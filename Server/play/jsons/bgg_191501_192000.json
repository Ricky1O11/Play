It includes over a dozen scenarios from Hyder Ali's defeat of the British in the First Mysore War in 1767 to Britain's final conquest of the Sikhs in 1846. Colorful leaders of the time are all present: Hyder Ali and Tippoo of Mysore. Sir Arthur Wellesley, the &quot;sepoy general&quot; who would become Duke of Wellington. The brilliant Madhav Rao of the Marathas. France's Admiral Suffren. Zaman Shah of Afghanistan, and the Sikh ruler Ranjit Singh.

The map is a painting of South Asia, with a network of areas and routes between them laid over it. Generals move their armies along these routes, attempting to conquer territory for their nation. Fleets control the seas around India; the locals have very little seapower, and Britain outnumbers France on the seas.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved by dice rolls, with larger armies casting more dice.

Each game board shows nine dice, and once arranged the completed grid shows 36 dice, with the dice being numbered 1-6 and showing six colors, with each combination of number and color appearing exactly once. Roll the color die and number die to determine the starting location for the transparent robot, then mark this space with the transparent starting token.<br/><br/>In a round, roll the two dice to determine the target space; you can mark this space with a transparent victory token or simply have everyone remember which space they're trying to reach. Everyone simultaneously tries to figure out how to move the robot to the target space, and to move the robot, it must move orthogonally to a space that shares either the color or number of its current location. If the robot starts on &quot;3-green&quot;, for example, it can move orthogonally to any space that shows either a 3 or is green; if you'd move it to &quot;5-green&quot;, it can now once again move orthogonally to any space that shows either a 5 or is green; and so on.<br/><br/>As soon as a player has a solution, they yell out the number of moves, then take the robot and demonstrate the solution. If the solution takes exactly the number of moves claimed, the player earns a victory token; if not, the player gives one of their victory tokens (if they have any) to the player with the fewest tokens. In either case, the former target space becomes the new starting space for the next round.<br/><br/>If any player possesses five victory tokens, they win! If the 25 victory tokens are distributed before someone collects five, then whoever holds the most tokens wins, with ties being possible.<br/><br/>Expert Micro Robots players can increase the challenge of the game by placing the target victory token on the board, then rolling the two dice once again. The players must now determine a solution that first moves the robot to the space showing on the dice, then to the final destination.<br/><br/>The transparent robot in Micro Robots can also be used in Ricochet Robots. This robot moves like any other robot in that game except that for an additional move it can pass through a wall instead of stopping at it. It cannot move through the central barrier or the exterior walls, and the only target space on which it can land is the colored vortex.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English-only edition 2016", "English/German first edition", "French first edition", "Spanish / portuguese first edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "name": "Micro Robots", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Modular Board"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "216", "average": "6.35549", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["DJ125: Micro Robots (2016) Andreas Kuhnekath"]}, "191544": {"poll": [], "name": "Nancy Drew: #32 Sea of Darkness", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows/Mac Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Nancy Drew Adventure"], "videogametheme": ["Crime", "Ocean / Sea", "Puzzle"], "videogamefranchise": ["Nancy Drew"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Her Interactive"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure", "Point-and-Click", "Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Macintosh", "Windows"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Her Interactive"], "description": "The celebrated ship &ldquo;Heerlijkheid,&rdquo; is usually the centerpiece of an Icelandic town&rsquo;s local festival.

At the start of the game, each player draws three animal tiles, chooses one of these tiles, and places it on a bracket of his ark without showing it to the other players.<br/><br/>The leftover animals that players initially drew begin forming what will become a single animal collective in the center of the table. The total number of animals in the collective is based on the number of players, but one animal in the collective will always be face-down. Each player also starts with one food crate and may never have more than five food crates at any time.<br/><br/>On each turn, a player has two options: (a) split a collective of animals into two groups and take a food crate, or (b) take one of the animal collectives into their ark by paying a food crate for each animal in that group. As players choose their group of animals, they drop out of the turn. The first player to drop out of a turn starts the next turn.

From there they terrorized the surrounding country, raiding the villages of Alice, Greenbriar and Ends Meet until at last the rangers gathered against the Cult and overthrew it.

A select band of bards have traveled the earth acquiring the legends of the most unbelievable legends of Goblins past. The stories of their conquests are unlike traditional legends, crafted from improbable accomplishments, incalculable risk, and a nearly absurd amount of luck. The epic tales of these forgotten heroes belie their diminutive stature.

Each season, as their young men and women approach adulthood, they prepare for the ceremony of St&aacute;la, in which the youths demonstrate both their worthiness as defenders and providers for the tribe, and their attractiveness to prospective mates. The Azon&eacute; value equally skill in deadly combat, and the ability to construct and wear battle garb of exquisite beauty. It is the balance of these two traits that make the Azon&eacute; &quot;butterfly warriors&quot; (or &quot;Tyri&aacute;&quot;) truly great.<br/><br/>User Summary:<br/>At the start of the game, each player creates three beasts, each with a rating from 1 to 9, for a total of 13 points distributed between them. Then each round, for three rounds, the players choose to split 10 points between the beauty of their battle gear and its effectiveness.<br/>If the effectiveness is not high enough, then the beast could wound the character (with a second wound killing them). But after facing three attacks, it is the surviving player with the highest beauty that wins. However if the total combat effectiveness is too low, then the village will be overrun by beasts in the end.<br/><br/>"}, "191692": {"rpgdesigner": ["James P.

In order to increase their power, the contenders for the throne rally the country and its people around themselves.<br/><br/>Who will make the best use of the influence of important personalities and engage his competitors in conflicts without suffering damage himself? Rival Kings is a stalwart card game from HUCH! &amp; friends.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each cycle, each player chooses one Character card and places it face down in front of him. Once all players have done so, they turn them over simultaneously. The Character cards determine the order of play, the number of possible actions, and potential conflicts. Low-ranking characters have more actions at their disposal, but they may act only after the higher-ranking characters. In addition, each character may come into conflict with certain other characters. When this happens, the higher-ranking character may take one action from the inferior character and carry it out immediately; this action is then no longer available to the lower ranked during his turn.<br/><br/>After the Character cards have been played and potential conflicts have been resolved, the action phase begins. Now, depending on the action, a player can take money, get rid of Conflict markers, recruit subjects, or buy a building. Players try to secure good combinations of buildings and subjects for themselves in order to get a high score in the end. Besides this, the subjects recruited during the game provide different advantages that can have a crucial impact on the course of the game. However, only one subject is active per player &ndash; if a new Subject card is added, it covers the player's previously laid-out bonus.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as one of the card piles has been depleted.

But who really has what it takes to gain control over both relics and therefore claim the throne of Asgard?<br/><br/>Thunder &amp; Lightning, a reimplementation of Hera and Zeus, features the same gameplay as the earlier design, but with larger decks of cards with a different distribution of powers.<br/><br/>In the game, each player starts with nine cards in hand, then places three cards face down in their first row, with these rows butting against one another and each player having space for four rows in their playing area. If a player loses a card in a row, then any cards in the same column behind this card slide forward to fill the empty slot. On a turn, a player has as many action points as the number of columns they have in the playing area. They can use these action points to draw cards, play cards to the battlefield, play a mythological card for its power, or challenge an opponent's card.<br/><br/>To challenge, the player chooses a card in their first row that abuts an opponent's card, then reveals both of them. Most cards have a strength value (0-7), and the card with the lower strength value is discarded, with the opponent's other cards in the same column then sliding forward.<br/><br/>If a player cannot use all of their actions or has no actions (due to having no cards on the battlefield) or loses control of Odin's Crown/Ring, then they lose the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "French first edition"], "name": "Thunder & Lightning", "playingtime": "40", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Hand Management", "Secret Unit Deployment"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "372", "average": "7.39513", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 25 - What Do Those \u201cX\u2019s\u201d Stand for, Again?", "Episode 26 - The Must Play Two Player Games of 2016\u2026as of June", "Episode 37 - Our 2016 Enthusiastic Seals of Approval!", "Episode 73- Two Player Games"]}, "191965": {"poll": [], "name": "Will Fight for Food", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows/Mac/Linux Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2848333.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Pyrodactyl"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Beat 'em Up", "RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Linux", "Macintosh", "Windows"], "average": "5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Pyrodactyl"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2848333_t.jpg", "description": "Jared Casey Dent was a wrestler in a down-and-out bloodstained middle American town.<br/><br/>He lost his own tournament in disgrace and vanished into the night.<br/><br/>Now he&rsquo;s back, and he&rsquo;s going to set his life straight using one of these time tested techniques:<br/><br/>Brutal violence / His wavering, hamfisted brand of subtle persuasion / Side questing for loose change / All of the options<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "191966": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Eddy Sterckx"], "poll": [], "name": "Waterloo Squares", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Deck / Pool Building", "Simulation"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2846096_t.jpg", "average": "8", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2846096.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Napoleonic", "Print & Play", "Wargame"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "Waterloo Squares is 2-player entry-level wargame of the battle of Waterloo 1815 played on a map which represents the historical battlefield.<br/><br/>One player assumes the role of Napoleon and takes command of the French, the other player represents the Wellington/Bl&uuml;cher combination and will command the Allies (British, Dutch/Belgian, minor German states and Prussian)<br/><br/>The Light Blue and Dark Blue counters represent the French forces, the Grey counters the Prussians and the Red counters all the other Allied forces.

In der kleinen Stadt Elorica an der K&uuml;ste der Kristallsee k&ouml;nnen die Abenteurer erfahren, was die Motive der Korsaren sind, und auf ungew&ouml;hnliche Methoden zur&uuml;ckgreifen, wenn es darum geht, ihnen unrechtm&auml;&szlig;ig erworbenes Eigentum wieder abzunehmen.<br/><br/>Wenn man in der Eint&ouml;nigkeit hoher See auf ein Bootsdorf fahrender Schausteller trifft, verspricht das Abwechslung, Spannung und Spektakel. All das erwartet auch die Abenteurer, wenn auch anders, als sie oder die Gaukler sich das gedacht h&auml;tten.

A number of bonus buttons, which have 1-4 holes, are stacked on the table, again based on the number of players. Going clockwise around the table, each player (after the first) places one loop on the table so that it surrounds exactly one spool, then draws a word tag from the box and attaches it to this loop, then places one spool in one section of loop(s) that has no spool in it. (Think of a Venn diagram; two overlapping circles form three sections, with one section having both circles in common and two sections being part of only one circle.)<br/><br/>Once all of the spools have been placed, everyone races to think of words, names, or phrases for each spool based on the word tags associated with that spool.

Once the final button is grabbed, players can't write more answers. Players then compare answers, crossing out those they have in common with someone else, then scoring points for the remaining answers; each answer is worth as many points as the number of loops around the spool with the same number.

Food production is being disrupted around the world, and demand is surging for dwindling resources. In the decades to come there will be countless crises, like economic collapse, political revolutions, disastrous weather, failed states, disruptive technologies with unknown consequences, and much more. The only certainty is that when people are faced with famine, they will always migrate and raid their neighbors before starving.<br/><br/>Set in the near future, the players take on the roles of the USA, Western Europe, Russia, China, and India. Collectively, these five major global powers dominate the world&rsquo;s economic, military, political, social, and technological powers. By cooperating and strategizing, the players must put their collective powers into actions to lower carbon emissions while resolving the many crises around the world.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/>The world is divided into 15 regions, each with its own population, food capacity, carbon emissions, sociopolitical stability, and likely number of people that would suffer when hit by famine. At the start of each turn a number of crises are revealed to all the players. Each crisis is associated with one of the 15 regions. The players must then decide what actions they will take, unilaterally or jointly, to resolve which crises by implementing their economic, military, political, social, technological powers. Alongside dealing with crises around the world, the players must quickly reduce global carbon emissions and prevent their own regions from becoming a failed state. This can be done by implementing green energies and developing advanced technologies. At the end of each turn the global temperature rises, and if it exceeds a new threshold then food capacity is reduced in every region worldwide. If any region loses its ability to feed its population then famine strikes, starting a chain reaction of refugees, conflicts, failed states, and megadeath! Players must devise innovative solutions to tackle Earth&rsquo;s most urgent problems. Act too selfishly, and you accelerate humanity&rsquo;s demise. Act too altruistically, and you could be overrun by climate refugees and chaos.<br/><br/>EVERYONE LOSES WHEN&hellip;<br/>If the global temperature rises by six degrees Celsius, there won&rsquo;t be any way to stop the runaway greenhouse. It will result in Earth&rsquo;s sixth mass extinction, possibly the greatest one in geologic time! Still, a rising global temperature alone is not the only thing that can bring the end of human civilization. Some regions of the world and its people may be forsaken, mired in conflicts, epidemics, and anarchy. If the chaos consumes most of the world then there will be no safe-haven left for anyone, and all nations will inevitable become failed states. If either condition is met before the end of this century then it is a Global Collapse . . . the beginning of the end of all human civilization!<br/><br/>YOU WIN WHEN&hellip;<br/>If the two conditions for losing are not met by the end of this century, and your region is not a failed state, then humanity is saved and your civilization leads the world into the next century.<br/><br/>"}, "191985": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Dan Letzring"], "poll": [], "name": "Ph.

NATO and Russia stare each other down in a &quot;coopetittion&quot; in the region, and tensions rise meteorically as not so &quot;friendly&quot; fire incidents occur. The West tightens sanctions against Russia and ratchets up its rhetoric; Russia, meanwhile, attempting to regain a place in global power politics, responds with sanctions of its own against Turkey and starts low-level cyber warfare and &quot;little green men&quot; incidents in the Baltics. Tempers flare across the world, Turkey shoots down another Russian plane while Russian SAM batteries shoot down a Turkish F-16 in retaliation. Russia declares enough is enough, decides on war with NATO, and invades the Baltics and Poland. Belorussia, knowing where it's bread is buttered, joins in.

The Russians are not the behemoth of the Cold War, but they possess good material and a much better trained army. The Baltics may fall quickly, although their forces may put up some resistance and make an appearance as reinforcements, and the front quickly establishes itself in eastern Poland as the Russian 6th and 20th Armies push forward while NATO rushes forces into the area spearheaded by the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps and followed up by whatever nation's troops respond to the Article 5 declaration.

That said, the Standard Game rules encompass a fairly straightforward ruleset that will, we think, be considered pretty &quot;easy to learn&quot; by experienced wargamers. So players who choose to play Standard Game scenarios can have a relatively quick game when that's what suits them. The real flavor of a war in the theatre, though, comes through in the Advanced Game, where you get much more control over airpower and can more clearly see each side's strengths and weaknesses.
