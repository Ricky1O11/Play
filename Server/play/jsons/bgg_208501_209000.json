Planet Surprise is a game in which you can fulfill your dreams of exploring the universe. Perhaps you can find out what's hidden on the planet in the shape of a tennis ball, or what's in the mysterious flying box?<br/><br/>The game is wonderfully minimalist as each player has only one scratch card (similar to a scratch ticket). On your turn, you can land on a planet, which means that you scratch the scratching layer of one planet (with a fingernail or a coin) and look at what is hiding underneath. You will always find a point value underneath, positive or negative, and also certain surprises in the form of funny graphics. The goal is to uncover the planet with the highest score. (During ten actions, you will uncover about ten planets out of sixteen.) Each set includes different deployment of points and different jokes.<br/><br/>Instead of scratching, you can navigate the opponent to land on a planet of your choice, without doubt the most beautiful one of those that you discovered. Some actions will allow you to gain insight into your opponent's game so that you might know better on which planets it pays to visit and which to avoid.<br/><br/>Planet Surprise originated as a little brother of a much larger project, a fantasy offline/online game with scratch cards called Scratch Wars. All you need to play Planet Surprise is one scratch card for each player, but they need to be all from the same set of cards (as players need to explore the same universe).<br/><br/>"}, "208941": {"poll": [], "name": "SHENZHEN I/O", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Linux Downloadable edition", "Macintosh Downloadable edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3485699.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Abstract", "Puzzle"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Zachtronics Industries"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle", "Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["Linux", "Macintosh", "Windows"], "videogamehonor": ["2016 Golden Geek Best Indie Video Game Nominee"], "average": "7.5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Zachtronics Industries"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3485699_t.jpg", "description": "BUILD CIRCUITS.

The Vampire Lords set out to destroy the town, while also battling each other for supremacy. You are a Vampire Lord in control of a crypt of creatures. The goal is to end the game with the most powerful crypt.  The game is played in a series of rounds as rival vampires build up their forces and deplete the village.  Every time the village square is emptied, the round ends and an event occurs. Many event effects are lasting; some favor the humans, while others favor the forces of darkness. The fourth time the square is cleared, Askwith is destroyed and the game is scored.<br/><br/>There are four character classes: Villagers, Vampire Hunters, Thralls, and Vampires, including Master Vampires, Lesser Vampires, and Turned Hunters. Players place their Vampires and Thralls in the &ldquo;crypt&rdquo; in front of them in order to be able to use them in play. The creatures in the crypt can be face up and active or face down, in shadows. Active creatures can directly attack the villagers, while creatures in shadows use stealth attacks. Thralls and turned hunters/slave vampires, when applicable, can also be used to defend a creature who has been targeted by a crypt attack.<br/><br/>Each turn, players draw 1 card and play 1 card, choosing to build up their crypts or use a hunter or strong villager to attack one of their rivals. During the next phases, players can use the skills of face-up cards and attack the village with direct attacks and stealth. Finally, crypt attacks and other residual actions from previous turns are resolved. During a crypt attack, the Hunter is supported by all of the Villagers in the square.<br/><br/>After the end of the fourth round, the game ends and the power value of all creatures in the crypt in front of each player are scored, along with any giant bat victory points. The player with the highest score is the reigning Vampire Lord!<br/><br/>Vampires and Villagers introduces an unusual semi-cooperative element. Players both attack the village in order to gain victory points and use the villagers against one another. A strong village is a useful weapon, but it can be used against you, as well. Vampires and Villagers is all about managing opposing goals &ndash; the successful player balances bringing about the end of rounds and the game quickly with strengthening their own crypt, while simultaneously preventing their opponents from doing the same.

Some are emblematic of glorious goodness, while others reek of ineffable evil and demoniac damnation, but each one can serve to make your campaign more exciting and your treasure hoards more interesting. They add delightful detail and innovative options for heroes and villains alike, whether found as captured plunder after the sack of an enemy fortress or recovered relics of a lost outpost or expedition, or even granted as a token of esteem by the crusader commanders who keep vigilant watch upon the demon-haunted borderlands. These items range from the militant to the mundane in this book, from weapons and shields to bindings, books, and music boxes.

It is also compatible, with minor adjustments, with other editions of Dungeons and Dragons, and similar games.

Player picking the most key cards at end of game wins the round. Each player can check off the score pad the capital they claim. In event of tie player with their home capital wins. Ties are very rare in the 252 test games from our 2 working prototypes. Only a few. The game is very exciting and has 6 special effects that can turn the game even more exciting. Ages 7-seniors even a 4 yr old can play. Very popular with children that when they got the first prototype they play 30 times in a few week period and most rounds last 45-60 minutes average. Special effects occur 20-30 times a round when the two effects match on the dice. 2 regular dice, 2 special effect dice, 6 prop planes on stands, 50 key cards, score pad of 50 states check list. Great thing about the game is not needing to answer the questions but a memorization of the key card(s) of each state capital. It is a fun race game to collect most capitals. Object is to stay away from the long routes needed to get to the capitals. It is normal to have more than one card in your hand due to the extra key and steal a key effect.<br/><br/>"}, "208569": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jeremy Anderson"], "poll": [], "name": "Shadowrift: Skittering Darkness", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Deck / Pool Building"], "yearpublished": "2017", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3183111_t.jpg", "average": "10", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Game Salute"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3183111.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Medieval"], "age": "13", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "This expansion to Shadowrift 2nd Edition introduces two new monster factions: the Restless Dead, featuring poltergeists; and the Cult of the Fang, featuring spiders!

Only half survived the winter. Who will you eat to be one of them?<br/><br/>Each player has a family of settlers (color coded), and a few hirelings or settlers outside that family. While individually named, all of these actually represent several people (you are not playing all 81 settlers).<br/><br/>You get points for each settler you have alive at the end of the game, with bonus points for healthy settlers, oldest settler, youngest settler and an intact family. Things you do in the game cause you to accumulate &quot;Shame&quot;, which are cards with random values that you draw but do not look at, and whoever has the highest Shame at the end of the game loses, regardless of their score.<br/><br/>Play proceeds in rounds, moving through a chronologically stacked Forage deck that represents the winter of 1846. Each round a player has a personal forage step, and then there is a group forage step. In the latter, players bid to acquire extra food and the bid is how much Shame they are willing to draw to get that food. The number of group forage cards available in a turn is always less than the number of players, so someone gets left out every time. Additionally one of the group forage cards is dealt face-down, so you do not know what it is. Ties in bidding are broken by the party leader, a role which rotates around the table. Players who do not get a forage card in the group step get to draw an Action card instead.<br/><br/>Then, everyone feeds their settlers, with weakened settlers costing less food than healthy ones. But weakened ones also do not forage as well. Losses from hunger have to follow a few simple rules, like none of your settlers can starve to death until all of them are weakened.<br/><br/>In addition to forage, there are action cards that players can acquire through the foraging process. These are the nasty things like murder and grave robbing and such. These can be played at any time and generally give you food, but unlike Forage cards, have an inherent Shame cost to play them.<br/><br/>This process continues until either the Forage deck empties or the &quot;final rescue&quot; card is drawn during March 1847. Since some cards are randomly removed from each game before play, you never know exactly when the game will end or what the weather will be and thus cannot plan for it.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7", "name": "Donner Party", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Co-operative Play", "Press Your Luck"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "16", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The First Roll - What's New on Kickstarter? - Episode 65: Monday, September 12th"]}, "208674": {"rpgartist": ["Robert Hemminger", "Sade"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Cymark", "rpgdesigner": ["A.

To emerge triumphant, you must learn to negotiate and manipulate your opponents ruthlessly.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>Each player is dealt a hidden mafioso identity (E.g. Godfather, Don, Informant) at the start of the game. Scoring conditions are specific to each identity, and the score for each player will be tallied after 5 rounds of gameplay.<br/><br/>Much of Lawless Empire revolves around dice placements. Dice are tactically allocated to the various plans in the fight for bribery tokens, lucre tokens, new soldati, and control of syndicates.<br/><br/>Players can ask for assistance from other players after they gain control of a syndicate. Controlling or assisting a syndicate will allow players to give hidden orders to the syndicate. There are 2 types of orders with varying strengths: to secure or to sabotage. Orders given to syndicates will be revealed at the end of 5 rounds to determine if each syndicate is secured or sabotaged. Depending on your mafioso, you will score based on how many syndicates are secured or sabotaged, and/or whether you control or assist the syndicates.<br/><br/>The distinctive feature of Lawless Empire shines through its workings of dice control and interactions, abetted by soldati power and scheme cards. Concealed scheme cards are played on each plan by the players, sneakily altering how each individual plan is won. For&nbsp;example, a plan is normally won by the player with the highest total value of dice allocated to it, but the &ldquo;Underhand Attacks&rdquo; scheme card dictates that the player with the lowest total value wins instead. On the other hand, your soldati will grant you the ability to control the dice (including your opponent&rsquo;s) after their placement (e.g. to move or exchange dice around plans, or even rotate a dice to any value). This combination of allocation, scheme cards, and soldato abilities presents a fresh take on the otherwise luck-dependent dice mechanics, thus ensuring a thrilling and compelling game without repetition.<br/><br/>The hidden elements in the game (mafioso, scheme cards, syndicate orders) provide a good setting for players to bluff, negotiate, persuade, and trash talk. However, players who are intimidated by such interactions can be assured that the game can be won by outwitting everyone.<br/><br/>"}, "208737": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["DOC Version 1.1"], "rpgseries": ["Old Style Netbooks"], "name": "The Netbook of Armour", "rpgdesigner": ["Hugo Chesshire"], "rpgproducer": ["Hugo Chesshire", "Ole Andreas Ringdal"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3175934.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["AD&D Second Edition (2e) Compatible Products"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3175934_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>This netbook was written principally for use with Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition).

In this version everything is bigger, the players have boards with dry erase markers in place of the original paper and pencil.  This edition is also for up to 8 players instead of only 5 in the original game.  The biggest change in this edition, though, is that on the back of the regular player boards are the Qwixx Mixx boards which have the colors scrambled throughout the different lines, which changes many of the strategies while keeping the mechanisms largely the same.<br/><br/>The rules for Qwixx:<br/><br/>Qwixx is a quick-playing dice game in which everyone participates, no matter whose turn it is. Each player has a scoresheet with the numbers 2-12 in rows of red and yellow and the numbers 12-2 in rows of green and blue. To score points you want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it's to the right of all marked-off numbers in the same row.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player rolls six dice: two white and one of each of the four colors listed above. Each player can choose to mark off the sum of the two white dice on one of their four rows, then the active player can choose to mark off the sum of one colored die and one white die in the row that's the same color as the die. The more marks you can make in a row, the higher your score for that row. Fail to cross off a number when you're the active player, however, and you must mark one of four penalty boxes on your scoresheet. If you mark off the 2 or 12 in a row and have at least five numbers marked in that row, you get to also mark off the padlock symbol in that row, locking everyone else out of this color.<br/><br/>When either a player has four penalty boxes marked or a second color is locked, the game ends immediately. Players then tally their points for each color, sum these values, then subtract five points for each marked penalty box.

The game board is octagonal, and each space is the intersection of a horizontal, vertical, and two diagonal lines.

They only can move one space, and a player wins when they surround their opponent's node. Units are akin to pawns in chess. They are the main troops in the game and form the basis of each player's strategy. Each player has one node and eight units throughout the game.<br/><br/>Unlike chess, however, the placement of the nodes on the board also determines how the units can move. The lines that extend in eight directions from the space a node occupies are called &quot;lines of communication.&quot; If a unit is located along a line of communication the unit can move, whether it's the player's node or their opponent's. If the unit moves into a space that is also along the same line as a node, it can move again. But if a unit moves out of line or starts a turn out of line, it can't move.<br/><br/>A player's turn involves moving as many pieces as they want as many spaces as they want in order to defend their own node and attack their opponent's node. Every turn asks the players to make strategic decisions about when to attack, when to defend, and how to do both with only eight units.
