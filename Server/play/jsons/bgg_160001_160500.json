Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word. This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.<br/><br/>In Clue, players move from room to room in a mansion to solve the mystery of: who done it, with what, and where? Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board. Players must move to a room and then make an accusation against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon. The player to the left must show one of any cards accused to the accuser if in that player's hand. Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file. To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more accusations. Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding they will know what cards are in the secret file. A great game for those who enjoy reasoning and thinking things out.<br/><br/>In Sorry!, players race their four game pieces from Start around the board to Home. By turning over a card from the draw deck and following its instructions, players move their pieces around the game board, switch places with players, and knock opponents' pieces off the track and back to their Start position.<br/><br/>Yahtzee is a classic dice game played with 5 dice. Each player's turn consists of rolling the dice up to 3 times in hope of making 1 of 13 categories. Examples of categories are 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, straight, full house, etc. Each player tries to fill in a score for each category, but this is not always possible. When all players have entered a score or a zero for all 13 categories, the game ends and total scores are compared.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition 2001"], "name": "Family Game Night Book and Game Set: Scrabble, Clue, Sorry, Yahtzee", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Tile Placement"], "average": "5", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Cluedo", "Scrabble", "Sorry!", "Yahtzee"]}, "160002": {"poll": [], "name": "Boxhead: Biever & Baby", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Web browser edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2051464.png", "videogameseries": ["Boxhead"], "videogametheme": ["Zombies"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Sean Cooper Games"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG", "Tower Defense"], "videogameplatform": ["Web Browser"], "average": "3", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2051464_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>The instalment Boxhead: Biever &amp; Baby in the Boxhead series sees players assume the role of 'Justin Biever' or 'Baby Gaga' to fight off waves of zombies.

Howard, is a scenario-based semi-cooperative asymmetric miniatures board game. One player is the Opponent, playing the Opposition forces, and the other players (1 to 4) play Conan and his companions: Shevatas the thief, Hadrathus the Priest/Sorcerer, Belit the pirate queen, Valeria the warrior, etc. The game is based purely on Robert E. Howard's novels and short stories (and not the movies or other non-Howardian material). The publisher has hired Patrice Louinet, a Howard expert, to make sure the art and the scenarios are compatible with Howard's vision.<br/><br/>Each game is a scenario, played on a map. There will be several maps &mdash; Pictish Village, Underground temple, Tavern, Pirate ship, etc. &mdash; and each map can have several scenarios set on it. The game is fast, one hour approximately. It's possible to play several scenarios in a campaign, but you can also play each scenario individually. There will be a dozen playable scenarios in the base box.<br/><br/>At the beginning of a scenario, players choose their team (Conan and two or three other heroes). The Opponent gathers all the miniatures (picts, Necromancer, skeleton warriors, monsters, etc.), tokens, cards from the chosen scenario. The game usually plays in a limited number of turns (ten, for instance). Each scenario can have very different objectives: find the princess captured by picts and hidden in a hut and leave the camp before the pict hunters return; find the magical key to open a sealed door, steal the jewel and leave; kill the Necromancer by the end of turn 10; survive by the end of turn 10; escape the prison; etc.<br/><br/>During their turn, the heroes can activate or rest. If they activate, they can spend &quot;gems&quot; from their energy pool to do all sorts of actions: move, fight (melee or distance), defend, pick a lock, reroll, etc. If they rest, they can move a lot of gems from their &quot;spent&quot; pool box to their &quot;available&quot; pool box. When they take an action, they throw a number of dice equal to the number of gems they put in their action. There are three different kinds of dice: yellow (the weaker dice), orange (medium) and red (strong). Each character has a color based on their specialty: Conan throws red dice in combat while the Sorcerer throws yellow dice in combat; the thief throws red dice in Manipulation actions, while Conan throws orange dice; etc. Each player can have equipment cards (armor, magic potions, weapons, etc.) which give them bonuses on their dice rolls.<br/><br/>The Opponent plays differently. He uses a board with eight slidable tiles, plus his own Energy gems. Each tile corresponds to one unit (1 to 3 miniatures) on the game mat, and all of the miniature abilities are written on this tile (movement, armor, attack, special abilities). The tile position on the board corresponds to the numbers 1-8. The Opponent has a pool of energy gems and each time he activates one unit, he needs to spend a number of gems matching the tile placement: tile#1 costs 1 energy gem, tile#2 costs 2 gems, etc. Whatever tile the Opponent chooses to activate, he spends the corresponding energy cost (moving his energy gems from the available pool to the spent pool), then takes the tile out and moves it to the end of the sliding track: If he wants to activate this unit again, it will cost him 8 gems, because the unit is now on position 8. The Opponent can activate a maximum of two tiles, and he regains only a certain number of gems each turn (depending on the scenario).<br/><br/>In a typical scenario, the heroes need to accomplish something and the Opponent wins if the heroes fail to reach their objective &mdash; but in some scenarios, the Opponent has his own objectives and the Heroes win if they prevent him from accomplishing his goal.<br/><br/>Components (according to the back of the box):<br/><br/>     16 spell cards (in either English or French)<br/>     39 equipment cards (in either English or French)<br/>     60 tiles (actually 75, see below)<br/>     161 tokens<br/>     8 Hero sheets (one side in English, the other in French)<br/>     4 player aid sheets (one side in English, the other in French)<br/>     1 turn counter sheet (both sides in English)<br/>     1 Hero rule book (in either English or French)<br/>     1 Overlord rulebook (13 scenarios) (in either English or French)<br/>     2 map boards<br/>     15 dice<br/>     75 &quot;gems&quot; (blue and red)<br/>     25 coloured bases (5 each in red, orange, green, blue, purple)<br/>     106 miniatures (plastic)<br/>     1 Overlord board (plastic)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The tiles need to be looked at more closely. 13 come in English-French pairs, another 35 are in the edition's language (either French or English), and the remaining 14 tiles come in non-lingual pairs (two each of Khosatral Khel, Skuthus, Thak, Zaporavo, and Zogar Sag, plus four Thog). A functional set of tiles is thus 62 strong, the remaining 27 tiles being set aside.

These linked adventures feature:<br/><br/>     swashbuckling, sin, investigation, and insanity familiar to fans of Green Ronin&rsquo;s popular Freeport, City of Adventure setting<br/>     new spells, new magic items (from minor to near-artifact level), new monsters, and new fully-statted Freeport NPCs<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Dark Deeds is fully-integrated into the history and ongoing storylines of the Freeport setting, and it can be used individually or in a level-spanning mini-campaign.<br/><br/>Something is horribly wrong in Freeport.

The two races- True Beasts and Anthros- can fit together nicely in a single campaign, where fur-less humans are the odd men out.<br/><br/>The main differences between True Beasts and Anthros is that while True Beasts are a very modular player race, they lack the infinite options offered to custom-built Anthros. Physically, they are quadrupedal magical beasts, rather than humanoids. They are also more all ages than some the more carnal possibilities offered by Anthros, and designed for more traditional fantasy adventuring.<br/><br/>"}, "160064": {"rpgdesigner": ["Steven J.

If we can secure it and capture the enemy officers, we should be able to completely confuse and paralyze enemy forces all along this front. We have our orders men, let&rsquo;s take this castle.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;How Sarge? Did we bring a battering ram sir?&rdquo; [Laughter from the squad]<br/><br/>&ldquo;Something like that.&rdquo; [Hands him a dynamite bundle] &ldquo;Thanks for volunteering private.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Its time for war! Every general needs a war room to keep track of the units under his command. Whether it is used as a base for meeting with your superiors or an enemy command center to take over in a military campaign, it makes a sublime stage for a pulp action military game. The room can also be used as a war room monitoring conflagrations that flare up around the world for the League of Nations or United Nations for a game focusing more on diplomacy.<br/><br/>War Room is a single room, internal view map of a military command center featuring a large table with a world map of Earth for the use of tracking troop movements as well as desk telephones to relay that information and orders to men in the field. This product includes a 360-degree panoramic view from the center of the room.<br/><br/>The world map of Earth could easily be replaced, just print out a different world map and place it over the center table instead.<br/><br/>War Room is intended for use in modern games.<br/><br/>Adventure hook for use with this product.<br/><br/>Decapitate the Enemy: A fortified enemy castle is being used as a base for an enemy war room communicating and relaying tactical data to units in the vicinity. Bombardment with bombers has proven ineffectual, as flak guns have been placed in castle towers, the courtyard, and anywhere else with enough space and a view of the skies above. Heavy tanks have been placed at the front of the gate. They don&rsquo;t have enough gas to move much, but the combination of their cannons and the flaks won&rsquo;t let armor get anywhere near the place. Heavy enemy activity in the area also hampers ground forces moving artillery into an entrenched nearby position where it can bombard the castle from afar.<br/><br/>The Player Characters are a special forces team that have been &ldquo;volunteered&rdquo; for the dubious honor of being dropped behind enemy lines with the task of finding a way into the castle from the rear, sneaking into the castle, and then securing the war room and capturing the enemy officers to completely decapitate the enemy command and control in the area. The hope is this will break enemy morale forcing them to retreat from the region or surrender as they are cut off from support due to uncoordinated unit movements.<br/><br/>The Player Characters are given a wide array of special weapons to choose from including flamethrowers, heavy machine guns, rocket launchers, grenades, dynamite, sniper rifles, submachine guns, petrol bombs, or anything else they can think of. They also have a radio to call in air support as a distraction when they attempt to enter the enemy base.<br/><br/>Maps that work well with this scenario include our Western Keep for the aboveground castle, The Cellar (as the basement area just before getting to the War Room for a good old shootout), and finally the War Room where they must subdue the enemy officers through any means at their disposal.<br/><br/>"}, "160065": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2255778.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "10", "boardgameartist": ["Beatrice Braun-Fock"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Jos.

This represents the fi rst volume of what may eventually become a collection of supplements similar to the Alien Compendium, Star Compendium, and Threats From Beyond. All of these resources increased the appeal of the Star*Drive game, adding flavor and richness to a campaign setting that already holds everything sci-fi gamers could ever desire. Hopefully, Gridcasts can live alongside them.<br/><br/>In that regard, these TVN reports all attempt to stay as true to Star*Drive source material as possible. Every effort was made to research and verify any references to original Star*Drive facts revealed in the earlier products published by Wizards of the Coast. This should help Gamemasters to more easily integrate them within their ongoing campaigns. It is also recommended that special attention be paid to the dates that accompany each TVN report for an idea of where it falls within the greater Star*Drive timeline.<br/><br/>"}, "160227": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Shane Gelven"], "poll": [], "name": "Chaos Ninjas", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Memory", "Take That"], "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2258530_t.png", "average": "5.375", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)", "The Game Crafter, LLC"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2258530.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Chaos Ninjas is a light card game that combines both strategy and take-that elements.<br/>In Chaos Ninjas you play the role of a Warlord who is hiring Ninjas.<br/>You are trying to be the first player to have six unique Defender Ninjas in front of your play area.<br/>On your turn you only perform one action, either take a card or play a card.<br/>Very easy to learn and easy to play.<br/><br/>"}, "160228": {"poll": [], "name": "fehde", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement"], "yearpublished": "1976", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2046139_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Spear's Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2046139.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Reise-Steckspiel edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "A tactical game for two.<br/>Your goal is to capture the enemies knight, represented by a spherical peg.

At first glance, TAU seems to be a lot of different things: a card game, a role-playing game, and a collaborative storytelling game. The rules for such a game could be ridiculously complicated, but we have pared it down to the simplest elements to make the game easy to learn and to have as few limits as possible on the group's creativity.<br/><br/>TAU is played with communal storytelling, meaning that it does not need pencil, paper, or dice; only the Players' minds are needed to determine outcomes.  The game usually starts out with the Players finding their characters facing a series of potentially lethal challenges from which in all likelihood the players' characters will not survive.  The winner is the Player of the last Character standing, or at least still alive - plenty of games have been won prone!  Remember, TAU (T) is the Greek letter symbolizing death and rebirth.  Don't be afraid to take creative and entertaining risks!  There's always another round!<br/><br/>These rules are optimized for a group of five: four Players, and one Storyteller.<br/><br/>User added information:<br/><br/>TAU has three phases: the Trick phase, the Character phase, and the Storytelling phase.<br/><br/>The Trick phase is similar to a standard trick-taking game such as Hearts or Spades.  Each card in the game contains not only attributes for RPG characters, but also a suit and rank of a standard 52-card deck.  Only the Players take part in the Trick phase - the Storyteller never has any cards.<br/><br/>The Character phase consists of the Players taking one card from each trick they won and creating their character with the results.  If a player won no tricks, he takes three cards from the discards of the other Players.<br/><br/>The Storytelling phase is the RPG phase.  The Storyteller (GM) creates a situation in which the Player Characters are in grave danger.  The Players can react with their Character cards, but eventually all will die.  The last Player Character alive wins the round, and another round is then dealt out and played through all three phases.  Players play as many rounds as desired, but the essence of the game is that all Characters always die!<br/><br/>"}, "160244": {"rpgartist": ["Robert Hemminger", "Louis Porter, Jr. Design Studio"], "statistics": [], "name": "Heroes Weekly (Vol 2, Issue 3 - The Archer)", "rpgdesigner": ["Charles Smith"], "rpgproducer": ["Robert Hemminger"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2745386.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Heroes Weekly"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Archer", "Terrain Tiles"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "rpgpublisher": ["Avalon Games"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2745386_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Archer Advanced Class<br/><br/>A great new advanced class this week with the super archer.

These tales of cops and robbers, sleuths and spies, and other forms of modern action constantly play out in people&rsquo;s imagination. With that premise in mind, we present this book that allows you to craft a contemporary setting of your very  own, populated by evil villains and desperate situations that call upon the very best your heroes have to offer.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a game of your imagination where you get to tell stories by taking on the rolls of the characters that you create. It&rsquo;s a game that offers a multitude of choices &ndash; more choices than even the most sophisticated computer game, because the only limit to what you can do is what you can imagine. The story unfolds like a movie, except all the action takes place within your own imagination.<br/><br/>This volume, the Modern Campaign Setting for the 4th edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons&reg; game, offers a wealth of new character options, including a new race and new classes, new skills, and new feats. It introduces the craft power source used by the Smart Hero, along with a new approach to summoning creatures.<br/><br/>Chapter 1 introduces a new race for a high tech campaign world. The Robot makes its d&eacute;but within these pages and provides different options depending on the Progress Level of the campaign. Six new classes make up most of chapter 2. These classes are the Charismatic Hero, Fast Hero, Psychic Hero, Smart Hero, Strong Hero, and the Tough Hero. To add a bit a flare new hybrid classes are also given for each of the main classes for this book, and are compatible with the fantasy setting hybrid classes for more customization. Also in this chapter are 6 new epic destinies that take full advantage of a modern setting and allow your imagination to take off.<br/><br/>Chapter 3 includes a variety of new options for characters of every class. First are new skills that allow a character to fully interact with the modern world, and additions to older skills found in the Players Handbook. New feats provide additional opportunities for characters to specialize and customize their characters to fully obtain what they had envisioned for it. New backgrounds called occupations that better reflect a modern environment are also present and provide the players the ability to adjust their character in more subtle ways. New to the 4thedition setting but found in earlier settings, Leadership and Reputation make a comeback and allow players to fully realize the true power of a modern campaign. Leadership and reputation are also compatible with the fantasy version of 4thedition in order to bring something new to the table.<br/><br/>The meat and bones of chapter 4 are  the weapons and equipment for all progress levels. New to the 4th edition system is the Gadget and Upgrade system  which  allows Players and Dungeon Masters the ability to fully customize a weapons and equipment from scratch or simply upgrade already designed items. Also new to the 4th edition system is updated vehicle operation rules and crafting rules to create your own equipment.<br/><br/>Chapter 5, the final chapter contains all the fluff that helps you fully immerse yourself in a modern or futuristic setting. Everything in this chapter is optional and should only be used to enhance an adventure. Within this chapter you will find rules for living and lifestyle, space travel, mutations, superpowers, and much more.<br/><br/>"}, "160269": {"rpgartist": ["Robert Hemminger"], "statistics": [], "name": "Heroes Weekly (Vol 3, Issue 2 - Iconoclast)", "rpgdesigner": ["Charles Smith"], "rpgproducer": ["Robert Hemminger"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2748316.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Heroes Weekly"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Figure Flats", "Iconoclast", "Iconoclast"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "rpgpublisher": ["Avalon Games"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2748316_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Iconoclast<br/><br/>Super Robots gone wrong or just misunderstood.

These inventions run the range from the fairly linear to the outright ridiculous, including a beehive that can be harvested for food and beeswax, a system that allows the alpha to deploy automatons when they are destroyed, retributive sawblade and punching glove attacks, the introduction of robotic cannibalism, a new version of the flaskapult, and even a &quot;master radar&quot; for when the rest of the party needs to find which alley the tinker passed out in this time.<br/><br/>Product Features<br/><br/>     2 new innovations and 1 new greater innovation<br/>     20 new advanced inventions<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "160375": {"rpgartist": ["Raul Chavez", "Sergei Churbanov", "Luke Daniels", "Ovidiu Dascalu", "Raymond Gaustadnes", "Lars Lundberg", "Phill Lundberg", "Robert Schertz", "Hillary Wilson"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "statistics": [], "name": "Darkwood Adventure Arc 1: The Deft and the Deadly", "rpgdesigner": ["Nick Johnson", "Lars Lundberg"], "rpgproducer": ["Jesse Angle", "Curtis Edwards"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2037685.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Saga Roleplaying Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2037685_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>&ldquo;The Deft and the Deadly&rdquo; is the first adventure in a 5-book Adventure Arc for PCs levels 5-7.

During the course of this expedition, Don Lope de Aguirre (later known as The Madman and The Tyrant) assassinated the conquistador leading the expedition and the nobleman he propped up in his stead before taking over the expedition personally. Recognizing that El Dorado was a myth and that the only gold to be found was back in Peru, Aguirre declared himself Prince of Peru and changed the purpose of his expedition to overthrow the Pizzaros and take over the country for himself. Sailing down the Amazon and Orinoco rivers, Aguirre's expedition faced all manner of challenges in the form of disease, privation, navigation, lack of morale, and attacks from the natives, against whom Aguirre committed barbaric atrocities (there are portions of South America where Aguirre's name is still used as a curse today). Members of Aguirre's expedition discovered to their dismay that the most dangerous of all the challenges, however, was Aguirre's growing paranoia. One by one, Aguirre executed his own men when he grew suspicious of them, sometimes with cause, more often without. Ultimately, Aguirre managed to capture a Spanish fort before being besieged by government forces, when he was executed by one of his own men, one of the few survivors of his ill-fated expedition.<br/><br/>In the game, players will take on the role of one of the unfortunate members of Aguirre's expedition. Their goal? To accumulate enough influence to overthrow Aguirre before they are executed in turn. In the end, only one player will survive Aguirre&rsquo;s paranoia. Only one player will be able to accumulate enough influence to overthrow him. Only one player will emerge from the depths of hell on earth to tell the tale of The Tyrant Aguirre!<br/><br/>The principal game mechanics are role/action selection and set collection. Players will earn Influence (victory) Points through a variety of methods, including influencing prominent members of the expedition (the role/action selection part of the game), purchasing Supply Cards (the set collection part of the game), and overcoming thematic challenges. One of these challenges is the &quot;paranoia phase,&quot; in which one of the roles/actions is removed from the game every turn, resulting in a diminishing array of role/actions for players to choose from as the game progresses. The game challenges players to use reactive and adaptive strategy, as players must frequently shift and adjust what they want to do in the game according to the changing conditions of the game.<br/><br/>Aguirre is a fast-paced game for 2-6 players and lasts 30-90 minutes depending on the number of players.<br/><br/>"}, "160392": {"rpgdesigner": ["Rose Bailey", "Emily Care Boss", "Bryant Johnson", "Raffaele Manzo", "Epidiah Ravachol"], "statistics": [], "name": "Worlds Without Master (Volume 1, Issue 4 - Jun 2014)", "rpgartist": ["Bryant Johnson", "Rachel A.

As soon as the whole of the Tele-Portal network was powered up, they attacked, we guards tried to stop them but there were just too many of them ... and now there's only me left, my control circuitry is damaged, I can't switch my motors off, so the only thing I can do to slow down is slam the brake units on, but that doesn't do much good.<br/><br/>I must pick up the fuel cells and go through the Tele-Portal to soak up some more energy, it's running so low, so tired ...<br/><br/>OH NO!!!!

The robot can also brake, which means it both moves more slowly and has a tighter turning circle.<br/><br/>On each level, the robot needs to pick up four fuel cells, which immediately then move to surround the Tele-Portal. When all are collected, the Robot can go through the Tele-Portal to the next level.<br/><br/>Progress is hindered by aliens on screen, which can be shot. The robot starts with full batteries. Energy is lost through collisions with aliens, or using the brake. A bonus counts down while playing the level. This is added to the energy reserve when you complete the level.

This cabal has subtly manipulated events for hundreds of years according to the delicate schemes of its oldest and most patient members, so that key members of the cabal will be next in line when a power structure caves.<br/>     The Cult of Man: Fiercely anti-deistic, the Cult of Man rejects divinity as a distinct concept, holding that the difference between a bound spirit and a patron god is merely a matter of scale. They condemn the arrogance of gods in their self-righteousness. Its members tend to be older, of a learned and scholarly bent, and concerned with personal power (or a personal grudge against the divine) above all else.<br/>     The Lantern Collective: Known variously as the Silver Lanterns, Lumineers, Day Stars and a host of other names and aliases, it isn&rsquo;t entirely clear how far the organization&rsquo;s influence spreads. The Lantern Collective is devoted to the sacred pursuit of knowledge, and the subversion and sabotage of those who conceal that knowledge. It celebrates spirit binding for its ability to join the minds of the past with the minds of the present. Its own clandestine binding secrets, of course, are not included in this sacred calling, leading to not-occasional accusations of hypocrisy. Joining the Collective is not easy; typically it finds one before one finds it.<br/>     Path of Ia: A frighteningly well-equipped and well-spoken doomsday cult, the Path of Ia holds the firm belief that the fundamental truth of mortal existence exists at the very center of the world, and that all one needs to discover it is to physically split the planet open. To that end, they seek the assistance of their eldritch patron Ia to force open the planet and achieve blissful nirvana in its radiant depths.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "160405": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Manuel D.

This repeats until each player has played two cards. Then everyone reveals their hand, and whoever has the card that matches all the rules laid out in the round is the winner for having the &quot;true&quot; Cinderella.

It has long been known that our teeth are under constant attack form a form of oral bacteria known as Dentorium Kamikazium: The DK. Little has been known about the life cycle of the DK but the recent research has revealed a startling fact. Bacteriologists believe that the DK's life span was limited because the mechanism by which it attacked teeth led to its own destruction (see 'The Kamikazi Effect', Shimoto 1973.) What Shimoto did not realise however was that the DK's destruction was not permanent. It is able to rejuvenate after each attack upon a small tooth and this, far from having a short life is in fact immortal! This discovery has led inevitably to a radical change in our attitudes to tooth decay. No longer are we able to believe that decay can be eradicated completely. The indestructability of the DK means that we can only hope to reduce it by constant use of the toothbrush and toothpaste. On a happier note, the research has led to the development of DKX 11. This chemical has the effect of interrupting the normal DK cycle, thereby forcing it to rejuvenate early. When introduced into toothpaste, DKX 11 can extend the life of a tooth by as much as 90%. Those are the facts. This is the challenge. You have an limitless supply of Magico toothpaste (containing DKX 11) and three toothbrushes with which to prevent the DK's from destroying your teeth.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>Molar Maul is a bizarre game, where the player controls a toothbrush charged with keeping a mouth clean in the face of an onslaught of bacteria. The player must man&oelig;uvre the toothbrush to a tube, which will deposit some toothpaste. The teeth are initially yellow (presumably indicating normal dirt), but when attacked by the bacteria, they change colour through light and dark blue, to finally black when the tooth has completely decayed. An undecayed tooth can be brought back to white by brushing the tooth. Using ten squirts of toothpaste completes the level and the player moves on to a more dangerous set of bacteria. The player's toothbrush is not vulnerable to the bacteria, but losing 4 teeth to decay means that one of the three toothbrushes is lost.<br/><br/>Credits:<br/><br/>By John Gibson<br/><br/>"}, "160413": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2410759.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Clayton Grey"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Samuel Strick"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Laboratory Games"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2410759_t.png", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Horror", "Novel-based"], "description": "Arkham is a city under the constant threat of cosmic terror.

The supply lines created this way continue to reinforce the war zones until the orders are changed or the enemy manages to conquer a link in the chain.<br/><br/>The game can be played alone versus AI opponents, via network in competitive or cooperative modes and features a progression system where winning matches slowly expands your selection of active abilities.<br/><br/>"}, "160428": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2048671.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Francisco Qui\u00f1ones Aguilera"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Vincent Devault"], "boardgamepublisher": ["RN estudio"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2048671_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Exploration"], "description": "After The End approaches humankind status after a world apocalypse and more specifically, the fight for survival in a hostile environment (Hostile environment=Toxic atmosphere) where everyone wants the same for their people.

The player must either face the consequences, or reap the benefits of these cards, and can use their DAED cards to repel or augment the effect of the WYRD Deck. In addition, players can attempt to raid one another for their DAED cards. Successfully defeating a Monster drawn from the WYRD Deck nets you a Trophy - in the form of some grisly piece of the felled creature - which acts as a counter for your Kingdom's greatness.<br/><br/>All the while, each draw of the WYRD Deck moves Beowulf further along his life path on the game board, with each stop dramatically affecting the stakes of the WYRD Deck.

On their turn, players roll a die to see what threat happens (ship breaks down, asteroids or space slime attacks), then may do one movement and one action; action depending on what station the player is &ndash; an action in the sensor room will increase the sensor system, an action on the bridge will navigate the ship.<br/><br/>All character have different stats in various actions, repairing, and endurance points, that may be used to strain the character for extra actions.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to increase the sensor system enough so that the players manage to navigate out of the dangerous zone. Game is lost if any player dies, if the spaceship collides with an asteroid or if too many space jellyfish cling to the hull.<br/><br/>"}, "160479": {"poll": [], "name": "Pax Galaxia", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Mac Edition", "Windows Edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction", "Space"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Real Time Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Macintosh", "Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>Pax Galaxia is a fast paced strategy game of stellar conquest.

He wanders his now well-worn beat around the jewellery and watch counters considering his predicament. It's a hectic life for the hardened crime fighter when he has to look after lost children taking them to the lost children office in the top left hand corner of the shop. Rushing lost umbrellas and bags to the lost property office ready for their careless owners to fetch, the lost property office is in the top right hand corner of the shop.<br/>At least some variety enters the action when the occasional bungling shop lifter attempts to remove a box off the counter and get away with it. Barney only has to grab the box and return it to the manger's office to prove he was shoplifting, but watch those shoplifters run as you try to grab that box, they hide the box under their coats and you have to keep your eye on him in case he gets mixed up with the other shoppers. The manager resides opposite the main exit in the lower left hand corner of the shop.<br/>There is one time our hero has reason to panic - when the occasional customer drops a parcel bomb in the rows between the counters. The only option left open to him is to grab the bomb and make a run for the double doors at the exit. Of course do something like that and you're well on your way to instant promotion to the next level.<br/>Barney's only aim in life is to be promoted to the next level of play by earning the respect of this manager, of course if that opinion drops below 0% then he will be given a written warning and taken down a level. Three written warnings and you're fired, you can always increase your chances by moving up two levels, the manager will be so pleased he will remove one written warning.<br/>Always keep an eye on the time because at 6 o'clock in the evening it is late night shopping and more customers will appear. You will look forward to 8 o'clock and closing time more than ever but be prepared for the following day and yet more hordes of harrassed housewives.<br/><br/>Credits:<br/><br/>By Eugene Evans<br/><br/>"}, "160490": {"rpgdesigner": ["D.

Through this, Ying Zheng became the first emperor in Chinese history, taking the title of Qin Shi Huang Di.<br/><br/>Plenty of things had to change in order to make the Chinese empire whole, and Qin Shi Huang Di didn't waste any time. He divided the empire into prefectures, personally appointing central and local functionaries; afterward, he decreed that the same writing symbols had to be used throughout the entire nation. Furthermore, he unified the laws and the units of measure, particularly the currency, creating amazing conditions for the economic development and growth of the empire.<br/><br/>Internal decisions were not the only things that shaped this new unified nation. From the North, the menace of the Hsiungnu barbarians kept shaking the empire, and Qin Shi Huang Di knew that the only way to stop that menace was to build one of the most ambitious buildings in human history: The Great Wall of China. Thousands of peasants left their fields to take part in the construction, not only of the Great Wall, but also of roads, channels, palaces, and majestic buildings.<br/><br/>In ZhanGuo, you are the emperor's emissaries, and you have been assigned the challenging task of contributing to the process of unifying the empire, helping to build the wall, and all infrastructures needed. During the five rounds of the game, you must make the best of the few cards you get each round. You can play each card either on your own player board to increase your personal power in the empire, or on the game board to recruit manpower, construct buildings wanted by the emperor, call reinforcements from Qin, and move the armies from kingdom to kingdom.<br/><br/>Each player has to choose the best time and best way to play his cards in order to earn the emperor&rsquo;s favors. Careful, though, because trying to get too much power, or exploiting the workers for personal gain could increase dissatisfaction among the populace, and consequently increase the risk of uprisings in the newly added kingdoms. Whoever is able to make the greatest contribution to the emperor's cause, while at the same time keeping the citizens placid, will be the winner.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "German first edition", "Italian first edition", "Polish first edition"], "average": "7.67741", "name": "ZhanGuo", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Hand Management"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["Brettspiel Adventskalender 2015", "ZhanGuo: Brettspiel Adventskalender 2015 Expansion"], "usersrated": "1827", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Asian Theme", "Country: China"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 007 \u2013 Board Game Terms", "Dukes of Dice - Ep. 33 - Mad Dukes", "Ep. 16 \u2013 UnPub 5 and Roll for the Galaxy | Podcast of Nonsensical Gamers", "EP35\uff1a7 in 1", "Episode 31 - Our Top 20 of All-Time", "Episode 4: Imperial Settlers &amp; Underrated Games", "Episode 67 -- These are the Times You'll Remember When You're Sleeping Under the Bridge", "Episode 83 -- All Ramshackle and Worry Free", "Essen 2014 - ZhanGuo", "Heavy Cardboard Episode 17 \u2013 ZhanGuo", "Low Player Count - Ep 14 - Free Form", "Podcast #080 - Five in Your Face", "The Game Pit - Episode 56 - The Bumper Review of 2015 (with Top 5s)", "WTG11 - The Board Game Leftovers Episode 2 : Great Western Trail, First Class, ZhanGuo, and News!"]}, "160496": {"rpgdesigner": ["Russell Boyd", "Reid San Filippo", "Aldo Regalado", "Simon Washbourne"], "rpgitemversion": ["Limited Alternate Cover OneBookShelf POD Hardcover", "Limited Alternate Cover PDF Version", "PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "SUPERS!

Maybe it's the lights, maybe it's the energy, or maybe it's the giant monsters trying to demolish the place!<br/><br/>King of New York is a standalone game from designer Richard Garfield that keeps the core ideas of King of Tokyo while introducing new ways to play. As in KoT, your goal is to be the first monster to collect 20 victory points (VPs) or to be the last monster standing. On your turn, you roll six dice up to three times, then carry out the actions on those dice. Claws cause damage to other monsters, hearts heal damage to yourself, and energy is stored up so that you can purchase power cards that provide unique effects not available to anyone else.<br/><br/>What's new in King of New York is that you can now try to become a star in the big city; more specifically, you can achieve &quot;Fame&quot;, which nets you VPs, but superstar status is fleeting, so enjoy your time in the spotlight.<br/><br/>The game board for King of New York is larger than in KoT with each monster occupying a district in the city and everyone trying to shine in Manhattan. When you attack, you can displace a monster in another district, whether to escape military forces or to find new smashing opportunities. Yes, smashing because you can now destroy buildings and get bonuses for doing so, but the more destruction you cause, the more intense the military response.<br/><br/>The monsters from King of New York can be used in KoT and vice versa, but the power cards are specific to this game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "French first edition", "German first edition", "Italian first edition", "Polish first edition", "Spanish Devir edition", "Spanish first edition"], "average": "7.19844", "name": "King of New York", "playingtime": "40", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Player Elimination", "Press Your Luck"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["King of New York Promo Cards", "King of New York: 55 Central Park West", "King of New York: Force of Unnature", "King of New York: Hibernation", "King of New York: Improvised Weapons", "King of New York: Monster Idol", "King of New York: Nano Bots", "King of New York: New York City Defender", "King of New York: Power Up!", "King of New York: Sewer Crocs", "King of New York: St. George Theater", "King of New York: Trump Tower", "King of New York: U.N.

It includes 72 tiles, consisting of 63 tiles released in the original base game, 6 from Inns &amp; Cathedrals, 1 from Traders &amp; Builders and 2 from King &amp; Scout. It also includes a special replacement start tile which depicts the Wheel of Fortune, a new mechanic unique to this edition of the game. The new start tile is the size of 16 tiles, arranged in a 4&times;4 square and is built using some of the tiles removed from the base game.<br/><br/>Nineteen tiles from the game have numbers printed on them allowing players to randomly spin the Wheel of Fate (between 1 and 3 spaces around the wheel). Otherwise, a player may choose to place a follower on the wheel if they decline placing a follower that turn. The results of the Wheel vary depending on which of the sixths of the wheel the pig lands on. Results vary from forcing all players to remove a follower from the board to rewarding the player who moves the pig with three bonus points. There are six outcomes in all.<br/><br/>Play of this game does not require ownership of any Carcassonne base game. All expansions are compatible with this game. This game can also be played with the base game as an expansion, using its wagon wheel watermark to differentiate it from the base game.<br/><br/>Bridges, Castles and Bazaars is the eighth expansion for Carcassonne. It allows players three new options while playing:<br/><br/>Bridges may be used to continue a road over a field tile, thereby allowing an incomplete road to technically run into a field segment. They are otherwise treated and scored just like roads.<br/><br/>Castle tokens are placed atop 2-segment cities and allow players a chance to cash-in on the next completed adjacent feature.<br/><br/>Bazaars are a new type of tile that allows players to auction off tiles in exchange for points.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Russian edition"], "name": "\u041a\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u043d: \u041a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0441\u043e \u0444\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0443\u043d\u044b", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Tile Placement"], "average": "7.375", "usersrated": "6", "boardgamefamily": ["Carcassonne"]}}
