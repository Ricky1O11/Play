It has now joined the B-17, B-24 and the Lancaster over the skies of war torn Europe...<br/><br/>B-26: The Marauder Strikes! is a solitaire game set onboard a Martin B-26 Marauder medium bomber during World War Two in the European Theater of Operations from July 1943 until the end of the war in May 1945. It is a big game in that there are many target lists, rules, mission maps and details which are not found in B-17: Queen of the Skies or B-29 Superfortress: Bombers over Japan. For example, the Damage Tables are more detailed than the earlier games and the combat system is similar, but completely new. The Target Lists include a large selection of targets attacked by B-26s from July 1943 until the end of the war in May 1945 and are placed on 13 maps (Movement Boards) which are different depending on where your base is located, from England to the Netherlands. Different models of the B-26 is also included from the early B-26 in 1941 until the B-26G which entered combat in October 1944. The earlier models are not used in the European Theater of Operations (the ETO) in which B-26: The Marauder Strikes! is set, but will be used in 22nd Bomb Group: Marauders from Australia, an add-on variant set in the Pacific in the war against Japan in New Guinea.<br/><br/>Martin B-26 Marauder: The Wingless Wonder was the name of a variant of Avalon Hill's B-17: Queen of the Skies solitaire boardgame. A draft of B-26 was available for play testing which used the B-17: Queen of the Skies rules and B-17 was needed to play. Everything has changed since then, and B-26: The Marauder Strikes! has completely new mechanics and is a stand alone game.<br/><br/>Players familiar with B-17: Queen of the Skies or B-29 Superfortress: Bombers over Japan recognize the mechanics used in B-26. One or more 6-sided dice are rolled on tables to plan the mission, to determine if enemy fighters appear, to hit with machine gun fire and to determine damage and wounds and much more. In some ways it can be quicker to play a mission, but at the same time it can seem to be &ldquo;dice-e-er&rdquo; than its companions. B-26 is, with its advanced and optional guidelines, deep, detailed and complex, but still as easy to play as B-17 or B-29 with its basic system which is similar to the mechanics in B-17 or B-29.<br/><br/>You can begin your campaign flying missions from bases in England or jump in later in the war when the B-26 groups had moved to the continent and you will find Mission Maps with your station either in England, France, Belgium or the Netherlands depending on when you fly your missions.

We haven&rsquo;t even mentioned the terrific full-color character portraits by Tanyaporn Sangsnit, Frank Hessefort, and Colby Stevenson!<br/><br/>Meditations of the Imperial Mystics brings together the sublime secrets of joining mind, body, and spirit with the study of magic as recorded by the revered masters and their fanatical acolytes in ages gone past. Though fragments of their unattainable wisdom have survived in bits and pieces, the true original sources are accounted as great treasures among those who hold them. Rarely have their mysteries been unfolded, but gathered together they wait for you. You will find 18 ki-related feats, from Mindworm and Recenter Flow to Dream Travel and Aura Absolution, as well as 6 new spells, from paradox to steal dying breath. In addition, these tomes contain unique ki training and ability enhancement rules through the study of esoteric texts of the ancient masters, broadening the powers of qinggong while exploring the deeper connections of ki, magic, and mysticism, including supernatural acupuncture, internalization of extreme yin and yang, linkage of mind, spirit, and fate through spirit-auras, and the mortification of the flesh to span the threshold of life and death.<br/><br/>    Body Outside Body, a teak-covered tome whose inscrutable diagrams unfold the mysteries of ki auras and their connections to knowledge, wisdom, fate, and the mind.<br/>    The Instructions of Yin-Blood and Thundering Yang, a unique inverting scroll that read forwards explicates the malleability of cool, yielding yin while read in reverse exposes the eruptive possibilities of fulminant yang, and the proper channeling of each power.<br/>    Prayers of Empty Flesh &amp; Undying Ki, recorded on an infinitely unspooling prayer wheel that draws the mind and soul more deeply the more its chant is intoned, unveils the secrets of straddling the borders of life and death, of making transcendent spirit master base flesh.<br/>    Seven-Ghost-Needles, an academic and clinical treatise on the inner flows of ki through the body and mind and how to focus and channel it through the dantian centers of jin, shen, and wuji.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Road to Destiny. A terrific sandbox adventure for 2nd-level characters! A legacy of death bears bitter fruit in the northern coastlands, as brothers long separated each rise to the call of their darkling heritage. A new destiny has arisen in the west that threatens to shake the foundations of an empire half a world away, but not if Ranulfr the White Wolf and his one-eyed sibling can waylay these would-be heroes on their Road to Destiny! Danger, treachery, and downright skullduggery lie around every turn, and characters will need their wits as well as their weapons if they hope to succeed. This adventure designed for 2nd-level characters offers the chance to earn additional experience during a Far East Adventure Path campaign as the heroes set out on their epic caravan journey to the far side of the world, or it can serve as a self-contained adventure sandbox adventure suitable for any campaign.<br/><br/>Road to Destiny marks the Legacy Games debut of not one but TWO superstar finalists: not only author Jim Groves but also cartographer extraodinaire Pedro Coelho! With fantastic artwork by the talented Jason Juta, Road to Destiny is a 24,000-word epic adventure you will not want to miss regardless of whether you are running the published Adventure Path.<br/><br/>The Baleful Coven. Battling a conspiracy to destroy the future empress before she can realize her imperial destiny, you have overcome all who stood in your way. As you set out to cross the endless cold lands at the top of the world, however, your enemies are not so quick to forgive or forget the dead left in your wake. A mother&rsquo;s love is undying, but so too is her hate. In her eyes, you are murderers, and she will gather dark sisters from far abroad to draw you into a mystic nightmare from which there will be no escape!<br/><br/>This adventure for characters of 6th to 7th level supplements the epic journey through the northern wilds of the Far East Adventure Path campaign. It allows GMs to show the dynamic nature of the campaign world as forces they thought defeated turn out to have allies that do not take the defeat of their kin lightly. While easiest to include as part of the journey through the mountains of the subpolar north as their caravan approaches the arctic, scaling notes suggest methods for leveling up the adventure for use after the arctic crossing as the PCs&rsquo; caravan descends into the Eastern Realms. Apart from an Adventure Path, this adventure can be easily dropped into any campaign to infuse it with an air of malevolent witchery.<br/><br/>The Way of Ki. The power of ki lies latent within all things, flowing through mind, body, and spirit alike and able to be seen and harnessed by those with the focus, devotion, and dedication to master themselves and achieve perfect unity and balance. The game describes ki only in terms of the mystic powers manifested by the monk and ninja, and The Way of Ki contains a wealth of options for increasing the variety and flavor of what these classes can do through their mastery of meditative practice and transcendental contemplation. The power of ki, however, is universal, available to anyone with the focus, desire, and discipline to master it, and The Way of Ki allows characters of every class to unleash this power, adding it to or infusing it within their normal class abilities. Unlock the great mysteries and transcend the natural into the sublime. The game touches on these secrets only briefly, in the context of the mystic powers manifested by the monk and ninja. If ki truly represents the extension of the self into communion with the universe and its hidden flows, however, its secrets should be possible for anyone to master with the proper instruction and dedication. By exploring The Way of Ki, now they can!<br/><br/>You will find 22 general feats, from Composure and Ki Meditation to Sap Ki and Yogic Levitation. For the martially inclined, there are an additional 21 combat feats, including Hadouken, Mighty Kiai, Shattering Strike, and Unyielding Stance. For masters of the mystic arts, there are 16 magical feats including Graceful Calm, Perfected Creation, and Unbounded Conversion. Besides these 59 feats are notes for integrating ki and its use with every class in the game, including vows of discipline and their impact on ki, with special attention paid to expanded options for the the monk, ninja, and samurai.<br/><br/>Under Frozen Stars. On an epic journey across the far frozen wastes, your characters seek their destiny and that of the future empress. Yet at the top of the world, having overcome the ravening storms and dark forces arrayed against them, you discover a marvel of legend, a ruined city both ancient and alien. Surely you cannot simply pass it by without exploring it and seeing what mysteries have lain untouched for time out of mind. Then again, if the rumors told in the caravan are true, perhaps others have come not so long ago, leaving behind a mysterious treasure that may be of great aid in claiming your imperial destiny in the eastern realms.<br/><br/>This adventure for characters of 7th to 9th level supplements (with scaling notes to use the adventure with higher or lower-level adventurers) the epic journey at the midpoint of the Far East Adventure Path campaign. It allows PCs a chance to stop and explore one of the notable locations they discover along the way, helping balance out what can become an arduous grind of seemingly disconnected events on their polar crossing. Apart from an Adventure Path, this adventure serves as an excellent introduction to a desolate lost city hidden by nigh-impassable terrain, yet containing connections to past and future, where east meets west.<br/><br/>"}, "217538": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3443049.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Guillaume Brunier", "Jean-Philippe Caro", "Jacques Exertier", "Jacques Th\u00e9noz"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "10", "boardgameartist": ["Jacques Exertier"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Fantastic Lombric"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3443049_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Medical", "Party Game"], "description": "Congratulation ! you just made a burnout !<br/>You wake up in a psychiatric hospital and doctor said &quot;<br/>No problem, in 30 years you go out&quot;.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to make your imaginary friend guess as many words as possible within 40 seconds.

If destiny is pre-determined, inevitable and unchangeable, is there any hope for we mortals to set our own paths? What of those that seem to be damned by fate, always at the mercy of a higher power? Is there any hope for us at all?<br/><br/>It is rumored that some mortals can choose their own fate by selecting the correct paths as they walk through life.

Soon after birth, they and their families are beset by random misfortune, injury, and loss. Frequently they are abandoned by their communities for being born under an inauspicious sign, or sacrificed to allay curses seemingly brought down by dark Gods. In reality, the birth of these unfortunates was attended by intangible chaos-spirits known as Yla (EE-la). While the Yla are not inherently evil, they are prone to destruction, and ignorant of the pain and misfortune that they cause those whom they bond with. Sages do not know what causes the Yla to seek out an individual, but as of yet, no known spell or prayer can separate them from their chosen. Many afflicted by these spirits live lives of sorrowful destitution, sometimes taking their own lives in misery.<br/><br/>A choice few however, realize that while their affliction cannot be suppressed, it can be commanded. Whether through study or epiphany, these few learn to channel and command the devious spirits that surround them, turning their hardship into a powerful weapon. These few are known collectively as the Malefactori.<br/><br/>In order to preserve their own lives, they willingly bring misfortune and woe to those around them. They are dangerous to their allies and even more so to their adversaries. A Malefactor that has mastered the ability to transfer his own ill fate to others is truly a dangerous opponent...<br/><br/>This sourcebook comes complete with a killer new class and abilities, archetypes, feats, favored class options and the complete stats for the iconic succubus spawned tiefling on the cover -- Talitha Shadowtongue.

But sometimes, it can be fun to take on the mantle of the otherworldly, and to embrace the alien terrors of the cosmos.

Inspired by the legends of the wendigo, the Wind Walker is an unnatural force of corruption, an endlessly-hungering deity of frost and madness. The archetypes in this book build on these themes of hunger, cannibalism, arctic frost, and, of course, the ability to walk the northern winds. This book includes the following archetypes:<br/><br/>    The windwalker bloodline, for bloodragers, that draws power from hunger and from eating the corpses of humanoid creatures.<br/>    The order of the wendigo, a cavalier archetype whose weapons are rimed with frost, and whose mounts gain the ability to walk the northern winds.<br/>    The wendigo kin, a druid archetype that specializes in swallowing her foes alive.<br/>    The arctic channeler, a kineticist archetype with access to several unique snow- and ice-themed talents, and the ability to reduce burn through cannibalism.<br/>    The caller of the north wind, a skald archetype that can conjure arctic gales and absorb the skills of those whose bodies he consumes.<br/>    A bonus cleric domain for those who worship the Wind Walker.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "217656": {"rpgdesigner": ["Nathan Carmen"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Beast Hack 3", "rpgartist": ["Patrick Pullen"], "rpgproducer": ["Nathan Carmen"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3333357.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["The Black Hack"], "rpgpublisher": ["Tricky Troll Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3333357_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The Beast Hack 3 is the third bestiary for Black Hack by Tricky Troll Games!

Players also sail during different seasons of the year and the goods requirement will differ (e.g. one player needs raisins, oranges, nuts, cotton, and tobaco while others need other goods). The types of goods are spread out at different ports and as only half of the requirement for each product can be loaded at the same port, the players will need to visit more than five ports to fulfill their requirements (with some exceptions). The game becomes a task of route optimization to visit the neccessary ports with the least number of dice rolls. Along the way sailors run the risk of encountering storms, price changes on the goods exchange, and random events received via telegram.

This can be done as follows:<br/><br/>1. Players choose one of the four tests and analyze themselves according to the instructions for that test. They check off the results on the appropriate pad sheet.<br/>2. Players initial their pad sheets and pass them to one player who has been selected as reader.<br/>3. Reader shuffles the sheets and reads off, one by one, each player's personality traits. As each sheet is read, ALL players (except the reader) must attempt to guess whose personality traits are being read off.<br/>4. Each correct guess scores one point, and at the end, the player with the highest point count wins.<br/><br/>Introduction to Famous People Games<br/>(Skip some info on separating the cards initially)<br/>On the face of each card are some lines of writing by a famous person. Underneath these lines, in the lower right hand corner, is a series of numbers. These numbers refer to t he personality traits on YOUR PERSONALITY PROFILE pad. They give you an instant analysis of t he writer of the line.<br/>For instance, in the example above, the writing shows traits 9, 17 and 21. Looking at the YOUR RESPONSIBILITY PROFILE pad, you can see that the writer has his head and heart in balance, possesses a dramatic flair, exaggerates and likes to be noticed.<br/>These personality traits are clues to the identity of the person in question. On t he back of each card you will find three famous names. One of them is the writer of the line on the face of the card. Using the personality clues mentioned above - and your intuition - Try to match the lines with their real writer. Answers will be found on page 24.<br/><br/>Famous People Game #1<br/>IN this game, any number of players may compete in identifying the writers of the lines on the front of the Famous People Cards. The Game is played as follows:<br/>1. The deck is shuffled and each player cuts. The player with the highest card (number in the upper left hand corner) deals.<br/>2. Dealer deals one card at a time to center of the table - handwritten lines up.<br/>3. Players have a maximum of one minute to look at the writing and compare the numbers beneath it to the numbered personality traits on their YOUR RESPONSIBILITY PROFILE pad sheets. This gives them some idea of the writer's personality.<br/>4. After one minute, the dealer turns the card over. On the back are the names of three possible writers of the lines on the other side. Players must pick the name of the real writer, using their knowledge of the of the people involved or simple intuition.<br/>5. Players record their answers on a sheet from the FAMOUS PEOPLE GAME pad. As each card is turned over, they write the LETTER (a, b, or c) of the famous person chosen in the box next to the NUMBER of that card.<br/>6. After all 48 cards have been dealt, The dealer reads the answers.<br/>7. Players check off correct answers in appropriate boxes on their FAMOUS PEOPLE GAME pads. Each check scores one point.

to scrape an honest living. But there's always a neighbour&rsquo;s lawn waiting to be mowed.<br/>Fortunately you have inherited your grandfather&rsquo;s MowMaster 2000, in it&rsquo;s day the height of grass removal technology. Unfortunately that day was about 100 years ago and mowing with it now is tricky, due to the machine&rsquo;s somewhat limited functions.<br/>Mind you don't smash it into those trees, because it'll cost you for repairs and watch out for that dog. Above all try to steer clear of the customers' flower beds and prize vegetables as they get very upset at the sight of beheaded daffodils or mashed marrow.<br/><br/>Mower Mania is a mix of puzzle/strategy (working out best routes through the gardens), resource management (your mower functions) and luck (dice for movement and randomness of garden tile layout).<br/><br/>When you land on a long grass tile, you turn it over to reveal it nicely mowed. Landing on vegetables or flowers, however, results in loss of points (money). Land on a pot, or go too fast into a tree or garden feature, and you'll also sustain damage to your mower.<br/><br/>The amount you earn will be based on how much of the lawn you've successfully mowed (a minimum amount required to progress to the next garden) and how much damage you've caused. You'll then need to pay for mower repairs and to replenish mower functions you used.<br/>.<br/><br/>Mower Mania was an entry in the 2016 Mint Tin Design Contest and did exceptionally well:<br/><br/>1st place: Best Overall Design<br/>1st place: Best Theme<br/>2nd place: Best Artwork &amp; Graphic Design<br/>3rd place: Best Written Rules<br/>Top pick: of Guest Judge, Caroline Berg <br/>.<br/><br/>Thanks to all those at BoardgameGeek who played the game, and gave feedback and suggestions, during the contest, especially:<br/>John Kean, lelo Arrowsmith.

In this game, players take the role of an ancient people who are attempting to develop by building monuments and colonizing or founding new cities in the Mediterranean sea.<br/><br/>The game is played in six rounds, each consisting of three phases: preparation, actions, and tidying up. There are three epochs &mdash; rounds 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 &mdash; with new monument cards entering the game at the beginning of rounds 1, 3 and 5. Each player has a personal player map with a time track for action markers and sand timer markers. In the action phase of a round, the players take their turns in clockwise order, conducting one action per turn. Each action requires an action marker from the main board that is placed on the time track. Depending on the information on the action marker, you have to also pay some money or take sand timers that are placed on the time track. When you have no free spaces on your time track, you must pass for the remainder of the round. Therefore, the number of actions per player in a single round may vary significantly if, for example, you choose double sand timers instead of two single ones or take action markers that require more money but fewer sand timers. Single sand timers are dropped in the tidying up phase, while double sand timers are flipped to become single sand timer markers and stay for another round. The actions are:<br/><br/><br/>    Buy new cards from the common display<br/>    Build monuments (playing cards from your hand to your personal display for victory points and new options)<br/>    Educate your people<br/>    Build/found cities<br/>    Take money<br/><br/><br/>To play a card, you must meet the requirements printed on that card, such as having specific persons on your personal board (e.g., two priests and four soldiers). These requirements are why eduction &mdash; i.e., getting specific people &mdash; is important, but that is not that easy because there are six different types of people &mdash; three on the left and three on the right side of your personal player board &mdash; and you have only six spaces in total for the two types in the same line. If you have three merchants, for example, you move your marker for counting merchants three spaces toward the side of the soldiers and thus you have only three spaces left for soldiers. By educating a fourth soldier and moving your soldier marker forward to its fourth space, you automatically lose one merchant because that marker is pushed back to its second space.<br/><br/>It is crucial to generate additional actions by using the specific functions of monuments in your display and cities you have built. Cities are expensive, but they create benefits at the end of each round or provide new options for taking an action without acquiring an action marker, gaining only a sand timer marker instead.<br/><br/>Try to have a steady income to avoid wasting actions to take money. Pay attention to the display of common cards, which is new in every single game, because the monument cards are shuffled randomly within the decks of epochs I, II and III. Collect identical symbols on the cards to benefit from the increasing victory points for a series of symbols. Build cities to enlarge your options!<br/><br/>"}, "217781": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Chandan Mohanty", "Saar Shai", "Sagar Shankar"], "poll": [], "name": "Maha Yodha: Expansion Cards", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Hand Management", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2014", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Weapons & Warriors"], "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Leprechaun Games"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Action / Dexterity", "Expansion for Base-game", "Mythology", "Prehistoric"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Maha Yodha was designed as a fun and quick 2 player game that also features tactical maneuvering and hand management.

You have some connections with national magnates who have a certain extent of influence on both sides. Your future will be bright if you have strong connections with the winning side.<br/><br/>In the game of Tenbin ni Kakero, players secretly vote for one side or two, and when the winning side is determined, a player who has the card with the most influence on that side wins the game.<br/><br/>At beginning of the game, players have several magnate cards and backing cards. Each magnate cards has a different number (1-20) to indicate how much influence that magnate has on which side. Backing cards are either vote card or special cards. Vote cards are numbered 0-3 to indicate vote values, and special cards have a specific power to manipulate votes in play or magnate card in one player's hand.<br/><br/>During your turn, you may place one vote card on one side face down to add some votes, or play one special card for a special effect.<br/><br/>When all backing cards have been played, reveal all vote cards and determine the winning side. The victory goes to the player who has the magnate card with the most influence on the winning side.<br/><br/>Actually, the two sides are not necessarily the republicans and the monarchists. This game has two blank cards so that players may name two sides by their preference, such as pro-Brexit and anti-Brexit, cat person and dog person.<br/><br/>Description from the publisher:'<br/>\u4eca\u3053\u306e\u56fd\u306f\u300c\u541b\u4e3b\u5236\u6d3e\u300d\u3068\u300c\u5171\u548c\u5236\u6d3e\u300d\u306b\u5206\u304b\u308c\u3066\u4e89\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u72b6\u6cc1\u3067\u3059\u3002(\u3053\u308c\u306f\u8aac\u660e\u306e\u70ba\u3067\u3059\u3002\u5b9f\u969b\u306f\u300c\u96e2\u8131\u6d3e\u30fb\u6b8b\u7559\u6d3e\u300d\u300c\u72ac\u6d3e\u30fb\u732b\u6d3e\u300d\u7b49\u3001\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u3082\u306e\u306b\u3057\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044)<br/>\u30fb\u300c\u6709\u529b\u8005\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u300d\u306f1\u301c20\u306e\u6570\u5b57\u304c\u632f\u3063\u3066\u3042\u308a\u30011\u304c\u5171\u548c\u5236\u6d3e\u306e\u6700\u6709\u529b\u8005\u300120\u304c\u541b\u4e3b\u5236\u6d3e\u306e\u6700\u6709\u529b\u8005\u3068\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u30fb\u300c\u5171\u548c\u5236\u6d3e\u300d\u306f1\u306b\u8fd1\u3044\u65b9\u304c\u3088\u308a\u5f37\u529b\u306a\u6709\u529b\u8005\u3067\u3059\u306e\u3067\u3001\u5171\u548c\u5236\u6d3e\u304c\u5b9f\u6a29\u3092\u63e1\u308c\u3070\u300120\u306f\u6700\u5f31\u3068\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u30fb\u300c\u541b\u4e3b\u5236\u6d3e\u300d\u306f20\u306b\u8fd1\u3044\u65b9\u304c\u3088\u308a\u5f37\u529b\u306a\u6709\u529b\u8005\u3067\u3059\u306e\u3067\u3001\u541b\u4e3b\u5236\u6d3e\u304c\u5b9f\u6a29\u3092\u63e1\u308c\u3070\u30011\u306f\u6700\u5f31\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u30fb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u958b\u59cb\u6642\u306b\u914d\u3089\u308c\u305f\u300c\u6709\u529b\u8005\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u300d\u3092\u898b\u3066\u3001\u3069\u3061\u3089\u5074\u306e\u6709\u529b\u8005\u3068\u7e4b\u304c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304b\u3092\u78ba\u8a8d\u3057\u3066\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u30fb\u3069\u3061\u3089\u304b\u306e\u9663\u55b6\u306b\u300c\u6570\u5b57\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u300d\u3092\u88cf\u5411\u304d\u3067\u7f6e\u304f\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3001\u305d\u306e\u9663\u55b6\u3092\u652f\u63f4\uff08\u6295\u7968\u3057\u305f\u3068\u8003\u3048\u308b\u3068\u5206\u304b\u308a\u3084\u3059\u3044\u304b\u3082\u77e5\u308c\u307e\u305b\u3093\uff09\u3092\u3057\u3066\u3044\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u30fb\u5168\u54e1\u306e\u3059\u3079\u3066\u306e\u624b\u672d\u304c\u306a\u304f\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3089\u3001\u300c\u6570\u5b57\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u300d\u3092\u96c6\u8a08\u3057\u3066\u5408\u8a08\u304c\u591a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u9663\u55b6\u304c\u5b9f\u6a29\u3092\u63e1\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u30fb\u300c\u5b9f\u6a29\u3092\u63e1\u3063\u305f\u5074\u306e\u6709\u529b\u8005\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u300d\u3067\u6700\u3082\u6709\u529b\u306a\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u6301\u3064\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u304c\u52dd\u5229\u3067\u3059\u3002<br/>\u30fb\u4f8b\u3048\u3070\u300c\u541b\u4e3b\u5236\u6d3e\u300d\u304c\u5b9f\u6a29\u3092\u63e1\u3063\u305f\u5834\u5408\u306f\u300120\u306b\u8fd1\u3044\u6709\u529b\u8005\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u52dd\u5229\u3068\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u30fb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u5909\u5316\u3092\u6301\u305f\u305b\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u3001\u300c\u30ea\u30e0\u30fc\u30d6\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u300d\u3068\u300c\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30ea\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\uff08\u978d\u66ff\u3048\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\uff09\u300d\u304c\u7528\u610f\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/><br/>"}, "217799": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Siberia (\u30b7\u30d9\u30ea\u30a2)"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Hikari to Yami to (\u5149\u3068\u95c7\u3068)", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Memory"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "7", "boardgameartist": ["Siberia (\u30b7\u30d9\u30ea\u30a2)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Siberia (\u30b7\u30d9\u30ea\u30a2)"], "boardgameversion": ["Japanese first edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Deduction", "Memory", "Party Game"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "User summary<br/>\u5149\u3068\u95c7\u3068 (Hikari to Yami to) in English is 'Light &amp; Darkness'.<br/><br/>In the game of Hikari to Yami to, players play cards to score points, and the highest scorer wins the game.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, players have the same number of cards.

Actually, all of them are on a diet so they don't want to eat too much. That's why they began to foist fattening cakes to one another!<br/><br/>Each player initially has three cake cards. Each turn, you pass a card from your hand to any other player. If it causes that player to have a pair of the same cake, that player has eaten the cake and takes the calories written on the card.<br/><br/>Some cards are special. They can make you or another player gain or lose calories. When you draw such a card, follow the instruction written on it.<br/><br/>At the end of each turn, players with fewer than three cards must fill their hand up to three cards. If that causes a pair, more calories are added as well.<br/><br/>When the draw pile runs out, the player with the lowest calories eaten wins the game.<br/><br/>The game is packaged like a cake, 10cm round and 4cm deep.<br/><br/>Description from the publisher:<br/>\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306f\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u98df\u3079\u653e\u984c\u306e\u5e97\u306b\u3084\u3063\u3066\u304d\u305f\u5973\u5b50\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u5168\u54e1\u3053\u3063\u305d\u308a\u30c0\u30a4\u30a8\u30c3\u30c8\u4e2d\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3001\u3042\u307e\u308a\u30ab\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u6442\u53d6\u3057\u305f\u304f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002<br/>\u624b\u672d\uff08\u76bf\uff09\u306b\u3042\u308b\u9ad8\u30ab\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306b\u62bc\u3057\u4ed8\u3051\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002<br/>\u540c\u3058\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u4e8c\u679a\u63c3\u3063\u305f\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306f\u305d\u308c\u3092\u98df\u3079\u305f\u3053\u3068\u306b\u306a\u308a\u3001\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u5834\u306b\u51fa\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u5c71\u672d\u304c\u306a\u304f\u306a\u3063\u305f\u6642\u70b9\u3067\u4e00\u756a\u6442\u53d6\u30ab\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u4f4e\u3044\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u304c\u52dd\u8005\u3067\u3059\u3002<br/><br/>"}, "217842": {"rpgartist": ["Hanns Bolz"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "poll": [], "name": "Classic Dungeon Design Guide", "rpgdesigner": ["Kent David Kelly"], "rpgproducer": ["Kent David Kelly"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3336392.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["Kindle version", "PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Wonderland Imprints"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Castle Oldskull Fantasy Role-Playing Supplement"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3336392_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Deep dwarven cities of the underworld,<br/>Infested by conquering orcs,<br/>Enslaved by demons of skull and pyre ...<br/>Black labyrinths of mad demigods,<br/>Proving grounds for daring adventurers<br/>And graveyards for greedy fools ...<br/>Twisting passages, all alike,<br/>Where lurking trolls and shadow beasts<br/>Guard the deepest riddles of the nether ...<br/><br/>If you have ever wanted to know how to quickly and masterfully create your own mega-dungeon for your pen-and-paper Fantasy Role-Playing Game (PNP FRPG) campaigns, this is the perfect book for you.

Players create characters using the core D&amp;D rules and the guidelines in this document, and can then play those characters in any LFR adventure, anywhere in the world. As you play adventures, your character earns experience points, gold, and magic items which stay with you from game to game. There are dozens of new adventures to play each year!<br/><br/>The Living Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide explains how to create and advance characters. This document also contains various rules needed to support the shared-world and organized-play aspects of the game. In a Living Campaign, characters grow and develop over time through many adventures.

The rule book credits Douglas Lawson for having &quot;correlated&quot; the Babcock rules with card play.<br/><br/>The 164-card deck replicates the mix of tiles in the classic game. It includes four cards for 1-9 for each of the three suits (Dots, Bamboo, Characters), as well as four each of the North, South, East and West winds and Red, Green and White Dragons, plus the 8 Flower cards. As in the classic rules, players try to collect sets or 3 or 4 of a kind or in a sequence, with bonuses for various combinations and special tiles.<br/><br/>Instead of ivory or bone scoring sticks, the card game uses thin colored wooden rods for scoring. The game includes 40 short green sticks worth 2 each, 32 medium-length yellow sticks worth 10, 36 longer red sticks worth 100, and 8 long blue sticks worth 500.<br/><br/>While the rule book focuses on the Standard and Royal games for four players, it does include variant rules for 3, 5 and 6 players. (The Babcock rules were largely superceded in North America in the 1930s by American Mah-Jongg rules.)<br/><br/>"}, "217894": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3415864.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Richard Launius", "Pete Shirey"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2017", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Gong Studios", "Scott Hartman"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Indie Boards & Cards"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3415864_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Exploration", "Fantasy"], "description": "Brave Delvers from across the realm have journeyed to seek their fortune within the dungeons of Skull Cavern.

War becomes unavoidable. <br/><br/>The Prussian army concentrates on Erf&uuml;rt without waiting for the troops of its Russian ally. Outrunning his opponents, Napoleon enters Saxony with the Grand Army on October 7, 1806 and heads for Berlin.<br/><br/>A week later the Prussians, defeated at Jena and Auerstaedt, retreat North. The pursuit led by the Murat cavalry can begin... <br/><br/>When the game meets history:<br/><br/>Napoleon 1806 is a game at the crossroads of history and simulation.<br/> Napoleon 1806 is the culmination of two history and wargame enthusiasts, Denis Sauvage and Julien Busson, who wished to share this passion with you. <br/>With Napoleon 1806, in 1 to 2 hours, two players will relive the clashes between Prussian and French at the heart of the imperial conquests of Napoleon the 1st, which culminated in the battles of Auerstaedt and Jena.<br/><br/>Napoleon 1806 is intended for wargaming seasoned grognards as well as for young conscripts who want to try a new playful sensation. Strategy, anticipation and decision are the engines of the Napoleon 1806 game system.<br/><br/>The rules of Napoleon 1806 are divided into three parts and can be learnt in fifteen minutes. The first one, called &quot;Rules of the Conscript&quot;, allows to acquire all the notions of the game easily. The second, &quot;Rules of the Grognard&quot;, brings more finesse including &quot;fog of war&quot;. The last, &quot;Rules of the Marshal&quot;, allows to play Napoleon 1806 in competition.<br/><br/>Will you meet the challenge of doing as well as the Emperor Napoleon or will you succeed in thwarting his plans at the head of the Prussian forces?<br/><br/>How to play Napoleon 1806:<br/><br/>A game of Napoleon 1806 is played in 7 turns, each representing two days of campaign. Players alternate operations with their army corps. Fatigue and losses accumulate until the breaking point of one of the two armies causing the defeat of a player.<br/><br/>The game is based on cards to perform moves and combats. Even if luck is present, strategy is key to victory. Moving your army corps on different approach paths to facilitate maneuvers, managing the fatigue of your men generated by marching and fighting, concentrating your forces in order to win the decisive battle; these are the challenges you will face.<br/><br/>The French troops are more numerous and more experienced than those of their opponent, but time is short before the arrival of the Russian reinforcements, and the Prussian army is not to be underestimated! The French player to win will have to master the art of attacking and speed of action. The Prussian player, although defensive, will have to seize the opportunities presented to him to counter-attack and surprise his opponent. As the game is fast, each player will have the opportunity to take charge of the fate of both armies in one evening.<br/><br/>"}, "217935": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Reader Contribution)", "Mark Somers"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "rpgseries": ["Living Greyhawk Regional Gazetteers"], "name": "Krestible City", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3339658.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Greyhawk"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3339658_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>Krestible City &ndash; Where mountain meets plain.

Although there are deductive elements, the game is a social interaction experience that encourages shameless table talk, bluffing, and deal-making as players seek to maximize their end game scores.<br/><br/>Each player has a virtuoso card that designates their human prot&eacute;g&eacute; and a hand of doubt and dread cards.  Each turn, the player draws two doubt cards for their hand, places a doubt or dread card from their hand onto a virtuoso card, then discards a card from their hand. In some cases, a player may play two doubt cards from their hand, but this action permanently reduces their hand size. Each virtuoso has an ability that their muse may use, such as change a dread to a doubt or move a doubt from one virtuoso to another.  Scheming, negotiating, and table talk are encouraged!<br/><br/>When a virtuoso is saddled with a combined total of five doubt and/or dread cards, the virtuoso is driven insane. An insane virtuoso still gets their turn and may still win the game, but their options for which cards they may play on their turn is limited by their insanity.

You control your Faction&rsquo;s space program, outposts, and fleets spanning across the solar system, although you will also have some influence over your Faction&rsquo;s politics back home on Earth as space development becomes more important.<br/><br/>Gameplay is reminiscent of Master of Orion, Civilization, and other 4X games (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate). Movement is based on real physics: you&rsquo;ll move from orbit to orbit, or conduct long range transfers to move between planetary systems like Earth, Mars, or Jupiter. As you send out robotic explorers and crewed vehicles to explore the solar system, they&rsquo;ll bring back valuable data to further your scientific research. Technologies are intended to represent plausible extrapolations of existing development during the next 150 years: there are no transporters or warp drive, but you will be able to develop rockets powered by fusion and even anti-matter. In the engineering and biology domains, you&rsquo;ll eventually be able to construct space elevators and put your crews into safe hibernation for long journeys.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll design your own ships using over 50 different component types based on your level of technology on the tech tree. There range from tiny probes intended to merely take photographs as you fly past Jupiter, to giant destroyers, cruisers, and battleships which ply the space lanes with peaceful or hostile intentions. The policies you choose will determine your focus (robotic, crewed, economic, diplomatic, settlement, or military), allowing you to draw new ship and base components you'll use to design and construct your ships and bases. These range from ship components like engine rooms, medical bays, airlocks, and command centers, or weapons and defenses like lasers, rail guns, and stealth systems, to base facilities like mining stations, research labs, or spaceports.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll be given a budget to spend on Earth and can also build bases to harvest minerals, organics, and fuel to expands your economy. You can also forge diplomatic relationships with players and non-player factions alike, and trade resources at their bases to earn extra cash. Each of the seven factions (North America, South America, Europe, Russia, Japan, China, and Asia) has different strengths, weaknesses, abilities, and available ships based on their unique geopolitical situation. Military conflict is certainly possible but not always encouraged. Stellar Horizon features more diplomatic, technological, and economic competition than outright combat, although neglecting warships entirely leaves you vulnerable to pirates, trade embargoes, and sneak attacks by rogue players and factions.<br/><br/>Stellar Horizon includes short co-operative and competitive scenarios lasting an hour or more, and campaigns lasting a day up to about a full weekend for experienced players. Up to seven players can play at a time and the game is most fun with at least 2, but there are also 1-player scenarios, and the campaigns are highly suited for solo play. There are three ways to win the campaign: be the first to develop an Interstellar Colonizer, terraform a world, or achieve dominance in space over your rivals.<br/><br/>"}, "217991": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["MASHED: A Korean War MASH RPG"], "statistics": [], "name": "MASHED: A Korean War MASH RPG", "rpgdesigner": ["Mark Plemmons"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3344948.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["History", "Modern", "War"], "rpgpublisher": ["Brabblemark Press"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3344948_t.jpg", "description": "(publisher blurb)<br/><br/>MASHED is a tabletop roleplaying game that uses Powered by the Apocalypse rules to explore the value of human life and the stresses of war&mdash;but it&rsquo;s also about relationships.

Much of the game actually occurs outside of the operating tent, at times when the flow of casualties has ebbed. Here you may fall in or out of love, fight the orders of ineffective top brass, set up pranks, help your South Korean allies, pick fights, seduce your way through the unit, pull rank, and much more.<br/><br/>If you can find ways to relax amid the horrors of surgery and war, you might get rotated home with your sanity intact.
