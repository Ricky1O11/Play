Besides the cubes, Mists of War also gives the players a secret objective to win the game. Furthermore, a player receives a number of force points unknown to the other player which he can spend on buying troops. The more force points you get, the harder your objective will be.<br/>Activation of units is done by selecting zones.

Only if you master all the challenges will you be a true master thief.<br/><br/>Playing the game<br/>In CleptoMania, every player is a thief. You can play on your own or in a team. The cards are laid face down on the table, are then mixed and arranged. The complete array of cards represents the scene of a crime. One player takes the first turn and flips over 2 cards. If two cards are turned over that are the same, something is activated, acquired, opened or the turn ends, depending on the cards. If two different cards are turned over (the exceptions are the alarm and the handcuffs), both cards are placed face down again and the turn ends. Once a player has finished his or her turn, the police, who are on the game board, move one space closer to the thief or the team. Then it is then next player's turn moving clockwise. If all the treasure and lock cards have been taken and the scene of the crime abandoned before the police have caught the thief or the team, the raid has been successful.<br/><br/>"}, "200724": {"average": "5.125", "poll": [], "name": "I Hate Zombies: Spyke and Geek", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "yearpublished": "2016", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3029593_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Robb Mommaerts"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Steve Jackson Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3029593.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "I Hate Zombies: Spyke and Geek are two promotional cards for the I Hate Zombies base game.<br/><br/>&bull; Spyke &mdash; which depicts the familiar Munchkin face &mdash; allows a player to throw both hands during play, resolving the right hand normally and dealing one wound to a zombie card if the left hand ties.<br/><br/>&bull; Geek &mdash; which depicts the BGG mascot Ernie &mdash; lets a player throw tentacles, which beats rock and scissors while losing to paper.<br/><br/>"}, "200725": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Nicholas Markgraf"], "poll": [], "name": "Court of Kings", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Simulation", "Voting"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "5", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3056603_t.jpg", "average": "5.8", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["PawnJoker Games"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The First Roll - What's New on Kickstarter? - Episode 69: Tuesday, September 27th"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3056603.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Medieval", "Negotiation", "Political"], "age": "13", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "The King has fallen!

One to four may play, with special rules at the end for one and two-player games. Each player portrays a hero from legend who undertakes quests to battle with fierce monsters and retrieve epic artifacts.<br/><br/>Each player controls the actions of one Hero selected at the start of the game. Hero counters are moved on the map along from Sites to linked Points, Points to linked Points, and Points to linked Sites. A Hero's Ally, if she has one, and Crew remaining sit aboard the Hero's Ship and lend their skills to the Hero as needed.<br/><br/>Heroes, Allies, and Crew have three attributes: Battle, Navigation, and Wits. During the game, players must make die rolls against the combined attributes of their respective Hero, Ally, and Crew. Monsters and other game effects can kill Crew. A Hero begins with six Crew. Players record the current number of Crew by placing the Crew marker on the corresponding shield number. As a player's Crew are killed by monsters and other game effects, the owning player moves the marker to a shield with the appropriate lower number.<br/><br/>A Hero with no remaining Crew is essentially alone on a raft. Her crew is dead or has run off. If a Hero's Crew counter is on the &quot;0&quot; Shield on her Ship mat, the Hero may not add the Crew's skill numbers, and may only take one Action each turn. Also, when a Hero's Crew reaches the &quot;0&quot; Shield, she loses any Gear or Ally counters she had. Turn those counters face down and shuffle them back into their respective piles.<br/><br/>In the fashion of good mythology, BoT relies on a generous amount of Prophesy. The amount of Prophesy collected by a Hero is represented by a track on her Ship. A player may have no more than six Prophesy points at any time. Prophesy has two primary uses. A player may spend a Prophesy point during her turn to look at all counters at any Site on the map. This is important so a player can know what sort of challenge she faces on her next Quest or what a particular Sea Monster is. A player may dedicate Prophesy markers to provide bonus die rolls, if needed, during a Challenge. Each Prophesy committed allows the player to roll an additional die during the Challenge roll. Any Prophesy committed are lost at the end of the Challenge, whether used or not. Neither of these uses costs the player an Action.<br/><br/>Each player begins the game with a randomly drawn Quest Marker. The first player to gain a third Completed Quest wins the game!<br/><br/>"}, "200750": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3088474.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Rapha\u00ebl Guiton", "Jean-Baptiste Lullien", "Nicolas Raoult"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "6", "age": "10", "boardgamepublisher": ["CMON Limited", "Guillotine Games"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3088474_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Horror", "Medieval", "Miniatures", "Zombies"], "description": "Zombicide: Black Plague &ndash; Huntsman Pack contains all the Kickstarter exclusive stretch goals received by those who backed the Zombicide: Black Plague funding project at Huntsman or Knight-level.<br/><br/>This pack contains:<br/><br/>     the Dice bag<br/>     custom Black Dice<br/>     12 N.P.C. miniatures and white counter bases<br/>     extra Zombie miniatures (5 Walkers, 4 Runners, 4 Fatties, 3 Wolfz, 1 Necromancer, 1 Abomination, 1 Wolf-bomination)<br/>     2 special Necromancers and 12 Spawn cards for special Necromancers<br/>     Metal First Player Coin<br/>     Survivor miniatures and ID Cards<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Included 17 Survivors with ID Cards:<br/><br/>     Lucas<br/>     James<br/>     Hitch<br/>     Mortimer<br/>     William<br/>     Danton<br/>     Troy<br/>     Evil Troy<br/>     Falstaff<br/>     Montalban<br/>     Xuxa<br/>     Morgan<br/>     Paul<br/>     Bob<br/>     Lady Faye<br/>     Gilbert<br/>     Piper<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Included special Necromancers:<br/><br/>     Queen Medea<br/>     Necro card for Evil Troy<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Kickstarter exclusive edition"], "name": "Zombicide: Black Plague \u2013 Huntsman Pack", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Modular Board"], "average": "8.21438", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "153", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Zombicide"]}, "200751": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3088471.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Rapha\u00ebl Guiton", "Jean-Baptiste Lullien", "Nicolas Raoult"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Jason Hendricks", "Adrian Smith"], "boardgamepublisher": ["CMON Limited", "Guillotine Games"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3088471_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Horror", "Medieval", "Miniatures", "Zombies"], "description": "Zombicide: Black Plague &ndash; Knight Pack contains all the Kickstarter exclusive stretch goals received by those who backed the Zombicide: Black Plague funding project at Knight-level.

It employs a [Game Master] and players. It uses an interesting and relatively unusual resolution system&mdash;but not a unique one. In actual play, it will occasionally look and feel quite similar to a session of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. With one key exception. The game focuses on the importance of faith. In most role-playing games, character &ldquo;death&rdquo; is literal, where the character is retired because he is, say, slain in a battle with a great beast. In Home Sweet Home, a character is retired when&mdash;and only when&mdash;he loses his faith. Characters don&rsquo;t have hit points or some analog; they have a measure of faith that can rise or deplete as circumstances dictate. This subtle distinction can have a profound impact on play. Things that cause great concern in most role-playing games might become trivial. Conversely, a simple off-hand comment might have grave implications. By shifting the focus of character survival from the physical to the spiritual, a unique game experience results. Interestingly, this phenomenon is highlighted by the otherwise similar structure of play. The dissonance highlights the distinction.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>This exceptional game presents a well-developed and internally consistent setting that supports the game focus on the characters' internal belief system.  Character Attributes - Scripture, Creed, etc. - focus on character belief.  Opposed action resolution uses opposed (small) dice pools with the highest non-tie result determining the winner.  Each player should have one distinctive die (which plays a special role).<br/><br/>"}, "200771": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3038637.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Monopoly"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["John Elliot (II)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Todd Scalise"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Diogenes Games LTD."], "boardgameintegration": ["Monopoly", "Monopoly"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3038637_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Fan Expansion"], "description": "Way back during the depths of the Great Depression in 1934, patriotic American and underemployed heater salesman Charles B.

As players explore the map and open doors, additional quest rules, tiles, tokens, and monsters are revealed.<br/><br/>&bull; Instead of resolving all hero turns followed by all monster activations, hero turns and monster activations alternate.

With a broad range of critters for every habitat, the book has plot hooks that show how critters may be used in campaigns, details on new critter powers, and other information to flesh out Shadowrun adventures and campaigns.

As the game progresses, your Champions will have the opportunity to acquire new items which will enhance their capabilities as well as perhaps give them even more skills to use to defeat your enemy.<br/><br/>Glyph utilizes an intriguing dice-building and card-drafting mechanic, which rewards tactical thought as well as provides exciting gameplay. The dice in the game represent ancient powers, which each color of dice having a unique face structure tailored to specific Glyphs. Each Glyph serves a specific purpose and, through rolling and manipulating the dice, your Champions will be able to perform actions ranging from devastating attacks, to fortified defensive stances, to supportive aid. Each Champion also has various item slots available and you will be able to acquire unique weapons and armor to aid you in combat. Some items are rather simple and provide minor boosts to your champion's dice pool, while others have their own unique abilities that only the wearer of the item can perform.<br/><br/>These items come at a cost, however: you may be required to spend [read: trash] dice from your own champion's pool in order to acquire these powerful items. This makes item acquisition much more than merely taking an available card--you will need to weigh the costs and benefits of these items and determine if sacrificing the requisite dice is worth it.<br/><br/>The decisions you make each round will have a lasting influence on the tide of battle. Do you take advantage of a weakened Champion and attack or try to accumulate wealth to purchase a suit of armor to protect you in subsequent rounds?

The game is organized in five phases. The phases proceed backwards along the drug&rsquo;s route: starting with treatment then addiction, sale, enforcement and ending with production. The treatment phase of the game frames the others. Play starts with players taking the role of patients in a group treatment facility. Through monologues and improvised scenes, players reveal memories of how cocaine impacted their characters&rsquo; lives. In between these group therapy scenes, the game shifts to the other stages. Each of these phases opens with an improv game by which players quickly establish situations related to the theme of the phase. Then players play the situations further and resolve them through mini poker games. Throughout the game, players are collecting coins when they improv and then wagering the money during the card games. After all five phases of the game are finished, the amount of money each player has determines whether their character was successfully cured of their cocaine addiction.<br/><br/>"}, "200829": {"rpgdesigner": ["Michael Booker", "Alex Burchell", "Roger Daggs", "Doug Dudley", "David Dunham", "David W.

To do so, the players help to build the Grand Canal of China and to construct the Forbidden City. The player who avoids riots and insurrections and who can prove their skill in developing the canal system to the Grand Coordinator has the best chances to win.<br/><br/>In Da Yunhe: Der Grosse Kaiserkanal, the players are Chinese canal inspectors in the year 1400 who are responsible for developing the canal system in the northern Chinese territory. In the first phase of a turn, the players draft action cards in order to use these in the second phase. The action cards have three actions, which all can be used partially or in whole, and in any possible playing order. The players can always get new tiles, and they have the option to build canal tiles on the board or in the Forbidden City. The players can use riot tiles against competitors to damage their competitor's reputation at Court. The building of canals is rewarded with an instant gain of reputation. The building in the Forbidden City allows a leap forward at the end of the game in the final count.<br/><br/>In the third phase of each turn, the Great Coordinator inspects the development of the Grand Canal and grants additional points if it is possible to travel along the canal. If he steps on riot tiles, the player responsible for the territory with the riot loses reputation. In phase four, riot tiles that had been removed from the board might lead to an insurrection, with the player(s) responsible suffering a loss of reputation. In the fifth phase of the turn, the players return the used action cards and exchange the starting player marker, then the new starting player (clockwise from the next player) begins the next turn.<br/><br/>The players play as many turns necessary to allow the Great Coordinator four journeys along the Great Canal. The players gain reputation at Court by building canals and the Forbidden City and successful inspections by the Great Coordinator and lose reputation through insurrections and hostile actions of other players.

The deck consists of 90 cards, numbered 1-30 in three colors. Cards 1-15 have up arrows while 16-30 have down arrows, and the most recent card played dictates whether the next card must be higher or lower. If you have more than one card of the same number, you can play them together. If you can't play a card, you draw a card, then play it if possible.<br/><br/>The rules for Same One! include four variants, and you can use one or more of them as you choose. In the simplest, you can't go out with a shark card (i.e. #13-18) on your final turn. Another variant requires that you match the color of the card last played, with sets of more than one number allowing you to change the required color.<br/><br/>Another variant has you playing multiple rounds and tracking the points won or lost by each player. When someone goes out, each other player loses as many points as the number of cards still in their hand while the one who went out gains points equal to the sum of points lost that round. If a player goes out with a 1 (the dog), then each player loses 10 points and that player wins 10 points per opponent.<br/><br/>With the final variant, if you have a number in hand that matches the number most recently played, you can play that card out of turn.

On a turn, a player takes the tile to their left, right or front; moves their figure to the space just vacated; then draws a tile to place where their figure started the turn.<br/><br/>When adding an animal tile in your park, you add its main landscape &mdash; the base space for the animal &mdash; to your park, too. While placing this new animal, its own piece of landscape can help to fulfill the requirements of your other animals' requirements, e.g., the water on a hippo tile fulfilling the adjacent otter's need for water. Thus, fulfilling every animal's desire for land becomes a more and more difficult task with each tile you add.<br/><br/>Aside from expanding your park with different landscape types, flora and animals, you can improve its profitability by building extra entrance roads, trek spots, and watchtowers.<br/><br/>Habitats lasts three seasons, with each season giving each player 6-9 new tiles for their parks.

Each player plays a wizard that specializes in creating magic items. These wizards cater to rich adventurers looking to trade their hard-won spoils for magical gear to make themselves more powerful. Each wizard owns a magic shop in which they display the fruits of their labor for gold-laden adventurers to come in and purchase. However, the adventurers' funds are finite. The wizards are competing to make their shops the most famous so that the adventurers will stop there first. And the best way to make a shop famous is to have the most impressive selection of useful and powerful magical gear. Whichever player's store obtains the most Prestige (victory points) will attract the customers and make the sales. May the craftiest wizard win!<br/><br/>Manaforge is played over nine rounds. At the beginning of each round, six cards representing the items that can be created that round are placed on the center board. Each player rolls their own handful of dice, the symbols on which represent the types of mana that they have to spend this round. Then in player order, each player spends that mana to construct one of the items in the center, taking its card and adding it to their collection. Some cards have an instantaneous effect and are then discarded, while other cards stay in play and grant the player benefits such as additional mana each turn or the ability to turn mana into Prestige. Beware, though: time is short! Each player may create only one item each round, so a player can only ever get nine cards in total.<br/><br/>A game of Manaforge takes an hour on average, depending on the number of players and their level of skill.

On the other side, Italy and Germany are sending more and more troops to North Africa under constant threat from aircraft in Malta and facing the imminent entry of the United States into the war.<br/><br/>In this original card game, the cards represent units that took part in naval engagements or fought near convoys in the Mediterranean during the Second World War. For each trick called engagement, a player takes an Operation card (Battle or Convoy) and declares the type of attack to be used (air, surface, underwater or combined). He follows that up by playing a Force card which has the specific values representing a historical Allied or Axis unit. The other players subsequently play either a Force card or pass. When all the players have made their selections, and any possible dice rolls have been made, totals of both sides are compared to determine whether the Axis or the Allies won. The player who contributed the most to the winning team gets to decide how the convoy and the opposing enemy ships, which are all worth victory points and possibly an increased hand size, are to be distributed amongst the players who were on the winning side. After twenty-two convoys have been fought over in this manner, the player with the most victory points worth of convoys and captured ships wins the game!<br/><br/>Med Sirocco is a strategy card game for 2-6 players.

I want a world in which Varg Vikernes and David Hill can both make and sell games and I can ignore both of them.<br/><br/>That said, I cannot help but be drawn to controversial topics &ndash; that is where the interesting conflicts and stories lie - and there are few topics so controversial as the treatment of 'minorities' within media. Here we arrive at a nexus-point between realism, expectation, demands for representation, demands for free expression, historical revisionism, magic, science fiction, truth, 'is' and 'ought'. That makes it interesting, but the battle lines of identarian politics, liberalism, conservatism, the regressive left and cultural libertarianism also make it an area fraught with difficulty and wilful misunderstanding.<br/><br/>There are no good &ndash; or at least no satisfactory &ndash; answers to a lot of these questions. Perhaps there are just multiple approaches each of which will annoy some group or other. What's true in all circumstances however is that these controversial topics are interesting, fascinating and important in terms of world, character and scenario building whatever your particular stance.<br/><br/>This booklet intends to examine these issues in and of themselves, outside of the current state of controversy and to ask &ndash; rather - how we might better simulate the plight of minority groups, understand them within the context of fictional worlds, make allowances for player-characters who might seek to buck those societal trends or allow characters &ndash; through their actions &ndash; to affect social change within the game worlds.<br/><br/>"}, "200959": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3100555.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Stephen Pole"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Alberto Cavazzuti"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Europa Simulazioni"], "boardgameintegration": ["The Invasion of Russia (1812)", "The Invasion of Russia (1812)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3100555_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Napoleonic", "Wargame"], "description": "It is February 1813. The defeated remnants of the once invincible Grande Arm&eacute;e have arrived back in the West. Despite the catastrophe in Russia, all is not lost for Napoleon.<br/><br/>On the European mainland, only Russia is openly at war with France. In theory, the other powers, Austria, Prussia and the German States, still remain allies. Can the Emperor recruit a new army and secure sufficient military success to persuade his allies to stand firm; or bolstered by the Russian advance, will they turn against the French? &ldquo;1813: Napoleon&rsquo;s Nemesis&rdquo; simulates this fascinating campaign which determined the shape of nineteenth-century Europe.  \ufeff<br/><br/>The Game (designed by Steve Pole)<br/><br/>1813: Napoleon&rsquo;s Nemesis&rdquo; is strategic in scope. Combat units represent all the divisions (categorised as veterans, line or conscripts) which took part to the campaign, together with the most important commanders. The game presents strategic options corresponding to those available to Napoleon and the Coalition forces, and replicates the consequences which flow from each. At the same time, it captures the essence of campaign warfare during this period &ndash; sweeping manoeuvres, feints and deceptions, forced marches, and the greater flexibility and cohesion of seasoned troops &ndash; as well as the crucial matter of logistics. The Basic Rules are simple and can be learnt very quickly minimising the amount of time players need to spend consulting the Rulebook. Optional Rules and Advanced Rules (including cards) add even more realism and sense of period. <br/>   <br/>The &ldquo;1813: Napoleon&rsquo;s Nemesis&rdquo; is the second volume of a projected series of games at the same scale (the first being &quot;The Invasion of Russia (1812)&quot;), covering all the major campaign of the Napoleonic Wars at a strategic level.\ufeff<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "240", "name": "1813: Napoleon's Nemesis", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "7.42812", "usersrated": "16", "age": "0"}, "200960": {"rpgartist": ["Maxime Beaulac", "Claytonian", "Reid San Filippo", "Matt Jordan", "Todd McGowan", "Brad Morris", "Naam", "Frank Turfler, Jr.", "James Yoder"], "statistics": [], "name": "Crawling Under a Broken Moon (Collection 1)", "rpgdesigner": ["Sean Ellis", "Reid San Filippo", "Ryan Moore"], "rpgproducer": ["Jason Bossert", "Reid San Filippo"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3037956.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Crawling Under A Broken Moon"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Cirque de Bizarre", "Crawling Under a Broken Moon", "Credits", "An Interesting Place to Die", "An Interesting Place to Die", "Open Game License v1.0a", "Radioactive Wasters", "Table of Contents", "The Earth Brain of the Cyberhive", "The Mall Maul", "The Mighty Kizz - The Intergalactic God of Rock and Roll", "The Mutant", "The Technologist", "Theszolokomodra - the 1000-Headed Multi-Dimensional Hydra", "Twisted Menagerie", "Twisted Menagerie", "Twisted Menagerie", "Weapons of the Wastelands", "Weapons of the Wastelands", "Welcome to Umerica"], "rpg": ["Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game"], "rpgpublisher": ["Shield of Faith Studios"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF Version", "POD Version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3037956_t.jpg", "description": "This contains the first four issues of the Crawling Under a Broken Moon zine collected into one volume.<br/><br/>Perfect-bound paperback.<br/><br/>"}, "200961": {"poll": [], "name": "Prehistoric Tales", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Business/Construction"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Amegami"], "videogamegenre": ["Management"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Alawar Entertainment"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>By a twist of fate, you turn out to be the chief of a small tribe of islanders invaded by neighbors.<br/><br/>"}, "200962": {"poll": [], "name": "Hybrid Animals", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Animals"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamefranchise": ["(Unreleased Games - Available)"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Abstract Software Inc."], "description": "<br/><br/><br/>    <br/>        <br/>UNRELEASED GAME &ndash; AVAILABLE<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        <br/>This game is still either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between) but IS already available for sale / early access, so CAN BE PLAYED.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>Pick 2 animals from a list and the game will use an algorithm to morph them together!

In general, only writers engaged in poetry about and for their own deaths. In Japan, though, such poems were often writ&shy;ten by samurai, monks, nobility, writers, poets, and even sometimes by farmers who&rsquo;d had some formal training in reading and writing. These poems differed a lot from the typical rhyming couplets or quatrains of English writers, as the poems from Western tradition often tended to be silly humor or other such doggerel.<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s not the goal here. Here I&rsquo;d like for people to write a somewhat serious poem, ideally a haiku or tanka, from the point of view of someone who is going to die and knows it. Haiku in English has been often been taught as a nature poem of three lines alternating as five syllables, seven syllables, and five syllables. Not only is that not really the case (haiku in Japan are often written in one vertical line), but it has done such a dis&shy;service to the form of haiku that poets who work in the form are often overlooked.<br/><br/>I hope to help people produce better haiku through this game, and to at least come to an understanding that writers should be respectful to the haiku form. Along with that desire, the game is also an attempt at pushing people into the arms of poetry by maybe trying to write something they haven&rsquo;t before. So many people say they don&rsquo;t like or don&rsquo;t understand poems. It&rsquo;s my sincere hope that this helps break that block.<br/><br/>"}, "200987": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3035598.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ben Hull"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Knut Gr\u00fcnitz", "Charles Kibler", "Rodger B.

A rare breed of human that has the ability to slip through time at will. But this ability does not come without a cost. Your kind has drawn the interest of an untouchable crime boss known only as Gary. He wishes to not only control the city, but the city today, tomorrow, and yesterday. That&rsquo;s where you come in; an indentured servant, forced into a life of non-linear crime. You can&rsquo;t claim to dislike the rewards of your efforts, but the risks involved have you looking for an exit strategy - a normal life. Not to seem unreasonable, Gary has proposed a game; he is willing to release one of his loyal Shifters upon completion of one last job.<br/><br/>You assume the role of one of four Shifters; your job is to fulfill Contracts for your boss, Gary. Contract cards outline a cargo, such as a certain quantity of contraband or an amount of credits that must be delivered to a certain year. Upon fulfilling the Contract requirements, you will receive a reward to help you on your mission.  Each turn you move your pawn forward one month, naturally, within the confines of the nine year timeline of Gary&rsquo;s competition. If you land on a month circled in red, you may choose an additional Contract from those available. Roll the month die to determine if you encounter Gary; will he reward your hard work or punish your incompetence?<br/><br/>Next, you choose one of two options.  You may choose to perform any number of actions, including buying and selling guns, drugs, technology, and stocks, depositing to or withdrawing credits from the bank, fulfilling Contracts, or utilizing Subterfuge cards. Use Subterfuge cards to give you one time advantages, such as extra moves, bonus resources, or to sabotage an opponent. Or, you may choose to shift forward or backward one entire year to take advantage of varying levels of supply and demand or to reach a Contract delivery date. However, when you Shift, you must draw an Event card. Event cards can change the level of Technological Innovation, alter the value of Contraband, or manipulate at time&rsquo;s Financial Health.<br/><br/>There are two types of Contracts: standard and release.

There is a yacht club in one corner of the 24.5 x 19 inch map, and the courses are complicated by three islands and four banks of shoals.<br/><br/>While the basic mechanic is simple (roll two dice), the rules and subtleties do a good job of recreating the tensions of a sailboat race. A red die determines the basic movement amount, but this is modified by matching the red-white combination against a Help and Hindrance card that evens out the results. Net moves range from 0 (6-6=blown out a sail) to 5. Lower red rolls get help and higher ones get penalized.<br/><br/>Unlike later games, the wind is assumed to blow constantly from the top of the board, and courses are laid out accordingly. The rules and realities of sailing apply: a boat on starboard tack has right of way over port; close-hauled over reaching or running; getting to windward of another boat hurts its movement, and so on.<br/><br/>There are rules for tacking, luffing and setting spinnakers. There are shoals that players can try to get over but if their turn ends on a shoal they ground. There is an advanced start process too: instead of rolling for position with highest first, players can spend three turns manoeuvering for position as in a real race.<br/><br/>The rulebook has extensive diagrams of various potential situations, and is designed to make the game instructive as well as fun for players who are not sailors.<br/><br/>"}, "200998": {"boardgamedesigner": ["P.

All of you should discuss who will be an attacker who gets rid of cards, and who will be a healer who draws cards and keeps away from apocalypse.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>\u5354\u529b\u578b\u306e\u30a6\u30ce\u3067\u3059\u3002\u8ab0\u304b\uff11\u4eba\u3067\u3082\u624b\u672d\u3092\u51fa\u3057\u304d\u308c\u3070\u5168\u54e1\u306e\u52dd\u5229\u3068\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u624b\u672d\u306e\u51fa\u3057\u65b9\u306e\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u306f\u30a6\u30ce\u3068\u540c\u3058\u3067\u3001\u76f4\u524d\u306b\u51fa\u3057\u305f\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u8272\u304b\u6570\u5b57\u304c\u540c\u3058\u306a\u3089\u51fa\u305b\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u51fa\u3059\u305f\u3073\u306b\u30c0\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u304c\u6e9c\u307e\u3063\u3066\u3044\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\u6642\u306b\u306f\u30c0\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u56de\u5fa9\u3059\u3079\u304f\u3001\u3042\u3048\u3066\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u5f15\u304f\u5fc5\u8981\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002\u8ab0\u3092\u30a2\u30bf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\uff08\u624b\u672d\u3092\u51fa\u3057\u5207\u308b\u5f79\uff09\u306b\u3057\u3001\u8ab0\u3092\u30d2\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\uff08\u9650\u754c\u307e\u3067\u624b\u672d\u3092\u6e9c\u3081\u3066\u30c0\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u56de\u5fa9\u3055\u305b\u308b\u5f79\uff09\u306b\u3059\u308b\u306e\u304b\u76f8\u8ac7\u3057\u306a\u304c\u3089\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u9032\u3081\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002<br/><br/>"}, "200530": {"boardgamedesigner": ["E.

To do this, they will need to hire specialized pilots. There are many pilots to hire, each possessing a unique special ability. Pilots are also specialized in what ships they are trained to use. Hiring the right pilot for a ship reduces that pilot's cost. The more ships a pilot is specialized in, the weaker their special ability is. Pilots are hired by spending unused dice that correspond with the four different ship types, and are worth victory points during play. Pilots are shuffled into a deck and splayed out like planets.<br/><br/>Additionally, Tiny Epic Galaxies: Beyond the Black introduces a press-your-luck exploration option for players. This allows players to venture beyond the planets and into deep space where they might encounter dwarf planets worth victory points, or rare materials that yield resources... or they may encounter cosmic threats like solar storms, black holes, and even supernovas. Either way, exploring deep space provides a player with exploration badges. These badges are tallied up at the end of the game and players are rewarded bonus victory points based on who has the most of a certain badge type.

You are supposed to assume the role of the militant feudal and to put a halt to the hostile lords&rsquo; encroachments on the throne of the fairy kingdom. Mercenaries will help you: they are ready to spill their blood on the battlefield for a pretty penny and promises of glory.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Royal Defense&rdquo; vaguely resembles &ldquo;Battles of magicians&rdquo; and &ldquo;Memoir&rsquo;44&rdquo;. Lords&rsquo; castles are located on both sides of the game-board. Players can recruit troops and build fortifications there. The battlefield itself is two-sided and it contains special structures, giving bonuses to players who occupy these locations.<br/><br/>Before starting the game, each player chooses one of the four mercenary factions, which will be his army. Characters of each faction are represented by the cards. They have their own  particularities, strengths and weaknesses. A lot of soldiers have not only ordinary characteristics such as velocity, attack and defence, but also some special abilities (which are very often unique for the army) that can be used during the game.<br/><br/>The confrontation between barons is very swift. Having recruited troops from hand, a player can move forward and attack. As soldiers can move only forward, so five &ldquo;corridors&rdquo; appear on the battlefield where the major battles occur. But each player can activate only five units during his or her turn, and some characters can change the lines they move along. All these points transform simple mechanics into an interesting tactical puzzle. The more the player is experienced, the more difficult is to solve this puzzle. Moreover, spells, able to change course of action, are available for each player. Soldiers also can be sent to the Catacombs in the hope of finding treasures hidden there.<br/><br/>There are two ways to win: to help your mercenaries to end up beyond the edge of your adversary&rsquo;s field or to get 20 points for having struck adversary&rsquo;s troops and having destroyed his structures.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Royal Defense&rdquo; is a duel strategy game with low learning curve. Its rules are easy to explain and the game will not take long. Besides, rules also propose different options for three and four players.<br/><br/>"}, "200550": {"rpgartist": ["Alberto Bontempi", "Alan D'Amico", "Simone Delladio", "Elisa Ferrotto", "Fabio Gorla", "Yugin Maffioli", "Andrea Tentori Montalto", "Federico Musetti", "Matteo Spirito"], "rpgitemversion": ["Hardcover Vers"], "statistics": [], "name": "Sine Requie Anno XIII: Tomo dei Morti Volume II", "rpgdesigner": ["Matteo Cortini", "Leonardo Moretti"], "rpgproducer": ["Massimo Bianchini", "Luca Cattini", "Andrea Gualdi"], "rpg": ["Sine Requie Anno XIII"], "usersrated": "0", "rpggenre": ["Horror"], "rpgpublisher": ["Asterion Press"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "average": "0", "description": "From the back of the book:<br/> Queste pagine raccolgono segreti e testimonianze sui pi&ugrave; terribili orrori partoriti dal Giorno del Giudizio: i Morti.<br/><br/>English translation:<br/> These pages collect intelligence and evidence on the most terrible horrors born from the Day of Judgment: the Dead.<br/> "}, "200551": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3026865.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Julian Anstey"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": ["Julian Anstey"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3026865_t.png", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Print & Play", "Trains"], "boardgamehonor": ["2016 Golden Geek Best Print & Play Board Game Nominee"], "description": "A pencil and paper game of building railway networks for one or more players.<br/><br/>30 Rails is played on a 6 x 6 grid of squares.

Set in Queensland, the book details the adventures of Digit Dick , a &quot;little boy only as big as his mother's big toe&quot;, who smuggles himself on holiday with his parents in his father's coat pocket.<br/><br/>The game is a simple roll-and-move race game using marbles as pawns on a board mounted in the game box. The track is a connected sequence of 45 holes. Most holes are small enough to hold the marble in place, but 9 of the holes are large enough to swallow the marble (and represent the adventures Dick has in the book).<br/><br/>Players must throw 1 or 6 on a six-sided die to being, then get to roll again for a proper move. If the player's marble lands on a big hole, it rolls down the box and he must start again.

Regardless of their specialty, all Martial Artists use rigorous mental and physical discipline to push their bodies and minds past the normal limits.<br/>    <br/>    A new point-based martial arts maneuvers system. Martial artists gain maneuvers which enhance their attacks or skills as they advance in level. Other classes can learn maneuvers as well through feats.<br/>    Three new races: the multi-armed insectoid Kecheck, the blind Uhr, and the monsterous Vokt. <br/>    Two new skills (Focus and Psitech) and several new feats.<br/>    Three prestige classes (Alliance Psiwarrior, Kecheck Blademaster, Uhr Ascetic, and Vokt Guardian).<br/>    New psionic technology items.<br/>    Suggestions for using the system with other 3.X/Pathfinder games.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "200636": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jason Nelson"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Intrigue Magic Feats", "rpgartist": ["Tanya Sangsnit"], "rpgproducer": ["Jason Nelson"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3028268.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "7", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Legendary Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Mythic Minis"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3028268_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Intrigue Magic Feats is the latest Mythic Mini devoted to exploring the subtle arts of intrigue, from spies and saboteurs to heists, chases, mysteries, secret identities, and the fine art of conversation.

Using grid-based movement over two different realms, Schism utilises an action-point system giving players access to a range of moves, options and abilities each turn, but decisions must be made carefully as some actions will cost you your life force and energy; lose too much and you may find yourself banished to one world or the next, edging you ever closer to the end of your existence.

Some of them care for us, watch over us and protect us, while others corrupt, kill and manipulate. We assume they have always been here, but now they are making it known. The world as we know it has been changed forever. &lsquo;Angels&rsquo; are revealing themselves, gathering followers and building an army of believers to defend against the threats that emerge from the darkness. &lsquo;Daemons&rsquo; are stealing souls, building rank after rank of damned warriors, preparing to ravage and consume one realm or the next. These beings have begun tearing each other limb from limb, wielding weapons of fire &amp; light, spreading their wings and exerting otherworldly powers. So, which way will you turn?

After the second location has been removed, the game ends.
