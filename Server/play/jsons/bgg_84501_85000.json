Though it is based on the movie in terms of plotline and additional dialogue, the game was different from the movie. The NES port uses sound effects from the early 1990's Simpsons games; Bart vs. the Space Mutants for example.<br/><br/>Certain changes made the game more interesting in an interactive game than in a static movie, such as use of different weapons and power-ups for protection, level layouts with enemies not seen in the movie, and for the Uncle's House level, usage of hidden keys and locked doors gained only after luring Marv or Harry into specific traps laid out in the various rooms (aka the first two Home Alone movies), as well as an active scene involving the Bird Woman and her birdseed attacks.<br/><br/>The Super NES version, while boasting a soundtrack with the Super NES traditionally realistic sounding instrument synth, suffered due to slightly post-8-bit graphics and sound effects, as well as a disjointed feel of incontinuity between stages.<br/><br/>The NES version has four different levels, the first of which is the Plaza Hotel. Kevin races through various floors and rooms collecting power-ups and avoiding the hotel staff, crazy guests and runaway vacuum cleaners and suitcases. Before he can escape, however, he has to deal with two bosses: the ever-persistent House Detective and the Master Chef. The next level takes place in Central Park, and is similar to the Plaza Hotel: Kevin collects his goodies while avoiding rats, bats and assorted thugs.<br/><br/>The third level takes place in Kevin's uncle's three-story Townhouse. This time Kevin has to avoid Harry and Marv, and sets up several booby-traps to keep the Wet, er, Sticky Bandits at bay. While doing so, Kevin must also find keys that will allow him to escape to the next floor, and ultimately the Rooftop. Once he's on the roof, Kevin escapes to the streets of New York with the Bandits hot on his tail, until he reaches the giant Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center. It's here where he gets help from the Pigeon Lady to defeat Harry and Marv, have them sent to jail, and finally reunites with his family.<br/><br/>Reception<br/><br/>The game has had very low critical reception. Most reviewers complain that various elements of the game change depending on what part of a level the player is on; for example, the slide attack is an effective move on one part of the level, but does not work on another.<br/><br/>Home Alone 2: Lost in New York was awarded Worst Sequel of 1992 by Electronic Gaming Monthly.

Skating challenges are marked on a mini-map, along with stores and subway stations that allow the player to traverse the city quickly. As the player develops their skills and performs various tasks (such as completing certain tricks while being filmed), sponsorship and notability are acquired, eventually leading to participation in the X Games. &quot;Filming&quot; challenges allow the player to create a line of tricks to meet the filming goals; the player may also place a session marker to return to a spot quickly after finishing a line. Several &quot;own the spot&quot; locations throughout the city allow the player to try to claim that spot by beating a certain score requirement, thus &quot;owning&quot; the spot from other skaters. Additionally, there are jam sessions and &quot;death races&quot; against other AI-controlled characters. Completing challenges will generally unlock new clothing and equipment items, characters, and additional challenges to compete in.

It basically popped into my head one night when I was trying to work on a magic system for Alternacy. This was back in April, 1998, and I had the basics of the system written up within about a month. A couple of helpful members of the Alternacy Update Mailing List provided some feedback over the summer and the current edition was written and revised during September, October, and November.<br/><br/>While I suppose there are shades of Mnemonic that can be detected in Alternacy, it is a significantly different type of roleplaying game. It's basically my attempt to create the fastest, lightest rules I possibly could while still retaining a useful, not-too-grainy system. Very little rules awareness is required of players; while there's a system present, it strives for transparency. It&rsquo;s an odd goal, but I also wanted to create a game that could be played while one was on a road trip. I don&rsquo;t really take that many road trips anymore, but that&rsquo;s still the benchmark that got stuck in my mind and wouldn&rsquo;t leave. I believe I succeeded.<br/><br/>There are three fundamental points about Mnemonic that should help you decide if it&rsquo;s the type of game for you:<br/><br/><br/>    It&rsquo;s Simple. Mnemonic falls into the &ldquo;minimalist&rdquo; rpg camp. It&rsquo;s built to provide basic ratings of character traits, a means for referees to determine the difficulty and outcome of attempted actions, and a very general system for tracking health and vitality. That&rsquo;s about it. This means the rules don&rsquo;t get in the way of play, but they also can&rsquo;t provide much detail or ambience.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    It&rsquo;s Portable. Mnemonic is designed to be playable while traveling, sitting at lunch, or even stranded on the proverbial desert island. It can be played with little or no equipment while still retaining the random element of diced gaming. I'm hoping this will also make it highly suitable for online gaming.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    It Can Be Memorized. The rules contain mnemonic devices that allow players and refs to memorize everything necessary for play. Once you learn them you&rsquo;ll have a complete (though simple) roleplaying game in your head.<br/><br/><br/>Like Alternacy, Mnemonic is a universal system. You can use it for play in any type of setting, and suggestions are included for handling everything from warships to dragons with the same rules.<br/><br/>"}, "84616": {"rpgdesigner": ["Nicholas Bongiu", "Shawn Carman", "Christopher Fuchs", "Scott Hadsall", "Nick Jones", "Russel \"Rusty\" Priske", "Bryan Reese", "Todd Rowland"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Imperial Herald (Volume 3, Issue 5 - September 2010)", "rpgartist": ["Mike Capprotti", "Conceptopolis", "Andrew Hepworth", "David Horne", "jim pinto", "Florian Stitz"], "rpgproducer": ["Scott Hadsall", "Dave Lepore"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic876011.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["The Imperial Herald"], "rpgissuearticle": ["A Closer Look at Empire at War", "Enemies of the Empire", "Gencon Environment", "Hero of the Pass", "An Interview With Todd Rowland", "Megagame Update", "Not Competitive?

Originally located on a GeoCities website, it was introduced in late July/early August of 1997. Updated versions were produced the following October and February. The files available for download now are basically identical to the February version of 1999.<br/><br/>I&rsquo;ve come to think of my work on Alternacy as an attempt to solve a number of problems I&rsquo;d encountered in other games. My basic goal was a game containing a detailed method of quantifying character traits married to a flexible means of handling action resolution. I wanted a comprehensive skill list that was still flexible and reasonably brief, thus Techniques and Custom Skills were born. My desire for a detailed assessment of character attributes led to a whopping sixteen Talents. The system for determining the advance and decline of skills, both at character creation and during play, allows for a wide variety of skill levels tied directly to character activity and ability rather than a standard experience/character point approach. The dice mechanic provides centralized results more often than extreme highs and lows, and the ref&rsquo;s tools for rating the difficulty of attempted actions is based on perceived challenge, allowing for varying power levels unique to each referee. In a sense, Alternacy is my attempt to refine and advance upon the accomplishments of traditional gaming.<br/><br/>In my view, Alternacy is a moderately complex game. Character creation and advancement both require a fair bit of time and effort, but actual play moves rather quickly. It&rsquo;s a universal system, meaning it can be used to play in any genre or setting. As already mentioned, it strives to give players a detailed assessment of their character&rsquo;s abilities, but leaves the details of game events to the discretion of referees. It includes some steps towards a rules-light approach, but I think I&rsquo;d still classify it as a more or less conventional system.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if I'll be doing any more work on Alternacy or if it's current form represents the final version. I'd like to adjust the wound system as it seems more cumbersome than I'd like, and I've thought about going through and cleaning up the writing, hunting a few typos and making things more clear. I'd still like to make a magic system for it, and have toyed with multi-game magic tools that would be suitable. I haven't worked on it for ages, though, so it's probably complete, or at least very close. At any rate it is certainly playable as is.<br/><br/>"}, "84618": {"poll": [], "name": "70 80", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Acting", "Line Drawing", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Singing"], "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Decades: 70's", "Decades: 80's"], "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic850637_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Bontus"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic850637.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Party Game", "Trivia"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Description from publisher:<br/><br/>Un juego &quot;pip&iacute; cuc&uacute;&quot; para revivir lo m&aacute;s divertido de la &eacute;poca.<br/><br/>En este juego, los setentosos y ochentosos, tienen que contestar  preguntas, actuar, dibujar, silbar y mucho m&aacute;s...recordando lo m&aacute;s <br/>divertido de la &eacute;poca.<br/><br/>&iquest;Te anim&aacute;s a actuar representando al &quot;Super agente 86&quot; y dibujar un balero...o al Correcaminos; y a silbar &quot;Menta y Lim&oacute;n&quot;... o &quot;Cleopatra&quot;?<br/><br/><br/>Is a mix between Trivial Pursuit, Pictionary and acting, everything based on the music, tv, movies and culture of the 70s and 80s.

A few areas grow rapidly, having discovered new substances and scientific elements. Technology thrives with many new concepts including cyber technology, hover propulsion, new medicines, weaponry, space research and even some new types of energy.<br/><br/>On the other hand 80% of the planet remains torn apart from the Holocaust.

The oceans still have huge bodies of water being reduced only 5%, but have been polluted beyond recoverable status. This is not to say that life cannot flourish within the oceans. Some species have adapted very well to the waters strange effects but most cannot survive for an extended period of time. Therefore the life cycles have dramatically increased. As for human involvement, many large underwater Aqua Stations have been built and a few underwater cities have been established.<br/><br/>Day to day, people in general live their lives as expected. Either starving on the streets or thriving off of another's downfall. Crime rates are through the roof while law enforcement is becoming more erratic with every day that passes. Lethal drugs and disease&rsquo;s spread through communities faster than government corruption but most cities have local hospitals with the proper vaccines readily available, considering that if you still have a wallet or you can make it to the hospital in the first place.<br/><br/>Transportation consists of hover vehicles and many salvaged pre-holocaust vehicles, at least in the cities. While in the wastelands areas, walking is most common. A few wasteland exceptions drive modified pre-holocaust vehicles, dune-buggies, motorcycles etc....<br/><br/>Another great advancement is space research. With all the new technology coming about scientists have discovered new means of propulsion and agricultural growth. This has allowed for many explorations of the Moon, which eventually lead to the colonization of the Moon&rsquo;s surface. Only a few hundred thousand live there but the Moon colony is quite vast, hosting some of mankind&rsquo;s greatest inventions and minds. The moon is accessible to most seeking off world life but the price of getting there is outrageous for any newcomers. This limits the expansion of the colony to a few hundred a year.

And to make the games played with them as enjoyable as is possible. Because of this things such as gunnery have been simplified as much as possible.<br/><br/>&quot;Ships gunnery at the time of the Armada was a thing in a state of flux. It is as well to contemplate, that ships carried many different types of ordinance, all intermingled together on the same deck. The logistics of serving such a varied armament in a rapid manner was beyond the capabilities of the time, and I would hazard a guess beyond us today as well. Most authorities give a maximum rate of fire for the guns of the Spaniards as once, yes once, a day. Small pieces and hand held weapons were obviously much quicker to reload. Even the English rate of fire is said to have been at best once an hour.

Originally a game for two, three or four players, it's mostly known today in an adapted version for two players brought into England by the Mathematics professor A.S. Besikovitch, and later included in David Parlett's Oxford Guide to Card Games. This version is played with exposed cards and symmetrical hands, giving it a strong strategic flavour.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the (Besikovitch) game each player chooses two sets without overlapping with the other player, typically in a 32-card deck, out of which one is their own trump. Cards are dealt for the first player, who keeps the cards of their both sets; the second player gets exactly the same cards in the other sets and both their hands are filled up with the rest of the cards. As an example: a player who's chosen spades and clubs with spades as trumps keeps the cards in both sets and gives all their red cards together with the undealt cards to the other player, who then selects the analog cards to the first player's in the red sets with hearts as trumps, gives the rest of the red cards back to the first player and finally keeps all the remaining black cards. Both hands are symmetrical, and play can start.<br/><br/>From now on each turn a player lays a card in a pile between both players; before the next player can play out a card of their choice they must throw one that is superior in value to the top card in the pile or a trump. If the player can't or doesn't want to do so they must take the whole pile and forfeit the turn. So, each player throws two cards in a row: one following the previous card, and one to be followed by the opponent. The first player to get rid of all cards in their hand is the winner.<br/><br/>"}, "84631": {"poll": [], "name": "Rise of the Robots", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Arcade edition", "EN/EU Amiga CD32 edition", "EN/EU Amiga edition", "EN/EU CD-I edition", "EN/EU DOS 3.5\" Disk edition", "EN/EU DOS CD edition", "EN/EU Genesis edition", "EN/EU SNES edition", "JPN Super Famicom edition", "US 3DO edition", "US DOS CD edition", "US GameGear edition", "US Genesis edition", "US SNES edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1353276.png", "videogameseries": ["Rise of the Robots"], "videogametheme": ["Cyberpunk", "Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "14", "videogamedeveloper": ["Data Design Interactive Ltd.", "Mirage Interactive LLC"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["3DO", "Amiga", "Arcade", "CD-i", "DOS", "SEGA Game Gear", "SEGA Genesis", "SNES"], "average": "3.75", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Unknown)", "Absolute Entertainment", "Acclaim Entertainment Inc.", "Philips Interactive Media, Inc.", "T&E Soft", "Time-Warner Interactive"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1353276_t.png", "description": "From the back of the box (DOS):<br/><br/>Metropolis 4.

Many modern kung-fu movies trace their origins to Wuxia. The heroes are usually independent, living as wanderers or rebels, following a code of honor to protect innocents from oppression. Most are martial-arts masters and some have quasi-mystical powers. Supernatural beings and evil sorcerers are present in many Wuxia stories. In short, these are the Eastern equivalent of swords &amp; sorcery or the picaresque novel.<br/><br/>Traditional Wuxia focuses on common people of great skill, following the warrior's code to defend helpless innocents from evil overlords, crime bosses, vile sorcerers, and unnatural monsters. Often, a tangled soap-opera-like web of enemies, allies, and departed lovers envelops the hero, pulling him or her into adventure from multiple angles. A recurring theme in Wuxia is the conflict between love (or other personal relationships and goals) and duty (acting honorably and for the cause of good), so select Hindrances that play into these contradictory motivations.<br/><br/>The rules presented here provide a modern, cinematic kung-fu experience.

It was released for the MSX computer, the Family Computer Disk System, the Nintendo Entertainment System, and for the Virtual Console. It was reworked for the MSX2 computer as Zanac Ex and for the PlayStation as Zanac X Zanac. Players fly a lone starfighter, dubbed the AFX-6502 Zanac, through twelve levels; their goal is to destroy the System a part-organic, part-mechanical entity bent on destroying Mankind.<br/><br/>Zanac was developed by main core developers of Compile, including Masamitsu &quot;Moo&quot; Niitani, &quot;Janus&quot; Teramoto, and &quot;Jemini&quot; Hirono. All of these developers went on to make other popular similarly-based games such as The Guardian Legend, Blazing Lazers, and the Puyo Puyo series. The game is known for its intense and fast-paced gameplay, level of difficulty, and music which seems to match the pace of the game. It has been praised for its unique adaptive artificial intelligence, in which the game automatically adjusts the difficulty level according to the player's skill level and rate of fire.<br/><br/>History<br/><br/>Zanac was initially released in 1986 for the MSX computer by the Japanese video game company Compile the same company responsible for other games such as Blazing Lazers, Devil's Crush, and the Puyo Puyo series. Compile then re-released the game for the MSX2 computer later that same year as Zanac Ex, which featured improved graphics and sound over the original MSX version. Zanac was then ported and heavily reworked again for release on the Family Computer Disk System in Japan on November 28, 1986 (1986-11-28), and then in North America for the NES in October 1987. The NES version was later re-released for Wii's Virtual Console service on December 3, 2007 (2007-12-03) and published by D4 Enterprise. This version is identical to the NES version released in 1987.<br/><br/>Compile released a compilation titled Zanac X Zanac for Sony's PlayStation console in Japan on November 29, 2001 (2001-11-29) to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the original. This compilation features an updated version of Zanac titled Zanac Neo and three versions of the NES version of the game, including a version featuring enhanced graphics and sound. The game features two-player cooperative gameplay as well as a remix of the game's soundtrack.<br/><br/>Zanac, in retrospect, has been considered a unique shoot 'em up game, combining gameplay elements from games such as Xevious, especially with the extensive power-up system and vertical-scrolling gameplay that features both air and ground targets. Brett Alan Weiss of Allgame praised Zanac, calling it an extremely fast-paced shooter in which the player is almost completely surrounded by enemy ships and bullets. He praises the game for its music which seems to flow along with the action of the game; he calls the music &quot;at least as close as you can get to a Zen moment while playing a shooting game on the NES&quot;. Frank Provo of GameSpot lauded Zanac for its difficulty level, its ability to handle many sprites on the screen without slowdown or other glitches, and its unique AI, which placed this game in a sub-genre of its own. However, criticisms include mediocre and primitive music and sound, a steep learning curve in gameplay and difficulty level, and, most notably, presence of Engrish in the game itself and in the game's instruction manual. In addition, Weiss says that enemies in Zanac, while fearsome, &quot;don't have much personality.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Zanac&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "84698": {"rpgartist": ["Storn Cook"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version 2.0"], "statistics": [], "name": "Savage Westeros", "rpgdesigner": ["Markus Finster"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic980292.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": ["Westeros"], "average": "5", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpg": ["Savage Worlds"], "rpgcategory": ["Alternate Rules (Variant Core Rules)", "Campaign Setting (game world)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic980292_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary: <br/>Web-published conversion of the Game of Thrones setting to the Savage Worlds! rpg.<br/><br/>From the notes: You will need the Savage Worlds (Revised Second Edition) Rulebook as well as the Fantasy Gear Toolkit and Fantasy World Builder Toolkit to make full use of this free download.<br/><br/>"}, "84699": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Savage Weird War II", "rpgdesigner": ["Lenny Zimmermann"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic979321.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": ["Weird Wars"], "average": "6", "rpggenre": ["History (Alternative)", "Horror (Supernatural)", "War"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpg": ["Savage Worlds"], "rpgcategory": ["Alternate Rules (Variant Core Rules)", "Campaign Setting (game world)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic979321_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/>Welcome to my conversion notes for Pinnacle Entertainment Group Inc.&rsquo;s Weird War II: Blood on the Rhine (WWII:BotR).

Released by Nintendo in late 1996 in Japan and North America, and 1997 in Europe, it features ten buttons, one digital (not analog) control stick and a directional pad, all laid out in a &quot;M&quot; shape.<br/><br/>Design<br/><br/>The controller for the Nintendo 64 was designed to be held in several different positions. It was designed around Super Mario 64. It could be held by the two outer grips, allowing use of the digital D-pad, right-hand face buttons and the &quot;L&quot; and &quot;R&quot; shoulder buttons (but not the &quot;Z&quot; trigger or analog stick). It could be also held by the center and right-hand grip, allowing the use of the single control stick, the right hand-buttons, the &quot;R&quot; shoulder button, and the &quot;Z&quot; trigger on the rear (but not the &quot;L&quot; shoulder button or D-pad). More often than not the analog stick was used in games while in some, both the control stick and directional pad could be interchangeable (ex: Mortal Kombat Trilogy). Very few games used the directional pad exclusively; two examples are the 3D puzzle game Tetrisphere and the side-scrolling platformer Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards.<br/><br/>The controller also included four &quot;C buttons&quot;, which were originally intended to control the camera in the N64's three dimensional environments. However, since the pad only contained three other face buttons, the C-buttons often became assigned to ulterior functions. An example of this is The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, where the C-buttons can be assigned to secondary items and the &quot;Z&quot;-trigger is used to orient the camera.<br/><br/>European controllers have a special Ferrite core about 4 centimeters from the connector plug, to prevent the user from being shocked by the power being supplied to it by the system if the wires become exposed. It also acts as cable tensioner.<br/><br/>One game, Robotron 64, allowed one player to use two controllers to control an avatar. This way the game played like its predecessor, Robotron 2084. Star Wars Episode 1: Racer, GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark also used this set up for slightly different gameplay experiences (in terms of control, at least) compared to the standard single controller option.<br/><br/>The controller initially came in six colors (grey, black, red, green, yellow and blue) but other colors were released later, many of them coinciding with the release of a similarly color or designed system. Some of these others include: smoke black, watermelon red, jungle green, fire orange, ice blue, grape purple, and special edition colors like gold, atomic purple, extreme green, &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; banana bunch yellow, &quot;Pok&eacute;mon&quot; blue/yellow and &quot;Millenium 2000&quot; platinum.<br/><br/>Analog stick<br/><br/>For many years, console designers and manufacturers ignored analog stick technology, instead preferring the digital D-pad. It was not until the emergence of 3D gameplay that the analog stick was put into widespread use.[citation needed] Using a D-pad in a 3D game greatly limits the players ability to accurately utilize 360&deg; of motion. Some early 3D games like Resident Evil overcame this limitation by assigning the Left and Right directions on the D-pad to spin the character rather than make the character move in that direction.<br/><br/>However, with the prevalence of analog sticks, the aforementioned D-pad limitation was no longer an issue. Though the Nintendo 64 wasn't the first console to use an analog stick (the Vectrex was first), it did popularize the idea. Its release followed Sega's analog Mission Stick for Sega Saturn as well as Sony's Analog Joystick and was followed during the fifth generation by Sony's Dual Analog and Dual Shock controllers for the PlayStation system as well as Sega's 3D control pad for their Saturn system and the analog controller for their Dreamcast system.<br/><br/>The analog stick was prone to some long-term reliability issues. If used excessively, the stick became &quot;loose&quot;, which means it will not fully return to center position, which may render gameplay more difficult by giving unintended, non-user input to the system. This loosening can be caused by rotating it intensively - a common practice in games like Mario Party where it offers an advantage for some mini-games. Excessive rotating of the analog stick even resulted in blisters and burns to the hands, and Nintendo offered protective gloves to prevent injuries.<br/><br/>Rumble Pak<br/><br/>The original Rumble Pak, designed for the Nintendo 64 controller, was released in April 1997 to coincide with the release of Star Fox 64 and required two AAA batteries. Its specific use was to provide haptic feedback during gameplay; an effort to make the gaming experience more engaging. It was designed to be inserted into the controller's memory cartridge slot, which prevented the use of the Controller Pak. This usually had little impact, as Nintendo 64 games were cartridge based and had the ability to store saved data in the cartridge itself. This was also true because the insertion of a controller Pak was prompted at every point of save in case the before said Pak was not already in place.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Nintendo 64 controller&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "84732": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Reiner Knizia"], "poll": [], "name": "Kariba", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "14", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Zimbabwe"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1211360_t.jpg", "average": "5.89286", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Goliath B.V."], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1211360.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch edition", "French/Dutch/German edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Children's Game"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "All animals are thirsty after an adventurous day in the Savannah.

Each turn is affected by an event card drawn for that day.  Each turn is divided into two phases: Day and Night.  A 90 second timer is provided with the game to provide a  fair length for both phases.<br/><br/>During setup, survivor cards will be handed out.  One of the survivors will be Patient Zero and become a zombie at the end of the first day.  Each survivor starts with one item.  After everyone has an item, the group elects their leader.  Since no one knows anyone else's role, it is possible to elect Patient Zero as the group's leader.  Anytime the leader becomes a zombie, the survivors must elect a new leader before beginning the day phase.<br/><br/>During the day the elected leader of the survivors draws resource cards and the survivors discuss how to divide them up.  Some of the Survivors, however, are infected and will eventually join the Zombies attacking the Survivors.  At the end of each day, players check their character cards to see if they have become a zombie.<br/><br/>During the night, the players who have become zombies play attack cards of various types against the remaining survivors.  The survivors must work together to defend themselves using the resources they found during the day to resist and shunt off zombie attacks in order to survive.  Those who cannot stop or deflect a zombie attack, become zombies who will get a zombie attack card the next night.<br/><br/>The game's scenario runs for one week's time, from Sunday to Saturday.  Each turn an event card shapes both the day and night phases.  Each day the survivors use their drawn resources to make a plan for resisting the zombies.  Each night the zombies attack the survivors and try to wipe them out.  The game ends after the night phase on Saturday when those still alive win by surviving the zombie apocalypse, or else when all survivors are   dead (or undead, as it were).<br/><br/>"}, "84772": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic892478.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Corn\u00e9 van Moorsel"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Christof Tisch"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Cwali"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic892478_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Travel"], "boardgamehonor": ["2011 Nederlandse Spellenprijs Nominee", "2011 Spiel des Jahres Recommended"], "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>In *SUN, SEA &amp; SAND* each player starts a resort on a tourist island.

Yes, in spite of the prequels. It&rsquo;s sad that we Star Wars fanboys have to put that qualifier in these days, but such is the times we live in. As a Star Wars fan, I&rsquo;ve been playing the Star Wars games long before the prequels, which means long before Wizards of the Coast got their hands on Star Wars, and long before even Timothy Zahn wrote the first novels that gave the world a picture of what was going on with Luke, Leia, Han and Chewie after Return of the Jedi. That&rsquo;s right; I was playing the d6 West End Games version of Star Wars.<br/><br/>When I first played Savage Worlds a year or so back, I thought this would make an excellent rules system for Star Wars, and lo and behold I found I wasn&rsquo;t the only one who thought so. On the Savage Worlds Fan Conversion web page I already saw three good attempts to take a crack at it. Victor Lacroix&rsquo;s own Star Wars 1.2.1 conversion SAVAGE! Star Wars from the d20 Saga Edition was, by far, the best one of the bunch.<br/><br/>In all due respect to Mr. Lacroix and the people who helped him make that work, I thought that approaching Star Wars by converting the Saga Edition&rsquo;s version of things to Savage Worlds was the wrong way to go about it. Rather, the best way to making a Savage Worlds Star Wars game was to take what you see from all six movies and other materials as you see them, instead of what others interpret them to be.<br/><br/>With that in mind I set about to make my own Savage Worlds Star Wars conversion primarily because I was utterly tired of Saga Edition and d20 in general. When you&rsquo;ve played Savage Worlds, you look at d20 with a whole new perspective, wondering why they bothered to make things more complicated than it needed to be. I found myself ignoring or forgetting most of the rules for d20 because they got in the way of the game play itself.<br/><br/>"}, "84782": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Savage Dawn", "rpgdesigner": ["Markus Finster"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic980285.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": ["Barsaive"], "average": "6", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpg": ["Savage Worlds"], "rpgcategory": ["Alternate Rules (Variant Core Rules)", "Campaign Setting (game world)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic980285_t.jpg", "description": "Subtitle: A SAVAGE edition of EARTHDAWN<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/>Welcome to Savage Dawn!<br/>This little document is all you need to play Earthdawn with Savage Worlds rules.

Cities have turned into gangland prices; the highways, into battlefields.&quot;<br/><br/>Turn based strategy game from SSI taking their (at the time) well established tactical and strategic war gaming formulas into the genre of Mad Max. Players lead a road gang around a map of the United States searching for scientists who can bring an end to the plague attack. Players loot cities and towns for supplies and vehicles, search for new gang members and helpful specialists, and fight other armed gangs.<br/><br/>Game play took place on a map of the United States. Turns were usually in one or two hour blocks of time in an eight to ten hour day, but bad weather would cause time to pass more quickly. No travel or road combat took place at night, but night brought the threat of mutant attack.<br/><br/>When road combat occurred, the game switched to a tactical combat mode where the player moved around vehicles on a map of the terrain (highway, town, countryside, etc.) with men (&quot;Crew&quot;) acting more or less as both hit points and gun emplacements. Cars could be destroyed by killing all of the enemy crew, by ramming and destroying them with larger and/or better reinforced vehicles, or they could be made to crash by blasting out the tires. Your topside crew could also board enemy vehicles and commandeer them, which was very difficult to pull off.<br/><br/>Enemies came in three flavors: groups on foot encountered in cities, including the folks who controlled the city, road gangs like the players' own, and the plague infected mutants who roamed the night. Enemy road gangs usually had colorful names (&quot;Hot Rod Lincolns,&quot; &quot;Mother Truckers&quot; etc). Foot groups included mercenaries, street gangs, the Mob, Invaders (the game assumes a germ warfare attack was followed by a ground invasion), Satanists, cannibals, the homeless, and others.<br/><br/>When scouting out foot groups, players could also encounter specialists who would offer to join the gang. The specialists could be encountered in different places depending on their specialty. Doctors could be found at clinics or hospitals, or special locations like the Mayo Clinic. They reduced casualties during combat and reduced the risk of plague infection. Politicians could be encountered in Washington DC or among the homeless; they improved other groups attitudes towards you and made scouting less dangerous. Drill Instructors reduced combat losses, made your gang members better at combat, and sped the rate at which your men improved; they could be found at military bases or special locations like Colorado Springs.<br/><br/>Roadwar 2000 was a rather unforgiving game, befitting the genre. The game randomly resets itself whenever a new session begins, so nuclear blast sites and ownership of cities is always different (New York City could be occupied by Invaders one session, and owned by no one in the next one) and sometimes cruel. Players can expect to be wiped out many times before falling into a groove. Bad luck during starting placement could kill a players' gang very quickly - for example, starting off in a town next to a nuclear blast site (e.g. - starting in Baltimore when Washington DC has been destroyed) almost guaranteed being killed at night by mutants.

Beginning players can either be English natives or visitors from other nations in for their own personal reasons.<br/><br/>Setting: Originally designed as an introduction to Savage Worlds and the Space 1889 Victorian age science fiction adventuring, this adventure can be used without the Space 1889 background. Just ignore any references to travel to the other worlds of our solar system and play it as a Victorian Pulp setting.

A few things before we get started:<br/><br/>     The major change since the last version (v3.0) is the addition of a bestiary. I&rsquo;ve also added a section on heavy weapons, changed how shields work a bit, modified some talents, and tweaked the racial edges and hindrances a bit. There are also a variety of smaller changes and corrections that I won&rsquo;t enumerate here.<br/>     This is still primarily a conversion of the first video game; however, it does contain some things from the second game (e.g., a couple of PC races, a few talents / powers, some bad guys for the bestiary, etc.). Please don&rsquo;t contact me to tell that certain things work differently in the second game than in the first- I know already, thank you.<br/>     This is in no way a complete point-by-point conversion of every little thing from the video games. I draw your attention to the following excerpt from the SWEX core rule book: &quot;All too often conversions of other games try to account for every element- massive skill lists, minute details, and hundreds of powers. This isn&rsquo;t Savage Worlds, and bringing in those elements is likely to burden the rules to the point where the game play is no longer fast, furious, or fun&quot; (137). Indeed, FFF is my guiding principle. As such, you won&rsquo;t find stats for every single different brand of pistol, or skills that match every single aspect of the (first) video game character skill system. I&rsquo;ve also occasionally done things differently than the video games for gameplay balance or in order to make certain aspects of the Mass Effect universe cohere better with the SW rules (again, please don&rsquo;t contact me to tell me that things work differently in the games than I have here- I know). Ultimately, I&rsquo;m only interested in playing Savage Worlds with a Mass Effect flavor, not playing an exact replica of the video games in pen-and-paper form.<br/>     You won&rsquo;t find much fluff here- mainly just crunch. I don&rsquo;t spend a lot of time describing the Mass Effect universe, the races and cultures, the inhabitable worlds, the technology, or anything like that. I&rsquo;m assuming that if you&rsquo;re interested in this conversion, then you are already familiar with the video game, and don&rsquo;t need me to tell you about it. If you are looking for a bit more information, there are various wiki- Google will help you find them.<br/>     I&rsquo;ve made this for myself as GM. As such, I&rsquo;ve designed it for my personal preferences. I understand that there may be a variety of different ways to convert Mass Effect, all equally legitimate, but I&rsquo;ve stuck with creating a conversion that I want to run. If your preferences differ, just use from this what you like and change the rest.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "84796": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["SME pdf v1.0"], "poll": [], "name": "Savage Worlds Mass Effect (Version 1)", "rpgdesigner": ["Jim Alcala"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic980310.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": ["Mass Effect"], "average": "5", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Savage Worlds"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Alternate Rules (Variant Core Rules)", "Campaign Setting (game world)"], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction", "War"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic980310_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary: <br/>A web-published conversion of the Mass Effect video-game universe to the Savage Worlds system.

Just like in a fighting game, you have to know your character, know the matchup, and know your opponent. Each character has a deck that follows the same conventions as deck of playing cards. This makes it easy to learn the contents of your deck: numbered cards are normal moves, face cards are special moves, and aces are super moves.<br/><br/>Yomi is a competitive card game specifically designed and balanced to hold up to tournament play with many years of playtesting and tournaments behind it. It tests the skills of valuation and Yomi. Valuation refers to your ability to judge the relative value of moves (or cards) as they change over the course of the game. Yomi, the game's title, refers to your ability to &quot;read&quot; the patterns that your opponent unconsciously falls into. It's designed for high level play to be as interesting as possible and as balanced as possible.<br/><br/>Game Modes<br/><br/>     1v1, the main mode<br/>     2v2 Team Battle, inspired by video games such as Marvel vs Capcom<br/>     A solo mode to learn basic proficiency against an automated opponent<br/>     A 3v3 mode (can be played as 1v1 with multiple characters) inspired by video games such as King of Fighters<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>     Each player shuffles their deck and draws an opening hand of seven cards.<br/>     Turns are simultaneous and players draw one card per turn.<br/>     Each player plays a combat card face down, then reveals the cards simultaneously.<br/>     Resolve combat. Blocking an attack lets you draw a card; hitting with an attack or throw allows you to combo more cards from your hand; dodging an attack lets you hit back with a single move.<br/>     Bluff phase. After it's resolved who won combat, but before any combos are played, the player who might get hit by a combo can play a facedown Joker or bluff card. After the attacker finishes their combo, reveal that facedown card. If it's a Joker, the combo does no damage. If it's a non-Joker card, the combo does full damage as usual.<br/>     Power up: Players can discard pairs, 3-of-a-kinds, or 4-of-a-kinds to search their decks for Aces (super moves). Also, if they performed any chain combos (straights of sequential normal attacks, such as a 2,3,4,5) that turn, they can also search for Aces.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The game ends when one player is reduced to 0 life, or when one player draws the last card of their deck.

It was officially announced for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on May 16, 2008 by Rockstar Games. The game was developed by Rockstar San Diego. The game features 43 cars and 3 motorcycles. The open world map of Los Angeles is confirmed to be the size of all three cities from the previous installment combined. It has also been confirmed by several sources that each car has a polygon count of roughly 100,000. After several delays, Midnight Club: Los Angeles was released on October 21, 2008 in North America and on October 24, 2008 in the PAL region.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY:<br/><br/>The game is set in the city of Los Angeles, again providing the option to completely free-roam (in an open world environment larger than all the three cities combined from the previous game, Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition). New additions are a 24 hour day-to-night cycle, weather effects and traffic with licensed vehicles, adding a realistic aspect to the game. After races, if any damage is inflicted upon the vehicle, the player doesn't necessarily have to drive back to the garage for a full repair, but instead can choose the Quick Fix option through which old, junkyard-esque parts will be added to the car. To get the nice look back, the player must actually drive back to repair their vehicle at a garage or at a gas station, so totaling the car is only possible within a single race or event. With the RAGE system being used for this game, traffic levels fluctuate throughout the day, with heavy traffic in the morning and afternoon, and little traffic at night. Motorcycles are again part of the game, including the Ducati 999R and the hyper sport bike, Kawasaki Ninja ZX-14. Convertible cars, customizable interiors, in-game photo mode, and customizable exotics are all new additions.<br/><br/>The game is said to be the longest of the 4, with more than 10 different types of races including series races, tournaments, pink slip races, and even freeway races, there is always plenty to do. You even have options. For each race you must drive to the start line or racer which adds to why the game takes so long to beat. The races also have different difficulties. Easy, medium, hard, and hardest. The difficulties are color-coded with green being easy, yellow being medium, orange being hard, and red being hardest. Each difficulty race has greater rewards than the latter.<br/><br/>The Special Abilities options have also been brought into the game (a returning feature from the previous installment), which include EMP, when activated will disable the electronics of every vehicle around the player; Agro, when activated will make the player's vehicle indestructible giving him the ability to plow through traffic without slowing the car down; Roar, when activated will send out a sound wave moving traffic out of the player's way for a clear and straight path through the streets; Zone, when activated will slow down time allowing the player to get between that tough gap in the traffic or letting you get around that sharp corner without losing too much speed. The previous installment had limited which type of car could get that special ability, but all cars in this game can now have any one of the special abilities, that the player chooses. The abilities can also be changed at any time the player feels.<br/> Police return but are no longer scripted to a specific race; they will chase the player no matter where the player is and the longer the player runs from them, the higher the fine will be if the character is arrested. Developers placed great emphasis on the elimination of load screens, stating that the player can literally jump from career mode to an online race in under ten seconds. The new dynamic weather system has been reported to alter the gameplay experience, making the vehicle more prone to sliding in the rain.<br/><br/>ONLINE FEATURES:<br/><br/>Online play supports 16 players at once and a number of new modes will be introduced including, Keep Away where the player must hold the flag as long as he can and Stockpile in which there are numerous flags to be captured. New online power-ups mentioned include Mirror (will reflect any power-up fired at the player back to the person who fired it), Agro (will act the same as the offline special ability, increasing the players vehicle weight and enabling them to crash through other vehicles without taking damage or slowing down), and Random (gives the player a random power-up). A new aspect entitled &quot;Rate My Ride&quot; is also to be introduced, where the players can go online to view vehicles that other players have created.<br/><br/>PlayStation Network trophies are also included, with a total of 46 trophies to be won.<br/><br/>COMPLETE EDITION:<br/><br/>On October 12, 2009, Rockstar Games released the Midnight Club: Los Angeles - Complete Edition as a PlayStation 3 Greatest Hit / Platinum and a Xbox 360 Platinum Hit.[19] This version of the game includes the main game and all of the previously available downloadable content on the disc.<br/><br/>Included in the Complete Edition:<br/><br/>* Core game<br/>    * South Central<br/>          o Map Expansion<br/>          o Premium Upgrade<br/>          o Vehicle Pack #1<br/>          o Vehicle Pack #2<br/>    * Police Car Pack<br/>    * More Licensed Music<br/>    * New Vinyl Packages<br/><br/>MIDNIGHT CLUB: LA REMIX:<br/><br/>Midnight Club: L.A. Remix is a portable version of Midnight Club: Los Angeles, which was announced by Rockstar Games on April 21, 2008 for PlayStation Portable. The game was released on October 21, 2008 in North America and on October 24, 2008 in the PAL region.<br/><br/>The game features only a portion of Los Angeles, using the same map from Midnight Club II. Making up for this, the game features another playable city, Tokyo, which uses the same map from Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition Remix. Unlike the console version, the police do not chase the player in &quot;Cruise&quot; mode. However, the player can get caught after running from the police for a long period of time, and eventually getting boxed in, and getting no fine. Also unlike the console version, Midnight Club: L.A. Remix does not feature cut scenes. Also,the cars in the game have been split up meaning that one half of the cars can be used in Los Angeles while the other half can be used in Tokyo, the bikes aren't split as all three can be used in Los Angeles and Tokyo.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Midnight Club: Los Angeles,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "84860": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Tom Harvey"], "average": "6.33333", "poll": [], "name": "LineUp!", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Building"], "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1189106_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Tom Harvey"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "(Web published)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1189106.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Print & Play"], "age": "3", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "LineUp! is played on a 5x5 grid of squares, with circles at each corner of these squares forming a 6x6 grid.

A token may only be captured if you have a line of tokens adjacent to the token you wish to capture that is greater in length than the line of your<br/>opponent&rsquo;s adjacent tokens in the opposite direction.

The deck consists of 40 cards, numbered 0-7 in five colors, with the colors ranked on the cards: purple (high), blue, green, yellow, red (low). Note that all 7s are higher than any 6, which are each higher than any 5, and so on.<br/><br/>At the start of a round, each player is dealt seven cards. Players pass 0-3 cards to their left or right neighbor depending on the round number. Players then predict the number of tricks they'll take by choosing a card in their hand and simultaneously revealing them. The player with the highest bid becomes start player for the round, and the color of that player's card indicates the trump suit for that round. These bidding cards are then returned to the players' hands.<br/><br/>The start player for a trick lays down a card, and each player must follow the lead by playing a card of the same color or number. If this isn't possible, they can play any card. The highest trump card played (if any) wins the trick; otherwise the highest card played that followed the lead (including number!) wins the trick. After seven tricks, the round ends. Making one's bid nets two points plus the number of tricks bid, while missing results in a loss of one point for every under- or over-trick. The player with the highest score after seven rounds wins.<br/><br/>An optional rule forbids the bids from summing to seven. If this occurs, the player with the highest bid scores one point, then the bid cards are set aside and players rebid from the cards remaining in hand.

Versions for the Amiga, Atari ST and PC were also released. The music in the Commodore 64 version was composed by Martin Galway.<br/><br/>Wizball's more comical sequel, Wizkid, was released in the early 1990s for the Amiga, Atari ST and IBM PC.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The theme of Wizball is unique. It is a horizontally-scrolling game, which involves navigating around a landscape and shooting at sprites. However, the aim of the game is to collect droplets of coloured paint to colour the level. Each level starts off as monochromatic, drawn in three shades of grey, and needs three colours to be collected to complete it. The player, a wizard  who has taken the form of a green ball, has access to three levels at a time, and can navigate between them through portals. Each level has droplets of a different primary colour  which may be collected. At the same time, each level needs a different colour to be added, which can be composed by collecting sufficient quantities of the correct primary colours.<br/><br/>The wizard himself is not capable of collecting paint droplets, and is initially capable of very limited movement, bouncing up and down at a fixed rate, with the player only controlling a speed of rotation, and thus how fast it will move horizontally after next touching the ground. Collecting green pearls (which appear when some sprites have been shot) gives the player tokens which can be used to &quot;buy&quot; enhancements, such as greater control over movement and improved firepower, and also a companion known as Catellite. Catellite (effectively the wizard's cat) is also spherical in form. It normally follows the wizard, but it can also be moved independently by holding down the fire button whilst moving the joystick (which also renders the wizard uncontrollable). Only Catellite is capable of collecting paint droplets; the player has to use it to do so. In the two-player mode, Catellite is controlled by the second player. As well as droplets of primary colours, sometimes droplets of other colours also appear, having various effects. These include:<br/><br/>* Light blue - causes a &quot;filth raid&quot;, where a wave of fast-moving enemies appear, shooting bullets at the player.<br/>    * Grey - changes Catellite into an &quot;Indestructacat&quot;, making it invulnerable to enemies.<br/>    * White - gives an extra life.<br/>    * Purple - changes Catellite into a &quot;mutant cat&quot;, causing it to disobey the player's controls.<br/>    * Black - causes &quot;freaky bits&quot;, turning most of the scenery black.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Wizball&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>Back cover of Amiga game box<br/>For many years, Wiz and his feline friend Catelite have lived happily in the colourful land of Wizworld. However, an evil force called Zark has moved in with his horrible sprites. Zark is determined to turn the colourful land dull and grey once and for all. Your aim is to aid Catelite in restoring these original colours by shooting RED, BLUE and GREEN coulour bubbles and collecting the valuable chemicals as they burst. But watch out! Zark is constantly on your heels to kill you off. There are hidden features that Wizball and Catelite can use to prolong their existence. Wizball is a fast-paced game that will transport you to an exciting world of fun, fear and fantasmagoria.<br/><br/>"}, "84868": {"poll": [], "name": "Wizkid", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["EN/FR/DE DOS 5 1/4\" Disk edition", "US Amiga 3.5\" Disk edition"], "average": "7.5", "videogameseries": ["Wizball"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Sensible Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Arcade", "Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "DOS"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Ocean Software"], "description": "Wizkid is a computer game for the Amiga, Atari ST and IBM PC computers, developed by Sensible Software and released by Ocean Software in 1992.<br/><br/>Wizkid is officially the sequel to the earlier game Wizball, developed and released by the same companies.<br/><br/>The game<br/><br/>The story starts after the Wiz and his cat Nifta had restored colours to their world. They were both married (to different spouses, apparently) and had children: the Wiz had a son, Wizkid, and Nifta had eight kittens. All was peaceful and happy until the evil mouse wizard Zark came and kidnapped the Wiz, Nifta, and all the kittens, imprisoning them in different parts of the world. It is Wizkid's job to save them.<br/><br/>Wizkid is a humorous arcade adventure game taking place over nine levels. Each level has a different style, with a different background picture and music. The levels are:<br/><br/>1. Sunset Wizoward, a normal rural landscape.<br/>   2. Ahoy Wiz Maties, a sunken sailing ship under water.<br/>   3. Mount Wizimanjaro, a volcano.<br/>   4. Elementree my dear Wizkid, a giant tree.<br/>   5. The Ghost of Wizkid Past, a graveyard.<br/>   6. Wizkid and the Wizball Mystery, a shoot 'em up game similar to the bonus sequence in Wizball.<br/>   7. Wizkid goes to the Circus, a circus.<br/>   8. Wizkid meets Dog Girl, a woman who barks like a dog.<br/>   9. Jailhouse Wiz, a giant turtle with a jail on its back.<br/><br/>In each level, the player plays the disembodied head of Wizkid, which can fly around the screen in all four directions. The object is to knock various objects on top of enemies, killing them. When all enemies are killed, play proceeds to the next screen, and after all screens have been completed, proceeds to the next level.<br/><br/>In the action parts of the game, two bonus objects are on offer - a nose which allows Wizkid to juggle blocks, and teeth allowing him to grip them (they can even be taken to different screens - taking a large block onto a screen with only small blocks can be advantageous). The teeth are temporary, but failing to complete a level sees you lose either item. A bonus &quot;Crossword 2091&quot; screen is sometimes activated by failing to complete a level, in which the player is presented with a grid and a sequence of words, which must be arranged so as to interlock into a crossword-style arrangement. Completion of this, which involves a fair amount of trial and error, adds $500 to the bank balance.<br/><br/>The adventure aspect of the game comes into play when Wizkid manages to collect a whole sequence of bonus musical notes. This allows him to re-embody his head and interact with the background landscape. Items can be bought with money, and must be used throughout the game to collect enough kittens to reach Zark's Castle before Zark can get back. These puzzles often include humorous interludes - for example, on the first level you must distract a vicious-looking dog by giving him a newspaper; moments later he can be seen reading it whilst sitting in an out-house toilet. There is one more mystery task to be completed in order to win the game.<br/><br/>Wizkid uses the famous &quot;level warping&quot; system originally introduced in Super Mario Bros. in reverse. Playing only the arcade part only takes the player to levels 1, 4, 7 and 9. Hidden routes in the adventure part are required to access the other levels, and thus obtain enough kittens to complete the game. Level 3 must be completed in &quot;head mode&quot;, and it features some of the harder screens.<br/><br/>Wizkid continued a thread common in Sensible Software games of introducing hidden obscenity in apparently-justified gaming terms. In Wizkid, when the player completes the sequence of musical notes, all of them drop from the status display at the top of the screen into the play area, exploding into a number of gold coins which the player can collect for extra points. This sequence was referred to in the manual as the &quot;golden shower&quot;.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Wizkid&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "84869": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic826530.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Michael Schacht"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Julien Delval"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Matagot", "Asmodee"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic826530_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Exploration", "Medieval", "Mythology", "Territory Building"], "description": "Felinia is the third part in the Gold Trilogy, after Valdora and The Golden City.

It is a metal suitcase-style box with a plastic insert that is perfect for holding the cards included in the Munchkin card games. It also comes with some German cards and a Kill-O-Meter.<br/><br/>Where do I get the Sammlerkoffer?<br/>Pegasus Spiele's shop is the easiest way to order it. See the &quot;Links&quot; section for the link to the game page, which has a link to the shop page. The site is mostly in German, but there is a translation option at the top right that makes it easy enough to get through the ordering process without knowing any German (note that it will not translate the product description). Note that you will not pay during the checkout process. Instead, Pegasus Spiele will contact you (using English) and give you instructions on how to pay via either bank transfer or Paypal.<br/><br/>How much does it cost?<br/>It costs 39,95 Euro plus an additional 15 Euro shipping to most locations (at least to the US and Australia, Europe might be less). Payment must be made by either International Bank Transfer or Paypal as specified in the previous question.<br/><br/>What else do you get with it?<br/>There are 101 included cards with German text and backs for various sets. There is also a Kill-O-Meter. The Sammlerkoffer also has its own special rule.<br/><br/>What is the Sammlerkoffer's special rule?<br/>If you are playing with cards that all come from a single Sammlerkoffer, the owner of the Sammlerkoffer may, once per game, take a card from either draw pile at any time that they are not in combat. If more than one person brings a Sammlerkoffer, then play with cards from the heavier Sammlerkoffer.<br/><br/>Are the cards usable with English Munchkin sets?<br/>Some of them can be mixed into your existing sets, but the German backs for some cards are different from the original versions, so they would stand out.<br/><br/>     The backs of the Munchkin cards, both Treasures and Doors, are significantly darker than the English versions.<br/>     The card backs for the following games have the game name in German: Munchkin Bites!; The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin; and Munchkin Booty.<br/>     The cards with the same backs are for Star Munchkin; Super Munchkin; Munchkin Cthulhu; and Munchkin Fu.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>How many cards are there for each themed set?<br/>The breakdown is as follows:<br/><br/><br/><br/>    <br/>         Munchkin: 45 Doors and 30 Treasures<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Super Munchkin: 1 Door and 1 Treasure<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Munchkin Bites!: 6 Doors and 1 Treasure<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Munchkin Cthulhu: 2 Doors and 4 Treasures<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin: 1 Treasure<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Star Munchkin: 3 Doors and 1 Treasure<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Munchkin Booty: 2 Doors and 1 Treasure<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Munchkin Fu: 3 Doors<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Can sleeved cards fit into the Sammlerkoffer?<br/>Some can, but it is a tight fit. The 56mm x 87mm standard sleeves from Mayday just fit inside the box. Nobody has reported yet whether the premium version of the sleeves or if other types of sleeves fit or not. Note that the sleeved cards do take up more room, so you will get about 25% less cards in the box.<br/><br/>How many cards fit inside the Sammlerkoffer?<br/>By my estimate, approximately 4,000 unsleeved cards or 3,000 sleeved cards can fit if you pack them tightly. This is not counting the areas set aside for rules, dice and Dungeon cards.<br/><br/>How are the card areas arranged?<br/>The plastic base of the Sammlerkoffer includes spaces for various decks and expansions. The included insert suggests putting each core set and expansion in a different slot, but as the ratio of decks to expansions is approximately equivalent to the ratio between Doors and Treasures, it is possible to use a pair of slots (one large, one medium) for the Doors and Treasures of sets with one 112 card expansion or two 56 card expansions, which is perfect for most of the Munchkin themes. The number of slots and approximate number of unsleeved cards that each slot can hold are as follows:<br/><br/>     11 slots for core sets or Doors of an expanded set fitting about 190 cards each.<br/>     12 slots for 112 card expansions or Treasures of an expanded set fitting about 125 cards each.<br/>     6 slots for Boosters and Promo cards fitting about 60 cards each.<br/>     4 slots for Dungeon cards fitting about 40 Dungeon cards each.<br/>     1 slot for storing rules, dice, bookmarks, Kill-O-Meters, pawns and whatever else you want to store.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Is the Kill-O-Meter the same as the Steve Jackson Games version?<br/>Not quite. It features the same art, but it uses different card stock.<br/><br/>What icons are on the cards?<br/>All 101 cards have an icon for the Sammlerkoffer. In addition, 55 of the cards have the More Good Cards icon, one card has the Kill-O-Meter icon, and one card has the Crazed Caverns icon.<br/><br/>What are the translations of the included cards?<br/>We do not provide a translation of the cards here.

Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.<br/><br/>The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.<br/><br/>The game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds.  Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles.  At the beginning of each round all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die.  A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die.  During each round players take their turns in the current turn order.  During his turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions: 1) take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of his dice and place it in the staging area on his player board, 2) take a settlement tile from the staging area of his player board to a space on his player board with a number matching one of his dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile, 3) deliver goods with a number matching one of his dice, or 4) take worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of his dice.  In addition to these actions a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on his player board.  If an action triggers the award of victory points, those points are immediately recorded.  Each settlement tile offers a benefit, additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points.  Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.<br/><br/>The game ends when the last player finishes his turn of the fifth round of the fifth phase.  Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers, and undelivered goods.  Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The player with the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>The rules include basic and advanced versions.<br/><br/>This game is #14 in the Alea big box series.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Chinese Edition", "Hobby World Russian first edition", "Ravensburger English/French Edition", "Ravensburger Multilingual First Edition", "Ravensburger Multilingual Second Edition"], "average": "8.11046", "name": "The Castles of Burgundy", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Set Collection", "Tile Placement", "Variable Phase Order"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["Brettspiel Adventskalender 2015", "The Castles of Burgundy: 1st Expansion \u2013 New Player Boards", "The Castles of Burgundy: 2nd Expansion \u2013 New Hex Tiles", "The Castles of Burgundy: 3rd Expansion \u2013 German Board Game Championship Board 2013", "The Castles of Burgundy: 4th Expansion \u2013 Monastery Boards", "The Castles of Burgundy: 5th Expansion \u2013 Pleasure Garden", "The Castles of Burgundy: 6th Expansion - The Cloisters", "The Castles of Burgundy: 7th Expansion \u2013 German Board Game Championship Board 2016", "The Castles of Burgundy: Trade Routes", "Stadt Land Spielt Limitierter Sonderdruck Tag des Gesellschaftsspiels"], "usersrated": "24450", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Alea Big Box", "Country: France"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["30 Minutes Around the Table", "6.

Once a person lays down a group of cards, other players -- including the player who played the original set -- can now &quot;lay off&quot; cards to that group.<br/><br/>The unique components of this game are:<br/><br/>1.    Negative Cards - When you think your opponent has amassed too many points and is about to win the game, take revenge and play your negative cards to take points away for your opponent.<br/><br/>2.    Discarding your card Downsideup - If you have been watching which cards your opponent is collecting and you think your discard is going to help them, then play your discard &ldquo;Downsideup&rdquo; to keep your opponent from seeing that card, but remember where you put it so you can play it again later.<br/><br/>3.

As with any congressional action, many interest groups had to be satisfied.  One of these groups was the Humor Lobby.  If improvements had to be made, they should be funny.  Congress thought long and hard on what could be done to generate the most amount of laughter over the longest period of time.  Then the idea came to them.  Why not take the capital city which belongs to all of the country&rsquo;s citizens, and hand it over to a few local people who tried to burn it down in the 1960&rsquo;s&rdquo;.  At this suggestion smiles broke out on the Congressmen&rsquo;s faces as the potential for a  massive comic effect rolled through their minds.

The &lsquo;wheeling, dealing and stealing&rsquo; which occurred as a result of this act kept the city and the country laughing for years.  The District of Chaos lurched from misadventure, to atrocity, to debacle, and then back again, as the inmates played government.

The minimum is 30 but you may have more, as many as you wish.<br/><br/>-There are no doubles allowed of EVOKER or ENTIS cards (you may have 2 cards of the<br/>same name as long as the illustration is different) but you may have up to 3 copies of all MONSTER/BOSS and SKILL cards.<br/><br/>-Each player starts with 90HP.<br/><br/>Select an EVOKER to start then shuffle your deck and draw 5 cards (this applies to both starting players).<br/><br/>Roll a dice to see who plays their EVOKER first. If its you draw a card and play an ENTIS or MONSTER/BOSS card(s). You may not attack on your 1st turn (this applies to both starting players).<br/>When both players have set-up defenses, ENTIS or MONSTER/BOSS card(s) then another dice roll is done and whoever has the highest dice roll may attack and have their 2nd turn.<br/><br/>After that, turns just alternate accordingly.<br/><br/>How a Battle Turn Goes...<br/>1.Draw a card.<br/>2.Play an EVOKER, ENTIS and/or MONSTER/BOSS card(s).<br/>3.Play any Add-Ons or SKILL cards.<br/>4.Attack (Enter Battle Mode)<br/>5.Play ONLY any other SKILL cards you wish.<br/>6.Turn end.<br/><br/>An Encounter (the entire course of your game) proceeds until one of you loses all their HP or a player can no longer draw cards.<br/><br/>02/02/11<br/><br/>        NEW**<br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Theme Decks out!<br/>Starlit Night Deck: Use a deck brimming with the chaotic energy of the stars!<br/><br/>Harness the unpredictable power of the stars (Star-Type Cards) in this all new strategically structured theme deck. Use &quot;Affuse&quot; to evoke and then re-evoke fallen Enti all the while playing lady-luck by using Star Monsters and their random, high-risk effect Abilities.<br/><br/>If you like to tempt fate (while using &quot;Marlain&quot; to redo your die rolls) then this deck is for you. Watch as your opponent's well laid plans crumble.<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>Darkside Moon Deck: Decimate foes with raw power and the inverse strategy of dark matter!<br/><br/>Darkness and destruction await all those who face the power of the moon (Moon-Type Cards). This deck while lacking in Enti power relies on hordes of Monster/Boss Cards particularly &quot;Cronie&quot; a dark bird who returns automatically once defeated.<br/><br/>Master dark matter and increase your attack power, all the while using inverse tactics to raise your HP and reduce your opponents.

The players are encouraged to create unique and varied characters. This book presents many options for players, however, it should be noted that &quot;the Lands&quot; is a truly fantastical setting with a heavy interracial climate. Therefore, it is suggested that the players and GM be open to incorporating any race or prestige class found in other d20 books as well as reliable Internet sources. In fact, there are many great products from both big and small publishers that can be melded together to generate a truly unique role-playing experience for all involved.<br/><br/>In the Lands, many races were united as slaves under the rule of dragons and their sorcereous progeny. Since that time, the races have drifted apart, developing their own cultures. Still, many cities see all sorts of races within their gates. Therefore, PCs can play goblinoids, werecreatures, giants, etc., as long as the GM and player can come to an agreement about the inclusion of the character into the campaign. The same liberalization of prestige classes, feats, spells and other sources for gaming material should be integrated into an Elemental Land campaign. The only exception to this rule is the use of dragon creatures or halfdragon template characters. These creatures are extremely important to the history of the Lands, and as such, the author believes that the GM and players should agree that dragons and half-dragons be left as rare NPCs and creature encounters.<br/><br/>"}, "84930": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["d20 Modern"], "poll": [], "name": "Ballistic Evolution", "rpgdesigner": ["M.

Five different models of the SwanSong Armory Uzi retrofits are detailed - including the Uzi Support pictured above, with the attached 30mm grenade launcher - two models are illustrated. A Chechen reduced assault rifle, based almost entirely on the classic M-16, the Insurgent is designed for close-quarter and house-to-house fighting common in urban engagements. The weapon is very short overall, and is treated more as a large submachine gun than as an assault rifle. Heckler &amp; Koch is one of the most famous manufacturers of military personal firearms in the modern age. The MP10 'slimline' subguns were developped concurrently with the BMP-9 series (below) and the UMP submachine guns. The MP10 line features a lower profile than the earlier MP-5s and UMPs and is available in a variety of calibers and two basic models. In all, 6 models of the MP10 series are described and detailed in this product, along with two illustrations. The Heckler &amp; Koch BMP-9 takes the classic MP-5 line and mates it with a helical magazine, allowing for extended autofire (or 'combat endurance'). Although somewhat awkward in weight and handling, the design allows for a 42-round box magazine to be used without significantly increasing the total height of the gun. 21 models of the BMP9 series are described and detailed, along with three illustrations. The descendant of the Druganov SVD, one of the world's most famous sniper rifles, the Druganov PIR (Product Improved Rifle) is the new standard marksman rifle for the Russian military (in the classic 7.62x54mm chambering of the SVD) and Ministry of Internal Affairs (in the 9mmx39mm SP-6 chambering). In addition, a variety of export models are in production. 6 models of the PIR are described and detailed, along with an illustration.<br/><br/>"}, "84931": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["d20 Modern"], "poll": [], "name": "BPR-8 Binary Propellant Rifle", "rpgdesigner": ["M.

The asphalt player tries to connect the north and south borders.<br/><br/>The concrete player plays first. Then on the asphalt player's first turn only, if he or she feels the concrete player has too much advantage from the placement of the first two concrete tiles, the asphalt player may opt to trade tiles and roles. The asphalt player becomes the concrete player and vice versa.  Whether or not roles are reversed, the asphalt player then takes a turn. Player turns then alternate for the rest of the game. Players may not pass a turn unless they have no legal move. Consecutive passes can never occur.<br/><br/>During a turn, an engineer may do any one of the following three actions:<br/>1.    Pave a road without replacement,<br/>2.    Pave a road with replacement, or <br/>3.    Resolve a crossroads dispute by swapping tiles.<br/><br/>To pave a road without replacement, a player places two of his or her road sections on two horizontally or vertically adjacent empty parcels of land.<br/><br/>To pave a road with replacement, a player places two of his or her road sections on two horizontally or vertically adjacent parcels of land, where one parcel is empty and the other cell contains an opponent's road section.

New crossroad disputes may arise due to the resolution of a dispute. In this case, the resolution of the newly formed dispute(s) may not immediately recreate the first dispute. This restriction, which prevents position repetition, applies only to your opponent's immediate response. On later player turns, the resolution can be reversed by either player.<br/>      <br/>A road section is indestructible, only if, all its adjacent north, south, east and west land parcels (that exist on the game board) have been paved by either player and it is not part of a crossroads dispute.<br/><br/>Goal: The first civil engineer to pave a thruway (connected path of horizontally and/or vertically adjacent indestructible road sections) connecting their two sides of the landscape wins the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "8", "name": "Thruway", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Enclosure", "Tile Placement"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Connection Games"]}, "84947": {"rpgdesigner": ["Derek Carver", "Stuart Dagger", "John Harrington", "Ted Kendrick", "Paul Mason", "Alan R.

He secretly hid it in a royal treasury hall, that no one dared to enter.That was one of the most important tasks of his life. Centuries later, an archaeologist excavated the same item the wizard had placed in the treasury hall. The archaeologist, also hid the item in a secret place called the Continuum Vault. His purpose was the same as the wizard&rsquo;s. To leave the item in the Vault, until the proper passing of the centuries, like a good wine in a cellar. In the far future, an agent that had access to the continuum vault, extracted the item she had asked from the wizard and the  archaeologist to keep safe through the centuries.<br/><br/>THE GUILD. The Wizard was a founding member of a Wizard&rsquo;s Guild that managed the impossible. To travel without moving. Although, the moving wasn&rsquo;t through space. The Guild discovered that when you manage to travel without using the dimensions of space, you travel through time. Hence, the new name of the Guild was based on the event of that movement through time, the Total Inertia Moving Event Guild, or simply T I M E Guild. Centuries passed, the coming of the Nano Age totally reformed the Guild into a T I M E Agency and gave a new agenda to its members: The molecular processing. The Agency could combine almost anything in order to create new properties it could utilize. But, some items needed to be centuries old in order to evolve or to become suitable for the processing. Therefore, the Agency decided to cooperate with its members from times past in order to bring items to the future in their desirable state. So, there were many ways for one to do that. You could simply travel back in time instruct someone in the past, to hide an item for you in a place that you knew, and travel back in your time and take the item, which now would be centuries old. Or, you could take an item from your time and hide it somewhere in the past by yourself and take it back when you return in the future. But, the T I M E Agency has many members, so that it can function properly in all Eras. If you travel back in time, too far away from your Era, it could be hard to adjust in the ways people had in the past, so, the help of another person from that Era makes the procedure easier. Usually, a Mission that includes the keeping of an item through the centuries, is concluded by 3 members: A Wizard, an Archaeologist, and a T I M E Agent specialized in traveling through the ages.<br/><br/>Components.<br/>1 board.<br/>4 player sheets.<br/>12 pawns (3 for each player).<br/>108 cards.<br/>1 rulebook.<br/><br/>GAME-PLAY. <br/>All players begin the game with a mission that requires at least 4 items of different properties. Each player during his/er round uses his/er 3 pawns, which are the Wizard, the Archaeologist and the T I M E traveler. The board of the game is divided in three regions that represent three aspects of time: Past Present and Future. Each pawn starts from one of these regions and moves in order. First the Wizard can move in regions of the Past to collect information about powerful items and artifacts and then gather the items and/or artifacts for which he possesses the proper information. Then, the Archaeologist, moves in the Present regions in which he can also gather items that are somewhat different from the Past items and he can gather some more info about artifacts of the Past that might help the Wizard find them. Last, the Time Traveler moves and starts from the future areas, in which she can also gather info and items. The difference in the future region is that, items gathered here are built for time travel, which means that they evolve as the centuries pass. It is best for the Time traveler to travel back in time and leave these items in the Past or the Present to age and become stronger. Each item in Continuum Run has tiers, 3 sometimes 4. When an item is new, it begins from tier 3. Some areas on the board allow the players to store items and take them back from another time period. For example in the Present regions there is the Continuum Vault. If the Archaeologist stores an item of tier 3 in the Present it stays there until someone takes it. The Continuum Vault has its future version, in which the time traveler can go and take the item the Archaeologist has stored. But, centuries have passed, so the item must be replaced with a lower tier. Tier 2 in this case. Different tiers have different values. So, if a player requires for his/er mission an item with a value of Ruination 3, and s/he possesses a future item that has Ruination 2, s/he may store that item in one region and take it back from the next.<br/>GOAL.<br/>Any player that has at least 4 items that his/er mission requires may cause an endgame, during which, a last round is played and then players score Victory Points for each item and/or artifact they have managed to send to the Future Area called Molecular Processor.<br/><br/>"}, "84962": {"poll": [], "name": "The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game: Gondor in Flames",

It was developed by Zippo Games for Rare Ltd. and first released in 1989 by Acclaim. The series is noteworthy for its unique emphasis on vertical platforming and the importance of precision jumping over traditional combat elements.<br/><br/>In Ironsword, the hero of the series, Kuros, must face off once again against the evil wizard Malkil, who has taken control of the four elementals of the world&mdash;wind, water, fire and earth. Each of the four elemental realms consists of two stages. In the first stage, Kuros must find a golden artifact which belongs to the Animal King of the realm; once accomplished, the path to the second part of the realm will appear. In the second stage, the goal is to find the magic spell which can be used to fight the elemental boss. Without the spell, it is impossible to damage the boss. Once the elemental in each stage has been destroyed, Kuros obtains a piece of the legendary Iron Sword, which is needed for the final battle on Icefire Mountain.<br/><br/>This installment of the series introduces some new gameplay elements. Gems and keys still exist, although the former are used for monetary purposes and the latter can be used to open the many chests strewn throughout the game world. Shops that sell keys, food, spells, and special items can be found in each stage of the game world save the last two. Kuros can also gamble at a Pachinko-style game of chance in each shop, where the goal is to guess the path of a falling skull as it lands in one of four possible goblets. Also new to the series are magic spells which give Kuros special abilities for a limited period of time. Some spells can be used at any time, while others are only for specific situations.<br/><br/>The game is widely regarded to be the most difficult entry in the series and one of the more &quot;annoyingly hard games&quot; due to poor collision detection, inaccurate or chaotic damage distribution, and a notoriously frustrating final battle. Despite the erratic combat system, continues are now limited. The player can only rely on two continues, and cannot continue the game at any point after completing the third realm of five. The game still includes a 12-letter password system, however the password system does not allow for more than two lives to be carried over from a previous session.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Ironsword: Wizards &amp; Warriors II&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "84976": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Roger Krykon"], "average": "5.5", "poll": [], "name": "Das Kopflose Dinner: Die Verlobungsfeier", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "9", "boardgamemechanic": ["Acting", "Role Playing", "Storytelling"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic840715_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Alexander M\u00fcller"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["samhain Verlag"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic840715.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Medieval", "Murder/Mystery", "Party Game"], "age": "16", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "&quot;Die Verlobunsgfeier&quot; (= &quot;the espousal&quot;) is the dawn of this medieval trilogie around the intrigue of the family &quot;Gr&auml;fingen&quot;. &quot;Theodor von Gr&auml;fingen&quot; (lord of the castle Gr&auml;fingen) invites his guests for the engagement of his daughter &quot;Heidelinde von Gr&auml;fingen&quot; and the young and prosperous &quot;Brechtwein von Schweinsbergen&quot;.

The game begins in 1938 with Indy receiving a package from Venice, Italy that turns out to be his father&rsquo;s Grail Diary. At the same time he receives a telegram from Marcus Brody telling him the Cross of Coronado is on a ship off the Portuguese coast. The player is then presented with the choice of recovering the Cross of Coronado or going to Venice.<br/><br/>When the player goes to recover the Cross, they are on a ship and must defeat a certain number of Panama Hat&rsquo;s goons before fighting the boss himself. By recovering the cross Indy will receive a telegraph from Sallah who knows the location of the Holy Grail. Afterwards the player can head to Venice where they are presented with a sliding puzzle challenge. The player must complete the puzzle before the fire, traveling through the tunnel, engulfs the room. By solving the puzzle in time Indy receives a sketch showing the true holy grail. Another telegraph arrives from Sallah telling that Henry Jones, Sr. was taken captive by the Nazis is being held at Brunwald Castle and Marcus Brody has gone missing.<br/><br/>Saving Marcus takes place on top of a German tank in Iskenderun where Indy has to kill Nazis and Colonel Vogel before the tank plunges over a cliff. If the player fails, the Nazis steal the diary and Indy must travel to Berlin to recover it via a motorcycle riding sequence. At Brunwald Castle the player must navigate a convoluted maze to find Henry Jones Sr, although if caught they again must travel to Berlin to recover the diary.<br/><br/>At the Final level of the game, the player finds themselves at the Lost Temple. They must careful navigate the floor to spell out the word &ldquo;Jehovah&rdquo;. If they stand on the same tile for too long it falls or if they take too long the torch goes out. Afterwards they reach the final sanctum containing the Knight and several grails. If the player has the sketch from Venice it will aid in identifying the correct grail.

The core is made of famous figures like the Red Riding Hood, the Wolf or perhaps a Dragon. But these figures appear in slightly different situations than usual. In addition there are many monsters in Bizzaria, which are actually the main focus of the game. How bizarre these monsters will be depends on the players...<br/><br/>The monsters in Bizzaria are created together by players. During the game the monsters are increasingly shaped in their looks and foremost in what they say. The players use parts of cardboard faces and assemble them on a paper. Then they draw the monster around them and these papers represent the &quot;game board&quot;. Thus the &quot;game board&quot; is different and unique in each game. The cards in the game are used for the TV announcements and questions. All these clues lead the player to perceive the monsters in a certain way. In each round a special question is asked - in the form of &quot;Which of them is like this and this?&quot;. The players then look at the monsters and try to find three of them that (according to their opinion) best answer the question.<br/><br/>After each player secretly writes down his three choices they are all revealed and scored. The game also includes expansions and specialties.<br/><br/>The players have two essential goals. The first is to build up the character of the monsters where in each round the monsters comment on the actual course of events in a Bizzarian TV. The comments are entirely up to the players and they can range from a single interjection (Meow) to highly sophisticated expressions (If he were not a nihilist, I would not be such a therapist).

Perhaps most notably, each division contained only 20 teams, whereas in real life they contained 22 or 24 teams at that time. Also included were all of the major domestic cups of the time (including the Anglo-Italian Cup) and the 3 major European trophies (including the now defunct Cup Winners' Cup).<br/><br/>Any teams outside of the four playable divisions and all foreign teams had no player names at all. Instead, players were simply called &quot;No.3&quot; or &quot;No.10&quot; depending on which position they played.<br/><br/>One of the most innovative things about the game was the introduction of &quot;average ratings&quot; for players - after each match the performance of every player was graded from 0-10 and as the season went on the player's average rating would allow the manager to easily see how each player was performing.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Championship Manager,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "84994": {"poll": [], "name": "Championship Manager 93", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["EN/EU Amiga edition", "EN/EU DOS edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Championship Manager"], "videogametheme": ["Sports - Soccer"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameexpansion": ["Championship Manager 93: 1993/94 Season Data Up-Date Disk", "Championship Manager 93: End of 1994 Season Data Up-Date Disk"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Sports Interactive Limited"], "videogamefranchise": ["Championship Manager/Football Manager"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "DOS"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Domark"], "description": "Championship Manager 93/94 refers to the second installment in the Championship Manager series of football management computer games.<br/><br/>This game improved on the original in many ways - by far the most significant change was the use of real player names for the first time.

When you have a strength advantage in a row or column, you can push your opponent off the board and out of the fortress.  The player who loses 3 characters first is defeated.  The optional cards add a greater element of risk by allowing a player to sacrifice a character counter in exchange for a random card.  A card may give a player the edge needed to win the game, or it may yield nothing at all.<br/><br/>"}, "84997": {"poll": [], "name": "Championship Manager 93: End of 1994 Season Data Up-Date Disk", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["European Amiga edition", "European DOS edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Championship Manager"], "videogametheme": ["Sports - Soccer"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameexpansion": ["Championship Manager 93"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Sports Interactive Limited"], "videogamefranchise": ["Championship Manager/Football Manager"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "DOS"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Domark"], "description": "The End of 1994 Season Data Up-Date Disk was an end of season update disk that updated the game's database to reflect player and club changes for the end of 1993/94 season.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Championship Manager '93,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "84998": {"poll": [], "name": "Championship Manager Italia", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["EN/EU Amiga edition", "EN/EU DOS edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Championship Manager"], "videogametheme": ["Sports - Soccer"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Sports Interactive Limited"], "videogamefranchise": ["Championship Manager/Football Manager"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "DOS"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Domark"], "description": "The CM93/94 engine was the basis for Championship Manager Italia.
