In general, Tibet is arid, cold, and high altitude. There are agricultural societies in the southern portion of Tibet at lower altitudes, while herders (some with light farming due to irrigation) live in the higher altitudes. Their clothing must combat these environmental conditions while also being constrained by the natural resources for making clothing and armor. The herders of high altitude raise yaks, grow meager crops of barley thanks to irrigation, and harvest and trade salt from brine lakes.<br/><br/>However, there are groups of herders who can only herd, the land being so barren as to allow nothing else. These people rely on trade to provide for their other needs. People of the low highlands (around 10,000 ft. in altitude) raise sheep and goats and participate in more agriculture, even though they are considered ?mountain people? by their trading partners on the plains of the Ganges.<br/><br/>The natural materials for Tibetans are wool from yaks and sheep. Such wool is spindled into yarn and woven into clothing or pressed and beaten into felt. Ropes are made from yak hair, and yak leather is renowned for its durability in boots, tools, and containers. Tweed is made from sheep's wool, and clothes the farmers, who are living in comparatively warmer conditions than their yak-herding cousins, and they often use ox hide for their leather goods. In terms of military attire, leather from animals is always available, as is silver and other metals, used in the lamellar style of armoring. Fortunately, Tibet neighbors many cultural groups and have a long history of trade. Indian and Persian influences came from the south and west while silk was introduced into Tibetan society through contact with the Chinese.<br/><br/>Now that you have an idea of the challenges Tibetans are faced by their environment and the available materials, I hope you enjoy World Building Library: Tibetan Dress, Arms, and Armor.

Inside you will find several items of note, a few of minor power and a game-oriented grounding in the complex myth, legend and religion of the diverse sub-continent as it applies to the listed items.<br/><br/>Items are presented in two different ways. The first presentation is reserved for common items of folklore and legend. These items are usually less powerful than items of note and should be well within the reach of PC item creation.<br/><br/>The second method of presentation is reserved for items of note; the items wielded or used by the gods, heroes and heroines of Indian Myth. Each item of note is presented in three power levels. Following the Indian tradition of incarnation, aspects, and avatars the first presentation is the item as wielded/used by the original god/hero. These items will almost certainly be major artifacts. The avatar of an item is the first incarnation of the item; the reflection of the powerful real item. Avatar items are often major artifacts in their own right or perhaps minor artifacts. The last and least powerful presentation for items of note is the aspect item. These lesser incarnation items are usually minor artifacts or major magic items.<br/><br/>For role-playing reasons you may wish to use the concept of item incarnation to replace common OGC special effects if you desire to run a strongly Indian themed game. For instance, you may wish to call any flaming weapon a [weapon type] of Agni. Such naming conventions can have powerful resonance for campaign flavor.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the physical description of the item is not necessarily based upon historical myths. Detailed descriptions of mythic items are sorely lacking and even the most heralded items are rarely described as more than a well-made weapon of immense puissance. For instance, in the Mahabharata, Siva gives Arjuna the Pasupata (one of his most powerful weapons) and states that no one in all the three worlds [the Brahmic, Divine, and Demonic] is invulnerable to it. But just what exactly the pasupata is isn?t ever stated.

The following article is about how Tibetans view their gods and goddess, the metaphysical beings that affect their day to day reality. Although Tibet is predominately Buddhist, their variety of Buddhism is distinct from the form practiced in other parts of Asia. Tibetan Buddhism has roots in tantric traditions, utilizing magical or mystical elements in their rituals, such as the use of mandalas and mantras in their mediation and worship. Tantric traditions focus on the ritual power of the body, speech, and mind.<br/><br/>Other factors unique to Tibet also shaped Tibetan Buddhism: cultural influences from India, harsh living conditions of Tibet, the pervasive number of nomadic pastoralists in the Tibetan culture, and the absorption of Bon deities and beliefs. Bon was the predominant religion in Tibet before the introduction of Buddhism from India in the 7th century. Although Buddhist text arrived from India as early as 1st century, Buddhism did not take form until 774, when Guru Rinpoche merged tantric Buddhism with the local Bon religion, forming what is commonly called Tibetan Buddhism.<br/><br/>This article covers the pantheon of deities, many inherited from Bon tradition and interpreted through a Buddhist filter. The Tibetan metaphysical realm is swarming with spirits, both wrathful and benevolent. Placating gods through ritual offering, preemptively not offending gods through wrong action, and having a personal array of protective spirits and gods is the suggested method of living life in Tibet. They often classify their gods into categories or type, attaching the appropriate prefix or suffix to the name of the deity to denote classification. Other times they have unique gods and goddess, which have an anthropomorphized form as well as a general form found in nature. When the gods are offended, they can inflict conditions and diseases upon people. They can also possess individuals (see World Building Library: Tibetan Exorcisms).

Inside you will find several items of note, a few of minor power and a game-oriented grounding in the complex myth, legend and religion of the diverse sub-continent as it applies to the listed items.<br/><br/>Items are presented in two different ways. The first presentation is reserved for common items of folklore and legend. These items are usually less powerful than items of note and should be well within the reach of PC item creation.<br/><br/>The second method of presentation is reserved for items of note; the items wielded or used by the gods, heroes and heroines of Indian Myth. Each item of note is presented in three power levels. Following the Indian tradition of incarnation, aspects, and avatars the first presentation is the item as wielded/used by the original god/hero. These items will almost certainly be major artifacts. The avatar of an item is the first incarnation of the item; the reflection of the powerful real item. Avatar items are often major artifacts in their own right or perhaps minor artifacts. The last and least powerful presentation for items of note is the aspect item. These lesser incarnation items are usually minor artifacts or major magic items.<br/><br/>For role-playing reasons you may wish to use the concept of item incarnation to replace common OGC special effects if you desire to run a strongly Indian themed game. For instance, you may wish to call any flaming weapon a [weapon type] of Agni. Such naming conventions can have powerful resonance for campaign flavor.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the physical description of the item is not necessarily based upon historical myths. Detailed descriptions of mythic items are sorely lacking and even the most heralded items are rarely described as more than a well-made weapon of immense puissance. For instance, in the Mahabharata, Siva gives Arjuna the Pasupata (one of his most powerful weapons) and states that no one in all the three worlds [the Brahmic, Divine, and Demonic] is invulnerable to it. But just what exactly the pasupata is isn?t ever stated. Detailed physical descriptions of items are usually lacking and hence, any here are the creation of the author and you should feel free to substitute your own as you like.<br/><br/>At the end of the work is a list of any new magical attributes or new weapon types.<br/><br/>"}, "124958": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1442124.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Rafa\u0142 Cywicki", "Krzysztof Cywicki", "Krzysztof Hanusz"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Igor Myszkiewicz"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ku\u017ania Gier"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1442124_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Bluffing", "Negotiation", "Novel-based", "Real-time"], "description": "&quot;All Animal Comrades believe that 1984 was a great year for the Animal Farm&mdash;at least, the Ministry of Truth claims so...&quot;<br/><br/>1984: Animal Farm, a new game by the designers of Alcatraz: the Scapegoat, presents a dystopian reality in which animals have overthrown their human masters.

At the same time, it forces the players to form temporary alliances with their enemies and keep an eye on their friends. All this makes each round of the game abound in heated talks (both public and secret), pacts, promises, and betrayals.

It's been a millennium since the Armageddon. Deep in the Yucatan jungle, humanity has mutated, degenerated, and segregated into five clans: Jaguar, Snake, Monkey, Gar, and Bat. These clans now battle it out for dominance in the region, cooperating when it suits them and actively working against each other when the opportunity arises.<br/><br/>In 3012, players start the game with small decks of Scout cards, which provide gold to make purchases. Two piles of cards &ndash; an Ally deck and a Weapon deck &ndash; provide static cards to buy, with three cards from each deck always available to purchase each round. Cards that are not bought remain there for other players to buy. Two non-static Action decks &ndash; one with cheap cards, the other expensive &ndash; are also available, and at the start of your turn, you reveal one card from each of these two Action decks. You get the benefits of the Action cards you reveal, whether you buy them or not, and they're removed from play if you don't buy them.<br/><br/>When you have amassed enough combat skill through Allies, Weapons, and Action cards, you can attempt to prove your worth by facing a beast in four decks of Encounter cards, ranging from easy to very difficult.<br/><br/>Unlike most deck-building games, there are many points of interaction in 3012, so players are never out of the action! And you always get to refill your hand to its maximum size at the start of your turn, so you are never penalized for interacting during other players' turns.<br/><br/>The game ends when one of the Heroes reaches Level 5.

Much of her time is spent dealing with the Wildcats, a gang that is getting increasingly bold in their criminal activity. With the help of a vigilante named Roper, D'arci begins to believe that the Wildcats plan to take over Union City. As the Wildcats grow ever bolder, D'arci discovers that the gang is led by Mack Bane, a candidate for mayor of Union City. Eventually, the Wildcats attempt a hostile takeover of the city, which is finally repelled by D'arci, Roper and the police.<br/>Some time later, D'arci is investigating a particularly brutal murder. She discovers that the murder was committed by Bane's bodyguards, establishing a connection between Bane and the Wildcats. Soon after, he is arrested by D'arci and Roper in his out of town estate. Even from jail, Bane is able to direct the Wildcats, and D'arci and Roper are forced to deal with several more threats to the city. Later, Bane breaks out of jail and claims to be an Ancient Warlock. He uses his powers to summon a fire beast to destroy the city, but D'arci and Roper defeat it. Bane and the Wildcats flee to a sanctuary tower to fulfill a prophecy; before they can complete their ritual, D'arci and Roper use the tower's ventilation system to destroy Bane and the Wildcats.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>The game is a third person action-adventure game set in largely free-roaming maps. It also utilized a rather complex fighting system incorporating kicks, punches, throws and sliding tackles as well as two melee weapons; knives and baseball bats.

It is believed that in the end, the Aesir, eventually overcame and assimilated the Vanir.<br/><br/>The cosmology of Norse mythology places the earth, known as Midgard and is a circular disk, in the center of a concentric circle surrounded by sea. Across the sea is the home of the giants, Jotunheim, also known as Utgard. The gods&rsquo; home lies above Midgard in Asgard, which is connected by the rainbow bridge, Bifrost, which also connects to the World Tree, Yggdrasil. Hel lies below Midgard in Niflheim. After Odin created Midgard, he built Asgard, the home of the gods.

Some chronicle historical events, ensuring the preservation of a common legacy for future generations. Religious leaders record their patron deity&rsquo;s deeds, dogmas and traditions, proselytizing converts through the recitation of their god&rsquo;s words and actions. Civil authorities draft codes of law, establishing organized rules governing itself and its citizens. Wizards channel arcane energy onto the page, converting its mystical power into words. Professional writers entertain, educate and inspire others through a variety of diverse and unique mediums. Regardless of their motivations, the ideas expressed by writers influence society more than any other force.<br/><br/>In that vein, this supplement endeavors to provide players the opportunity to expand their characters&rsquo; horizons and abilities, not just by the might of the sword or the power of magic, but through the force of words. By mastering the nuances of language and sound, characters embark on a unique journey, attaining fame and wealth through creative ingenuity in addition to traditional adventuring skills. Of course, might and magic share the spotlight as well.<br/><br/>Ink &amp; Quill presents a number of diverse abilities, classes and items allowing characters to attain this goal. A host of new feats specializing on the use of language and sound supplement the arsenal of any character, regardless of her previous background.

(Revelations: The Demon Slayer in North America) was developed by Multimedia Intelligence Transfer and published by Atlus and is part of the Megami Tensei series. The game originally was released in Japan in 1992. On March 19, 1999, the game was remade with updated graphics for the Game Boy Color. This version would be localized for North America and released on August 27, 1999. Also, Sega released an identically-titled port of the game for the Game Gear. This is not to be confused with the sequel released exclusively on the Game Gear and titled Megami Tensei Gaiden: Last Bible Special.<br/> Megami Tensei Gaiden: Last Bible is a side-game (gaiden) of the Megami Tensei universe. The humans in this game can call on the power of Gaia. The main hero, El, learns the art of Gaia and must save the world from an evil Gaia master (called Gaia Meisters in the original Japanese version), assisted by his friends Kishe and Uranus. The world in which this game takes place is a borderline-prehistoric world with many towns being named after mythological or ancient cities such as Atlantis and Harappa. This is unlike the other Megami Tensei games, which are set in modern or a futuristic Japan.<br/> In a review for the game on IGN, Adam Cleveland awarded the game a 7 out of 10, noting that &quot;Although it's not perfect for everyone, it should appeal to those of us who are constantly keeping our eyes open for hand-held journies [sic] with tons of battles based on choosing from menus.&quot; Revelations currently holds a 76.67% on GameRankings.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Revelations: The Demon Slayer&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "124680": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Ingo Beck"], "poll": [], "name": "Braunschweig-Quiz", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Cities: Braunschweig (Lower Saxony, Germany)", "Country: Germany", "Grupello Quizes"], "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1381937_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Grupello Verlag"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1381937.png", "boardgameversion": ["Grupello Verlag Edition 2011"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Trivia"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Simple trivia game with questions related to the German city of Braunschweig.

Complete surprise was achieved and the Germans struck deep into Soviet territory. The Germans thought that the Soviets would fold like a house of cards.

All these factors are represented in an easy to learn target number system.<br/><br/>Also included are all ten original Awakening the Bear! scenarios as well as eleven new Frontier scenarios, five new Commanding Heights scenarios and a very flexible Partisan Road Point Buy scenario.

The game is easily learned, fast-playing, and above all it emphasizes story elements of the battle so that the narrative which emerges has a natural feel of a historical written account. Attention is focused on active units, and the full story of each activation is followed until a natural break point is reached, similar to the end of a paragraph in a historical memoir. The game turn has no fire phase, rally phase, etc., but instead, active units may fire, move, rout &amp; rally in any order as needed to develop their plan. Non-active units play an important role at all times, looking for opportunities to derail the active plan. Fireball Forward is playable on a kitchen table in one evening, and it's designed to challenge players with realistic tactical choices, resulting in a satisfying game for everyone.<br/><br/>"}, "124700": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Survivors of the Fire: Director's Screen Panels", "rpgdesigner": ["Matt Frisbee"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1310793.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Post Apocalypse)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Friz Games"], "rpg": ["Survivors of the Fire"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1310793_t.jpg", "description": "From Published Material<br/><br/>As the Director of Survivors of the Fire you're expected to have all the answers for your players!

They are both boardgames of abstract strategy.<br/><br/><br/>Variant I<br/><br/>Stapeldammen I has been reported to exist at least since the early 1960s, although it may be much older.<br/><br/>It is played on a 10&times;10 checkers board with 20 pieces each. The goal is to capture or block all pieces of the opponent. The usual rules of International Checkers apply, notably backwards capture and maximum capture.<br/><br/>But there are three exceptions:<br/><br/>     Whenever a checker is captured, it is put under the checker capturing. That way stacks are built. A stack belongs to the player who owns the topmost piece, and it moves accordingly. If a stack is captured, then only the topmost piece is removed and it is put at the bottom of the stack capturing.<br/>     There is no promotion. Pieces reaching the back rank stay there unless they can leave it by means of a backwards capture.<br/>     A stack can be captured several times in one capturing move, provided that the capturing stack has captured other pieces in between.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Draws appear to be impossible in Stapeldammen.<br/><br/>Stapeldammen was an inspiration for Emergo.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     <a target='_blank' href='http://www.mindsports.nl/' rel='nofollow'>http://www.mindsports.nl/</a> - (turn-based)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Variant II<br/><br/>Stapeldammen II was probably created by Tim ter Kuile in the late 1960s.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Stapeldammen II is played on a checkered board of 10x10 squares. The left corner square of White must be dark. Each player (either called &quot;White&quot; or &quot;Black&quot;) owns 20 men of his color, either light or dark ones. Initially these men are stacked in twos on the player's first two rows and thus forming stacks. Gameplay proceeds only on the dark squares.<br/><br/>Black starts. The pieces (single men and stacks alike) may move one square diagonally towards the opponent unto the adjacent square, if it is vacant, until they reach the opponent's back row, where they cannot move any longer (but still capture!). The man on top of a stack determines its ownership. It is not permitted to pass a move.<br/><br/>You can capture opponent's men, which are on diagonally adjacent squares by leaping over them. The piece performing the capture must land immediately beyond (similar to the short checkers leap) on a vacant square. It is allowed to jump forwards or backwards. Opponent's men that were leaped are taken immediately and are placed beneath the leaping piece so that stacks are formed or increased in height. If a stack is leaped only its upmost man is captured. Capturing must continue as long as possible and the sequence must be taken which captures most. A stack may only be leaped more than once in a turn if another man is captured in-between. Captures have priority over non-capturing moves.<br/><br/>The game ends when (at his turn) a player is unable to move. Each player receives as many points as he got men on the opponent's back row including opponent's men which are there under his control. Any men that are not on either player's back row are considered to be neutral and are not counted. The player who got more points wins. It is exceedingly rare that both players achieve the same number of points, which would result in a tie.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "8", "name": "Stapeldammen", "playingtime": "40", "boardgamemechanic": ["Point to Point Movement"], "average": "7.16667", "usersrated": "6", "boardgamefamily": ["Checkers"]}, "124717": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Joachim Stallecker"], "poll": [], "name": "Bodensee-Quiz", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Grupello Quizes"], "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1381960_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Grupello Verlag"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1381960.png", "boardgameversion": ["Grupello Verlag Edition 2011"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Trivia"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Simple trivia game with questions related to the lake of Bodensee situated in Germany, Switzerland and Austria near the Alps.

Who can face the panic that will herald the end of Crimlak?<br/><br/>'The Red Dragon Cult' is a Dungeonslayers adventure for characters of level 9 to 12. In addition to new magic items and monsters 'The Red Dragon Cult' offers an independent mechanism to track the unrest swelling daily on Crimlak's streets and to orchestrate the fatal events that will lead to the demise of the Dreiental.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "124738": {"rpgartist": ["Christian Alamy", "Oclair Albert", "Rafael Albuquerque", "Marlo Alquiza", "Kalman Andrasofszky", "Mahmud Asrar", "Michael Atiyeh", "Ramon F.

Ours is a brave new age, and as humanity hurtles into space and the future with an astonishing series of new advances every day, NBN and our affiliates are keeping pace, bringing you all the vid that's fit to view.<br/><br/>Android: Netrunner is an asymmetrical Living Card Game for two players. Set in the cyberpunk future of Android and Infiltration, the game pits a megacorporation and its massive resources against the subversive talents of lone runners.<br/><br/>Corporations seek to score agendas by advancing them. Doing so takes time and credits. To buy the time and earn the credits they need, they must secure their servers and data forts with &quot;ice&quot;. These security programs come in different varieties, from simple barriers, to code gates and aggressive sentries. They serve as the corporation's virtual eyes, ears, and machine guns on the sprawling information superhighways of the network.<br/><br/>In turn, runners need to spend their time and credits acquiring a sufficient wealth of resources, purchasing the necessary hardware, and developing suitably powerful ice-breaker programs to hack past corporate security measures. Their jobs are always a little desperate, driven by tight timelines, and shrouded in mystery. When a runner jacks-in and starts a run at a corporate server, he risks having his best programs trashed or being caught by a trace program and left vulnerable to corporate countermeasures. It's not uncommon for an unprepared runner to fail to bypass a nasty sentry and suffer massive brain damage as a result. Even if a runner gets through a data fort's defenses, there's no telling what it holds. Sometimes, the runner finds something of value. Sometimes, the best he can do is work to trash whatever the corporation was developing.<br/><br/>The first player to seven points wins the game, but not likely before he suffers some brain damage or bad publicity.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "French first edition", "German first edition", "Italian edition", "Japanese first edition", "Korean first

During the game you will have a character, a deck, and a discard pile. First you need at least 2 or more people to play and each person will need to have their own character card (a Robot, a Cowboy, or a Samurai), and deck, (the deck contains only 50 cards and is full of attacks, equipment, and modifiers). The objective of the game is to attack your opponents deck. You do this with your character card and cards you draw from your deck. You win when their deck is completely depleted. No matter how many people play you will always attack the person to your left, so until you get down to two players you cannot attack the person that attacked you.<br/><br/>Setting up to play is easy just place your character card next to your deck and your discard pile will go on the other side of your character. Flip a coin to see who goes first, then follow 3 easy steps. STEP 1 DRAW - On your turn DRAW a card from your deck and place it in front of your character card. STEP 2 ATTACK - Your character must ATTACK on your turn and will automatically defend your deck on your opponents turn. Total and resolve conflict damage. Follow any additional rules on the card. STEP 3 DISCARD - Now discard the card in play and put it into your discard pile, it is now your opponents turn and they follow the 3 easy steps.<br/><br/>"}, "124779": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1324612.jpg", "poll": [], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Folko Streese"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Edge Entertainment", "Fantasy Flight Games", "Giochi Uniti", "Stratelibri"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1324612_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Medieval", "Negotiation", "Novel-based"], "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>The House of Black and White introduces sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty different cards) that further enrich the &quot;Beyond the Narrow Sea&quot; cycle and its exploration of the people, places, and events of Essos.

Players answer questions to progress, and they receive checks as rewards. There are four decks of cards that the players use to learn about careers. The game comes with two sets of cards in each color. One set is designed for third and fourth graders, and the more difficult cards are designed for fifth and sixth graders. The four kinds of cards are as follows: 1. The Education and Skills cards help players learn about the importance of formal education and specific skills for various careers. 2. The What&rsquo;s It Like? cards teach players about what it&rsquo;s like to work in various careers. 3. The Good Career cards challenge players to match careers with interests and talents. 4. When a player picks a Guess My Career card, the player tries to get other players to guess the career by verbal descriptions and/or acting out the career.<br/><br/>Players also learn the importance of a college education for entering many careers, as well as beginning to think about job preferences, such as whether they want to work mainly on their own or with others.

The mineral riches of the thriving Moon colony inspired legions of hearty Earth citizens to seek their fortunes in space. Humble rockets probed the farthest reaches of the solar system in an eager quest for resources, and brave colonists forged homes wherever they could survive. Pioneer life was hard, but the men and women who worked and raised their families on those planets and asteroids had much to be proud of.<br/><br/>Then the rumors began &mdash; whispered tales of frontier abductions and sightings of mysterious creatures. By the time the secret invasion was exposed, the aliens were everywhere. Families had been stolen away by slavers from the stars, and the peace-loving survivors had no choice but to arm themselves and fight. Fight to stop the alien attacks! Fight to free the helpless abductees! Fight to throw the aggressors back into space and end forever their power to threaten humanity!<br/><br/>Thus was born the Rocket Patrol &ndash; an organization of brave and hearty women and men dedicated to defending humanity and taking the fight to the alien menace from the stars.<br/><br/>Space Cadets: Away Missions is a cooperative, scenario-based, tactical action game for 1-6 players, which is set in the Golden Age of science fiction. In this game, the third standalone title in the Space Cadets franchise of cooperative/team space-themed games from Stronghold Games, players take on the roles of adventurous human spacemen who explore UFOs, acquire Alien technology and fight hostile extraterrestrials.<br/><br/>Each turn, spacemen have three action points to spend on activities such as firing their atomic rifles, analyzing exotic equipment, or subduing the malicious Brain-in-a-Jar. When the spacemen are finished, the aliens take their turns by following simple movement and combat protocols; seven types of hostile aliens threaten the players, from the repulsive mind leeches to the rampaging titanic sentinels.<br/><br/>Space Cadets: Away Missions contains twenty scenarios linked in a campaign story. Each mission features different combinations of aliens on different spaceships, with hexagonal map tiles arranged to form flying saucers, rocket ships, space stations, etc. Cooperation, tactical planning and good dice are essential if the spacemen hope to overcome the relentless horde of little green men.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "7.60385", "name": "Space Cadets: Away Missions", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Modular Board", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["Space Cadets: Away Missions \u2013 Promo Cards", "Space Cadets: Away Missions \u2013 Promo Scenarios and Illustrations Book"], "usersrated": "477", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Aliens", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Solitaire Games", "Space Cadets"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["3.

The owner initially has tracks laid out in a living room, bedroom, attic, and kitchen. Completing certain challenges unlocks a further two; a greenhouse, and a game room. Twelve unique cars are available, with a number of them available only after completing challenges. The different cars have varying abilities with regard to speed, traction, and maneuverability, the last affecting the car's ability to perform stunts.<br/><br/>Control of the car on the track and stunts are performed with a few simple keyboard commands. On the track, you can steer your car left or right. The car will also jump through the air between sections of track, during which you can perform stunts. Stunts are an integral part of the game, as much as racing against the clock. As a car jumps between sections of track, you can make the car spin around any axis: barrel rolls, end-over-end, or 360's, in either direction and in combination as well. Successful stunts give the car a speed and traction boost as it lands, which helps improve the player's time, signalled with a vivid graphic of lightning bolt-like effects on the wheels. Failure to land correctly after a stunt results in a crash, which does not end the race, but it costs time.<br/><br/>Crashes may be caused by loss of control, particularly on curves and inaccurate landings after a jump (even when no stunts are attempted, cars tend to twist out of control while aloft.) Crashes may also result from different objects found on the tracks, including other cars; in two sequences, hazards are encountered off the track as the car passes through the walls between two mouse-holes, and across a billiard table. All crashes cost time, while the car is replaced on the track.<br/><br/>There are three distinct modes of play: Practice, where you can race through any available track to achieve best time; Championship, where you must complete each track in sequence within a certain time limit; and Custom, where you can construct your own track layouts. Gold, silver, and bronze medals are awarded for best times on the supplied tracks.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Hot Wheels Stunt Track Driver&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "124859": {"poll": [], "name": "Woody Woodpecker Racing", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Game Boy edition", "North American PlayStation edition", "North American Windows edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1314112.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Children's", "Driving"], "videogamefranchise": ["Woody Woodpecker"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Konami", "Syrox Developments, Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Racing"], "videogameplatform": ["Game Boy Color", "PlayStation", "Windows"], "usersrated": "1", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Konami"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1314112_t.jpg", "description": "From the Back of the Box<br/><br/>Woody and Friends battle it out to the finish line!<br/><br/>Prepare for the wildest ride of your life as Woody Woodpecker and 8 of his friends bring their brand of comic mischief to the raceways.

It was amazing to us was how strongly people felt about an issue of such limited importance.<br/><br/>So in the spirit of lively exchange, Cognizant Chance is proud to present At Death&rsquo;s Door.

One is as the Crystalmancer core class, much akin to the wizard, and the other as a prestige class for the wizards and sorcerers who wish to head down the road of crystalmancy. Also in chapter 1 are two new feats for all spellcasters, but most suited for crystalmancers and all other information on making crystalmancer characters.<br/><br/>Chapter 2 introduces a collection of new spells that have been crafted and discovered by crystalmancers in the past, but are just as easily used by other arcane spellcasters. Chapter 3 shows the true power that is at a crystalmancer's disposal: magic items. Avariety of minor, medium, major, and artifact level items are found in this chapter, all of which could easily be found in any campaign setting, doubly so in the presence of crystalmancers.<br/><br/>In chapter 4 introduces the surreal Plane of Crystal. Also known as the crystalline realm, it is a small world that is oddly similar to a normal world, yet everything is made of solid, multi-colored crystal. This chapter outlines the physical traits of the plane and provides information on several key locations and personalities, as well as tips on adventures to run in conjunction with this plane. Also found in chapter 4 are the Crystal Keepers. The Crystal Keepers are an organization of good-natured crystalmancers that try to extend the reach of the crystal path.

The factions begin in their respective base hub on the outskirts of the island.  Quickly, they must build their ranks and establish their perimeters to begin the conquest of their adversaries. Their goal is to acquire the Mojos of their opponents and secure more territories on the island.  Factions not only have their own set of specific cards to aid them in their conquest, they also have a random faction force that enables them to have a unique edge over their foes.   To complicate matters and add an element familiar to any survivalist, there is a good chance that chaos will enter the fray.

The eight &quot;Instant Dishes&quot; among the action cards allow players to lock in a common ingredient and score 1 point.<br/>  <br/>Players can score a &quot;cuisine bonus&quot; for making multiple dishes from one of the five primary cuisines featured on dish cards (American, Continental, French, Italian and Mexican). The first player to reach a point threshold, which depends on the number of players, wins.<br/><br/>In the team version, players end the round and total their points when the Action card deck has been exhausted.<br/><br/>Raid the Pantry is the winner of the New Zealand New Game of the Year 2013 award from the New Zealand Games Association.

The players do this by flicking planets across the board and utilizing gravitational fields to move the planets around each other and the suns.  Players must also be wary of the black-hole in the center of the board that can swallow up the planets left within its gravity field.  The game relies upon a mix of skill and strategy creating exciting shots and chin scratching moments.<br/><br/>Intelligent Design is played on a board with a hexagonal grid.  The grid has 6 solar systems centered on each sun and a black-hole in the center space.  Each player has a set of 10 planets and 2 score tokens in a color that matches the color of a solar system and grid edge.  The planets each have a number between 1 and 8 printed on them and come in three different sizes.  The number on the planet indicates the mass of the planet and its ability to orbit(moving adjacent) planets with smaller numbers.  Each player will take turns flicking and orbiting planets on the board attempting to get as many planets into the Goldilocks Zone of their sun.  The planets are worth an amount of victory points based upon their size with the smallest(and most vulnerable) planets worth the most and the largest worth the least.  Players will have the opportunity to score the planets in the Goldilocks Zone of their sun three times during the course of the game, twice by using score tokens on their turn and again during final scoring.

IMPORTANT. All three base games are required for this module.<br/><br/>Kabinettskrieg is a multi-player operational study, for 2-6, or even more would-be generals; each player controls the forces of one of the major participating nations and its minor allies. Extra players can lead the troops of the same nation in individual theatres of the war. Although the players are divided into two Camps, victory is an individual goal as you try to win more glory than both your allies and your enemies. Do YOU have what it takes to become the greatest captain general of the Eighteenth Century?<br/><br/>Included in the module is a set of the latest basic rules, charts, and tables (version 3.75) for the Lace Wars system. A few key concepts in this system include Operations Points, Campaign Plans, Prestige, and Auxiliaries. Operations Points are accumulated during periods of inactivity, in order to be spent during the course of active campaigning. If a player is unable or unwilling to spend OPs, his forces suffer attrition instead. The further forces are from their base of operations, the more severe the penalties will be. Whoever has the most OPs also has the initiative.<br/><br/>Map scale is 8.5 miles per hex. The counters are battalions and regiments. Units are rated for Strength (in battalions), Effectiveness (a combination of morale and training), and Movement. Turns are equivalent to months. Each turn is broken down into several phases - supply, operations, admin, etc.<br/><br/>The heart of the game is the Operations Phase, where the players alternate moving their formations, laying siege to fortresses and engaging in battle with the enemy field forces. The players have a degree of flexibility in what they do with their forces, but they are constrained by the Campaign Plan or plans that they choose. These dictate what objectives (usually fortresses) must be taken. A successfully completed plan will garner Prestige for a player. At the end of the game, the player with the highest prestige wins. In addition, bonuses can be won for victory in battle, and these may be used to buy rewards that improve a player's chances, or be used as influence.<br/><br/>Leaders have an important role to play, as befitting an era where personal command was critical. They are rated for skill or effectiveness, personality, and influence (i.e. the chance they have of retaining command despite their incompetence).<br/><br/>In addition to the concepts above, the supply system has been streamlined while keeping to the basic elements of foraging in tandem with the use of pre-positioned depots. River and canal movement has been taken into account and will prove as critical to success as the use of rail lines in more modern games.<br/><br/>The combat system has a tactical feel - while not a full sub-system with battlefield maps, it addresses the key issues of frontage, reserves, and supports, as well as firepower and morale. Winning a battle will bring you the acclaim of your noble peers, but may not gain you any strategic advantage; losing a battle can be catastrophic.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Red Sash Boxed Edition"], "average": "6.5", "name": "Kabinettskrieg", "playingtime": "10", "boardgamemechanic": ["Simulation"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["Cockpit of Europe", "Queens' Gambit: The War in Italy, 1742-1748", "Sport of Kings: Germany 1740-45"], "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": ["Age of Kings", "Lace Wars"]}, "124921": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgseries": ["Pick \u2018n' Mix"], "name": "Genja Kesh", "rpgdesigner": ["Ryan Nock"], "rpgproducer": ["Ryan Nock"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1314398.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["EN Publishing"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1314398_t.png", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>Trained as infiltrators, deal-brokers, and assassins, the Genja Kesh represent the dark face of an oppressed elven people.

They embrace both the divine mysteries of their deity&rsquo;s embrace and the full glory of their own psionic powers of the mind, often seeing no difference between the two, as the powers of the mind and will are there only because of the will of the deity in question. Mind priests tend to be very driven clerics, those who are driven to exemplify the divine power of the mind as well as the divine magical gifts of their deity.<br/><br/>In the pantheons of the mind, there is the essential duality of power broken between the powers of divine magic, granted by petitioning the gods themselves for power, and the power of psionics, powers granted and unlocked by the gods in all those who can manifest such aptitudes. Yet both are the gift of the godminds, and thus the driven mind priests have worked to enmesh the two studies together.<br/><br/>Only characters who have training both in the arts of the mind and the worship of the divine can become mind priests. Cleric / Psion is the most common class combination, but requires both a high Intelligence and Wisdom. Thus, a fair number of mind priests are Clerics / Psychic Warriors (although they suffer from the low hit die) and there are also some Druid mind priests. As many Clerics have a high Charisma as religious and community leaders, Cleric / Wilder multiclasses are also well represented within the ranks of the mind priests. While the class also works for Paladin / Psychic Warriors, there are very few who follow these paths within the ranks.<br/><br/>Many of the most potent mind priests go on to take levels of thrallherd to secure their position of power in the church and the temporal world.
