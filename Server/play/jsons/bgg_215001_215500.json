It is an unofficial, enhanced remake of Nintendo's Game Boy game Metroid II: Return of Samus (1991), borrowing the art style and overall feeling of the Game Boy Advance game Metroid: Zero Mission (2004). Shortly after the game's release, Nintendo sent DMCA notices to websites hosting AM2R; download links to the game were removed from its official website, but Guasti said that he still planned to continue working on the game privately. In September 2016, Guasti ended the development of AM2R after he received a DMCA takedown request from Nintendo.<br/><br/>The game follows Samus Aran, who aims to eradicate the parasitic Metroids from their home planet SR388. It includes several new features, including redone graphics and music, a map system, and new areas and minibosses. The controls were changed to be more rigid, in line with the gameplay of later titles in the series. Video game journalists appreciated the game, frequently calling it impressive and commenting on the improved visuals compared to those of the original Metroid II, although one noted the win conditions in Metroid battles as being too precise considering how often they occur. The game was nominated for The Game Awards 2016, but was later removed from the nominations page without notice.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AM2R AM2R]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "215125": {"poll": [], "name": "Hello Neighbor", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1296438.png", "videogametheme": ["Horror"], "videogamegenre": ["Stealth"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Dynamic Pixels"], "videogamefranchise": ["(Unreleased Games - Unavailable)"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["tinyBuildGAMES"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1296438_t.png", "description": "Hello Neighbor is a Stealth Horror Game about sneaking into your neighbor's house and figuring out what he's hiding in the basement.

Yet, while vast sums of wealth are being traded back and forth, amongst the few, the vast bulk of the population out in the Fringe lives in abject poverty, sometimes even in slavery.<br/><br/>Vast fortunes existing with little law and oversight mixed with a dash of abject poverty for the many - it is a heady mixture. And one of the things that mixture produces is piracy. The allure of seizing a wealthy cargo and becoming instantly rich (or at least well-off for a time) succors many. And if they make the attempt, and survive the results, the dream can even become true. (Until the day the Star Marshals come knocking on your door, of course.)<br/><br/>While pirates are commonly known for being an independent lot, in actuality, a surprisingly large amount of the piracy that occurs is sponsored piracy.  Of this, the most common type is corporate piracy - pirates given a free hand to seize as much as they can grab of all assets of the sponsor's rivals (whether rivals corporate, government, or civilian). And since in the Fringe, the corporations are oft the most sizable force of law in the region, not the government, that can wind up being a very free hand indeed. As long as you are caught somewhere where the sponsor has influence, that is, and not somewhere controlled exclusively by a rival power.<br/><br/>These corporate privateers may, from time to time, be tasked by the sponsor with seizing a particular cargo, but they are mostly given free reign to act as they normally would as pirates, except with an extremely favored list of people to hit (and a list of friends not to hit), with bonus pay for hitting certain targeted goals, such as taking X amount from a certain corporate rival and their agents.<br/><br/>However, privateers are far from the only pirates operating within the Fringe. On the other side of things are those awful individuals that have given piracy its feared reputations - the most depraved, the most foul in their deeds and action. Slavers, killers and kidnappers, these pirates are well-known for boarding ships in the deeps of space and raping, torturing, and killing all on board. They prey on small trade ships and transports, but have also been known to raid outlying outposts and colonies with equally brutal force and carnage. There are countless bands of these pirates, some as small as a few hard individuals, or as large as the Pirate Lords of the outer belts, with thousands of blackguards and hundreds of ships within their company. Some of these Pirate Lords have made such a name for themselves that they are even known by the common citizens back on the Core Worlds. Names such a Black-Eyed Pete and the pirate queen Morgan the Red-Handed. Others, though, are just nameless killers and raiders, seeking a quick path to riches within the backdrop of the hard life within the hard part of the galaxy that is the space frontier.<br/><br/>"}, "215130": {"rpgartist": ["Robert Hemminger"], "rpg": ["One Knight Games"], "poll": [], "name": "Derby Duels", "rpgdesigner": ["A.

In some cases, this might be by doing good works or engaging in meaningful prayer, but in the darkest of times, indulgences were sold to anyone willing to make a significant &quot;contribution&quot;. As the rising families of the Italian Renaissance conspired and plotted to seize control, the indulgence offered a clear conscience for many a questionable deed committed in the name of power.<br/><br/>Indulgence is a trick-taking game for 3-4 players. On their turn, players choose an edict that gives the rule for the hand. The other players then decide if they want to violate the edict by doing the opposite of what it commands. So &quot;Don&rsquo;t take any Medicis&quot; suddenly becomes &quot;I must take all the Medicis&quot;. Committing a sin can be challenging, but a player attempting it gets the benefit of the indulgence, a token that turns one of their cards into a winning hand. Can you trick your opponents into committing sins without the indulgence? Can you avoid sinning yourself? Whoever can pull that off will end up with a pile of gems and the title of victor.<br/><br/>Ingulgence is a restoration of Dragonmaster, originally published by Milton Bradley in 1981 and designed by Jerry D'Arcey. It was itself a reimagining of D'Arcey's prior game, Coup d'Etat, and its classic progenitor Barbu. Dragonmaster enjoyed lavish production, with oversized cards, art by the incomparable Bob Pepper, and some nifty interlocking gems for keeping score. In addition to the retheming, the restoration evens out the game play. The original game suffered from a runaway leader problem in which an early power play with the dragon card all but assured one player's elimination from contention and gave the other a big leg up. The indulgence token replaces the dragon card to make it more accessible, less powerful, and easier to understand. It also increases the number of contracts from 5 to 20, and ups the deck to 36 cards.<br/><br/>Components<br/>36 tarot-sized family cards (nine cards, numbered 1 through 9, in each of four families)<br/>20 double-sided tarot-sized edict cards<br/>1 edict deck cover plaque<br/>4 Papal Bull cards<br/>20 gems of various colors<br/>26 florin tokens<br/>4 strongbox cards<br/>1 Indulgence ring (yes, a legit ring)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "name": "Indulgence", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Trick-taking"], "average": "5.5", "usersrated": "3", "age": "14"}, "215309": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["DOC Version 1.0"], "rpgseries": ["INT - Living Greyhawk Introductory Adventures", "Living Greyhawk", "SHL - Living Greyhawk Shield Lands Regional Adventures", "SHL7 - Shield Lands Season Seven"], "name": "A Few Bad Apples", "rpgdesigner": ["Melissa Kocher", "Lee O.

Frantic bets placed in secret even as the cars race around the track. And to the victor, the biggest purse of all. But in the world of motor racing, the margin between victory and defeat can be a single moment: a steep banked turn, tires screaming and spitting out smoke, and the downforce, pressing you down in your seat and keeping you on the track as you make your move inside to pull ahead.<br/><br/>Downforce is a card-driven bidding, racing, and betting game for 2-6 players based on Top Race, the award-winning design by the legendary Wolfgang Kramer. Players first bid to own the six cars in the race, then they play cards from their hand to speed them around the track. However, most cards will also move their opponents' cars. So figuring out just the right time to play a card is the key to victory. Along the way, players make secret bets on who they think will win the race. Whoever has the most money from their prize money, winning bets, and remaining bank wins.<br/><br/>This is a game whose design needed no attention. Years of play and multiple versions have honed it to near perfection. On the contrary, one of the design challenges was figuring which of the many rules modules to incorporate to create the most fun version. Downforce also adds variable player powers to improve replayability. But mostly, it improves the look of the game to make it gorgeous and easy to play.

Get enough reward money, and you can finally leave this rat race behind and retire to a sunny tropical beach in the Caribbean.<br/><br/>Stop Thief is a family game of logical deduction for 2-4 players. An invisible suspect commits a crime. Only the sounds they make give them away. Listen to the clues and figure out where they are hiding.

Next step was ditching the roll-and-move mechanism and, in general, stripping out some of the luck and adding in a healthy dose of strategy. By replacing the dice with decks of movement cards, it also allows asymmetrical decks, which increases the fun and replayability.

You won't kill me out of some misplaced sense of self -righteousness, and I won't kill you because you are to much fun. I think you and I are destined to do this forever? - The Joker<br/><br/>The Joker is one of Batman's oldest and greatest foes. A mirror of the Bat himself, the Joker stands for everything Batman is against. Chaos, disorder and crime without reason.<br/><br/>Possibly one of Batman's greatest failures when the Red Hood fell into a vat of chemicals, the Joker has plagued Batman, his allies and Gotham City ever since.<br/><br/>Nobody knows who he really is and even the Joker himself has told several different origin stories. If he's going to have one, he would prefer it to be multiple choice.<br/><br/>Seeing murder, chaos and his 'dance' with Batman as one big joke, the Joker is one of the most dangerous men Batman has ever faced. Using countless resources including his own Joker Gas, he tries to take down Gotham and 'Batsy' again and again. Only to end up each time in Arkham Asylum.<br/><br/>During one stay in Arkham, the Joker met Dr. Harleen Quinzel. A psychiatrist that developed an obsession with the Joker that led her to become Harley Quinn and follow her 'puddin' on his journey of insanity.<br/><br/>Some of the Jokers worst crimes include paralysing Barbara Gordon / Batgirl and killing Batman's own sidekick Jason Todd / Robin. Batman has sworn not to kill, but can the Joker push him over the edge?<br/><br/>Using a Joker crew in the Batman Miniatures Game is to bring chaos to the table.<br/><br/>A dangerous man in his own right with weapons like a poisoned knife, one shot gun and explosive teeth, the Jokers true strength comes from his ability to change his crews plans at the last minute with the use of Kaos Agent. This means your opponent can never really know what you are going to do until it's too late.<br/><br/>Having Harley Quinn as a Sidekick can help with the mass chaos as she can even change your opponents plans while her True Love for the Joker means she can become very dangerous if her 'puddin' is taken down. Or if you need some muscle instead, Mr Hammer is happy to help.<br/><br/>The Jokers Clown Henchmen are very basic fighters all armed with a range of different weapons. They are easy to take down one by one, but being cheap to hire, there can be enough on the table to pull off any crime. There are also a few Elite Clowns if you want some Henchmen that are a bit more resilient and hit harder.<br/><br/>The Joker crew has access to all sorts of Free Agents to help them out. Killer Croc adds some serious muscle to the crew when it's needed and is quick to move around to where he is needed via the sewers. Scarecrow can help keep the insanity under control while also messing with the opponents plans further by forcing models to activate first.<br/><br/>Overall, the Joker crew is great for anyone to play. Kaos Agent makes it easy on new players while messing with your opponents plans can be fun for more experienced players.<br/><br/>Contains:<br/><br/>4 metal miniatures:<br/>- Joker<br/>- Clown<br/>- Ringmaster<br/>- Contra-Auguste<br/>Stat cards for the characters<br/><br/>"}, "215320": {"poll": [], "name": "Batman Miniature Game: Penguin's Crew", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Dice Rolling", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2012", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Comics: DC Universe"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3302876_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Knight Models"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3302876.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Comic Book / Strip", "Expansion for Base-game", "Miniatures", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Wargame"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "&quot;Ahh... the Batman. While I have an affection for most flying creatures... the winged rat is not among them.&quot; - The Penguin<br/><br/>Oswald Cobblepot, known as Penguin to most of Gotham, is one of the best villainous businessmen around. If you want a weapon, he has it. Want someone taken care of, he knows the perfect person to call.<br/><br/>Cobblepot started life teased as a child because of his short stature and bird-like nose earning him the nickname 'penguin' and when his father died of pneumonia, his mother made him carry an umbrella wherever he went which did not help with the rest of the worlds view of him. This led to Oswald becoming a nasty, resentful person that wanted to prove he could be better than those around him while he was growing up.<br/><br/>Cobblepot has a genius level intellect, amazing business sense, he's a tactical mastermind, oddly skilled fighter for his build and has obsessions with birds and his trusty umbrellas.<br/><br/>All of this has made him into the Penguin that now runs most of the crime in Gotham.<br/><br/>The Penguin can out-plan and out-think his opponents with ease but if things ever go wrong he has an entire arsenal of trick umbrellas to fall back on. Everything from guns and grapples to gas, hypnosis and even one that can fly.<br/><br/>His plans, schemes and crimes are often run using money from his legitimate businesses like the Iceberg Lounge and Iceberg Casino. If he needs help, he won't shy away from hiring the best in the world but only if he thinks he will come out better off in the end.<br/><br/>In the Batman Miniatures Game, the Penguin crew is all about money, resources and using them as best as you can to get the job done.<br/><br/>Oswald himself much more dangerous than he looks. Armed with an Umbrella Cannon and Umbrella Blade, he can dish out a lot of damage when he needs to and even has a bulletproof vest under his fine jacket for extra protection. He real strength though is getting his crew and others to do the work for him.<br/><br/>Penguin is Charismatic and a Lord of Business so can hire more Free Agents than most, better equip his own men and even take extra Loot Objectives.<br/><br/>The Penguin thugs are cheap but that also makes them numerous. Throw enough men at a problem and it can be solved. The Penguins extra equipment reserves let him arm his hordes well though. Assault Rifles, Automatic Guns and Grenades are not uncommon to see in the middle of the Thugs.<br/><br/>If the hulking Sickle joins him as a Sidekick, he can also bring along some more Elite Penguin Thugs when the extra skill is wanted.<br/><br/>Instead of hordes of Thugs, Penguin also has the options of hiring almost any Free Agent he needs with his Charisma and $$$ letting him choose people like Deadshot and Deathstroke on a regular basis as deadly assassins.<br/><br/>A couple of very good choices though are Catwoman and Mr Freeze.

The Crematorium. Inferno. These are among the names that have been ascribed to the Elemental Plane of Fire, one of the most exotic, dangerous, and misunderstood of all the planes of existence. Home to the fabled City of Brass, the trading hub of the planes and the seat of power of the mighty efreet, the Elemental Plane of Fire also houses the ashen wastes, a massive continent of soot and ash inhabited with the ancient ghosts of the lost azer empire, the lava seas, vast oceans of liquid rock traversed by huge galleons made of volcanic rock, and much more.<br/><br/>This book presents the Elemental Plane of Fire as a campaign setting for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook. The first section of the book provides rules for creating player characters and NPCs of the four main races that inhabit the plane: azer, efreet, fire elementals, and salamanders. As in the critically-acclaimed Liber Vampyr: Secrets of the Blood by Necromancers of the Northwest, each of these races is presented as a race suitable for a player character, rather than what is found in their bestiary entry, as well as a 20-level base class that allows characters of that race to unlock their full potential. The book also includes over 50 feats that allow characters to unlock additional fire-based or racial powers.<br/><br/>Following this is a detailed look at the Elemental Plane of Fire itself, from the magical and supernatural effects that pervade the plane, to special environmental hazards only found here, and expanded rules for managing the size, spread, and intensity of fire on any plane, as well as a 40-page gazetteer of the Elemental Plane of Fire&rsquo;s five main regions: the City of Brass, the ashen wastes, the lava seas, the plain of burning coals, and the treacherous volcanic range known as the teeth of Soraak.<br/><br/>Whether you want to set a whole campaign in the Plane of Fire, or just a single adventure, or even if you just want to play an azer, efreet, fire elemental, or salamander in a game set in a less exotic locale, this book brings the Elemental Plane of Fire to life in a way that you haven&rsquo;t seen before.

There's a confluence of all kinds of factors along lines of race, gender and politics that haven't been as important or as visible as they are now since the 1980s. Racism &ndash; in all directions &ndash; rears its ugly head in part because of increasing poverty, in part because people seem to want things to be bad so that they have something meaningful to fight. Relativism and postmodern thinking appears to hold sway in much academic discourse, even redefining the very meanings of terms like 'racism' and 'sexism' to excuse the hypocrisy of many who prosecute those agendas.<br/><br/>Horror is often a good place to explore 'what ifs' and to challenge dominant paradigms.<br/><br/>What if, for example, there were such a thing as an inferior culture? What if there were such a thing as a primitive culture? What if there was a savagery that wasn't noble? What if there were people that didn't give a damn about 'white saviours' with social justice degrees. Who did set up their own parallel societies and laws.<br/><br/>What if every idiotic, paranoid fantasy the xenophobic right ever had about immigrants were embodied in one terrifying instance.<br/><br/>This adventure for Blood! is a sort of urban 'Green Inferno' or 'Cannibal Holocaust' meets 'The Raid'.

Each subsequent player can either pass or play a higher set of cards of cards, but a set that includes at most one card more than what was played most recently. Once all players pass, the cards in the center are removed from play, and whoever played most recently leads in the new round.<br/><br/>When a player runs out of cards, the round ends and players score points for the cards they've collected. Players play three rounds, then whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>"}, "215456": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3316914.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ray Tapio"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "12", "boardgamepublisher": ["Critical Hit, Inc."], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3316914_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>KESTERNICH, BELGIUM, 14 December 1944: The First Battle for Kesternich took place from December 14 to 16, 1944. This battle pitted the 2nd Battalion of the 309th Infantry Regiment and the 2nd Battalion of the 310th Infantry Regiment of the 78th Infantry Division against units from the 272nd Volksgrenadier Division, including elements of the 326th Volksgrenadier Division. This attack was part of a greater attack by the First Army's V Corps in an effort to capture the Roer River Dams that included the 78th Infantry Division as well as the 2nd Infantry Division to the south. The attack by the 78th Division interrupted Hitler's plans for the northern shoulder of the Bulge.<br/><br/>The recent release of Battle of the Twin Villages got your boots into the snow. Now you're going to have to slog forward, if you are the Volksgrenadier player .. or hold on ... if the Americans. Because the dates are 14-16 December 1944. And that means the height of ferocity of Hitler's last gamble, aka 'Wacht Am Rhein' has been unleashed. And every village, every road crossing, where a stand is made can make the difference between a drive to Antwerp, or a final, crushing blow to the tyrant's dreams as he hunkers in his lair.

Once you have a highway, you can possibly place one of your ten cars on it.<br/><br/><br/>Description:<br/><br/>Goal of the Game<br/><br/>You must construct a highway and place all your cars on the highway by crossing your opponent&rsquo;s roads. The first player to place all 10 cars is the winner.<br/><br/>Playing the Game<br/><br/>You have three things to do during your turn.<br/><br/>\u2460 Constructing a pillar<br/>Pick a location to construct a pillar.<br/>You may freely choose the construction point as long as your pillar is reachable from the base point. A base point is the location of a pillar or junction constructed in previous turn. The height of the pillar must be 1 above or 1 below the base point. You may not construct a pillar of the same height, 2 stories above or below the height of a base point (following is an exception - 6. Constructing a Junction).<br/><br/>\u2461 Constructing a road<br/>A new road must rest between the base point and the pillar constructed in phase \u2460.<br/>You may adjust the position of the pillar when placing a road.<br/><br/>\u2462 Placing cars on highway <br/>When conditions are met, you may place a car on the road (Refer to &ndash; 5. Conditions for Car Placement).<br/>Your turn ends with your opponent&rsquo;s judge. <br/>If there is a problem, it must be sorted out on the spot.<br/><br/>Game goes on repeating \u2460 to \u2462 alternately.<br/>You may no longer adjust the position of your pillar, road or car once your opponent constructs a new pillar.<br/><br/>Conditions for Car Placement<br/><br/>The chance to place a car on the highway occurs only to the newest road you construct. To place a car,  your newest road must cross your opponent&rsquo;s road. There are two ways to cross your opponent&rsquo;s road: crossing over or crossing under it.<br/><br/>When crossing over : <br/>there exist no other roads over opponent&rsquo;s road<br/><br/>When crossing under : <br/>there exist no other roads under opponent&rsquo;s road<br/><br/>When either of the conditions is met, you may place a car on the highway. If not, you may not place a car but may still connect the road to the next pillar.<br/><br/>If the road crosses multiple roads, you may place multiple cars depending on the number of roads crossed.<br/><br/>crossing over two roads at the same time<br/>crossing over and crossing under two roads at the same time<br/><br/>\u3010Caution\u3011<br/>\u30fb You may not place a car when crossing over/under your own road.<br/>\u30fb You may not place a car on already constructed roads later on in the game.<br/>Keep the traffic rules and enjoy driving!<br/><br/>Constructing a Junction<br/>The yellow pillar is called the junction. Using a junction, you may do the following.<br/><br/>\u2460 Increase or decrease the height of the pillar by any number<br/>You may increase or decrease the height of your pillar regardless of the height of the pillar at the base point. However, you need to have at least one gray pillar under the junction. You may only construct a pillar of one more or less stories as usual in the following turn.<br/><br/>Be careful, if the road angle is too steep you&rsquo;ll have trouble placing cars!<br/><br/>\u2461 Branching out to two-ways<br/>You may branch out your highway from a junction anytime during the game.<br/><br/>Constructing Exit to Highway<br/><br/>If you can ground a road safely to the table, you have created an exit to your highway. You may place an additional car as a bonus point on the exit road. If the road crosses your opponent&rsquo;s road(s) while grounding, you may place multiple cars on the road. You can not start a new road from the exit.<br/><br/>Penalty<br/><br/>If you drop your opponent&rsquo;s car or road during construction, you must hand over your pillars to your opponent as penalty. You must offer a number of pieces equivalent to the materials you dropped. Game proceeds only after the parts are fixed by the player responsible. There is no penalty for dropping your own pieces.<br/><br/>End of the Game<br/><br/>1. When all 10 cars are placed on the highway<br/>The first player to finish all 10 cars is the winner.<br/><br/>2. When construction materials run out<br/>If you are out of construction materials, you must wait for your opponent to finish the next turn. If the opponent finishes the turn with no penalty, the player with no more construction materials is the loser.<br/><br/>"}, "215465": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3311703.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Tyrell R.

It is the only game that covers the specific battles that took place between the Schmalkaldic League of Confessors (the Lutherans) and the Catholic League (Holy Roman Empire) between the years 1532-1555. The setting of League of Confessors begins after the death of John the Steadfast as the leaders of the Augsburg Confession prepare to defend themselves against the impending armies of the Holy Roman Empire. Power and wealth will collide with conviction and courage as two leagues of heroes go to war with sword and the pen!<br/><br/>League of Confessors comes with 4 different classes of heroes.<br/><br/>Commanders &ndash; Commanders are the heroes that initially lead your entire army. They are good leaders in battle and are very versatile.<br/><br/>Generals &ndash; Generals are good leaders in battle, but that is all they will do. They can advance in their battle abilities very quickly.<br/><br/>Princes &ndash; Princes will help build the infrastructure of your expanding territory through the construction of armories, castles, or churches.<br/><br/>Confessors &ndash; Confessors do not have the ability to lead troops in battle. They are the only heroes who have the ability to publish confessional writings to convert opponents to their side.<br/><br/>The goal is to win the game by gaining seven Conquest Points. Each electorate territory is worth 1 Conquest Point (CP). The other way you can gain a CP is to fully advance a hero in their abilities. If you fully advance a hero in their abilities, you will also gain 1 CP for as long as that hero is alive. If your league has seven or more Conquest Points at the end of one of your turns, you win the game!<br/><br/>"}, "215008": {"poll": [], "name": "Blood Bowl (2016 edition): The Skavenblight Scramblers", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2016", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "37", "boardgamefamily": ["Blood Bowl"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3386457_t.jpg", "average": "7.80568", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Citadel UK", "Games Workshop Ltd."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3386457.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Miniatures", "Sports"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "A Skaven expansion team with an out-of-the-box team value of 1,000,000 gold pieces.

The chancellor position is valuable as each of these major actions can only be taken once per round.<br/><br/>As each major action taken, the other players have minor actions that can be chosen - Move, Build, Upgrade, and Attack. These actions are very quick and there will be many of them, giving players something minor to do when it is not their turn.<br/><br/>Points are earned throughout this process and the first player to reach 18 is the winner!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "12", "name": "Quest for Gaia", "playingtime": "150", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Area Movement", "Partnerships", "Variable Player Powers", "Voting"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["4X games", "Admin: Unreleased Games"]}, "215030": {"poll": [], "name": "Redie", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "description": "Redie is a challenging singleplayer 3D top-down shooter.
