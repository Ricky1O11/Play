On the last day of your mission, your shuttle was destroyed. This left you stranded on a planet that is about to be transformed, killing you but terraformimg humanity's new home.

Each Pilot and Robot has its own deck of Attack and Instant cards. Choose 15 of them to build your hand.

You never draw cards from a deck, so the combos and combat cycles you design are always at your fingertips. Every time your opponent moves, plays a card, or resolves a dice roll, you can respond and counter with cards of your own. The battle is constant, dramatic, and engaging&mdash;you never have to wait for your turn to get in on the action.<br/><br/>COLLATERAL DAMAGE  <br/>Every piece of terrain is fully destructible, revealing new hazards as you smash through the city.

Players chose a bid and place it face down in the ready position. When everyone is ready the bids are simultaneously revealed. The bids&rsquo; colors signify what you are bidding on. Red bids recruit gangsters with unique abilities, green bids buy various types of Contraband (worth victory points), and blue bids bribe the Cop, which protects your points and forces the competition to lose theirs. After 3 rounds the highest bidder for a given color wins the corresponding prize. Players take their winnings and reset the board for the next hand.<br/><br/>Player interaction comes from the actions on the lower numbered bid cards. Actions allow you to steal your rivals contraband, assassinate their mercenaries, and put the odds in your favor.<br/><br/>Each gangster has their own unique ability that is active throughout the entire game. Depending on which gangsters you recruit, different strategies will become available. For example, the Mob Boss gives you an additional Victory Point for each Gangster on your team, this card pairs well with the Recruiter who gives you a permanent +2 to your red bid total.

(Climb ON!) is a Japanese board game produced by the doujin circle Kichikichian.<br/><br/>Climb ON! is a tile placement game with a theme of lead climbing. You assume the role of a climber and create climbing routes by placing wall panels on the board. Several squares are drawn in a wall panel. You roll dice and advance the number of squares, heading the top of the wall.<br/><br/>Every action consumes stamina, so you need to rest during your climb. You can try to make a challenging climb to the top without a rest, but it comes with a risk of falling down. To save you from falling down, a belayer controls a rope tied with you. You win the game if you climb up to the top of the wall first.<br/><br/>Not to be confused with the game Climb On! which is completely separate.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>\u30ea\u30fc\u30c9\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u30e2\u30c1\u30fc\u30d5\u3068\u3057\u305f\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u914d\u7f6e\u578b\u3059\u3054\u308d\u304f\u3067\u3059\u3002<br/>\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306f\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u3068\u306a\u308a\u3001\u81ea\u3089\u58c1\u9762\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3092\u914d\u7f6e\u3057\u3066\u30eb\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u3064\u304f\u308a\u3042\u3052\u3066\u3044\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\u58c1\u9762\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306b\u306f\u30de\u30b9\u76ee\u304c\u523b\u307e\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u306f2\uff5e4\u500b\u306e\u30c0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u632f\u308a\u306a\u304c\u3089\u58c1\u3092\u767b\u3063\u3066\u3044\u304f\u3053\u3068\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u3059\u3079\u3066\u306e\u884c\u52d5\u306f\u30b9\u30bf\u30df\u30ca\u3092\u6d88\u8cbb\u3057\u307e\u3059\u304b\u3089\u3001\u4f11\u61a9\u3092\u3059\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002<br/>\u6311\u6226\u7684\u306a\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u4e00\u6c17\u306b\u58c1\u3092\u99c6\u3051\u4e0a\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u305d\u308c\u306b\u306f\u589c\u843d\u3068\u3044\u3046\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u304c\u3064\u3044\u3066\u56de\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u305d\u306e\u88ab\u5bb3\u3092\u6700\u4f4e\u9650\u306b\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u3068\u30d3\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u9593\u306f\u30ed\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u7e4b\u304c\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u3053\u3046\u3084\u3063\u3066\u30eb\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u99c6\u3051\u4e0a\u308a\u3001\u58c1\u306e\u9802\u70b9\u306b\u4e0a\u304c\u3063\u305f\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u304c\u52dd\u5229\u8005\u3068\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/><br/>"}, "177147": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2506676.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Survive: Escape from Atlantis!"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Julian Courtland-Smith", "Brian Engelstein", "Geoff Engelstein", "Sydney Engelstein"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["William Bricker"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Stronghold Games"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2506676_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Science Fiction", "Space Exploration"], "description": "Welcome to the height of technology and comfort, the Space Station Atlantis!

If you encounter him, he may help you stave off the end of the world and let you peer into the future &mdash; or you may be attacked by demon horsemen and stalked by cursed followers.<br/><br/>Time is running out. When the Harbinger entered the realm he brought with him a prophecy of impending doom and a series of seven Omens to watch for: when the seventh appears, the end is upon you. Talisman (fourth edition): The Harbinger Expansion features four unique decks of Omen cards, each making manifest a different downfall. In one Omen deck the constellations align, threatening the extinction of magic. In another, the dead rise from their graves and battle to overthrow the living. In another, the time of judgement arrives bringing with it war, famine, death, plagues, and other forms of destruction.<br/><br/>In the fourth, the world shatters into many pieces and the terrain transforms unpredictably. New Terrain cards enter the game and alter the landscape, supplanting fields with barrens, deserts with floodlands, and cities with bogs. As doom draws nearer, more and more of the realm is transformed until the seventh Omen appears and all of Talisman becomes a deadly devastation.<br/><br/>In game terms, when the Harbinger is in your region, you must draw from the peril-filled Harbinger deck instead of that region's normal Adventure deck whenever you are instructed to draw cards. When you draw an Event, the Harbinger moves into your space, but has no ill effects upon you. However, you move into the space occupied by the Harbinger, you must roll a single die. The result could grant you a second turn, or let you look at the top three cards of any deck you choose. It might force you to populate your space with vicious enemies, treacherous followers, and unpredictable events. Worst of all, your result might cause the current Omen to be discarded, activating the next Omen and hastening the advent of the end times.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "0", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "French first edition", "German first edition", "Italian first edition", "Polish first edition"], "average": "7.63758", "name": "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Harbinger Expansion", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": ["Talisman (Revised 4th Edition)"], "usersrated": "165", "boardgamefamily": ["Talisman"]}, "177212": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jeffrey Neil Bellinger"], "statistics": [], "name": "TRAP!", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "15", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2507892_t.jpg", "average": "4.03333", "boardgamepublisher": ["IDW Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2507892.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition (ninja)", "English first edition (zombies)"], "maxplaytime": "30", "poll": [], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "TRAP! is a fast-paced, deductive, dice-rolling, card game system for 2-4 players in which you're trying to ensnare the biggest sets of creatures over the course of five rounds.<br/><br/>Each TRAP! game is a standalone item, but they are compatible with one another and parts can be combined to create a personalized TRAP!<br/><br/>"}, "177213": {"rpgdesigner": ["Mark A.

Their foes come from the nine kingdoms of man across three separate continents- each with their own motivations and machinations. Ashara is a world of incredibly high mountain ranges that divide the continents, meaning that wars must be fought either from the air or by sea.<br/><br/>Ashara, being the known lands of the kingdoms of mankind is at war.  The year is 1448, being the 120th occurrence of the year of the Falcon in the Zodiac of Shen. Nations battle for conquest, glory, and power. Dragon riders, highly trained warriors and the pride of their nations, sit atop powerful dragons to do battle with one another and defend against threats from the skies, lands and seas of Ashara. Dragons fight with tooth, claws and their mighty breath weapons of fire, ice, lightning, poison, acid, wind or the mysterious life stealing power of the rend. Choose your dragon and the nation you defend as you take to the skies from the back of a young and agile drake or an ancient and powerful wyrm. Or, choose to register as one of the many mercenary wings, small bands of dragon riders fighting for the highest bidder or for your own personal crusade.

Think you have a plan?  Think again!  Strategic thinking will be challenged around every bend.<br/><br/>What is Alien Run? Alien Run is a fast-paced strategic board game full of bizarre twist and turns. You can either play independent or with allies. During the race each player can be detoured by an opponent. The play of a Trump Card, Mystery Card, or landing on a Wormhole can send you into a galactic U-Turn. The secret to success is strategy. The player with the most orbs wins the game. It may sound easy, but it's not. Your strategic thinking will be challenged around every bend.<br/><br/>Each Player begins the game without Orbs, Trump Cards or Mystery Cards. That's right, empty handed. Players can collect Orbs from either game spaces, other players, Trump Cards, or Mystery Cards.  Players have the opportunity to purchase Trump Cards from the bank to add to their arsenal, however there are purchasing rules.  The Trump Cards are used for offensive and defensive plays during the game play. The secret to success is strategy, so keep your cards hidden and try to make some allies.  Remember, it's not about who finishes first but who finishes with the most Orbs.  The enticing bonus structure maybe just what a player needs to finish in the lead and be declared the winner. So get the popcorn ready, four players can finish in forty-five minutes. Game night will never be the same.<br/><br/>I almost forgot....<br/><br/>Don't get distracted by the hidden images in the game board. What a player misses can send them orbiting in the wrong direction.

They hand out quests, provide roleplaying, help the PCs and hinder them at the most infuriating moments.<br/><br/>But how can you come up with fresh new NPCs all the time?<br/><br/>It's hard making them interesting so your players don't call you out on boring gameplay.<br/><br/>And it's tough coming up with inspiration to populate your villages, cities and dungeons with great NPCs. Those places need dozens of non-player characters from shop-keepers to guards to flunkies.<br/><br/>Plus, it always takes time. I don't know about you, but I love NPCs and I just never have enough time to make all the ones I need because I have adventures to work on, maps to make, items to create....<br/><br/>And here's the worst part. When I do spend the time and energy to create a full NPC, the players just haul up and kill him! Or even worse, they ignore him completely. Why is getting ignored worse than getting killed? Hey, at least I got to play the dead NPC for a round. :)<br/><br/>Regardless, I learned a long time ago not to waste time detailing NPCs until they've proven worthy by surviving contact with the players.<br/><br/>Roleplaying Tips Presents....<br/><br/>So today I present you the perfect solution: 3 Line NPCs.<br/><br/>These suckers are not only fast to build &ndash; testers reported making a complete 3 Line NPC in 15 seconds, some in 10! &ndash; but they give you the essential ingredients you need to pull off awesome NPC encounters.<br/><br/>Even though these NPCs are just 3 lines long, they pack a huge roleplaying and story punch because of how they're constructed. One tester wrote:<br/><br/>&quot;The template was much easier to work with than I expected. It was great and useful, and it helped me return the focus to my stories, So yeah, I really liked it.&quot;<br/><br/>You see, we get stuck on the mechanics of GMing and forget one of the most important things about GMing: the story. We spend a long time detailing NPCs who may or may not survive minutes in the game, and we get a kind of tunnel vision. We lose our way fiddling with the game bits instead of making sure our game bits all help tell epic stories.<br/><br/>3 Line NPCs ensures you stay focused on what's most important to your game.<br/><br/>This book has three sections.<br/><br/>450 NPCs Ready to Go<br/><br/>One section gives you 450 instant 3 Line NPCs you can drop into your game right now. Use these for inspiration when creating your own NPCs, or just drop them into the game next time you need someone interesting for the &quot;suspicious looking guy&quot; you just made up on the spot.<br/><br/>Tutorials on How to Roll Your Own<br/><br/>Another section shows you step by step how to create your own 3 Line NPCs. It reveals the secret sauce that goes into each line that makes this method so simple yet so powerful for GMing great NPCs.<br/><br/>Several dozen Roleplaying Tips Readers tested out the formula and wrote back with tips and suggestions. I've added these into the book as well, to help you get even more mileage out of this flexible formula.<br/><br/>Killer NPC Generation Tables<br/><br/>Some readers let me know that thinking up secrets, motives, professions and other aspects of the NPCs was tough. They said once they had the seed generated, the rest flowed easily.<br/><br/>So I've added 7 killer charts to help inspire your NPC generation:<br/><br/>    d100 NPC Secrets<br/>    d135 NPC Side Plots<br/>    d50 NPC Goals, Motives &amp; Dreams<br/>    d1,000 NPC Traits<br/>    d40 Slightly More Verbose Traits<br/>    d50 NPC Fears<br/>    d65 Occupations<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>These will give you instant help when stuck making any kind of NPC.<br/><br/>Playtested &amp; Proven Awesome<br/><br/>In the making of this book, 109 game masters tested out the 3 Line NPC method. All of them said they loved the formula and found it easy to use. This technique has now been thoroughly tested. And it's been proven to work for everyone who tried it. This method will definitely work for you.<br/><br/>Any Game, And Genre<br/><br/>The 450 NPCs in this book are fantasy. The 3 Line NPC method itself, however, is universal. Use it for any game system and any genre.<br/><br/>If you need 450 instant NPCs to drop into a sci-fi game, then this book isn't for you. You'd need to switch out the fantasy elements for sci-fi, such as &quot;stormtrooper&quot; to replace &quot;guard&quot;. So, not so instant. But the inspiration tables and the tutorials are still valid, system neutral, and 100% cross-genre compatible. Because love, hate, jealousy, murder and surprises are universal.<br/><br/>"}, "177390": {"rpgartist": ["Alberto Bontempi", "Kevin Childress"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Accursed Game Master Screen Inserts", "rpgdesigner": ["John Dunn"], "rpgproducer": ["John Dunn"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2512924.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Accursed"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Horror (Supernatural)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Melior Via, LLC"], "rpg": ["Savage Worlds"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2512924_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>This 4-panel Gamemaster screen (front and back) incorporates game rules and artwork from the Accursed RPG setting for Savage Worlds.

Near systems must be explored before attempting to reach far systems.  Some far systems require key technology to be reached with any chance of success. Near systems provide resources that can build your military strength and develop technologies allowing you to overcome challenges as you go deeper into space.<br/><br/>During a turn players reveal a system card (starting with near systems) on their mission path and try to overcome its obstacles.  Next they collect wealth and resources and build military strength and technology.  And finally a random event card is drawn that may affect one or all players in the game.  The event cards are also the timer on the game.  When the event cards run out the game is over.  The Galaxy Command (all players) saves or fails in its mission by reaching enough far systems to sustain its empire.  Each Galaxy Commander (individual player), provided the empire is saved, can be the best among peers by his contribution (score) to the overall mission success.<br/><br/>No two games will play the same as the systems you get, and the decisions you make will change game to game.The event cards affect different players during each game.The game plays in 15 to 45 minutes depending on the number of players and how quick they play.The game is playable for ages 8 to 800 (if you're from planet Cirius...).<br/><br/>Originally published by Robert as a print and play solitaire game with 19 cards. In this version we have taken the original game, added a multi-player element by expanding the deck to 54 cards, new artwork, planets, and challenges but keeping the clean mechanics in place. The game was well received as it was and now we have made it playable from 1 to 4 players yet still keeping it playable in under 45 minutes.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "5.6814", "name": "Galaxy Command", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "43", "boardgamefamily": ["4X games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Solitaire Games"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BGA Ep 70 - Gamer FAQs: New Essential Games for a Collection"]}, "177412": {"rpgdesigner": ["Daniel Briscoe"], "rpg": ["Legend of the Five Rings (4th Edition)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Unexpected Allies 2", "rpgartist": ["Chris Appel", "Steve Argyle", "Drew Baker", "Nate Barnes", "Andrew Hepworth", "Craig Maher", "Bob Stevlic", "Jarreau Wimberly"], "rpgproducer": ["Shawn Carman", "Robert Denton", "Robert Hobart"], "average": "6", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": ["PoD Softcover"], "rpgsetting": ["Rokugan"], "rpggenre": ["Culture (Asian / Far Eastern)", "Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG)"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The original Unexpected Allies was one of the most popular supplements for L5R 1st Edition, offering an array of diverse and fascinating NPCs for GMs to populate their campaigns.<br/><br/>Unexpected Allies 2 offers the same for the latest 4th Edition of the Legend of the Five Rings RPG, with a huge list of NPCs from every Great Clan in Rokugan, and even a few ronin and nonhumans!<br/><br/>Many of the characters showcased here were submitted by our player-base, choosing their favorite &quot;under-represented&quot; personalities from the last ten years of L5R's storyline.<br/><br/>"}, "177413": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Motoyuki Fushimi"], "poll": [], "name": "Meiji Ishin", "playingtime": "150", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "1990", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2513505_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Sho-Kikaku"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2513505.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "150", "boardgamecategory": ["Medieval", "Wargame"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "A late game in SS series.<br/><br/>Covering the Meiji Ishin in whole Japan.<br/><br/>The map covers from Satsuma to Ezo by areas.<br/>The game is composed of recruitment, move, combat, control then redeployment.<br/>The game starts just after the battle of Toba-Fushimi.
