Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn and finally winter.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with their own village board, a mini keyp board, 12 village tiles, a keyper (waving meeple) in their player color, and a team of eight multi-colored keyples, including two white keyples. Each differently colored keyple is a specialist in one activity: the brown keyper is a woodsman, the black keyple is a miner, the orange keyple a clay worker, etc. The white keyples are generalists who can represent any other color.<br/><br/>Keyper is a worker placement game. (Keyper is the eighth new title in the medieval Key series of games, with Keydom, the second in the series being widely recognized as the first of the worker placement genre of games.) What makes Keyper special is that when one player places a keyple on a country board, another player can join them with a matching colored keyple on the first player's turn to the benefit of both players. In this way some players are likely to have played all their keyples before others. All keyples have the potential to work twice. If a player has played all of their keyples, but another player still has some, then on their turn the player with no remaining keyples can lay down one or more keyples on the country board they have claimed or in their village board to secure additional resources or actions. It can therefore be doubly beneficial to co-operate with your fellow players, although Keyper is not a co-operative game in the usual sense of the term.<br/><br/>The country boards are also noteworthy in that they can be manipulated and folded at the beginning of summer, autumn and winter to show one of four different permutations of fields for that season. A player will chose the one to suit their strategy, often hoping that another player will complement their choice. Certain fields on the country boards are available only in certain seasons, e.g., raw materials can be upgraded to finished goods only in spring and summer after which you can only convert using tiles in your own village. Gem mining occurs only in autumn and winter.<br/><br/>A player's strategy is likely to be influenced by which (seeded) spring country tiles they acquire and by the particular colored keyples they have available in the later seasons. Different combinations will encourage a player to develop their farm or village, help with their shipping or mining activities, and prepare for the seasonal fairs. Players constantly need to evaluate whether or not to join other players, when to claim a country board, whether to play on their own or another player's country board, when to use their own village, and whether to create a large or small team of keyples for the following season.

An Exit Card is randomly drawn and placed faced down in the middle of the table. This card is now the Escape Card.<br/><br/>All remaining Character Cards and Exit Cards are placed in two separate piles near the center of the table. All Tool Tokens are also placed individually at the center of the table.<br/><br/>Everyone closes their eyes. While one person counts loudly back from ten, the player holding the Enigma Character Card opens his eyes, looks at the Escape Card, and places it back to it's original position.<br/><br/>In every game of Escape from Enigma, players take turns doing one of the following actions:<br/><br/>- Take an Exit Card<br/>- Take a Tool Token<br/>- Do Character Card's ability<br/>- Bluff and do another Character Card's ability<br/>- Change your Character Card (except if you are Enigma)<br/>- Attempt to escape (except if you are Enigma)<br/>- Pass<br/><br/>To Escape, a player must call out a Tool Token he owns and peek at the Escape Card. If they match, the player wins the game. Otherwise, that player is eliminated.<br/><br/>When a player is eliminated, all his Exit Cards and Tool Tokens are returned to the center of the table, and the game resumes.<br/><br/>A second way to get eliminated for the game is through bluffing. When a player bluffs and is challenged, the defender and the challenger must show each other their Character Cards.

In the beautiful box is a playing board, 120 cards, and a single die.<br/><br/>The game is based on the idea that we all have positive and negative states of mind, and positive and negative emotional states. The playing board has 3 columns with mind states on the left, and 3 columns of emotional states on the right. The positive states are on the top, and the negative states are on the bottom.<br/><br/>There are 2 piles of cards - 60 mind cards with blue backs, and 60 emotion cards with maroon backs. On the top of each card is one of the 12 mind &amp; emotion states. In the middle of the card is a word that is an example of that mind or emotion state.<br/><br/>Each player takes a turn picking a card, and uses the word on that card to add to a developing story that&rsquo;s interesting and fun.<br/><br/>For example, let&rsquo;s say the first player picks the word SHY and begins the story: &quot;Ever since Barry was a little boy, he was always SHY and had trouble socializing in groups.&quot; <br/>The next player picks the word: INVESTIGATE, and continues the story: &quot;One day Barry was reading the newspaper about a neighborhood near where he lived. The article described houses that sounded like an excellent investment, and he decided to INVESTIGATE.&quot; <br/>The next player picks the word NEGLECTFUL, and says: &quot;When Barry arrived at the neighborhood, he saw that it was run down, looking as if the owners were NEGLECTFUL of the most basic repairs.&quot; <br/>While telling the story, the players move their pieces on the board trying to get each of their pieces into a top or bottom end zone. We&rsquo;ll now describe the rules of the game.<br/><br/>2 to 6 players can play. Each player gets two pieces that are placed on the start section in the middle of the board, one on the left mind side, and the other on the right emotion side of the board. Each player moves one piece up and down the mind side, and the other piece up and down the emotion side. The goal is to get each piece in either the top or bottom end zones.<br/><br/>On your turn:<br/><br/>Roll the die to see how many spaces to move either piece. <br/>Then pick a card from either the mind or emotion pile, and say out loud the category and word you picked. <br/>If you picked a mind card, move your mind piece. If you picked an emotion card, move your emotion piece. If the word you picked is positive, move your piece up. If the word you picked is negative, move your piece down. <br/>If the die is 2, 4, or 5, move your piece that many spaces. If the die is 3 or 6, move your piece 3 spaces up OR down. If the die is 1, roll again right away, and on this move you can move up OR down.<br/>So there are two goals of the game. The first goal is to tell an interesting and fun story together. The second goal is to be the first to get both of your pieces to an end zone. The end zones do not have to be reached by an exact number of moves.<br/><br/>Positive-mind cards: <br/>Analyzing, Interested, Aware <br/>Negative-mind cards: <br/>Oblivious, Uninterested, Unaware <br/>Positive-emotion cards: <br/>Up, Outward, Warm <br/>Negative-emotion cards: <br/>Down, Inward, Cold<br/><br/>You and your friends will enjoy many hours together playing the game of Mind and Emotions!!<br/><br/>"}, "212629": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3251611.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Kenichi Tanabe"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Kawasaki Mina"], "boardgamepublisher": ["COLON ARC"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3251611_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Deduction", "Murder/Mystery"], "description": "&quot;The stolen items will be taken by me... no, us!&quot;<br/>The knights would like to take the honor, ... no, they want just a public interesting.

Place 1 marker on the <br/>1 Shelving Unit Track space and 1 marker on the $3 space on the <br/>$ Track. 4 of the remaining markers will be used to mark Add-ons purchased.

The first player will be the one who has most recently been to their favorite local gameshop.<br/><br/>Play: Each player&rsquo;s turn consists of three phases:<br/><br/>Phase 1 Upkeep: Pay the listed upkeep fee on each of your Shelving Units. For each Shelving Unit a player cannot pay the fee for they must move a marker back 2 spaces on a Collection Track of their choice. Players do not pay the Upkeep fee on their first turn.<br/><br/>Phase 2 Dice: The player rolls the 2 dice and they may then reroll any die or dice an additional two times.<br/><br/>Dice are then used as follows: <br/>(Note: dice faces 1 (red) and 2 (yellow) do not count as Collection Track colors)<br/><br/>A. Move a marker, adding games to a colored Collection Track matching one die color rolled (3 (orange) 4 (green) 5 (blue) 6 (purple)).

Move a marker one space on a Collection Track matching one die color (3 4 5 6), and add the other die&rsquo;s value to your $ Track.<br/><br/>C. Add both die values to your $ Track. Your opponent then moves a marker on any one of your Collection Tracks back 1 space.<br/><br/>For each Shelving Unit a player owns, they may move past the        space (this space shows the first VP scoring amount on each track) on one Collection Track. They may not move past this space on an additional Collection Track until they own an additional Shelving Unit.<br/><br/>Phase 3 Expand: The current player may now purchase 1 Add-on and/or 1 Shelving Unit if they have the money to do so. Pay the listed cost and move the marker down that amount on the $ Track. Place a marker in the space next to the purchased Add-on. The first player to purchase a listed Add-on receives a $1 discount off the purchase price. The dice are then passed to the other player.<br/><br/>Add-ons: 1 Add-on may be purchased by a player each turn. <br/>The first player to purchase a listed add-on receives a $1 discount off the purchase price. Score VP at game end.<br/><br/>Game End: The game ends when 1 player purchases all 4 Add-ons or<br/>when a player reaches the maximum VP space on one Collection Track. The player&rsquo;s opponent may then take 1 final turn.<br/><br/>Score each Collection Track you own a Shelving Unit for.

(Birdie Fight) is card game about birds trying to achieve dominance in the forest. Each bird is a different colour in the game.<br/><br/>Players are forest spirits, trying to secretly guide their chosen bird to success. The cards are numbered 1 to 7 in red, blue, green and white. The players lay a card from their hand to a 5x5 grid after nut tokens (points) are laid out for each row and column.<br/><br/>When the grid is full of cards, the rows and columns are checked. The colour with the highest total in a line takes the nut token for that bird. Colours with tied totals are ignored, so a low value card can win the nut token for that bird.<br/><br/>When the nuts are totalled up for the birds, the players reveal their final hand card. That card is the bird they favoured (so more than one player might be helping the same bird), and for each player, the number on the card is added to the nut total to identify who has the dominant bird.<br/><br/>Since the players choose which bird they favour by leaving it as their final hand card, they can delay this choice until they see how the game is panning out.<br/><br/>The game rules come in Japanese and English, the game itself being language free.

First players have four statements/questions on each card to choose from. Second rather than be provided a hand of cards with a predefined responses, No Blank Left Behind instead utilizes whiteboards and dry erase markers allowing players to come up with their own responses, limited only by their individual imaginations. And lastly who wrote what answer is not kept a secrete from the judge or as it is know in No Blank Left Behind &ldquo;The Dictator&rdquo;.

You are never stuck with answer cards that don't fit the question. In-jokes or even the players themselves can become answers and the same answers can be used over and over leading to some very funny running jokes.

Federation Known Space is a territory shaped a lot like an egg. The most advanced part of Known Space, the Core Worlds, are the yoke, while the expanse beyond that yoke is an untamed wilderness called The Fringe. And beyond the Fringe lies the Unknown.<br/><br/>The Fringe is largely a lawless place, despite being nominally under Federation control. While influence from the Federation planets does exist, that influence is spread too thin and to wide. At the same time, the many worlds of the Fringe hold the promise of freedom and vast stores of unspoiled resources ready for the taking. In such a place, the lawless thrive. Vast fortunes are made...by the pirate and mercenary bands that prey on the weak and helpless. Not to mention the corporate conglomerates, who exploit their workers in any number of ways, far from the watchful eye of the Federation enforcement agencies.<br/><br/>In this dangerous realm, small colonies largely depend upon the meager resources their corporate sponsors choose to send them, or in some cases must hire their own militias and protection at an expense that they can ill-afford. Concepts such as &ldquo;Law and Order&rdquo; are thus thought as something that is bought and sold, going to the highest bidder.<br/><br/>In such a realm, there is little respect and less money dedicated to active police. And most of what few such organizations there are thought of as ineffectual at best, corrupt or incompetent at worst. They are also underpaid and overworked. There are, though, a dedicated few who still try to keep the peace and bring law and order to the outlaw worlds of this wild region &ndash; the famed Star Marshals.<br/><br/>The Star Marshals are an elite law enforcement outfit under the nominal control of the Federation. The core stated goal of the Star Marshals is to keep the Fringe safe from the various criminal elements that infest it.<br/><br/>However, their true goal is to keep the chaos and crime of the outer regions from spilling back into the Core Worlds. Their job is immense and never-ending, policing a huge amount of space with scant resources and even scanter aid from both the Core Worlds and the Fringe (who tend to resent outside influence on their territory, except during the immediate aftermath of a terrible crime that they are ill-equipped to handle).<br/><br/>Thus each day the fearless men and woman of the Star Marshals must battle a tide of never-ending lawlessness and hostilities. Space pirates are, of course, the most plentiful foe that the Star Marshals must face, and frequently (but not always) the crimes that they commit are the most horrific. However, in fact the tasks deeded to the Star Marshals run the gamut from dealing with criminal and/or exploitative corporate actions, rebellious military generals, and alien incursions into Fringe space. Those that succeed at these daunting tasks become legend. Those that fail are simply dead.<br/><br/>In the end, the task of the Star Marshals in endless and thankless, but those few that hear the call, answer it and conduct themselves with pride and honor.<br/><br/>In the vastness of space, few will ever see justice, unless you bring it to them.<br/><br/>"}, "212825": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "New Corruption Manifestations Volume II", "rpgdesigner": ["Alex Riggs", "Joshua Zaback"], "rpgproducer": ["Rosa Gibbons"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3247937.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Horror (Supernatural)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Necromancers of the Northwest"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Weekly Wonders"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3247937_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Be Your Own Kind of Monster!<br/><br/>Corruptions, from Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Horror Adventures, give players a new way to indulge their dark fantasies and take the role of gothic monsters, infecting themselves with some taint or darkness, and presenting the tantalizing question of whether to struggle against the corruption, or embrace it, and allow themselves to bask, however briefly, in its dark power.

Each player in her turn gets one guess and says what's the value (from 1 to 5) of chosen opponent's Suspect card. If the guess is right the Suspect is removed and the player who guessed correctly receives a point card. If the guess is wrong the card stays face-up and nothing happens.

It is a Schr&ouml;dinger's cat of sorts. It is everyone&rsquo;s cat and nobody&rsquo;s cat at the same time. It may or may not have been shit in. All of this and more will be worked out by the end of this ridiculous game.<br/><br/>Say hello to Albert Kittensworth. You can tell by the expression on his face that he is not looking forward to playing this game. But you should be. Albert may not be very good a catching mice or playing with string, but there is one skill that makes him as unique as he is precious - his ability to hold an almost limitless number of objects in his ample rear compartment. You can put anything and everything in there, and by the end of the game, you will. Well, everything but one thing, that is. There is one thing that simply will not be tolerated, so let's make this perfectly clear, DO NOT SHIT IN MY CAT.<br/><br/>Players start the game with a hand of cards that will contain some very unusual objects as well as a freshly-baked loaf that most definitely did not come from a bakery. On their turn, Albert will spin around to face them with his best side forward and they will draw a card and add it to their hand. They will then randomly select one of their face down cards, look at it and announce to the table what they are placing inside of the cat. If the card the player selected was their poo card, they should lie and claim it is a different item. After all, you wouldn't want the other players to know you just shit in the cat. It will be our little secret. Keep in mind there a few additional poo cards that you can pick up out of the draw pile and you might even start the game with more then one poo card. During each round players will draw cards, place cards and sometimes even discard each other's cards.<br/> Eventually someone will become suspicious of a fellow player and will point across the table and demand an answer to that age old question &ldquo;Did you shit in my cat?&rdquo; Once accused, the player will need to show if they still have a poo in their hand of cards. Because they cannot view their hand of cards during play, they may not know if their poo has been removed and placed inside the cat. One by one they begin to reveal their cards. If they do not have a poo card, then they indeed were the offending party member that committed this heinous act. And even though only one person was actually caught brown-handed, they were probably not the only one to leave a poo in you know who.

For if too much spirit energy pools, it forms a Well, a passageway to the Old Worlds, where monsters and god-like beings still dwell, ready to make Midgard their own again, and enslave humankind once more.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>In Summoner&rsquo;s Isle you are an unproven adept, competing in a rite of passage to prove that you have full command over your creatures. To do so you must apply careful strategy, prove yourself in combat and most importantly, demonstrate your ability to absorb large quantities of spirit energy. Only once you have achieved all three will you graduate to the mainland to take your place among the exalted ranks of the Summoners.<br/><br/>"}, "212970": {"poll": [], "name": "Comboids", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3284654_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3284654.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Spanish first edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Fighting"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Comboids is a card game where you can build your own team of combat androids and use them to fight against your opponent.<br/>Your objective is simple, destroy them all!<br/><br/>You start by building yout team of combat androids.

The goal of the game is to destroy your opponent's&rsquo; defenses, and be the last faction standing!<br/><br/>Combo: This is the core mechanic of the game. To Combo, the Active Player must combine (sum the numbers on the cards) at least 2 cards and total it up to a final card. For example if i have a Blue 4, Red 5 and a Green 9 in my Play-Area; i can combine the first two cards and total it up to the 9, which is equal to the green card, dealing the total as damage to my opponent&rsquo;s defense. Note that making a Combo is independent of the colors on the cards you are using. 1 can be counted as both &ldquo;1 and 11&rdquo; in value, and the special cards all have a value of 10 in the case of making Combos, and each has different abilities when you finish your Combos with them.<br/><br/>When a player performs a Combo, he puts the final card of the Combo on top of an opponent&rsquo;s face down defense card. Think of the final card of the Combo, the troop that you are sending to an opposing faction&rsquo;s defense. Each defense can be destroyed by a minimum of 21 damage. When a defense card has cards on it with a total of 21 or more, that defense gets destroyed, in which case the player whose defense got destroyed reveals the defense card and adds it to his/her Play-Area to use it on his/her next turn.<br/><br/>The game comes with 112 cards consisting of:<br/>        2 sets of cards that starts from 1 and goes to 10 of each color, with different weights.
