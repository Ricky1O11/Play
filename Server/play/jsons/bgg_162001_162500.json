This rivalry, egged on in Germany by Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, then helped ignite the First World War.<br/><br/>As usual, reality is a little more complicated than popular history. Tirpitz&rsquo;s enemy lay not across the North Sea but rather in the War Ministry offices just on the other side of the Brandenburger Tor. Army and Navy battled furiously for funding, inventing, respectively, the (possibly mythical) Schlieffen Plan and the Risk Theory (less mythical, but just as detached from reality) to justify ever-higher levels of spending. In the event, neither got what they wanted: the Navy did not build a new class of dreadnoughts every fiscal year, nor did the Army get to muster two dozen new divisions to &ldquo;reinforce the right.&rdquo;<br/><br/>But what if Tirpitz had won his real battle? Germany had the financial and industrial resources to build a fleet to challenge the British. What might this fleet have looked like, and how would it have stood up to the Grand Fleet in battle?<br/><br/>High Seas Fleet is a supplement for the Great War at Sea series that studies this question with background essays, over two dozen new scenarios, and 70 new scorchless, sootless laser-cut playing pieces. It is not playable by itself; you&rsquo;ll need our Jutland game (and only our Jutland game) to play the scenarios. You can, of course, just read the essays and fondle the pieces without owning Jutland. We won&rsquo;t tell.<br/><br/>New pieces include German battleships designed but never built: the 1904 semi-dreadnought, the 1905 dreadnought, the 1912 dreadnought with 13.8-inch main guns, and the repeat Baden class super-dreadnoughts. There are additional cruisers and battleships to fill out the classes of the German program, and the full Bl&uuml;cher class of six armored cruisers.<br/><br/>This is a powerful fleet that can stand toe-to-toe with the British Grand Fleet &ndash; the fleet the propagandists boasted of but Tirpitz feared to actually build.

One of those unfortunate countries, Poland, had been cynically divided between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany via the Molotov&ndash;Ribbentrop Pact, as the opener for World War II. Despite the valor and sacrifice of over 200,000 Poles fighting for the Allies, their interests were betrayed at the Yalta and Potsdam conference, and as a consequence, the Soviet Union ruled Poland through a puppet Socialist government for the next 45 years.<br/><br/>Unlike most other Panzer Grenadier titles, Red &amp; White explores one of the &quot;what ifs&quot; of history; in this case, what if the Poles had been able to return home and set up their own government in the postwar era?

Formed in October 1939 from three regiments of long-service professionals, the 1st Moroccan Infantry Division immediately became one of the French Army&rsquo;s elite units.<br/><br/>All ten Moroccan infantry regiments deployed to metropolitan France in the fall of 1939. The 1st, 2nd and 7th regiments went to the 1st Moroccan Infantry Division; the other seven were scattered among seven different divisions (four to North African infantry divisions, and three to metropolitan French divisions).<br/><br/>While the French Army could (and did) induct conscripts in its other African colonies, by law it could not do so in Morocco. A French protectorate, Morocco still had a Sultan and court, though they possessed no power, and therefore only volunteers could be recruited in Morocco. Most recruits came from a rural peasant background, and appear to have seen the Moroccan regiments as a continuation of the Sultan&rsquo;s army and therefore not an alien institution. While Moroccan troops were denied &ldquo;Saint Pinard,&rdquo; the daily ration of three-quarters of a liter of red wine, French cadre appear to have happily shared theirs within the barracks, and alcoholism appears to have driven some Moroccan enlistments.<br/><br/>Soldiers who completed their four-year term were exempt from the prestation, the French tax of 12 days of labor per year (or its cash equivalent) on public works projects. Many signed up for additional tours. Senior officers, and many junior and non-commissioned officers, were French. But the Meknes Military School, established in 1918, had turned out a large number of native Moroccan commissioned officers who usually filled half of the slots at the company level and below. All these factors combined for strong unit cohesion and solid morale, and in February 1940 the division received a new commander in Albert Raymond Mellier, the former director of indigenous affairs in the Morocco Protectorate. Well-known to officers and men, and speaking fluent Arabic, Mellier led his division from the front, using a motorcycle to keep himself constantly at the crucial point.<br/><br/>When the Germans struck in May, 1st Moroccan Division formed part of IV Corps in 1st Army, sent into Belgium to meet the advance. Heavily engaged in the Battle of Gembloux, the Moroccans fought the German XVI Panzer Corps to a standstill in three days of bloody fighting. The Germans never penetrated the Moroccan line despite mass tank assaults and heavy use of Stuka dive-bombers. With screams of Allah Akbar! a battalion of the 7th Moroccan Regiment launched a mass bayonet charge against the tanks of 4th Panzer Division, driving the panicked panzers from the battlefield at the cost of heavy casualties. In only three days of fighting the division had suffered 27 percent casualties. The Moroccans fought in the Lille Pocket at the end of May, with most of the division staff and many of its troops captured when the pocket surrendered. The remnants of the division continued to fight until France laid down her arms on June 24th.<br/><br/>Organized as a standard French infantry division, 1st Moroccan Division had three infantry regiments, each of three battalions. In peacetime the Moroccan regiments had four or five battalions; upon French mobilization the extra battalions were detached for duty in Syria or other colonies. The division had a light artillery regiment, made up of mixed French and Moroccan personnel, and a heavy artillery regiment, almost exclusively manned by Frenchmen.<br/><br/>We chose this elite division for our new Division Marocain special set of Panzer Grenadier pieces, available exclusively for members of the Gold Club. There are 176 pieces made to our new standard, using scorchless laser-cutting technology (really, there are no scorch marks: the ink layer is laid down after the pieces are cut).

As a highly favored unit, it received such treatment far more often than the usual German Army formation. But with a massive new offensive in the offing, this time the re-fitting had a very definite purpose.<br/><br/>Though now titled &ldquo;Panzer Grenadier Division Grossdeutschland,&rdquo; the re-organized division would be much stronger than a standard panzer grenadier division or even panzer division. Like a panzer grenadier division, it had two regiments each of three battalions. In early June 1943, about a month before the Battle of Kursk opened, the division received enough half-track armored personnel carriers to mount the first battalion of each of its motorized infantry regiments &ndash; a practice usually confined to well-equipped panzer divisions.<br/><br/>That doesn&rsquo;t tell the whole story: each battalion, at least on paper, had considerably more firepower than the panzer grenadier battalions of regular panzer and panzer grenadier divisions. Each had the typical three rifle companies and one machine gun company, but had three machine gun platoons rather than two, and a fifth &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; company with an additional engineer platoon and infantry gun platoon. In the normal line unit, the mortar and machine gun elements had been broken up and assigned to the rifle companies. A Grossdeutschland rifle company copied this organization and thus had its own machine gun and mortar support &ndash; the battalion-level assets were in addition to these, giving the Grossdeutschland battalion twice as many machine guns and mortars.<br/><br/>And that was just the start. A panzer grenadier division usually had either a tank battalion or one of assault guns. Grossdeutschland had one of each, and in the spring of 1943 received a second tank battalion. As if that were not enough, an oversized company of Tiger tanks joined the division as well, expanding to become the tank regiment&rsquo;s third battalion in the August 1943. A regular panzer division had but two tank battalions, and no assault guns (unless they took the place of tanks).<br/><br/>And there was still more extra firepower. They typical German panzer division&rsquo;s artillery regiment had three battalions, two of them of towed guns and one self-propelled. Grossdeutschland had a fourth artillery battalion. The regular army panzer division had an anti-aircraft battalion with three batteries (two of 88mm guns, one of light guns); Grossdeutschland&rsquo;s battalion had six batteries (three each, heavy and light).<br/><br/>All told, Grossdeutschland&rsquo;s combat strength probably equaled that of a regular Army panzer division plus a regular Army panzer grenadier division. That sort of weaponry certainly helped Grossdeutschland gain a reputation as an elite unit; Grossdeutschland&rsquo;s morale and tactical leadership appear to have been very good, but there&rsquo;s no substitute for firepower.<br/><br/>At Kursk, Grossdeutschland was deployed with 48th Panzer Corps as part of the southern German flank. It suffered heavy casualties in the initial assault, particularly in its Fusilier regiment which became entangled in thick Soviet minefields. The tank regiment, deploying its Tigers at the tip of a giant armored wedge, managed to make some progress but despite all that firepower Grossdeutschland did not do as well as the neighboring 3rd Panzer Division. The division was not involved in the massive tank battle at Prokhorovka.<br/><br/>Grossdeutschland figures in many of the scenarios from our Kursk: Burning Tigers game. Our Grossdeutschland 1943 special counter set, available exclusively to members of the Gold Club, lets you play those scenarios with units in the division&rsquo;s own livery. It has 176 fantastic laser-cut pieces, using new scorchless and sootless technology: the laser cuts the pieces first, and then the sheet is printed.

Age +6 years<br/><br/>DESCRIPTION<br/>At first sight, memm appears to be a simple game as it is composed by only 36 geometric cubes of different colours. However, memm goes far beyond this apparent simplicity. memm is a dynamic, visually entertaining and aesthetically attractive  game, but above all, memm  is game full of possibilities and lots of game play. These characteristics makes memm the ideal cognitive development game to play with the whole family.<br/><br/>PREPARATION<br/>The 36 coloured cubes are placed on the table, mixed and shared equally amongst the participants. Then a cube with all the six colours is rolled. The player having the cube with the resulting colour on all its 6 sides will start the game by placing this cube in the centre of the table.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>Clockwise, the following players will place one cube so that joining sides match colours.  A cube can be placed on top of the starting cube. However, this move will be subject to a special rule that will be discussed in the SPECIAL RULE section.<br/><br/>ABILITY TO REPEAT TURN<br/>A player gains the ability to repeat turn if he joins a cube by two sides. Please note this is only physically possible as from the fourth turn.<br/>A player gains the ability to repeat turn and get rid of one of his cubes by handing it to a player of his choice if he joins a cube by three sides.<br/>A player gains the ability to repeat turn and get rid of two of his cubes by handing them to a player of his choice if he joins a cube by four sides.<br/><br/>If a player joins a cube by five sides, gains the ability to repeat turn and get rid of three of his cubes by handing them to a player of his choice.<br/><br/>SPECIAL RULE<br/>No more than three cubes will be placed in the same direction in a row of turns. This rule prevents the formation of continuous lines of cubes and is not to be confused with a limitation of the central structure being developed during the game. When a player places a cube on top of another, the player will have, on his next turn, the possibility of you can also put it in one of the free sides of any of the cubes that are in the same vertical.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE<br/>The first player who gets rid of all his cubes wins the game. However, unless this player is the last to play in the round, the remaining players will be placing their cubes until the full round of turns is completed. At that point, the player left with more cubes loses. In a tie in number of cubes , you will lose more different colours have. If they have the same number of colours , the result will be a tie.<br/><br/>VARIATIONS OF THE GAME<br/>This is the basic and general form of the game. Nevertheless, a number of variants were also explored to create a series of dimensional figures that would condition the placement of cubes. Some examples are detailed in the photo section. <br/>A rotating circular table can be added to the game to facilitate players with the different angles and spatial perspective of the figure being created and gain fluency and aesthetics in the game.<br/>Specification (Components, forms, materials, sizes):<br/>Components : game box , instructions , manual with different figures to make and 36 cubes with the following distribution of coloured sides :<br/>6 cubes with all sides the same colour.<br/>6 cubes with 5 sides of the same colour and with a different side.<br/>6 cubes with 4 sides of the same colour and with 2 different sides.<br/>6 cubes with 3 sides of the same colour and with 3 different sides.<br/>6 cubes with 2 sides of the same colour and with 4 different sides.<br/>6 cubes with all sides of different colour.<br/><br/>In principle, the chosen colours are red , yellow , orange , violet, blue and green.<br/><br/>Each cube will have on each side a roman number that determines the number of sides with that colour. For example, a &quot;V&quot; on the a red face of a cube means that there are 5 red sides on that cube.<br/><br/><br/><br/>1 Descripci&oacute;n de memm: Jugadores: de 2 a 4. Edad: +6 a&ntilde;os.<br/>memm aparenta ser un juego sencillo por tratarse s&oacute;lo de 36 cubos geom&eacute;tricos de diferentes colores, pero va m&aacute;s all&aacute; de esa aparente sencillez. memm es un juego con multitud de posibilidades, din&aacute;mico, muy est&eacute;tico (al quedar figuras de colores incre&iacute;bles), entretenido y, sobre todo, con much&iacute;sima jugabilidad.<br/><br/>2 Instrucciones<br/>Se colocan los 36 cubos de colores en la mesa, se remueven y se reparten equitativamente entre los jugadores participantes. Se lanza un cubo con un color diferente en cada cara y empieza el que tenga el cubo con las 6 caras del color que haya salido. Se comienza la partida situando el cubo en el centro de la mesa. El siguiente jugador (los turnos se realizan en orden del sentido de las agujas del reloj) tendr&aacute; que colocar una de las caras de los cubos que le ha tocado en una de las caras libres del &uacute;ltimo cubo puesto en la mesa. Esta uni&oacute;n de caras s&oacute;lo se podr&aacute; realizar si coinciden en su color. Los jugadores podr&aacute;n situar el cubo en la cara superior, pero esta acci&oacute;n estar&aacute; sujeta a una regla especial de la secci&oacute;n 3. Se proceder&aacute; de la misma manera en turnos siguientes con las siguientes condiciones:<br/> 3 Posibilidad de repetici&oacute;n de turno<br/><br/>Cubo toca una sola cara con &uacute;ltimo cubo puesto: no coloca ning&uacute;n cubo m&aacute;s y pasa a siguiente jugador seg&uacute;n turno.<br/><br/>Cubo en la mesa toca dos caras con &uacute;ltimo cubo puesto: posibilidad de colocar otro cubo de nuevo.<br/><br/>Cubo en la mesa toca tres caras con &uacute;ltimo cubo puesto: posibilidad de colocar otro cubo de nuevo y puede deshacerse de un cubo suyo, entreg&aacute;ndoselo al jugador que crea conveniente.<br/><br/>Cubo en la mesa toca cuatro caras con &uacute;ltimo cubo puesto: posibilidad de colocar otro cubo de nuevo y puede deshacerse de dos cubos suyos, entreg&aacute;ndoselos al jugador o jugadores que crea conveniente.<br/><br/>Cubo en la mesa toca cinco caras con &uacute;ltimo cubo puesto: posibilidad de colocar otro cubo de nuevo y puede deshacerse de tres cubos suyos, entreg&aacute;ndoselos al jugador o jugadores  que crea conveniente.<br/><br/>4 Reglas especiales<br/>No se podr&aacute; colocar m&aacute;s de tres cubos en turnos seguidos en la misma direcci&oacute;n. Esta regla evita la formaci&oacute;n de una l&iacute;nea interminable de cubos y no debe ser confundida con una limitaci&oacute;n de las dimensiones de la estructura a formar durante el juego.<br/><br/>Cuando un jugador coloca un cubo sobre otro cubo en cualquier nivel de la estructura, el mismo jugador (en caso de uni&oacute;n de 2 o m&aacute;s caras) o el siguiente jugador (en caso de uni&oacute;n de una sola cara) deber&aacute; colocar su cubo de tal manera que haga contacto con la vertical sobre la que descansa ese cubo, incluyendo &eacute;ste.<br/><br/>5 Objetivo final<br/>Un jugador ganar&aacute; la partida cuando sea el primero en deshacerse de todos sus cubos, aunque deber&aacute; esperar a que el &uacute;ltimo jugador de esa ronda haya completado su turno. Es decir, el resto de jugadores  podr&aacute;n colocar sus cubos e incluso entregar sus cubos a cualquier contrincante hasta la finalizaci&oacute;n esa ronda.. En ese momento, perder&aacute; el que se haya quedado con m&aacute;s cubos. Si hay empate en n&uacute;mero de cubos, perder&aacute; el que m&aacute;s colores diferentes posea. Si tienen el mismo n&uacute;mero de colores, habr&aacute; empate en dicho jugadores.<br/><br/>Esta es la modalidad b&aacute;sica y general del juego. Pero se pens&oacute; en las miles de posibilidades de unas piezas tan vers&aacute;tiles.

In this new action-filled and incredible realistic role-playing adventure game, your mission is to track and kill the terrorists who have captured your planet's research station.<br/><br/>However, the way to these skilled and dangerous radicals is anything but easy. You will face a myriad of challenges including jungles, swamps and traps. In oder to survive, you'll have to avoid these pitfalls and solve mind-bending puzzles. From every side, you will be attacked by a variety of predators, such as blobs, cannibals, baby Yetis, and Samurai robots. In a flash, you can go from being the hunter to being the hunted, with a bounty placed on your own head. With the terrorists taken care of, your mission isn't finished. You must still save the station and collect your reward.<br/><br/>Players can choose between two game modes: role playing or arcade. The first will appeal to those who prefer strategy, while the second caters to those who crave action. Two modes means twice the fun and double the entertainment. It's like getting two different games in a single box.<br/><br/>In role-playing mode, you will experience the real-life physical challenges (including pounding heart rate, injuries, fatigue and poisoning) of your character, created by the game's real-time simulation. Your job is to keep track of your food, energy, health and blood pressure to ensure that you don't perish before you reach your goal.<br/><br/>For the most aggressive players, DEUS's arcade mode lets you grab a weapon and mow down any and every enemy in your path. Choose anything from an axe to a rocket launcher from your personal arsenal and attack any of the 40 different enemies that are lying in wait for you. DEUS animates characters and landscapes in 3D and adds 3D stereo sound, multiple light sources, and transparency and wave effects. The result of two years of work by 15 artists, musicians and programmers, this game provides high-quality animation, real-time effects, and unbelievable realism.<br/><br/>DEUS, which is Windows 95 and DOS compatible, requires a minimum configuration of a Pentium 90 processor, SVGA monitor, 8 Mb of RAM, a quad-speed CD-ROM drive and a 16-bit sound card.

Only opponent's pieces may be jumped or captured.  Pieces cannot be crowned in opponent's home rows.  Movements are not otherwise restricted on any part of the board.

By drawing a network of roads on their play sheet, players are building a city and trying to score points for their hotels, shops and taxis &mdash; all while avoiding pollution.<br/><br/>Working out an ideal road network can be quite the puzzle, so before the game begins roads through parks are randomized, making sure that no two games will be alike. Each round, one white die per player, one additional white die, and a blue die are rolled onto the table. The blue die indicates which column the players must use, while each white die indicates a row. In turn each player picks a white die and draws in the given space. In most spaces you draw roads, but in parks you instead build houses. You can draw only once in each space, and if on your turn you cannot draw, you gain pollution.<br/><br/>A building is scored the moment you draw in its space. For example, when you draw a road through a hotel space, you score points equal to the length of the road passing through that hotel. Shops score according to how many houses are currently connected to the shop. There are also bonuses awarded to the first player who connects a shop to a certain number of houses.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player completes the highest possible hotel or shop score, or when a player loses his last tree due to pollution.

All three of us - Dmitry, Alexey, and I - were fans of Pascal and structured programming despite then-recently-published text &quot;Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal&quot;. We used various flavors of Pascal to implement our game ideas. Under MS DOS the development system of choice was Borland's Turbo Pascal. I started learning programming with v1.0. In fact, I still enjoy programming in the descendant of Turbo Pascal - Borland Delphi. The last version of Tetris, we worked on together, was compiled with Turbo Pascal 4. That last version of the game had number 3.12. Although 3.12 is pretty much an arbitrary number as we did not have a strict versioning policy. By the way, this version has an Easter Egg. Although not a sophisticated one. I wonder if anyone can discover it.<br/><br/>The MS DOS version is quite different from the Electronica 60 draft which initially had just the glass and a score count. That version worked on a monochromatic (green/black) alphanumeric display. The tetramino squares were drawn as a pair of square brackets [ ]. Remarkably, the game was playable and addictive even in that form. This gave us a reason to hurry up with the MS DOS implementation. I believe Alexey expanded his Electronica version of the game after we ported it to the PC to match some of the features we had in our PC games. I never worked with Electronica computers myself.<br/><br/>We diligently implemented the MS DOS version of the game in such a way that it could run on any PC we had available. The program  ran in a text mode using colored space symbols to represent squares of teraminos. The game could even automatically recognize the IBM monochrome card adjusting the way it drew (printed) on the screen. The clock-frequency race had already started with the introduction of IBM PC AT and PC clones. Many games released for the earlier PC and PC XT (4.77 MHz) models ran too fast on the newer machines. The last version of our game was one of the first to use proper timer delays. 20 years later the same program still runs without any changes, looks and feels the same (especially in the full screen DOS box).<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website. --Vadim Gerasimov<br/><br/>"}, "162155": {"poll": [], "name": "Thor's Hammer", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["DOS edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2092096.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Escape Programming"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure", "First Person Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS"], "average": "5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["MVP Software"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2092096_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Thor's Hammer is a first-person adventure and fighting game.

Heeding the cries of the people, the Panda Guardians opened a spirit gate allowing refugees to flee to a new land. Once there, the people and animals of Panda Land (as it was named) lived in harmony under the benevolent guardianship of the Panda Monks. But, as always happens, evil entered the area and corrupted the heart of the greatest of the Panda Monks, Jaq-Blaq. He betrayed his fellows and installed himself as a warlord.<br/><br/>Despite his might, Jaq-Blaq ruled in fear: the owls prophesized that a donkey hero would free Panda Land.  After Jaq-Blaq&rsquo;s natural (non-donkey related) death, rule passed to his son.  The son&rsquo;s love of food and dislike of exercise earned him the name Fat Panda. While Jaq-Blaq ran the land with stern efficiency, Fat Panda&rsquo;s sloth, greed and gluttony plunged the land into disarray. While the common folk made a few efforts to rebel against Fat Panda, his minions always managed to crush them. Thus did Fat Panda grow fat with confidence, despite the prophecy that donkey hoofs of justice would kick Fat Panda off his throne. Now the donkey of the prophecy journeys to Panda Land to save the people and to learn of his tragic past!<br/><br/>The Uncommon Commoners #3: The Way of the Hoof is a Pathfinder Role Playing Game compatible adventure.

But while this ball is in full swing, a masked figure, of who had not been seen before, has started to make its way throughout the rooms of the abbey. Angered by this figure&rsquo;s mask of a plague ridden corpse, the prince tried to kill the figure but was killed in the process.

Luckily, they found a hidden valley and established the appropriately named town of Hidden Valley. Being compassionate sorts, the humans invited other refugees, including a band of Halflings to join their community.

Diesel Mice is designed with the intention of taking the FirstFable framework and building a setting reminiscent of many animated films (specifically, those dealing with mice living in a world just below the notice of the human world).<br/><br/>The rest of this book explains how to customize characters and how the game system works. It also provide advice for running the game, keeping the players engaged, and making sure everyone has fun. Finally, it finishes off with Raid On The Steel Mill, an introductory adventure. To run a game of Diesel Mice, you&rsquo;ll need this book and a handful of six-sided dice (you can get these at many &ldquo;big box&rdquo; stores for very little money, or you can buy cool-looking colored dice from game stores &mdash; the love of multicolored dice starts early!)<br/><br/>For those of you familiar with FirstFable, there are a few changes from the original rules. The biggest change is that Diesel Mice does not make use of Character Books. There are character types included in this book in the Mouse Types chapter. Also, Special Things and Weaknesses have been reworked a little bit. The rules-as-written in FirstFable made you use Stars from Special Things and then optionally add a dice roll to them. Instead of that, in Diesel Mice you roll the dice, and then decide if you want to add Stars from the Special Thing. Also, Special Things provide Permission (a concept that has been discussed in the Fate community) meaning that Special Things may not mechanically influence a roll, but still give the ability to make the roll when a character without that Special Thing would not be given even a<br/>chance. Using a Weakness recharges a Star on a Special Thing. Finally, there is an appendix on Advanced FirstFable system that is designed to be used as a next step for roleplayers who find FirstFable a little too simple.<br/><br/>"}, "162190": {"rpgartist": ["Gary Dupuis"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "statistics": [], "name": "Witch Options", "rpgdesigner": ["Robert W.

This product includes a 360-degree panoramic view from the center of the shop.<br/><br/>Alchemist&rsquo;s Shop is intended for use in modern games. Boilers and a machine are displayed in the map therefore electricity is a minimum requirement. The style of the shop would fit a steampunk or teslapunk game easily.<br/><br/>Adventure hook for use with this product.<br/><br/>The Teslamuter: An alchemist became quite popular in town by selling potions he created with his Teslamuter. The potions he has created with electricity give a jolt to the people that imbibe them and make them full of energy. But when the potion runs out, the imbiber becomes lethargic until he can get another dose. This made people into addicts of the alchemist&rsquo;s potions.<br/><br/>Then people started dropping dead of heart attacks. Worse a rash of grave robbing incidents followed targeting the victims.<br/><br/>The Player Characters can get involved in several ways. One way is that one of the characters or their allies becomes addicted to the potions. They should have a highly positive effect such as increased speed, better initiative, more actions, etc. but the negative effect should be something like fatigue, or debilitating penalties reverse of the positive effect once the potion runs out. When the imbiber has a heart attack and either dies or is left holding on for dear life, the group goes to the alchemist for either revenge or a cure to the addiction.<br/><br/>Or the player characters can get involved by being investigators into the mysterious glut of heart attack deaths and graveyard robbery perhaps even catching the alchemist in the act of robbing a grave. In this scenario, the alchemist is a bit better prepared and has a surprise for the them; zombies with a replacement heart that pumps his Teslamuter solution to keep the body going. Those who were addicted in life have a greater affinity for the substance in death forcing him to target their bodies specifically rather than just any old corpse.<br/><br/>"}, "162258": {"rpgdesigner": ["Steven J.

It also might work in near future science fiction settings such as cyberpunk although the old-style monitors are a bit of a stretch. The really cheap company simply refuses to invest in new monitors in that case, forcing their employees to work with outdated equipment.

The employee knows he saw the boss doing things on his personal computer (PC) that are not in the company&rsquo;s interests. He needs a copy of all the information on the PC. He intends to use the information to blackmail his boss to either get his job back or barring that to humiliate him and get him fired. And perhaps both.<br/><br/>He hires the Player Characters to break into the office at night and use an external hard drive to download all the information on his boss&rsquo;s PC. The Player Characters must bypass the locked front door and the lone security guard on watch. The boss&rsquo;s PC is protected by passwords and other firewalls requiring the Player Characters to hack into the PC to get all the information out of it. While the information is being downloaded into the external hard drive, a squad of security guards suddenly arrives from the stairs and elevator and tells the group to freeze. Was there an alarm built into the PC itself? These security guards are wearing a completely different uniform than the security guard that was on watch. If they want to get the information out of there, they&rsquo;ll have to fight off the security guards while the download completes!<br/><br/>"}, "162259": {"rpgdesigner": ["Steven J.

Not only did they find rich veins of ore, but also strange and bizarre alien artifacts. Rather than register them with the government of the solar system, they decided to make molds of the alien artifacts, hollow out the cores of some of their mineral cubes, and replace them with the alien artifacts in molds. They sent these specific cores to their corporate headquarters for study of the alien artifacts at their research labs. The expansion of the mining colony added colonists who work to make the colony self-sufficient.<br/><br/>Pirates often attack the transport shuttle but the fighters have fended them off up to now. This time, a single alien fighter attacked the transport shuttle and managed to disable one of the fighters before a lucky shot by his wingman destroyed the alien ship. The mining company sent home for help from their corporate headquarters immediately.<br/><br/>The Player Characters are mercenaries bringing a new fighter with them to the mining colony. As soon as they land in the hangar, people inside the facility panic. Some sort of alien carrier has appeared. The fighter on the landing strip is bombed and most of the personnel panic and flee to the subterranean level via the elevator. The alien carrier lands on the north side of the strip and sends an organic tube to the walls of the transport ship and hangar. An acidic ichor breaches the metal walls and alien soldiers pour into the shuttle and mining facility. The nearly extinct alien race intends on getting their artifacts back with only the group and a few brave men of the mining colony standing in their way.<br/><br/>"}, "162260": {"rpgdesigner": ["Mark Gedak"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Alternate Class Abilities", "rpgartist": ["Matt Morrow"], "rpgproducer": ["Perry Fehr", "Mark Gedak"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2073916.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Purple Duck Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Purple Duck Storeroom"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2073916_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>&ldquo;In a nondescript dwelling, down a dusty hallway, past rooms of unclear purpose, there is a door... a door that looks like many others, except for the ancient maroon tint of the aged wood, and, of course, the glowing runes emblazoned on the stones that make up the door-frame.

These beings have agendas of their own and, if not stopped, will seek to control and guide this proud city towards their own, nefarious ends.<br/><br/>This sourcebook will take you through the streets of 12th Century Rouen, to the darkest areas of the city where there are few friends for Guardian Priests and far too many enemies.<br/><br/>"}, "162278": {"rpgartist": ["Paul Bourne"], "rpgitemversion": ["Hardcover Version", "PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Sixth Doctor Sourcebook", "rpgdesigner": ["Alasdair Stuart"], "rpgproducer": ["Paul Bourne", "Gareth Hanrahan", "Jon Hodgson", "Andrew Kenrick", "Dominic McDowall"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2074561.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": ["Whoniverse"], "average": "7", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Doctor Who Roleplaying Game"], "rpgpublisher": ["Cubicle 7 Entertainment"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Modern (Pop Culture)", "Multiverse", "Science Fiction (Time / Dimension Travel)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2074561_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Celebrating the 50th anniversary year of Doctor Who, this Sourcebook explores the Sixth Doctor&rsquo;s adventures on Earth and beyond.

The game commences with the opposing forces (starting on or off table) and advancing towards each other, with intent to give battle and destroy the opposing force. Starting with initial contacts from patrols and/or vanguards prompting their commanders to respond. The main forces are deployed in attempts to seize and/or maintain the initiative. Finally one force is defeated and the victors may attempt pursuit. The rules are primarily designed around this type of game.<br/>b) Scenario &ndash; each player has a force defined for the scenario which may be based on fictional or historical events. The objectives and victory conditions being defined by the scenario.<br/><br/>REPRESENTATIVE SCALES<br/>There are variable ground and troop scales to allow for varying sizes of engagements. So in effect the ground scale will vary from 1:2500 (i.e. 1mm on the table = 2.5m in life) to 1:30,000 (1mm = 30m). However in any game the ground and troop scales are directly proportionate to each other.<br/><br/>The game is broken into bounds of varying length. For game purposes these are expressed are periods of minutes. The activity of all troops within any bound is directly related to the time span of the bound. For example a five minute bound allows all troops to complete five minutes of activities. However a 500 minute bound allows all troops five hundred minutes of activities. The reason for the variability is to allow for those periods where little or no activity occurs to be passed over.<br/><br/>Troops are represented by figurines and or models based on varying size bases.<br/><br/>"}, "162280": {"poll": [], "name": "Cold Infinity", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "boardgameversion": ["Beta 21.07"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Science Fiction"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "Cold Infinity is a tabletop ship-to-ship space combat game, focusing on small engagements at the tactical level.The Main Rulebook and the Ship Systems Book (abbreviated SSB) provide all the rules and tables required<br/>to create and play in virtually any space-faring science fiction universe you can imagine.<br/><br/>"}, "162281": {"rpgdesigner": ["Zzarchov Kowolski"], "rpg": ["Neoclassical Geek Revival"], "statistics": [], "name": "Hark!

Players all start with a car and use the dice to race each other. If you lose your car in a Race you must Borrow, Earn, or Steal another.<br/><br/>GAME SET UP:<br/><br/>Separate the dice and the cards and place them on the table like in diagram 1. Deal 1 Car card to each of the players in the game. Place the other 3 with the pink side up in the middle of the table like it shows on the diagram.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY:<br/><br/>3-4 Player:<br/><br/>All players roll 2 of their qualifying dice for a chance at  the 1st turn. The player with the highest total will get the first turn. In the case of a tie, the players tied will re-roll.<br/><br/>After the order is decided the game play begins.(Turns will continue as the game progresses to the left.)<br/><br/>RACING:<br/><br/>Setting the Qualifying Combo: On the player&rsquo;s turn they are automatically in the dig(the race). Player 1 rolls their 3 qualifying dice to set the combo for the others to get into the race. After the combo is set, player 1 says, &ldquo;On your mark, get set, go!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Qualifying: The other players roll their 3 qualifying dice as quickly as they can to qualify for the dig. Once someone rolls the right combo they yell out that they have it. If there is a tie Player 1 re-rolls another combo and the tied parties re-roll.<br/><br/>Only 2 players race in a dig. Once the qualifying is done the 2 players each draw a Start Stage Card ad place it face down in front of them. They also get the 9 start stage dice (Red, Yellow, &amp; Green) and place them in front of them.<br/><br/>Start the Race: One of the other players not in the race will start the race by saying, &ldquo;On your mark, get set, go!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Starting Stage: Both players then flip over the Starting Stage card and begin to roll the combo&rsquo;s associated with the card. The dice can only be rolled with the same color. Players roll the 3 red dice first and try to roll the combo shown on the card. If the player rolls 1 of the three dice in the combo they move the correct die to the side and continue rolling the other dice until the combo is rolled correctly. Then the player moves onto the yellow dice and finally the green dice.<br/><br/>Fast Start Bonus: The first player to finish the Stage Combo draws a Fast Start Bonus Card. Fast start bonus cards work in two ways, but always help the one that draws the card. The bonus card will either have a plus or minus symbol on the card. If it has a plus it will also show 1 or 2 dice that need to be rolled by their opponent after they have finished rolling their 10 race dice. If the card has a plus the player places the card face up in front of their opponent. If the card has a minus then the player removes 1 or 2 cards from their necessary 10 race dice.<br/><br/>Race Dice: After the players finish rolling the stage dice they move onto the 10 black race dice. As they finish the stage dice the players draw a race dice card and flip it over to reveal the combo they must roll to advance. Just like the starting stage if the player rolls any number of the ten dice in the combo correctly they move the correct dice to the side and continue rolling the other dice until the combo is rolled correctly.<br/><br/>Finish Line Bonus:  Just like the Fast start bonus this card works 2 ways. There is only a plus 1 or a minus 1. If it is a plus one the extra die is shown on the card and their opponent must roll that extra die after they have rolled their 3 finish line dice to win the race.<br/><br/>Finish Line Dice: There are 3 checkered finish line dice. Each player draws a finish line card after they finish their combo on their 10 race dice. The combo for victory is on the card and who ever finishes that combo first wins the race and wins their opponents car and pink(title).<br/><br/>PLAYER WITHOUT A CAR: If a player does not have a car they cannot qualify to race until it is their turn again and they get a car.<br/><br/>NEXT TURN:<br/><br/>After the race play moves to the next player to the left. If they have a car they roll their qualifying dice to initiate qualifying for the next race. If they do not have a car they have one of three chances to get another car. If they get a car they then roll the qualifying dice to initiate a race. If they are unable to secure a car it is the next player&rsquo;s turn.<br/><br/>Borrow a car from Leg Breaker Lou: His car is in the middle of the table face down with his die on top of it. To borrow the car the player must roll the die and land on any number except for Lou&rsquo;s face. If the player rolls Lou&rsquo;s face they are not allowed to borrow the car and their turn is over. However, if they do borrow the car they immediately roll the qualifying combo to initiate a race. Moving forward in the game with Leg Breaker Lou&rsquo;s car; each time the player qualifies for a race they must roll the Leg Breaker Lou die before the race begins. If they roll Lou&rsquo;s face they get their legs broken and must forfeit the car and qualifying is started over for the other players. They must wait until their next turn to get another car. If Leg Breaker Lou takes his car back it is placed face down on the table under his die again.<br/><br/>Steal a Car: The car is in the middle of the table with the Popo die on top of it. To steal the car the player must roll the die and land on any number except for the Popo&rsquo;s face. If the player rolls the Popo&rsquo;s face they are caught and can&rsquo;t steal the car and their turn is over. However, if they do steal the car they immediately roll the qualifying combo to initiate a race. Moving forward in the game with a stolen car; each time the player qualifies for a race they must roll the Popo die before the race begins. If they roll the Popo they get arrested and must forfeit the car and qualifying is started over for the other players. They must wait until their next turn to get another car.<br/><br/>Earn a Car: The car to earn is in the middle of the table face down with 2 dice on it. To earn the car the player must roll the 2 dice and roll 7, 11 or double $. If the player rolls the dice correctly they earn the car and they immediately roll the qualifying dice to initiate a race. If they don&rsquo;t get the correct roll, their turn is over and it is the next player&rsquo;s turn.<br/><br/><br/>    IF A PLAYER ALREADY HAS A CAR THEY CANNOT TRY TO EARN ONE OF THE CARS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE. <br/><br/><br/>Special Ability:<br/><br/>Each car has a special ability that can be used once in a game. When the player decides to use the special ability, they turn the card sideways. The move is valid for that turn only and cannot be used again by that player during the game. If another player wins the car and uses it in a race they can use the special ability once as well.<br/><br/>WINNING THE GAME:<br/><br/>To win the game a player must hold 4 cars in their garage at the same time. After you have 4 cars you are the Street Dice Champion.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Street Dice"], "age": "6", "name": "Street Dice, Racing For Pinks", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "average": "5", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "162359": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3166962.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Richard Garfield", "Lukas Litzsinger"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamepublisher": ["Edge Entertainment", "Fantasy Flight Games", "Giochi Uniti", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3166962_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Science Fiction"], "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Fantasy Flight Games is proud to announce the upcoming release of The Source, the sixth and final Data Pack in the Lunar Cycle for Android: Netrunner!<br/><br/>In The Source, cyber-explorer Nasir Meidan departs Heinlein for Earth and the relative safety of his apartment.

The rich ones contain &quot;resources&quot; such as Gold, Horses, Iron, Coal, or Timber, which you will work to acquire because of the powerful weapons and cities they can buy.<br/><br/>The action in Lords of Conquest takes place in yearly cycles.  Each year has four of five phases.  During each phase, you will have an opportunity to make decisions in preparation for that year's action.  The first phase is Development, during which you can invest in new weapons and cities.  Development begins during the second year, and is the first phase of all subsequent years.  The other phases are 1. Productions, in which your resource-bearing territories produce wealth; 2. Trading; 3. Shipment, in which you have an opportunity to move either your wealth or some of your forces to a more strategic location; and 4. Conquest, in which you relentlessly assault your neighbors' territories.<br/><br/>Battles between territories are decided on the basis of the number of supporting territories and forces (in the form of weapons, horses, boats and cities) held by each side.  During the year, all the players will have a chance to expand their territories and wealth at the expense of their neighbors.  Ultimately, you become strong enough to start building cities. The first player to build three cities, and successfully defend them for a year, is the winner.  One last word of advice, show no mercy, and expect none!

As if these mythic beasts were not enough, Mythic Monsters: Magical Beasts also discusses the ecological and phenomenological role that magical beasts play in the campaign world, as well as bringing you 10 mythic feats that focus on the bloody and brutal nature of what a BEAST can really do. The 13 magical beasts contained herein, ranging in CR from 1 to 21, are updated for the mythic rules, and when we say updated we mean complete stat blocks, yes, but more than that every one of these massive menaces has its own unique and exciting new mythic abilities, from a mythic leucrotta's lethal bite and compelling lure to the loathsome stench and death gaze of a mythic catoblepas!<br/><br/>"}, "162408": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Michael Dorosh"], "poll": [], "name": "Kruglowka Railway", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "yearpublished": "2014", "boardgameexpansion": ["Advanced Squad Leader"], "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2085776_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["tacticalwargamer.com"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2085776.png", "boardgameversion": ["Revised edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A previously unpublished expansion for the ASL system.

This alabaster-skinned fellow helped Count Rugen (the six-fingered man) in his secret laboratory known as &quot;The Pit of Despair.&quot; He prepared Westley for being tortured by &quot;The Machine&quot; by making sure he was still alive when the Count came down. While being kind to the prisoner, he was sure to explain that there was no hope of escape. &quot;The chains are far too thick. Don't dream of being rescued, either; the only way in is secret. Only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.&quot; He might boil down as a &quot;Talky&quot; (type) with a &quot;Body&quot; (feature), and &quot;Collaborator&quot; (motivation) in the Count's quest to document the limits of the human body...<br/>     Snake Walker from The Muppet Movie (1979). This creepy fellow has one job for the evil Doc Hopper: kill frogs. But he does it with style, so he might come across as &quot;Blocky&quot; (type), &quot;Style&quot; (feature), and &quot;Money bags&quot; might be the best motivation. He wears a head to toe leotard and is highly specialized. Of course, he is stopped by a gigantic Muppet in the end, so he can't have been all *that* good with his job.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Like all Moebius Adventures supplements, Insta-NPCs #4: Henchmen and Minions is designed to be system- and genre-neutral.

Come, discover a new world...!<br/><br/>Ibyron: Island of Discovery is a two-tiered worker placement game wherein players all work the land of a newly-discovered island to build their city the biggest before the other players. Using resource gathering, building construction, exploration and movement mechanisms for the Wilderness Phase, supported by an additive Worker Placement mechamism during the Village Phase, each player will design their own city; each building adding to options in game play.<br/><br/>Each player will start out in the Wilderness phase each round. Actions will consist of using workers tokens on the island tiles, some actions requiring 1 or more workers to be used to perform that action. Players will continue in the Wilderness phase until they run out workers to perform said actions. But if a player finishes their wilderness actions before others, they don't just sit around; they head into the Village phase and may get better placements for their workers on the Village board.<br/><br/>In the Village phase the players will use the same workers that worked for them in the Wilderness phase in this phase as well, but will instead perform money-making, shipbuilding, hiring horses, taxing, and farming actions. Each space in the village requires 1 more worker for each additional use, no matter the player. After the workers are again spent, they go into the rest box to wait to be paid to work again in the following round, in cash or food.<br/><br/>Each building that is constructed will require permanent residence i.e. worker tokens will be used as the building itself. Using worker tokens as buildings will cut down on a player's supply of workers available in following rounds, so knowing when to construct buildings is an important timing constraint.<br/><br/>There is a race to the end game, but getting there will support many strategies. The first player to build a complete working city (all but 1-3 worker tokens used in buildings), wins.<br/><br/>It was heavily inspired by the Splotter games: Roads & Boats and Antiquity. It was not designed to replace those games, but to deeply entrench you for a good 2 hours.

It also has a expanding score track that doubles as the elevator shaft, which affects your build options and game strategy in interesting ways.<br/><br/>It is a small-box strategy game that plays more like a big-box game. The game is highly thematic, from the tongue-in-cheek art style, to the streamlined gameplay that rewards villainous actions.<br/><br/>Command your workers and make judicious use of scant resources to build an optimum lair, and gain the boss's favor.<br/><br/>"}, "162444": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2078304.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Rex Caffee"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Thomas Tamblyn"], "boardgamepublisher": ["The Game Crafter, LLC", "Mine Games"], "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2078304_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Deduction", "Medieval"], "description": "The King&rsquo;s brother is looking for a few good men to help him in his cause to be king.

This is obviously not the way we feel at Critical Hit Publishing. In fact, adding an additional layer of risk and lethality to combat can not only enhance the overall excitement of the game, but it can encourage role play in several ways. Firstly, role playing is enhanced by compelling players to consider alternatives to combat. After all, when there is a chance that a lowly orc could slice off a character&rsquo;s hand in combat, they might want to think twice before simply slaughtering their enemy. Secondly, critical hits can often leave scars or even permanent maimings. It is much more interesting to have a character with an eye patch if you know exactly where and how the eye was lost. Such maimings can offer opportunities for characters to develop prejudices, fears, vendettas, and other personality traits that can become pivotal to the story. And thirdly, critical hits can inspire players to create meaningful descriptions of their actions in combat. So rather than simply saying: &ldquo;I attack with my sword for 6 points of damage,&rdquo; they might describe the swing, the look on their face or the face of their opponent, and the result. When the players really start to enjoy describing their scenes, even a massive fumble becomes a fun part of the story, and I guarantee that it will be discussed long after the game is over. &ldquo;Hey, do you remember that time Borek broke his sword fighting that orc chieftain and he ended up killing him with just the pommel!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Although this was designed to work with many of the popular d20 based fantasy systems, it can easily be adapted for use with almost any system where there is a chance of achieving extraordinary results (good and bad). Naturally, it is impossible to come up with a simple critical chart that will cover any and all possibilities, and so it is expected that the GM or player will adjust the result to be appropriate for the situation. In some cases, certain results may simply not apply. For example, some creatures such as undead and constructs don&rsquo;t bleed, though they could still suffer a drawback when a limb is removed. Some creatures might not have limbs or bones, but might still bleed. Common sense should always supersede the rules.<br/><br/>"}}
