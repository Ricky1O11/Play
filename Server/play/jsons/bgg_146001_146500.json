Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas.<br/><br/>While the tasks on these Mystery cards (along with the locations of otherworldly gates, menacing monsters, and helpful clues) will often inform both your travel plans and the dangers you confront, you can find adventure anywhere in the world...even where you least expect it. It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or, alternatively, build their investigators' personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards. You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city. Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness. You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space.<br/><br/>Should you fail an encounter, the cost is steep. If you are fortunate, you will merely incur physical or mental trauma. However, you might also be compelled to take a Condition card, which represents a specific injury or restriction gained throughout your journey, such as a Leg Injury or Amnesia. You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition &ndash; or maybe you'll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector, and enter into a Dark Pact! Whatever your condition, you would be wise to find a resolution with haste; many conditions have a &quot;reckoning effect&quot; which, if triggered, ensure a much more sinister fate.<br/><br/>All the while, the arrival of the Ancient One approaches. Its malign influence is manifested in Eldritch Horror as you draw Mythos Cards, which govern the appearance of otherworldly gates, fearsome monsters, and other ominous elements. Mythos cards keep your investigators under pressure, introducing new threats, even as the arrival of the Great Old One draws nearer! Since the investigators draw a new Mythos card each round, they're certain to have their hands full battling foul creatures and following up on strange rumors, even as they work to solve their three all-important mysteries.<br/><br/>With twelve unique investigators, two hundred-fifty tokens, and over three hundred cards, Eldritch Horror presents an epic, world-spanning adventure with each and every game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Brazilian First Edition", "Chinese Edition", "English first edition", "French first edition", "German edition", "Hungarian edition", "Italian first edition", "Japanese first edition", "Korean edition", "Polish edition", "Russian first edition", "Spanish first edition"], "average": "7.94421", "name": "Eldritch Horror", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Point to Point Movement", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": ["Eldritch Horror: Cities in Ruin", "Eldritch Horror: Forsaken Lore", "Eldritch Horror: Mountains of Madness", "Eldritch Horror: Signs of Carcosa", "Eldritch Horror: Strange Remnants", "Eldritch Horror: The Dreamlands", "Eldritch Horror: Under the Pyramids"], "usersrated": "15833", "boardgameaccessory": ["Arkham Horror: Figure Stands"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Arkham Horror", "Cthulhu Mythos", "Eldritch Horror", "Solitaire Games"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["1P 086 - The 7th Continent and Lewis &amp; Clark", "39: Boardgame Cthulhu", "5 Minute Initiative - Eldritch Horror", "Allt p\u00e5 ett kort #17 \u2013 Eldritch Horror", "AP Podcast \u2013 Episodio 12: Ascension Rise of Vigil", "Board2Death Podcast Episode 5 - Introductions Round One", "Carnagecast 60: Winter Weirdness 2015", "Cult of the New Board Game Podcast 003 \u2013 10 Games for Essen 2015!", "Ep 37 Randomness", "Ep 44: The Gaming Lifestyle", "Ep. 7 Game Stores", "Episode 19 - The Rules Girl", "Episode 22 - We All Stand Together", "Episode 33 : Gencon 2016 Recap + Interview with Ryan Bruns (Mayday Games)", "Episode 34 : Scythe Review + Interview with Lance \"Undead Viking\" Myxter", "Episode 36 - Eldritch Horror Review &amp; Arkham Horror: LCG Impressions", "Episode 37 :: Mythos Tales Review + Halloween Stories", "Episode 44 - Arkham Horror", "Episode 5 - Interview with Patrick Leder of Leder Games", "Episode 79-- Interviews Galore, some MDM, and John Cusack Top 3 Bum 1", "Episode 83-- Live from GEN CON Part 2-- from the show floor", "Episode Charlie - 2016 Retrospective", "I Officially Give You Permission", "I've Been Diced! episode 71: Mutants, game studies, and 2015 in review", "If You Buy One Game - Relaxing Games", "Il Giocatore - Episodio 7 - Especial Juegos Lovecraft", "Il Giocatore - Episodio 7 - Especial Juegos Lovecraft - Parte 3", "La casa de mi hermano 2\u00d702 (FIFA 15, Eldtrich Horror, Pira\u00f1as, Twin Peaks, \u00bfPel\u00edcula de Tetris?, los troleos de Robert Downey Jr. \u00a1Y m\u00e1s!)", "Low Player Count - Ep 13 - Luck in Games", "Low Player Count - Ep 14 - Free Form", "Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu Review", "Perfect Information Podcast Episode 19 - Stories We Play", "Strange Assembly 125 - The Horror (Brain Burn)", "Strange Assembly 159 - Double Back", "TDT - Episode # 318 - Live from Gen Con 2013", "The Broken Meeple - Episode 42 - The Ultimate Fantasy Question", "The Dice Section 21: Eldritch Horror", "The Game Pit Podcast: Episode 62 - LobSterCon XI Roundtable", "The Game Pit: Episode 27 - Top Ten from 2013", "The Game Pit: Episode 40 - Council Chamber Mega Review of 2014 with Top 5s", "The Game Pit: Episode 44 - Lobstercon", "The Good, The Board, and the Alpha Gamer: Episode 31 Cooperative Games", "The Good, The Board, and The Ugly Episode 5: \u201cGod does not play dice\u201d -Albert Einstein", "The Polyhedron Collider Cast Episode 8", "Vox Republica 091: Arkham\u2019s Finest - An Interview with Richard Launius"]}, "146023": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1739087.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Kyle Pollex", "Phillip J.

To connect tiles players must match the numbers on the edge of the tiles played with the number on the tiles it will be connecting to. Some of the tiles have olive branches on their edges instead of numbers. Olive branches must connect to other olive branches. Since there are many olive branches, they make it easier to connect tiles.  There are also wild tiles that have edges that may count as any number or an olive branch. One other way tiles can be matched is if the player is able to combine the tiles to create one of the three verses on the Message Card he was given at the beginning of the game. For example, a player may have the verse Matthew 5:16 on his message card. He could connect a tile with 16 on one of its edges to a tile that has Matthew in its center and 5 on one its edges to create Matthew 5:16. <br/>The objective of the game is for the players to create all three verses on their message cards and use the clues in those verses to guess the secret word on the other side of the card. The first player to create all three verses and guess his secret word is the winner. Even if a player can guess the secret word before they complete all three of the verses he must complete the other verses to win.<br/><br/>The following is from the back of the box - An archeologist, Dr. S needs your help to decipher and uncover secret words. He needs assistance sifting through ancient tiles and linking them together to gain clues to a message. Dr. S has started a Log Book detailing the links between the tiles.

And at the most basic level, that&rsquo;s all it is. But many things in art and fiction are metaphor for sex, and sex itself is a metaphor for many things. This is a game that explores those boundaries, and uses them to allow the players to break down the entire arena that is sex, and see it as it is, as interactions between people.<br/><br/>"}, "146071": {"poll": [], "name": "Dungeon!", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Apple II edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["TSR"], "videogamegenre": ["Maze"], "videogameplatform": ["Apple II"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["TSR"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Electronic Games Magazine noted in the January 1984 edition that &quot;up to eight adventurers can explore a multi-level fortress in this electronic version of the conventional boardgame which has proven to be a family/social favorite.

Mass and its surrounding areas.<br/><br/>Players will place their workers at different locations to gain types of resources that will help fight the terrors that will visit Arkham.  You'll collect lore, arcana,  and research resources, in addition to gaining the trust of cultists who will help usher in some of the more advanced terrors to Arkham. You must know your enemy and their plans if you wish to defeat them.<br/><br/>The game will have a built in time mechanic that will unleash unspeakable terrors on the town unless the players choose to confront it first.<br/><br/>The eldritch deck will contain 3 levels of terror which will visit the town.  Each time the game is played the deck will vary, as a certain number of cards is added to each of the three levels, changing with the number of players. <br/>Example. There are 18 level 1 terrors, in a typical game there will be only 6 in the level 1 deck. When setting up the game players will randomly choose 6 terrors and shuffle them.  Ensuring that you'll always have a fresh, exciting game as you never know what horrors may come to town.<br/><br/>Battling an ancient evil one won't always be easy, but will undoubtably increase in difficulty as the game progresses.<br/><br/>When battle commences, a player will flip the top of the eldritch deck and have to have the corresponding resources to defeat the terror. <br/>Defeating the terrors that confront Arkham will earn you valuable Elder signs (victory points) as well as possibly gaining additional resources.  Encountering these ancient terrible entities won't be easy on your psyche though, defeating or even just encountering these awful creatures can affect your sanity.<br/><br/>Collect too many insanity cubes and one of your workers will be eliminated from the game and have to check in to Arkham Asylum.<br/><br/>The game progresses through all three levels of the Eldritch deck, culminating with a final battle with an Elder god.<br/><br/>When a player defeats the final Elder God in the deck the game ends and Arkham is temporarily safe.  The player who has gained the most Elder Signs will claim victory.<br/><br/>In the advanced game, players will become famous personalities from the Lovecraft Mythos, gaining benefits and even possibly penalties based on the chosen characters.<br/><br/>I am Providence will be deeply rooted in the Lovecraft Mythos, never straying from the original source material. Many authors have continued the work of HP Lovecraft, expanding his Mythos and building a world of terror. We will focus solely on his writing and works for the base game.  (Though who knows of we'll see a return to Arkham in expansions).<br/><br/>Artistically, I am Providence will capture the theme and essence of the late 60's and early 70's American International Pictures movie one sheets.  The goal is to present I am Providence as a lost movie title in their series of films that were based on the works of Poe, though their films &quot;The Dunwhich  Horror', 'The Haunted Palace'  and 'Die, Monster, Die' borrowed heavy from Lovecraft.<br/><br/>"}, "146076": {"rpgartist": ["Kapitan B.

You attack by shoving your opponent. You can Goomba-Stomp monsters for a stun/knockback. You can be stunned too.

But a very versatile item. Like magic items in Rogue, all of the runes start off unidentified. You have to cast them to find out what they do or use an identify rune. Unless of course you have the chaos rune, which will always have an unknown identity.<br/><br/>HOW VERSATILE?<br/><br/>Say you have the heal rune. If you eat it, you get healed. You throw it, it heals what it hits. You cast it on armour and it heals you slowly when worn. You repeat cast it on an item and you improve the effect, so you better collect a lot of that rune and cast it on a decent item for it to be worth it. Effects are instant or temporary, unless they are cast upon items. Thus the question, how does one best use this spell?<br/><br/>Of course I don't tell the player what the exact effects of runes are, leaving it up to the player if they want to be stupid enough to cast a bleed rune on their armour or a heal rune on their sword.<br/><br/>And there is some other unexpected effects too, magic is be highly unpredictable.

All data sheets take account of revisions of armament at various times.<br/><br/>Time scales are 6 minutes for a game turn, combat is regulated by the use of 5,000 yard range bands, which provide gun penetration values and torpedo hit modifiers. Armour protection is converted to an armour class on specific areas of the ship, taking account of the armour type and date. Damage represents those hits that cause significant damage to the target, and critical hits cause degradation of the combat effectiveness of ships. Command and crew quality are important and ships are commanded and crewed by men of mixed ability, generated using systems which players will recognise from other A&amp;A titles.<br/><br/>The chance of critical damage is now keyed to the &quot;size of the bang&quot; involved, and the number of guns firing (in the case of ships). More guns means a more chances of causing critical damage, and larger shells/bombs mean a higher chance that critical damage will occur. Higher chances also mean that the damage effects may also be more extensive, because we have expanded the way in which the critical damage system works.<br/><br/>Play follows a sequence using initiative. The winner of initiative chooses which side will move a squadron first. Movement then alternates between the two sides. During Movement the slowest elements finish their movement first, so the order is all submarines, then all ships, finally all aircraft. The winner of initiative then shoots with a squadron first, and then play alternates. Combat actions ignore the type of element involved.<br/><br/>Movement takes into account the manoeuvrability of ships of different sizes. Gunnery takes into account the crew skill of the firing ship, interference by shooting from other vessels, the size of the target and the number of guns firing. Hits will cause structural damage and may also cause critical hits, which will degrade the combat effectiveness of the vessel. As ships get more damaged, there is a possible effect on morale, which may cause formations to withdraw to lick their wounds.<br/><br/>"}, "146111": {"poll": [], "name": "Card Counting: A Strategic Player vs. Player Game", "playingtime": "25", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Press Your Luck"], "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "25", "boardgamecategory": ["Math", "Party Game"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "25", "description": "Players place bets on their own game board.

This section provides inspirational exhortations, reverse engineering anecdotes, and step-by-step methods to unblock stumped scene callers. Join our vanguard of early adopters as they analyze the drama token economy, ponder the paradox of low-pressure GMing, hack the scene calling process, and raid the engine for prequel potential.<br/><br/>As soon as our crowdfunding backers first checked out DramaSystem in draft form, they saw that it cried out for a live action application. Emily Care Boss brilliantly gets the game off its feet and into the big play space in the DramaSystem LARP Rules chapter. She lays out two distinct modes of play, of varying degrees of Nordicness. From the character-making process to the debrief in the pub afterwards, she's got you covered.<br/><br/>Then it's time to once again gorge on the breadth of DramaSystem's applicability with a further cascade of Series Pitches. Our international super-team of contributors spans schools and generations of gaming. Showing off the game's flair for the historical, they take you to 10th century Iceland, the Spanish Reconquista, 30s Shanghai, and the American Civil War. With robot doctors, transhuman transformations, and genetic hegemony, they exploit DramaSystem's suitability for classic, idea-driven SF. Those looking to get crazy will find improbability-powered mecha, Tsarist steampunk, and a war in heaven. Literary inspiration abounds, from the tearooms of Jane Austen's Bath and a revolution against Robert W. Chambers' Yellow Sign, to wizards suffering middle-aged despond as faculty of their magical alma mater.<br/><br/>In other words, Blood on the Snow contains more options for play than any one group could ever exhaust. Thank goodness there's a MasterClass entry helping you to pick your next destination for drama, whether you find it in the glossy world of England's equestrian set, the rural grit of a declining town in the American heartland, or a good old fashioned fantasy city chockablock with elves, dwarves, and orcs.<br/><br/>"}, "146119": {"poll": [], "name": "Amg!

Each robot on your team shares energy with each other, so moving and attacking with one will limit what the rest of your team can do during your turn.

The first player to do slams the bell, revels in the soul-brightening &quot;ding&quot;, then (if correct), claims the card. Someone then reveals the next card, and the players start shuffling cups once again.<br/><br/>Once all the cards have been claimed, whoever holds the most cards wins!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Baltic first edition", "Chinese / English edition", "Chinese first edition", "Dutch first edition", "English North America first edition", "English second edition", "French Canadian edition", "French first edition", "German first edition", "Greek first edition", "Hebrew first edition", "Italian first edition", "Nordic edition 2014", "Polish edition", "Ukrainian first edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "name": "Speed Cups", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Building"], "age": "6", "boardgameexpansion": ["Speed Cups: Fan-Edition"], "usersrated": "582", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Party Games"], "average": "6.2559", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Essen 2013 - Amigo Games"]}, "146151": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1738081.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Michael Feldk\u00f6tter"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Bj\u00f6rn Pertoft"], "boardgamepublisher": ["AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH", "Giochi Uniti"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1738081_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice"], "description": "The player mice in K&auml;se W&uuml;rfeln want to stack cheese as high as they can.

Players place tiles strategically to a shared game board to cut timber, quarry stone, plant fields of wheat, and fill pastures with fat sheep. Players then use these resources to erect buildings on their own village boards, attempting to complete rows and columns for population points. Whoever can build the biggest and most prosperous town will end up with the biggest population and win the game!<br/><br/>New Haven is a tile-laying game with a drafting component. The center board is the land between the player villages from which resources will be gathered. Players select from their two hidden tiles and play on this board to generate available value in some of the four resources. Once per game, each player can get a shipment which delivers a large value of one specific resource type.<br/><br/>This value is then used by the player to play building tokens on his personal village board. However, he can play only building tokens already owned behind his player screen, with restrictions on how buildings must be arranged. He can elect to play a token face down for more flexibility, but this means a lower score if he successfully completes that row or column of buildings.<br/><br/>Once a player is done building, any value he hasn't used is available for his opponents to use to build! Thus, the goal when placing resource tiles is to generate just enough for what is needed, not the most that can possibly be created. Finally, the player drafts new building tokens for use on future turns; plan your creation and consumption of resources to perfectly match your needs, and you'll be rewarded with additional tokens.<br/><br/>The base game lasts ten turns, and the player who attracts the most colonists to his village by completing roads and avenues of buildings wins the game.<br/><br/>New Haven plays well with 2, 3, or 4 players, lasting about 15 minutes per player, with a bit more time needed for learning games. The game includes a side B game board with some twists, as well as rule variants that can make the gameplay either more forgiving or more strategic.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "6.55102", "name": "New Haven", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Tile Placement"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["New Haven: Charters"], "usersrated": "343", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games", "Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Colonial Theme"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Carnagecast 49: New Haven", "Episode 77 Origins preview, Buonocore drops by, and Xmen chat (spoilers)"]}, "146159": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Apocalypse World"], "poll": [], "name": "The Wrangler", "rpgdesigner": ["Tim Franzke"], "rpgproducer": ["Tim Franzke"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1738615.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Adult / Mature", "Science Fiction (Post Apocalypse)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Apocalypse World Character Playbooks"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1738615_t.png", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>We each contain a ruthless predator within, call it ambition or rage but it is there.

If you plan your ways cleverly and have a little bit of luck, you'll survive the volcanic eruption as the rescuing hero!<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with a team of 3-5 researchers (depending on the number of players) and a set of randomly selected terrain tiles that collectively have at least five movement points; the more jungle spaces on a tile, the more movement points it provides. On a player's turn, he must play all of his tiles in any order he wants, either placing them on the game board to expand the terrain on which players can move or spending the movement points to move his researchers to orthogonally adjacent spaces (1 point to enter jungle, 2 points to enter water, 16,000 points to enter mountain &mdash; actually, you can't enter a mountain space). If his researcher enters a space with an artifact, he then drags that artifact with him as he moves. If his researcher reaches a boat, he fills as many seats as possible with artifacts, then hits the water. Sorry, chumps!<br/><br/>At the end of his turn, he draws new tiles &mdash; and if he pulls a lava tile from the bag, he places it on the board immediately. Lava flows away from the central cone, with each tile indicating the side of the volcano from which it flows. If lava hits established terrain, it covers that terrain; if it hits researchers and artifacts, it covers them, too. Players continue taking turns until someone has no researchers left on the island, whether due to them leaving the island or donning a lava blanket. Everyone else takes one final turn, then players score, collecting 3 points per saved researcher, 1-3 points for each artifact, and -1 point for each empty space on the boats they used. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>In the advanced game, players don't return tiles to the bag when they use them for movement points. Instead they start the game with four action or task cards in hand. They can play as many action cards as they wish on a turn to help their researchers cross mountains, swim faster, or helicopter to safety, but they have only four for the entire game. The game now ends when a player has no researchers or no tile remain in the bag. In addition to their other points, players now score for completed task cards, earning points for specific combinations of artifacts or for taking a certain boat. Again, the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual first edition"], "name": "Mauna Kea", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Tile Placement"], "average": "5.58286", "usersrated": "154", "age": "10", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Essen 2013 - HUCH &amp; friends", "Garrett's Games 391 - Prosperity and Mauna Kea"]}, "146189": {"rpgartist": ["Raven Cornelissen", "Little Ms. Spooky"], "rpg": ["Monsterhearts"], "statistics": [], "name": "Skins for the Skinless", "rpgdesigner": ["Topher Gerkey"], "rpgproducer": ["Topher Gerkey", "Matt Strickling"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1739423.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version 1.0"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Modern Urban Fantasy)", "Horror", "Modern (Pop Culture)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1739423_t.png", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>A collection of five Monsterheart playbooks, including MC &quot;Under the Skin&quot; advice:<br/><br/>     The Beast - They call you frigid.

As battles are won and lost, players gain Victory cards, Victory Points, or the ability to upgrade their army.

Next, players choose a Goblin Guild consisting of 25 units. In addition to the starting units of each Guild, players have 12 draft points to use in order to draft additional units to create their own unique army. All remaining units that are not drafted are combined to create the Upgrade deck.<br/><br/>Players will compete in battle to gain 5 valuable Victory cards. Players will secretly set up their army's battle formation behind a Battle Screen. After shuffling their unit cards,  players will draw 5 cards into their hand. These 5 cards are then set up into a battle formation consisting of 1-3 units in the first row, 1-2 units in the second, and an optional 1 unit in the third combat row. Once all players' formations are complete, players remove their Battle Screens and combat begins. Players may first recruit any available units to their army, and may then choose to activate 1 combat skill per round. Next, damage between opposing Guilds is declared and resolved. As units take damage and are defeated, they are removed from combat and are placed in a player&rsquo;s discard pile. Combat continues until one Guild is left standing, with the winner gaining the first Victory card and its benefits. Players who lose the combat round may chose to upgrade a unit in their army. Once the 5th Victory card has been won, the player with the most Victory Points is declared the winner.<br/><br/>Who will be victorious?

GOAL<br/>The goal of the game is to be the first one to play all dice away from your cup.<br/><br/>2. GAME TERMS<br/>Value: the value of the numbers on a die from low to high is 2-3-4-5-6-1.<br/>Joker: number 1 on the die is the joker and can be considered to be any number from 1 to 6. A thrown number 1 can also be played as a 1, in which case it is valued higher than a 6. This applies to all game modes of THINKABOXIN.<br/>Bid: a gamble or bluff on the total amount of dice of a certain value that are underneath all players&rsquo; dice cups (including one&rsquo;s own cup).<br/>Raise: raising a bid means that EITHER the amount of dice is raised (e.g. raising four twos to five twos, etc.) OR that the value of the aforementioned amount of dice is raised (raising three fives to three sixes or three ones) OR that both are raised (raising five fours to seven sixes, etc.).<br/>Lift: the player who calls a bid into question, lifts his own dice cup. Afterwards, all players (including the player whose bid had been called into question) lift their cups in order to check who is right through counting the amount of dice with the value named in the last bid.<br/>Won dice: after each round all players &ndash; except the player who was not right &ndash; can get one die out of their dice cups and put it away.  The amount of dice put away is called won dice. Only the dice that can be put away from one&rsquo;s own cup count as won dice. <br/>Round: one played round (ends when the winning players have been able to put away one die).<br/>Set: all played and counted rounds.<br/><br/>3. GENERAL GAME RULES THINKABOXIN<br/>&bull; Before the start of the game, each player always receives a personal dice cup containing 4 dice.<br/>&bull; All players simultaneously shake their cups with dice, and each player looks underneath his own cup to see what he has thrown himself.<br/>&bull; Players may not ever see one another&rsquo;s dice (except for when cups are lifted).<br/>&bull; The youngest player starts the very first round. The rounds after that, the loser of the previous round or set begins bidding.<br/>&bull; Whoever starts a round always determines the playing direction. The player determines this through making a bid to either the player to the left or right of him.<br/>&bull; A bid that has been placed cannot be withdrawn or changed.<br/>&bull; Once a bid has been placed, the turn of whoever placed the bid is over, and the next player&rsquo;s turn is at hand.<br/>&bull; The next player either raises this bid in the given playing direction or lifts his cup if he takes the current bid into question.<br/>&bull; Raise: raising a bid means that EITHER the amount of dice is raised (e.g. raising four twos to five twos, etc.) OR that the value of the aforementioned amount of dice is raised (raising three fives to three sixes or three ones) OR that both are raised (raising five fours to seven sixes, etc.).<br/>&bull; Raising a bid has to be done in the given playing direction.<br/>&bull; In case of a raise, the previous bid no longer needs to be kept in mind.<br/>&bull; When someone lifts the cup to indicate that he takes the previous player&rsquo;s bid into question, this action is final and cannot be undone.<br/>&bull; When the bid has been taken into question and one cup has been lifted, all players should then lift their cups, and the dice with the values named in the last bid will be counted.<br/>&bull; When more than or precisely the amount of dice named in the bid are present, the bidder is right and the lifter is not right.<br/>&bull; When fewer than the amount of dice named in the bid are present, the bidder is not right and the lifter is right.<br/>&bull; Whoever is not right is not allowed to get any die out of his cup, all other players are allowed to get one die out of their cups.<br/>&bull; The won dice that have been put away from the cups have to be placed in front of the dice cups on the table in a way that is visible for all players.<br/>&bull; The player who was not right starts the next round and can determine once again the playing direction through placing a bid in the desired direction. <br/>&bull; The player(s) who manages to be the first to place all the dice from his cup in front of him on the table wins the set.<br/>&bull; If dice roll out of one or more players&rsquo; cups or dice end up lying on top of one another, then these players are The Donkey. This means that all other players can get one die out of their cups. Afterwards, all players shake their cups and the bidding can be started anew by the one (or those) that is (or are) The Donkey.<br/>GAME TERM: KNOCK-OUT RACE<br/>Unlike stated under the GENERAL GAME RULES THINKABOXIN, a knock-out race does not stop when one or more players have played away all their dice from their cups. During a knock-out race, a round will continue until there is one loser left. This loser will be eliminated from the game and barred from further participation to this part. The next set will continue with the remaining players, and the last but one loser starts the round. This will go on until one winner remains.<br/><br/>4. GENERAL TIPS AND TRICKS THINKABOXIN<br/>&bull; At all times, keep an eye on how many dice are in the game at the start of each round. At the start of a 4-player game, 4 x 4 dice = 16 dice are lying underneath the cups. The lowest possible bid is in this case 1 die with value 2 (one two) and the highest possible bid 16 dice with value 1 (sixteen ones).<br/>&bull; It could be useful for the player whose turn is at hand to base his bid on his own dice. True bluffers do not do this. They do not care about which dice they have, and wildly undertake hit-or-miss bids. These unpredictable players give the game an extra dimension. <br/>&bull; Determining the playing direction upon doing the first bid of a round can create a tactical advantage when placing a calculated and sharp bid towards the player who is ahead of the rest of the players.<br/>&bull; When there are 2 dice remaining in the game and these are both ones, the player who at that moment would bid &lsquo;two ones&rsquo; wins, rather than the player who would bid &lsquo;two sixes&rsquo;. The joker is namely also the highest value on a die. In this specific case, both players should of course both have a 1 underneath their dice cups.<br/><br/>5. GAME MODES<br/>Nuggets<br/><br/>&bull; The GENERAL GAME RULES THINKABOXIN apply to NUGGETS.<br/>&bull; Each player receives 10 nuggets before the start of the game.<br/>&bull; Each player shakes his dice in the cup, and the first player of each set can, after checking the dice underneath his cup, determine what the stake for each player will be for this set.<br/>&bull; This stake is either 2 or 4 nuggets.<br/>&bull; All other players will then place the same amount of nuggets as their stake.<br/>&bull; If one or more players do not have any remaining nuggets and are out of the game, the stake for the other remaining players will always be the total amount of nuggets of the player with the lowest supply of nuggets. In that case, the stake could be more than 4 nuggets.<br/>&bull; When a player has no remaining nuggets to put in as stake, the game is over for this player and he can no longer play.<br/>&bull; The pool of nuggets will only be distributed when one or more players have played away all their dice from their cups.<br/>&bull; When there are multiple winners, the pool of nuggets is to be distributed fairly between them.<br/>&bull; Any possible remainder of nuggets will stay in the pool for the next set. When two players win with an uneven amount of nuggets in the pool, the remainder will stay in the pool for the next set.<br/>&bull; The player who has won all nuggets is the winner of NUGGETS.<br/><br/>Goldrush<br/><br/>&bull; The GENERAL GAME RULES THINKABOXIN apply to GOLDRUSH.<br/>&bull; One player (the secretary) fills in the players&rsquo; names (in sitting order) and keeps the score for each round on the score notepad.<br/>&bull; 10 rounds are played in total.<br/>1st set = 1 round, everyone starts with 1 die in their cups.<br/>2nd and 3rd set = 2 sets, everyone starts with 2 dice in their cups.<br/>4th until 6th set = 3 sets, everyone starts with 3 dice in their cups.<br/>7th until 10th set = 4 sets, everyone starts with 4 dice in their cups.<br/>&bull; A set is won when one or more players have played away all of their dice from their cups. At that point, all won dice for each player are counted and noted under the players&rsquo; names for the relevant set.<br/>&bull; The running scores are continually counted by the secretary and announced to the other players.<br/>&bull; The final score is announced by the secretary, declaring who the (tied) player numbers 1 and 2 are.<br/>&bull; The (tied) player numbers 1 and 2 are pitted against one another in a final knock-out-race.<br/>&bull; The winner of this final is the winner of GOLDRUSH.<br/><br/>The Next Sheriff<br/><br/>&bull; The GENERAL GAME RULES THINKABOXIN apply to THE NEXT SHERIFF.<br/>&bull; During the entire game one-on-one duels are played. Each player duels one another once, until one of the players has played away all of his dice.<br/>&bull; One player (the secretary) fills in the players&rsquo; names from left to right and, in the same order, from top to bottom. The secretary also keeps the score for each duel (the amount of won dice per player) on the score notepad.<br/>&bull; The secretary determines at what time which player plays against which player.<br/>&bull; The amount of dice that have been put away from the cup is the amount of scored points. This result is noted directly after each duel by the secretary.<br/>&bull; After all players have played against one another once, the total amount of won dice is counted and noted in the totals column on the right-hand side (Total amount of won dice).<br/>&bull; The score from the totals column is filled in at the lower section (in case two players have a tied score, the winner is defined as that player who beat the other player in a duel). The resulting tournament schedule works in the following way:<br/>With 3 players: no. 1 directly granted place in finals. No. 2 plays against no. 3 for place in finals.<br/>With 4 players: no. 1 plays against no. 4 for place in finals. No. 2 plays against no. 3 for place in finals.<br/>With 5 players: no. 1 directly granted place in finals. Winner of no. 2 against no. 5 plays against winner of no. 3 against no. 4 for place in finals.<br/>With 6 players: no. 1 plays against no. 6 for place in finals. Winner of no. 2 against no. 5 plays against winner of no. 3 against no. 4 for place in finals.<br/>&bull; The winner of the last finals is the winner of THE NEXT SHERIFF.<br/><br/>Last Man Standing<br/><br/>&bull; The GENERAL GAME RULES THINKABOXIN apply to LAST MAN STANDING.<br/>&bull; A knock-out race is being played during the entire game (see explanation KNOCK-OUT RACE).<br/>&bull; One player (the secretary) fills in the players&rsquo; names and notes during each set which player has been eliminated and crosses that player&rsquo;s name out on the score notepad.<br/>&bull; The winner of the knock-out race is the Last Man Standing.<br/><br/>Rattlesnakes<br/><br/>&bull; The goal of this game is to be the first to place all your snake parts (20) on the game board.<br/>&bull; RATTLESNAKES is played on the RATTLESNAKES game board with 20 snake parts per player.<br/>&bull; The GENERAL GAME RULES THINKABOXIN apply to RATTLESNAKES.<br/>&bull; Each player receives 20 snake parts before the start of RATTLESNAKES.<br/>&bull; The amount of snake parts that can be placed on the board per set is determined by the amount of dice won by the player per set.<br/>&bull; After a played set, the player with the fewest won dice is the first to start placing his snake. In case of an equal amount of won dice, the player who was the last to lose can start placing. He also determines in which direction the other players are allowed to place their snake parts.<br/>&bull; If a player, for example, has won 3 dice in a set, he can then place 3 snake parts on the game board. Afterwards, it is the next player&rsquo;s turn to place his snake parts.<br/>&bull; A snake always begins from one of six snake head squares on the game board, which can be freely chosen by the players.<br/>&bull; Only the first snake part placed by the player can be put on a &lsquo;snake head&rsquo; square. Afterwards, no snake parts can be put on a &lsquo;snake head&rsquo; square.<br/>&bull; Each square on the game board can be used only once.<br/>&bull; The snake parts that have not been placed yet must be placed in front of you in a way that is visible to all players, so that it is at all times clear which player is ahead or behind on the rest (this can influence the tactics of placing snake parts).<br/>&bull; Placing snake parts on the game board can be done in any desired direction via an adjacent square.<br/>&bull; The final snake part that is placed (the head) in a set is placed (temporarily) upright, so that it is clear from which square the snake slithers onwards into the next set.<br/>&bull; When crossing your own snake (through removing one snake part after winning a set with 4 won dice), the crossed part becomes the head (no extra snake part is therefore placed).<br/>&bull; When snake parts can be placed anew, the snake head is laid flat and it is from this square that new parts must be placed.<br/>&bull; The next round will be started by the player who was allowed to place his snake parts the first in the previous set. He once again determines the playing direction through placing his bid to either the left or right (note: a tactical advantage can be gained through this action).<br/>&bull; Once a player has chosen to go into a snake pit by having a snake part stand on an orange square, that player is then obliged to let his next snake part appear at another snake pit on an orange square.<br/>&bull; It is forbidden to immediately re-use an already used snake pit. When going out of a snake pit, the snake has to slither ahead on the regular squares. Players can, however, use multiple different snake pits within one game.<br/>&bull; NO snake parts are placed on a snake pit, as snake pits only serve as a passage to and from another snake pit.<br/>&bull; When winning a set (all dice are out of the dice cup) the player (or players) has the following options:<br/>EITHER place 4 snake parts,<br/>OR remove 1 snake part of your own,<br/>OR remove 1 adjacent snake part of your opponent (this snake part is then given back to the player in question). However, this cannot be done to a snake belonging to a player who has also won this set with 4 dice.<br/>&bull; The player who is the first to put his entire snake on the board wins RATTLESNAKES!<br/>&bull; Should multiple players manage to put their entire snakes on the board within one set, a final round is organised for these players in the form of a knock-out race (see explanation KNOCK-OUT RACE).<br/><br/>"}, "146210": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1746755.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ric Green"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1988", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Cam de Leon"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "Surf Trip Inc."], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1746755_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Sports"], "description": "Four surfers travel the world to see who can be the first to get $500 and 3 sponsors.<br/><br/>Players roll to move around the board, each space giving or taking cash or movement bonuses.

Players then play spare parts from their hand to match the costs of zombies they are building. Players can trade spare parts with other players on their turn to try to get the parts they need.

The first one to pillage all of the villages and take the daughters of their thanes to his home port as warranty of recognition of jarls authority will be declared the winner. To do this, the jarls will have to brave the stormy northern seas, battling each other along the way, and watch out for the sea monster that lurks beneath the waves! The most cunning and vehement of them all &ndash; that is, the one who the Gods favor &ndash; will throw a great feast and become the Konung of the North.<br/><br/>Vikings: Warriors of the North is a card-based game. Players draw cards from a common deck. Wind cards are used for moving a drakkar around the board that depicts the cold north sea. Players can move the drakkar to a village (to sack it), to an enemy drakkar (to attack it), or to their own ports, where they can throw a feast for the Gods.<br/><br/>A player can also use cards to drastically change the gameplay: He can increase his chances in an attack, re-roll the dice, sail further with his drakkar, or steal cards from an enemy's hand. All of those cards represent story events that have tangible effects within the game. Some cards represent heroes who can become part of a drakkar's crew. As long as a hero stays on the ship, he grants his owner a permanent effect. Each drakkar has three open slots for heroes. Daughters of the thanes are also considered heroes, so they also occupy drakkar slots. With only three slots, players have to think hard about their crew composition.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player can play any number of cards from his hand and take one action: attack, sack a village, throw a feast, etc. Attacks are resolved by a roll of a six-sided (d6) die, although many cards influence the combat result, so each battle is exciting.<br/><br/>When a player take three daughters of the thanes (each of a different, opposing player color) and brings them to his own port, the game is over and that player wins. The gameplay is fast, furious and fun, full of twists and comebacks; it really lets you feel like a Viking chieftain!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "Polish edition"], "average": "5.34615", "name": "Vikings: Warriors of the North", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Pick-up and Deliver"], "age": "14", "usersrated": "235", "boardgamefamily": ["Vikings"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The Game Pit: Episode 14.2 - Essen Spiel 2013 Special"]}, "146276": {"poll": [], "name": "Das kleine Fussballquiz", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Das kleine Quiz", "Sports: Football / Soccer"], "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1776343_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["HUCH! & friends"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1776343.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["German first edition"], "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Sports", "Trivia"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>The small quiz line of HUCH! &amp; friends gets sporty!

Two to four summoners encounter each other in the Tash-Kalar arena, either in teams or each on his own, and prove their skill and strategy in a short but intense battle. By clever deployment of their minions, they create magic patterns for summoning powerful beings, and then use those to destroy their opponent&rsquo;s forces or to prepare patterns for the ultimate legendary beings.<br/><br/>The game includes four different factions, each with a unique deck of beings to summon and one deck of legendary creatures. Players take turns placing their common pieces on the board, and if they succeed in creating patterns depicted on one of the cards in hand, they may play it. When played, the card summons a particular being and allows the player to perform an effect described on the card: a giant destroys neighboring pieces, a knight moves through enemy pieces, a warlord orders previously placed pieces to move and fight, an enchantress converts enemy pieces to player's own color, etc. After that, the player discards the card and the summoned being turns into a motionless piece which may be used in patterns for summoning other beings &ndash; or even be awakened and moved into combat by the effects of other cards.<br/><br/>Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends offers two game modes. In the standard mode you score points for fulfilling various quests set by the Arena Masters: controlling certain points or areas of the arena, destroying a number of enemy pieces in a single turn, performing a certain combination of summonings, etc.<br/><br/>In melee mode, your only goal is to entertain the crowd. You do that by destroying your opponents and making them beg (i.e., making them use the catch-up mechanisms) and by summoning legendary beings. After all, people want to see a dragon! Both modes can be played as a two-player duel or as a team game with teammates sharing pieces and legendary cards, but with each controlling his own faction. (The game includes a duplicate of one faction in a different color.) The melee mode can also be played as a fierce free-for-all battle, but don't expect alliances; to achieve a good score, you need to destroy all opponents evenly as you track points scored on each opponent separately, and your lowest score is your final score.<br/><br/>The rules of Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends are simple and easy to understand, but as you start to discover the tactics and are able to anticipate the opponent's moves and patterns, it turns into a real clash of wits.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Chinese first edition", "Czech second edition", "English first edition", "English second edition", "French first edition", "German first edition", "Italian first edition", "Polish edition", "Spanish first edition"], "name": "Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Partnerships", "Pattern Building", "Tile Placement", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": ["Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends \u2013 Everfrost", "Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends \u2013 Legendary Summoner Promo", "Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends \u2013 Nethervoid"], "usersrated": "3891", "boardgameaccessory": ["Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends \u2013 The Upgrade Pack"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games", "Strategy Games"], "average": "7.26066", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["AP Podcast \u2013 Episodio 16: Essen 2013", "Ep 039 \u2013 Fleet, Origins, and Pokemon Go!", "Episode 11: House Rules", "Episode 13: Seasons/Best and Worst for 2013", "Episode 15: Voluspa and Tash-Kalar", "Episode 21 -- Rant!

One of the nations, in an attempt to win the war single-handedly, not only opened a portal to another theoretical world, but harnessed its power into a weapon. Random dimensional portals opened, letting through terrible monsters that slaughtered thousands, and the portals&rsquo; energy warped the land and mutated normal animals into monsters.<br/><br/>It also mutated the human race, rendering them frail and incapable of producing offspring for over 40 years. The war continued until the human race was decimated by casualties or by being eaten and killed by the various monsters. The best and brightest of human kind were stuck in a shuttle and sent to Cloud Nation, a floating continent, where they developed genetic advances that allowed them to cure themselves of the breeding pathogens before everyone else that lived below. It also gave them insight into the monsters that plagued the world.<br/><br/>The regular people left behind made the best of their lives, living off the scraps sent down from Cloud Nation. Some areas are still rampaged by rogue militia groups or street gangs not scared to shed blood, but he majority of the people have agreed that violence between humans is a bad idea, especially with such a small population that is still attempting to reach 1/100 of what it used to be. Instead, the people use special collars to control the monsters, settling their differences by seeing who can train their monsters the best. The first collars were just another piece of rubbish dropped from above, but the technology has spread and each of the remaining nations has their own tweaked gloves to interface with the collars.<br/><br/>Now, after 100 years of silence, Cloud Nation has invited the best trainers in each nation to compete for the world monster trainer trophy. Not only is winning a trophy worth more than the average person&rsquo;s entire estate a huge deal, but the chance to see Cloud Nation with your own eyes is too much to pass up.<br/><br/>"}, "146369": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Tengu!", "rpgdesigner": ["Daron Woodson"], "rpgproducer": ["Daron Woodson"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1743305.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Abandoned Arts"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Amazing Races"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1743305_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The Amazing Races PDFs introduce new archetypes, feats, character traits, racial traits, and archetypes for the core, featured, and uncommon races described in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Advanced Race Guide.

If you&rsquo;re  just tuning in, my name is Johnny Atom-Bomb, your humble host broadcasting live from Old Line Radio, the Tri-State Wasteland&rsquo;s only radio station, excepting derelict government civil defense broadcasts or other dubious transmissions. The wasteland may not look like much, but she&rsquo;s all we got, and I&rsquo;m here to help you see another sunset.  So load your gun, turn up that dial, and stay tuned.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&mdash;Old Line Radio Opening Sign-on Announcement<br/><br/>The rules of TNT could be used for any post-apocalyptic world, but the official setting begins in the heart of the Tri-State Wasteland, a part of the old Mid-Atlantic States of Maryland, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.  <br/>The core rules include, from website &quot;This is Not a Test uses 10-sided dice, referred to as D10 in the rules, and occasionally standard six-sided dice, labeled D6.<br/><br/>Two types of dice roll mechanics resolve all actions: Opposed and Stat tests.<br/><br/>Opposed tests are used for resolving direct actions between figures, mainly close combat. Both players roll a D10 and add the appropriate stat and any applicable modifiers. The highest score wins. Ties always go to the defender.<br/><br/>Stat tests are used when a figure is trying to accomplish an action, usually something unopposed by an enemy model.  Examples include opening a locked door or climbing a ledge. The player rolls a D10, adds the relevant stat and any applicable modifiers, and checks to see if he rolled equal to or higher than the required Target Number (TN).  The TN is specified by the type of action, as are the results of success or failure. Unless otherwise specified, all stat tests have a TN of 10. Specific types of tests are discussed further under stats.<br/><br/>Additionally, several dice conventions are used.<br/><br/>Critical Hit: A natural roll of 10 on the D10 indicates a lucky bonus.  Should a Critical be scored the player may roll a D6 and add the result to their original D10 roll.<br/><br/>Fumble: A natural roll of 1 is always bad, but does not result in any penalties.  However, 1s cause additional problems, such as weapon failure or ammo depletion, which are described later in the relevant sections.<br/><br/>D3 &ndash; Some rules require the roll of a D3.  To get a result roll a D6, where a score of 1 to 2 = 1, 3 to 4 = 2, and 5 to 6 = 3. Rolling a D3 never results in a Critical or Fumble.<br/><br/>Scatter &ndash; Scattering means to determine a random direction, usually to represent a misplaced grenade or errant entity.  To determine this direction simply roll a scatter die, or if that is unavailable, roll D10 and use the direction the top of the die is pointing, or some other agreed upon method.<br/><br/>Rerolling Dice &ndash; Some abilities allow players the opportunity to reroll their dice in the event they are unhappy with the first result.  The second result cannot be rerolled even if it is worse.  You may not reroll a reroll!&quot;<br/><br/>The game will offer random encounters to give the play a different feel.<br/><br/>&quot;In This Is Not a Test your warband&rsquo;s problems don&rsquo;t just start with your opponent, the wasteland itself can be just as danger.  TNT offers rules for both hazards of wastes as well as a bestiary of wasteland denizens.   At the beginning of each battle, players roll to determine if any hazards are present.  There roughly a 50% chance something bad will occur.  The point was to offer something a little different without over burdening the players with too much going on.<br/><br/>&quot;Hazards are natural, and unnatural, phenomena that pervade the wasteland.   Earthquake, ash storms, unexploded ordinance and other dangerous events.

When he opened the first of his Whimsyland theme parks in 1958, his fortune and reputation grew even more.<br/><br/>Unknown to almost everyone, Whimsy was a powerful wizard from the 7th Dimension. He used transspiritism to enter the 3rd Dimension and be born as a human in order to escape the machinations of the Dark Lord Geoff Ratzenbourg, whose perverse evil threatened to turn the 7th Dimension into Ratzenbourg's personal hell. Whimsy used his magic to weave a benign enchantment throughout all his creations, encouraging people's natural inclinations toward kindness and joy.<br/><br/>Disaster struck both Whimsy and the 3rd Dimension in 1966 when Ratzenbourg burst through the dimensional barriers to attack Whimsy at the ribbon cutting for the joyfullest place on Earth, the amazing Whimsy World. In a barrage of soulsearing necromancy, Ratzenbourg ripped all of Whimsy's attractions from across the globe into a specially constructed prison zone in the 7th Dimension. Tens of thousands of people visiting Whimsy attractions found themselves trapped in a twisted realm constructed from theme parks, movie theaters, resorts, playhouses, and shopping malls.<br/><br/>"}, "146435": {"poll": [], "name": "Where's the Wizard?", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1761346_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["New Entertainment Ltd"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1761346.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Electronic", "Fantasy"], "age": "4", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The object of Where's the Wizard? is to collect three Silver Charms by listening and guessing correctly where the young wizard is hiding.<br/><br/>The game consists of a turntable with 10 conical wizard hats along the edge.

Combat is fast, fluid, furious and tactical - your decisions will matter on the battlefield!&quot;<br/><br/>There are five initial factions:<br/><br/>House Teknes<br/><br/>The armies of Teknes are some of the most well rounded troops. They are able to move from a defensive posture to attack in the blink of an eye. Both the Union Workers and Defender Linemen punish their enemies for attacking them. Their specialists and characters often employ lightning and magical wards to bolster their own defensive lines. No army attacks Teknes battle lines without expecting heavy casualties.<br/><br/>House Shael Han<br/><br/>The Shael Han fighting style is a mystery to all of their enemies and for good reason. The Legionaries are some of the weakest troops on the field by themselves, however whenever they are close by a specialist they become a force to reckon with. The Wrath led by their Big Sister are experts in engaging more than one enemy at a time. The true strength of any Shael Han army are their specialists, vulnerable by themselves but extremely powerful when working together they can cause a symphony of destruction on any battlefield.<br/><br/>House Nasier<br/><br/>Nasier love nothing more than to see their enemies wither in their path. The Nasier Ashmen charge is legendary and few enemies have ever lived to tell the tale. They&rsquo;re often supported by the Pelagarth who revel in combat and despite their lack of armor, cause more casualties then they take. The specialists of Nasier prefer to use flames to punish their enemies. One of the most aggressive armies, their zeal for reinstating the Efrenti presence leads them to wrought destruction throughout the continent.<br/><br/>House Hadross<br/><br/>As the most defensive army in the game, Hadross units become stronger both offensively and defensively as the game progresses. With each Deepmen lost, enemy models receive Resonate markers, which makes them easier to kill. Meanwhile the slower yet deadlier Sevridan keep enemy units from fleeing the battlefield. The Hadross specialists enhance the battlefield adding water elements to increase movement.<br/><br/>House Goritsi<br/><br/>Combining the fastest movement in the game with some of the strongest attacks Goritsi prefer hit and run tactics to conventional warfare. Players can employ the blazing speed of the Skorza to flank their enemies while their lethal Zeti hold the line. The terrible Blood Engine consumes the flesh of his enemies to heal his wounds.
