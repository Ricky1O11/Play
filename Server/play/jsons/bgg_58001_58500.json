The two Empires war, not only on the battlefield, but in the marketplaces as well. It is a race for power, resources and wealth.<br/><br/>In the heavens above, twelve deities look down upon Ptalmanar and guide it's people. The most devout worshippers undergo rituals of initiation to take a piece of their god's power into their own souls, opening their bodies to the touch of the divine. The greatest among them can rise to the level of High Priest, assuming the mantle of leadership of the flock and bearing the terrible burden of being the terrestrial voice of their deity. The Maker, creator of all, sits atop the divine wheel with the gods of light cascading down each side. At the bottom, surrounded by his dark children, sits the Unmaker, force of destruction and death. Their eternal struggle is played out wholly in the actions of their earthly followers, ever competing for dominance of the world and the place of Good and Evil.<br/><br/>Our game world bears a richness and depth that few others can match. Highly detailed religion, with three tiers of power within each church that lie beyond just Clerics, Paladins and Druids. The two warring Empires are each carefully detailed so they bear their own identity and atmosphere. The colonial holdings across the ocean and the exploration of the new world are vexed by a fierce militant kingdom of elves seeking to expel the human invaders. Twin Crowns also offers a new system of arcane magic embodied by potent rituals that go far beyond the casting of a simple spell. Guilds of mages guard and covet the secrets of these powerful ensorcellments, and vie for korba, the essential ingredient in their casting.

Unlike Alhambra, the buildings do not have a set value. Instead, building value is determined by the count of that type of building in all players' cities times a multiplier. As in Alhambra, there are 3 scoring rounds during which each building type is examined and points awarded for the player with the majority of that type of building. In the first scoring round, A, only the player with the most tiles of a particular building type scores for that building type (1 times the total count). In the second scoring round, B, the top 2 players score (2 times the total count and 1 times the total count respectively), and in the final round, the top 3 score (3x, 2x, and 1x the total count of that building type). Scoring for a &quot;Beginners Game&quot; is a little different.<br/><br/>There are no ties in Granada: points are never divided like in Alhambra. In the case of two players having the same number of tiles of a particular type in their cities, the player with the highest valued tile of that type wins, and the other player takes next place. So, in Granada, it pays to buy the more expensive buildings.<br/><br/>For example: When the A round-scoring card is turned up, Cindy has 2 Schools, Diana has 2, Tim has 1, Tina and Bailey each have 0, for a total of 5 Schools currently in cities. Cindy's highest School is a 10, Diana's is a 7. So, in round A, Cindy would score 1 x 5 = 5 points.<br/><br/>When the B round-scoring card is turned up, the count for Schools is: Cindy 2, Diana 3, Tim 1, Tina and Bailey 0 each for a total of 6 Schools. So, Diana scores 2 x 6 = 12 points and Cindy scores 1 x 6 = 6 points.<br/><br/>In the final round, the School count is Cindy 2, Diana 3, Tim 1, Tina 2, Bailey 0 for a total of 8 Schools in cities. Cindy's highest School is a 10, Tina's is a 4. So, Diana scores 3 x 8 = 24 points, Cindy score 2 x 8 = 16 points and Tina score 1 x 8 = 8 points.<br/><br/>Another difference in Granada is that the tiles are two-sided: on one side an even-numbered building of some type, on the other a different, odd-numbered building valued exactly one higher. The configuration of the buildings on both sides is identical in terms of moat placement or lack thereof on each side. When purchasing a building, a player can immediately place the building, as is, into her city or may flip it to the other side and place it in her supply for later placement during a remodel action.<br/><br/>The Building Market is initially filled with tiles even-side up. The next time the market is filled, the odd side will be placed up, then even, then odd, etc. A handy toggle feature is provided on the board near the Building Market to facilitate this.<br/><br/>The last difference between Alhambra and Granada, moats instead of walls, is really just a difference in artwork. As in Alhambra, during each scoring round, each player scores points for her longest continuous moat, instead of wall, surrounding her city. The rules are the same regarding tile placement: must be able to trace an unbroken path back to the city's center, moat can touch moat, etc. In games I've played, players have often commented that it seems to be harder to build with the moat tiles of Granada than with the wall tiles of Alhambra. Just one more way to make Granada an advanced version of Alhambra?<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Alhambra<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["German Edition", "Queen First International Edition"], "average": "6.97124", "name": "Granada", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Commodity Speculation", "Set Collection", "Tile Placement"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "394", "boardgameaccessory": ["Alhambra: Two-Sided Game Board"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Alhambra", "Cities: Granada", "Country: Spain"]}, "58102": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Turbo-Kreisel", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1983", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1411017_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Schmidt International", "Schmidt Spiele"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1411017.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["French edition", "German edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This game is very similar to Battling tops.

The score should be adjusted.<br/>Oogie Boogie: Oogie Boogie loves to gamble and is ready to test his luck by mixing up everyone's tiles. After a player plays this special tile all players place their tiles face down and mixes thime up. Players now pick new tiles without looking at them. The original player who first restented the Oogie Boogie tile chooses whehter or not to participate in the reshuffle.<br/>Sally: When Sally needs to escape for the night she often slips deadly nightshade into Dr. Finklestein's soup causing him to sleep long enough for her to sneak away. Use this tile to make your next opponent &quot;sleep&quot;, causing them to have their turn skipped. Play continues with the next player.<br/>Mayor: The Mayor of Halloweentown often flips his head around to express joy or anxiety and this tile can help you &quot;flip&quot; your opponent's rack around. When using this tile, choose any opponent to spin his/her rack around. He/she can spin the rack as fast as he/she likes but should be careful as tiles often fly off in many directions.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "8", "name": "Scrabble: Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas Edition", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Tile Placement", "Variable Player Powers"], "average": "5.66667", "usersrated": "6", "boardgamefamily": ["Holidays: Christmas", "The Nightmare Before Christmas", "Scrabble"]}, "58154": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "All The King\u2019s Men", "rpgdesigner": ["Andrew Schneider"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic597847.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Forgotten Realms"], "rpgproducer": ["Shawn Merwin"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (4th Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Wizards of the Coast"], "average": "0", "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["CORM - Living Forgotten Realms Cormyr Regional Adventures", "Living Forgotten Realms"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic597847_t.jpg", "description": "From the front of the book:<br/><br/>A mysterious coffin washes ashore near Marsember, and everyone wants it!

Rat Ogres can allow you to get more out of your Skaven units, and the terrifying Clan Moulder Elite Rat Ogres are solid walls of muscle that can overwhelm many a foe.<br/><br/>Empires rise and fall, and they require development and support if they are to last. The Scout Camp can provide you new options, and the Anvil of Doom assists the forces of Order by improving the quality of their weapons and armour.

Mob Up lets the Orcs see the fruits of their fighting, without that annoying Order ability to cancel damage getting in the way.

As the name implies, this one's for the kids.<br/><br/>The game follows the same, award-winning design as the other two versions. There's a large, colorful board, a deck of 200 noun cards, a deck of 75 adjective cards, a deck of voting cards (8 sets of cards, each with a unique border color, numbering 1-10) and a collection of 8 colored pawns, one for each of the sets of voting cards. The board has numbered spaces for 10 noun cards, a space for the adjective card, and a scoring track. The noun cards are drawn and placed face-up, one in each of the numbered spaces on the board. An adjective card is turned over. Players select the one noun they think most closely fits the adjective, place their vote face down on the table, and then take turns revealing their selection. The answer receiving the greatest number of votes is deemed the winning answer and the players who chose the winning answer move ahead one space. In a case where there is no clear majority, no one scores. Hence the name, Consensus.<br/><br/>The key to the difference between the Junior Edition and the other editions of Consensus is the content of the noun and adjective cards. Given, for example, the following randomly selected noun cards:<br/><br/>* Bee Hive<br/>    * Bed Bug<br/>    * My Daddy<br/>    * Nemo<br/>    * World Peace<br/><br/>Which would you vote for if the adjective were (also a random sample):<br/><br/>* Rare<br/>    * Adorable<br/>    * Unforgettable<br/><br/>If the adjective were &quot;rare,&quot; which do you think is, um, rarest: your daddy, world peace, Nemo? Which the most adorable? Which the most self-evidently unforgettable?<br/><br/>Even as the mature person you most obviously are, you'd still have a somewhat clear and more or less patently obvious choice, regardless of which adjective was chosen. And, with an &quot;opponent&quot; of the unabashed certainty of an eight-year-old, you know there will be strong opinions about everything. This is what makes the Junior Edition so appealing: everyone counts, everyone in the family finds themselves personally invited, everyone has an opinion, everyone feels equally entitled, equally correct, and, with the Junior edition, pretty much equally informed.

All of the forum posts, and linked items are being moved to the individual game entries, with anything sufficiently generic being linked to the Summoner Wars Master Set. All content will be maintained.<br/><br/>Summoner Wars is a fast-playing, action-packed 2-4 player card game.  Players take on the role of Summoners: powerful beings who harness the power of mysterious Summoning Stones to lead their race to conquest on the war-torn planet of Itharia.  These Summoners wield terrible magic on the battlefield, freezing their foes in place, draining their enemies of power, and even bringing rains of fire down from the heavens.   But most notoriously, they summon their great race&rsquo;s hordes of warriors to the battlefield, to clash in the never-ending struggle for supremacy.  A Summoner is both mage and general, and must combine their wizardly might with clever tactics to defeat the enemy Summoner on the opposite side of the battle.<br/><br/>Each Starter Set of Summoner Wars contains 2 complete, battle-ready Factions, ready to jump you and an opponent into the thick of the War for Itharia.  Each Faction is a unique race or civilization with its own secret goals, be it wild-eyed Elves bent on revenge, or blood-crazed Goblins who merely want to set the world ablaze.  Starter Sets also include everything you will need to play, including a Battle Mat, Wound counters, dice, and a rulebook.<br/><br/>But the war doesn&rsquo;t end there!  Summoner Wars is fully expandable with entirely new faction decks such as the hideous Undead of the Fallen Kingdom, or the righteous and knightly Human Vanguards.  In addition, each Faction will have its own expansions, adding new warriors, summoners, and abilities to allow for a never-ending mix of combat options and surprises.  Expansions will also include Mercenary units - warriors who care nothing for politics and will fight for any side that can afford them!<br/><br/>Summoner Wars uses a simple but deep rules set to capture both the strategy of deck construction and card playing, with the tactics of miniature war games.  By purchasing expansions or multiple Starter Sets, players can customize their Faction Decks to suit any style of play and to keep their opponents guessing.

In order to help their children, their parents start buying houses, vans and cars. However, their children have strong colour preferences, and also like their houses and vehicles to be colour-coordinated.<br/><br/>Each of the three to six players takes the role of one family, and aims to be the first to set up all their children for their adult life. This will involve repainting houses, repainting garages, buying and exchanging vans and cars, until your children are happily installed in their new homes.<br/><br/>Chelsea is a simple, yet thought provoking game, which teaches children to plan a strategy and follow it through in order to succeed. Because it only has a small amount of luck, children are rewarded for good play, and thus encouraged to think about what they are doing. But most importantly, because Chelsea is a game which teaches, rather than a teaching aid disguised as a game, children will enjoy it, and play it again and again.<br/><br/>[Note] The emphasis on children as the target audience for this game does it a serious a dis-service &amp; kills its appeal to a gamer.

One player plays the 4 tigers, the other one the 25 hunters. Tigers are on the board from the beginning and moving one space orthogonally, while hunters are first placed on the board one by one until all hunters are on the board. Then these also move in the same way.<br/>Tigers now can capture hunters by jumping over one hunter and land on a free space behind it or move (not jump!) between two hunters and remove both of them. If a jump opens an occasion for another jump, this is done in the same move, and so on. The tigers are forced to capture as many hunters as possible, and the tigers` player has to tell before his move, how many total hunters he will capture in his move.<br/>The only way hunters can capture tigers is a wrong move by the tigers` player. This is, when the tigers move in a way that they are only capturing less hunters than possible, if made a &quot;perfect&quot; move. The tiger which is doing the &quot;wrong&quot; move, is captured.<br/>Hunters win, if tigers are all captured or immobilized. There are two more special situations, both &quot;stalemates&quot;, but wins for the hunters: 1. If hunters are immobile (Mandua stalemate) or 2. if they are even sacrificed with the effect of immobilizing the remaining hunters. <br/>Tigers win, if all hunters are captured.<br/>This game was invented by two Germans living in Indonesia and is derived from the tactics of ancient Indian tiger-hunting.<br/><br/>"}, "58392": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic616897.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2005", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "0", "boardgamepublisher": ["Broccoli"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic616897_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Collectible Components", "Video Game Theme"], "description": "The Lyc&egrave;e Trading Card Game is a Japanese collectible card game developed by Silver Blitz and published by Broccoli.

Each chapter builds upon the details of the last, teaching the hallmarks of good game mastering.

And resolution should allow for continuance; the promise of greater glory and danger in an ongoing campaign.<br/><br/>Insidiae breaks new ground for game designers, professional or amateur, writers or anyone who has ever wanted to unravel the mysteries good adventure or story writing!<br/><br/>"}, "58419": {"rpgdesigner": ["Gary Gygax"], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)", "Lejendary Adventure"], "poll": [], "name": "Gary Gygax's Living Fantasy", "rpgartist": ["Andy Hopp", "Matt Milberger", "Stephen Lea  Sheppard", "Bryan Swartz", "Jason Walton"], "rpgproducer": ["Mac Golden", "Andy Hopp", "Nita Lewis", "Mark Sandy"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic574042.jpg", "usersrated": "7", "rpgitemversion": ["Hardcover version"], "average": "7", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Troll Lord Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Gygaxian Fantasy Worlds"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic574042_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>From the back of the book:<br/><br/>For the vigilant gamer or the driven world builder, Living Fantasy drives forward the host of information in the Gygaxian Fantasy Worlds series.

In each turn, the players place their pawns on the board, along the banks of the Nile, getting the advantages shown on each square. On the right bank there are fixed squares where the players may get workers, improve their mercantile capabilities, influence the floods (and thus the fertility of the fields) and reserve the right to build the monuments (that are built only after all the placements are done). On the left bank the players may take cards that are deployed randomly on the 10 squares at the start of each turn; some of these cards are kept until the end of the game (cultivable fields, stone quarries, deities granting special advantages), while others are discarded after the use and offer multiple immediate advantages.<br/><br/>In Egizia, the twist on the worker placement mechanic is that the players must place their pawns following the course of the Nile, moving northwards (from the top to the bottom of the board, that is seen from the Mediterranean Sea). In this way, each placement not only blocks the opponents from choosing the same square (except monuments, where multiple players are always allowed), but also forces the player to place his remaining pawns only on the squares below the one he just occupied (note that &quot;pawns&quot; are placed, since &quot;workers&quot; are one of the resources of the game, like grain and stones).<br/><br/>When the placement phase is over, the workers of the players must be fed with the grain produced in the fields. The production of each field is based on the floods of the Nile, so some fields may not give grain each turn. If a player has not enough grain for all his workers, he has to buy it with Victory Points (the ratio is better for players with improved mercantile capabilities, recorded on a specific track on the board).<br/><br/>After that, stones are received from the owned quarries and used to build the monuments (if the right to do was reserved earlier) along with the workers.<br/><br/>When the game ends, the points scored during the game (mainly building the monuments) are added to the bonuses obtained fulfilling certain conditions on the Sphinx cards.

When on television, they can be seen in the Prisoner, Columbo, nearly every episode of Law and Order, and just about any other crime drama. In these and other media, the forms of interrogation are familiar, such as the classic scene (of late-night, hard-boiled fame) including a table, a chair, an overhead light bulb, and cigarettes.<br/><br/>InTERRORgation contains rules and ideas for role playing sessions designed to unnerve players as they play the roles of suspects. The players use interrogation scenes and flashbacks to determine the past as they struggle through the present.<br/><br/>InTERRORgation is a &quot;shot,&quot; a small game with the rules you need to play and all the nonsense stripped away.<br/><br/>InTERRORgation comes in an unique format.

It is up to the players and Games Master to find their own version of the West, finding their own trail between truth and legend. If the players want a historically accurate game where miles are miles, events occur as they truly did, and death comes more often from disease than a bullet, then they will find the tools they need in this book.

They may be soldiers who fight at the famous battles of the West, or adventurers who blaze the trails through the wilderness. They can be statesmen or scoundrels, outlaws or lawmen, the quick or the dead. They will either become part of the legend, or die in some godforsaken hot and dusty place and be forgotten.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "58494": {"rpgdesigner": ["Christopher Blackmoor", "Richard Farrese", "Richard Ford", "Daniel Robichaud", "Erik K.
