The combination of proximity to British units and alert level may trigger an activation marker that may hide 0 to 4 German units. These activated units may then fight and move. German move is dictated by closest (in PM) and largest enemy stack or German stack. Combat - Fire and/or Assault -  is resolved by comparing the strength of both adjacent stacks modified by the presence of an officer, the terrain modifier and 1D6 for the British and 1D10 for the Germans. Largest score inflicts one step loss to the other.

Conan towered above them, and no two of them could match his strength. They were hardy and robust, but his was the endurance and vitality of a wolf, his thews steeled and his nerves whetted by the hardness of his life in the world's wastelands. He was quick to laugh, quick and terrible in his wrath. He was a valiant trencherman, and strong drink was a passion and a weakness with him. Naive as a child in many ways, unfamiliar with the sophistry of civilization, he was naturally intelligent, jealous of his rights, and dangerous as a hungry tiger. Young in years, he was hardened in warfare and wandering, and his sojourns in many lands were evident in his apparel.&quot;<br/><br/>&mdash; Robert E. Howard, Queen of the Black Coast<br/><br/>This expansion lets you bring alternate versions of Conan the Barbarian and B&ecirc;lit, Queen of the Black Coast, as envisioned by the legendary Brom, to your tabletop!<br/><br/>The heroes come with a unique set of skills and equipment that adds more customisation and replay-ability to your games of Conan.<br/><br/>This version of Conan is based on the Cimmerian's days as a thief and as such he appears slightly less powerful in combat. But he does come with more toolbox abilities fitting this new role.<br/><br/>The version of B&ecirc;lit in the core box is that of a charismatic leader, preferring to take a backfield roll.

The goal of the game is to collect the most tokens of any color by the end of the game. Playing pieces in the Berd game have ability to attach/detach to each other. That allows players to move a stack of tokens like a single unit and split the structure when needed. Using interlocking blocks players can create towers and a certain type of tower - Berd has unique properties that make this game special.<br/><br/>The design of the game is specially made simple underlying an easy and logical concept of the game. However the Berd is a serious game and players have to think strategically to win. Also, the board without a theme allows to play many different Berd games.<br/><br/>The board of the Berd game has a shape of a square castle from top view. In fact the starting/finishing corner squares were designed larger for accommodating four stacks of tokens.<br/><br/>Berd game can be played by two and more players. The game set includes two different games and over six game variations for each game.<br/><br/>Berd game can be setup in few seconds. Duration of any option of the Berd game depends on how many tokens are played. So players can set up a rapid game of 10 minutes or a long game of 90 minutes. The Berd game for two players may last less than 5 minutes.<br/><br/>Berd game can be adjusted for luck and strategy. By employing more tokens in the game it becomes heavier in strategy.<br/><br/>Berd game perfectly fits for tournaments because players can accumulate tokens (or points) in series of games with different players.<br/><br/>The interlocking blocks in the &ldquo;Berd&rdquo; game are made of high quality ABS plastic with thick walls, so they can last forever without wearing and breaking.<br/><br/>The Berd game is ideal for educating children, especially when using value assigned tokens. The game can also help developing strategic thinking.<br/><br/>Berd game is pending for the US patent and registered for PCT.<br/><br/>Berd is a registered trademark.<br/><br/>Game setting<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game players choose color of tokens they will play. All players will get equal number of tokens. Then players throw one die for determining who will select the starting/finishing corner the first. The highest scored player will select his/her starting corner the first. Other players will follow in descending order placing stack of their tokens on any starting corner they want. Players can start from the same corner. The highest scored player will start the game following by other players in clockwise direction.<br/><br/>Some definitions:<br/><br/>1. Tower &ndash; a stack of 2 or more tokens (any color). The color of the token on top represents who owns that tower.<br/>2. Berd &ndash; two or more tokens of the same color stacked on each other on the top of a tower. A Berd is considered a protected tower.<br/>3. UT &ndash; Unprotected Token/Tower =&gt; a single token or a tower which is not a Berd. An unprotected tower moves like a single token.<br/>4. Double &ndash; when you roll the same number on each die. In this case, you are to play the number 4 times.<br/>5. Active Token &ndash; a token is still on the board that hasn&rsquo;t been captured.  <br/>6. Inactive token &mdash; a token captured in a tower or Berd by other color token. Inactive tokens always stacked under the active tokens.<br/>7. Active Player &ndash; a player who still has active token(s).<br/>8. Recovering inactive token - a player can recover his/her inactive token(s), captured in an unprotected tower, by landing on that tower. In this case the player will create a Berd by re-stacking his/her tokens on the top.<br/><br/>Process of the game<br/><br/>Players roll a pair of dice and move UTs (unprotected tokens/towers) on the board by counting squares in the clockwise direction. You can play with one UT both scores of the dice, or play each value of the die by different UT. You must move an unprotected tower like a single unit with captured tokens attached underneath of your token. Players will capture opponent&rsquo;s UT when land on them. However, you can&rsquo;t capture a Berd and you can&rsquo;t land on a square occupied by the Berd. If you capture an unprotected tower that contains your color token(s) inside, then you will restack the whole tower and put your color tokens on the top, creating a Berd. There is no limit of capturing other tokens. However, if you create a Berd, you cannot move it whole. You have to split up your Berd and play token(s) or unprotected tower(s) from your Berd separately. If your Berd contains captured tokens, they must be attached to at least one of your tokens whether moving or staying. You can split captured tokens in any combination when splitting your Berd but they must be attached under your token(s). When you roll a double, you will play the scored points four times. That is a great advantage especially with Berd because you can move two or more tokens simultaneously, so they will remain protected. When a player finishes his/her token by reaching the starting corner, this player will collect one token from each active player. In order to finish, you don&rsquo;t have to land exactly on the corner square that you started from; you can go over. Other players should decide what color and from where to give a token to the finished player. They can give any token in their possession, whether from the board or from already finished tokens. When finishing, you only get tokens based on how many of your own color tokens finished. <br/>The game is over when only one active player remains. The winner is the player who collected the most tokens of any color. Tokens left on the board are not counted. You can just stack all your collected tokens and compare to see whose tower is taller.<br/><br/>Variations of the game<br/><br/>This game set has many game options:<br/><br/>1. Short path simple game &ndash; this is a basic Berd game played on the side of the folding board with a shorter path. This game lasts about 25 minutes (4 players x 9 tokens). The duration of the game can be shortened with fewer players and/or using fewer tokens<br/><br/>2. Long path simple game &ndash; this is a basic Berd game played on the side of folding board with a longer path. This game lasts about 40 minutes (4 players x 9 tokens)<br/><br/>3. Game with color protection &ndash; both 1 and 2 games can be played with color protection. Players can use colored squares on the board for protection from being captured by the opponents token. For example: Blue color player&rsquo;s single token or unprotected tower will be protected on the Blue square. Other players can&rsquo;t capture the Blue token on the blue square and they can&rsquo;t land on the blue square if it&rsquo;s occupied by the Blue token. The rest of the game rules are same as for the basic Berd game<br/><br/>4. Game with points &ndash; 1, 2, and 3 games can be played with points. Each color tokens have different weights/points (10; 20; 30; 40; 50; 60; 70; 80 and 90), shown on the tokens. This option of the game provides more possibilities for moves. The winner will be a player who collects highest total score. In order to play this version of the game you need to attach stickers with numbers. There are lines on the sides of the token for even attachment.<br/><br/>5. Game with hidden numbers &ndash; 1, 2, and 3 games can be played with tokens that have hidden numbers (numbers are not displayed outside, they are attached inside). This game is similar to game #4 with the difference that only the player who possesses a token can see the weight of that token. This feature introduces more intrigue and uncertainty about end result of the game. Also this version of game allows players to bet.<br/><br/>6. Berd game without dice &ndash; this game is quite different from the race game on the path. It is a two player game and played on a small two sided square board. One side has 3&times;3 squares and other side has 4&times;4 squares. The goal of the game is to collect more tokens than your opponent. At the beginning of the game players setup their tokens on base lines (the first line from each side) opposing each other. Players collect token(s) crossing the board starting from their base line and finishing - passing opponent&rsquo;s baseline.  Players move their UT (unprotected token or Unprotected tower) one square at a time forward or lateral move. You can&rsquo;t move your UT diagonally or backward. While you can move your UT laterally however you can&rsquo;t do more than three consecutive side moves. After the third consecutive side movement a player must do next move forward. After the forward move you can do side movement again. You can&rsquo;t land on a square occupied by your opponent&rsquo;s Berd. A player can recover his/her captured token(s) from opponent&rsquo;s unprotected tower by landing on that tower. In this case the player will re-stack tokens and place his/her tokens on the top creating a Berd. In order to play a token from the Berd you have to split the Berd and play a single token or unprotected tower. If there are captured tokens in the Berd they must be attached at least under one of your token. The game is over when only one player has active token(s) left on the board.  Now players can stack their collected tokens and see whose tower is taller or who collected more tokens.<br/><br/>7. Berd game without dice with color protection -this game is similar to game #3 in terms of the color protection<br/><br/>8. Berd game without dice and with points &ndash; this game is similar to game #4 in terms of number consideration<br/><br/>9. Berd game without dice with hidden numbers &ndash; this game is similar to game #5 in terms of number consideration.<br/><br/>10. Berd Team game &ndash; this game option can be played by two or more teams. Each player will play with his/her color tokens. The goal of the team to collect the most tokens (or points). Players of the same team can land on the squares occupied by teammate and stack the tokens in one tower. If there was a Berd on that square it will protect all tokens of the team. Team also can share the captured tokens. That is a great advantage for the team, since they can decide when and how many captured tokens to move. When finishing a token only rival team members will pay token(s). The game is over when only one team has active player(s).<br/><br/>11. Game with trading options: In this game players can trade captured token(s) with other players. All players will start the game with same count of tokens and some cash. The goal of the game is to accumulate the most capital (cash + value of collected tokens). Each token at the end of the game will worth certain amount of money predetermined at the beginning of the game. During the game players can redeem captured token(s) by paying cash or swapping with other token(s). The market value of the captured token will vary depending on the location on the board and a possibility to recover it. Because the captured token will have a fixed value when finished a player, who captured the token can negotiate higher price. On the other hand a player who wants to redeem his token may want to pay higher price because active tokens can potentially capture other tokens. Players can negotiate a trade only at their turn. After redemption a token must be started from the starting corner. When a player finishes a token, all other active players have to pay one token or pay cash for the finished token. Depending on the board situation each player will decide what method of payment is a better. The winner of the game will be a player who accumulates more capital =&gt; (Number of collected tokens) x Price + Cash.<br/><br/>12. Game with points and trading options: This game is similar to the Berd game#11 with one difference =&gt; when a player finishes a token other players will pay by token or pay the price indicated on the finished token. At the end of the game players calculate the total value of collected tokens + cash. The value of a token is a number/price on the sticker. The winner is a player who collected the most capital.<br/><br/>13. Game with a goal to collect certain numbers &ndash; in this game a player tries to collect some certain tokens with same number on sticker (for example tokens with number 20). If there are 4 players in the game then maximum quantity of any number will be 4. The first player who collects all 4 numbers will win the game. If the game finished earlier then the winner is a player who collected the most of the specified number tokens. In this game players follow same Berd playing concept but for the finished token other players don&rsquo;t pay tokens. Also players are not required to finish their tokens when passing their start/finish corner, - they can continue playing these tokens.<br/>       <br/>All the above game variations can be played with different quantity of tokens. The more tokens employed in the game the heavier it will be in strategy.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "English first edition", "English second edition"], "name": "Berd", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Area Enclosure", "Area-Impulse", "Player Elimination", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "average": "8.44444", "usersrated": "9", "age": "12"}, "214577": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "rpgseries": ["Living Greyhawk", "RTK - Living Greyhawk Ratik Regional Adventure", "RTK1 - Ratik Season One"], "name": "Best Defense", "rpgdesigner": ["Thomas Miller (II)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3276306.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Greyhawk"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (3rd Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Wizards of the Coast"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3276306_t.jpg", "description": "A One-Round Living Greyhawk Ratik Adventure<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/><br/>The walls of Ratikhill are threatened.

(To play all permutations of player numbers and board sizes would require approximately 85 pieces in one color, 85 pieces in a second color, 55 pieces in a third color, and 45 pieces in a fourth color.)<br/><br/>Basic idea:      In Archipelago, players try to create more islands (i.e. groups of two or more adjacent pieces) than opponents create.<br/><br/><br/>RULES<br/><br/>A group (&quot;island&quot;) is a connected set of two or more same-colored stones. Each player is the owner of a single color of stone.  An island in a given color will count toward its color-owner's score, regardless of whether the color-owner or an opponent created that island.<br/><br/>Players are allowed three stone placements per turn. (Exception: the first player in a two player game plays just two stones on his/her very first turn. See the section SPECIAL RULES BY PLAYER NUMBER below.) These three stones can be ANY color (i.e. on your turn, you needn't play any of your own color of stones if you don't wish to; you can play any color or any mix of colors in a single turn). A stone can be played to any empty cell; once placed, stones do not move.<br/><br/>Additionally, a player is permitted to play a bonus stone (of any color of his/her choice) for every opponent who is strictly ahead of him/her in the current group score; each player's &quot;group score&quot; = the number of distinct groups in his/her color.  (Note that when using a score track, the number of bonus stones you are allowed is always equal to the number of opponent stones strictly ahead of you on the track at the start of your turn.)<br/><br/>Bonus stone examples: In a two player game, the trailing player gets one bonus stone and thus plays 4 stones to the board (the default three stones + the bonus stone). In a three player game with each player having a distinct number of groups, the second-place player plays 4 stones and the last-place player plays 5 stones. In a three player game with two players tied for first-place, the last-place player plays 5 stones. In a three player game with two players tied for last-place, each last-place player plays 4 stones.<br/><br/>When the board is full, or when all players have consecutively passed their turns, the game ends. The winning order is determined by the greatest number of groups. In the case of a tie, the tied player who was most recently in the lead is the winner. (This status can be very easily tracked on a score board &ndash; see the score boards available in the instruction set that is downloadable in the file section of this page.)<br/><br/>Tie break examples: <br/>&bull;    Players A and B are tied at the game's end with four groups each.  Player A never had more than four groups, but at one point earlier in the game Player B had five groups, which A subsequently reduced back to four groups via sabotage, i.e. by playing a stone in B's color to join two of B's formerly distinct groups. Player B wins on the tie break, since B was most recently ahead of A. <br/>&bull;    Players A and B are tied at the game's end with five groups each, whereas C has six groups.  C is thus the winner, with A and B tied for second place.  Earlier in the game both A and B had six groups. B went down from six groups to five before A did, meaning that A wins second place.<br/><br/><br/>SPECIAL RULES BY PLAYER NUMBER<br/><br/>TWO PLAYERS:<br/><br/>To neutralize the first player advantage, the first player plays only two stones on his her turn. Thereafter players play three on stones on each of their turns (plus any bonus stones they are entitled to).<br/><br/>THREE PLAYERS<br/><br/>Each player, even the first player, plays three stones per turn (plus any bonus stones). There is no need to neutralize the first player advantage since the remaining players can be counted on to act together in a temporary alliance to neutralize any such advantage.<br/><br/>However, the following &quot;Frozen Irrelevance&quot; rule is recommended:<br/><br/>o    Frozen Irrelevance: When the board arrangement is such that a player's current rank (e.g. 1st, 2nd, or 3rd) is unalterable by any further play from any player, then that player's rank has assumed its final form, and he/she is &quot;frozen&quot; from further play. That is, he/she takes no further part in the game, and the game play continues on with just the non-frozen players.<br/><br/>FOUR PLAYERS<br/><br/>With four players, each player (including the first player) plays only TWO stones per turn (plus bonus stones). Also, &quot;Frozen Irrelevance&quot; is recommended. Finally, use just a 0.5 bonus stone for each player you strictly trail (rounding up).<br/><br/><br/>VARIATIONS<br/><br/>&bull;    Bonus stones: Consider awarding no bonus stones at all. Alternatively (in a 3 player game), consider awarding just a 0.5 stone bonus for each opponent whom you strictly trail (rounding up).<br/><br/>&bull;    Default number of stones: The 2-3 player game may be adjusted by lowering the default number of stones per turn from 3 stones to 2 stones per turn.  The 4 player game can be tried with 3 stones per turn.<br/><br/>&bull;    Opening protocol: In a 2 player game, use a different opening protocol, namely, the first player on his/her first turn places just one stone, the second player on his/her first turn places two stones, and thereafter the default for each player is three stones (plus any bonus stones).

The Pomarj, a humanoid nation, has carved out a large country for themselves at the expense of our own lands. During the Great War with Iuz the Old to the north, we supplied those great nations opposing him with our best troops. During that time, Turrosh Mak and his humanoid scum struck at us from the east and forced us to retreat back to the Lortmil hills. Having lost all of the lands from the Lortmil hills to the Jewel River to this plague of humanoids has caused our nation to focus on rebuilding our strength. We have fortified our position in the hills to stanch the flow of humanoids into our country. Join us in the fight to retake our disputed lands and to destroy the plague of humanoids that have infested the eastern half of our country.<br/><br/>"}, "214676": {"rpgdesigner": ["Matt Capstraw"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "rpgseries": ["Living Greyhawk", "ULP - Living Greyhawk Ulek Regional Adventures", "ULP1 - Ulek Season One"], "name": "Find My Son!", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["Jan Capstraw"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3277689.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Greyhawk"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (3rd Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Wizards of the Coast"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3277689_t.jpg", "description": "A One-Round Living Greyhawk Scenario<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/><br/>A quiet day of shopping is interrupted by the please of a father looking for his missing son.<br/><br/>An adventure for characters levels 1 - 6.<br/><br/>"}, "214677": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "rpgseries": ["Living Greyhawk", "ULP - Living Greyhawk Ulek Regional Adventures", "ULP1 - Ulek Season One"], "name": "Spies Like Us", "rpgdesigner": ["Christopher Reed"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3277679.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Greyhawk"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (3rd Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Wizards of the Coast"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3277679_t.jpg", "description": "A One-Round Living Greyhawk Scenario<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/><br/>You are asked to help locate three halfling scouts who have gone missing.

A place for peasants to relax, travellers to rest and heroes to plan their next daring adventure. But what of the unsung heroes of it all - the tavern keepers?<br/><br/>In Tavern Keeper you manage a tavern, building, bartering, cooking and cleaning your way to success in a humorous fantasy world.

Series, where  the Russian Front of World War II was first simulated,  then taking the action to the African Front, the Italian Front , the French &amp; Polish Fronts, game designer Carl Paradis now presents the fifth chapter: No Retreat 5: The Western Front 1944-45.<br/><br/>After the Fall of France in May of 1940, the Battle of Britain put a stop to Hitler&rsquo;s ambitions in the West. While his attentions turned eastwards towards the vast expanses of the Soviet Union, the German Army, occupying most of Western Europe, started fortifying the coastlines to defend the Nazi dictator&rsquo;s conquests against the resurgent Allied might: the vaunted &ldquo;Atlantic Wall&rdquo; was born. Soon, Allied troops will be knocking upon its doorstep&hellip;<br/><br/>In No Retreat 5, players command the Allied or German forces, invading or defending West Europe: France, Belgium, Holland and Germany proper. Maneuvering forces over hexes that are approximately 20 kilometers across, over turns that each represent between a week to a month of real time. The No Retreat series card-assisted game system is there to create on-map puzzles around each hex, unit and battle as the tense engagements rage back-and-forth and nothing is entirely predictable, and also manages the pre-invasion &ldquo;fog-of-war&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The game is split up in two different parts.<br/><br/>The Invasion Game:  Starting in 1943.  It will consist of the preparations preceding the Allied Invasion of Western Europe, with deception, intelligence and build-up efforts being showcased. The D-Day outcome is then gamed using intense weekly turns.<br/><br/>The Front Game: After the Allies are ashore, their beachhead secure (unless they are pushed back in the English Channel!), the rest of the game consists of monthly turns simulating the War in the West, up to the bitter end and probable surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945; the longer the game lasts, the stronger the Soviets position will be in Central Europe, or perhaps Hitler will be able to stave off total defeat long enough for an armistice and negotiated outcome?<br/><br/>The D-Day sea invasion will be shown in great detail, the German fortified positions also, with both players having to choose where to deploy their assets, where to attack, and what kind of troops to use and request from higher command. As the German commander, will you ask the OKW for more Panzers, or more bunkers and guns; will you gain full control of your mobile troops, or will you have limited control, as historically happened? As the Allied commander, will troops fighting in Italy be released to you for an end-run South of France invasion? Or perhaps you will decide to invade the Low Countries instead, trying to capture the important port of Antwerp in a surprise operation?<br/><br/>A simple but effective supply system will show the constraints the victorious Allied Armies suffered for a good part of the campaign after breaking out of their invasion beachhead. Special Event cards will simulate effortlessly the events happening on the Eastern Front, the effects of the strategic bomber offensive, the political pressures put on both players&rsquo; operations by their respective leaders, etc. Will Hitler let you use the Panzer reserves in time? Will Churchill make a bit for a more upfront role for the British units? Will Heavy Bombers be released for more tactical uses? All this and more will be shown and simulated. Embark in your Landing craft, keep watch in your concrete Bunker, the Invasion is coming, and there will be No Retreat!<br/><br/>Western Front Scenario Listing<br/>Regular Campaign Game: The Invasion Game, followed by the Front Game. Players will thus have a lot of leeway in their initial Strategic Choices. What if the Allies had invaded in le-pas-De-Calais instead of Normandy? What if the German Panzers were moved closer to the beaches?<br/>Historical Campaign Game:  The Game starts with the Invasion game already pre-set, and the Normandy landings. Historical OOBs only.<br/>Invasion Game Scenario: Only the first part of the game is played up to the resolution of the D-Day Invasion. Depending on its level of success, the outcome of the rest of the campaign, and victory is then determined using a set of special tables.<br/>Front Game Scenario: Only the second part of the game is played, starting with the Normandy Breakout.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>One 22x34 Mapboard (mounted and two-sided) <br/>Two sheets of 88, 2-sided square units (176 Total) <br/>One sheet of 112, 2-sided round/hex markers.<br/>One rule book (40 pages)<br/>One Scenario Book (24 pages)<br/>Six Play-aid cards<br/>Two decks of 55 Event Cards <br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Scale: Each unit is one Division or Corps: Each hex is about 20 kilometers from side to side for the main campaign map, smaller for the Invasion map.

Suetonius Paulinus stands ready to deal his final blow against a vicious insurgency in Rome&rsquo;s new province. Inspired by Rome&rsquo;s implacable opponents, the Druids, the remaining fanatical warriors of a two-year insurgency hold out on the island of Anglesey. Having made an amphibious landing on the island&rsquo;s shores, Paulinus and his legionaries must cut their way through fierce opposition on the beach.<br/><br/>While his cohorts ravage the island, a messenger reaches Paulinus with news of a tribe that is rampaging the eastern fringes of his province. The Iceni, led by Queen Boudicca, are reported to have murdered local Roman officials and their guards. Other reports soon arrive that the Iceni&rsquo;s revolt is gathering both force and momentum as local tribes are responding to Boudicca&rsquo;s call for open revolt. A large warrior force is said to be devastating Roman villas and farmsteads as it heads south towards the first Roman colony in Britannia, Camulodunum.<br/><br/>Paulinus realizes that with all four of his legions posted in the north and west, this new menace has the potential to ravage Roman colonies and cut his lines of communication. He faces the very real prospect of being Governor of Britannia in name only.<br/><br/>Battles of the Warrior Queen covers the major engagements during the rebellion of the Iceni tribe and Boudicca&rsquo;s allies against the legions of Emperor Nero. Led by Queen Boudicca, the rebellion would be the greatest British threat to nearly four centuries of Roman domination of Britain.<br/><br/>Battle of Mona Insulis<br/><br/>Separated from mainland Britain by the treacherous waters of the Menai Straits, Paulinus faced the challenge of making an opposed beach landing on the Welsh island of Mona Insulis (today&rsquo;s Anglesey). The Britons, arrayed along the shore in a dense and heavily armed line of battle, awaited the assault. Helping whip them into a battle frenzy were the Druid priests, for whom the island was their last sanctuary.<br/><br/>Battle of Camulodunum<br/><br/>On learning that the Iceni tribe had risen in revolt and were heading towards the Roman colony of Camulodunum (modern-day Colchester), the IXth Legion (named as &ldquo;Hispana&rdquo;) set off from its base in Lindum (modern-day Lincoln), under the command of legate Petillius Cerialis. Cerialis was a mercurial individual who had escaped the brink of military disaster before. His luck would be tried once again in his encounter with the Britons.<br/><br/>Battle of Bannaventa<br/><br/>After arriving on the mainland, Paulinus rode east and south in great haste. Outside Londinium news of the defeat of Cerialis and his IXth Legion reached him. Ordering evacuation of the city, Paulinus withdrew hurriedly northwards to the midlands and urgently concentrated the XIVth Gemina and the XXth Legions.<br/><br/>As Boudicca&rsquo;s horde approached, Paulinus drew up his troops in close order in a defile, protected on his flanks and in his rear by dense forest. He new that the Queen of the Iceni would struggle to keep her disparate coalition in check for long, and would soon be compelled to attack.

Walk, shuttle or taxi to places like the bison paddock, Stow Lake, Shakespeare Garden, or the California Academy of Sciences.

It comes with just two pawns, one for recording downs, the other the number of plays. The field has four groups of lines stretching from one end of the field to the other to mark the downs (single, double, triple and quadruple lines), and the ball marker is moved from one to the next to mark downs as well as back and forth to show line of scrimmage. The second peg marks off plays at the end of the board, with a quarter ending after 25 plays and the game after 100.

Over the next 60 years Chicago experienced an economic golden age, making such great progress that it hosted The World's Columbian Exposition in 1893, followed not long after by a celebration of its Century of Progress at The World's Fair in 1931.<br/><br/>Many of the household brands we've come to know and love today had their start in Chicago during this time period; Oscar Mayer, Kraft, Quaker Oats, Nabisco, Swift &amp; Co, Armour &amp; Co, Schwinn Bicycles, Charles Schwab, and many others made a home here in this tall, bold slugger.<br/><br/>In City of the Big Shoulders players take on the roles of entrepreneurs and investors seeking to rebuild Chicago into a city fit for the world stage. In this unique merger of 18xx-style stock manipulation mechanics with euro-style gameplay, players start companies, trade in shares, hire employees, equip their factories, produce goods and sell them to be delivered to homes across the midwest.<br/><br/>Although City of the Big Shoulders features a large amount of strategic depth and rewarding gameplay, it does so in a shorter timeline than is typical of most heavy economic games. Players play just five rounds (also known as decades) in about two and a half hours. Each decade consists of five unique phases: A stock phase where players can buy and sell stock; a building phase where players rebuild the city of Chicago, placing action spaces on the board; an action phase where companies send their partners to make deals across Chicago; an Operating Phase where companies buy resources, produce goods, and ship them out of Chicago; and finally a cleanup phase where the board is set up for the following decade. At the end of the fifth decade, the game ends. Players then exchange shares that they have purchased over the course of the game for cash, are rewarded for any of the public goals they have accomplished over the five decades of play, and tally their money to determine who is Chicago's greatest resident.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "13", "name": "City of the Big Shoulders", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Commodity Speculation", "Stock Holding", "Variable Player Powers", "Worker Placement"], "average": "10", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "214881": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3374342.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Hope S.

And a solo play based on goals.<br/><br/>In the 1970s, the governments of the world faced unprecedented demand for energy, and polluting power plants were built everywhere in order to meet that demand. Year after year, the pollution they generate increases, and nobody has done anything to reduce it. Now, the impact of this pollution has become too great, and humanity is starting to realize that we must meet our energy demands through clean sources of energy. Companies with expertise in clean, sustainable energy are called in to propose projects that will provide the required energy without polluting the environment. Regional governments are eager to fund these projects and to invest in their implementation.<br/><br/>If the pollution isn't stopped, it's game over for all of us.<br/><br/>In the game CO\u2082, each player is the CEO of an energy company responding to government requests for new, green power plants. The goal is to stop the increase of pollution while meeting the rising demand for sustainable energy &mdash; and of course profiting from doing so. You will need enough expertise, money, and resources to build these clean power plants. Energy summits will promote global awareness, and allow companies to share a little of their expertise while learning still more from others.<br/><br/>In CO\u2082, each region starts with a certain number of Carbon Emissions Permits (CEPs) at its disposal. These CEPs are granted by the United Nations, and they must be spent whenever the region needs to install the energy infrastructure for a project or to construct a fossil fuel power plant. CEPs can be bought and sold on a market, and their price fluctuates throughout the game. You will want to try to maintain control over the CEPs.<br/><br/>Money, CEPs, Green Power Plants that you've built, UN Goals you've completed, Company Goals you've met, and Expertise you've gained all give you Victory Points (VPs), which represent your Company's reputation &mdash; and having the best reputation is the goal of the game &hellip; in addition to saving the planet, of course.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual edition"], "average": "8.21429", "name": "CO\u2082 (second edition)", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Card Drafting", "Tile Placement", "Worker Placement"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "7", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Giochistarter", "Global warming", "Solitaire Games"]}, "214888": {"rpgartist": ["Rick Hershey", "Tommi Salama"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Level 1: The Overgrown", "rpgdesigner": ["Jeff Lee", "Michael McCarthy", "Louis Porter, Jr.", "Rich Redman"], "rpgproducer": ["Louis Porter, Jr. Design Studio", "Joshua Yearsley"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3280866.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Louis Porter Jr. Design, Inc."], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Infinite Dungeon"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3280866_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Built atop the foundations of a long-ago ruined city, the most recent group to claim the Halls as their own were the Circle of Ages: a group of druids who venerated the power of the Eternal Moment as a natural force.

After burying his allies, the last of their number sacrificed himself in a great ritual, calling nature itself to continue to protect the Halls in their stead.<br/><br/>The spirits of nature answered his call, animating the trees of the forest by taking the form of Leaf Leshies. These Leshies took to their task enthusiastically, filling the complex with a riot of plant life and doing what they could to keep everything else away.

You prefer nothing more than influencing the living tribes of the island to share their gifts with you. Unfortunately, you aren't the only one. Another divinity shares your passion for these fruits, which leaves you only one choice &mdash; you need to show him your power in order to get more fruits than he does before the end of the fruit season.<br/><br/>To set up, shuffle the nine village tiles and place them in a 3x3 square with some space between each tile. Players then take turns until the fruit supply exhausted or one of them collects four fruits. On a turn, a player creates a new totem (by placing one of their totem tokens on an empty village tile) or moves a totem that has one of their tokens on top. When you move a totem, you must move the entire totem orthogonally as many spaces as the number of tokens in it. As you move, you drop the bottommost token in each village through which you pass, placing the dropped tokens on top of any totem already located there.<br/><br/>When a totem has three tokens stacked in it, the village it's in is influenced, with the player who owns the top token winning a number of fruits equal to the number on the village tile. After this, remove the tokens in this totem and return them to their owners. If a village has a 0 on it, then the tokens are returned with no one collecting fruit; if a village has -1, then the owner of the top totem removes one of their collected fruits from the game.<br/><br/>As soon as a player has four fruit, they win. If the fruit supply is empty, the game ends and whoever has the most fruit wins; in the event of a tie, continue to play until one player would win (or lose) a fruit to determine the winner.<br/><br/>Once you've played a few times, start using the Shaman rule. The second player places a Shaman between two villages before their first move, and no totem can be moved between these two villages.

The local CO-OP market is drowning in debt and the giant corporation MondoMart is threatening to take it over! The city has given the CO-OP just a few weeks to clean up its act. The CO-OP needs to raise money to pay back taxes and legal fees, or the city will sell the CO-OP and its assets to MondoMart to pay off the debts.<br/><br/>How can the CO-OP survive?<br/><br/>The CO-OP owners, all HIPPIES, have invited some like-minded business types to help them save the store. These folks, the so-called BIZZIES (BUSIness people: pronounced like biz-zees), will have to work together with the HIPPIES to save the CO-OP. Together, they will run it as a business (and keep it groovy), but they need to try a bunch of crazy things! However, the city's deadline is quicky approaching, so the group will have to try some pretty unorthodox methods to keep the CO-OP both profitable and groovy! They may even have to open the CO-OP to non-members!&quot;<br/><br/><br/><br/>CO-OP: the co-op game is a cooperative, variable player powers, hand management, marketplace card game for 1-5 players ages 12 and up (although kids ages 10 and up can play with their parent's help).<br/><br/>In CO-OP, all players assume the role of someone who works at the CO-OP (each with special powers).  Each player also has a VIBE track, representing how they are feeling today.  A global Money track represents how much money the CO-OP currently has.  To win, the CO-OP needs at least $10, and each player must be Groovy or Awesome on their individual VIBE chart.<br/><br/>Since the CO-OP is a store, the usual way to make money is to sell goods to Customers.  There is a Storefront where the CO-OP stocks goods to sell to Customers.  When the Storefront runs out of goods, the CO-OP can move goods from the Warehouse to the Storefront a variety of ways.   When the Warehouse runs out of goods, the CO-OP has to spend some money with Distributors to get more goods.  CO-OP is all about balancing when to buy, move, and sell goods.  But also staying groovy!<br/><br/>The game is broken up into days.  Each day, three things occur: A Happening, Players Turn, Clean-up.   A Happening at the start of the day sets-up today's challenge.  Then, each player gets a turn, usually playing a card.  These cards can be Customers (who buy goods from the CO-OP Storefront), Distributors (from whom we buy goods for the Warehouse), Instagroove cards (with instantaneous effect), or Continuous Groove cards (with lasting effects).  After each player plays, then we clean-up (doing end of turn maintenance).  And then start to the next day!<br/><br/>The game is over when the Happening card GAME OVER comes out.  At that time, the players either win or lose (if they have enough money and VIBE).<br/><br/>Players usually play cards on their turn, but they can also Meditate (to draw more cards), Frolic (cheer up their VIBE), Share (give cards back and forth with other players), and finally COOPERATE (work with other players).  A sample COOPERATE action is the Car Wash: you can't have a car wash with just one person!  There are limited number of COOPERATE actions, so they must be used strategically!<br/><br/>Players can play in any order on their turn to augment another player's turn: this is called Player Selected Turn Order, but it just means you can play in the order that best helps the players!<br/><br/>CO-OP is a game where players work together to discover the best way to balance VIBE, Money, Goods, and cards (Customers and Distributors).  We have to make enough money to save the CO-OP ($10), but we can't give in to the man ... everyone needs to be Groovy or Awesome!<br/><br/>"}, "214966": {"poll": [], "name": "Dauntless", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1296438.png", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Phoenix Labs"], "videogamefranchise": ["(Unreleased Games - Unavailable)"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "videogamehonor": ["2017 PAX Curse Award Best Co-op Game of the Year Winner", "2017 PAX Curse Award Best Multiplayer of the Year Winner", "2017 PAX Curse Award Editor\u2019s Choice Winner"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Phoenix Labs"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1296438_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Heroic fantasy game.<br/><br/>"}, "214967": {"boardgamedesigner": ["David Pontious"], "average": "10", "poll": [], "name": "Safe zone", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Press Your Luck"], "yearpublished": "2017", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3376863_t.png", "boardgameartist": ["Jarod DePugh"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3376863.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["World War II"], "age": "14", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Safe Zone  is an exciting new WWII themed board game for 2 players.

Two more monsters (or your boss) appear on your path.<br/><br/>During the Dawn, the towers can attack one monster of a particular type on one of the 4 adjacent spaces, or the boss.<br/><br/>During the Day, each player can make one action between four, then they can make one more action, it can be the same.<br/><br/>Finally, the first player token goes to the next player.<br/><br/>THE ACTIONS<br/><br/>There is 4 different actions:<br/> - Build a tower<br/> - Extend your path<br/> - Go to the market (apply one of the available Market cards)<br/> - Make a quest (draw two cards in the Market deck)<br/><br/>In addition, you can play one of your Market cards in your hand after each of the three first actions, the best way to play more actions.<br/><br/>THE MONSTERS AND THE BOSS<br/><br/>Each monster type has a movement value (between 1 to 3 spaces) and maybe a special ability.

But sometimes, it can be fun to take on the mantle of the otherworldly, and to embrace the alien terrors of the cosmos.

From H.P. Lovecraft&rsquo;s The Whisperer in Darkness and The Fungi from Yuggoth, this deceptive and uncaring alien race is a staple of the Cthulhu mythos. Whether they mention the mi-go directly or not, each archetype in this book builds on themes of brain harvesting, deceptiveness, alien technology, and fungal biology. This book contains the following archetypes:<br/><br/>    The Yuggothian surgeon, an alchemist archetype that slowly transforms into a fungal creature, and can numb victims with a touch.<br/>    The brain mage, an arcanist archetype that stores his spells in harvested brains, and can use captured brains in a variety of eldritch manners.<br/>    The fungal stalker, a hunter archetype that gains a mi-go companion, and can borrow skills from harvested brains.<br/>    The agent of Yuggoth, a rogue archetype with a focus on fleshwarping and a fungal anatomy.<br/>    The servant of Yuggoth, a witch archetype who stores spells in captured brains, and gains access to a variety of mi-go themed hexes.<br/>    A bonus cleric domain devoted to those who adhere to the strange religion of the mi-go.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "214999": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Forrest-Pruzan Creative"], "average": "5.66667", "poll": [], "name": "The Lion Guard: Roaring Rescue Game", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3319708_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Wonder Forge"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3319708.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game"], "age": "3", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>A Surprise Slides Adventure.<br/><br/>Journey through the Pride Lands, helping friends along the way!<br/><br/>Friends of the Lion Guard need a helping hand to get to Pride Rock, and only Kion, Beshte, Bunga and Fuli can find the way.
