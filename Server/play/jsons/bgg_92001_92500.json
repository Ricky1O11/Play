The arcade version is notable for using a horizontally aligned monitor (much like Treasure Co. Ltd's Radiant Silvergun), something that is considered rare for a vertical shooter.<br/><br/>Giga Wing takes place during a fictional war within a steampunk setting. The player controls one of four different futuristic aircraft and must destroy enemy aircraft, tanks, ships, and buildings using both guns and missiles mounted on the aircraft and a limited supply of bombs which damage or destroy all enemies on-screen when used. The game is based on the player(s) trying to destroy a medallion which possesses great power. Many of the bosses use the medallion as a weapon. At the end, it shows that an evil man who pilots a ship called the &quot;Stranger&quot; is the real person who is in control of the Medallion, and was responsible for the war, as well as other conflicts in the past including World War 2, and you fight him three times as a mini-boss and as the last boss. He appears to be a friend of Stuck 30 years ago when you fight him with Stuck.<br/><br/>There are four different characters in the game, and each of them has their own individual storyline. Players can also do team play mode that has two characters at once, creating a new storyline. In each storyline, there are two endings. In the bad ending, the character the player uses will sacrifice their life in a kamikaze attack that destroys the Medallion. In team up mode, generally one of the character does this, but in sometimes both characters survive. In the good endings for either solo or team play, the characters don't sacrifice themselves.<br/><br/>The player chooses one of four different craft and shoots through seven stages.

The characters use the stats from their character card, special dice (with hearts, potions and stars) are only used for combat and checks. If the heroes wound the opponent, they may draw loot cards to improve their stats. There is also the possibility to open treasure chests to find even more powerful things. The monsters have no possibility to &quot;level up&quot; apart from a single late game upgrade but the Dark Consul has an unlimited number of them.<br/><br/>To win the game, the Dark Consul must defeat all heroes in his dungeon.

This game is part of the Lunar series.<br/><br/>The story takes place approximately one thousand years after the events of Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete. Once again, Lunar (an inhabited moon that circles a planet called The Blue Star) is endangered, this time by the return of Zophar, the God of Evil responsible for the destruction of life on the Blue Star millennia before. This causes Lucia, a being assigned the task of eventually reviving life on the Blue Star, to awaken before her time and set forth on a mission to once again eliminate Zophar's influence.<br/>The story then unfolds from the perspective of Hiro, a teenaged archaeologist who resides in the Salyan Desert with his grandparent and adolescent dragon companion Ruby (who, like Nall in the previous game, resembles a talking, winged cat). The game begins with Hiro and Ruby pilfering a Dragon's Eye jewel from one of the several ancient ruins in their region. The escapade ends with Hiro inadvertently setting off a trap that forces them to flee from the ruins and ultimately prevents their return.<br/>On the way back to the research outpost, Hiro and Ruby are stopped by a principle member of Althena's Guards, the arrogant and boisterous White Knight Leo, who informs them that a 'Destroyer' is to appear at the ruins to the Northwest and that they should return to their homes immediately. Upon arriving at their home, the two find Leo attempting to extract information about the nearby ruins (referred to as 'The Blue Spire') from their grandfather Gwyn, an elderly archaeologist, in the hope of achieving access to the ruins' impenetrable interior. Finding Gwyn of little use, Leo departs, leaving the three of them to ponder the arrival of the so-called 'Destroyer'. When Hiro climbs to the roof to survey the status of their surroundings, he witnesses a mysterious light emanating from the Blue Spire. He informs his grandfather of the strange phenomenon, and the three of them decide to investigate the ruins for themselves.<br/><br/>The differences between this title and Lunar: Eternal Blue on Sega CD are numerous. The Lunar 2 remake implements many of the same gameplay revisions as are found in Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete; there are no battles on the overworld and no random encounters. Also like Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete, the size of most of Lunar 2's many dungeons decreased substantially from the original game. Four dungeons were cut from the remake, and several new ones were added (the exact number varies from Saturn to PlayStation). The Magic Experience system from the original game does not appear in the remake. The graphics are more detailed than in the original release, due to the higher resolution and broader color palette of 32-bit platforms, compared with the Sega CD. While many monsters from the Sega CD version recur, they are all redrawn, and a number of bosses look quite different. The overall number of full-motion video (FMV) cutscenes in Lunar 2: Eternal Blue Complete is about 35, significantly reduced from the original MegaCD/SegaCD version's 61. A number of short, scene-setting cutscenes and minor character introductions were cut from the remake. Despite this, the total amount of FMV time is longer in the remake because many scenes were extended.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Lunar 2: Eternal Blue Complete&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "92232": {"rpgdesigner": ["Adam Bank", "David Chart", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Darmont", "Micha\u00ebl de Verteuil", "Jeremiah Genest", "Andrew Gronosky", "Eric Minton", "Mark Shirley", "Mike Sloothaak", "Sheila Thomas", "David Woods"], "statistics": [], "name": "Hermes' Portal (Issue 6 - Nov 2002)", "rpgartist": ["Radja Sauperamaniane", "Angela Taylor", "Alexander White"], "rpgproducer": ["Eric Kouris", "Sheila Thomas"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic912232.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Hermes' Portal"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Ars Sympathia", "Dear Abelard", "Ex Bibliotheca Magvilli", "Heretic's Corner: The Unbearable Lightness of Reading", "Monty's Back", "News From the Line Editor", "Omnibus Grimoire", "Publisher's Corner", "Saint Walaric's Lures", "The Miraculous World", "The Separation of Church and Order", "Twilight Ageing Revisited", "Who's Who"], "rpg": ["Ars Magica (4th Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Hermes' Portal"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic912232_t.jpg", "description": "Hermes' Portal<br/>Issue 6<br/>An Independent Ars Magica Publication<br/><br/>"}, "92233": {"rpgdesigner": ["Adam Bank", "Micha\u00ebl de Verteuil", "Jeremiah Genest", "Andrew Gronosky", "Robert Hansen", "Eric Minton", "Carlos de la Cruz Morales", "Scott D.

The player gains levels only through the successful completion of various quests.<br/><br/>The game is mostly in top-down style for the world maps, towns, and castles, but switches to a 3D style in the dungeons and in the museum.<br/><br/>Several different areas of the game, like games in towns and certain museum displays, allow the character to play in special mini-games, which, if done successfully, will permanently increase attributes. Also, various casinos about the towns let players gamble to win money. It is also possible to rob banks in cities, but this attracts the attention of the town guards, who will remember the robbery until the player enters another town.<br/><br/>From the game box<br/><br/>Rich Graphics.<br/>Full-color, scrolling 3-D mazes. The flickering shadows of torchlight on moldy walls. The blood dripping from a monster's teeth. The richest graphics you've ever seen in a role-playing game.<br/><br/>Incredible Sound Effects<br/>The squish of swamp muck between you toes. Buzzing electric force fields. The echoing roar of your Kill Flash spell. You'll be amazed at the sounds your computer can make.<br/><br/>Enormous Variety<br/>You want a lot to do? Lots of choices? You've got it. A dangerous quest. A fast pace. Continents, oceans, wilderness, towns, dungeons, a castle and a fortress to explore. Puzzles. Gambling. Fighting. Magic.

The remake features all-new graphics and sound, and also incorporates gameplay elements from the later installments such as the use of body language to indicate the main character's health and the 180-degree turn. In addition, it introduced a new running style that was also used in Resident Evil Zero, and several new areas were added to the game. The overall plot remains largely unchanged. The original live-action FMV segments were redone in CG, with the voice acting done by a new cast. The script was rewritten to have a more serious tone and improved translation, as opposed to the unprofessional dialogue and roughly-translated script of the original. Gameplay mechanics are largely the same although most of the puzzles have been changed and the player can equip a defensive weapon that can be used when seized by an enemy.<br/><br/>Additionally, the remake features many unlockable game modes, secrets, and various endings not found in the original.

One player assumes the role of the British (including Canadian) forces, and the other plays the Americans. This often-overlooked conflict ended in a draw historically, but this was not the only possible outcome. The Americans clearly wished to annex Canada to their young nation, while the British wanted to teach their former colonies a lesson. The game includes all of the theaters of battle from the war: the US/ Canadian border and the Great Lakes (of course) but also the wilderness of the old Northwest, the Atlantic coast of the US, the Civilized Indians of the south, and the site of the final conflict at New Orleans.<br/><br/>Each turn represents a few months of time (depending on the season). A typical turn consists of dealing out to each player the number of cards indicated on the turn track. The winter and spring turns require a few special tasks. The Americans will have more resources to commit to the war- until Napoleon is defeated in Europe, and the English player can focus more resources on their efforts in North America. Each card can be played for the event described on the card, or for the card&rsquo;s Operations Points, to move Expeditions, build ships and fortifications, or raise troops.<br/><br/>Events on the cards and on the map will cause the markers on the Peace Track to move forward.  This represents the war weariness of each side&rsquo;s people: bad events will cause your people to demand peace.  Most events push inexorably towards peace; only a few rally your people for a longer war. When the two markers meet on the Peace Track, the game proceeds to the negotiations at Ghent, and the winner is determined.

It is the sixth game in the Ace Attorney series, and a sequel to Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth.<br/><br/>Gyakuten Kenji 2 features the same three main characters from its predecessor: prosecutor Miles Edgeworth; detective Dick Gumshoe; and Kay Faraday, a teenage girl who is also an avid thief. One case of the game takes place at Gourd Lake, a setting from the first game of the series, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. The character of Shelly de Killer from Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Justice for All returns in one case. A new female judge, named Hakari Mikagami, is introduced and serves as Edgeworth's rival in this game; character designer Tatsurou Iwamoto wanted to create an older woman he could look up to. Mikagami is part of a &quot;Prosecutor Purge&quot;, following the actions of weaker prosecutors to justify removing them from duty; the game starts with Mikagami attempting to take a case under Edgeworth's command to another prosecutor, Yumihiko Ichiyanagi.<br/><br/>The game features gameplay largely reminiscent of its predecessor, Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth, with the &quot;Investigation&quot;, &quot;Logic&quot; and &quot;Confrontation&quot; modes returning. A new element involves &quot;Chess Logic&quot;. During conversations with certain characters, the player must find a weakness in the conversation within a limited amount of time. The player is given two choices of dialog. At times one of these pieces will show a chess piece; the player, if they believe they have an advantage in the conversation over the other character, can select the chess piece option. If the player does not yet have the advantage, they will lose some of the time meter, and will have to continue asking other probing questions in order to further build up their advantage. However, if the player does have an advantage, as represented by the relative strength of the chess pieces shown, they will succeed in overthrowing the character's conversation and progress in the game.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Gyakuten Kenji 2&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "92395": {"poll": [], "name": "The Granstream Saga", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European PlayStation edition", "North American PlayStation edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2082550.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Soul Blazer"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["Arc Entertainment", "Shade"], "videogamegenre": ["Action RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation"], "average": "5.5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sony Computer Entertainment", "THQ"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2082550_t.jpg", "description": "The Granstream Saga (\u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30e0\u4f1d\u8a18 Guransutor\u012bmu Denki) is an action role-playing game for the PlayStation.

Professor Layton vs. Turnabout Trial) is a crossover adventure puzzle video game joint-developed by Level-5 and Capcom and published by Nintendo (Level-5 in Japan) for the Nintendo 3DS. The game is a crossover between Level-5's Professor Layton puzzle series and Capcom's Ace Attorney adventure series, combining gameplay elements from both series. The game features scenario designs from Shu Takumi, the series director for the Ace Attorney series. The game was released in Japan on November 29, 2012, March 28, 2014 in Europe and March 29, 2014 in Australia. It was released in North America on August 29, 2014.<br/><br/>The game follows Professor Layton, Luke Triton, Phoenix Wright and Maya Fey as they attempt to solve the mystery of Labyrinthia. The game has two main styles of gameplay, Adventure and Witch Trial, which feature elements from the Professor Layton and Ace Attorney series respectively. The game features voice acting and animated cutscenes, a staple in the Professor Layton games but a first for the Ace Attorney series.<br/><br/>Adventure<br/>See also: Gameplay in the Professor Layton series<br/>During Adventure segments, players can explore various environments, conversing with characters and examining background objects in order to find clues to solving the mystery of Labyrinthia. The control scheme is similar to the one introduced in Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask, in which players navigate the environments by moving around a cursor on the screen. Investigating certain areas or conversing with certain characters reveals various puzzles, which task players with finding its solution. Solving these puzzles earn Picarats, with more earned for making fewer mistakes, which go towards unlocking bonus content. Throughout these sections, players may also find Hint Coins which can be spent to unlock hints whilst solving puzzles.<br/><br/>Witch Trial<br/>See also: Gameplay in the Ace Attorney series<br/>In the Witch Trial sections, players take control of Phoenix Wright as he cross-examines witnesses in order to defend his client. Whilst cross-examining a witness, the player can press them for more details, which can sometimes yield new information. The player's main task is to look for contradictions in the witness statements and present the evidence that contradicts their statement. If the player presents the wrong evidence at the wrong time, the player will lose a strike, with the game ending if the player loses all of their strikes. This time around, Phoenix will occasionally have to cross-examine multiple witnesses at once. Whilst pressing one witness, another may react to one of their statements, and questioning them may yield new information or evidence. In addition to the Court Record, which contains evidence on the case, Phoenix also has access to the Grand Grimoire, a book of magic spells which can also be used as evidence. Hint coins found during the Adventure segments can also be used during trials, providing hints on how the player should progress. Additional Picorats are earned at the end of each trial based on how many strikes are remaining.<br/><br/>Downloadable content<br/>Level-5 announced that they would release downloadable content for the game, including a new storyline, written by Shu Takumi, which will be split up in 12 episodes. It is playable when the game has been cleared once. The downloadable content, which included new puzzles and gallery items, was released every Wednesday for 24 weeks, starting on December 12, 2012, with the different kinds of downloadable content alternating each week.<br/><br/>In PAL regions, the content will be offered in a similar manner, starting with a story episode on the game's release date, and then new content will be released every week until the start of September.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "92397": {"poll": [], "name": "Avatar: The Last Airbender \u2013 The Burning Earth", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Australian PlayStation 2 edition", "Australian Wii edition", "Australian Xbox 360 edition", "English/European PlayStation 2 edition", "English/European Wii edition", "English/European Xbox 360 edition", "German Xbox 360 edition", "North American PlayStation 2 edition", "North American Wii edition", "North American Xbox 360 edition", "Xbox 360 Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1074592.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Anime", "Cartoon", "Children's", "Fantasy", "Martial Arts"], "videogamefranchise": ["Avatar: The Last Airbender"], "videogamedeveloper": ["THQ Studio Australia"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2", "Wii", "Xbox 360"], "usersrated": "3", "average": "5.41667", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["THQ"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1074592_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Avatar: The Last Airbender &ndash; The Burning Earth is an action adventure title for the Wii, Playstation 2, and Xbox 360.

It is also longer than most PSX offerings, with total gameplay time averaging between 124 and 144 hours.

Lovecraft&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dreams in the Witch House&rdquo; describes a disturbing series of encounters between a theoretical mathematician, a furtive ratlike creature named &ldquo;Brown Jenkin,&rdquo; and what very well might be the spirit of a 17th-century sorceress. Jenkin served as the familiar of Keziah Mason, a cunning old woman who escaped Arkham&rsquo;s witch trials by opening a gate to another dimension. Centuries later, Walter Gilman used mathematical acumen and lucid dreaming to access this forgotten realm. By his reckless investigation, he released an ancient horror into his moldering garret apartment inside the now infamous &ldquo;Witch House.&rdquo;<br/><br/>In May of 1931, most of the Witch House was destroyed by a terrible storm, but the fate of Keziah Mason remains a point of some conjecture. Workers sorting through the rubble found the gnawed bodies of several children who had disappeared from Arkham over the years, along with the corpse of a twisted, ratlike thing, and the bent and desiccated remains of an elderly woman.<br/><br/>Many occultists and investigators perusing reports on the Witch House have concluded that the withered old body was indeed the remains of Keziah Mason. Yet a few harbor doubts. What if the corpse wasn&rsquo;t the old witch, but one of her victims? Or even worse, what if the corpse had been preserved in that state for centuries&hellip; even after the spirit of Keziah Mason passed into an otherworldly dimension bordering on our own? Was her familiar, Brown Jenkin, a unique anomaly, or is it possible that the beldame has since instructed other hyperintelligent creatures in her dark arts?<br/><br/>For enthusiasts of the macabre, this web enhancement presents an &ldquo;adventure fragment&rdquo; based on these possibilities. Like similar fragments for the original Call of Cthulhu Roleplaying Game, it contains the outline of a brief story, a handful of encounters, and guidelines for the various &ldquo;crunchy bits&rdquo; of the rules. This fragment, however, adapts the game mechanics for the d20 system. With a minimal amount of preparation and a copy of the Call of Cthulhu d20 Roleplaying Game, a Gamemaster can use this fragment to prepare anything from a short introductory adventure playable in one evening to the foundation for a tireless crusade against an ancient and insidious evil. This bonus material is an exclusive feature of the Wizards of the Coast website.<br/><br/>The first half of this story, intended for four or five 1st-level investigators, should be playable in a single evening. It&rsquo;s a simple, straightforward investigation in which most of the characters (this time, at least) should survive without much difficulty. The body count is minimal, but the implications are horrendous. The second half not only details the consequences of that investigation, but also offers a possible foundation for an ongoing campaign. Some of the particulars concerning rat-things could be used in other adventures as well.<br/><br/>"}, "92426": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Eko Nugroho"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "name": "WordPress Board Game", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1048587_t.png", "boardgameartist": ["Brendan Satria A."], "boardgamepublisher": ["Kummara"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1048587.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "poll": [], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "In the game, each player takes a role as a web developer who works on a team to set a new blog by implementing the WordPress engine.

Ancient rivals join forces. The winds of change are blasting across the worlds of the Inner Sphere, and the battle for Coventry is the center of the storm!<br/><br/>In early 3058, following the disastrous Trial of Refusal with Clan Wolf, Clan Jade Falcon launches a brutal campaign against the Lyran Alliance to regain its status among the invading Clans. As the Lyran Alliance tries desperately to marshal the necessary troops to stop this invasion at Coventry, military forces from all the major powers in the Inner Sphere converge on the war-torn planet. With massive troops poised on both sides of the conflict, the battle for Coventry threatens to explode into an all-out war with the Clans once again! Will the Truce of Tukayyid hold?<br/><br/>The Battle of Coventry is a BattleTech scenario pack that describes the savage conflict between Clan Jade Falcon and defending forces of the Inner Sphere on the planet Coventry. A detailed description of the hard-fought battle, along with seventeen scenarios and special campaign rules, allows players to recreate the events that unfolded in the BattleTech novel Malicious Intent - and perhaps even change the course of history.<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>This is another Clan vs the Inner Sphere scenario pack from FASA, containing 17 assorted scenarios and the details on one new Clan OmniMech, the Cougar, which was reprinted a couple of years later in BattleTech Technical Readout: 3060. This scenario pack is similar to the earlier Luthien scenario pack, in that it brings along a multi-national force to represent the Inner Sphere; with units such as the Com Guard, Wolf's Dragoons, the Eridani Light Horse, the Davion Heavy Guards and others to choose from, it's a good opportunity to play your favourite unit from the novel on which the scenarios are drawn. Thanks to the inclusion of the Com Guard Invader Galaxy, it's also possibly the only scenario pack where the Inner Sphere player will go into a battle or two equipped to the same technological level as the opposing Clan.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "6.66667", "name": "BattleTech: The Battle for Coventry", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": ["BattleTech"], "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": ["BattleTech", "Country: England"]}, "92431": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Chronicles of Yzra the Crow: A Player\u2019s Campaign Accessory", "rpgdesigner": ["Joshua Raynack"], "rpgproducer": ["Ryan Rawls", "Joshua Raynack", "Heather Raynack"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic915455.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Feudal Lords"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Alea Publishing Group"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic915455_t.jpg", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>I am Ysra the Crow.

Betrayal of one&rsquo;s closest allies. Several days ago each player received a letter playing upon that fear.<br/><br/>Because each dream is read to each PC individually, the player&rsquo;s initial thought should be that he is the betrayor, and perhaps he may wish to mask that fact from his broodmates. In truth, every member of the brood betrayed a group . . . but that group was never the brood, and the betrayal was always performed on the brood&rsquo;s behalf.<br/><br/>A strange creature with mysterious motives, a resident of the dream city of Babylon, has entered the players&rsquo; dreams and obscured them. It hopes to turn the brood against one another so that it may live in the dark and distrusting places amidst their brood mind; a fully-formed and well defended brood mind is too clear and open a construct for its purposes.<br/><br/>The true challenge of the adventure, therefore, will not be whether or not the PCs can overcome their foes in battle or outwit each other, but rather whether or not they can trust one another.<br/><br/>A GenCon 2005 Runner-Up Adventure<br/><br/>"}, "92434": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Fireborn"], "statistics": [], "name": "Lock, Stock, and Three Smoking Souls", "rpgdesigner": ["Mike Montesa"], "rpgproducer": ["Mike Montesa"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic915450.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "7", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Modern"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic915450_t.jpg", "description": "From Adventure Background:<br/><br/>Ages ago, a brood of dragons failed to accomplish a task set to them by the fae.

Each time they have re-incarnated, they come together. But as they re-connect with their previous lives, they remember their ages-old failure (and falling out), begin arguing, and again fail to complete their original task.

Granted, these elements alone hardly mark the play as different from any of the Bard&rsquo;s other tragedies. What makes Othello unique, however, is the title character; the play&rsquo;s tragic hero.

The game is a spin-off of the game Prince of Persia (2008.)<br/><br/>The plot, taking place in ancient Persia, concerns the player character's role in a celestial battle between two gods; Ahriman and Ormazd. The player assumes the role of the Prince, and Zal, fighting Ahriman's forces with a variety of different physical and magical attacks.<br/><br/>Following the events of Prince of Persia and Prince of Persia Epilogue, the story begins with the split of the Prince and Elika. While Elika stays with the Ahura, leading the resistance against Ahriman, the Prince departs in search of the king of The City of New Dawn, in the hope that he can summon Ormazd, due to his affinity for the remnants of Ormazd's power. But here, the Prince finds a new ally, Zal, who introduces himself as one of the king's Magi and teams up with Prince to save the City of New Dawn from corruption and ultimately stop Ahriman.<br/><br/>The main objective of the game is to collect four pieces to a magical seal which will banish the evil god Ahriman from the region. The Nintendo DS stylus is used to maneuver the Prince by touching the touchscreen. The stylus is used to move the Prince, to do acrobatic moves, in combat, and to use Zal's magic. As the Prince and Zal progress in their adventure, Zal becomes Corrupted at certain points, in which the Prince has to pursue and defeat him. Sometimes, after being defeated, Zal gains new powers. These powers allow him and the Prince to perform gradually more advanced platforming maneuvers.<br/><br/>Platforming is done by using the Nintendo DS stylus, and tapping the touchscreen in the direction the player wants the Prince to move. For example, if the player wants to run up a wall, and jump back onto a rope, the player must first tap up the wall, then tap the rope. Sometimes, platforming implements combat as well. Combat is also done using the Nintendo DS stylus. There are three combat options; a sword strike, which causes the Prince to swing his sword to damage enemies; a block move, where the Prince defends himself against enemies; and a magic power triggered by Zal that does no damage, but causes the enemy to recoil, pushing them back should the duo be overwhelmed.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Prince of Persia: The Fallen King,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "92464": {"poll": [], "name": "Avatar: The Last Airbender (PC)", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Australian Windows edition", "English/European Windows edition", "North American Windows edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Anime", "Cartoon", "Children's", "Fantasy", "Martial Arts"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure"], "videogamedeveloper": ["AWE Productions Inc."], "videogamefranchise": ["Avatar: The Last Airbender"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["THQ"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Avatar: The Last Airbender is an action adventure title for Windows.

The first player to collect seven of one type of victory card wins the game.<br/><br/>This game is based on hex-grid map boards and players can choose which sections of the map to assemble. Currently there are maps of Europe and the Caribbean, although plans for future maps will cover the entire world. Players lay tiles down to form cities and can build military units to protect them or attack others. Cities create the wealth that a player needs to further their empire.<br/><br/>Players take turns to perform their moves, building their empire up while keeping a close eye on their neighbors to prevent them beating them to the end. Open play allows players to watch other players activities, and manage resources in way that can stop other players winning while not hindering their own advancement.<br/><br/>The game has been designed to give flexibility to the rules so that players can develop in-house versions of the rules without breaking the game. One popular alteration is in the collection of cards. Players can change the speed and dynamic of the game by changing how many and of which types of card need to be collected.<br/><br/>The game is fully customizable allowing players to design their own versions including army units, maps, technologies and rules.

Agon disappeared while working on the mystical powers of the human mind. His Victorian mansion was left undisturbed, until one day you discover the iron gate opened.

After reading the notes, you find out the Eidolon is a travelling machine, capable of transporting its pilot to strange mystical dimensions. You feel a sudden desire to start the machine...<br/><br/>The Eidolon is an arcade exploration game. The player pilots the machine in caves, collecting jewels and energy balls and looking for the dragon guarding the entry to the next level. The Eidolon can shoot four different energy balls: red balls are the most destructive, green balls transform a monster into a different one, blue balls stop time (freezing the target for a few seconds) and yellow balls heal. Shooting costs energy, so the player must pick up gold balls to replenish the machine's reserves. Jewels are needed to breach the energy barrier preventing access to the dragon; there are three on each level, each guarded  by a different creature.<br/><br/>The game uses fractal algorithms to create the real-time 3D display of the cave environment.<br/><br/>"}, "92044": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic994288.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Richard Baker", "Mons Johnson", "Peter Lee"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Wayne England", "Adam Gillespie", "William O'Connor"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Hasbro", "Wizards of the Coast"], "maxplaytime": "240", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic994288_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Fantasy", "Wargame"], "boardgamehonor": ["2011 Origins Awards Best Board Game Winner", "2011 Origins Awards Best Boardgame Nominee"], "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>&quot;War has come to the Dungeons &amp; Dragons world!

Within, you will find rules optimized for a fast-playing, movie-like experience with scenarios that can be played in a single session. It is assumed that at least one player has roleplaying experience.<br/><br/>Characters are created on a point-based system that allows you to design the type of character you want to play without restrictive classes and levels. As befits the concept, combat and action resolution is fast and everything in the game can be resolved with a single die roll of two or more dice. More advanced rules are also included if you wish to increase the level of detail. Additionally, HardNova comes complete with several game scenarios and a complete list of pre-generated and non-player characters that let you jump right into the action.<br/><br/>HardNova is predicated on the classic space opera epics found in movies, comics, television shows, and books from the last several decades. Characters can be found in interstellar adventures on quests for fame and fortune among the stars, bold explorers seeking out new worlds, space pirates plying the shipping lanes in search of easy prey, mystical psions with mental powers, or just about anything else that comes to mind. The rules in HardNova will allow you to explore all the possibilities of good space opera fantasy, either through the use of the included scenarios or of those you design on your own. So suit up, initiate the hyperdrive sequence, and take to the stars!<br/><br/>"}, "92065": {"videogame": ["Bosconian", "Dig Dug", "Dig Dug II", "Dragon Buster", "Galaga", "Galaxian", "Grobda", "King & Balloon", "Mappy", "Motos", "Ms. Pac-Man", "New Rally-X", "Pac-Man", "Rally-X", "Rolling Thunder", "The Tower of Druaga", "Xevious"], "poll": [], "name": "Namco Museum Battle Collection", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Hotseat", "Local Multiplayer", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Australian PSP edition", "English/European PSP edition", "German PSP edition", "Japanese PSP edition", "Korean PSP edition", "North American PSP edition", "North American PSP Greatest Hits edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1356413.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Namco Museum"], "videogametheme": ["Abstract", "Amusement Park", "Animals", "Cute Fantasy", "Driving", "Fantasy", "Puzzle", "Science Fiction", "Space", "Spy / Espionage"], "usersrated": "4", "videogamedeveloper": ["Namco Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade", "Classic Games"], "videogameplatform": ["PSP"], "average": "7.75", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Namco Ltd.", "Sony Computer Entertainment"], "videogamecompilation": ["Bosconian", "Dig Dug", "Dig Dug II", "Dragon Buster", "Galaga", "Galaxian", "Grobda", "King & Balloon", "Mappy", "Motos", "Ms. Pac-Man", "New Rally-X", "Pac-Man", "Rally-X", "Rolling Thunder", "The Tower of Druaga", "Xevious"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1356413_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Namco Museum Battle Collection is a compilation title of 17 classic arcade games developed by Namco.

Some of them might have reasons; some reasons might stem from a childhood of horrific abuse. But the fact remains they kill because some part of their mind wants to kill.<br/><br/>Some of them are smart. Some of them are unbelievably intricate. Some of them weave complex plots around what they are doing. Serial killers might evade police for years, or, as in the case of The Green River Killer in Seattle, forever.

First to 4 disks of his or her color (out of 7) on the inner ring wins...<br/><br/>Equipment: Each player is a color. Choose a color to be neutral. Players need: The board, 10 disks per player (separate into 7 and 3), a figure for each player, 6 bars of a neutral color (separate into 3 and 3), 9 disks of the neutral color, the figure of the neutral color, the gray figure, and the deck (without trilithon cards).<br/><br/>During a player&rsquo;s turn, he has 1 of 3 actions that he can take:<br/><br/>- Move as many neutral disks from a single inside cup. Take the disks into your hand. You will replace them after taking an action or two. For each disk taken in hand, you may move a component in the corresponding section to the left or right 1 space. You may move any component even if it is not your color. You may use multiple energy disks to affect a single component or spread them out as you wish. You may move the component into a new section, but cannot continue to affect it this turn (since it is in a different section, and disks from a certain cup only affect the corresponding section).<br/><br/>If you a place component onto a spot that is occupied, the component on the spot is moved either left, right, in, or out 1 space as per your choice (no more out than the outer track, no more in than the inner track. Again, it is possible to push a component to another section). It is possible that moving the component pushes it into another occupied space, in which case, repeat the above process until there is no conflict.<br/><br/>After using all disks in a cup that you want, take the disks that are in the hand and place them into different cups that the one they originated from. You may place the disks into inside OR outside cups, and you can split them up as you choose (all in one cup or split into multiple cups, etc.). This is supposed to represent energy conversion, which is necessary for casting a spell<br/><br/>- Move as many outside energy disks as you want (regardless of the section they are in). Likewise, take them into hand first, and after taking an action per disk, replace them in different cups than the one(s) from which they originated.<br/><br/>For each disk moved, you may move your figure, the neutral figure, or the gray figure 1, 5, or 20 spaces in either direction as long the figure is in the section the disk was in. You may use multiple disks on a single figure (i.e., move a figure 20 spaces using a disk in one cup, and then another 2 spaces using 2 disks from a different cup. If you move the figure onto a space occupied by another figure, both figures simply occupy the same spot (nothing special).<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s movement, but you can also move components using the outer cups. If yours, the neutral&rsquo;s, or the grey figure is on the inner track on the same space as a component, you may use an energy disk from an outside cup to pull the component in 1 space, or push it out 1 space. If you push/pull a disk into another, the disk is displaced as described above. If a disk is pulled down to the inner track, it gets pulled to the space the figure is on<br/><br/>- Take any 2 neutral disks and put them into your hand. You may take these 2 from the same or different cups. Just before your next turn, place them in any cup or cups of your choice.<br/><br/>For recap, the 3 actions are: a) take as many energy disks from a single inside cup, b) take as many energy disks as you want from outside cups, or c) take 2 disks off the board for a turn.<br/><br/>As a special bonus, if a component of your color gets to the inner track, you may place one of your 3 extra disks on any cup of your choice. This counts as a disk that only you may use. When you use it, move it as any other disk in a cup. Also, once a component is on the inner track, it cannot be moved and no other component may move to that spot. Figures may ignore it for the sake of movement, and just move on top of it or through it.<br/>Ending the Game<br/><br/>When a player has gotten 4 of the 7 components into the inner track, he casts the spell, and thus wins.

People told me all the time that the game could not be done, that the problems of writing rules for a genre that was built around the mental and emotional states of player characters were insurmountable. When the game was published in 2002, the execution was far from perfect but I am proud to say that many fans have embraced the concepts and ideals of HeartQuest.<br/><br/>When 2003 came around, our desire to extend the line and expand our company led to a desire to revise HeartQuest, fix the problems that people had noticed and that we had discovered, and expand the possibilities of the game further still. This led to mecha rules, new settings and a complete revision of some systems. It also led to a thorough copyedit of the entire book and the commissioning of a ton of new art. It is now the Spring of 2004, and the result of our efforts is the book you hold in your hands today.<br/><br/>Many of you are joining the HeartQuest community for the first time with this edition. To you, I offer a warm and hearty welcome. Let me be the first to show you the delights of shoujo roleplaying. The experiences you will have with this game are found in no other roleplaying game on the market today. As you develop your own campaign setting, adapt your favorite anime or manga series, or explore any of the half-dozen campaign settings offered in this book, you will find yourself stretched in new directions. Roleplaying is as much about self-discovery as it is about taking on another persona, and there's lot more to this game than defeating enemies.

As an Eidolon - an immortal force of nature - your path is clear. Find the lost fragments of Grand Cornerstone and rebuild the world according to your own design.<br/><br/>Mystic Empyrean is a roleplaying game of social character development, creation, and puzzle solving. Players must work together to rebuild the world from a few tattered remains, and then explore their own creations in order to find more pieces of the world.<br/><br/>The player characters, Eidolons, are beings of immense power, granted a body of pure life energy and formed by the desires and designs of their hearts. Eidolons develop new powers based upon their personalities. To be consumed by greed will give an Eidolon the power to create gold with a touch. To be fearful and furtive will grant the power to dissolve into shadow. Traits develop based upon how characters are role-played, rather than the assignment of experience or gaining of levels. This means that Eidolons will gain powers that reflect their actions and desires.<br/><br/>In Empyrean, the game builds itself as you play. No GM is responsible for creating encounters in advance of the game. Instead, players use the tools presented in the game guide, as well as their own imaginations, to create an adventure that is wholly unique for every group.<br/><br/>This preview contains everything you need to play a short game of Mystic Empyrean. You will get to see characters evolve and develop new powers based upon your roleplaying, as well as use the encounter seeds in the included guide to grow your own adventure organically.<br/><br/>The preview game requires only 10-sided dice to play.

Indeed, other units of the Inner Sphere validate their prowess by surviving an encounter with the Dragoons. Among their ranks is Natasha Kerensky, known as the Black Widow, and perhaps the most romanticized MechWarrior in history.<br/><br/>The strategic and tactical knowledge of Jaime Wolf, the heart and soul of the Dragoons, is beyond reproach.<br/><br/>The unit's supplies and equipment are of the finest quality. Their 'Mechs never want for repair parts. Their ranks are closed and private.<br/><br/>Since appearing in the Inner Sphere in 3005, the Dragoons have been employed in turn by every house of the Successor States. No amount of money, political power, or threats have coerced them to renew a contract. Speculation and conjecture over their motives and origin are commonplace and wildly varied. Governmental intelligence and security networks have expended countless man-hours and C-bills trying to learn their secrets.<br/><br/>Now war consumes the Inner Sphere, and the Dragoons' contract with House Kurita has expired. Where they throw their support could determine the outcome of the war.<br/><br/>This ComStar document is the most accurate, up-to-date assemblage of information ever compiled about the Dragoons.

It is a class designed to lead others in battle, using (mostly) nonmagical talents to grant combat benefits to friends and followers, place enemies at disadvantages, and use the many arts of war in all aspects of his life. A war master is designed to allow both experienced tacticians and players with no sense of strategy to play a cunning commander able to turn the tide of battle with a quick command, clever stratagem, and strong sword-arm used in just the right way at just the right time.<br/><br/>The war master is a warrior, leader, and strategist. As their name might suggest, typical war masters are first and foremost military commanders, able to both slay foes directly and to aid his allies by suggesting various tactics and maneuvers to maximize their gifts and minimize their weaknesses. But the art of war is far more than the ability to kill and lead killers, and war masters must also learn at least some skills of negotiation, espionage, and organization to dominate all aspects of armed conflict. Similarly, the lessons learned in battle can often be applied in less violent venues, allowing war masters to see how to gain advantage in a wide range of situations.<br/><br/>"}, "92149": {"poll": [], "name": "Vampire: Master of Darkness", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Game Gear edition", "Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console edition", "UK Master System edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1368226.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Horror"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["SIMS Co., Ltd"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Scrolling"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo 3DS", "SEGA Game Gear", "SEGA Master System"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SEGA Corporation", "SIMS Co., Ltd"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1368226_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>Become the new Master!
