Tides of Time is a drafting game for two players. Each game consists of three rounds in which players draft cards from their hands to build their kingdom. Each card is one of five suits and also has a scoring objective.<br/><br/>After all cards have been drafted for the round, players total their points based on the suits of cards they collected and the scoring objectives on each card, then they record their score. Each round, the players each select one card to leave in their kingdom as a &quot;relic of the past&quot; to help them in later rounds. After three rounds, the player with the the most prosperous kingdom wins.<br/><br/>Tides of Madness adds a new twist to the above game: madness. Some cards, while powerful, harm your psyche, so you must keep an eye on your madness level or else risk losing the game early as your mind is lost to the power of the ancients. More specifically, eight of the eighteen cards in the game feature a madness icon, and while scoring, you receive a madness token for each such icon in your collection of cards. Whoever has the most madness in a round either scores 4 points or discards 1 madness token &mdash; and the latter option is valuable because if you ever have nine or more madness, you lose the game immediately.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "German first edition", "Polish first edition", "Spanish first edition"], "average": "7.14781", "name": "Tides of Madness", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Set Collection"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "1076", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Cthulhu Mythos"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["38 \u2013 The Family Gamers Podcast \u2013 Twice Married", "DJ107: Las Mareas del Tiempo (2015) Kristian \u010curla", "Ep 043 \u2013 Essen Part II Expansion Preview", "Episode 61 - Mansions of Madness 2nd Ed.

The possible states are as follows:<br/>1. Naked: The accessory token is off the character sheet and the character is flipped to the naked side<br/>2.

Weapon: The character has a weapon, armor, bra and panties (token on weapon space)<br/><br/>The game is divided into rounds, each round is split into phases. Note that some phases are played in clockwise order and some others in anticlockwise order.<br/><br/>Each player faces a round always with 3 cards in hand, drawing them from the central common deck.

The game crosses over heroines from various visual novels and games released by Nitroplus, as well as those from manga and anime series that Nitroplus writers have been involved with. The game was released in arcades on April 30, 2015 and was released on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 in collaboration with Marvelous Entertainment's Marvelous Inc. on December 10, 2015. Marvelous USA published the game in North America in February 2, 2016. It is the sequel to the doujin game Nitro+ Royale: Heroines Duel.<br/><br/>The game uses five buttons; light attack, medium attack, heavy attack, escape action, and heavy action.

Although this lack of evidence leads to disagreements over the details, every gamer has a clear personal picture of magic, psionics, super-powers, and similar phenomena.<br/><br/>But then there's the really strange stuff - the powers that push the limits of imagination itself.<br/><br/>GURPS Powers: The Weird is your guide to the mad science, uncanny realms, and bizarre superhuman abilities found in corners of fantasy, horror, and science fiction that attract labels like &quot;bizarro,&quot; &quot;psychedelic,&quot; and &quot;surreal.&quot; It goes beyond safe stereotypes to explore powers that warp the human form, sanity, and reality itself. Take a look, if you dare, and unearth:<br/><br/>Weird Science. Eleven structured styles of mad and fringe science - ranging from early psychical research and Frankensteinian experimentation to sci-fi nanotech and para-energetics - let you invent unlikely technologies, explore impossible realms, and tinker with the nature of life itself. What could go wrong?<br/><br/>Weird Realms and Phenomena. Learn of novel ways to use familiar story elements such as outer space and time travel to put a bizarre twist on your campaign . . . and discover completely new strangeness like singularities and metaphysical realms.<br/><br/>Weird Powers. The powers of Dimensional Control, Logos, Metamateriality, Mutation, Noumena, Para-Energy, Parasitism, and Void take GURPS Powers to the outer limits, with 65 fully worked sample abilities that push the boundaries of body, mind, and natural laws.<br/><br/>All of this comes with ample notes on the new and variant traits needed to think and act outside the box, plus plenty of advice to GMs who don't want to tether their campaigns to mere reality.

The group may cross out any sets of energy (beginning at the bottom) to reduce the overall game.<br/><br/>Starting The Game<br/>Each player begins with two dice. On your turn roll the two dice adding them for your total. As long as you didn't roll any ones you may continue to roll adding the two dice values to the last total. (This represents concentrating to build more power)You may stop at any time or if you roll any ones you must stop.<br/>If you roll identical numbers on any dice roll you gain a bonus to your total value by multiplying your total value (after adding this roll to it) by the number of identical numbers rolled.<br/>If all the numbers are the same on all the dice you rolled, you gain an additional dice. (So if you rolled two dice and both displayed a two. You would immediately gain another dice so from then on you get to roll three dice. If when rolling three dice, all three display a two, you gain another dice, immediately, so now you are rolling four dice. )<br/>When you stop rolling (concentrating) your total value is rounded to the closest five. Choose an opponent to blast. It's subtracted from the Energy on their force chart. Each box is worth five points so if you blast someone for 25 points they must cross out 5 boxes.<br/>Rolling ones represents losing your concentration. All points you accumulated this turn are lost and you take 5 points damage per 1 displayed on your dice in backlash, (if you rolled two 1's you would have to cross out 2 boxes). <br/>Backlash damage can not be defied.<br/><br/>Winning And Losing The Game<br/>To win you must be the only remaining player or you can share a win by calling a truce. <br/>Losing a game is to be reduced to zero energy or less than two dice.<br/><br/>Energy<br/>Your energy is displayed on the left of your force chart. It represents your life's energy. When all boxes are crossed out, you die! (lose). It's divided into sections. Each section has 100 health; four rows of five boxes, each worth 5 points. When all the boxes in one section are crossed off you lose one die to your rolls (if you have been rolling three dice on your turn, you would now be reduced to rolling only two).<br/><br/>Defiance<br/>Defiance is found on the right side of the force chart. At the beginning of each game you choose a number between 2 and 6. Every time this number is rolled you gain a defiance point which is marked by filling in a box in the defiance section. For each row you have filled you may cancel five points (one box) of damage from an opponent. Once you use it you must cross it out, each row can only be used once.<br/><br/>Concentration<br/>This represents your level of concentration by the number of dice you get to roll on your turn. It is found in the middle of the force chart. In the top box write the number 2 because everyone begins with two dice. Whenever the dice amount changes, mark it here.<br/>(Everyone begins with 2 dice. If you you gain another dice then in the box below the 2 write 3 as the new number of dice you can use on each of your turns.)<br/><br/>Trinity!<br/>Whenever you roll three of a kind (except ones) you may yell TRINITY! Thereby gaining its benefit.<br/>If you choose to yell Trinity, you must stop rolling and add this final roll to your total. Multiply it by the number of like dice (in this case at least three). Now you may split your attack between up to three opponents instead of just one. Plus any damage from a Trinity can not be defied.

As the meetings progressed a specialized design began to evolve that would eventually become the Broken Hill-class prospector. Construction of a prototype commenced in July 2287 and by the middle of 2288, the five hundredth anniversary year of the settlement of Australia, orders were placed by all four participant companies. This entailed an order of sixteen ships with options for additional hulls should the design prove itself in service.<br/><br/>The prospector allows for up to four mining cutters to dock and transfer mined ore to the two ore holds. There are two cargo locks on either side of the access and docking spine that directly deliver ore to a hold via a dump chute. The prospector can only carry two mining cutters externally but the added flexibility of allowing two more cutters to simultaneously dock to transfer ore during mining operations is a definite bonus.<br/><br/>Ships of Clement Sector 12: Broken Hill-class Prospector comes complete with beautiful views of the ship.  The prospector is presented with full deckplans and statistics to make your use of our product simple, easy and fun. In addition, the ship comes with a set of adventure hooks to get your characters right into the action as well as a short story written by Bradley Warnes.<br/><br/>In addition, Ships of Clement Sector 12: Broken Hill-class Prospector also includes the Venture-class Troop Transport.  A variation of the Broken Hill-class prospector, the Venture-class troop transport is marketed as an affordable transport vessel for small system defense forces and private security contractors (mercenaries).

The Seeress saw only blood and fire in a future of war, and worked hard to keep her King and her people on the path of peace and reason. Yet there were those who desired the chaos of war to visit Nubara.<br/><br/>These were not the Sand-Princes. It was the Cult of Tzanti, the Demon Prince of Fungus and Blight, who watched from afar and plotted Nubara's destruction. These men lived in the desert wastes of Kesh, the Land of Exiles.

It combines simple blocks with physics, which creates a new, unique gameplay experience as everything you build can be destroyed. Build awesome structures, invent machines, master different challenges or play against other players in exciting multiplayer battles - the game contains a variety of modes:<br/><br/>Singleplayer<br/><br/>The singleplayer mode contains levels of which each one features a different kind of challenge. Amongst many others, these include:<br/><br/>Tower construction: In this level, you have to build a tower of a specific height. The challenge lies in figuring out a solid enough structure so that the tower doesn't collapse while using resources effectively.<br/>    <br/>Transport: In this level, an object has to be transported from one platform to another. To achieve this, the player has to create bridges, which are strong enough.<br/>    <br/>Destroy target: In this level, the player has to invent efficient weapons (for example cannons) to destroy structures.<br/><br/>Multiplayer<br/><br/>The multiplayer part of the game is more strategy oriented and contains different game types. In all of the game types, the players have areas in which they can build things on the opposite side of the map. In order to be able to build things, you have to create producers, which produce resources. Furthermore, you have to create warehouses to store resources. All strategic blocks, including producers and warehouses consist of a podium and an object, which lies on it. If this object falls off the podium, the object loses all upgrades. Therefore, you have to build defences in order to defend you production system. Currently the game contains two multiplayer modes, which have different goals:<br/><br/><br/>Defend the crown: In this mode, the player has to defend a crown, which lies on a podium. Like described above, the player has to gain resources in order to build defences and weapons and to unlock more powerful blocks like the TNT-block or the accelerator-block.<br/>    <br/>Tower construction: In this mode, each player has to create a high enough tower. The first player, who builds such a tower and defends it for 2 minutes against attacks from the other player, wins the game.<br/><br/>Sandbox<br/><br/>In the sandbox mode you can build everything you want without limits. Sandbox maps can be saved so you don't have to worry to lose anything you've created. Currently, there is also a multiplayer sandbox in development in order to enable you to build and experiment with your friends.<br/><br/>Inventor mode<br/><br/>Since everything is created out of blocks, it might take long to build things that are more complex. The Inventor-mode enables you to create your own inventions out of bricks, which you can save and then place in singleplayer-, multiplayer- and sandbox-games like any other block. Invent a new machine, more efficient weapons or powerful defences - the better your ideas, the better are your chances of winning a multiplayer game or mastering a challenge in a singleplayer game.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "195944": {"poll": [], "name": "Awakening: The Redleaf Forest", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Boomzap Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Big Fish Games"], "description": "Queen Sophia embarks on one final journey to rescue her parents and to defeat Dreadmyre once and for all.

Their task is to send the message to the gods of Asgard to ask them for help in the war with evil forces. They can do it by either building the ships and sailing to Asgard, or by killing one of evil monsters (Trwyth), after which, they will be allowed to go through the stone forest and reach Asgard. Evil side, of course, tries to prevent it from happening, but with slick tactics, vikings are able to achieve it. And this is when the real fun begins. With the help of almost 20 gods, the good side begins an even battle.<br/><br/>The evil gods and monsters try to chase and eliminate the good gods and vikings, to prevent them from reaching Yggdrasill. the tree on which Jormungard the snake lives. If the good manage to kill it,they win. If the evil, eliminate all good ones, they win.<br/> Every character in the game has 2 traits: strength and magic power + some of them, are able to use spells. Duels are, unfortunately simple, you choose either strength or magic, roll a die and add the result to the chosen trait. The higher result denotes the winner. After the 1st wounded the character's token is flipped and remains wounded until healed (successful die roll)or attacked and wounded again, which is the end for a given character.<br/><br/>The game is played on a huge board, divided into lands. There are seas, rivers, mountains, forests and places to explore, where magic items can be found. Characters can also learn spells in magic schools.<br/><br/>There are also event cards, drawn at the beginning of a new round.<br/>The game, though simple, and rather visually not too attractive, is a lot of fun to play. Because of the size of the board and numerous charters, it is never played the same way. The good may have many possible routes to get to Yggdrasill, and the abilities (spells) of some of their mightiest gods, can change a hopeless situation.<br/>If one changed the rules of battling, made a new colorful board and substitute cardboard tokens with plastic figures, the game would be a hit.<br/><br/>"}, "195992": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Kai Bettzieche"], "poll": [], "name": "Arachne", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement", "Take That"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2959370_t.png", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2959370.png", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Fantasy", "Print & Play"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "In the dark tunnels and caves far below the surface of our world, evil creatures lurk in the shadows.<br/>Some of them, such as the cunning dark elves, have developed a civilization &ndash; and in every successful civilization games are played, so the masterminds can sharpen their wits, while the lower townsmen have their share of distraction.<br/><br/>Arachne is such a game: While you can find some elements of the chess game played by the surface dwellers, there are quite a lot of differences, too:<br/>First of all, as a devotion to the Spider Goddess, Arachne is played on the strands of a spider web.
