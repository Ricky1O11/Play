The player takes the place of an ordinary patron living in an apartment. The player starts off simply channel-surfing with a TV remote and watching short cartoons and commercials that parody real-life shows (such as Seinfeld, which is parodied as Whinefeld). One channel even has the game's chief programmer providing hints on how to play the upcoming game. Several cartoon characters either forbid or encourage the player to push the red button on their remote as the player surfs the channels. When the player pushes the button, the cartoons break out of the television set, steal the remote, and cause the entire apartment complex to go into animated form. The player must recover the television remote, which is the only thing that can zap the escaped toons and send them back to TV Land, the fictional toon world found within the depths of the television. The player searches the other apartments for the remote while playing nearly thirty games contained within them and avoiding the destructive trickery committed by the escaped toons. At the end, all the toons are back in the TV, but at the last second, Chisel grabs the player into the TV. When the player lands into the Cartoon world, the player's hand will be black and white, and will scream.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The player navigates through twenty rooms located on five floors. The basement, attic, and several hidden rooms are also accessible. There are thirty rooms to play in, but some don't appear in all of the games you play and almost none of them appear in the same place twice in a row. These rooms all have keys to them, but you have to search for them since the toons stole them all; you can also collect random items that may be useful later.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Stay Tooned!

Featured here are chit draws for activation of formations and individual unit efficiency ratings. The Axis player uses amphibious landings and airdrops to bring his units into the battle while the Allied player defends with artillery bombardment from behind heavy fortifications. Special rules include heavy tanks and dummy airdrops, and more, as found in a group of random events that players draw in order to obtain special capabilities, such as Deception Measures, Gas, Anti-tank guns, Transport, Smoke Screen, and much more. As you might expect, the game includes the highest quality OoB for both sides for each scenarios; we really dug into various national archives for this game. All scenarios stop after only a few days of campaigning as it is during this time that the battle would be decided.<br/><br/>Our hobby has perhaps a unique ability to explore the great questions of events in history. Here, what if during WWII the Axis actually invaded Malta. Who would win? The answer turns on many additional questions and circumstances. This two-player game explores several of these in three scenarios plus the bonus game covering the historical invasion of Leros.<br/><br/>Fall 1940: The Italians had big talk and many objectives during the war but not enough realistic plans. Perhaps the best time for their invasion would be in the fall, and perhaps timed along with the German invasion of Britain; or, if the Germans do not invade, then perhaps in place of the actual Italian invasion of Greece. Operational plans for Malta were poor but British defenses are weak. Perhaps the Italians could catch the British not reacting in time.<br/><br/>Spring 1941: In April 1941 the Axis had a choice, either occupy Crete or attack Malta. On April 21st Gen. Student, chief of the paratroopers, overcame opposition from the Wehrmacht Operations Staff, and others, in Berlin and persuaded Hitler to attack Crete. But, what if Hitler accepted the alternative recommendation to attack Malta? The Germans and Italians would now have to prepare for a combined operation, air, land, and sea, and do this quickly. The forces arrayed against Malta would have been huge, but the British were far better prepared than a year before and well fortified. The bloody issue would have been in doubt from the start.<br/><br/>Summer 1942: After a over year of preparation and study and agreement on the need to invade, the combined German and Italian staffs had put together an extensive and complex plan for invasion. Its success depended on many factors and lessons had been learned from the battle for Crete the year before had been put into effect. All was as ready as it could be, yet they did not invade. The British were stronger in numbers and weapons but their efficiency was down due to the long siege. Was it just Hitler&rsquo;s nervousness about such an unusual Axis operation, or was it the allure of bigger victories elsewhere?<br/><br/>November 1943, Leros: The possibility of invading Malta had passed but the British had put themselves out on a small island in the Aegean, Leros. Incredibly, a large part of the British garrison consisted of the former Malta garrison, now well rested. In effect, it was a miniature Malta. This time the Germans did not hesitate, they invaded by sea and air. This tough little infantry fight shows just what grit was involved and how the experience of fighting on Malta would have been. The British lost, but the battle was close. All the flavor of the Malta battle is here but at only one-third of the size.<br/><br/>TIME SCALE:        8 hours per turn<br/>MAP SCALE:        600 yards per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE:        Battalions and companies<br/><br/>"}, "183578": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3236903.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Lee Brimmicombe-Wood"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2017", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Rodger B.

If you cannot agree the oldest player starts.<br/><br/>You have two options:<br/>1. Turn over two cards. If as yet no player has found a pair, you can only choose this option. Turn over two cards from the center. Have you turned over two identical pieces of loot?<br/><br/>     Yes? - Great! Take the two cards and place them face down in front of you.<br/>     No? - Pity! All the players try to remember the pieces of loot. Then you turn the cards back over again.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>2. Turn over a card and inquire with another player<br/>You can only choose this option if at least one of the other players has already found a pair. Turn over a card from the center. Point to one of the two pieces of loot and say the name of the player who you think has this piece of loot represented among his cards.<br/><br/>The player in question secretly checks to see if he does.<br/><br/>     The player has the corresponding piece of loot? Great! He must to give you the corresponding card. Now you can keep both cards placed face down in front of you.<br/>     The player does not have the corresponding piece of loot? Pity! Turn over the card in the center.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Then it&rsquo;s the turn of the next player.<br/><br/>End of Round<br/><br/>A round ends as soon as there is no card left in the center. The<br/>player who collected the most cards receives a bag of loot. In case of a draw, various players receive a bag. A new round starts Now the deck of cards with the blue backside is returned to the box and a second round is played with the green cards.<br/>If you want to play more than two rounds, swap the deck of cards<br/>after each round.<br/><br/>End of the game<br/><br/>As soon as a player collects his second bag of loot, he has won the game. If various players receive a second bag at the same time, they share the victory.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual First Edition"], "name": "Extrem-Memo", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Memory", "Set Collection"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "age": "5"}, "183669": {"poll": [], "name": "Act of Aggression", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows download edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3303373.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Military", "War - Modern"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Eugen Systems"], "videogamegenre": ["Real Time Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "videogamehonor": ["2015 Global Game Awards Best Strategy Game of the Year Nominee"], "average": "6", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Focus Home Interactive"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3303373_t.jpg", "description": "Set in the near-future, Act Of Aggression is a techno-thriller real-time strategy game hailing from the Golden Era of RTS: the nineties and noughties.

It's not an election game. It begins after you've been elected. It's about sitting in The Chair and trying to advance your agenda while navigating ongoing crises, political enemies, public opinion, your relations with Congress and the press, and keeping your country secure in a world of rival nations and agendas that just seems to keep blowing up around you. Mr. President is a resource management game, where you never have enough resources to achieve your entire agenda, and the path you take through an always unpredictable storyline rests on the choices you make. Depending on the results of those choices, and on the unfolding of a &quot;different every game&quot; story, you'll either be thinking &quot;POTUS? Piece of Cake!&quot; or &quot;Why was it that I WANTED this job?&quot; many times in each game.<br/><br/>Like the actual President, you'll have an array of allies and resources to help you as you navigate both the corridors of power in the nation's capital and the uncertainties of international relations. These allies and resources will vary from game to game, but you'll always be able to rely on your Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense to help you with foreign policy and with the use, where you deem necessary, of the combat power of the U.S. military. You'll also have a bevy of domestic advisors and friends in Congress to help you navigate the many challenges in Congress and domestic life and politics. And you'll always have access to at least one truly exceptional talent (this, too, will vary from game to game), someone who excels in their particular job and is a &quot;force multiplier&quot; for you in their own unique way. How you lead and utilize this mix of talents and experience at your disposal will go a long way toward determining your success or failure during your shot at being Mr. President.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/><br/>The Map. The game map allows you to see and track the domestic and world situation that the game creates. It is divided into sections:<br/><br/>1. Congress. This is where you track progress of legislation, as well as keep track of your friends and opponents in Congress.<br/><br/>2. Advisors and Assets. This section of the map is a holding area for all of your advisors, available action points, and military assets.<br/><br/>3. Crisis Management. This is where you manage the Crisis Cards and keep track of crisis status and how well you've dealt with each crisis.<br/><br/>4. The World portion of the map (about half of the map) is divided into eight world regions, with additional sections for Russia and China (your key potential antagonists in the game). Here's a look at the South America Region, as an example of the regional displays:<br/><br/>Crisis Cards. At the heart of Mr. President are the 150+ Crisis Cards that help create the storyline for each game. These cards - see the 12 sample cards on this page - are a mix of cards representing Domestic or World Crises, Terrorism Events, Unexpected Benefits, and Opportunities. The Crisis Cards help drive, but do not completely control, the storyline in each game. Here's how it works:<br/><br/>Each game of Mr. President is divided into eight turns, each representing six months in office. These turns are further divided into six Rounds, each representing one month.<br/><br/>At the start of each turn, you get to perform assessment and planning actions, where you get to lay out your rough plan, re-examine strategy, re-evaluate the threats and opportunities that were presenting as the previous turn ended (or at game start). So there is definitely a proactive strategy piece to the game. Unfortunately, though, your plans are not often going to survive intact once the turn gets going. The world stage is a dynamic platform.<br/><br/>Once you have your plans made (and the Mr. President gods laugh at you!), you perform the six monthly rounds in order. During each round, you draw three Crisis Cards that represent that main world or domestic events that happen (these are usually bad from your point of view, but occasionally they are events or resources that help you) during that month. Most of the events on the Crisis Cards present you with both an urgent problem that may immediately alter the board state, and a longer term issue that may linger and cause you pain down the road if you don't address it well.<br/><br/>After you flip and resolve the three Crisis Cards for the round, you get to take actions, using any of your available personnel and resources. These actions allow you  to make progress on your legislative agenda, attempt to address any new crises presented by the round's three actions cards, deal with any lingering world or domestic issues, fight terrorism, perform diplomacy, and attempt to better your situation in the world or in the eyes of the American people.<br/><br/>Once you finish your action portion of the round, that round (month) is finished, and you move on to the next round, drawing three new Crisis Cards and repeating the round process until the 6-month turn is complete.<br/><br/>Seeded within the 18-card mix that makes up a turn, you have six cards for Russian and Chinese Actions, Terror Actions, War Progress, Crisis Checks, and White House Life. You know that each of these six cards will show up sometime during each turn, but you don't know when. The variable timing of these cards' appearance each turn adds uncertainty and spice to the game, while ensuring that major players in the game present challenges for you every single turn. Russia and China offer deeper challenges, with four possible postures (aggression levels) for each country and a country-specific AI for each. Postures may shift in-game in response to your actions or to storyline events, making dealing positively with each nation an evolving challenge all game.<br/><br/>Please note that Mr. President is NOT a &quot;beer and pretzels&quot; surface-level game. This game is intended to be deep and immersive, one that will both frustrate and delight the solitaire player. Playing time is four to eight hours (depending on your experience level) to play an entire 4-year term. I've tried to pack as much fun as possible into each 6-month turn, so that even if you only have time to play one turn on a weeknight, you'll be engaged, frustrated, challenged, and immersed throughout. That said, I hope you're going to find it difficult to stop playing after each turn. I've designed Mr. President to be an experience that will wrap you up in each new game's story, and beckon you back to the game table after each round, turn, or completed game.<br/><br/>I designed this game to provide massive replayability. With over 150 Crisis cards in the mix, and multiple subsystems representing the US Economy, Congress, Homeland Security, the Press, Presidential Prestige, Russia, China, Hostile Rogue States, and staunch Allies, no two games of Mr. President will ever play remotely alike. If you think you're ready for that challenge, go ahead. Raise your right hand and swear the oath. Then settle in behind the desk in the Oval Office, and let your imagination run wild!<br/><br/>I hope playing Mr. President brings you as much enjoyment as designing it has brought me!<br/><br/>- Gene<br/><br/>Components<br/><br/>22 x 34&rdquo; mounted game board<br/>165 Cards<br/>600 counters and markers      <br/>rulebook <br/>playbook<br/>six card stock player aid cards<br/>one ten-sided and two six-sided dice<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First publisher edition"], "average": "7.5", "name": "Mr. President", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Area Control / Area Influence", "Dice Rolling", "Simulation"], "age": "0", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 42 :: Board Game of the Year 2016 - Brawling Brothers Awards"]}, "183687": {"rpgartist": ["Chris Cirillo"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "New Heroes/Villains: Sparkles the Unicorn", "rpgdesigner": ["Ross Payton"], "rpgproducer": ["Ross Payton"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2658691.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Base Raiders"], "rpgpublisher": ["Slang Design"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)", "Mythology / Folklore"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2658691_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Sparkles is a legend among base raiders, both heroic and villainous.

On the one hand, they are awe-inspiring creatures of myth and fantasy, terrible draconic creatures which no human has ever lain eyes upon, stars of novels, television, and movies. On the other hand, they were real, mundane animals, not so different from the animals we know in modern day times. As a result, dinosaurs occupy a nebulous space between fantasy and reality, and require a delicate balance to handle well.<br/><br/>The dinosaurs included in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary do an excellent job of presenting one interpretation of dinosaurs: that of being large, but nonetheless mundane animals, differing from a bear or elephant only in Hit Dice and size category. Like other animals, they receive little in the way of special abilities or mechanics to make them come alive at the game table. With Weekly Wonders: Cinematic Dinosaurs Volume II, we present a different interpretation of dinosaurs, one which draws on the more fantastical elements of these creatures, as seen in movies, television, games, and more. Though they are decidedly non-magical in nature, these dinosaurs can hardly be said to be mundane, with numerous new and exciting special abilities designed to evoke the sorts of action attributed to dinosaurs in other media.<br/><br/>In this book, you will find:<br/><br/>    The primordial pteranodon (CR 5), with a deadly, razor-sharp beak, a terrifying penchant for dive-bombing, and the ability to easily carry off creatures of nearly their own size into the air, to devour at leisure at their nest<br/>    The primordial brontosaurus (CR 13), whose bulk allows it to destroy even towering structures with a gesture, and whose massive tail is a terror to behold on the field of battle.<br/>    Supplemental rules applicable to all dinosaurs and other creatures of immense size, which address the common problem of one could ever hope to kill such creatures by stabbing their toes, and providing extensive rules for climbing massive creatures, and fighting them from a precarious vantage point on the very body of one's foe.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "183689": {"rpgartist": ["Dim Martin"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Warbirds Mission Cards", "rpgdesigner": ["Ray Nolan"], "rpgproducer": ["Ray Nolan"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2658689.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Pulp)", "History (Alternative)", "War"], "rpgpublisher": ["Outrider Studios"], "rpg": ["Warbirds Role Playing Game"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2658689_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Warbirds Mission Cards offer a quick and easy way for GMs to determine their pilots&rsquo; next mission.

And so various human factions agree, for a handsome fee, to mine the Primordium for the Mirrugennin, and to battle, and when possible, gather specimens of the Raptezoids for the Mirrugennin to study.<br/><br/>It is not long before the lust for wealth sends these mining factions into conflict with one another, as they each seek to claim more and more asteroids for themselves. Ordinary space miners, most often equipped with nothing more than their trusty pick-axes, have to quickly figure out how to become soldiers as they are sent headlong into bloody battle against the armies of other mining factions. These conflicts become known as the Primoridum Wars, and rage for several years before the Mirrugennin suddenly and mysteriously disappear.<br/><br/>You will play the leader of one these human factions. You will expand your primordium mining operations throughout the asteroid field, fight the terrible Raptezoids, and wage war against your opponents. At the end of five rounds, the player with the most wealth wins the game.<br/><br/>The Primordium Wars is a quasi tile placement and resource gathering game where players place tiles representing various buildings onto their asteroids in order to increase their primordium mining operations. It is also a game in which combat plays a significant, though secondary role, where players attack each other in order to claim more resource producing asteroids, or to disrupt their opponents operations. The game takes place on a modular board where, in each round, players slowly shift the asteroids around on the game board. Because of this, very interesting things can take place, such as: A path is suddenly created leading straight to an opponent's once well protected mining hub, or two players suddenly find that their starships are now in the same sector where a massive space battle is imminent, or an opponent's dangerous class A starship is now cut off.<br/><br/>In each round, players will first acquire, in a bidding phase, tiles that represent the items needed to expand their mining empires such as various asteroid modules to be built on the asteroids (mining facilities, orbital turrets, pulse cannons, science laboratories, etc), various starship upgrades (warp drives, sniping lasers, stealth devices, etc), miner and mercenary reinforcements, build points for building new starships, and grav technology for tethering asteroids together into clusters (a core mechanism that greatly increases mining production, and expands the functionality of most modules built on the asteroids).<br/><br/>Players will then deploy their newly acquired items onto their asteroids and starships, take turns moving their pieces deeper into the asteroid field in order to expand their mining empire, fight Raptezoids and the dreaded Hive Queen, and battle other players through a diceless blind/bluff mechanism in which players that are in conflict secretly and simultaneously make, and then reveal, their battle plans. (This allows for thrilling Operation Bodyguard/Overlord type strategies where you make an opponent think you are attacking HERE, drawing out his forces, but then you really attack HERE, where he is vulnerable.)<br/><br/>Other core mechanisms: The configurations of players' starships are customizable, and kept hidden from opponents, and the more mining facilities built on any particular asteroid, the greater the chance Raptezoids will appear on that asteroid, and hence the greater the chance that they will summon their queen. This is accomplished by die rolls during the &quot;Raptezoid Phase&quot;.<br/><br/>At the end of each round players will collect their income from their mining operations and Raptezoid research, and a new round will begin.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "14", "name": "The Primordium Wars", "playingtime": "300", "boardgamemechanic": ["Modular Board", "Tile Placement"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games"]}, "183700": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2908926.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Andrea Angiolino", "Pier Giorgio Paglia"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "99", "boardgameartist": ["Vincenzo Auletta", "Dario Cal\u00ec", "Fabio Maiorana"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ares Games"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2908926_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Aviation / Flight", "Expansion for Base-game", "Miniatures", "Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>The Reggiane Re.2001 Falco II was an Italian fighter aircraft.

It is not uncommon for an Inquisitor to influence the mind of a lesser man, to open a door or portal with but a wish, even to hurl incandescent bolts of balefire at his foes. But even the most innocuous cantrip can open a pathway for possession, attracting daemons from the warp like sharks to a drowning man. The fate of those unshriven in the eyes of the Emperor is often far worse than any divised by man, as a psyker unsure of his talents can be torn inside out within the blink of an eye &ndash; his mortal soul the cost of his ignorance. Thus only the most capable and psychically gifted Inquisitors dare to use their powers on a regular basis, knowing full well that the slightest lapse in concentration could cost them, at the very least, their mind.<br/><br/>However, there are those in the galaxy in league with the very energies they seek to exploit, the Lords of Chaos; the Ruinous Powers themselves. To these foolish, corrupt or insane individuals, such dangerous knowledge comes quickly and easily. The most potent of these magi can conjure coruscating infernos with but a gesture, change their form with a word and cripple those who would harm them with a glance.

The Ordo has extensive files on each of the major Craftworlds of the Eldar, and although recorded instances of war with the Eldar far outweigh those of collaboration, the Eldar are unusual in that they have been known to fight alongside Humanity in pursuit of a common goal. Unlike aliens such as the ferocious Tyranids or implacable Necrons, Eldar can play far more of a role in a game such as Inquisitor; they are far from mindless brutes to be hunted down and killed. The Eldar likely to be encountered in Inquisitor will be warriors and outcasts, following their own agendas and no doubt deeply embroiled in the events portrayed by the tabletop game itself. This article aims to facilitate the usage of Eldar characters in Inquisitor, and covers everything from reasons to include Eldar in the storyline in the first place, to the esoteric weaponry and skills that mark them apart as the powerful and enigmatic aliens they truly are.<br/> <br/>User Summary:<br/><br/>A PDF supplement for Inquisitor covering rules for the Eldar.

But, don&rsquo;t let the simplicity fool you. Over 254 variables are used to create each team&rsquo;s chart making them highly accurate for both team performance and individual player performance. And best of all, we&rsquo;ve designed the game so that there is little to no set-up time involved. As you become comfortable with the rules, you&rsquo;ll be able to grab two team sheets, a score sheet and four dice and begin play immediately.<br/><br/>Games are resolved drive-by-drive, rather than play-by-play. But, again, don&rsquo;t let that fool you into thinking that individual contributions aren&rsquo;t important. You&rsquo;ll quickly see the impact of great rushers, passers and receivers on offense and pass rushers, cover men and big hitters on defense. So, while the game is resolved by drives, individual player contributions are the difference between winning and losing.<br/>Don&rsquo;t fret; special teams, penalties, turnovers, home field advantage, and a team&rsquo;s momentum are all captured within the game. You&rsquo;ll be amazed as you watch everything unfold on your tabletop just as it does in real life.<br/><br/>As the name of the game implies, capturing the momentum as it swings from one team to the other is a big part of the game. Our system is unique in that it doesn&rsquo;t overly dominate the game mechanics nor is it over stated.

An appendix at the end contains 38 example races in short form ready to play.<br/><br/>How is this different from all the other fan-created races?<br/><br/>Dungeons &amp; Dragons players have been using unusual races since the days of 1st edition, which had tens of magazine articles offering new races. Therefore it is unsurprising that we are seeing a lot of fan-created races for Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition (5e). Some of these look good and balanced, others are obviously over-powered, and some look fine but on deeper inspection are 'out'. This is because these races are created by using the Player's Handbook (PHB) races as a rough template in a monkey see, monkey do fashion and relying on intuition to judge whether the traits and overall result are balanced. The problem is, with a new game this past experience from other editions can be misleading and so intuition is flawed.<br/><br/>So how is this article different? In Part 2 I have analysed all the race and feat traits in the PHB, Dungeon Master's Guide (DMG), and Elemental Evil Player's Companion (EEPC) and then reverse engineered the system Wizards of the Coast uses in-house to create PC races. There may be differences in some of the relative point values presented here but otherwise this is what WOTC uses. This provides a basis beyond intuition to evaluate races and greater creative freedom than using existing races as templates. I'm confident most of the races produced by this process will be balanced.<br/><br/>How's this different from last time?<br/><br/>I have already released one article describing a method to convert monsters into PC races (RPG Review issue 25). This new article uses a simpler point-buy method. Not only is this easier but it enables you to create new races from your own imagination or recreate classic PC races from previous editions. This version also takes into account the PHB errata released in 2015.<br/><br/>"}, "183819": {"rpgdesigner": ["Istv\u00e1n Bel\u00e1nszky", "Gergely Czir\u00e1ki", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Feh\u00e9r", "D\u00e1niel Kodaj", "M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Mass\u00e1r", "Gergely N\u00e1dori", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Somlai", "Sylva Theomer", "Mikl\u00f3s Tihor", "Peter Vandaag"], "statistics": [], "name": "B\u00edborhold (Season 3, Issue 6 - Jun 1994)", "rpgartist": ["B\u00f6jthe Csaba", "Gy\u00f6rgy Csik\u00f3s", "Gergely Czir\u00e1ki", "Zs\u00f3fia Hahn", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Lipt\u00e1k", "Szabolcs M\u00e1t\u00e9fy", "Angus McBride", "Fischer Tam\u00e1s"], "rpgproducer": ["D\u00e1niel Kodaj", "M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Mass\u00e1r", "Gergely N\u00e1dori", "G\u00e1bor Szegedi", "Zsolt Szigeti", "Mikl\u00f3s Tihor"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2661257.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["B\u00edborhold"], "rpg": ["Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition)", "Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)", "Cyberpunk 2013", "T\u00fal\u00e9l\u0151k F\u00f6ldje"], "rpgpublisher": ["Budapest Business Kft."], "rpgissueversion": ["Standard Version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2661257_t.jpg", "description": "B&iacute;borhold<br/>Fantasy &eacute;s Szerepj&aacute;t&eacute;k Magazin<br/>1994 J&uacute;nius<br/>III &Eacute;vfolyam 6 Sz&aacute;m<br/><br/>"}, "183821": {"poll": [], "name": "Drug Wars: A Game Based on the New York Drug Market", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["DOS release"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Crime"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "description": "Drugwars is a turn-based strategy computer game in which the player assumes the role of a drug dealer engaged in arbitrage. The object of the game is to deal the most drugs to pay off the &quot;loan shark&quot; (who charges interest) by the end of the game and make a profit.<br/><br/>Drugwars was originally a DOS program created by John E. Dell in 1984.<br/><br/>Premise<br/><br/>The premise of the game is that the player is a drug dealer living in New York City. The player travels around the various parts such as Manhattan, The Bronx, and Brooklyn. The player also buys and sells various drugs such as Cocaine, Heroin, Acid, Weed, Speed, and Ludes. Traveling from one part of the city to another takes one day. The point of the game is to make the most amount of money in the given time of 30 days.<br/><br/>The player begins with $2,000, 100 spaces in his/her trenchcoat, and no weapons. A player must deal with loan sharks who are useful because they provide the much needed initial capital investment, but charge a high interest rate and must be paid back quickly or the player loses the game. During the course of the game, the player can buy a gun or extra pocket space by randomly being offered those things during travel. In each part of the city, the player checks the prices, buys and sells drugs, and then travels to another part of the city.<br/><br/>Other components include the police who are embodied in the character of Officer Hardass. During the game, Hardass will randomly confront the player. The player has four choices: to get arrested, to run, to fight, or to keep dealing. Any choice risks injury to the player and after 10 shots the player dies and thus loses the game. In order to fight the police, the player must have a gun. If the player can kill Hardass and his deputies, a cash award will be earned. Random occurrences also occur during the game such as muggings, drug sales, increased drug prices, and the finding of drugs.<br/><br/>After 30 days, the game ends. The final score is calculated by taking the players current amount of cash and multiplying it by two. The number of millions of dollars a player has is his/her score out of a 100. For example, a player who finishes with $25,000,000 will have a final score of 50/100. If a player reaches $50,000,000, the maximum score of 100/100 will be attained and the player will have beaten the game.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Drugwars&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "183823": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2671245.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Gunter Baars"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Joachim Krause"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2671245_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Memory"], "description": "How do crocodile babies come into the world?

The Miners are searching for resources like gold and iron on a 3D Game Board. To be more efficient they have to upgrade their shovels and pickaxes and can buy additional ropes. With negotiation skills they have to sell the mined resources on the market. <br/>The player which earns the most money wins the game.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>The special thing about Miner is its unique 3D sandbox in the middle of the game board. The sandbox includes 180 massive resource blocks. Hidden under soil there are stone, coal, iron and gold, that want to be discovered. The player steps in the role of a miner. With negotiating skill they try to sell the mined resources on the market for a good price. <br/> Each round a player has 10 hours to perform actions. Every action costs time, which is displayed on the player&rsquo;s game tableau. When there is no time left the player can knock off work and the next player begins his turn. <br/> What actions a player can choose?<br/>The key element of the game is the 3D sandbox. Inside of it every player has a game character. In the sandbox the player can move, climb or mine resources. In the beginning of the game all players are standing on soil, but the deeper they dig, the more exciting it will be.<br/><br/>But that's easier said than done. Every player starts with only one rope. So if you want to dig deeper you should better buy some additional ropes in the town. With the mined resources you can go to the market. But be careful, the prices shown by the resource dice are changing every round. When you don&rsquo;t want to sell the mined resources you have to store them in a warehouse. Every player owns a warehouse on his private deck. There are also 4 warehouses in the town available which can be rented.<br/><br/>If you want to rank among the best, you soon have to go to the forge and buy better tools. Of course some coins have to be reinvested but with better pickaxe your mining will be much more efficient.<br/><br/>If there is some time left, you can work for the day laborer to earn some coins or you can visit the tavern. In the tavern you can get some benefit cards which can really make the difference.<br/><br/>With all these actions you can plan your turn. If there is no time left you have to wait for the next round. Plan your turns clever and you will have the right resources at the right time.

Each of these thirds has its own unique flavor, both in fluff and in terms of mechanics, and such compartmentalization allows those who only bought some of the constituent thirds of Strange Magic to pick up whatever new content interests them.<br/><br/>Truename magic is all about deliberation, poise, and explicit intent. For a truenamer to attempt to recite something before its exact phrasing is known is little better than suicide. Necessarily, a truenamer's experimentation takes no chances. The ultimate end goal of First Language experimentation is not new recitations, but rather to get the universe to heed those recitations permanently. Since a recitation must be known to the most exacting degree to have any hope of influencing the universe permanently, truename magic items are among the most deliberately-made objects in the known cosmos. Chaos and uncertainty simply do not exist in the realm of the truenamer, and the seemingly-chaotic creations of a scion of discordia are, in actuality, the painstakingly-researched masterpieces of a rhetorician who knows exactly how to make her audience react however she wants.<br/><br/>Of course, it's not fair to assume that truename magic items are dull, wooden, and utilitarian simply because the research to make one that doesn't spontaneously explode is meticulous. There's just something about building something ridiculous out of universal constants that draws a very specific sort of personality, and truenamers have been one-upping each others' whimsy pieces for centuries. Whenever a tower shield transforms into a tower with a periscope, that's a truenamer's work. Whenever a club insults its target constantly, that's a truenamer's work. Whenever something that couldn't possibly come stocked with a minibar has a minibar anyway, that's a truenamer's work. Whenever a random ring, amulet, or tiara finds a way to make its creator's intellectual superiority known mere moments before atomizing its target, that's DEFINITELY a truenamer's work.<br/><br/>Contents<br/><br/>    9 armor/weapon/shield special abilities<br/>    3 specific magic weapons, including songbird - a dagger that turns enhancement bonus into a spellcasting minigame<br/>    3 specific tower shields, including the portable watchtower - a shield that takes the hits and dishes them out so you don't have to!<br/>    a new kind of wand<br/>    12 magic items with 11 additional variants, including the overlord's dogtag - a necklace that can turn just about any outsider into a bonded servant<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>To get full use out of this product, Strange Magic or Ultimate Truenaming is required.<br/><br/>"}, "183879": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Michael Speechley"], "poll": [], "name": "Traitor", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement", "Memory"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2682783_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2682783.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Bluffing", "Deduction"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Traitor is a 2-player abstract strategy game.

Using a modified version of the Shields &amp; Swords medieval battle system, it recreates one of the most famous battles of the Middle Ages.<br/><br/>Near a place called Agincourt, Henry V of England and the exhausted, disease-ridden remnants of his army took on a French force the size of which vastly outnumbered his own, and proceeded to wipe the floor with 'em. The French may have had the numbers, the knights, and the horses, but Hal had a strong defensive position and the all-important English longbow. The French sneered at the bowmen as only Frenchmen can, but like the man said, don't nock it until you've tried it.<br/><br/>Chief among the game's features is a clever, speedy, and diceless alternative to opportunity/reaction fire concepts that reflects the difficulties inherent in moving under missile fire. This results in a very tough game for the French Player. The English Player is favored to recreate the historical result, but it's not a stroll in the park.<br/><br/>Like other titles in the Shields &amp; Swords series, We Happy Few is an ideal introduction to wargaming, but with just enough grit to satisfy the seasoned counter-clipper.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Tiny Battle folio edition"], "age": "0", "name": "We Happy Few: The Battle of Agincourt", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "7.125", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": ["Shields and Swords"]}, "183943": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2664677.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Tom Russell"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Ilya Kudriashov"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Tiny Battle Publishing"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2664677_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["American Civil War", "Wargame"], "description": "Blood Before Richmond is a series of games recreating some of the Seven Days Battles fought between George B. McClellan&rsquo;s Army of the Potomac and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, under its daring new commander, Robert E. Lee. McClellan squandered a numerical advantage by demonstrating what would become a characteristic knack for turning tactical victories into strategic failures. Lee&rsquo;s ambitious battle plans were hindered by subordinates who seemed incapable of carrying them out - chief among them, oddly, the usually exemplary Stonewall Jackson. If either side had  been up to snuff, the war might have been decided in Late June 1862. Tiny Battle Publishing is proud to present this series of quick-playing, medium-complexity games about these fascinating and overlooked battles of the American Civil War, starting with Gaines's Mill.<br/><br/>Our first game in the series focuses on the only Confederate victory of the Seven Days. Despite the atypical outcome, it ticks off all the boxes on your Seven Days Bingo Card (just like the dice, it&rsquo;s not included). Lee&rsquo;s ambitious battle plan was abandoned late in the day for piecemeal frontal assaults on well-entrenched Union defensive positions. Jackson twiddled his thumbs for most of the battle, only appearing when Lee met with him personally to coordinate a final all-out assault. This managed to break the Union line, which might have held had the paranoid McClellan not held back vital reinforcements until the last possible moment.<br/><br/>A modified 2d6 die roll determines which Confederate divisions activate on a given turn. Divisions that didn't pull their weight are less likely to show up than those that did most of the fighting. It's a simple, clever, and elegant way to recreate the difficulties that Lee had during the Seven Days, and it creates the frustrating and tantalizing possibility that Jackson could do something if he'd only show up.<br/><br/>Blood Before Richmond builds on the same &quot;stacks of steps&quot; combat system introduced in Tom Russell's Blood on the Alma (2012). Flipping a counter over when you take a hit just doesn't capture the feel of bloody infantry collisions or the horrifying impact of artillery fire. This system uses step counters stacked beneath an identifying counter to account for brutal attrition and devastating wipe-outs.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Tiny Battle folio edition"], "age": "0", "name": "Blood Before Richmond: Gaines's Mill", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "7.1", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": ["Blood Before Richmond: Battles of the Seven Days"]}, "183944": {"rpgartist": ["Doug Anderson", "Gergely Czir\u00e1ki", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Fejes", "Korn\u00e9l R\u00e1tkai", "Fischer Tam\u00e1s"], "statistics": [], "name": "Holdt\u00f6lte (Issue 26 - Jan 1995)", "rpgdesigner": ["Andr\u00e1s Bogn\u00e1r", "J\u00e1nos Botos", "Gergely Czuppon", "K\u00e1lm\u00e1n D\u00f6rnyei", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Feh\u00e9r", "Mikl\u00f3s Hajma", "Oliv\u00e9r Kov\u00e1cs", "L\u00e1szlo P\u00e1lfalvi", "Ferenc Soml\u00f3i", "G\u00e1bor Szegedi", "Mikl\u00f3s Tihor"], "rpgproducer": ["Gy\u014drgy Endre B\u00e1tori", "D\u00e1niel Kodaj", "Gergely N\u00e1dori", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Prekop", "G\u00e1bor Szegedi", "S\u00e1ndor Szigeti", "Mikl\u00f3s Tihor"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2664062.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Holdt\u00f6lte"], "rpg": ["Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition)", "Armageddon 2092 - Mars", "Classic Battletech Role Playing Game", "Cyberpunk 2013", "T\u00fal\u00e9l\u0151k F\u00f6ldje"], "rpgpublisher": ["Budapest Business Kft."], "rpgissueversion": ["Standard Edition"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2664062_t.jpg", "description": "Holdt&ouml;lte 26<br/>Fantasy &eacute;s Szerepj&aacute;t&eacute;k Magazin<br/>1995 Janu&aacute;r<br/>IV &Eacute;vfolyam 1 Sz&aacute;m<br/><br/>"}, "183945": {"rpgdesigner": ["Andr\u00e1s Bogn\u00e1r", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Feh\u00e9r", "Lionel Green", "D\u00e1niel Kodaj", "Gergely N\u00e1dori", "S\u00e1ndor Szigeti", "Sylva Theomer", "Mikl\u00f3s Tihor"], "statistics": [], "name": "Holdt\u00f6lte (Issue 27 - Feb 1995)", "rpgartist": ["B\u00f6jthe Csaba", "Gergely Czir\u00e1ki", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Fejes", "Korn\u00e9l R\u00e1tkai", "Fischer Tam\u00e1s"], "rpgproducer": ["Gy\u014drgy Endre B\u00e1tori", "D\u00e1niel Kodaj", "Gergely N\u00e1dori", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Prekop", "G\u00e1bor Szegedi", "S\u00e1ndor Szigeti", "Mikl\u00f3s Tihor"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2664064.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Holdt\u00f6lte"], "rpg": ["Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition)", "Classic Battletech Role Playing Game", "Earthdawn (1st Edition)", "Mage: The Ascension", "Shadowrun (1st Edition)", "T\u00fal\u00e9l\u0151k F\u00f6ldje", "Vampire: The Masquerade", "Werewolf: The Apocalypse"], "rpgpublisher": ["Budapest Business Kft."], "rpgissueversion": ["Standard Edition"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2664064_t.jpg", "description": "Holdt&ouml;lte 27<br/>Fantasy &eacute;s Szerepj&aacute;t&eacute;k Magazin<br/>1995 Febru&aacute;r<br/>IV &Eacute;vfolyam 2 Sz&aacute;m<br/><br/>"}, "183947": {"rpgartist": ["Eric David Anderson", "Christopher De La Rosa", "Elizabeth Hessom", "Brian MacElvaine", "Ivan Van Norman", "Tiffany Warch"], "rpg": ["Outbreak: Undead (2nd Edition)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Outbreak: Undead (2nd Edition)", "rpgdesigner": ["Christopher De La Rosa", "Michael Goldrich", "Brett Lynam", "Tino Marquez", "Ivan Van Norman"], "rpgproducer": ["Christopher De La Rosa", "Jean Goldrich"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2668759.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Horror (Zombies)", "Modern"], "rpgpublisher": ["Hunters Books"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2668759_t.jpg", "description": "Outbreak: Undead<br/>Zombie Survival Role Playing Game<br/>Second Edition Rulebook - Pocket Edition<br/><br/>From the book:<br/><br/>In this game, one player takes the role of the Gamemaster (GM), who runs the elements of the scenario.

There are also a few special wind tiles. The game is for 2-4 players, who will evenly split the tiles. You win by being the first player to play all of your tiles.<br/><br/>The first player selects one tile from their rack and places it in the center square on the board. The next player, and then each in turn, can add one tile to the board, but that tile must be set adjacent to one or more existing tiles, and it must match each adjacent tile based on either color or shape. If you match more than one tile, or you place your tile on one of the sun squares on the board, you get stones that can be traded in for extra moves, allowing you to get rid of your tiles faster. You can also use the special wind tiles to move a tile already on the board over by one square.<br/><br/>As you play Latice, you&rsquo;ll learn to plan your turns and extra moves ahead of time. You&rsquo;ll strategically use wind tiles to alter the layout of the board, and play both offensively and defensively based on your knowledge of the remaining tiles. Latice has no language, culture, age or gender barriers and can be played by just about anyone.

To win the player must avoid to identify himself with a faction such as North America, the Soviet Union or the Middle East. These factions should be &quot;puppets&quot; that the player must maneuver to get richer than other players.<br/><br/>During a play of The Game players manage governments, banks, religious congregation and mass-media, creating conflicts, speculations, war debts and political scandals. These events can decree the well-being or the failure of the world factions, provoking wars, truces and weapons trade. It doesn't matter if the factions controlled by the player prosper or suffer: the winner will be the player who benefits the more from the world situation: when you sell weapons you can win even losing the war.<br/><br/>Some notes regarding actual game mechanics, actions and win conditions.<br/><br/>There are six factions: Europe (black), USA (blue), Sovietic Area (red), Chinese Area (yellow), Arabian area (green) and Third World area (white). Players are not associated to factions but they control them. From this point of view the game paradigma remembers Imperial.<br/><br/>The game is played in turns. During each turn a player draw one card from the common deck, then can play one card from his hand. Other players could play also a card during current player's turn, but this is not mandatory and not often worthy. Part of the strategy relies on the decision about if, when and what to play during the turn of another player. Aside from the card, each money holds some money, which can be spend during the game and it's considered as victory points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The deck contains 72 cards. 24 cards are named &quot;Controls&quot; and are permanent cards, i.e. they remain on the table after being played. The other 48 cards are temporary cards, i.e they are discarded after their effect took place. All cards are of four types: Military Control, Economic Control, Mass-Media Control and Religious Control. Since we have 6 factions and 4 type of control cards, this makes up the 24 control cards. The other 48 cards are also divided into these 4 categories (Military, Economic, Mass-Media and Religious) but, as stated above, they are temporary.<br/><br/>After playing a card, and carried on its effects (if not permanent) the current player can activate all his permanent cards. Each card allow differect actions.<br/>A military control card allows to move military units on the map, triggering wars and occupations among the 6 factions. Economic control cards allow to directly attack another player (not a faction) by stealing his money. Mass-Media control cards allows to move tokens from any position, changing the &quot;meaning&quot; of the token. This is probably the most innovative game concept: by activate a Mass-Media control a player can take a token from a Military card (depicting a was loss) and move it to a Economic card (depicting a return of investment). By this mechanism the player can use the power of Mass-Media to change the way facts are explained to people, and then changing the way the history events affects social groups. Finally, Religious control allows to steal a control card from another player: this is probably the most powerful card, but it's not always easy to manage.<br/><br/>Player roll dice only when manipulating factions. Factions are not balanced, and this is the game's core logic. For instance, a player controlling blue Military Control (USA Military control), white Economic Control (Third World control) and red Mass-Media Control (Sovietic Mass-Media Control) could decide to trigger a war between USA and Sud Africa, being almost sure that USA military forces will win easily. This could create a debt to his white Economic control card, and then he could use his red Mass-Media control to move this tokens away from white Economic card to another card of his own. An historical lecture of these strategy could be read as follows: in the real history USA won a war against Sud Africa, but russian Mass-Media managed to tell another version of facts, and this could produce a money income for the player controlling russians Mass-Media enterprises.<br/><br/>Playing The Game should give players the same feeling you can get by movies as &quot;Wag the Dog&quot; (1997) or from the historical events as the attack to the World Trade Center (2001). Players should manipulate factions, sometime carrying them to financial crises, war or destruction, in order to enrich themself (and not the faction). The game ends when a player reaches the victory condition or the deck runs out of cards. At the end of the game the richest player is the winner.<br/><br/>"}, "183978": {"rpgdesigner": ["Dan Callahan", "Curtis Rickman", "Paul Santiago", "Bradley Warnes", "John Watts", "Vaughn Wright"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "21 Plots Go Forth", "rpgartist": ["Bradley Warnes"], "rpgproducer": ["Curtis Rickman"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2666115.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Clement Sector"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction"], "rpgpublisher": ["Gypsy Knights Games"], "rpg": ["Traveller (Mongoose)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["21 Plots", "21 Series"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2666115_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Coming up with a new adventure can be a challenging process and sometimes a Referee needs a helping hand.
