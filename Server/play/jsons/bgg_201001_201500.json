If the monster is still alive, you roll to see what attack it makes on your character.  Your character and monster fight until one of you dies.  If your character survives the fight, he or she gains one or more souls (VPs) and a number of coins (for spending at The Shop).  If your character does not survive, well ... we hope you have collected some souls so you can return to the game!

The box and rules for the original game by Topeka, Kansas-based entrepreneur Harry E. Gavitt say it was covered by four copyrights and multiple patents dating as early as Sept. 15, 1896.<br/><br/>The only thing it has in common with the Pit game developed by Edgar Cayce and first sold in 1904 is the open-outcry method for trading cards and the objective of being the first to collect a complete set.<br/><br/>G-S-E, as it is also called on the box, is themed as a railway stock trading game rather than a commodities pit, and has a deck of only 49 cards: 8 shares in six railways plus a &quot;Fatal Telegram&quot; card. This compares with decks of 65 and 74 in Pit games. Similarly, G-S-E allows players to trade only one or two cards at a time, compared with a maximum of four for Pit.<br/><br/>The play of the Telegram card is very different from the Bull and Bear cards used in Pit. It always starts with the dealer, and is added to the first trade that player makes. In other words, if the dealer trades two cards for two cards, the other player receives two plus the Telegram. That player in turn must include the Telegram in his next trade and so on. The Telegram has no benefit and at hand's end equals a penalty of $100 if held by the winner and $150 if held by anyone else.<br/><br/>Scoring also differs from the later Pit. Railway shares are worth between $125 and $250 (a narrow range than in Pit). The player who first corners a railway must shout &quot;Topeka&quot; in honor of Gavitt's hometown, and scores double the value of his 8 rail cards. The other players, however, also score, each collecting the face value of his largest set. First player to $2,500 wins the game.<br/><br/>Gavitt was determined to foster boisterous play, and his rules specify that bids must be made at least twice as loud as normal conversation, and that players must make their first offers as soon as they pick up their cards, and another every five seconds thereafter. Breaking these rules carries a penalty of $25 for each offense!<br/><br/>"}, "201148": {"rpgartist": ["Joe Singleton"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Count Hephaestus", "rpgdesigner": ["Doug Taylor"], "rpgproducer": ["Dominique Sumner"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3040389.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Hazard Studio", "New Millennium Games (I)"], "rpg": ["SUPERS!

And so Prospero sets a court to answer that question.<br/><br/>In the main part of the game, the characters take turns framing scenes from Shakespeares life. Through the scenes they highlight what has been important for him in his life. The scenes are organised in five acts...The scenes are not intended to be played chronologically. The characters have free rein to set the scenes they want, though you should endeavor to ensure that you play a scene from the first act before someone frames a scene from the second act, etc. Players should choose scenes based on what they feel would fit into the story at a given point.<br/><br/>When Prospero judges that the story is reaching its conclusion, he frames the epilogue. In it, Prospero tells Shakespeare that it is time for him to leave the mortal realm. Thus, he should choose one of the characters to lead him into the world of spirits. When Shakespeare has chosen, everybody leaves the stage in procession.

In the first act what's normal is established, as are the main characters and their issues. In the beginning of the second act disaster strikes, and in the course of the act the consequences escalate while most people carry on as if nothing had happened &ndash; the ship is crash free after all. In the third act it's obvious that the ship is going to crash, and that anyone who doesn't secure a place in the life balloons will die.<br/><br/>Language and aesthetics make up the point of departure, partly in the form of what images of the concepts &rdquo;elves&rdquo; and &rdquo;goblins&rdquo; we all have in our heads, partly in the form of concrete rules governing how the players can speak of elves and goblins. Elves are valued and goblins devalued &ndash; even though it's established from the beginning that they're really not that different. The language rules are the only &rdquo;hard&rdquo; rules of the game, which focuses on dilemmas and relationships rather than  mechanical/practical problem solving.<br/><br/>The story revolves around the dynamics of two couples of primary characters, each couple containing one elf and one goblin, and one person who has the material power while the other has power of a more psychological nature. The two couples have more or less parallel storylines that share the airship and the accident as setting and might cross each other, but won't necessarily be tightly interwoven. The players take part in the &rdquo;other&rdquo; story through description and player controlled secondary characters. At first everyone pursues their own immediate goals, perhaps with help from their partners, perhaps secretly. When disaster strikes, it gradually pulls the rug out from under their individual narratives as they themselves see and act on them, eventually stripping away the complexity and individuality until only hard questions of power, life and death remain.<br/><br/>"}, "201229": {"rpgdesigner": ["Edward Q.

Humanity&rsquo;s only hope are an elite strike force of galactic super soldiers who fortuitously managed to escape on a prototype spaceship that can travel back in time by 28 days. Turning back the clock with no idea as to who the assailants were/are/will be, they do the sensible thing and decide to kill all hostile alien races to make sure.<br/><br/>Go solo or team up with up to three friends for intense roguelike planet-crawling action. Choose from four distinct characters each with their own play-style, weapons and abilities.

With online and local co-op multiplayer for up to four friends or strangers, you too can experience the intensity of group slugging.<br/>    Die, Upgrade, Repeat : each time you die, the ship will jump back in time and you can start over. Only this time, you&rsquo;re that little bit tougher, a little bit quicker. Maybe you learnt a new skill, maybe you found some blueprints to a new weapon. With an infinite amount of time at your disposal even a punk like you could become the ultimate slugger. Funny how each time you jump back things are a little bit different though. Probably shouldn&rsquo;t have chosen butterflies as the ship pet.<br/>    Four flavours of fatality: The Sluggers sure are four unique individuals. Each has a set of weapons that only they can use and abilities that only they are allowed to learn. The reasons for this are on a strictly need-to-know basis. Hey, this is a top secret military unit we&rsquo;re talking about here, civilian; we told you about the time travel thing, what more do you want?<br/>    Mysterious item shop merchant of unknown motivation: all the best games have them and this is no exception. Loot credits from the corpses of the alien scum you&rsquo;ve slaughtered and give them to a strange hooded man to get cool gear like bullets that freeze enemies or boots that make you walk super fast. Alternatively, forego immediate gratification and invest in the merchant to unlock even cooler stuff for your future past self to purchase.<br/>    Some of the best weapons we could think of: how does a dysfunctional crew of borderline psychopaths save the galaxy from a never-ending horde of bugged out aliens? Because someone gave them ridiculously overpowered weapons and abilities such as calling down an airstrike inside an underground cavern of course.

The Journal allows some of this material to be brought to light, more thoroughly covering the fascinating 1914 time period. The centerpiece of the publication is a collection of three well-researched historical articles that are paired with new scenarios allowing the subject to be accurately simulated.<br/><br/>The time period October&ndash;November 1914 contained two distinct campaigns that culminated in very large battles fought in Russian Poland: The Battle of Ivangorod and Battles of Lodz and Krakau. These battles are the topics chosen for two of the scenarios found in the journal. The first, &ldquo;The Battle of Ivangorod,&rdquo; is a small introductory scenario that covers the time period 22&ndash;26 October when the Austro-Hungarian First Army unsuccessfully fought to clear the Russians from their Vistula River bridgeheads at Ivangorod and Kozienice.<br/><br/>Following the Battle of Ivangorod, in early November the German high command acted to regain the operational initiative and protect Germany from the ravages of invasion. Using their excellent railroad network to transfer large bodies of troops, they launched an offensive to penetrate deep into the main Russian forces&rsquo; flank and rear. The epic operation is the subject of the Journal&rsquo;s second scenario, &ldquo;The Battles of Lodz and Krakau.&rdquo; This expert scenario, intended for veteran players, is huge, requiring all five maps and almost the entire counter mix.<br/><br/>A well known military axiom states: mistakes made in the deployment of troops at the start of operations cannot be righted in the course of the whole campaign. At the outset of WWI this was true for all fronts but nowhere was it more pertinent than on the Eastern Front. The Journal&rsquo;s third article, &ldquo;Austria-Hungary&rsquo;s Botched Deployment in 1914&rdquo; concentrates on that nation&rsquo;s botched initial strategic deployment.<br/><br/>The game strategy article Playing Both Sides in Galicia details successful opening moves on the Galician front. Based on years of gameplay experience by the designer, the article presents a corps-by-corps breakdown of Austro-Hungarian and Russian armies and offers tested solutions for the challenges they face.<br/><br/>Rounding out the contents are two enhanced, professionally-produced Player Aid Cards designed to speed combat resolution in 1914, Twilight in the East.<br/><br/>Journal Contents:<br/>Austria-Hungary&rsquo;s Botched Deployment in 1914.<br/>Associated scenario: The Austro-Hunarian Deployment Plan as of Winter 1913/14<br/><br/>Prelude to Ivangorod<br/>Associated scenario: The Battle of Ivangorod<br/><br/>The Lodz Campaign: Defeating the Russian Steamroller<br/>Associated scenario: The Battles of Lodz &amp; Krakau<br/><br/>Playing Both Sides in Galicia &mdash; Galicia Campaign Strategies<br/><br/>The Austro-Hungarian Army and National Identity 1867&ndash;1914<br/><br/>The Polish Legion in 1914<br/><br/>Revised Victory Conditions for the Grand Campaign scenario<br/><br/>Also included: Two replacement Player Aid Cards for 1914, Twilight in the East<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "1914: Dispatches Oregon ConSim Journal", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "8", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": ["1914  series"]}, "201305": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3043516.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Paul Peterson"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "6", "age": "8", "boardgamepublisher": ["Calliope Games"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3043516_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "40", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Dice"], "description": "Get ready to embark on the craziest vacation ever!

The players are controlling a SWAT team attempting to bring a hostage situation to a successful resolution. The game uses resource management, press-your-luck, and grid-based combat mechanics. Six situation variables allow for the game to have a high replay value. Players must work together to use the time that is given to them by the Hostage Negotiator to purchase Team members and equipment, gather intelligence on the situation, and prepare a rescue plan. The longer players wait, the better equipment and personnel they will have, but the more chances that negotiations will go south. Once players choose to rescue the hostages, grid-based combat begins that resolves in about 15 minutes.<br/><br/>The game is based on a hostage situation inside a bank. The situation cards are unknown at the beginning of the game (Hostage and Suspect #, Hostage and Suspect Positions, Equipment and, Motivation) Each game begins with an Arrival Situation that determines how much Time the players begin the game, and whether or not someone is injured and needs immediate rescue. In a multi-player game, one player is the Incident Commander and the other players control dedicated sides of the building.<br/><br/>The first phase of the game is the Containment Phase. A round begins with the Incident Commander rolling a die to simulate negotiations. The result of the roll is how much Time the negotiator has &quot;bought&quot; for the other players. Each player then begins their turn buy using their Time to buy SWAT personnel from the stack to their staging area, moving SWAT from their staging area to the board, purchasing equipment, using SWAT personnel skills, moving, or gathering intelligence. Players can buy everything from a Medic to the Bomb Squad (once revealed) and Flash Bangs to Plastic Explosives. If players begin their turn with no Time, A card is drawn that has a negative effect for that player or the entire team to simulate the suspects doing something. Certain actions require the player to draw a reaction from the suspects that range from a gunshot heard inside with an unknown result to a hostage crawling out the window.<br/><br/>At any time, or when the team is ready, the Incident Commander may initiate the Rescue Phase. All players move their squads to their breach points (windows/doors), breach doors and determine amount of surprise, reveal any unknown information, Snipers then shoot, Squads begin movement, squads then mark their shots simultaneously, once all shots are marked the shots are taken. Repeat the Snipers to shooting steps until surprise is over and then the suspects react by moving, shooting or surrendering until all the suspects have been neutralized or arrested.<br/><br/>A quick-play version is comprised of scenarios that tell the players how to set up SWAT team members, equipment, and scenario cards. The players then skip the first phase of the game and go straight to the second phase, the Rescue Phase, to attempt to rescue the hostages. All scenarios can be played at various levels of difficulty by adding or subtracting equipment items that give the players bonuses.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "13", "name": "SWAT Command", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Press Your Luck"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "201331": {"poll": [], "name": "Walking with Dinosaurs: The 3D Movie", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Press Your Luck", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Giochi Preziosi"], "boardgameversion": ["Greek first edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Children's Game", "Dice", "Environmental", "Racing"], "age": "4", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Walking with dinosaurs is a childrens' game that 2-4 players try to create their dinosaur, that comes in 4 parts, and be the first to the finish line.

And there are now leaders that have some special capabilities in the areas of handling infantry, cavalry, or artillery.<br/><br/>There are 7 scenarios included in this game and 3 of them are on the smaller side in terms of unit density.<br/><br/>These games feature the final map artwork of Rick Barber.<br/><br/>In this box are:<br/><br/>(20) 11x17 Full Color Map Sheets<br/>(7) 11x17 Scenario Cards<br/>Approximately 2600 Unit and Marker Counters<br/>Incredible Courage 100 Days &ndash; Ligny Rules Supplement<br/><br/>"}, "201334": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Reader Contribution)", "Matthew Pauze"], "statistics": [], "name": "Warlock's Journal (Issue 2 - Nov 2013)", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["Phil Nicholls"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3269301.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Warlock's Journal"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgpublisher": ["Tales of a GM"], "rpgissueversion": ["HTML Version", "Revised PDF Version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3269301_t.jpg", "description": "Warlock's Journal<br/>Issue 2<br/>November 2013<br/><br/>Storm &amp; Shield: Prime &amp; Nemesis<br/><br/>"}, "201335": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Reader Contribution)", "Vicentes Cartas Espinels", "Marques Jordan"], "statistics": [], "name": "Warlock's Journal (Issue 7 - Apr 2014)", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["Phil Nicholls"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3107452.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Warlock's Journal"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "Tales of a GM"], "rpgissueversion": ["HTML Version", "PDF Version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3107452_t.jpg", "description": "Warlock's Journal<br/>Issue 7<br/>April 2014<br/><br/>Storm &amp; Shield: Bricks &amp; Mortar<br/><br/>"}, "201336": {"poll": [], "name": "Atari Flashback Classics: Volume 1", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American PlayStation 4 edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Minigame Compilation"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Atari, Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Classic Games"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 4"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Atari, Inc."], "videogamecompilation": ["Adventure (Atari)", "Asteroids", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Atari Video Cube", "Breakout", "Casino", "Checkers", "Crystal Castles", "Demons to Diamonds", "Double Dunk", "Flag Capture", "Golf (1984)", "Gravitar", "Hangman", "Haunted House (Atari)", "Indy 500", "Major Havoc", "Maze Craze", "Microchess", "Missile Command", "Night Driver", "Off The Wall", "Outlaw", "RealSports Tennis", "Red Baron (1990)", "Secret Quest", "Sky Diver", "Spacewar!", "Starship 1", "Stellar Track", "Street Racer", "Submarine Commander (Atari 2600)", "Super Breakout", "Surround", "Video Pinball", "World Championship Soccer"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A collection of old Atari games.<br/><br/>"}, "201337": {"poll": [], "name": "Atari Flashback Classics: Volume 2", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American PlayStation 4 edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Minigame Compilation"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Atari, Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Classic Games"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 4"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Atari, Inc."], "videogamecompilation": ["Air Sea Battle", "Backgammon", "Basketball (Atari 2600 & 8-bit)", "Black Widow", "Bowling", "Brain Games", "Canyon Bomber", "Centipede (1980)", "Circus", "Combat", "Desert Falcon", "Dodge 'em", "Fatal Run", "Football", "Human Cannonball", "Liberator", "Lunar Lander", "Millipede", "Pong", "Quadrun", "Radar Lock", "RealSports Boxing", "RealSports Football", "RealSports Soccer", "RealSports Volleyball", "Slot Machine", "Slot Racers", "Space Duel", "Sprintmaster", "Star Raiders", "Steeplechase", "Stunt Cycle", "Super Baseball", "Super Football", "Tempest", "Video Olympics", "Warlords", "Yars' Revenge"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A collection of old Atari games.<br/><br/>"}, "201338": {"poll": [], "name": "The Game of Traits", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Recognition", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3044577_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Wilder Mfg."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3044577.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Deduction"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "This early-1930s game from Wilder Manufacturing Co. of St. Louis hearkens back to the Victorian era with its focus on moral rectitude. The game consists of a deck of 48 cars, 24 of which illustrate Faults and 24 illustrate matching Virtues. There also are four cards with a list of all the Faults and the Virtues that cancel their effects, and a set of four wooden racks.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt six blue-backed Faults and six red-backed Virtues. He puts his Faults upright in the racks facing away from him, so that others can see his Faults but he cannot. By looking at his opponents' Faults, a player must work out which Faults he has, and on his turn puts a Virtue from his hand on the table that will match one of his Faults.  If this Fault is in his rack, it is removed and discarded along with the Virtue from his hand.<br/><br/>If a player feels that he does not have a needed Virtue in his hand, he may draw a card from the player on his right. If it matches one of his Faults, he discards both cards. If not, he must take one of the Faults from that player as a penalty. The first player to dispose of all his Faults wins the game.<br/><br/>"}, "201339": {"rpgdesigner": ["Wolfgang Baur", "Tim W.

And there is an expansion that has Dragons, Princesses, and Witches, adding more excitement to the game.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306f\u76d7\u8cca\u56e3\u306e\u89aa\u5206\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u304c\u96c7\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u76d7\u8cca\u3067\u767a\u6398\u3055\u308c\u305f\u5b9d\u3092\u76d7\u307f\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u76d7\u8cca\u56e3\u3092\u5f37\u304f\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u76d7\u3093\u3060\u5b9d\u3067\u76d7\u8cca\u3092\u96c7\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u52dd\u5229\u8005\u306f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u7d42\u4e86\u6642\u306b\u5b9d\u3092\u591a\u304f\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u3067\u3059\u3002<br/>\u767a\u6398\u5834\u6240\u3067\u306f\u6bce\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\uff11\u3064\u305a\u3064\u5b9d\u304c\u767a\u6398\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002\u305d\u306e\u4fa1\u5024\u306f\uff11\u301c\uff11\uff10\u70b9\u306e\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\u3067\u3059\u3002<br/>\u5b9d\u3092\u898b\u305f\u5404\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306f\u76d7\u8cca\u30921\u4eba\u9078\u3073\u3001\u540c\u6642\u306b\u516c\u958b\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u767a\u6398\u5834\u6240\u3068\u76d7\u8cca\u306f\u305d\u308c\u305e\u308c4\u8272\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u76d7\u8cca\u306f\u81ea\u5206\u3068\u540c\u3058\u8272\u306e\u767a\u6398\u5834\u6240\u306e\u5b9d\u3092\u76d7\u307f\u306b\u5165\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u51fa\u6765\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u540c\u3058\u767a\u6398\u5834\u6240\u306b\u76d7\u8cca\u304c\u96c6\u307e\u3063\u305f\u5834\u5408\u3001\u4ea4\u6e09\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u5b9d\u3092\u5206\u914d\u3059\u308b\u4e8b\u304c\u51fa\u6765\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u3082\u3057\u304f\u306f\u3001\u6226\u4e89\u3057\u3066\u52dd\u3064\u4e8b\u3067\u3001\u5168\u3066\u306e\u5b9d\u3092\u5165\u624b\u51fa\u6765\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u767a\u6398\u5834\u6240\u306b\u6b8b\u3055\u308c\u305f\u5b9d\u306f\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\u30fc\u30aa\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306f\u30d2\u30fc\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u57fa\u672c\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u306f\u9a0e\u58eb\u3001\u30b4\u30fc\u30ec\u30e0\u304c\u542b\u307e\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3055\u3089\u306b\u3001\u62e1\u5f35\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u3001\u59eb\u3001\u9b54\u5973\u3001\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3057\u66f4\u306b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u76db\u308a\u4e0a\u304c\u308a\u307e\u3059\uff01<br/><br/>"}, "201453": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Francis Madeira"], "poll": [], "name": "Hip Hops", "playingtime": "25", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "17", "boardgamefamily": ["Beer", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3049280_t.jpg", "average": "5.40588", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The Polyhedron Collider Cast - UK Games Expo 2016"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3049280.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "25", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Hip Hops is the collectible beer card game that is fast and easy to learn.

Players will need to command armies of giants as they wage war throughout northwest Faer&ucirc;n. Order your giants to assault small folk villages and cities to score points and secure resources including food, artifacts, ore, and runes.<br/><br/>Each player issues commands to his or her giants in the form of command cards (recruit, move, attack, pillage, and so on). This allows players to recruit new giants, send them out to attack settlements and other giants, and also to pursue special agendas based upon their race. Each player represents a different giant race (hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, or storm giants), each with a different agenda.  For example, the Storm Giants seek to restore their lost monarch, King Hekaton. The Cloud Giants seek an ancient dragon treasure trove, and the Hill Giants seek an abundance of food with which to feed their massive monarch, Chief Guh.<br/><br/>Contents include 12 Giants miniatures, injection molded in color, measuring from approximately 60mm to over 90mm in height, and three Giantslayers.<br/><br/>Preliminary FAQ: <a target='_blank' href='https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1730050/assault-giants-preliminary-faq' rel='nofollow'>https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1730050/assault-giants-prel...</a><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["English premium edition", "English standard edition"], "name": "Assault of the Giants", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Trading", "Variable Player Powers"], "average": "7.17143", "usersrated": "154", "boardgamefamily": ["Dungeons & Dragons"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 36 - Kingmaking: Real or Imagined Problem?", "RDTN Episode 116: Assault of the Giants, Jump Drive, Moons and Chit Chat", "SC 002 Interview: Dungeon Alliance with Andrew Parks"]}, "201456": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Giuseppe Di Giovanni", "Fabrizio Mattei"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Hero Lab", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Betting/Wagering"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3049455_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Carlo Lauro", "Roberto Megna"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Beatmonkey srls"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3049455.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Party Game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "This game requires good skills!<br/><br/>Every player in his turn play as a mad scientist who'll try to create some heroes by a mix of potions while the other players will try to steal them creating the best super heroes team.<br/><br/>The Scientest player is the master who has got in his hand some cards to mix in groups of three cards matching with the three components useful to realize every Super Hero.<br/><br/>Some component cards are covered and other ones are discovered, so everybody can use the discovered informations to understand if the superhero has been created or not.<br/><br/>The Master must realize more super hero as possible for receiving award to delete his malus at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Every other player must block (with the hand), before the other players, the super heroes realized, receiving victory points.<br/><br/>If you block a not realized super hero you'll receive the same points as malus.<br/><br/>The winner is the player with more victory points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>"}, "201457": {"boardgamedesigner": ["a-tan-pic (a\u305f\u3093)", "Mabrus", "Uwan (\u3046\u308f\u3093)"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Hyakumannin Shinda Busho", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Hand Management", "Take That", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["a-tan-pic (a\u305f\u3093)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ashita Ganbarure (\u660e\u65e5\u304c\u3093\u3070\u308b\u308c)"], "boardgameversion": ["Japanese first edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Humor", "Print & Play"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "User summary<br/>100\u4e07\u4eba\u6b7b\u3093\u3060\u90e8\u7f72 (Hyakumannin Shinda Busho) in English would be &quot;The Department That Claimed a Million Lives&quot;.

When a player finishes all their jobs, her working time runs out and everyone else has to work over-time to finish their remaining jobs by themselves. Add up the face values of cards in their hand, and that's the over-time hours this week.<br/><br/>If a player's total over-time exceeds 300 hours, that player suffers Karoshi (death from overwork) and loses the game.

Players take the roles of regular folks much like themselves, who are inexorably drawn into confrontation with the creatures of the Outer Dark, an unearthly realm of alien menace. With or without its distinctive mythology, GMs can use it to replicate the shudders and shocks of the horror genre in both film and literature.<br/>Fear Itself serves as an ideal platform for one-shot games, in which, like any self-respecting horror flick, few, if any, of the protagonists are expected to survive the climax. It can also be employed to run ongoing campaigns in which the leading characters gradually discover more about the disturbing supernatural reality hiding in the shadows of the ordinary world. Over time, they grow more adept at combating them&mdash;or spiral tragically into insanity and death.<br/>This expanded edition explains how to adjust both the game rules and the assumptions of Gamemasters and players to different styles of game, from bloody one-shots to extended investigative games. Revised rules update Fear Itself with ten years of GUMSHOE development and play experience.<br/>Included are three sample scenarios:<br/>The Circle: in this one-shot, the players take on the roles of participants in an experimental drug trial. When one of their group disappears, they must investigate what happened to him &ndash; before the same horrific fate consumes them, too!<br/>The Ocean Game: Play the Ocean Game, and find meaning in your life. Play the Ocean Game, and win eternity. Play the Ocean Game, and drown in it. In this miniseries, the players participate in a cryptic contest run by a Mystery Man. The prize is glorious. The cost is more than sanity can bear.<br/>The Dispatchers: No backup. No assistance. Just a voice on the radio in the night, asking you for help. In this campaign, the player are cast as unlikely monster hunters, drawn together by a mysterious radio signal.
