After each encounter, players will have a chance to level up their classes and learn new skills, giving them more abilities and dice to use in the upcoming battles.<br/><br/>Players choose 1-2 heroes to control on a team of 3-4 heroes and gather a green die for each one, then add 4 attack cards per hero to make an attack deck. following the setup on the quest card players would then reveal a monster card for each hero into the center. Players roll a pool of dice then assign one to an available attack slot on their hero card(s). once all dice are assigned players reveal an attack card for each monster then resolve attacks from the lowest to the highest value of card or die. enemies target the hero that has an assigned die that is equal to or greater than their attack card value. heroes choose enemies to target and can use hero abilities at any point to gain an edge in battle. after all attacks the attack cards are discarded and heroes gather their dice again, roll and assign all over.<br/><br/>Defeated enemies, add cards back into the attack deck, if the deck runs out, heroes start taking additional damage. Once all enemies are defeated, Heroes have the opportunity to buy items and choose the next quest that matches the symbol on their quest card. They also level up by either flipping over their hero card and either taking an ability from one of those cards or covering up the bottom with a new class card.<br/><br/>Together you will either win and defeat the boss or have your party get knocked out by the overwhelming peril. If you win the next time you play the choices you made before will affect the next generation of heroes.

Within the pages of this 34-page adventure, we invite you and your players to visit Thistle;  a wonderful, whimsical little hamlet that can be found in the deepest glade of the sleepy Danby Woods. Here you'll meet an eclectic cast of personalities, all of whom share a common secret; that they are suffering beneath the crippling depredations of terrible nightmares.

It offers plenty of optional and modular content and easily provides enough materials for 2-6 sessions, depending on how voraciously your players set about devouring them. In addition to questing ideas and suggestions, the module also offers new rules related to handling dreams and nightmares, and includes a modest dungeon run as it builds to its conclusion.<br/><br/>In terms of theme, this product presents an enchanting, surrealist setup and aims to deliver on it without compromise throughout.

But sometimes, it can be fun to take on the mantle of the otherworldly, and to embrace the alien terrors of the cosmos. Each installment of Weekly Wonders: Eldritch Archetypes contains five archetypes for eldritch characters&mdash;those that are weird, alien, and otherworldly, who don&rsquo;t fit in with normal society&mdash;as well as a cleric domain devoted to a specific mythos entity or race.<br/><br/>For this book, we focus on Yig, a mythos deity known as the Father of Serpents, who first appeared in The Curse of Yig, by Zealia Bishop and H.P. Lovecraft. A cruel and vindictive deity of serpents and reptiles, Yig is the patron of all things cold-blooded and scaled, and the inspiration of numerous serpent cults. Beyond this, Yig is known mostly for his terrible and malicious vengeance, which has no peer. Whether or not they mention this dark deity directly, each archetype in this book builds upon these themes of reptilian abilities, birthing terrible reptilian-human hybrids, and seeking dark vengeance. This book contains the following archetypes:<br/><br/>    The serpent warrior, a fighter archetype that gains numerous serpentine powers, including a poisonous bite and legs that fuse together into a serpentine tail.<br/>    The snake charmer of Yig, a mesmerist archetype that is particularly effective at entrancing others, and can even transform his victims into snakes.<br/>    The Yig bloodline, for sorcerers descended from this dark god, who gain mastery over serpents and slowly become more reptilian themselves.<br/>    The Yig&rsquo;s cobra, a swashbuckler archetype that fights with serpentine grace.<br/>    The chosen of Yig, a warpriest archetype that can control snakes and even sire the dreaded children of Yig.<br/>    A bonus cleric domain devoted to those who worship Yig.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "215587": {"rpgartist": ["Justin Mason"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Ne'er Trust The White Wolf's Tameness (Pathfinder)", "rpgdesigner": ["Stephen Yeardley"], "rpgproducer": ["Stephen Yeardley"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3293431.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["AAW Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Mini-Dungeon Collection"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3293431_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>For 4-6 PCs of Levels 6-7<br/><br/>A teleport brings the party to a crossroads: floors, ceilings and corridor corners glow red; elsewhere pulses a soft white light.

Players are khans of different fantastical tribes on the Plains of Prax, each riding a unique animal that confers special abilities. Everyone attempts to amass the biggest herd, meanwhile fighting off enemy magic, stampedes and attempts by other players to steal their cows.<br/><br/>Each player chooses a Khan to play, and receives a set number of corral tiles (depending on the number of players in the game). Each Khan has a different special ability. For example, the Morokanth player gets one extra Corral tile, and the High Llama player can sneak one cow card into each of their corrals after the gate has been closed.<br/><br/>Players take turns to raid different locations, drawing cards from 10 different stacks. Each stack contains the cards, in random order: 1 x 100, 2 x 50 and 1 x 20 Cows, a Stampede card (discard highest value cow card), an Enemy Magic card (discard all cow cards), a Tribal Champion card (protects against Enemy Magic), and a Waha's Blessing card worth 20 cows, which a player can swap for another player's Cow card.<br/><br/>Each players' cow cards are placed face-up in front them as their herd. Instead of drawing, on their turn a player can corral their cows. Corralled cows are safe, but each corral can only be opened once in a game. Uncorraled cows count towards the final score at the end of the game, but remain at risk of Stampedes, Enemy Magic and Waha's Blessings. Because each player has a limited number of corrals, a key element of the game is deciding when to corral them. The player with the most cows&mdash;including those in corrals and in their herd&mdash;at the end of the game is the winner and acclaimed &quot;Khan of Khans&quot;.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual first edition", "Print and Play edition"], "average": "7.95", "name": "Khan of Khans", "playingtime": "25", "boardgamemechanic": ["Memory", "Press Your Luck", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "9", "usersrated": "14", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Glorantha  Board Games"]}, "215615": {"poll": [], "name": "SD Gandam World 3", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "yearpublished": "1989", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3374375_t.jpg", "average": "8", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Bandai"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3374375.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Japanese first edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "One of the oldest board games series &quot;Gundam&quot;, for 2 to 5 people. the SD Gundam was so popular that it became the third piece in the SD Gundam Series of the Patio.

It offers a dynamic play experience where players have to react and adjust their strategy accordingly. Each player starts with a small deck of cards, and uses those cards to acquire more and better cards for their deck, with the goal of earning the most Honor Points by gaining cards and defeating monsters.<br/><br/>Ascension: Gift of the Elements is the eleventh standalone game in the Ascension series, although the game can be combined with other titles for play with up to six players. This set sees the return of Events from Storm of Souls and Immortal Heroes; Events enter the game via the center deck and create an immediate impact for all players. However, unlike in previous sets, Events can now be acquired and transformed into powerful Hero cards.<br/><br/>This set introduces two new mechanisms: infest and empower. Infest allows you to mess with an opponent's deck, forcing them to draw useless cards.

Hence the designer explaining the game as a 'Trump Extension' game.)<br/><br/>Cards numbered A, 2, 3, 4, 5, and two jokers are investment cards. Five cards each are dealt to the players. Cards numbered 6-10 are tax haven cards. Players try to earn positive tax haven cards by playing investing cards.<br/><br/>When you invest on a tax haven card, you place a card stand along a border of the tax haven card and insert an investment card you want to play, so that one player cannot see how much you invest. Up to four players can invest on a tax haven card, and the highest investor earns the face value of that tax haven card. But one pre-determined suit counts negative, and a joker also inverts the sign if involved.

A team acts in collaboration while the teams have a competition against each other.<br/><br/>The card deck of the Scrum Card Game consists of four types of cards: <br/><br/>     Story cards describing features the team wants to create for a product,<br/>     Event cards with positive, neutral, or negative impact on game play and progress,<br/>     Problem cards describing permanent obstacles on planned Stories, and<br/>     Solution cards helping players on occurred Problems.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>By rolling two dice on each player's turn an amount of working hours per day spent on a working package is determined. This way if a full round (each player finishes an own turn) has finished a working day is simulated. Each three simulated days (which is called a Scrum Sprint) the players replan their work in a agile way. Game ends after three Scrum Sprints.<br/><br/>The card game is used so that players experience work in a simulated SCRUM sprint scenario. It allows reflection of many aspects and topics that happen in real life while working in<br/>a SCRUM team, too.<br/><br/>"}, "215918": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3335920.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Florian Sirieix"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2017", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Max Degen", "Ian Parovel", "Pascal Quidault", "Davide Tosello"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Asterion Press", "Ludonaute"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3335920_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Fantasy", "Party Game"], "description": "Our intrepid adventurers have sailed on a journey, finding the hidden cave of a mythic monster.

It was released on cassette which has the Amstrad version on one side and the Spectrum version on the other (called &quot;Flippy Flippy&quot;). The game used the same engine as Viz Design's (consisting of Steve Howard and Paul Smith) other game Frankenstein Junior which was released by Codemasters in the same year. The game was released two years late (and largely unfinished) and was as a budget title, as intended publisher Ariolasoft went bankrupt (being released by Mastertronic. It was also released in Spain by Dro Soft.<br/><br/>The game is set in London and the plot is to kill each of eight members of an aristocratic family who put a curse on the main character, resulting in his daily transformation into a werewolf.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>The game is played from a side-on 45-degree view, letting the player not only move left and right, but up and down. The character can also jump. The player starts off as a human who must roam the streets of London (including the London Underground and Hyde Park), and pick up items which will help the player in certain tasks. When the timer hits midnight, the player character transforms into a werewolf. The player must then track down each of the 8 enemy characters and kill, and optionally, eat their bodies, while avoiding being shot or captured by the police.<br/><br/>The game involved more strategy elements than the traditional 8-bit platform game, as the game changed mechanics and difficulty in response to the player's actions. For example, the more people that are attacked by the werewolf, the more active the police become. The Hyde Park location is locked during the night, and a ticket is needed to enter the subway (although rush gate can be done). When the Werewolf is sent to prison when 'touched' by a police officer with handcuffs. After transforms back to a human, the player is released or the player can escape by finding a crowbar to escape through the sewers (a torch is needed to see in the dark). Eating family members and NPC gives extra health, but being shot results in a constant health drop (in the form of a blood-bag icon). Finding bandages can stem the blood flow. If the blood-bag reaches empty, the game is over.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolves_of_London_%28video_game%29 Werewolves of London (video game)]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "215922": {"poll": [], "name": "Defenders of the earth", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Amiga release", "Amstrad CPC tape release", "Atari ST release", "Commodore 64 tape release", "ZX Spectrum tape release"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Comics", "Movie, Book, TV show", "Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamecharacter": ["Flash Gordon"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Enigma Variations Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Platform", "Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "Amstrad CPC", "Atari ST", "Commodore 64", "ZX Spectrum"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Enigma Variations Ltd."], "vgcharacterversion": ["Flash Gordon"], "description": "From ZX Spectrum instructions<br/><br/>DEFENDERS OF THE EARTH is based on the very popular T.V. series of the same name.

Dinosaurs still roam the Earth &amp; magic actually works! A sub-species of early Humans called Neuro-Evolutionary Rostral Developers (abbreviated as N.E.R.D.s) has recently evolved, &amp; N.E.R.D.s have been busy inventing all sorts of amazing &ldquo;cavepunk&rdquo; stuff.<br/><br/>One of their most popular inventions is the downhill racer, popularly known as the Whee in Cave-Speak. Many different styles of Whees have been invented, &amp; the N.E.R.D.s who invent them almost always claim their design is the best.<br/><br/>A bunch of prehistoric Clans have gotten together to test these claims. The Great Whee Race is about to begin! Each player chooses a Whee Racer, &amp; then purchases a Crew &amp; Cavepunk inventions. The racers then vie to be the first to cross the finish line in a race down a big hill. And just about anything goes in The Great Whee Race, so you&rsquo;ll have to outmaneuver, outfight, &amp; outwit your opponents in order to win!<br/><br/>The Great Whee Race is played on a track overlaid with a square grid. From 2 to 5 racers vie to make it to the finish line first. Each racer - called a Whee in Cave-Speak - is controlled by 1 player (or team of players), A variety of prehistoric-ish species serve as crew members, &amp; give various bonuses. Whees can be outfitted with melee weapons, missile weapons, or both, as well as cavepunk inventions.<br/><br/>Once the downhill journey begins, a simple card-based simultaneous movement &amp; action system is used so that players don&rsquo;t know where anyone else is going when they choose their movement. This has 2 nice effects: players are all active throughout most of each turn, &amp; perhaps more importantly, there are usually LOTS of collisions.<br/><br/>A unique &ldquo;game mechanic&rdquo; is used to resolve all actions: the Rok Draw. Every time they attempt an action or have a contest with another player, a player draws from a pool of tokens consisting of 3 kinds of Roks. Bonuses &amp; penalties add to or subtract from the number of Roks drawn. Most actions have the same target for success, so they are resolved quickly. Players can use 1 of 6 pre-made Whees &amp; crew, or can customize their own using a simple point build system. There&rsquo;s another PDF included with track sections, templates, Whee Racer stat cards &amp; models, &amp; all the tokens you&rsquo;ll need.<br/><br/>"}, "215966": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version 1.1"], "rpgseries": ["GEO - Living Greyhawk Geoff Regional Adventure", "GEO4 - Geoff Season Four", "Living Greyhawk"], "name": "A Necessary Evil", "rpgdesigner": ["Alisa Clary", "Byron Roberts", "Wesley Wright"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3300896.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Greyhawk"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (3.5 Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Wizards of the Coast"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3300896_t.jpg", "description": "A One-Round Living Greyhawk Geoff Regional Adventure<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/><br/>Grand Duke Owen has departed the country on a quest to find new allies for the war against the giants.
