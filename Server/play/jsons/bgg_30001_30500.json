As in August 1914, the Allies sent out a call of au secours to the Russians.<br/><br/>The Russians responded on 4 June with an offensive along the entire line of General Brusilov's Southwest Front.  This operation resulted in the capture of some 150,000 square miles of territory, inflicted losses of over 3/4 million, and force the Central Powers to weaken their offensives.  As great as it was, however, the Brusilov Offensive was not the strategically decisive victory the Russians needed to stave off internal collapse.

The tricky part is, that a player will lose points for any magic wand that is too long - having more than three stones.<br/><br/>"}, "30047": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Klisterhjerne", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1495055_t.png", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Damm / Egmont"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1495055.png", "boardgameversion": ["Damm/Egmont edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Trivia"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A spin-off from the Norwegian TV-channel TV2's game show &quot;Klisterhjerne&quot;.<br/><br/>The trivia questions are taken from the Norwegian elementary, middle and high school curriculum, and each players gets questions depending on their age.

Most of the results are either outs or hits (spaces for single, double, triple and home run), but there also are spaces for strikes, balls and base on balls. It is therefore possible but unlikely to get three strikes or four balls. There is one space for a foul ball, and any spinner stopping on a line is considered a foul as well.<br/><br/>The one strategic option open to the batting team is whether to have base runners try to steal. In this event, the stealing team spins again, but uses an outer ring where the results are divided between &quot;out&quot;, &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;sacrifice&quot; (where the runner advances but the current batter is out).

Definitely the king of game play pieces by weight alone.   The map contains a circle of spaces surrounded by 3 territories which hold the game's key resources- Manchukuo (Iron), Dutch East Indies (Oil) &amp; Ukraine (Wheat).  The game play spaces have actions (like collect $4 million or capture enemy plane) or consequences (sub sunk) and even political events (revolt, coup or treaty - which are separate cards).<br/><br/>The center of the board represents the armament factory and all the minatures begin there to be bought by the player as they build up their forces. The players move around the circle by the roll of the dice collecting and losing money, armaments and political cards to be used in the game.   The goal of the game is to collect military forces so that you can control the 3 territories (1 at a time or if you are strong enough, all at once). The players move military units into and out of the territories on their turns, conquering weaker opponents (and taking their units).   If you have the required military units in the territory and you have earned a propaganda card (by landing on the right space) you gain the resource of that territory.

Set up the double-sided playing board according to the level of play you choose.  Divide the 176 cards into four card groups:  GO, 1-2-3, Kanji and Dot.  Give the arrow a spin and let the race begin.<br/><br/>A card is drawn and players must think and react quickly as they learn how to speak, read and visualize Kanji symbols.  The first player to find the card's exact match on the playing board (matching color and symbol) and to place his or her pawn on the match wins the card.  Did you draw a Kanji Samurai card?  Now you must draw the Kanji symbol, the final step in putting it all together!<br/><br/>Whoever has the most points at the end of the round wins that game!  Sounds easy?

When players have played a card from one of their slots, they then quickly replace it with one from their deck.

These fill a number of roles with the most basic function being to act as an improved army unit, enabling players to roll eight-sided dice rather than the typical six-sided, but perhaps the most important function of the commanders is allowing the purchase and use of cards of various types. The addition of these cards, and in particular the addition of the Advanced Tech command deck, has a huge effect upon the gaming dynamics. With the addition of these cards the board is opened up making no position impregnable and no attack a certainty. With these cards in use, the game is more fluid with gaming positions and strategies needing to be constantly shifted<br/><br/>RULE VARIATIONS:<br/><br/>The Advanced Tech cards are designed for use as command cards alongside the original sets provided with the standard game. No additional commander token has been provided as it is suggested that the Advanced Tech cards be used in place of the Diplomat cards. If preferred, the Advanced Tech cards can be used in conjunction with additional tokens, representative of an additional commander, therefore allowing the use of all five of the original commanders as well.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/><br/>     Risk 2210 A.D.<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "name": "Risk 2210 A.D.: Advanced Tech Command Deck", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Area Movement", "Auction/Bidding", "Dice Rolling", "Variable Phase Order"], "average": "7.11111", "boardgameexpansion": ["Risk 2210 A.D."], "usersrated": "18", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Risk"]}, "30234": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic608276.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Kate Jones", "Wade E.

Artillery batteries are single stands as are army, wing, and brigade commanders.  The number of figures per unit is variable with each figure representing 40 soldiers or one section of artillery.  Stand size is variable with the number of figures so that units with more men cover a wider frontage.  (The game would be playable with other basing systems, but the game's basing has a number of subtleties that transmit the tactical feel of the time.  For example, units are longer in march column than they are wide in line as, indeed, they should be.)<br/><br/>Turns follow a set sequence with simultaneous movement and fire of various types.  Each turn represents 20 minutes of time.  Players mark orders for units that are hidden from the opposing player.  Command is an important element but does not dominate the game or become obtrusive.  There is also provision for grand tactical movement so that maneuver and closing to battle may happen quickly without taking too much time nor sacrificing tactical detail.  Combat tends to be bloody with stands taking figure losses as a result.  Morale of units is a key game concept.  Units have a basic morale point that is altered by loss of strength and the local situation faced by the units.  Battlefield events trigger morale checks.

It would become Wrangel's Kursk, a precursor to that more famous WW2 battle at Kursk but this happened at Kakhovka, a small town astride the Dnepr River.<br/><br/>Unique for it was only the second time in the RCW that a mass tank attack would occur (the first was in the Summer of 1919), fully supported by DH9A bombers and infantry against a very well prepared Red defense consisting of three consecutive trench lines, mines and barb wire. WW1 was in effect &quot;revisited&quot;. General Wrangel placed his blind faith in the tanks he had procured from the British, His tankers were well trained. He had even developed a combined arms approach. His forces, though outnumbered by 2 to 1 or more, continued to fight the &quot;good fight&quot; and had busted out of the Crimea in June, sent the Reds fleeing backwards for hundreds of miles with mass tank attacks and the ideal flat land. However, Wrangel was unable to secure the town of Kakhovka. The town had little real tactical value except for the fact the Reds held it. In September, several battles had been fought for it, each time the Whites were repulsed. Oct. 14th would be the last one.<br/><br/>The Reds had created antitank formation consisting of MkV and FT-17 tanks and a unique American weapon, the Maklen 37mm AA gun.

The play figures are not fastened to rods, but are mobile on the whole playing field.

Moving a play figure is done via a short, unique knock against the figure with a small stick as in the case for billiard. The play courses take place alternating, there are 'attack courses', with which the puck may be played by a play figure, and 'position courses' (defense courses as well as offside release courses), with which a play figure only may change position without touching the puck. Puck possession changes, if the aggressor misses the puck or hits an opposing play figure. Do-To-Ho was developed in Germany and published in 1994. Until now (2007) there are about 200 exemplars, all handmade. The antecessor of Do-To-Ho was Stahlkugelhockey (=Iron Ball Hockey), developed by the same author in 1980.

In the american translation of the book series the phrase &quot;Die Kosmische Hanse&quot; was translated as &quot;The Cosmic House&quot;.<br/><br/>In this game the players take on the roles of traders who transport goods between planets.

The goods cards are double-sided; randomize them, then place several on each planet grouped by type (but no more than 2/type/planet to start). Players' ships start on planet 1. Each has their own deck, shuffled; draw 5 card hand. The cards are mostly tech cards, which can give you ongoing power; or single-use cards (counter opponent's card by playing matching card yourself). Spend VP to play the cards.<br/><br/>On your turn, move your ship (costs less energy moving towards sun), pick up stuff (start game with only 1 cargo hold), deliver stuff. When you deliver, you flip the delivered cards over; any resulting matches are removed from game -- works as a game timer! You win by getting to target (70) VP.

It is a very simple word game best played with a large group of children, so it lent itself to social gatherings, parties, or holiday functions. The game consists of cards, usually small printed strips, with word groups printed, usually nouns. A leader reads the 'story' supplied with the game and when he/she encounters a blank, the first player to the left supplies the words from the card drawn. The play advances around the table, with nonsensical humor increasing with each blank in the story. Versions range from simple to deluxe--with quite complicated printed stories supplied.
