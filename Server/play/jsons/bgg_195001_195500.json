Knowledge or tactics may prove better? Whoever collects the most forints by the end of the game, will be the most succesful numismatic and the winner of the game. The game was created with educational purpose, and its aim is to present and teach Hungarian history. Every thesis has five questions, specific fot that era, which must be answered correctly to win the subject of auction. If someone doesn't know the correct answer for the question, he/she can hire the other players as experts, who will get payment for the right answer from the principal.

If you're clever you can complete multiple schemes in a single turn, and close attention is rewarded if another artist creates the scheme you were after when it's not your turn.<br/><br/>On your turn, you may spend two of the five colors in your palette for their effects. Red allows you to match the colors your opponents have, yellow lets you mix your colors and theirs together, and blue lets you swap a color from your palette with one of another player's colors. Playing two primary colors gets you a secondary color, which simply combines the effects of the two primaries. Playing two secondary colors get you a black, which you must use on your next turn and costs you your secondary colors.<br/><br/>As you change the colors you possess and your opponent's, you will be able to complete your goals, all of which are based on actual color schemes such as split complimentary and analogous schemes.

They are the first installments in the seventh generation of Pok&eacute;mon games. First announced in February 2016 through a special Nintendo Direct, both Sun and Moon were released worldwide in November 2016, commemorating the franchise's 20th anniversary.<br/><br/>As with previous installments, each game follows the journey of a young Pok&eacute;mon trainer (and the trainer's friends) as they train Pok&eacute;mon. This time, the game takes place in the Alola region&mdash;based on Hawaii&mdash;with the object of the game being to thwart the schemes of the nefarious criminal organization Team Skull, all while attempting to challenge various Pok&eacute;mon trainers of gradually increasing difficulty. Sun and Moon introduced 81 new Pok&eacute;mon species, and includes new features such as Alolan forms of previous generation Pok&eacute;mon, powerful moves known as Z-Moves, new, powerful creatures known as Ultra Beasts, updated battle and training mechanics, and improved polygonal 3D graphics. The games also adopted the previously introduced battle mechanic known as Mega Evolution, which was first introduced in Pok&eacute;mon X and Y. Although Sun and Moon are mostly independent of each other, both feature largely the same plot, and while either can be played separately, trading Pok&eacute;mon between the two games is allowed.<br/><br/>Upon release, the game received positive reviews from critics, and shipped over 10 million units worldwide within a week, becoming one of the fastest selling games in Nintendo's history. With 14.69 million copies sold worldwide by the end of December 2016, Sun and Moon are the third-best-selling Nintendo 3DS titles.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "195027": {"poll": [], "name": "Turtles Power Cards - Donatello", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Betting/Wagering", "Player Elimination", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Tactic"], "boardgameversion": ["Czech-Slovak version"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Comic Book / Strip"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Pick a power on your card and compare it with the values on the other players&acute;cards.

That is, followers are essentially currency and power for those with the divine spark. Unfortunately for most deities, followers possess free will; nothing gets in the way more of the best-laid plans. Most times when a true believer strays, a simple atonement spell &mdash; typically coupled with a suitable quest &mdash; is enough to steer things back toward the deity&rsquo;s favor. Sometimes, though, the offense is so severe an atonement spell just isn&rsquo;t enough. Some offenses are so severe, so drastic, that forgiveness is nigh impossible. The only recourse in these circumstances is to dole out swift and severe punishment. Most of the time, deities are loath to interact directly with mortals.

The one downside of living there was the constant infighting of the clans. They not only disagreed about the way the empire was built, but the way they traded with their neighbors, too.<br/><br/>The clans didn't agree on much, but the Emperor decreed that there was to be no open fighting amongst them. This &quot;peace&quot; lasted for many years. Then came the storm of all storms. Sweeping many clans away, the Emperor was lost for solutions &mdash; but then in the Osae Valley, a mist had appeared, and those who entered it were transported to a new land. The Emperor decreed that all clans should venture forth and settle their new empire.<br/><br/>As they did, the oversight was little to none...which lead to the clans competing for the favor of the Emperor by any means necessary. Now the clans of Amallian race to win the favor of the Emperor by building her Empire, trading goods, and showing the most strength on the other side!<br/><br/>In Legends of the Mist, you take on the role of a legend from one of the four clans. By rolling dice from your pool, you can work to build the Emperor's new kingdom with new plots, fight to control them, produce goods from them, and gain wealth for your clan and the kingdom. Each die type has a different frequency of letting you perform these actions. The other clans will work to undermine you every now and again and since dice are assigned in secret, your planning and foresight are important.<br/><br/>Should you complete the objectives that the Empress gave you better than anyone else, you will be rewarded as the winner of her favor!<br/><br/>"}, "195090": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["Forum Version"], "rpgseries": ["Game Chef 2004: Fantasy"], "name": "Chanter (2004)", "rpgdesigner": ["Jack Aidley"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2923582.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Chanter"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2923582_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>All-that-is is not like our world - it is world rich in magic and teleology.

Players unleash opening bombardments and then maneuver infantry companies against machine gun fire to fight battles on historically accurate maps of actual battlefields.  The streamlined system for fire and movement enables a rapid ebb and flow with minimal dice rolling and lots of historical chrome.  Generally speaking, units can move or fire once per turn &ndash; machine gun fire is the notable, unpredictable exception &ndash; and can initiate melee after a move.  Fire resolution requires only one dice roll, made by the target and modified for the relevant circumstances such as incoming firepower, terrain, visibility, etc.  Throughout, players must effectively manage the dynamic tension between top down control and bottom up initiative to get their units onto the objective before their ever-eroding control crumbles to nil.<br/><br/>A tragic irony of WWI unifies all aspects of game play.  For most of the war, effective command and control of tactical units required a degree of concentration which threatened their survival.  In other words, the game illustrates the inverse relationship between a unit&rsquo;s responsiveness to orders and its durability.  So players must &ldquo;form&rdquo; infantry units to get them moving and then &ldquo;disperse&rdquo; them at the right moment to hold the ground gained.  Enemy fire can force premature dispersion which must be remedied to get an attack moving again.  For infantry, the formed condition represents troops arrayed for the convenience of top down command such as those deployed in skirmish line or a column-of-march while the dispersed condition represents troops spread out and hunkered down for their own survival.<br/><br/>The game illustrates the evolution of tactics during WWI.  In time, gas wafts across the battlefield, unit statistics change to show better performance while dispersed, a new method of tactical command and control (the &ldquo;blob&rdquo;) emerges, mortars pop up like mushrooms after the rain, and artillery becomes more responsive.  In addition to short, standalone scenarios, RPC has a &ldquo;campaign&rdquo; mechanism so players can link a series of interdependent scenarios to simulate battles that spanned days, and nights.  During these campaigns, the results of one scenario affect the start of another so conservation of force, supply lines, and replacements all become issues.  Players will get a sense of slogging forward in yards per day - at great cost &ndash; as they plot days of grinding combat.<br/><br/>Product Information<br/><br/>     Complexity:                 6 out of 10<br/>     Solitaire suitability:      8 out of 10<br/>     Time Scale:                 10 minutes per turn<br/>     Map Scale:                  200 yards per hex<br/>     Unit Scale:                 Companies, squadrons, sections<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "name": "Red Poppies Campaigns: The Battles for Ypres", "playingtime": "1440", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "7.96986", "usersrated": "42", "age": "0"}, "195233": {"rpgdesigner": ["Christian Hollnbuchner"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "poll": [], "name": "Floating Desert Ruins", "rpgartist": ["Christian Hollnbuchner"], "rpgproducer": ["Christian Hollnbuchner"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2928894.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["Battlemaps (by Christian Hollnbuchner)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2928894_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>This full color battlemap is the 293rd of a series featuring various terrains.

If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.<br/><br/>The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.<br/><br/>Timeline: History of Russia can be combined with any other title in the Timeline series.<br/><br/>Card represent event related to the culture of Russia.

The player assumes the role of an Infantry Soldier during the grueling and miserable tour in the Trenches. As a Soldier, you are a member of a Rifle Platoon responsible for securing your Sectors of Front by successfully taking enemy positions and defending yours with the least amount of casualties. As you survive and gain experience, your Soldier will improve his attributes and gain skills to help him further survive the horrors of War in the Trenches.<br/> GAME OBJECTIVE <br/>The objective of TRENCH SOLDIERS is to successfully survive a Tour in the trenches along the Western Front during World War I. A Tour consists of a number of Rotations in the Trenches. The Player can play a Short Tour (1 Rotation), an Average Tour (2 Rotations) or a Long Tour (3 Rotations). Each Rotation consists of making a Rotation Deck of 20 &ldquo;Trench Life&rdquo; Cards and once all Trench Life Cards have been drawn and resolved, the Rotation is over and the Player totals his Rotation VP and adds it to his Tour VP. Once all Rotations have been completed, the Player totals his Tour VP and then compares it to the Victory Determination Table to determine the level of success. Players can choose to play as the Germans, French, Commonwealth (British, Australian/New Zealanders or Canadians) or the Americans.<br/><br/>GAME FEATURES: TRENCH SOLDIERS features plenty of colorful Game Counters and Game Mat. The Game provides plenty of grim themes associated with the War in the Trenches. Counters include Infantry Soldiers, HMGs, Flamethrowers, MK-IV Tanks, A7 Tanks, FT-17 Tanks, Pillboxes, Aircraft, Sub-Machineguns and Light Machineguns from the various Combatants.

Roll your dice and match your moves to the moves of the Bulls.  But beware the rodeo clowns!

Rodeo Clowns are kept, Blanks are rerolled, and everything else can either be kept or rerolled.<br/><br/>There is also a deck of 28 Bull cards.  Each Bull requires 3-7 dice to be placed on it.  Players must match their dice rolls to the moves indicated on the cards (turns, kicks, and bucks) in order to successfully ride the Bull.  At the start of a player's turn they draw three Bull cards and then roll the dice.  They can reroll dice as needed, according to the rules, until they either get Bucked Off (have three Rodeo Clowns, or too many Rodel Clowns to successfully ride a Bull), choose to Dismount, or successfully Go the Full Eight Seconds.  After each roll, including the initial roll, the player must discard one of the three Bull cards, until they are left with just one Bull to try to ride.  If they successfully ride a Bull before getting Bucked Off they'll get to collect that Bull card and earn the points indicated.<br/><br/>Throughout the game players can also earn Foul Tokens that let them reroll Rodeo Clown dice, add Bulls to their lineup, reroll without having to discard a Bull, or earn extra points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game goes until one player has successfully ridden three Bulls, and then everyone else gets a final turn.

Play continues until one player fails to hit the ball (cannot/does not want to hit or hits a ball badly), therefore losing the point (Falta) or the other player makes a great hit, directly winning the point (Tanto). After each point, the players recover a Player Trait card and replenish their hand of Good-play cards (up to 4 cards). The first player reaching 22 points wins immediately the game.<br/><br/>In double games, the teams are formed by a Forward and a Defender, and the games are also played to 22 points.

What hazards and ruins await south of the well-known dungeons of Rappan Athuk and Barakus? And, what has led to this land becoming known as the Sundered Kingdoms?<br/><br/>As part of the ongoing strategy of Frog God Games to take older and hard-to-find Necromancer Games products and update them not only to new Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and Swords &amp; Wizardry Complete rules but also to incorporate them into the Lost Lands setting as a way to introduce them to fans old and new alike, Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms takes three classic Necromancer Games adventures: Patrick Lawinger&rsquo;s Morrick Mansion, Casey W.
