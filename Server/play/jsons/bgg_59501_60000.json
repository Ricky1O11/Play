Only two living people know what really happened that night in Red Hook when devils and demons walked the Earth--an agoraphobic retired police detective named Malone and a very special young girl who wasn't even born when the events took place.<br/><br/>H. P. Lovecraft's imagination has terrified and entertained millions since his stories were first published nearly a century ago. As the inspiration for the Call of Cthulhu roleplaying game, Lovecraft's work has inspired countless hours of game play for investigators and Keepers around the world. Few of those adventures have directly engaged Lovecraft's stories themselves, but those that have offer an extra thrill--a bit of majesty borrowed from the master. The After Lovecraft line of adventures seeks to offer players and Keepers scenarios that directly build upon Lovecraft's tales, where the investigators themselves read Lovecraft's stories in game, as part of the adventure itself.<br/><br/>After Lovecraft: The Cold Case of Robert Suydam contains everything a Call of Cthulhu group needs for a few evenings of Mythos-inspired fun, including pre-generated characters and the entire text of Lovecraft's short story &quot;The Horror at Red Hook.&quot; It is the latest in the innovative line of officially licensed Call of Cthulhu scenarios and supplements from Super Genius Games.<br/><br/>"}, "59502": {"rpgdesigner": ["Allan Dotson"], "rpgitemversion": ["Print Version (Original Game Book)"], "poll": [], "name": "The Big Night", "rpgartist": ["Allan Dotson"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic583834.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["The Big Night"], "rpgpublisher": ["May Contain Monkeys"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Kid-Friendly"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic583834_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb: The Big Night is a cooperative storytelling game with puppets to cut out and color.

When scientists applied this new technology to Jobe Smith, a simple-minded gardener that everyone called The Lawnmower Man, they gave him everything he had lacked; intelligence, knowledge, physical strength, and even psychic powers. In the process of giving Jobe an array of superhuman abilities, they destroyed his sanity. Deranged and dangerous, he transformed himself into CyberJobe&trade;, an immensely powerful cybernetic creature living inside the DataNet, the world's computer network. His transformation started the War for Virtual Reality.<br/><br/>The Virtual Reality War is spreading through the DataNet and around the globe. Governments, corporations and individuals are waging secret battles against each other and against CyberJobe for control of the latest Virtual Reality technologies. It is the dawn of the Cybernetic Age, and espionage, conventional weapons, and the full range of Virtual Reality abilities are the tools that will determine the outcome of the War.<br/><br/>Now you can join in the fight for the control of the future. You will use Virtual Reality to learn and to acquire new abilities, to travel the DataNet, to wield psychic forces, and more. But you will find opponents with powers just as remarkable as your own, and will face the special dangers of Virtual Reality; living opponents and intelligent computers, the constant strains on your sanity, and CyberJobe himself.

It is basically a 100-games-in-1 cardgame system.<br/><br/>The Rainbow Deck (RD) is a cardgame system that has a total of 162 cards. There are 12 suits with each suit having 13 ranks, and 6 Joker cards. The suits are represented by both colour and number. The ranks are from 0 to 9, J to K. The cards also numbered from 0 to 119, and have letters from A to Z.<br/><br/>The RD can be adapted to play a variety of modern designer games, like what a deck of playing cards does for traditional cardgames. The difference is that the RD has 8 more suits, numbers from 0 to 119 as well as alphabet letters, thus it is most suitable for playing abstract games that require numbers, colours or letters. It can also be used by game designers as components in their own prototype games. Players can also combine the RD with other boardgames with components having colours, numbers or letters to form new games!<br/><br/>The RD can be complemented by 6 colours x 27 chips, 6 coloured dice and 6 coloured pawns/meeples. This allows playing of cardgames that require chips, dice or pawns. The chips can be marked using permanent markers with the corresponding values on one side. Also, the cardbacks have a 2x2 checkerboard pattern and they can be used to form boards which, together with the chips and pawns, can be used to play a variety of abstract games.<br/><br/>Decks that the RD can be mapped into<br/><br/>     Sequence of numbers of 0 to 119<br/>     Letters with values similar to Letter Head<br/>     12 suits (colour/number) x 1-13 values<br/>     6 suits (icon) x 1-23 values (2x10+3)<br/>     6 suits (icon) x 2 copies of 1-13 values<br/>     12 suits (colour/number) x 2 copies of 1-6 dice values<br/>     6 suits (icon) x 4 copies of 1-6 dice values <br/>     6 suits (icon) x 26 letter cards<br/>     n * 26 letter cards + rare letter cards<br/>     1 copy x value 1,..., 12 copies x value 12(Q), 13 copies x value 13(K+joker)<br/>     Double-Nine domino set x 2 copies<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Rainbow Deck - One Deck for Infinite Games!<br/><br/><br/>&quot;Interesting idea.

It&rsquo;s designed to be played in a single session for 3-5 players running anywhere from two to three hours.<br/><br/>In JiTP, each player will take on the role of one of ten versions of a man called Joe. These versions all come from different times and possibilities. One might be Joe when he was 12 years old, dealing with a school bully. Another might be a 20-something college student with a lecherous boyfriend.<br/><br/>Joe is a pretty obsessive person, so it&rsquo;s unsurprising that all of his variants are as well. Each of them is obsessed with a particular decision that he has to make, but has avoided making thus far.<br/><br/>All of the Joes in the game have come into contact with a person they know only as Keeton. From one innocuous conversation, they have each gained the ability to meet other possible Joes and influence them and their decisions. Unsurprisingly, after gaining this ability, most of the Joes choose to wander through time and space visiting and watching other versions of themselves rather than dealing with the decision they were avoiding in the first place.<br/><br/>The Joes embodied by the players are different, though. They&rsquo;ve all become stuck, fixated on one, specific variant that they&rsquo;ve found in their travels. They&rsquo;ve dubbed him &quot;Joe Prime.&quot;<br/><br/>Joe Prime is just like every other Joe: he&rsquo;s obsessive and he&rsquo;s avoiding an important decision. Unlike the player-characters, however, Joe Prime has not met Keeton.<br/><br/>Joe Prime&rsquo;s decision has become incredibly important to the stuck Joes. They each want his dilemma to be resolved in a different way, for different reasons. Maybe his problem resonates with their own, or maybe he&rsquo;s come to represent something about themselves that they hate. Regardless of why, they&rsquo;ve each decided to marshal their influence amongst the variants and push Joe&rsquo;s situation towards their chosen conclusion.<br/><br/>But the Joes are risking more than they know. Interacting with variant versions of themselves can begin to take a toll on their sense of self. In the end, they may have to decide which is more important: the safety of themselves and their variants, or the success of their self-imposed mission.<br/><br/>And what of Keeton? What does he want?

You&rsquo;ve felt that sinister truths hide behind a fa&ccedil;ade of normality, veiled partially by the rational, orderly &quot;natural laws&quot; we call science. And when night falls, when the shadows grow long and the wind whistles through the trees, you shudder and remember the truths of your ancestors, who were right to fear the dark.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ve just entered the World of Darkness, a world very much like our own, save that the shadows hide very real monsters (though most people fool themselves into believing it isn&rsquo;t so).<br/><br/>In Hunter: The Vigil, the sixth Storytelling game set in the World of Darkness, you and your friends tell the story of those people who have come to recognize the truth, that monsters exist. These individuals cannot sit idly by. They study their foes. They destroy them or steal their power. They use them as pawns against one another. It&rsquo;s not an easy thing, the endless hunt, the ceaseless Vigil. It is a thing of brutality and obsession, a slope slippery with the blood of those who came and fell before, a slope that descends into nightmare. And yet they can do no differently, because the Vigil drives them. They sacrifice. They push forward. They hunt.<br/><br/>This booklet contains everything you and five of your friends will need to play your first game of Hunter, except for some pencils, paper for notes and several 10-sided dice.<br/><br/>"}, "59730": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Extended Mission", "rpgdesigner": ["Jim Clunie"], "rpgproducer": ["Jim Clunie"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic603726.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Extended Mission"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Modern (Near Future)", "Science Fiction (Post Apocalypse)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic603726_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>The players take the part of robotic probes sent back from the Mars colonies to determine what has happened on Earth.<br/><br/>One participant acts as Game Master (GM) who presents the events of the mission to Earth and adjudicates the results of actions.

Among them, Timothy Dedeaux has given us two gems, Edge of the century and DIP-Styx. When I read these two games I realized that I could seemlessly adapt their conflict resolution system to Fudge and make Fudge even more abstract, which is, in my opinion a required feature for a universal gaming engine. No need to flip tens of pages anymore to compare the various weapons and vehicles listed by technology eras to build a complete weapons and armour list for your gaming universe. But Tymothy Dedeaux&rsquo; works also gave me the opportunity to implement the Story Element detailed in Fudge. The goal is to get rid off the rigid turn based resolution system inherited from the &quot;Great old one&quot; and to produce a cinematic action resolution system where fun is the key.<br/><br/>Based on Steffan O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s Fudge RPG, David Bruns&rsquo; Micro Fudge, Timothy Dedeaux&rsquo; DIP-Styx and Edge of the Century.<br/>Psionic powers based on Empire Galactique by Fran&ccedil;ois Nedelec, range table taken from MegaTraveller published by GDW<br/><br/>"}, "59744": {"rpgdesigner": ["M.

The priests of Ra seek to extend their power and fame. They do this by directing farmers, warriors, merchants, and scribes. They cause others to build granaries, fortresses, markets, and libraries. And they erect a gigantic pyramid for the glory of the Sun God Ra!<br/><br/>This game is a rework of Ra, with most of the same rules but completely different scoring tiles that come up for auction, some of which are two-sided, requiring players to choose which side they will make available for themselves... and for their opponents.<br/><br/>Board &amp; Pieces: The Board has 2 tracks, effectively time and auction.  Also there is a space between the two track for a spare bidding tile.  In a bag are all the Collectible tiles, some double sided, consisting of Sun of Ra, Priests, Plagues, People, Buildings &amp; Pyramids.  Bidding Tiles, used to win auctions.  Auction Token, used to show active player to maintain play order.<br/><br/>Play: The game is played over 3 epochs (rounds).  Each round ends when the Sun of Ra (time) track is filled.  <br/>Any non Sun tile is placed on the Auction track, in the case of double sided tiles the active player decides which side to use.  Auctions can either be called by a player (instead of drawing a tile), or automatic when the auction track is filled.  Each player may make one open bid, or pass.  The winner takes the tiles in the auction track and swaps his bidding tile with the one in the middle.  If all players pass (for example to avoid Plague tiles) then these tiles are taken out of play.<br/><br/>Scoring: At the each epoch VPs, or Ankhs, are awarded for most of a type or a variety of People &amp; Buildings.  Penalties are awarded for Plagues (which can be offset by a number of Priests).  People and Priest tiles are then taken out of play, Buildings, Pyramids &amp; Plagues are carried over into the next epoch, so can be scored again.  At the end of the 3rd epoch, Pyramids are also scored by construction height and tiles used.  Ankh collections are now converted to points.

This campaign is designed to operate throughout Babylon 5&rsquo;s second season, covering events both large and small. As a storm gathers on the horizon, the people aboard the &lsquo;last, best hope for peace&rsquo; struggle against all sorts of challenges. With this book, your players can take part in side scenarios tied into the individual episodes, or major events leading to a final showdown aboard a doomed ship behind enemy lines.<br/><br/>Season Two of Babylon 5 was dominated by what the Narns call the &lsquo;War of Retribution,&rsquo; which the rest of the Galaxy knew simply as the Narn-Centauri War. This period often threw the station in chaos. Narn and Centauri agents were everywhere, spying on each other. Peace efforts were attempted, stalled, and begun again. War material and refugees were funnelled through the station, sometimes leading to retaliation from the other side. Through it all, other beings were at work behind the scenes, watching and advising...and sometimes, when the moment was right, taking direct action.<br/><br/>This book is set amidst the events leading up to the Narn-Centauri War. The players, based on Babylon 5, will eventually find themselves involved in the war one way or another. Yet even as they make their way through the various scenarios presented herein, they will discover that they aren&rsquo;t simply participating in a few unconnected missions. The events that occur take the form of a season-long story arc, culminating in a final battle deep within contested space. In the end, they learn that the Narn-Centauri War is not, in fact, the true conflict...the greatest threat is still to come.<br/><br/>"}, "59760": {"rpgartist": ["Ian Belcher"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version", "Softcover"], "poll": [], "name": "Wheel of Fire", "rpgdesigner": ["Richard Ford"], "rpgproducer": ["Ian Barstow", "Brandon Bray", "Alexander Fennell", "Sarah Quinnell"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic603899.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "rpgsetting": ["Babylon 5"], "average": "6.16667", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Babylon 5: The Roleplaying Game (1st Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Mongoose Publishing"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Space Opera)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic603899_t.jpg", "description": "From Publisher Webpage:<br/><br/>Wheel of Fire continues the enthralling story of Babylon 5.

They are the ones who can do it all. Yet, despite their apparent friendliness and curiosity, they are a race fraught with internal problems. All too often their natural aggressiveness turns inward upon itself. Religious and ethnic groups are still at odds with each other despite centuries of alliance. Good-natured competition between nation-states and colonies all too often turns sour. The government, stable on the surface, internally struggles for control over increasingly independent-minded planets. Telepaths and mundanes remain constantly at odds, separated by genetics and decades of dichotomy. The human race may appear strong and confident from the outside, but internally, they are still struggling to find a measure of stability with themselves.

It was a time of great change and the responsibilities of the younger races were compounded by the loss of the Ancients. The galaxy - and all within it - was theirs. When a huge and ancient artefact was found drifting in hyperspace by flight crews of the newly neutral Babylon 5, it was brought back to the station to be studied. Bringing the artefact into realspace would trigger a chain of events the Vorlons were only able to postpone at their strongest, that would test the tenacity of Captain Sheridan and his crew to the fullest. Through the artefact they found a dimension they called Thirdspace, and the Harbingers it was home to.<br/><br/>&quot;This is a sourcebook for the Babylon 5 Roleplaying Game Second Edition that explains in more detail the events that take place in the Babylon 5 telemovie Thirdspace.

So it was that Hrofgar and his crew of bondsmen set out for home. But the Gods often have plans for the bold of heart and able of body and the north winds were unleashed upon Hrofgar and his crew, smashing their longship upon the shores of far northern Jutland, a desolate place of rugged men and great peril.

The campaign strives to be consistently fast-paced and exciting, and it takes advantage of the unusual setting. Investigation, clever planning, and physical combat are all important. For a plotted scenario, Queensguard grants players a large degree of freedom. Key tasks within each act may be completed in any order, frequent Contingency sections help the keeper adapt the plot to varied player choices, and players may succeed or fail in Act 1 without foreclosing opportunities in Act 2.<br/><br/>The four-session campaign detailed in this book need not be the end of your adventures in the Kingdom of America. A substantial amount of information about the politics, history, technology, and magic of the setting is provided in the next chapter, A Tour of the World of Queensguard.

The standard vampire that we know as the common variety is far removed from this first cause, but it still thrives on the same negative energy. Vampires have a natural sensitivity to places where negative energy pools, and this is why they are often found at the center of wars, revolutions, and corruption.<br/><br/>But there is more to this story. Unbeknownst to all but the most erudite sages, vampires are a necessary byproduct of the natural order of things. The process that forms a vampire spawn from a creature slain by a vampire actually sucks ambient negative energy out of the prime material plane, concentrating it in the undead life force of the newly revived spawn. Vampires act as living conduits of negative energy, channeling it into themselves through their own actions, then feeding off it and destroying it in the process.<br/><br/>Thus, the deities that govern good and law allow vampires to exist. Their followers are sent to defeat the vampires, but the scales can never tip too far. By their very nature, vampires act as lightning rods for negative energy; as they feed off it, they reduce its concentration in the world, and they absorb the foul byproducts of human conflict that would otherwise attract far greater evils.<br/><br/>A few vampires gain true insight into their natural position in the world. These arch-vampires do not accept that the gods should &quot;allow&quot; vampires to exist. The most powerful arch-vampires become demi-gods and travel to the outer planes, where they direct armies of minions and sponsor other arch-vampires.<br/><br/>For generations, the old gods regarded the arch-vampire demi-gods as a natural correction mechanism, much like wolves who feed on overpopulated deer. But now the wolves seek to become king. The vampire armies are becoming more active, and the forces of good have stepped up their efforts against them. For the first time, the scales are tipping toward the vampires' favor.<br/><br/>The Complete Guide to Vampires takes you into this world of bloodlust and power in an exploration of the greatest monster of all time.

The standard T-rex is present, of course, in both the forms that history has known it: the sluggish, tail-dragging version painted by Charles Knight, and the modern, fleet-footed version depicted in Jurassic Park. But we go even further than that. (This is a fantasy game, after all.) Modern reptiles continue growing their entire lives. What if T-rex was the same? What if this king of predators (whose only natural enemies were his T-rex rivals) survived to extreme ages? How large could he get?
