Technology has begun its slow and steady rise within civilization, while many still cling desperately to the magic of old.

But for the Eternals, the cycle continues as it always has. For them, there is only... strife.<br/><br/>Strife: Shadows and Steam is a stand-alone sequel to Strife: Legacy of the Eternals. Using the same core mechanics, Strife: SaS introduces new characters, abilities and a unique twist or two that will be sure to add a fresh take on this exciting game. This sequel is also fully compatible with the original game, so you can face off with champions of Aerim from different ages!<br/><br/>Strife, a two-player strategy card game that plays in around an hour, is a game where you always know your opponent's options. Aside from mastering the unique combo-creating gameplay of your champions, figuring out how to outmaneuver your opponent is where the true challenge lies.<br/><br/>Each player has the same hand of ten champions and will simultaneously play them as they fight over key locations throughout Aerim worth varying victory points. Each champion has a battle ability that's triggered during battles and a legacy ability that can be used only while on top of the legacy pile. This creates an intricate latticework of strategy for the players as each champion must be considered for not only what he can do in the current battle, but for which ability he will add to the next.<br/><br/>Further impacting the critical decisions within the game is the Fatestone tie-breaking system. The Fatestone starts at a value of one, and whoever holds the Fatestone die loses all ties; that player may instead pass the stone to his opponent to claim a victory in that tie, but doing so raises the value of the Fatestone by one each time it is passed. At the end of the game, the player holding the Fatestone adds its final value to his victory point tally.

Steam is used to power different attacks or shift gears from first to second gear.<br/><br/>The arena has three different steam vents located throughout. A normal steam vent, a gear vent, and a hatch vent. These can be turned on or off with a die roll. When the vents are on, moving over them can increase the amount of steam in your tank but at the cost of some life. Gear cards could appear on the gear vent with a die roll. The hatch vents are used to move a player from the gear vent.<br/><br/>Gear cards are equipped by players to modify the player's stats. Playing cards are used to help launch attacks or defend. Combat is determined by a die roll adding any modifiers and comparing it to the defender's defense with their modifiers.<br/><br/>The game ends when there is only one person left alive.<br/><br/>Gear Grinders is the first game from Roll One Games Limited.<br/><br/>Game time is 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on the number of players and the aggressiveness of the game play.<br/><br/>"}, "177558": {"rpgdesigner": ["Ralph Burkhardt", "Christian Fischer", "Michael Junker", "Rolf Knitter", "Mirko Schaper", "Daniel Stein", "\"stylo\"", "Alexander Tappe"], "statistics": [], "name": "Envoyer (Issue 17 - Mar 1998)", "rpgartist": ["Wolfgang Hoppe", "Michael Junker"], "rpgproducer": ["Ralph Burkhardt", "Thomas Englerth", "Christian Fischer", "Michael Junker", "Rolf Knitter", "Thiemo Nehm", "Gunnar Segerdahl", "Daniel Stein", "\"stylo\"", "Alexander Tappe"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2516420.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Envoyer"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgpublisher": ["FZ Werbung Hannover"], "rpgissueversion": ["Print"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2516420_t.jpg", "description": "User summary<br/><br/>Issue #17 contains a range of articles and reviews, comics, the scenario &quot;Wolfsgeheul&quot;, riddles and gimmicks.<br/><br/>"}, "177559": {"boardgamedesigner": ["David Manley"], "poll": [], "name": "Steamer Wars", "playingtime": "240", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2517298_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Long Face Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2517298.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": ["Miniatures", "Nautical", "Wargame", "World War I"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "&ldquo;It is both the duty and the tradition of the Royal Navy to engage the enemy wherever there is water to float a ship&rdquo;<br/><br/>A &ldquo;fast play&rdquo; game covering primarily the naval engagements on Lake Tanganyika during the First World War, and also any number of real and hypothetical small craft actions during the period 1910-1920.

Try something Strange instead!<br/><br/>In development in one way or another since June of 2013, Strange Magic offers up three brand new magical subsystems with freedom as their modus operandi. Build custom spells from the ground up with ethermagic, compose your own scores with musical composition, and weave ridiculous combos and reverse recitations with truename magic.<br/><br/>The component thirds of Strange Magic, Ultimate Ethermagic, Ultimate Composition, and Ultimate Truenaming, may be purchased separately. An upcoming loyalty program will allow those who purchased these pieces to get Strange Magic at a discount. Additionally, those who purchase PDFs of Strange Magic before the hardcover edition is ready will be able to purchase the hardcover at a discount.<br/><br/>Ethermagic<br/><br/>Ethermagic takes equal parts Douglas Adams and H. P. Lovecraft to produce an 'all day long' system of magic with a cosmic flavor. Spiritual successors to the warlock base class of the 3.5 days, the ethermagus, ethermancer, and etherslinger base classes seek to have improved playability by offering the ability to mix and match spell effects to make custom evocations on the fly. Whereas the warlock simply blasted, the ethermagician can ask, 'How hard?', and can even choose to be an interesting hybrid class rather than a pure-blooded caster.<br/><br/>Thanks to the advent of a rapidly-regenerating spell point pool, players must choose whether or not to spend more than they will regenerate next turn. Incredibly potent effects are indeed possible, but firing them off without a care in the world will reduce the player to single-target ranged touch attacks in a hurry!<br/><br/>Musical Composition<br/><br/>In the real world, great musicians are some of the most creative people that you will ever meet. When sitting down to play one in tabletop gaming, however, musical performance boils down to a short list of canned abilities that are autogranted at particular level thresholds. In short, gaming a musician is not the creative enterprise that actually being one is.<br/><br/>The musical composition system seeks to capture the raw creativity of music with the advent of a freeform composition system. Players combine intros, melodies, and outros to compose custom scores, which are then conducted in much the same way that a bard performs his performances. Each base class contained herein takes a different spin on the concept, combining it with spellcasting, arcane magic, divine magic, or more freeform musical composition, as the case may be.<br/><br/>Composition's transformative archetypes are not mere flavor packages, but instead modify the very root of the composition system itself, to the point that each base class can be made almost unrecognizable by piling on two or three of them.<br/><br/>Truename Magic<br/><br/>We call it the First Language, and anything spoken in this most primal of tongues is law. Be the speaker king or peasant, the universe is compelled to shift the very fabric of its being to conform to that which is said. Complex beyond comprehension, this ur-tongue contains syntax and vocabulary capable of describing all that can conceivably exist in this, or any other universe. Though perfect mastery of such a construct is impossible for even the gods&mdash;this is why deities have portfolios&mdash;even a mortal can learn enough of the First Language to effectively BE a god with an incredibly narrow focus. These obsessive scholars and phoneticians are collectively called the truenamers, and their efforts to capture the power wielded by the gods themselves upsets everyone from clerics to cultists.<br/><br/>Truename magic features the recitations system, in which spells are cast upon successfully making a truenaming check (same as a concentration check, but a different name so other content can't break it) against the level of the recitation. Each time a recitation is recited, its check DC increases by +2 until the following day.

Are the heroes masters of tech, the supernatural, or both? If magic exists, does it rely on willpower and Hermetic knowledge, or on properly programmed computers? Do the monsters the hunters face hail from our world, the third level of Hell, another planet, or all of the above? Applied Xenology will help you find answers:<br/><br/><br/>     &quot;Scientific&quot; character revisions. Every supernatural-themed template from GURPS Monster Hunters 1: Champions and GURPS Monster Hunters 4: Sidekicks is discussed in depth and (where possible) revised to fit a focus on the scientific rather than the paranormal. What happens to the sage if magic doesn't exist? Does Mysticism have a place in a world without demons and undead? How do warriors stay relevant in the face of TL9+ weaponry? Find answers to these and many other questions.<br/>     Technomagic. This revamp adds a &quot;sheen of science&quot; to Ritual Path magic -- but it's more than just a reskin! Technomages need computer hardware and software to operate at full power, creating spells as programmed &quot;scripts&quot; they can run immediately, save, or even email to a friend.

Through Chicanery, Seren is allowed to draw 1 Resource card from the Seasons Resources at the beginning of each of her turns, and she can choose from any of the four types (Armory, Tavern, Market or Sorcery). This ability frees her up from visiting the Citadel's buildings as frequently as other Heroes, and gives the Heroes a way to get at least one Resource card per turn. Note that unlike Kador's Archmastery or Orobox's Intimidation skills, Seren may only draw from the Season Resources, which drains from the Heroes' common resources and makes her options limited if the Season resource decks are depleted.<br/><br/>Axel, the Engineer<br/>As an Engineer, Axel comes with the Royal Artilleryman starting Special Ability. With it, Axel gets a free action per turn to either Rotate or Shoot the Catapult, and it can help the Heroes in crucial moments! Each Catapult shot may kill up to three enemies and it has a Strength of 4, so it can kill M&ouml;lens or severely damage the Avatar! The option to rotate the catapult is also important because Axel may use it to aim the catapult for another Hero, allowing him or her to shoot twice with the catapult in their turn if they wish to do so!<br/><br/>Eyra, the Thief<br/>Last, but not least, Eyra the Thief brings two starting Special Abilities that emphasize her roguish nature: Filch and Archer's Discipline. With Filch, Eyra &quot;accidentally comes by&quot; one Market resource card at the beginning of each of her turns. These Tavern Resource cards come directly from the Tavern Resource pool, so she may get a card even if the Tavern is damaged or destroyed. With her trusty one-handed crossbow and Archer's Discipline, Eyra is able to shoot with better precision at enemies in Zone 2, making her a valuable asset to help control Krohns and Gargohs and filching Tavern cards every turn!<br/><br/>"}, "177630": {"poll": [], "name": "Swop It", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "8", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Nicotext"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Party Game", "Real-time"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Back cover text (translated):<br/><br/>&quot;Swop it&quot; means &quot;to trade&quot;, and that's exactly what this game is about -- trading clothes with each other!

They can go up levels (up to 4) and with each level they grant more to the school they work for. Up to 2 levels can be earn in the usual tavern brawls... but the other 2 must be gain in quests or challenging the DARK TOWER.<br/><br/>Archimago has several elements shared by traditional Eurostyle games that use worker placement but at the same time potions and spells provide and interaction with the other players that if mastered can be of a great assistance to the School, events change game conditions, Characters can appear and add a new location to go to, etc.<br/><br/>The base game comes also with 1 scenario that is made of a set of cards that are mixed with the adventure cards and that when are dealt change the conditions of the game or offer sudden opportunities for the players that have the resources to risk or the desire to count on fate for better possibilities.<br/><br/>The game is modular so it is highly expandable in several directions that will add to the system new possibilities and the feeling of adventure, starting with new scenarios that will make each game feel different, characters that will appear in the different locations to assist the players, events that will happen when creating potions and more sudden apparitions that will contribute greatly with the atmosphere of the world.<br/><br/>The game ends on 1 of 4 conditions:<br/><br/><br/>    The adventure cards spots cannot be filled.<br/>    2 or 3 lines of potions/spells are depleted.<br/>    Sometimes a Scenario Card will end the game when certain conditions are given.<br/>    When all the Dark Tower Cards are gone.<br/><br/><br/>In the end Archmage is more than an eurogame, an experience that is worth trying. Each adventure card has been carefully designed so the title leads to the story below. Beyond the abstract elements there is a story going on in the game that those players that are fan of the detail will certainly love.<br/><br/>Spanish description:<br/>El Archimago esta muriendo... un sucesor debe ser encontrado de entre las 4 escuelas de magia, asi que un concurso se realizara.

A prototype cartridge surfaced in 1997. Only one physical copy of Ewok Adventure is currently known to exist. Because the game's controls were more complex than has been the norm on console games at the time, Parker Brothers persuaded designer Larry Gelberg to change the controls to a more common 8-direction lay-out. However, Geldberg was convinced of the abilities of the players and Parker Brothers shot the project down. Larry Geldberg gave the only known prototype of the game to his son in 1997, who later sold the game for $1,680.<br/><br/>In Ewok Adventure, the player takes the role of an Ewok in the hang glider corps with the mission to destroy a shield generator of the Imperial army. The player can control a hang glider with the joystick and has to evade enemies. Depending on the game mode, the player can either make the hang glider climb and decent by pulling back and forth the joystick, or he can reverse the vertical directions. Hitting the ground results in a game over, but when flying high, one can fly over enemies. The height of the glider is displayed by the location of the shadow of the ship. Furthermore, the player can pick up rocks to drop on enemies when flying over them.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Star Wars: Return of the Jedi: Ewok Adventure&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "177763": {"poll": [], "name": "Metroid Dread", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Nintendo DS edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2479966.png", "videogameseries": ["Metroid"], "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "videogamegenre": ["Scrolling"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Nintendo Co., Ltd."], "videogamefranchise": ["(Unreleased Games - Cancelled)", "Metroid"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo DS"], "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Nintendo Co., Ltd."], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2479966_t.png", "description": "<br/><br/><br/>    <br/>        <br/>UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        <br/>This game was cancelled in development.

One die is a vowel die, with a e i o u and an 8-ball on the faces. Five dice have a mix of consonants, vowels and wild sides.  Players roll the vowel die to determine who goes first. Each player receives starting money from the bank and a Jackpot Fund is started. <br/>On their turn each player rolls all 6 dice. The goal is to make the longest word possible with the letters on the face of the dice. The player may roll up to 3 times per turn, but must keep at least one die per roll. The first roll is free; money must be paid to the Jackpot Fund for each extra roll. If the 8-ball face is rolled the player's turn is immediately over. Each turn must be finished before the timer runs out.<br/><br/>Scoring is based on the length of the word the player makes. Longer words pay more money. The Jackpot is won when a player makes a 6 letter word without using any wild sides. The winner is the player who has the most money at the end of a predetermined time, or the player who reaches a predetermined amount of money first. Additionally, each die has an orange letter on one face that spells the word &ldquo;MAVENS&rdquo;. Spelling MAVENS instantly wins the game.<br/><br/>"}, "177770": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jaffer Batica", "Tyler Bielman", "Randall N.

It is a partnership trick-taking game, in the same family as Whist and Boston, with a substantial difference from most such games: players bid and score individually.<br/><br/>Bidding and play is counter-clockwise, and traditionally trumps are always Hearts.  In turn, each player bids a number of tricks they expect to take.  The dealer, who bids last, can potentially cause the hand to be re-dealt by the next player if the total bid score count is less than 11.  Play is as in most trick-taking games: match suit if possible, otherwise trump if desired or  throw off; highest card of the suit led wins, unless trump is played, in which case highest trump wins, and winner leads to the next trick.<br/><br/>A player scores a number of points equal to their bid if they get at least that many tricks on their own (so 3 points for bidding 3 and winning 3 or more tricks), and loses that many points if they fail to get their bid (so -3 points for bidding 3 and winning 2 or fewer tricks).  A bid of 7 or above is for double stakes (14/-14 for 7, 16/-16 for 8) and guarantees that the hand is played.<br/><br/>The winning partnership is the first to have a player reach at least 41 with their partner's score above 0.<br/><br/>"}, "177795": {"poll": [], "name": "CLANG", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2479966.png", "videogametheme": ["Historical", "Medieval"], "videogamegenre": ["Action RPG"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Subutai Corporation"], "videogamefranchise": ["(Unreleased Games - Cancelled)"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Subutai Corporation"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2479966_t.png", "description": "<br/><br/><br/>    <br/>        <br/>UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        <br/>This game was cancelled in development.

Worse, the existing psionics system didn&rsquo;t accurately model comic book psionics: fearsome and nearly unstoppable if they&rsquo;re clever. Instead of focused competence and overwhelming, unique powers, you have unfocused classes like the Battlemind who is forced to choose a variety of random abilities each level. Since the Psionics system is modeled on the D20 magic system, not psis as they appear in comics and sci-fi, it doesn&rsquo;t model psychic warriors with any particularly passion or depth.<br/><br/>When I first began producing psi-war classes for Skortched Urf Studio&rsquo;s D7ACU line, I dealt with the problem by producing psions built around a single tightly focused theme. Comic book inspired heroes like the Gravity Slinger and Cold Bringer, not to mention the new classes in Psi-Watch, are built around a logical progression of linked abilities, not wide (but unrelated) powerlists. To me, that&rsquo;s closer to the &lsquo;reality&rsquo; of psychics in comics and sci-fi.<br/><br/>While nothing prevents Psi-Watch psions from multiclassing, for the most part, pyrokinetics stay pyros, time travelers focus on improving their time talents, and nano-sculptors focus on improving their cellular engines.<br/><br/>In addition to selecting psionic classes, players in a Psi-Watch campaign can choose psionic feats which grant powerful natural mutations and mental talents. Designer mutations, alien heritage and random mutation can produce a whole campaign filled with powerful psi-soldiers.<br/><br/>Psi-Watch presents a slick, stylish new way of looking at psionics, not to mention modern espionage and supers gaming. The campaign setting owes a major debt to my life-long love of comics, and is inspired by my generation&rsquo;s comic book renaissance.<br/><br/>When Image Comics debuted in 1992, it was a hyper-violent, vibrantly colored underworld of government conspiracies, cybernetically enhanced mercs, psionic super soldiers, covert corporate strike teams and subtle alien invasions. While all too many of the early Image issues were crudely written and amateurishly plotted, their passion and intensity and vibrant imagination drew me in. Comics like WildC.A.T.s, Cyberforce, Stormwatch and Younglood drew on the best in comics, military fiction and cyberpunk to create an entirely new genre of comics. Innovations in art and storytelling fed back into the industry, spurring creative revolutions at both Marvel and DC. Many of the best artists working in comics today got their start aping the beloved styles of superstars like Lee, Liefeld and McFarlane. The design tropes and political savvy of the best Image comics inspired later &lsquo;mainstream works&rsquo;. &ldquo;Image style&rdquo; costumes revolutionized the look of everyone from the Legion of Superheroes to Batman to the Avengers, and a thousand more. Mark Millar&rsquo;s Ultimates and Civil War are thematic outgrowths of Jim Lee and Warren Ellis&rsquo;s early image storylines.<br/><br/>Psi-watch is designed to emulate the thrill of those early Image comics, to allow players and gamemasters alike to bring some of their sleek style and overwhelming firepower to the gaming table.

Each player controls two prisoners as they make their way through the winding labyrinth of a space prison, trying to collect enough oxygen to survive while denying their opponents the same. The goal is to collect as many points as possible (represented by oxygen tiles of different colors and values), located inside a maze formed by hexagonal tiles. Players must move across the maze and collect the points before their opponents.<br/>The game has 2 phases: construction and competition. In the construction phase, players take turns placing tiles and creating the the board (maze). Then the competition phase begins, where players move around the maze attempting to collect more points (oxygen) than their opponents. Where players place their tiles is of utmost strategic importance in the construction phase: Sector 6&acute;s building system allows strategic planning while the maze is being created. In the absence of a predefined configuration, each game takes place on an entirely new board.

Set in the universe of Schlock Mercenary, by Howard Tayler<br/><br/>At its core, the game uses a simple stat-plus-die mechanic for determining success or failure of a given activity. The dice in use are six-sided, and players will need three of them. Preferably three per player. Oh, and one of each set of three dice should be readily distinguishable from the other two, because you&rsquo;ll need more than just sum of the rolled dice&mdash;you&rsquo;ll need a few of the permutations. 6, 2, and 4 is a different roll than 2, 4, and 6.  This is less confusing than it sounds at first, and it&rsquo;s what makes the D6&sup3; system so versatile.<br/><br/>In the very first Schlock Mercenary strip we learn the slogan of Captain Tagon&rsquo;s company: Travel the galaxy, meet fascinating new life forms, and kill them.  That slogan provides a solid, thematic underpinning for this project.

These boxes can spread out in whatever direction is possible to make various shapes and can either be carried or thrown and pushed around. The boxes have various uses, such as allowing players to reach high ledges or cross large gaps, holding down switches, or blocking deadly lasers. Additionally, by hooking these boxes onto a ledge while Qbby is still attached, he can pull himself up.<br/><br/>Each level features one or more crowns, which can be collected with advanced play but will become uncollectable if the player uses too many boxes during a level. These crowns unlock additional worlds as the game progresses.

Those that survive are transformed by the virus, unlocking a latent genetic code. Now, the world is ruled by the three original species of planet earth: Vampires, Werewolves and super Humans.<br/><br/>BANE is a three-suited competitive card game, where the suits represent powerful races (humans, vampires and werewolves), each hunting another, locked in a conflict for dominance. The Order of Prey (who hunts who) is similar to rock-paper-scissors:<br/><br/>     Humans hunt Werewolves<br/>     Werewolves hunt Vampires<br/>     Vampires hunt Humans<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Cards are played to a board in what is called an engagement. Similar to a trick-taking game, once all players put a card into play one winner is determined using the Order of Prey (described above). Cards also have a ranking, called Speed. Unlike other trick-taking games (such as Spades) a player may not play a card whose speed matches that of a card already in play - thus allowing players to 'speed block' other players. There are eight speeds, represented by numbers in the upper-left corner of each card.<br/><br/>Example: After all cards are played during an engagement, Bob sees that his Pack Alpha (Werewolf, Speed 1) is the fastest. He will thus be able to take a trophy from another player, as long as there is a Vampire in play (because Werewolves hunt Vampires).<br/><br/>Taking a trophy means that the player may choose from a pool of face-down cards in front of another player.<br/><br/>The round (Hunt) ends when one player is out of cards or trophies. At that time, the deck is shuffled and a new Hunt (round) begins.<br/><br/>WINNING THE GAME:<br/>Each player tracks their individual score. A Player wins by reaching the MASTERY space on the score track and having more trophies than opponents also in the MASTERY space.<br/><br/>There are other elements to the game that add flavor (Special Power cards, a BANE token).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "age": "0", "name": "BANE", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Trick-taking"], "average": "7.5", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Card Games: Outplay Games"]}, "177944": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Char.

Der Anfang war offenbar nicht so, wie man sich das vorgestellt hatte &ndash; was sicher f&uuml;r beide Seiten des Werkes gilt, Leser und Autoren.<br/>Das Kleine hatte schon einige Schwierigkeiten bei seinem Start ins Leben. Die Zeit bis zum Kindergarten war holprig, wenn auch ambitioniert, und munter stapfte es drauf los. Meist war es in warmen Zonen unterwegs und erz&auml;hlte uns alles, was es so fand und sah. Vieles von dem, manche meinten gar alles, trug Fell. Das war neu und damit gewann es nur wenige Freunde. Andere wurden schnell davon abgeschreckt, dass es nach vermeintlich alten oder gar falschen Regeln lebte. So schwand das Interesse und es wurde recht still um das j&uuml;ngste Kind von Los und Sumu. Mit<br/>der Zeit bekam man den Eindruck, auch die Eltern h&auml;tten das Kind versto&szlig;en.<br/>Eine Handvoll Unerschrockener sammelte sich, das Kind auch weiterhin zu begleiten, seinen Geschichten zu lauschen, es mit eigenen Erz&auml;hlungen zu unterhalten und seine Entwicklung ganz<br/>allgemein zu f&ouml;rdern. Die Namen dieser fr&uuml;hen Helden sind Benjamin Filitz, Johannes Borgwardt, Ines Krtschil, Jan Philipp Fiedler, Bernadette Wunden, Tobias Mauritius Fink, Kai Frederic Engelmann, Matthias L&ouml;ffler und Stephan Rubach. Sie gr&uuml;ndeten die Memoria Myrana und hielten das Interesse am G&uuml;ldenland aufrecht. Schaut man heute zur&uuml;ck, m&ouml;chte man meinen, ohne sie &ndash; ohne das eigene Schreiben, ohne das immer wieder Herantreten an die Redaktion auf Cons, das Fordern neuer Publikationen &ndash; w&auml;re die Geschichte vielleicht eine andere geworden.<br/>Andere kamen in den Jahren seitdem hinzu, wie u. a. Ren&eacute; Littek, Christian Sa&szlig;enscheidt, Jochen Willmann, Kirsten Schwabe und auch ich.<br/><br/>Die Helden der ersten Stunde, sind leider schon l&auml;nger nicht mehr dabei, ebenso wenig, wie die meisten Autoren der fr&uuml;hen Publikationen. Die allgemeinen Entwicklungen und Umw&auml;lzungen im derischen Kosmos und dem Setting selber haben ihre Spuren eben auch bei Myranor hinterlassen. Heute schreiben ein bis zwei Dutzend Menschen f&uuml;r den Uhrwerk Verlag an Myranor. &Uuml;ber 80 Publikationen, Artikel und Produkte sind in den bisherigen Jahren entstanden.<br/>Mit Beginn der &bdquo;Schulzeit&ldquo; kam das Kleine in neue Obhut und wurde dann dem netten Onkel Pat in Pflege gegeben, der sich auch heute noch um das mittlerweile zum Teenager gewordenen Kind k&uuml;mmert. Ihm zur Seite stehen inzwischen einige derjenigen, die ihre ersten Erfahrungen mit Myranor im Rahmen des Fanzines machen durften. Auch dieses hat nun zehn Jahre &uuml;berlebt und sich damit in die Senioren-Reihe von Fanzines hineingeschrieben. Beide Ereignisse, Jubil&auml;en beruhen auf der gleichen Grundlage: dem Engagement und der Treue von Fans. Das war der Antrieb Myranor auch gegen Fanpros M&uuml;digkeit zu unterst&uuml;tzen und der Anlass f&uuml;r Patric G&ouml;tz Myranor zu &uuml;bernehmen und weiterzuf&uuml;hren.<br/>Und deshalb ist diese Sonderausgabe auch keine dicke Werbet&uuml;te mit Geschichten &uuml;ber &bdquo;fr&uuml;her war alles besser&ldquo;, &bdquo;Was ihr schon immer &uuml;ber Myranor wissen wolltet, &hellip;&ldquo; oder einer Klappentext-Sammlung aller Publikationen.

FF3D is designed to be played with 2 or 4 players, though expansions can easily allow up to 16 players. FF3D can be played in anywhere from 60-120 minutes, depending on the length of time players spend on their initial drafting process.<br/><br/>The base game of Fantasy Football: Draft, Deals, and Dice allows players to compete with each other over a shortened four week fantasy football season. The Owners have the opportunity to draft their fantasy rosters from a pool of randomized Players at the start of the season. The Team and Player Ratings are randomized at the start of each season, so no two seasons will ever be the same. One year, the San Francisco QB could be a star player with major upside &ndash; the next year, he could be a mediocre talent that shrinks in the Primetime. The winner is able to initially assess the random market conditions of the league to maximize their draft selections within their roster restrictions, as well as able to navigate the flow of the season&rsquo;s Defensive Matchups, Injuries, Hot Streaks better than their opponents.<br/><br/>After establishing agreed upon Roster Requirements for the League, the game begins with (and features) everyone&rsquo;s favorite part of the fantasy football season &ndash; the fantasy draft.<br/><br/>The Game is split into three main segments:<br/>The Fantasy Draft<br/>The Regular Season<br/>The Playoffs<br/><br/>Owners will draft a team of Players and set their starting lineups against the opposing Owner on their Fantasy Schedule. The Owners take turns determining their Weekly Results by rolling a specified number of Offensive and Defensive dice for each Player in their Starting Lineup. The number and types of dice rolled are influenced by the Player's Skill and Upside Levels, as well as any Team Matchup Modifiers, Player Hot Streaks, or Player Injuries that have been assigned to the player during the game play. In-Game Events could also trigger unexpected outcomes that can swing the momentum during a game. After all games have been played, the Owner with the most points in the matchup receives the win. At the end of each week, Players are randomly selected to either go on a Hot Streak or go on the Injured Reserve. Owners may replace Injured players by following a Waiver and Free Agency process against the other Owners to select Players from the pool of unselected Players from the initial draft. The first three weeks make up the Regular Season, with the Top 2 teams competing in Week 4 for the Championship.<br/><br/>"}, "177972": {"rpgdesigner": ["D.
