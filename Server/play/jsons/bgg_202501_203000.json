There are two sets of cards, Lord Mayor and Town Crier, that deliver random penalties and benefits.<br/><br/>Landing on an unowned attraction allows its purchase. Landing on an attraction owned by another player requires paying an admission fee. There is no building, but the admission fee rises as more attractions of the same colour are bought. The fee doubles with the second property, octuples with the third and goes to 50 times the base fee for a complete set. Most money wins.<br/><br/>The game bears no publisher identification or copyright, and has a self-published feel, possibly a prototype. The square board comes in two segments with smooth plastic taped edges and a hinge made from two Velcro fasteners.

They won't be exactly to scale or the game boards will be huge but we will preserve the authentic racing lines.<br/><br/>Each new circuit will be a self-contained game with up-to-date rules that incorporate New Season changes (such as a return to mid-race refuelling). If the rules change mid-season (as they did with qualifying in 2016) there will be a corresponding game rules change available for download from our main website. The new playing pieces will be in new team colours.<br/><br/>For anyone who wants to just keep the same track there will be an update pack available with the new cars, new rules and any additional cards that are necessary.<br/><br/>FWR does not attempt to simulate the cockpit driving experience: we felt that was being done much better with electronic console games. Instead, it gives you the fun of competing against family and friends around a table using tactical judgements about what racing line to take, when to try to overtake, when to come into the pits, what to do when the weather changes, when to take risks and when to play safe. The racing dice that contributes to movement only has the numbers 2,3,3,3,4,4. It adds to the fun and unpredictability but is rarely critical. Luck is a factor, just as in the real world but it doesn't dominate the game.<br/><br/>Far more significant might be a decision about whether to try to overtake the leader on the last lap when you are on dry tyres and it's started raining...<br/><br/>In the advanced rules, such decisions become more important. To simulate conditions across the world's racing circuits, there are 6 different types of weather that include factors like temperature as well as rain. You will have access to the full range of dry weather tyre compounds: ultrasoft, supersoft, soft, medium and hard. Three of these will be available for any particular game. Plus, of course, there will be wet weather tyres.<br/><br/>There will be several ways to determine weather conditions and tyre availability at the start of the game.<br/><br/>In addition, in the advanced rules you can change your driving style to suit the prevailing conditions and circumstances. For example, if you have a good lead or are running low on fuel you might want to reduce risk and drive cautiously. If it's the final lap and you want to go flat out to catch the leader, you might take more risks and push the car to the limit.<br/>All up to you!<br/><br/>We hope you will enjoy Fifth Wing Racing, collect the tracks and download the Championship rules in 2017 so that you can compete with each other through a season of races.

It may be the only boardgame where players actually hit a ball with a bat and see the outcome on the board.<br/><br/>The 2&quot; diameter ball is mounted on the top of a foot-long stand ending in a spring fastened under the metal board. The foot-long wooden baseball bat is used to strike the ball, causing the ball stand to fall across the &quot;umpire&quot;. This is a curved rubber barrier topped with 25 teeth and a string that runs horizontally through the teeth.<br/><br/>When the ball stand hits the umpire, it pushes into one of the 24 gaps, each of which is numbered. The gap it struck can be seen after the ball bounces back up because it kinks the string at that location. Each number is repeated along the outfield wall along with a result, from Ball or Strike to Home Run or Out.<br/><br/>Each team has a set of wooden peg players, and the play proceeds and is scored like a regular baseball game. There are dials on the board for recording balls, strikes, runs and outs during an inning, and paper scorecards for recording the results of each inning.<br/><br/>Later editions of this game did away with the umpire. Instead, the board had an outfield wall with three holes and a jagged top. The ball was on a string and if it went over the wall, each notch had an outcome like this first edition. In addition, players could score a home run or extra-base hit by getting the ball through one of the holes, but would be out if it hit the wall and bounced off.<br/><br/>"}, "202793": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Gun Based Archetype & New Gun System", "rpgdesigner": ["Nils Gunnar Kjersem"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3070259.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3070259_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>Includes class options and firearms data.<br/><br/><br/>     Barbarian Path of the Gunzerker<br/>     Bard College of Revolution<br/>     Fighter Gunslinger<br/>     Monk Way of Gun Fu<br/>     Ranger Nature's Guard<br/>     Paladin Oath of the Gun Saint<br/>     Rogue Marksman<br/>     School of Spell Slinging<br/>     Warlock Pact Pact of the Gun<br/>     Firearm List &amp; Gun Properties<br/><br/><br/>"}, "202794": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Medieval Firearms", "rpgdesigner": ["Ben Mowbray"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3070284.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["2nd Dynasty"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3070284_t.jpg", "description": "An Equipment Supplement for D&amp;D<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/><br/>Firearms have historically been a part of medieval warfare since the early 14th century and became commonly found on the battlefield through the high middle ages and early renaissance periods that fantasy worlds often portray.<br/><br/>This document is meant to introduce early firearms into your D&amp;D game.

The remaining cards serve as challenges (Trumps), wisdom (coins), strength (batons), volition (swords), vitality (cups), chance (aces), and helpers (royals). An adventure is created by laying out cards in groups of four. Progress is made through the journey by playing three of the four adventure cards. The fourth card serves as the foundation for a new adventure.<br/><br/>Volition cards may be equipped to engage individual challenges, depleting them of their power. Strength may be equipped to endure multiple challenges with any excess power from a challenge depleting the Fool's vitality. Vitality cards are used to replenish this value. Wisdom cards are used to deploy Helpers that double the value of a Vitality, Strength, or Volition card. Chance cards may be used to reshuffle all adventure cards back into the deck and begin a new adventure.<br/><br/>The game ends when the Fool's vitality reaches zero or he overcomes all challenges and successfully completes the journey.<br/><br/>This game was inspired by thematic solitaire playing card games, especially Scoundrel, Donsol, and Card Crawl as well as the Monomyth described by author Joseph Campbell.

During a turn, pack owners may also use an already learned Trick, or use an Alpha Trait. The turn ends when pack owner makes one of the following moves:<br/><br/>     Play a Dog Toy<br/>     Play a Power Card<br/>     Buy or attempt to lure a dog out of The Street or The Shelter<br/>     Use Treats to teach a dog a Trick<br/>     Change the Alpha Dog in their pack<br/>     Discard their hand and draw five new cards<br/>     Voluntarily choose to end the turn<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Alpha Traits: Each Dog has a special ability that can only be used when the dog is the Alpha Dog.

Tricks give pack owners an extra edge in the game.

For example, the &ldquo;Rubber Chicken&rdquo; card requires a die roll of 4 or higher to save the Dog from being taken by an opposing pack owner. However, all XL dogs take a -2 to all rolls against the Rubber Chicken. If this card was played against a Great Dane, and the pack owner rolled a 5, this modification would mean the roll counted as a 3. The Great Dane would be taken by the opposing pack owner. Alternatively, the Trick &ldquo;Sit!&rdquo; adds a +1 to any roll.

The cats in the regular suits can be values of 1, 2, or 3, while the rare cats are only value 1. There are also &quot;item&quot; cards that give special abilities.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 3 cat cards in the player's &quot;yard.&quot; The vacant lot begins as 4 face up cat cards and the rest of the draw deck face down. There are two ways to obtain cards from the vacant lot. First, a player may simply draw from the face up cards either A) up to 2 cats of value 1, B) 1 cat of value 2 or 3, or C) all visible items. Alternatively, the player may take a card from the player's own yard and return it to the vacant lot, then draw the top card from the deck. If the top card matches any of the cards in the vacant lot, the player gains the drawn card plus any that match it. (If no cards match, the drawn card remains face up in the vacant lot.) This second option may be repeated as often as desired until the player gains cards.<br/><br/>When gaining cards from the vacant lot, the player must be careful of the suit. The suit(s) in the player's yard with the most cards is considered threatening to cats in any other suits. If a player gains a card in a suit of which the player already has more cards than any other, one cat card in each of the suits with lower numbers of cats will return to the vacant lot due to fear.<br/><br/>Points are awarded at the end based on the highest value cat in the yard in each suit. One point is added for the player with a majority in that suit, while one point is subtracted from each player who has at least one card in that suit but does not have the majority. Every player with 2 or fewer suits at the end of the game gets a &quot;maniac bonus&quot; of 3 points.

The Purple King takes anything; the Brown Knight loses to everything; the Brown King takes any card of any suit lower than King, but loses to all the other Kings.<br/><br/>Each trick taken during a hand counts as two points. Each Viscount taken counts an extra two points. A game is normally to 40 points.<br/><br/>After the deal, each player starting to the dealer's left has an opportunity to make a Single Call. He may call a Peerage (five tricks), House of Lords (seven tricks), Royal (all the tricks) or Misere (lose all the tricks). Any player making a call then plays against all the other players. A successful Peerage scores 20 points, Misere or House of Lords 30 points, and Royal 40 points .

The name of the game appears on the felt along with an outline of a bug that has a round body, round head, two eyes, two feelers, six legs and one tail.<br/><br/>Each player has a sheet with 12 small boxes, each good for one game.

This new edition is quite different from Dean Essig's original game from back in 2000. It features a revised order of battle, modified rules, and a new map. The most obvious change is in scale: hexes are now 3.5 miles across and there are two turns per week (the original had 2.5-mile hexes and four turns per week). This makes for a smaller, faster game that conforms to the scale chosen for Beyond the Rhine and the upcoming games set in Western Europe. We think Sicily II is a perfect way to give new recruits their baptism in the fire of OCS, and is also a worthy entry in the series for players who have already earned their stripes.<br/><br/>Here are some of the game&rsquo;s highlights:<br/><br/><br/>     The entire campaign lasts just 16 turns.<br/>     There are six scenarios in all (three using the entire map, and three using just a portion).<br/>     The Allied airborne fiasco is recreated with simple scatter rules. <br/>     The amphibious landings can be played out using standard OCS naval rules, or players can mostly skip these and begin with the bulk of Allied forces already ashore.<br/>     The Luftwaffe&rsquo;s Do.217K makes its series debut, armed with exotic Fritz-X missiles.<br/>     Rules for Italian unit wavering and surrender make every game different.<br/>     Several interesting options are provided, including revised Axis deployment and variable entry of the 29th Panzergrenadier Division.<br/><br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 3 to 4 days<br/>Hex: 3.5 miles / 5.6 Km<br/>Units: Company to Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory (Operational Matters magazine version):<br/><br/>    One 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheet<br/>    Two dual-side printed countersheets (560 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>    One 16-page Sicily II rules booklet<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Players will have to use OCS v4.2 rulebook/charts &amp; tables for another OCS game or download them from <a target='_blank' href='http://www.gamersarchive.net/theGamers/archive/ocs.htm' rel='nofollow'>http://www.gamersarchive.net/theGamers/archive/ocs.htm</a><br/><br/>Complexity: Medium<br/>Solitaire Suitability: Medium<br/>Players: 1 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-20 Hours<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "8.275", "name": "Sicily II", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "0", "usersrated": "36", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Operational Combat Series"]}, "202944": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Bajevar Critter Book", "rpgdesigner": ["Mark Parish"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Science Fantasy)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3075432.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgproducer": ["Mark Parish"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["The Cypher System"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "average": "0", "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Bajevar Adventure Setting"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3075432_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>To call Bajevar (pronounced BAH-hay-var) a Campaign Setting would be inaccurate.

Range is measured not by star links but by number of squares counted orthogonally. Combat results are Hit or Miss, with the chance of a Hit increasing as range decreases. There are nine Firing Cards of 10 cards, with the number of the deck equal to the range and to the number of Miss cards it contains. Some of the result cards also trigger events through Space Conditions cards.<br/><br/>The movement and combat systems interact. When a ship succeeds in hitting and eliminating another ship, it gets promoted, by a degree that varies with the difference in ranks between the two. A ship's level does not affect combat, but does determine how many stars it can move in a turn.

These wars attracted naval officers recently unemployed&nbsp;by the end of the Napoleonic Wars as well as providing a proving ground for the first generation of naval heroes native to&nbsp;Latin&nbsp;America.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Updated rules introduce river and tidal currents, modified grounding rules for operations in the Rio de la Plata and Uruguay rivers, and the use of ship&rsquo;s boats to tow stranded or becalmed ships.&nbsp;In all, over&nbsp;two dozen&nbsp;battle scenarios ranging in size from a handful of ships per side, to full-blown fleet actions are presented.

The player with the last commander standing wins Emoji Wars and rules the Emoji Empire... until the next battle!<br/><br/>The general idea is easy - Players pick a Commander, choose 3 Allies and then battle their opponents with magic spells and weapons. The numbers on the cards line up so you can see if a character has the ability to wield a particular spell or weapon. You can also see how many &quot;Life Points&quot; a character has or how much damage he has taken from a weapon or spell.<br/><br/>1. Card Types<br/>Gold: Commander<br/>Green: Ally<br/>Blue: Spell<br/>Red: Weapon<br/>Yellow: Energy<br/><br/>2. Reading the Cards<br/>Each card has information about the character, spell or weapon in the numbers below the image. A character card shows life points, magic or strength ability and the energy needed to launch an attack. Weapons and spells cards show how much ability is needed to use them and how much damage they will do to a character by reducing his life points.<br/><br/>3. What a Hand Looks Like<br/>After a player has their &quot;Army&quot; assembled, they draw weapons and spells cards from the blue and red decks. Energy cards are included in these decks and get chosen randomly. A player's hand is visible to the rest of the table. Note that there are also &quot;Shield&quot; cards that add to a character's life points.<br/><br/>4. Attacks<br/>On each turn a player can attack his opponents if they have the weapons and engergy needed to do so. As an example attack, Orin is using the Deep Freeze against Garlon. The spell card is placed under Orin to show that his life points have reduced by 30. On a later turn, the player draws a Shield, which he adds to Garlon to increase his life points to 30. This is how much damage it will now take to remove him from the game.<br/><br/>5. Win<br/>When a player's Allies have been killed off, he fights with his Commander.

She wakes up, has tea, plays croquet, strolls through the gardens, and then goes to sleep at night only to soon repeat her daily, mundane, routine.<br/><br/>Alice becomes very disappointed with the simplicity of her life and decides to go out on an adventure. She travels to where she fell down the rabbit hole but alas, there is none when she returns. She sits and thinks and thinks and sits.<br/><br/>All of a sudden, a flower wiggles out of its seedpod underground, squiggles through the grass, and grows right up in front of her. Before her very eyes a wild white rose blooms and when the petals open, a small vial is revealed. &ldquo;Eat Me&rdquo; reads a tag on the bottle. Alice cocks her head to the side and thinks, &ldquo;This seems familiar. Eating organic is safe, so this must be safe&rdquo;.<br/><br/>In a dimwitted manner, she opens the vial, chews the contents, and swallows, tossing the vial behind her when finished. Alice sits there and stares at the clouds, as she often does. Not soon after, Alice begins to feel light headed. She then finds herself falling down a hole that opens up beneath her. Here we go again&hellip;<br/><br/>There are (3) game modes in Alice in Shroomland; Cooperative Board Game (1-4 Players), Competitive Board Game (2-4 Players), and Alice in Shroomland The Card Game (2-4 Players). <br/> Cooperative Game Mode (Approximately 2 - 3 Hours): In Cooperative game mode Players control Characters called Trippers (the good guys). Players work together and take turns moving their Trippers around the open game board to enter flipped down areas called Dimensions. Dimensions contain lurking Evildoers (the not as nice guys).  These Evildoers must be defeated!!! They are trying to ruin the trips and fun of Shroomland's denizens!<br/><br/>Next comes battle. When all Trippers who intend to engage in battle are ready, the Tripper calls out &quot;I'm ready to Trip!&quot; When this is done, all entrances and exits to the dimension seal and battle commences until all Evildoers or all Trippers in that dimension have been defeated! A defeated Character is called &quot;Unfortunately Sober.&rdquo; After 3 turns, Unfortunately Sober Trippers return to The Rabbit Hole which is in the center of the game map.  After all Evildoers in the dimension are defeated, each Player gets treasure. Evildoers do not come back after being made Unfortunately Sober.<br/><br/>This process of traversing the map and defeating Evildoers is completed until Players reach The Dark Forest.  The Evil Magic Mushroom Leader resides in The Dark Forest.  This is the final battle!  Lose against The Evil Magic Mushroom Leader and the game is lost.<br/><br/>A few things to note: <br/> - The Dimension tiles are drawn randomly so every time you play is a different board layout. <br/> - Each Dimension has a random &quot;What's Here&quot; card. It contains the number of Evildoers in the dimension, who controls the evildoers in the dimension, the number of treasures each Player receives after battle, and the random Dimension effect affecting the dimension, which could be either beneficial or hindering to the Trippers and Evildoers. <br/> - Players gain additional Trippers as they adventure Shroomland.  These Trippers are hiding!  Traverse Shroomland to find them all! <br/> - Power-ups and curses are found while adventuring Shroomland. They help or hinder a Character. Some permanently increase the number of dice rolled to attack, others reduce Trip Speed, along with other effects.<br/> - Magical Shroom Effects only affect the Characters YOU control. If you cause it, you deal with it!  <br/> Competitive Game Mode (Approximately 1 - 2 Hours): In competitive game mode, Players control BOTH Trippers and Evildoers on an open game board collecting mushrooms throughout Shroomland.  Each Dimension a Player ends their turn in yields mushrooms.  The first Player to 80 Magical Shrooms wins!  But watch out! Battle between Players occurs and it is either you or them! Who&rsquo;s it gonna be?<br/><br/>A few things to note: <br/> -    After (3) turns, Unfortunately Sober Characters do not return until a &quot;Freshen Up&quot; card is played. <br/> -    The Magical Shroom Shop is open and ready for business! You can expend mushroom tokens in this shop to buy additional Characters, Curses, Power-ups, Curse Removals, Freshen Ups (Revives), etc. <br/> -    Magical Shroom Effects affect the Characters YOU choose. If you cause it, you deal it! Backstabbing at its finest!<br/><br/>Alice in Shroomland The Card Game (Approximately 30 - 45 Minutes):  In Alice in Shroomland The Card Game, Players go head to head trying to destroy opposing Players' Magical Shroom supplies!  But hurry!  At the end of each Player's turn, they will discard a Magical Shroom Token.  It's a race against the clock!<br/><br/>A few things to note:<br/> - Players begin the game with 20 Magical Shroom Tokens.  These Shrooms are protected by Trippers and Evildoers.  Don't leave your defenses open!<br/><br/>- If you end your turn with 0 Magical Shrooms, you lose the game!<br/> - At the end of each Player's turn, that Player discards a Magical Shroom token.<br/> - Players control BOTH Trippers and Evildoers.<br/> - Each turn could mean the difference between winning and losing.  Luck and strategy are EQUALLY important in this game mode!<br/> - Players are able to buy from the Shroom Shop!  Be careful!  You only begin with 20 Magical Shrooms.  Spend them wisely!<br/> - The same game components that are used in the Cooperative and Competitive game modes are what is used for Alice in Shroomland The Card Game.  No need to buy additional game components to play!<br/><br/>What&rsquo;s included in Alice in Shroomland???<br/><br/>The components of Alice in Shroomland include:<br/><br/>(2) Alice in Shroomland game boards<br/>(6) Boss Dimension Tiles <br/>(16) Fun Dimension Tiles <br/>(12) Tripper Stat Tiles<br/>(24) Tripper Level Up Double-Sided Stat Tiles <br/>(8) Boss Evildoer Stat Tiles <br/>(40) Fun Evildoer Stat Cards <br/>(4) Curse Cards <br/>(30) Magical Shroom Effect Cards <br/>(21) What&rsquo;s Here Cards <br/>(72) Treasure Cards <br/>(60) Character Standees <br/>(40) Green Trip Duration Tokens of 1&rsquo;s, 5&rsquo;s, and 10&rsquo;s <br/>(40) Purple Magical Mushroom Tokens of 1&rsquo;s, 5&rsquo;s, and 10&rsquo;s<br/>(51) Green and Yellow Temporary Power-up Tokens<br/>(4) Double-Sided Tiles (1 side lists out the turn phases for all 3 Game Modes and the other side lists which Characters are powered up in each Dimension).<br/>(1) Rule Set<br/>(1) Set of 8 Custom-made jade green Mushroom Dice with golden Mischievous Mushrooms representing the 1&rsquo;s on the Dice.<br/><br/>What does my Character get to do???<br/><br/>(Use an image of The Sly Cheshire Cat Stat Tile as an example)<br/>How to read a Character Stat Tile:<br/><br/>Trip Duration is a representation of &quot;Health&quot;. Every time a Character takes damage they add (1) Trip Duration Token by the amount of damage dealt. A Character who reaches the Trip Duration listed on their Stat Tile becomes Unfortunately Sober. The Sly Chesire Cat can take 6 points of damage before she becomes Unfortunately Sober.<br/><br/>Trip Speed is a representation of how many actions a Character can take on their turn. Trip Speed resets on a Character's next turn.  The Sly Cheshire Cat can take 1 action on her turn.<br/><br/>- Each Character may perform (1) of (5) available actions on their turn.  Each action costs (1) Trip Speed. They can either:    <br/> (1) Move. Each Character has a &ldquo;Trip Speed&rdquo; which is the number of spaces a Character can move each turn.  <br/> (2) Brutally Attack. A Character may attack an adjacent Character. This is done by rolling the custom made mushroom dice, calculating the total, and subtracting this from the Character&rsquo;s current Trip Duration. A Character with (0) Trip Duration is Unfortunately Sober. The mushroom dice scores are Mushroom = (2) points, 3 or 5 = (1) point, and 2, 4, and 6 = (0) points.<br/>  <br/>(3) Use a Magical Shroom Ability. Each Character has a special power that they can expend mushroom tokens to use. Players start out with a set number of mushroom tokens and find more in treasure chests by adventuring Shroomland and defeating Evildoers. Tripping is unpredictable. It could be the best or worst experience of their life! Each player needs to draw a number of Magical Shroom Ability Effects after using their Magical Shroom Ability. They range from healing, to teleporting, to making Trippers unfortunately sober. Do you dare to shroom?  <br/> (4) Move. Sightseeing is fun! Go visit another Dimension!  <br/> (5) Do nothing. Simply chill and do nothing.<br/><br/>Brutal Attack is a representation of how many dice a Character rolls when attacking a Character. The Sly Cheshire Cat rolls 2 Brutality Dice while attacking a Character.<br/><br/>Magical Shroom Ability is, as with real mushroom tripping, a personality trait that is amplified when a Character consumes Magical Mushrooms. The Sly Cheshire Cat's Magical Shroom Ability is called &quot;Where did I go?&quot;  This means that when The Sly Cheshire Cat activates her special ability, she turn invisible and take no damage until her next turn.  While invisible she can also attack a Character.<br/> Magical Shroom Ability Cost is a representation of how many Magical Mushrooms a Character must consume (discard) to activate their special ability. Players start out with Magical Mushrooms (different for each game mode) and gain more the further they traverse Shroomland. When The Sly Cheshire Cat activates &quot;Where did I go?&quot; the Player controlling The Sly Cheshire Cat must discard 2 of the Magical Mushrooms that they have.<br/><br/>Magical Shroom Ability Effects is a representation of how many Magical Shroom Ability Effects cards a Character draws when activating their Magical Shroom Ability. As with real mushroom tripping, tripping in Shroomland is unpredictable. These cards have beneficial and hindering effects. The Sly Cheshire Cat must draw 3 Magical Shroom Ability Effect Cards whenever she activates her &quot;Where did I go?&quot;!<br/><br/>Level Up:  All 12 Trippers (The Nice Characters) are able to level up in any game mode (up to Level 5) at the cost of (5) Magical Mushrooms each time they level up.  Leveling up a Character changes that Characters current Stat Tile to a more powerful Character Stat Tile.<br/><br/>(Use the image of all The Denizens of Shroomland)<br/>Meet The Denizens of Shroomland!<br/><br/>It wouldn't be a party without guests! Meet the denizens of Shroomland!<br/><br/>There are 24 different Characters inhabiting Shroomland.  Of these 24 Different Characters, the 12 Trippers are able to level up from Level 1 to Level 5.<br/><br/>Trippers (the good guys) include: <br/> The Beguiling Alice - Although dimwitted, she loves to adventure. She enjoys running into unknown areas of Shroomland called &quot;Dimensions&quot; without thinking first. Wait, where did she go? I was just introducing her and she's already gone. Oh! She's over chewing on a boulder. I'll go get her. <br/> The Insane Mad Hatter - Does he really need an introduction with a name like that? He can really take a beating since he can heal himself. Who knew ingesting arsenic for so many years would come in handy for this guy. <br/> The Sly Cheshire Cat - A cat like no other. Enjoys laying in trees, playing with butterflies, and occasionally turning invisible to attack unsuspecting Evildoers. He'll really claw your eyes out if you get on his bad side. <br/> The Pure White Rabbit - The fastest Character in the Shroomland. The Tart Queen has toughened him up over the years which has caused him to learn how to create a magical damage-absorbing shield. <br/> The Tart Queen - Don't mess with this lady! She gets what she wants, when she wants it! Period! <br/> The Tiny Little King - I don't know what he sees in her, but this is The Tart Queen's husband. While very... petite, he controls an army of Mischievous Mushrooms to do his bidding. <br/> The So Stoned Caterpillar - He's off in his own little world. In fact, he hardly moves at all. He is so in tune with his own mind that he can telepathically attack any Character from anywhere in Shroomland. <br/> The Wingman March Hare - This guy has game! He's up for anything and just goes with the flow. You'll see what I mean when you activate his special ability. <br/> The Drunk Dormouse - The exact definition of a lush. He may be tiny, but you would be surprised how strong this little guy can become after having a few too many cocktails! <br/> The Flightless Dodo - While he may not be able to fly, that hasn't stopped this ambitious bird from soaring to the top! Watch out! He lays egg bombs and knows exactly how to throw them! <br/> The Badass Duchess - Nobody ever gives this woman any credit! She picks up after the spoiled Obnoxiously Whining Baby! If she can handle that and put up with The Tart Queen, then she can surely take down some Evildoers... and if she doesn't want to deal with them, then she can just use her awesome black arts skills to curse Evildoers and let someone else deal with them. <br/> The Obnoxiously Whining Baby - Have I said enough? If you are near him, his deafening cry will not only paralyze you, but will also make your eardrums bleed.<br/><br/>Junior Evildoers  (the weak bad guys) include:<br/><br/>An Unbelievably Fake Chair - Did that chair just move?  Watch out!  This chair throws splinters at passerby's.<br/><br/>A Mischievous Mushroom - These little guys are the minions of The Evil Magic Mushroom Leader.  Wherever these little scamps go, magic surely happens.<br/><br/>A Scandalous Oyster - Just one look at these little cuties and you will lay down your weapons... or at least that's what they want you to do.  Talk about a bait and switch... pun intended!<br/><br/>A Smelly Flower - After you realize your companion didn't fart you'll realize your in danger.  These flowers pack a powerful and toxic stench.<br/><br/>Boss Evildoers (the really strong bad guys) include:<br/><br/>The Cannibal Cook - He would love to have you over for dinner... literally.  The Cannibal Cook enjoys throwing pepper at anything that moves.  When the victim starts sneezing uncontrollably is when he makes his move.<br/><br/>The Ninnyhammer Tweedledee and The Ninnyhammer Tweedledumb - Twin brothers to eachother, and 30 seconds apart.  The two brothers have grown up and walked different paths through life.  One brother has become a bonafide healer using reason over strength while the other brother smashes everything in sight while focusing on strength over reason.<br/><br/>The Tart Queen's Ugly Reflection - Okay I have to admit if I were stuck in a mirror with The Tart Queen all day I would probably be Evil too!  Don't get too close!  The Tart Queen's Ugly Reflection can swap bodies with her victims.<br/><br/>The Vapid Daisy Sister - One of three unique sisters, The Vapid Daisy Sister is the youngest of her sisters and is also dumber than a rock.  However, her cheerful personalty makes up for what she lacks in brain power.<br/><br/>The Vapid Rose Sister - The second of three sister, The Vapid Rose Sister is a seductress like none seen before.  She lures her partners in with her curvaceous appeals until within her grasps and then lets loose with her thorns.<br/><br/>The Vapid Tiger Lily Sister - The third of three sisters, The Vapid Tiger Lily Sister knows what she wants and takes it!  She is able to rally followers and take what she wants by force.<br/><br/>The Evil Magic Mushroom Leader - The Evil Magic Mushroom Leader is the unofficial Evil King of Shroomland.  Nothing happens in Shroomland that he doesn't know about.  He has the power to release spores causing any Characters nearby to instantaneously trip.<br/><br/>LET THE PARTY BEGIN!!!<br/><br/>"}, "202592": {"rpgartist": ["Cristi Balanescu", "Caroline Gariba", "Skott Kilander", "Lucasfilm Ltd.", "Mike Nash", "Ryan Valle", "Ben Zweifel"], "rpgitemversion": ["English first edition"], "statistics": [], "name": "Star Wars: The Force Awakens \u2013 Beginner Game", "rpgdesigner": ["Tim Flanders", "Corey Konieczka", "Sam Stewart"], "rpgproducer": ["David Ardila", "Chris Beck", "John Britton", "Andrew Christensen", "Christine Crabb", "Megan Duehn", "Edge Studio", "Simone Elliot", "Jason Glawe", "Amanda Greenhart", "Michael Hurley", "David Johnson", "Andrew Navaro", "Duane Nichols", "Christian T.

When any player has six or fewer tokens in their supply, each player takes two more turns, then the game ends. At that point, if they've created a continuous path between the two cities on a ticket, then they score the points on that ticket; if not, then they lose points instead.<br/><br/>Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails puts a few twists on the TtR formula, starting with split card decks of trains and ships (with all of the wild cards going in the train deck). Three cards of each type are revealed at the start of the game, and when you draw cards, you replace them with a card from whichever deck you like. (Shuffle the card types separately to form new decks when needed.)<br/><br/>Similarly, players choose their own mix of train and ship tokens at the start of the game. To claim a train route (rectangular spaces), you must play train cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with train tokens, and to claim a ship route (oval spaces), you must play ship cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with ship tokens. Ship cards depict one or two ships on them, and when you play a double-ship card, you can cover one or two ship spaces. You can take an action during play to swap train tokens for ships (or vice versa), and you lose one point for each token you swap.<br/><br/>Some tickets show tour routes with multiple cities instead of simply two cities. If you build a network that matches the tour exactly, you score more points than if you simply include all of those cities in your network.<br/><br/>Each player also starts the game with three harbors. If you have built a route to a port city, you can take an action during the game to place a harbor in that city (with a limit of one harbor per port). To place the harbor, you must discard two train cards and two ship cards of the same color, all of which must bear the harbor symbol (an anchor). At the end of the game, you lose four points for each harbor not placed, and you gain 10-40 points for each placed harbor depending on how many of your completed tickets show that port city.<br/><br/>Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails includes a double-sided game board, with one side showing the world and the other side showing the Great Lakes of North America.

GMs can deploy them as ready-made NPCs to use as either allies or rivals. Players can use them any time they need a character to play on short notice.

Factions gain prestige points by successfully leveraging the strengths of their senators, political opportunities, senatorial influence, and treasuries as they engage in various aspects of Roman politics.  Prestige is earned by being elected to high office, success in war, sponsoring public games, earning nobility, enacting justice, and persuading other senators to join their faction.  Prestige can also be lost through military failures and by being convicted of corruption.  Victory is declared when one senator or faction has gained sufficient prestige as to be crowned the First Emperor of Rome.<br/><br/>However, success will require both competition and cooperation as all factions must work together to ensure the stability of Rome.  Failures of the Senate and unmet public demand will increase civil unrest, leading to revolt.  Excessive war involvement will overextend Rome&rsquo;s military resources.  Spending more funds than what is available will bankrupt the State Treasury.  Any of these situations will ensure the fall of Rome causing all players to lose the game.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, actions are numerically resolved using senators&rsquo; individual attributes, shared State resources, faction resources, and dice.  Primary mechanics include probability modification, resource management, and blind bidding.  The game is played over a number of rounds until a victory condition is met or until all players are defeated by the game.  Each round is made up of six distinct phases, played in the following order:<br/><br/>Election Phase:  <br/>Each player nominates a candidate from their faction to compete for office.  The candidates with the most votes (prestige + bribes) are elected to the offices of Consul and Censor.  The Consuls will co-lead Rome in political and military affairs while the Censor will be responsible to convict members of the Senate accused of corruption.  Minor offices are also assigned to other senators who may also sponsor public games from their faction treasuries to earn prestige and to placate the public.<br/><br/>Senate Phase:  <br/>Senators gather to make decisions related to Rome&rsquo;s resources.  Each resource (gold and legions) is distributed proportionally to all factions based upon the relative number of senators in each faction.  Each faction then applies gold to various &ldquo;proposals&rdquo; such as the purchase of Public Grain or the raising of additional Legions.  Each faction applies available legions to the wars of their choosing.  Consuls choose which armies to lead into battle.  But beware&mdash;an &lsquo;Assassin&rsquo; or &lsquo;Mob Incitement&rsquo; card in the hands of a jealous senator can severely upset the balance of senatorial power.<br/><br/>Republic Phase:  <br/>Factions take turns making decisions and resolving actions related to their senators working throughout the Republic.  Players may choose to have certain senators engage in corruption to gain funds for their faction treasuries.  Auxiliary legions may be hired by governors to enhance provincial defenses.  Senators in Rome may also attempt to persuade senators to join their faction by the subtle application of personal prestige, ideological attraction, and bribery.  Rome must also respond to random events such as public demands, barbarian raids, provincial insurrection, and plagues.<br/><br/>War Phase:  <br/>Wars are now resolved.  If victorious, the general returns to Rome with additional prestige and the potential of war spoils.  A stalemate will cause the general to return to Rome having lost prestige due to eroding public confidence.  A defeat will end in death for the general, an increase in public unrest, and the affected province being overrun.  Victorious generals also have the option of &ldquo;crossing the Rubicon&rdquo; to engage in civil war with the Roman State in an attempt to secure an early win.<br/><br/>Trial Phase:  <br/>The Censor will prosecute corruption charges of the Senate.  For each successful conviction, the Censor gains additional prestige while the accused may either lose prestige or (in the case of murder or treason) be executed.<br/><br/>Intersession Phase:  <br/>Senators may die randomly of natural causes.  For those senators who survive the mortality roll, victory conditions are checked.  Victory is declared when one faction&rsquo;s senator has earned 12 prestige points or when a faction has accumulated a total of 30 prestige points.  Otherwise, the game is reset for the next round of play.<br/><br/>Imperium:  From Republic to Empire was designed to be a simplified, less time-consuming alternative to Republic of Rome (Avalon Hill, 1990; Valley Games).<br/><br/>"}, "202726": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Michela Coletto", "Valentino Sergi"], "average": "4.5", "poll": [], "name": "Suicidium", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Player Elimination", "Take That"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3125719_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Felinia", "Davide La Rosa", "Miguel \u00c1ngel Mart\u00edn", "Tuono Pettinato", "Marco Tonus"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Officina Meningi"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3125719.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Humor", "Mature / Adult", "Party Game"], "age": "18", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Suicidium is a captivating, grim and funny card-game.

Each player has wine, poison and antidote tokens they can pour into the goblets, trying to poison their enemies while staying alive themselves! Each noble also has a special ability that allows them to bend or even break a rule.<br/><br/>In more detail, each character has a plastic goblet, and each goblet is primed in secret at the start of the round with either wine, poison or antidote. On a turn, you take two actions, with actions being to peek inside your goblet, rotate all goblets left or right, swap your goblet with someone else's, or secretly add one of your wine, poison or antidote tokens to any goblet. Once someone has &quot;served&quot; all of their wine, they can call a toast on their turn instead of doing anything else. Each player, including the toaster, takes one more action, then everyone drinks. If you have more poison than antidote, you die.<br/><br/>What's your goal in doing all of this? Well, at the start of a round you are given a target to kill, and everyone knows who is targeting whom. If at the end of a round, your target is dead, you score 1 point; if you're alive, you score 1 point; if both of these things are true, you score a bonus point (3 total).

As part of our Strategic Decision Series of games, this is a game of skill for two players - there are no random events. Yet, each game is amazingly different from the others - this is because the two players focus their attention on the most crucial decisions, and there are many to be made! USA and CSA troops are scaled from brigades to corps, plus state militias. Forts, naval/riverine and leader counters (army, some corps) are included.<br/><br/>Players are limited to a fixed number of actions per turn - early, the Confederacy gets the most Command Points (actions), later in the war the Union does. Use the Command Points to move leaders - army commanders who can move the armies they're with - or to move individual units which usually move more quickly by themselves. Or use the Command Points to build your defensive works.<br/>    There are six turns per year: Winter (Dec-Apr), May, June, July-Aug15, Aug16-Sept, and Oct-Nov. These time frames were selected because the 135 most important civil war battles are spread equally across them.<br/>    Reinforcements and leader arrival/departure occurs each turn, and replacements are spread out across each combatant's territories - but the Union gets 11 replacements per turn, while the South gets 7. These 7 are spread among the 7 groups of key (&quot;Flag&quot;) cities, which are grouped from the Trans-Mississippi, the Mississippi River, Alabama, Tennessee/Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia. As the Union player takes the Flag Cities in each group, CSA replacements decline.<br/><br/>The Confederacy, however, can make a lightning strike into the North, either shooting for Washington DC or other targets which can end the war and the game immediately, or warrant intervention on their behalf from France and Britain.<br/><br/>Movement is point-to-point and is affected by weather and terrain. Access to the rivers and seas gives the Union a significant bonus and the CSA another headache. Sea and river invasions are a staple of Union attacks, but are expensive to conduct and limited in number. <br/>    Leaders permit large army movements, but also heavily affect combat, increasing unit effectiveness and reducing losses. Combat is dice-less, based on our algorithms of civil war combat, in which terrain, weather, force size, and leadership all play a role. The biggest army doesn't always win, nor does the one with the best leader!  <br/>    The Union Navy threatens all the Confederate ports with blockades and invasions, but the CSA's ironclads can block them. The CSA also relies on fortifications to help out, and once these get big the Union must slowly (and expensively) reduce them to force the rebels out.<br/><br/>Political events are included: Missouri, Kentucky and West Virginia all have special considerations. Early occupation of these can provide bonuses to the Confederacy, or deny the Union additional troops.<br/><br/>Scenarios starting in 1862 and 1863 are also included.<br/><br/>"}}
