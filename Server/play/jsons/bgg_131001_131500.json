Des fronti&egrave;res de l'Oregon au Rio Grande, la Californie rec&egrave;le bon nombre de villes, recoins et paysages vari&eacute;s : autant de nouveaux terrains d'enqu&ecirc;te pour la division COPS.<br/><br/>Comme &agrave; l'accoutum&eacute;e, ce suppl&eacute;ment comprend son lot de nouvelles ainsi que quelques encarts faisant &eacute;voluer l'univers de jeu. La 1&egrave;re saison avait vu l'&eacute;lection du maire de Los Angeles, les &eacute;lecteurs se sont prononc&eacute;s cette fois-ci pour les si&egrave;ges de Pr&eacute;sident de la R&eacute;publique et de Gouverneur de l'&eacute;tat californien. Il est &agrave; noter que chacune des descriptions ci-dessous se fait au travers du regard d'un personnage (policier, agent de l'office de tourisme, journaliste, etc.) de sorte que certains passages m&ecirc;lent tout autant r&eacute;cit et explications.<br/>Le premier &quot;nouveau territoire&quot; &eacute;voqu&eacute; est San Francisco, l'autre ville phare de la Californie avec Los Angeles. R&eacute;put&eacute;e pour sa communaut&eacute; artistique, son calme, sa propret&eacute; et son quartier chinois historique, Frisco peut appara&icirc;tre comme un havre de paix aux yeux des policiers angelinos, mais c'est oublier qu'il faut toujours se m&eacute;fier des eaux stagnantes, comme le rappellent les silhouettes des c&eacute;l&egrave;bres p&eacute;nitenciers d'Alcatraz et de Saint Quentin. Les quartiers les plus signicatifs de la ville sont pass&eacute;s au crible les uns apr&egrave;s les autres, avec une version &eacute;dulcor&eacute;e destin&eacute;e aux joueurs et une version beaucoup moins idyllique en fin d'ouvrage, pour les MJ. &Ccedil;&agrave; et l&agrave;, on pourra &eacute;galement trouver quelques consid&eacute;rations et renseignements compl&eacute;mentaires sur le r&eacute;seau de transport municipal, sur les fameuses collines de Frisco et sur sa p&eacute;riph&eacute;rie, avec des voisins c&eacute;l&egrave;bres comme Berkeley et la Silicon Valley.<br/><br/>Pour la deuxi&egrave;me &eacute;tape, retour dans le secteur de Los Angeles, avec le proche Comt&eacute; d'Orange. Bastion des nostalgiques de l'Union et des r&eacute;fractaires de l'ind&eacute;pendance, Orange regroupe une vaste population blanche et ais&eacute;e prot&eacute;g&eacute;e par une police sur&eacute;quip&eacute;e aux allures de force arm&eacute;e. La police est d'ailleurs un sujet br&ucirc;lant car entre services du sh&eacute;rif, polices priv&eacute;es et &quot;&eacute;l&eacute;ments ext&eacute;rieurs&quot; tels que le COPS ou les agences f&eacute;d&eacute;rales, la concurrence est de mise, au point que les coups fourr&eacute;s se multiplient. Cette section insiste sur la psychologie des habitants, leurs convictions politiques et religieuses et &agrave; la r&eacute;partition des forces de police - en sachant qu'ici la couleur de peau est un facteur essentiel en mati&egrave;re d'arrestations.<br/><br/>La troisi&egrave;me &eacute;tape est une succession de &quot;cartes postales&quot; pittoresques, regroup&eacute;es sous le nom de &quot;Rural County&quot;, paysages de l'arri&egrave;re-pays de la R&eacute;publique, &agrave; l'&eacute;cart des grandes &eacute;tendues urbaines auxquelles les cops sont habitu&eacute;s.<br/><br/>     Monterey, charmante petite ville baln&eacute;aire, reconnue pour son attrait tant culturel que touristique <br/>     EDEN, consortium alimentaire b&acirc;ti sur l'une des plus vieilles cornes d'abondance californiennes : les agrumes <br/>     les exploitations viticoles, rendues mondialement c&eacute;l&egrave;bres par les crus de la Napa Valley<br/>     les plaines glac&eacute;es de l'Alaska, o&ugrave; les conditions de vie et d'enqu&ecirc;te n&eacute;cessitent une adaptation aussi solide que rapide <br/>     la fronti&egrave;re nord avec l'Union, dont la population rurale et ses us et coutumes ont de quoi offrir une douche froide &agrave; l'habitant sophistiqu&eacute; de LA <br/>     et enfin Barbertown, ville champignon b&acirc;tie de bric et de broc dans les &eacute;tendues du d&eacute;sert Mojave, &agrave; l'&eacute;cart de toute loi.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>La quatri&egrave;me &eacute;tape &quot;Hauts lieux californiens&quot; suit les p&eacute;r&eacute;grinations d'un policier du LAPD aux m&eacute;thodes plus que muscl&eacute;es entich&eacute; d'une prostitu&eacute;e, au travers du territoire de la R&eacute;publique.<br/><br/>     Point de d&eacute;part, Tijuana, ville frontali&egrave;re mexicaine connue de tous les f&ecirc;tards et fugitifs californiens <br/>     passage &eacute;clair par la ville portuaire de San Diego <br/>     remont&eacute;e vers le nord, dans le comt&eacute; de Santa Barbara, aux mains des polices priv&eacute;es du consortium EAGLE <br/>     fuite vers la Vall&eacute;e de la Mort et les vastes r&eacute;serves indiennes du Nevada <br/>     &eacute;vasion vers une plate-forme de l'Alaska <br/>     et enfin d&eacute;nouement &agrave; Hawa&iuml;.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Retour &agrave; l'agglom&eacute;ration de Los Angeles pour la suite, avec deux monuments locaux.<br/><br/>     Le parc Disney, d&eacute;sert&eacute; par ses propri&eacute;taires lors de l'ind&eacute;pendance, et aujourd'hui recouvert d'une flore aussi luxuriante que dangereuse suite &agrave; des attentats perp&eacute;tr&eacute;s par des terroristes &eacute;cologistes, o&ugrave; militaires et biologistes veillent d&eacute;sormais au grain.<br/>     Le Bharat Mall, point central de la communaut&eacute; indo-pakistanaise nich&eacute;e &agrave; Skid Row. Si l'ex-centre commercial est ouvert &agrave; chacun le jour afin d'y m&eacute;diter en paix, la nuit il devient autrement moins accueillant, si ce n'est imp&eacute;n&eacute;trable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Fin du parcours avec Las Vegas, surnomm&eacute;e &quot;Show City&quot; dans le meilleur des cas, &quot;Sin City&quot; dans celui oppos&eacute;. Rong&eacute;e de longue date par le crime et la corruption, la ville dispose d'une police &agrave; l'avenant, au point que les services de s&eacute;curit&eacute; priv&eacute;s ont totalement &eacute;clips&eacute; celle-ci &agrave; l'exception du SWAT et de la brigade scientifique, seules unit&eacute;s &agrave; redorer le blason du LVPD. Cette section met l'accent sur la description de la police locale, sur la mafia &agrave; la t&ecirc;te de la ville, sur les in&eacute;vitables casinos qui pars&egrave;ment l'art&egrave;re du Strip, sur les attractions locales plus ou moins sanglantes ainsi que sur la p&eacute;riph&eacute;rie de la ville. L&agrave; encore, on peut suivre l'enqu&ecirc;te d'un d&eacute;tective du LAPD un peu trop curieux que l'on retrouvera d'ailleurs au fond du Lac Mead. Voil&agrave; une fois encore du pain sur la planche pour le COPS.<br/><br/>La seconde partie du suppl&eacute;ment regroupe un total de cinq enqu&ecirc;tes : un 10-18 accompagn&eacute; de quatre sc&eacute;narios complets.<br/><br/>     Halloween sanglant : ce 10-18 voit des remous agiter la mafia italienne, tandis que les n&eacute;o-corl&eacute;onnais entendent bien faire le m&eacute;nage dans leurs rangs, voire &agrave; l'ext&eacute;rieur.<br/>     La tour d'ivoire : et si le jeu de r&ocirc;le rendait bel et bien fou ? Suite &agrave; l'immolation par le feu d'une adolescente, les cops devront s'immiscer dans le domaine des jeux vid&eacute;o online, le tout avec l'aide d'une coll&egrave;gue aux id&eacute;es politiques quelque peu d&eacute;rangeantes.<br/>     Endgame : ce sc&eacute;nario r&eacute;v&egrave;le l'une des facettes les moins louables de la jeune R&eacute;publique de Californie, alors qu'une unit&eacute; de barbouzes autrefois commandit&eacute;e par l'arm&eacute;e et envoy&eacute;e volontairement &agrave; la mort refait surface, pr&ecirc;te &agrave; tout pour se venger. Les cops auront une posture bien d&eacute;licate, coinc&eacute;s entre militaires et commandos.<br/>     Le sommeil de la raison : confront&eacute;s &agrave; une s&eacute;rie d'homicides dans le milieu m&eacute;dical, et &agrave; la veille d'un attentat terroriste de grande ampleur sur Los Angeles, les cops auront l'occasion de lever le voile sur le scandale du Gob', le smog verd&acirc;tre qui empeste r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement la conurbation.<br/>     Non coupable : les cops devront marcher sur des oeufs lorsqu'un d&eacute;p&ocirc;t de plainte pour viol laisse appara&icirc;tre bon nombre d'&eacute;tranget&eacute;s. D&egrave;s lors &agrave; qui faire confiance, &agrave; la victime ou au violeur pr&eacute;sum&eacute; ?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>La troisi&egrave;me et derni&egrave;re partie offre la v&eacute;rit&eacute; et des renseignements compl&eacute;mentaires au MJ quant aux lieux d&eacute;crits pr&eacute;c&eacute;demment. De m&ecirc;me, certains encarts permettent de faire avancer l'&eacute;volution de l'univers, en donnant le nom des futurs &eacute;lus aux plus hauts postes de la R&eacute;publique. Ce chapitre insiste avant tout sur les personnalit&eacute;s des diff&eacute;rentes villes, qu'elles appartiennent &agrave; l'administration, &agrave; la police ou au crime organis&eacute;. Ce sera &eacute;galement l'occasion de d&eacute;couvrir ce qui se cache derri&egrave;re le succ&egrave;s florissant des entreprises de l'Imperial Valley et des casinos de Vegas : le r&ecirc;ve californien n'est pas exempt de d&eacute;fauts. Quelques surprises sont &eacute;galement au rendez-vous, avec le nom du nouveau Roi des Singes ainsi qu'un certain... Walt Disney.<br/><br/><br/>Translation courtesy of Google:<br/><br/>The California dream, it is of course the golden beaches of Malibu, Hollywood studios and prestigious Burbank, cobbled streets of Sunset Boulevard star and glass towers of Downtown LA - but remember that the Golden State is not limited to the megalopolis angelino ... Oregon border to the Rio Grande, California contains many cities, nooks and varied landscapes: many new areas of investigation for the division PSC.<br/>As usual, this supplement includes a lot of new and some inserts by changing the game world The first season saw the election of the mayor of Los Angeles, voters voted this time for seats of President and Governor of the State of California. It should be noted that each of the following descriptions is through the eyes of a character (police officer, tourist office, journalist, etc..) So that certain passages mixed equally and narrative explanations.<br/><br/>The first &quot;new territory&quot; referred to is San Francisco, another key city in California with Los Angeles. Renowned for its artistic community, its calm, its cleanliness and historic Chinatown, Frisco may appear as a haven of peace in the eyes of police Angelinos, but remember that you should always be wary of stagnant water, as recalled silhouettes of famous penitentiary Alcatraz and San Quentin. More meaningful neighborhoods of the city are screened one after the other, with a watered down version for players and much less idyllic version endnotes for MJ. Here and there, we can also find some additional information and considerations on municipal transit on the famous hills of Frisco and its periphery, with famous neighbors like Berkeley and Silicon Valley.<br/><br/>For the second step, back in the Los Angeles area, with the nearest Orange County. Bastion nostalgic Union and refractory independence, Orange white population includes a wide and easily protected by a police-like over-equipped armed forces. The police is also a hot topic since services between the sheriff, private police and &quot;external factors&quot; such as the PSC or federal agencies, competition is required, so that the dirty tricks multiply. This section focuses on the psychology of people, their political and religious beliefs and the distribution of police - knowing that here the skin color is an essential factor in arrests.<br/><br/>The third step is a series of &quot;postcards&quot; picturesque, grouped under the name of &quot;Rural County&quot; landscapes of the hinterland of the Republic, away from large urban sprawls which the cops are accustomed. <br/><br/>     Monterey charming little seaside town, known for its tourist attractions both cultural <br/>     EDEN, food consortium built on one of the oldest cornucopias California: citrus <br/>     the vineyards, made \u200b\u200bby the world famous vineyards of the Napa Valley <br/>     the frozen plains of Alaska, where living conditions survey and require adaptation as robust as fast <br/>     the northern border with the Union, including the rural population and its customs have something to offer a cold shower the inhabitant of LA sophisticated <br/>     and finally Barbertown, boomtown built of odds and ends in the wilds of the Mojave Desert, away from any law.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The fourth step &quot;Meccas California&quot; follows the journey of a policeman LAPD methods than muscular infatuated with a prostitute, through the territory of the Republic. <br/><br/>     Starting point, Tijuana, Mexican border city known to all revelers and fugitives California <br/>     brief passage by the port city of San Diego <br/>     rise to the north, in the county of Santa Barbara, in the hands of private police consortium EAGLE <br/>     escape to Death Valley and the vast Indian reservations in Nevada <br/>     escape into a platform of Alaska <br/>     and finally ending in Hawaii.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Back to Greater Los Angeles later two local monuments. <br/><br/>     The Disney deserted by its owners after independence, and now covered with lush flora and dangerous as a result of attacks by terrorists ecologists, biologists ensure that military and now the grain. <br/>     The Bharat Mall, the central point of the Indo-Pakistani community nestled on Skid Row. If the former mall is open each day to meditate in peace at night otherwise it becomes less welcoming, if not impenetrable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>End of the course with Las Vegas, nicknamed &quot;City Show&quot; in the best case, &quot;Sin City&quot; in the opposite direction. Long plagued by crime and corruption, the city has a policy to match, to the extent that private security services have eclipsed it with the exception of SWAT brigade and science, only units to restore the prestige of LVPD. This section focuses on the description of the local police, the mafia at the head of the city, the inevitable casinos dotting the artery of the Strip, on local attractions and more or less bloody than on the periphery of the city. Again, you can follow the investigation of a detective from the LAPD a little too curious that we find elsewhere in the bottom of Lake Mead. Here again the cut out for the PSC.<br/><br/>The second part of the supplement includes a total of five surveys: a 10-18 with four complete scenarios. <br/><br/>     Bloody Halloween: it sees 10-18 whirlpool shake the Italian mafia, while the neo-corl&eacute;onnais along well to clean their ranks, even outside. <br/>     The ivory tower and if the role play made \u200b\u200bindeed crazy? Following the self-immolation of a teenager, the cops will get involved in the field of video games online, all with the help of a fellow political ideas somewhat disturbing. <br/>     Endgame: This scenario reveals one of the least commendable facets of the young Republic of California, then a unit of spooks formerly sponsored by the army and sent voluntarily to death surfaced, desperate for revenge. The cops have a very delicate position, caught between military commandos. <br/>     The sleep of reason: faced with a series of killings in the medical field, and on the eve of a major terrorist attack on Los Angeles, cops have the opportunity to uncover the scandal Gob, smog greenish smelly regularly conurbation. <br/>     Not guilty: the cops have to walk on eggshells when a complaint for rape reveals many of oddities. Therefore who to trust, to the victim or the alleged perpetrator?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The third and last part of the truth and offer additional information to DOJ regarding the locations described above. Similarly, some inserts can advance the evolution of the universe, giving the name of the future elected to the highest offices of the Republic. This chapter focuses primarily on the personalities of the different cities, they belong to the administration, the police and organized crime. This will also be the opportunity to discover what lies behind the success of the business flourishing Imperial Valley and Vegas casinos: the California dream is not without its faults. Some surprises are waiting for you with the name of the new Monkey King as well as a ...

La trame du jeu se d&eacute;veloppe encore un plus avec les &eacute;lections pr&eacute;sidentielles, qui marquent un passage &agrave; droite avec l'arriv&eacute;e au pouvoir du R&eacute;publicain Kevin Sutter. Mais loin de l'euphorie des &eacute;lections, on apprendra au travers des nouvelles que la r&eacute;volte gronde petit &agrave; petit au sein des v&eacute;t&eacute;rans du COPS, comme si quelque chose ne tournait pas rond &agrave; Los Angeles, comme si l'unit&eacute; se sentait manipul&eacute;e. Mais par qui ou par quoi ?<br/><br/>Apr&egrave;s les traditionnels flashs d'informations offrant les derni&egrave;res actualit&eacute;s du monde de COPS, il reste &agrave; en venir au vif du sujet : les horizons lointains dont il est question dans le titre, qui se comptent au nombre de cinq :<br/><br/>L'univers des arcologies, petites villes r&eacute;volutionnaires fonctionnant en circuit ferm&eacute;, associant les derni&egrave;res trouvailles en mati&egrave;re d'architecture et d'&eacute;cologie. L'exemple d&eacute;velopp&eacute; ici se pr&eacute;nomme &quot;Le Biome&quot;, arcologie fond&eacute;e dans la Vall&eacute;e de la Mort, formant une enclave scientifique destin&eacute;e &agrave; &eacute;tudier la cr&eacute;ation d'une biosph&egrave;re en milieu nouveau - comprendre l'espace - et &agrave; assurer la formation des futurs colons de la plan&egrave;te rouge. Tout cops d&eacute;sireux de fouler le sol de la Lune ou de Mars devra n&eacute;cessairement passer par cette &eacute;tape pour se qualifier au cours d'un stage, apr&egrave;s lequel un niveau d'aptitude lui sera remis selon ses r&eacute;sultats. Le Biome est d&eacute;crit secteur par secteur, milieu par milieu pourrait-on dire, avec une insistance sur la psychologie et le quotidien tr&egrave;s particuliers de ses habitants. Vivre en milieu ferm&eacute; 24h/24 n'est pas sans incidences sur le comportement, ce qui aura de quoi d&eacute;stabiliser tout nouveau venu au Biome jusqu'&agrave; son int&eacute;gration dans la communaut&eacute;.<br/><br/>Les stations sous-marines, con&ccedil;ues afin d'explorer, &eacute;tudier, forer sous la surface des oc&eacute;ans. V&eacute;ritable manne pour les corporations, les scientifiques et l'arm&eacute;e, ces stations peuvent se b&acirc;tir de plus en plus profond&eacute;ment &agrave; l'aide de nouveaux mat&eacute;riaux r&eacute;sistants. Les plongeurs et scaphandriers ne sont pas en reste, gr&acirc;ce &agrave; l'utilisation de fluides respiratoires en lieu et place des m&eacute;langes gazeux leur permettant de descendre toujours plus bas, mais la technologie est r&eacute;cente et n'est pas exempte d'effets secondaires. Dans le monde sous-marin, comme dans les colonies spatiales, le mot d'ordre est &quot;optimisation de l'espace&quot; : la surface habitable est limit&eacute;e, tr&egrave;s limit&eacute;e et fait appel aux tr&eacute;sors d'ing&eacute;niosit&eacute; des concepteurs : chaque pouce doit &ecirc;tre exploit&eacute; au mieux pour abriter hommes et machines sans pour autant ressembler &agrave; une prison, la claustrophobie et le sentiment d'enfermement &eacute;tant les pires dangers ici-bas. Dans cette section, c'est l'exemple de la station Poseidon qui est d&eacute;velopp&eacute;, aux mains de la corporation UCAR, bas&eacute;e &agrave; 3000 m&egrave;tres de fond. Seront pass&eacute;s au crible les installations ainsi que le personnel, r&eacute;duit &agrave; passer parfois des mois entiers dans cet univers d&eacute;pourvu de lumi&egrave;re naturelle.<br/><br/>Le territoire de l'Alaska, d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;voqu&eacute; dans Saison 3-2 (Septembre/Octobre/Novembre 2032): California Dreamin', mais qui se r&eacute;duit ici volontairement &agrave; un village. La bourgade de Rampart n'est pas si anodine en d&eacute;pit de sa petite taille : elle se situe sur le chemin d'un important ol&eacute;oduc, elle comporte un bagne en activit&eacute; ainsi que diverses exploitations mini&egrave;res et foresti&egrave;res. Mais c'est oublier la rudesse du climat, autant que des habitants, pour tout cops habitu&eacute; au soleil angelino...<br/><br/>La colonie internationale de LunaCity, qui s'accompagne d'un descriptif de la Lune ainsi que d'un historique de la pr&eacute;sence humaine sur le satellite de la Terre. 2020 : la base lunaire assembl&eacute;e petit &agrave; petit prend le nom de LunaCity, 13 ans plus tard elle compte pr&egrave;s de 20 000 habitants de toutes les nationalit&eacute;s - sauf qu'un sentiment de nationalit&eacute; lunaire commence &agrave; &eacute;merger - vivant dans les profondeurs du sol. Hormis les domes pressuris&eacute;s, les infrastructures sont exactement les m&ecirc;mes qu'une ville terrestre ordinaire. Le suppl&eacute;ment organise une visite des lieux, tout en d&eacute;voilant quelques d&eacute;tails annexes : organisation du syst&egrave;me informatique, pr&eacute;sence des corporations, forces politiques et sociales.<br/><br/>Dernier horizon : Mars, sur laquelle l'homme a mis pied depuis 2016. Plusieurs nations ont d'ores et d&eacute;j&agrave; initi&eacute; la colonisation de la plan&egrave;te rouge, &agrave; commencer par le fr&egrave;re ennemi de la Californie, &agrave; savoir l'Union.

Quelque chose de tellement gros que cela en devient suspect.<br/>&quot;To protect and to serve&quot; &eacute;voque les suites de l'&eacute;lection pr&eacute;sidentielle, &agrave; l'&eacute;chelle de Los Angeles. Le conflit qui couvait jusqu'alors entre la municipalit&eacute; et le LAPD finit par exploser apr&egrave;s un nouvel incident : position difficile pour le COPS, pris entre les deux feux.

The plot of the game is still developing with more presidential elections, marking a shift to the right with the coming to power of the Republican Kevin Sutter. But far from the euphoria of the elections, we learn through the news that the revolt rumbles slowly among veterans of the PSC, as if something was amiss in Los Angeles, as if the unit felt manipulated. But who or what?<br/><br/>After the traditional newsflashes offering the latest news from the world of PSC, it remains to get to the heart of the matter: the distant horizons mentioned in the title, of which there are five in number:<br/><br/>The universe of arcologies, small towns revolutionary operating in closed circuit, combining the latest discoveries in the field of architecture and ecology. The example developed here is named &quot;The Biome&quot; arcology founded in Death Valley, forming an enclave scientific study for the creation of a new environment biosphere - understand space - and the training of future settlers from the Red Planet. All cops eager to set foot on the Moon or Mars will necessarily go through this stage in order to qualify for an internship, after which a level of proficiency will be awarded according to the results. The Biome is described by sector, by mid middle one might say, with an emphasis on psychology and the very special day of its inhabitants. Live in closed 24h/24 is not without impact on behavior, which will be enough to destabilize any newcomer to the Biome integration into the community.<br/><br/>The underwater stations, designed to explore, study, drill beneath the surface of the oceans. Windfall for corporations, scientists and the military, these stations can be built more deeply with new resistant materials. Divers and divers are not left out, thanks to the use of respiratory fluid instead of gas mixtures allowing them to descend still lower, but the technology is new and is not free of side effects. In the underwater world, as in space colonies, the watchword is &quot;space optimization&quot; living space is limited, very limited and uses ingenuity of designers: every inch must be best utilized to house men and machines without looking like a prison, claustrophobia and sense of confinement is the worst dangers down here. In this section, it is the example of Poseidon station which is developed in the hands of the corporation UCAR, based at 3000 meters. Be scrutinized facilities and staff, sometimes reduced to spend whole months in this world devoid of natural light.<br/><br/>The territory of Alaska, already mentioned in California Dreamin ' , but is reduced by a voluntary village. The Rampart town is not so trivial, despite its small size: it lies in the path of a major oil pipeline, it has an active prison and various mining and forestry. But this is to forget the harsh climate, as well as the inhabitants, for all cops used angelino sun ...<br/><br/>International LunaCity colony, which is accompanied by a description of the moon as well as a history of human presence on the Earth's satellite. 2020: the lunar base assembly gradually became known as LunaCity, 13 years later, she has nearly 20,000 inhabitants of all nationalities - but a sense of nationality moon begins to emerge - living deep in the ground. Apart from the domestic pressurized infrastructure are exactly the same as ordinary earthly city. Supplement organizes a site visit, while revealing some details annexes: organization system, presence of corporations, political and social forces.<br/><br/>Last horizon: Mars, on which man has set foot since 2016. Several nations have already begun the colonization of the red planet, starting with the brother of California enemy, namely the Union. The supplement focuses on facilities in California, however. This section takes into account the specific climate and geology of Mars, travel conditions - from the Earth to the Moon, the Moon orbiting space station on Mars, the Martian ground station - before interest the different stations and sub-stations based on the surface of the planet, the life led by settlers and means of travel available.<br/><br/>In addition to these settings, the supplement offers a survival guide in an extreme environment, which includes one explanatory on Space Technology 2030 (spacesuits, rockets and propellants, lunar and Mars vehicles), a second explanation for the subsea technology and finally a series of workshops related to these hostile environments.<br/><br/>Four mini-surveys 10-18 and complete this supplement three scenarios: <br/>&quot;My incredible policeman!&quot;, which takes the cops to 450m below the sea surface, in the bowels of a submarine station for a mission escort. Still getting to know all the crew - civil and military - then something happening. Something so big that it becomes suspect. <br/>&quot;To protect and to serve&quot; evokes the aftermath of the presidential election, across Los Angeles. The simmering conflict between the municipality and until the LAPD will explode after a new incident difficult position for the PSC, caught between two fires. But over the investigation, it is the identity of whoever controls the presidency which will have to be revealed. <br/>&quot;Those Far beyond all remote stars&quot;, which as its name suggests offer a roundtrip space for cops alongside the leader Hiram Chemven realistic. A key, a major event called great lasting impression and solve one of the mysteries of PSC.<br/><br/>To close the supplement, the section reserved for MJ offers a new perspective on each of the &quot;Far Horizons&quot; <br/><br/>     Biome personalities are scrutinized with their real intentions <br/>     the effectiveness of DeepBlue, fluid used by divers to dive depth, is undermined <br/>     the important places and personalities of the city's major Rampart earn detail <br/>     several secrets and shadows of Luna City are revealed <br/>     and the real leaders finally appear in the colony of California in March<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The &quot;survival guide in extreme&quot; is supplemented by different rules to orchestrate the various actions of the characters, incidents and fights under the sea and in space.<br/><br/>But the most important information await the final pages, to find out what is happening behind the actual secession of 2026. The official version of the event is a pale reflection of the truth, and the PSC is a full piece of this puzzle. This disruption occurs in two stages: first a revised version of history, and some tips for leaders to manage these revelations. The last word is reserved for presidential elections, specifically the &quot;power behind the throne&quot;, namely that handles that.<br/><br/>"}, "131077": {"rpgdesigner": ["Beno\u00eet Attinost", "Jeff Beney", "Nicolas Benoist", "Charlotte Bousquet", "Fran\u00e7ois Cedelle", "Thomas Cheilan", "Croc", "Sandy Julien", "Geoffrey Picard", "Marc Sautriot"], "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover version"], "poll": [], "name": "D\u00e9sUnion", "rpgartist": ["Bernard Bittler", "Aleksi Briclot", "Beno\u00eet Girier", "Franck Poterlot", "Christophe Swal"], "rpgproducer": ["Anne-Ga\u00eblle Argy", "Yann Arndt", "Aleksi Briclot", "Greg Cervall", "Thorfin McBoulan", "Geoffrey Picard", "Alicia Simonnet"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1426274.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Crime (Criminal / Law Enforcement)", "Modern (Near Future)", "Science Fiction (Cyberpunk)"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["C.O.P.S."], "rpgpublisher": ["Siroz Productions"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["C.O.P.S.

V&eacute;ritable reflet invers&eacute; de la Californie, l'Union mise publiquement sur le tout s&eacute;curitaire et l'ordre moral. Rien d'&eacute;tonnant que le pouvoir en place c&eacute;l&egrave;bre des ic&ocirc;nes du pass&eacute; telles que J. Edgar Hoover ou Joseph McCarthy - le pays lorgne sans rougir sur le &quot;pass&eacute; glorieux&quot; des ann&eacute;es 1950, au point que l'on ne cesse de puiser dans celles-ci, en politique comme en architecture. L'Union ? Le pays o&ugrave; le bonheur est n&eacute;, et nul n'a le droit de contester cette devise.<br/><br/>Avant de poursuivre la description de ce suppl&eacute;ment, il reste &agrave; noter une chose : D&eacute;sUnion ne s'adresse qu'aux meneurs de jeu ou peu s'en faut. S'il existe, comme dans toute la gamme, une partie accessible aux joueurs, celle-ci est minimale. D&eacute;sUnion &eacute;voque avant tout les coulisses de la politique entre Californie et Union, avant et apr&egrave;s la s&eacute;cession, coulisses qui n'ont que fort peu de choses &agrave; voir avec ce que les livres d'histoire ont pu retenir de l'ind&eacute;pendance.<br/><br/>Les nouvelles d'ambiance alimentent le chaos qui alimente le COPS et la mairie de Los Angeles : amis et ennemis d'hier sont appel&eacute;s &agrave; changer de camp tandis que la ville assiste &agrave; la lente agonie politique de son &eacute;quipe municipale - et du mouvement des Compagnons dans sa globalit&eacute;.<br/><br/>Retour au vif du sujet : les dix pages fournies aux joueurs offrent un portrait divis&eacute; de l'Union. Une pr&eacute;sentation tir&eacute;e des d&eacute;pliants officiels offre une vision idyllique du pays : l'Union se veut l'&eacute;tat le plus s&ucirc;r au monde, s'appuyant sur une population civique, pieuse et d&eacute;vou&eacute;e - respecter la loi n'est pas assez, collaborer est la r&egrave;gle. Cette section procure &eacute;galement divers d&eacute;tails sur le quotidien du citoyen lambda : s&eacute;curit&eacute;, mode de vie, loisirs et traditions. Cependant, une deuxi&egrave;me pr&eacute;sentation, l'Union vue du c&ocirc;t&eacute; californien, vient mettre &agrave; mal cet &eacute;quilibre : sont d&eacute;nonc&eacute;s les pratiques polici&egrave;res outranci&egrave;res, les milices, la chasse aux &eacute;l&eacute;ments subversifs, le contr&ocirc;le des informations, le syst&egrave;me carc&eacute;ral. Sans oublier une question : qu'est devenue la p&egrave;gre au sein de l'Union ? D&eacute;sormais cantonn&eacute;e dans des quartiers soigneusement d&eacute;limit&eacute;s, celle-ci est autoris&eacute;e par la police... en &eacute;change de sa collaboration active. Quelques rumeurs filtrent cependant, sur une nouvelle p&egrave;gre (non contr&ocirc;l&eacute;e, celle-ci), mais surtout sur les &eacute;cueils du syst&egrave;me de s&eacute;curit&eacute; am&eacute;ricain : et si les puces implant&eacute;es dans chaque habitant du pays n'&eacute;tait pas si fiables ? Le vaste r&eacute;seau de l'Union, fiert&eacute; nationale, pr&eacute;senterait-il des failles ?<br/><br/>Le suppl&eacute;ment se poursuit avec sa plus vaste section : 80 pages d&eacute;volues aux sc&eacute;narios avec trois enqu&ecirc;tes compl&egrave;tes et un 10-18.<br/>&quot;Groupement d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t&quot; d&eacute;bute avec le meurtre de l'un des PNJ normalement familier aux joueurs : l'agent Benets, de la police scientifique. Membre actif d'un groupuscule d&eacute;di&eacute; aux conspirations, Benets menait une &eacute;trange double vie, dans laquelle les cops devront se plonger pour d&eacute;nouer l'intrigue. Si le laborantin avait mis la main sur un trop gros dossier, les cops sauront-ils faire mieux ?<br/>&quot;Oeil pour oeil&quot; int&eacute;grera les cops au sein du NABI, North American Bureau of Investigation, une unit&eacute; nouvellement cr&eacute;&eacute;e int&eacute;grant des policiers de l'Union comme de la Californie, capable d'op&eacute;rer sur les deux territoires. La traque d'un dangereux pr&eacute;dateur sexuel venant de traverser la fronti&egrave;re m&egrave;nera les personnages jusqu'&agrave; New York. Reste &agrave; savoir si la collaboration entre policiers des deux pays surmontera les pr&eacute;jug&eacute;s entre Californie et Union.<br/>&quot;Que sera sera&quot; : la traque d'un tueur en s&eacute;rie dont les agissements d&eacute;passent toute logique va mener les cops &agrave; r&eacute;v&eacute;ler l'un des secrets les mieux gard&eacute;s de Californie - ce qui ne sera pas sans cons&eacute;quences pour la ville comme pour la division COPS tout enti&egrave;re.<br/><br/>Si le 10-18 qui accompagne ces trois enqu&ecirc;tes semble isol&eacute;, son impact sur l'univers du jeu ne doit en aucun cas &ecirc;tre n&eacute;glig&eacute;. Son titre est on ne peut plus significatif : &quot;Moi, Kristin L., 36 ans, viol&eacute;e, bris&eacute;e&quot;.<br/><br/>Le chapitre final, r&eacute;serv&eacute; au meneur, reprend l&agrave; o&ugrave; Saison 3-3 (D\u00e9cembre 2032/Ao\u00fbt 2033): Horizons Lointains s'&eacute;tait achev&eacute;. Si le suppl&eacute;ment pr&eacute;c&eacute;dent s'attachait &agrave; d&eacute;crire la v&eacute;rit&eacute; sur les &eacute;v&egrave;nements du pass&eacute;, avant et pendant la s&eacute;cession, et sur deux des acteurs principaux de l'univers, les Compagnons et les R&eacute;alistes, D&eacute;sUnion poursuit ce travail en d&eacute;crivant la technologie li&eacute;e &agrave; la m&eacute;m&eacute;tique, les origines du Core et ses relations, ce que cache le Trinitron, ainsi qu'un personnage destin&eacute; &agrave; jouer les &eacute;lectrons libres. La politique officieuse entre Californie et Union est elle aussi pass&eacute;e au crible, tout en sachant que les deux &eacute;tats ont affaire &agrave; une crise majeure : la Californie assiste &agrave; la programm&eacute;e chute des Compagnons, assaillis de tous bords, tandis qu'un scandale international isole un peu plus l'Union - si ce n'est que tout cela ob&eacute;it &agrave; un plan expliqu&eacute; dans ces pages. Retour, par la suite, en Californie avec de plus petits scandales et manipulations.<br/><br/>Le suppl&eacute;ment s'ach&egrave;ve avec trois pages consacr&eacute;es au NABI, de fa&ccedil;on &agrave; permettre une campagne &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur de l'Union. Sont pass&eacute;s en revue le statut du NABI, son fonctionnement, ses pr&eacute;rogatives et les moyens qui lui sont allou&eacute;s. La principale &eacute;pine dans le pied des cops int&eacute;gr&eacute;s &agrave; cette unit&eacute; demeurant la collaboration de leurs confr&egrave;res de l'Union : un badge du NABI est loin de suffire...<br/><br/><br/>Translation courtesy of Google:<br/><br/>If, through various supplements range PSC neighbors California (Mexico, Canada, Nevada) have been described, a gap remained, namely the enemy brother of Golden State: the Union. True mirror image of California, Union publicly put on all safe and moral. Surprising that the powers that be famous icons of the past such as J. Edgar Hoover and Joseph McCarthy - eyeing the country without a blush on the &quot;glorious past&quot; of the 1950s, to the point that we constantly draw them, in politics as in architecture. The Union? The country where happiness is born, and no one has the right to challenge this currency.<br/><br/>Before continuing with the description of this supplement, it remains to note one thing: disunity is only for playmakers or nearly so. If there is, as in the range, some accessible to players, it is minimal. Disunity evokes all the backstage politics between California and Union before and after secession, scenes that have only very little to do with what the history books have been able to retain independence.<br/><br/>The new room feeding the chaos that feeds the PSC and the city of Los Angeles friends and former enemies are known to change sides while the city witnessing the slow death policy of his municipal team - and the movement of Companions in its entirety.<br/><br/>Back to the point: ten pages provided players offer a portrait of the divided Union. Presentation drawn from official pamphlets offers an idyllic vision of the country: Union wants state the safest in the world, based on a population civic pious and devoted - law enforcement is not enough work is the rule. This section also provides various details about the daily life of the average citizen security, lifestyle, leisure and traditions. However, a second presentation, the Union side view California, comes to undermine this equilibrium are reported police practice outrageous, militias, the hunt for subversives, control information, the prison system. Not to mention a question: what happened to the underworld in the Union? Now confined areas carefully delineated, it is authorized by the police ... in exchange for his active collaboration. Some rumors filter however, a new mob (uncontrolled thereof), but also the pitfalls of American security system: and if the chips implanted in every person in the country was not so reliable? The extensive network of the European Union, national pride, would have there flaws?<br/><br/>The supplement continues with its largest section: 80 pages assigned to scenarios with three comprehensive surveys and 10-18.<br/>&quot;Interest Group&quot; begins with the murder of one of the NPCs normally familiar to players: Benet agent, police science. Active member of a small group dedicated to conspiracies, Benet led a strange double life, in which the cops will plunge to unravel the plot. If the lab had laid hands on a too big file, the cops will they do better?<br/>&quot;An eye for an eye&quot; integrate cops in the NABI, North American Bureau of Investigation, a newly created unit incorporating EU police as California, capable of operating in both territories. The hunt for a dangerous sexual predator from across the border will lead the characters to New York. Remains whether the collaboration between police of the two countries overcome prejudices between California and Union.<br/>&quot;Que sera sera&quot;: the hunt for a serial killer whose actions beyond any sense will lead the cops to be one of the best kept secrets of California - which will not be without consequences for the city and for the PSC entire division.<br/><br/>10-18 If that accompanies these three surveys seems isolated, its impact on the game world should never be neglected. The title could not be more significant, &quot;Me, Kristin L., 36, raped, broken.&quot;<br/><br/>The final chapter, reserved leader, picks up where Distant Horizons was completed. If the supplement previous clung to describe the truth about past events before and during the secession, and two of the major players in the world, the Companions and the Realists, disunity continues this work by describing the related technology memetics, the origins of the Core and its relations, which hides the Trinitron and a character destined to play free electrons. The unofficial policy between California and Union is also under scrutiny, knowing that the two states are dealing with a major crisis in California attending the scheduled drop Companions attacked from all sides, while international scandal isolates Union a little more - if it is that this follows a plan described in these pages. Return later in California with smaller scandals and manipulations.<br/><br/>The supplement ends with three pages devoted to NABI, to allow a campaign within the Union. Are reviewed the status of NABI, its operation, authority and resources allocated to it. The main thorn in the side of the cops integrated into this unit remains the collaboration of their colleagues in the Union: NABI's badge is not nearly enough ...<br/><br/>"}, "131078": {"rpgdesigner": ["Beno\u00eet Attinost", "Jeff Beney", "Nicolas Benoist", "Charlotte Bousquet", "Fran\u00e7ois Cedelle", "Thomas Cheilan", "Croc", "Sandy Julien", "Geoffrey Picard", "Olivier Roullier", "Marc Sautriot"], "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover version"], "poll": [], "name": "Little One", "rpgartist": ["Bernard Bittler", "Aleksi Briclot", "J\u00e9r\u00e9my Masson", "Franck Poterlot", "Pascal Quidault", "Christophe Swal", "Yann Val\u00e9ani"], "rpgproducer": ["Anne-Ga\u00eblle Argy", "Yann Arndt", "Aleksi Briclot", "Greg Cervall", "Thorfin McBoulan", "Geoffrey Picard", "Alicia Simonnet"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1426421.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Crime (Criminal / Law Enforcement)", "Modern (Near Future)", "Science Fiction (Cyberpunk)"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["C.O.P.S."], "rpgpublisher": ["Siroz Productions"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["C.O.P.S.

It is then that the supplement will seek to show the extent of damage in three main parts which are usually composed supplements range.<br/><br/>LAPD records, 53 pages, covers the public part of the Little One, giving clues and some info on what happened behind the scenes. This chapter therefore opens after a short novel, the description of the Little One of the first quake to the last line, describing the devastation in California and especially Los Angles, whose buildings devoured by the Grey Plague, or constructed bribes but unprotected seismic collapse one after the other. What is not destroyed is flooded, and the corpses piling up in the streets become canals, they are not trapped under the rubble. But what will be the biggest kick in the anthill policy of the young republic is that Little One is not a natural earthquake. He was provoked.<br/><br/>The rest of the chapter is devoted to the &quot;after&quot;. Life was gradually rebuilt around relief overwhelmed, and a large part of the population is trying to find ways to continue to survive, some by the looting and violence, others by helping others.

Finally, &quot;Xochimalcas&quot; takes place several months after Little One and sends the characters search the secrets of the Aztec Nation.<br/><br/>The third and final chapter, &quot;The SAD Records&quot;, 43 pages, covers the storyline of the game Little One at the end of 2034, with some information on the early 2035. After a brief new chapter begins with a focus on the mechanical ignoble policy Little One and its direct consequences. The result is a state of California: LA district by district, and county by county the rest. The collapse of the entire infrastructure of California allows free rein to criminals who are not going to bother for a benefit, especially with the absence of PSC in the frame.<br/><br/>The last three sections cover political developments in the post Little One, a society and special protection and give finally tracks on the future of California after Christmas 2034.<br/><br/>"}, "131079": {"rpgdesigner": ["Beno\u00eet Attinost", "Jeff Beney", "Nicolas Benoist", "Charlotte Bousquet", "Fran\u00e7ois Cedelle", "Thomas Cheilan", "Croc", "Jean-Marc Dumartin", "Sandy Julien", "Pierre Nuss", "Geoffrey Picard", "Olivier Roullier", "Marc Sautriot"], "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover version"], "poll": [], "name": "Endgame", "rpgartist": ["Bernard Bittler", "Aleksi Briclot", "J\u00e9r\u00e9my Masson", "Franck Poterlot", "Pascal Quidault", "Christophe Swal", "Yann Val\u00e9ani"], "rpgproducer": ["Aleksi Briclot", "Greg Cervall", "Thorfin McBoulan", "Geoffrey Picard", "Alicia Simonnet"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1426423.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Crime (Criminal / Law Enforcement)", "Modern (Near Future)", "Science Fiction (Cyberpunk)"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["C.O.P.S."], "rpgpublisher": ["Siroz Productions"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["C.O.P.S.

Then, the job of an undercover agent (&quot;Agent Undercover Mission&quot;) is discussed in detail, both from a functional point of view and legal, but also morally and extremely risky double life of the agent.

The &quot;Case Clemente / Venario&quot; puts an end to this story that ran on several supplements the game, as the characters are investigating a third murder similar to Naomi Clemente in 2030, which will allow them to discover a criminal monstrous in their circle of colleagues. &quot;Guantanamo Social Club&quot; will bring the characters to investigate a war zone before ending up in a prison for terrorists, while &quot;Public Enemies&quot; will involve the PCs a TV reality show to stop live criminals, even if they do not participate in as a game. Finally, &quot;The Last Session&quot; is a scenario designed to provide a true end to a long campaign of PSC, since the characters after a lengthy investigation, will eventually be sacrificed on the altar of the common good and disappear as a hero, if all goes well.<br/><br/>&quot;The SAD Files&quot; (66 pages) contains all the tracks and stories unfinished in the range, to allow leaders who wish to continue to play in this universe with all the elements to do so.

Then, two sections are devoted to the American prison system, administration which the characters have told many people during their careers.

This force is greatly outnumbered by the &Eacute;migr&eacute; French General Langeron&rsquo;s wing of the Army of Silesia, consisting of the IX and X Corps of Russian and Prussian forces.  These two corps, with tremendous artillery support, have an overwhelming superiority in numbers over the French Imperial forces.<br/><br/>The battle, which saw the Coalition forces push the Poles and French out of the Wiederitzsch after three brutal hours of combat, was among the most intensive of any of the battles in the Leipzig cycle.  Historically, the twin villages change hands several times.  Marshal Enterprises has developed special rules to reflect the gruesome nature of the conflict, and the almost mystical determination of the Poles to prevail over their hated Russian neighbors.<br/><br/>Each 20 minute turn starts with a Command Phase for both sides followed by the French Player sequence and then by the Prussian Player sequence. The sequence includes movement, cavalry charges, fire and melee. During each, morale plays a decisive role.

Liberal historians tend to focus on the political and ideological background of the revolution and ignore the social and economic issues. Left wing historians, particularly Anarchist writers, tend to view the revolution as the expression of the mass will to reject authoritarian intervention in their liberty and freedom. Revisionist historians consider the revolution as arising primarily from below, that is, from the peasants and the workers. And most historians tend to take an obligatory swipe at the Tsar, Tsarina and Rasputin, and then ignore the bureaucracy, the armed forces high command (Stavka) and the bourgeois reactionaries forever after.<br/><br/>Rather than attempt to justify one or the other of these dogmas, perhaps it would be easier to realize that Russia in 1917 was an enormous paradox. She was one of the largest countries in the world in terms of both area and population, yet her economy was primitive and underdeveloped, and 85% of her population consisted of illiterate and superstitious peasants with no interests in anything much beyond the limits of their own villages, least of all politics. Russia was about a century behind the development of the other Great Powers, and although she was finally trying to catch up, she was handicapped by a political system and an absolute monarch that were simply unequal to the 20th Century. When the revolution finally came, it was solely Russian, which is to say, a national phenomenon with a traditional outlook; and it adhered to the Standard Operating Procedures for revolutions, which is to say, that it was initiated by the moderates and then ultimately taken over by the extremists. But to Lenin and his Bolshevik organization, the revolution was going to have a global outlook with the intent of imposing Lenin&rsquo;s vision of socialism on the entire world.<br/><br/>Regardless of the name given to the events in Petrograd in 1917, the facts are that there was a popular revolution followed by a Bolshevik coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat. Petrograd 1917 starts with the popular revolution that had been initiated by the moderates, was taken over by the extremists, and then succumbed to the inevitable coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat. Players will find that staging a successful coup will not be as easy as it was for Lenin, who was blessed with the unwitting but invaluable assistance of Kerensky.<br/><br/>This is a card-based simulation for 2 to 6 players, each of whom will try to create a political organization and help it to gain influence, so that it becomes the predominant political party in Russia, either by votes or by force. The game board represents Petrograd, the capital of Russia, which was the site of most of what happened at the time.

The Trumptus is their only hope of chasing away evil Panthea and her Munculus warriors. But where to look for the pieces? They are all over Centopia, and behind every corner there might be an evil Munculus warrior. Cautiously, the players search for the pieces. Will they be able to find all the pieces before Panthea manages to mobilise her troops?<br/><br/>Gameplay: The Trumptus and Munculus chits are randomised and placed into the slits in the game board. Each player gets an elf board. The Panthea board is placed in the middle of the table, next to the game board. Players take turns rolling the die. If a number from 1-3 is rolled, the corresponding number of chits is taken from the game board and placed in front of the active player's elf board. Then he/she can decide if they want to roll again or end their turn. They may repeat this step as often as they want, as long as they don't draw a Munculus chit from the board or roll the Munculus symbol.<br/>If a player decides to end their turn, they place all the Trumptus chits of their own colour on their elf board. They return the Trumptus chits of other players' colours to the game board (putting them into slits of their choice). Then it's the next player's turn.<br/>If a Munculus chit is drawn, the player's turn is over immediately. The Munculus chit is placed on the Panthea board. Previously drawn Trumptus chits are returned to the board and the die is handed over to the next player. If the Munculus symbol is rolled, the player's turn is over too. All previously drawn Trumptus chits are given to the players they belong to, and they place them on their elf boards.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player has placed all 8 Trumptus chits of their colour on their elf board. That player wins the game. The game also ends when the Panthea board has been completely filled with Munculus chits. In this case, Panthea wins.

This is the evil snake's fault, because she has coaxed the time watchman into turning back the time. Who is going to help the Little Prince and his friends to scare away the snake and bring the hours of the day and night into the correct sequence?<br/><br/>Setup: The starting tile is placed in the middle of the table. The time rays are placed to its sides so that a long time ray from 0 to 24 hours is created (the time rays have numbers from 0-24 printed on them). The hour tiles (showing clocks) are shuffled together with the snake tiles and put face down on the table. Each player gets a character tile and places it in front of him/herself on the table.<br/><br/>Aim of the game: To put as many hour tiles as possible in the correct position on the time ray and by doing so collect as many cogwheel chits as possible. Remembering where the evil snakes are hidden will help you to defeat them and win the game!<br/><br/>Gameplay: The start player puts his/her character tile in a position of the time ray that isn't yet taken up by an hour tile. Then he/she turns over one of the face-down tiles from the middle of the table. If it shows the same time as the position the player has put his/her character tile in (e.g. the character tile is on the &quot;11&quot; position of the time ray and the tile depicts a clock showing 11 o'clock), the hour tile is put in that position, the character tile is returned to the player, and he/she earns a cogwheel chit. If the hour tile doesn't match, the hour tile is returned to its old place in the middle of the table.<br/><br/>If a snake tile is turned over, the player has two options: First, he/she can simply return the snake tile face down to its old place. Second, he/she can return it face up and try to turn over the other two snake tiles. If he/she is successful, he/she immediately wins the game. If he/she isn't, he/she loses a cogwheel chit and then it's the next player's turn.<br/><br/>There are two ways the game can end:<br/>a) The evil snake has been defeated (i.e. a player has turned over all three snake tiles). In this case there are two winners: The player who has turned over the snake tiles and the player who at this moment owns the most cogwheel chits.<br/>b) All the hour tiles have been correctly placed on the time ray.

Players also have 3 types of fairy pieces: 2 unicorns (moving like a knight with an additional single cell right angle move), 2 wizards (moving like a bishop, but only to other levels in the 3rd &amp; 4th dimensions) and 1 minstrel (a non-capturing piece, that moves like a rook and prevents orthogonally adjacent pieces from making a capturing move). Players take turns moving pieces one at a time, but a variant allows players 2 moves a turn to speed up the game. The goal is to checkmate the king.<br/><br/>Some of the traditional pieces have altered moves, beyond the 4 dimensional aspect. The king only moves and captures orthogonally one space. Pawns move orthogonally one space and captures diagonally one space. Rooks move and capture orthogonally, but also changes direction at a right angle once it meets a wall. Bishops move on 2D diagonals and on 3D or 4D diagonals (but not on the 2D diagonals of other levels). Knights move as chess knights. The Queen moves as a Chesseract rook or bishop.<br/><br/>One huge challenge in Chesseract is to try and envision moves in 4 dimensions.

The game features Invasion and Colonization of Planets, Technology Research, Tactical Space-combat, Ship Construction and Customization, Anomalies and Resource Management.<br/><br/>Gameplay consists of building structures (ex. energy collectors) to gather resources, colonize planets to man your spaceships and research technology to equip your fleet, planets and shipyard.<br/><br/>This is accomplished by drawing cards from your deck and playing them according to various rules and time-based mechanics (building ships takes time for example).<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to defeat the opposing player according to three different victory-conditions:<br/><br/>Extinction - The opposing player loses all Population (by invasion or destruction of planets or structures)<br/><br/>Starvation - The opposing player loses all Energy (by stealing energy or destroying collectors)<br/><br/>Burnout - The opposing player loses the ability to play Units (by losing all cards in his main deck and hand)<br/><br/>Millennium Gravitas relies less on luck-of-the-draw than other comparable games and gives the player more control over their strategy. The core mechanics are focused on flexibility and tactics rather than deck-building or owning the most powerful cards to overpower your opponent.<br/><br/>The game supports different game-modes, like 1vs1, 2vs2 or +4vs (the mechanics theoretically do not limit the amount of players that are able to play together or against each other). All complex play styles are supported, from team-matches to last-man-standing. This creates many interesting games with temporary alliances and even politics as emergent game-play. Additionally Millennium does not require a game-board or sophisticated game-pieces and miniatures, all you need to play is knowledge of the rules, your own deck, and something to be used as tokens.<br/><br/>"}, "131224": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1436276.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Carl Chudyk"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Marcin Jakubowski", "Benjamin Raynal"], "boardgamepublisher": ["IELLO"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1436276_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game"], "description": "At the 2012 Essen Spiel, the following 5 promo cards will be given to customers that pre-order Uchronia:<br/><br/><br/>     Nursery<br/>     Ranch<br/>     Canal<br/>     Pterodrome<br/>     Embassy<br/><br/><br/>The Uchronia Promo Cards are a set of 5 cards to be added to those in the Uchronia base game.

Each player has a scoresheet with the numbers 2-12 in rows of red and yellow and the numbers 12-2 in rows of green and blue. To score points you want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it's to the right of all marked-off numbers in the same row.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player rolls six dice: two white and one of each of the four colors listed above. Each player can choose to mark off the sum of the two white dice on one of their four rows, then the active player can choose to mark off the sum of one colored die and one white die in the row that's the same color as the die. The more marks you can make in a row, the higher your score for that row. Fail to cross off a number when you're the active player, however, and you must mark one of four penalty boxes on your scoresheet. If you mark off the 2 or 12 in a row and have at least five numbers marked in that row, you get to also mark off the padlock symbol in that row, locking everyone else out of this color.<br/><br/>When either a player has four penalty boxes marked or a second color is locked, the game ends immediately. Players then tally their points for each color, sum these values, then subtract five points for each marked penalty box.

Relive this comedy about the Middle Ages and have fun with Aristoocrazy!<br/><br/>Each player has ten unique characters from his family at his disposal &ndash; five noblemen and five noblewomen &ndash; but he starts with only one pair of aristrocrats. Throughout the game, characters will struggle to conquer neutral regions or those controlled by an opponent, in addition to using the benefits of their abilities. Each character has three abilities, which are helpful for gaining victory points (VPs) or attacking other characters. The game has nine different abilities, which are represented by cardboard tokens. When a male and female character marry, new characters are born into play, with the newborn children inheriting its parents' abilities.<br/><br/>If two characters with a close family relationship meet, however, there is a risk that their child will be &quot;different&quot;. When such a child grows up, naturally you'll need him to take care of your domain or a military campaign that you're running &ndash; but if his wits aren't in the right place, he won't be of much help. (And who would want to marry such a dud in the first place?)<br/><br/>Aristoocrazy lasts twelve rounds, and at the end of each round the victory conditions for the current round are evaluated. The players try to optimize their actions &ndash; moves on the board, attacks, the use of abilities &ndash; in order to fulfill the victory conditions defined on the event card in place for that round.

Nowadays commercial usage is the core business of the Canal; its economic impact is profound and has not only developed the region, but in fact helped define shipping throughout the world.<br/><br/>In the wake of the Canal&rsquo;s opening hull designs were influenced accordingly; ships fell into three categories, those that could travel through easily and in groups (Feeder class), massive ocean-going ships too big to enter the Canal (ULCV or Ultra Large Container Vessels), and the new standard&mdash;designed to the maximum limits of the Panama Canal. These ships are called PANAMAX.<br/><br/>In Panamax each player manages a shipping company established in the Col&oacute;n Free Trade Zone. Companies accept contracts from both US coasts, China and Europe and deliver cargo in order to make money, attract investment and pay dividends. At the same time the players accumulate their own stock investments and try to make as much money as possible in an effort to have the largest personal fortune and win the game.<br/><br/>Panamax features several original mechanisms that blend together; an original dice (action) selection table, pickup-and-deliver along a single bi-directional route, a chain reaction movement system&mdash;&ldquo;pushing&rdquo;  ships to make room throughout the Canal and a level of player interaction that is part self-interest, part mutual advantage and the freedom to choose how you play.<br/><br/>On their turn, players remove a die from the Action table to select Contracts and Load Cargo or Move ships until the pool of dice is emptied ending the Round. Over the course of three rounds these actions are blended during the turn to create a logistics network which the players use to ship their cargo, minimize transportation fees and increase the net worth of their Companies. Each Company has a limited amount of Stock that the players can purchase in exchange for investing&mdash;receiving a dividend each round. The questions for the players will be which companies are likely to yield higher dividends?<br/><br/>There&rsquo;s more to explore and several ways to win, but we ask that you join us at the table and celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the Panama Canal with a session of Panamax!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "Italian first edition", "Japanese first edition", "Multilingual first edition", "Spanish/Portuguese first edition"], "average": "7.42236", "name": "Panamax", "playingtime": "100", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Dice Rolling", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Point to Point Movement", "Stock Holding", "Worker Placement"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "2474", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Cities: Panama City", "Country: Panama"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Dice Tower News 230 - March 12, 2014", "Episode 1: Troyes, Willow, and Warhammer Quest", "Episode 27: Splendor, Blueprints, Gen Con Preview and Travel Gaming", "Episode 30: Gen Con 2014, Machi Koro and Pandemic: Contagion", "Episode 47 -- Four Coins in a Fountain", "Episode 48 -- De-icing and the Redemption of Humanity", "Episode 49- Panamax and Board Game Confessions", "Episode 5 - The Gateway to Gaming", "Episode 53 -- The First Time Ever I Saw Your Meeple", "Episode 64 - Siege The Canal", "Episode 72 March Craziness Dice Game Style Part 1", "Episode 77 Origins preview, Buonocore drops by, and Xmen chat (spoilers)", "Episode 7: Terra Mystica, Rambo: First Blood, and a Digital App Medley", "Episode 80-- Gen Con Previews of Greater Than Games and Stronghold Games", "Episode 81-- Gen Con 2014 Top 11 to Try and Top 11 to Buy with special gues W.

Prepare twelve playing fields that correspond to individual rooms. Then shuffle the word cards and give them out among the players. Everyone holds their cards hidden. When you insert a CD into the player and turn on the shuffle mode. The game begins. Youngest player chooses a card and pantomime the word shown. Other players have one attempt to guess words, anyone can guess. Correct guess is the first successful step to avert danger in the room (you put the card in the appropriate room). If guessing is not successful, then take a card in your hand and performs a new word. Words are selected from the songs, so playing song can serve as a hint. You have to guess 5 words for each room.

Together you will become a band of narrators collaborating on telling new stories. You will each need a pencil, some writing paper, a small opaque bag, ten read beads and ten white beads. You will also need five candles (place one in front of each narrator and one in the centre between the narrators). These candles symbolize the radiance of the narrators and the world which they will create. (As with any naked flame, please be careful when using these candles).<br/><br/>You will also need a place where all of you feel comfortable. Some people enjoy an audience listening to the stories they are creating, whilst other prefer to just have the other narrators present. It all comes down to personal preference. As for time, you'll probably need to create your stories over the course of a few sessions, and the length of each session will vary depending on how much time you have and what you feel is right for you. An easy way to decide how long your sessions should be is for each narrator to say how long they want most movies to be. Much longer than the usual time you and the other narrators like movies to last and you may find yourselves becoming distracted or tired, while much shorter sessions may not provide you with the time needed to give the story sufficient momentum. As for how many sessions there should be, I recommend three to five, but you may find that another amount works better for you.<br/><br/>"}, "131310": {"poll": [], "name": "So-Soo-Yoo \u7d20\u6570\u904a", "playingtime": "5", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Point to Point Movement", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "2005", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Teruen Games"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "5", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Dice", "Math"], "age": "4", "minplaytime": "5", "description": "Board game.

The goal is the destruction of the evil stronghold, which spews undead enemies to oppose you.  Defeating enemies gives experience, money, and random gear. Gaining enough experience to level allows the player to upgrade one of Paladog's abilities.  Money can be used to purchase upgrades for allies or to buy gear.  There are two kinds of gear: maces and rings.  Maces are used to cast spells, and rings augment various things, such as experience gain or mana regeneration.<br/><br/>"}, "131335": {"rpgdesigner": ["T.

The New York King's throne is vacant. Rather than collapsing into fights between families, each family will send his or her best wiseguy into the city and its suburbs to find out who has more moxie, and in turn which family will rise. Money talks in this world, so the only goal in this game is to prove your wiseguy's worth by making the most money you can in one night. In simpler game terms, the player with the most money at the end of the game will be the new King of New York.<br/><br/>The game board represents the connected districts of the city of Manhattan. During the game, missions will be available to different players. These mission smartphone cards show how many characters are necessary for its implementation, the location where the mission may be accepted and where it must be completed, whether or not it is a dangerous mission (NYPD watch!), and of course the amount of money you can make.<br/><br/>During your turn you will begin a phase of corruption. Each player secretly tries to buy the first position player AND the right to control the police. Then players pick &quot;resources&quot; cards, which will be used to generate events or increase movements. Next, each player moves his characters &mdash; his wiseguy and his henchmen &mdash; then plays the actions he choose. Players can accept a mission, complete a mission, provoke opposing characters, or try to recruit new henchmen.<br/><br/>Provocation is a kind of &quot;Texas Hold'em&quot; poker duel with die. You first bet, then throw three dice (the &quot;flop&quot;). Either one folds and loses his bet down or the provocation goes on until the shootout (fifth dice). Just like in poker, the weaker hand loses the pot and one of his characters.<br/><br/>When a character or characters are stopped by the police during a dangerous mission, these situations are also managed through die rolls.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["French first edition"], "age": "13", "name": "New York Kings", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Dice Rolling", "Pick-up and Deliver"], "average": "6.33333", "usersrated": "33", "boardgamefamily": ["Cities: New York (New York, USA)", "Country: USA"]}, "131347": {"rpgartist": ["Matt Beauchamp", "Doug Blanchard", "Gideon", "Paul D.

Each nation subtracts a different amount from their final score to reflect imbalance in the positions; each nation starts with different amounts of money and units, and also collects a different amount of taxes each year.<br/><br/>"}, "131352": {"rpgdesigner": ["Darrin Drader"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "New Heroic Aliens", "rpgartist": ["Cynthia Fliege", "Sean Glenn"], "rpgproducer": ["Eric W.

You need to manipulate, bluff and bribe your way to power. Your object is to destroy the influence of all the other families, forcing them into exile. Only one family will survive...<br/><br/>In Coup, you want to be the last player with influence in the game, with influence being represented by face-down character cards in your playing area.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with two coins and two influence &ndash; i.e., two face-down character cards; the fifteen card deck consists of three copies of five different characters, each with a unique set of powers:<br/><br/><br/>     Duke: Take three coins from the treasury. Block someone from taking foreign aid.<br/>     Assassin: Pay three coins and try to assassinate another player's character.<br/>     Contessa: Block an assassination attempt against yourself.<br/>     Captain: Take two coins from another player, or block someone from stealing coins from you.<br/>     Ambassador: Draw two character cards from the Court (the deck), choose which (if any) to exchange with your face-down characters, then return two. Block someone from stealing coins from you.<br/><br/><br/>On your turn, you can take any of the actions listed above, regardless of which characters you actually have in front of you, or you can take one of three other actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Income: Take one coin from the treasury.<br/>     Foreign aid: Take two coins from the treasury.<br/>     Coup: Pay seven coins and launch a coup against an opponent, forcing that player to lose an influence. (If you have ten coins or more, you must take this action.)<br/><br/><br/>When you take one of the character actions &ndash; whether actively on your turn, or defensively in response to someone else's action &ndash; that character's action automatically succeeds unless an opponent challenges you. In this case, if you can't (or don't) reveal the appropriate character, you lose an influence, turning one of your characters face-up. Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you're out of the game.<br/><br/>If you do have the character in question and choose to reveal it, the opponent loses an influence, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not.<br/><br/>The last player to still have influence &ndash; that is, a face-down character &ndash; wins the game!<br/><br/>A new &amp; optional character called the Inquisitor has been added (currently, the only English edition with the Inquisitor included is the Kickstarter Version from Indie Boards &amp; Cards. Copies in stores may not be the Kickstarter versions and may only be the base game). The Inquisitor character cards may be used to replace the Ambassador cards.<br/><br/><br/>     Inquisitor: Draw one character card from the Court deck and choose whether or not to exchange it with one of your face-down characters. OR Force an opponent to show you one of their character cards (their choice which). If you wish it, you may then force them to draw a new card from the Court deck.

The cards can also be used as a starting point for discussion.<br/><br/>The game centers around questions like &quot;What would you do if you wanted to get home from a party at night and the driver is drunk?&quot; or &quot;What would you do if a friend tells you he is homosexual?&quot;<br/><br/>The game confronts you with 60 tricky situations from the area of politics, ethics and society. There is one card for each situation. The front side introduces the situation and the back describes three possible reactions to the situation. Players decide how they would react and try to guess what others would do. If you know the other players well, you earn points.<br/><br/>There are three variants for playing the game:<br/><br/>1) In the most basic variant, one player reads one of the reactions from the back of a card. The other players try to guess what the situation is by asking yes/no questions. The player who first guesses the situation wins the card. The game ends when each player has been the &quot;reader&quot; once or twice. The player with the most cards wins the game.<br/>Suggested minimum number of players: 3<br/><br/>2) One player reads a situation and the three reactions from the back of the card. All players (including the reader, R) guess how R would most likely react. They write down the letter assigned to this reaction on a slip of paper. Before the players hand in their guesses, R chooses three players of which he/she thinks that they've guessed correctly. The chosen players show their guesses and R shows his/her answer. For each matching answer R gets one point, the chosen players get 2 points if they've guessed correctly. Now all the other guesses are collected and counted. All other players (i.e. everyone except R and the 3 chosen players) get one point if the majority has guessed correctly. Then the next player becomes R. The game ends when each player has been R once. The player with the most points wins the game.<br/>Suggested minimum number of players: 8<br/><br/>3) A situation and the three reactions are read. Each player decides how he/she would react and writes down the corresponding letter on a slip of paper. The answers are handed in. Now each player guesses how many people have chosen answers A, B and C. They right the numbers down in a table. Then the answers are counted. Players get 3 points for a correct guess, one points if their guess is off by one.<br/>The game ends after 14 situations. The player with the most points wins the game.<br/>Suggested minimum number of players: 4<br/><br/>Example situation: <br/>Situation: &quot;The party is over. We've all been drinking.

After all, it isn't far and we can take back roads.&quot; <br/>&quot;B: We judge who's most likely to be capable of driving and decide on a driver that way.&quot; <br/>&quot;C: Under no circumstances am I going to drive or take a ride with a drunken driver.

A little celebration for the first big snow of the season. A worn hat topped its round head and stones made up its lop sided smile. The branches that made up the snow man&rsquo;s arms were absurdly long and would touch the ground if they hung down instead of sticking straight out to the sides. The eyes were made of red, broken colored glass as well and reflected the light of the moon that peeked out from behind the stormy clouds. The townsfolk felt they had built a masterpiece.<br/><br/>As the moon clouded over again the air turned suddenly much colder around the snow man. Then, a dull thud sounded though not loudly. The sound came from no discernable direction but seemed as if it was from all around. Of course, only the snow man would have heard it if it had ears.<br/><br/>Proceeding the thud by only a second a gray mist wafted up from what appear to be a crack in the very air itself. The mist swirled around the base of the snow man, climbing upwards and finally dissipating as the swirl crested the old worn hat.<br/><br/>The Snow man stood still but had a strange presence surrounding it. If one were to look now at the lopsided smile it had a malicious, sinister edge to it. The glassy eyes appeared to now have a dull, ruddy glow of their own.<br/><br/>For many minutes more the air around the snow remained colder than the chill air of the night. Then suddenly but slowly the head of the snow man turned of it&rsquo;s own accord to gaze at the soft, warm light from the window of the local tavern. The glass eyes reflected that light along with their own reddish glow. A glaring hatred becoming obvious. A hatred of the light, of the<br/>warmth of life.<br/><br/>Born of the darkest nightmares of earth, born in the time of the dark rift, the snow man had a fiendish intellect born to it as well and began to plot how to exact its hatred on this place of its creation. It never questioned the hatred itself. It knew only that it was driven to this end. To chase, to stalk and to kill all that held the light of life.<br/><br/>"}, "131424": {"rpgdesigner": ["Daniel Bayn", "Jason L.

In addition to a good mechanic this game can show off a peculiar look styled as picture post cards of the Russian 19th century lifestyle designed by Oleg Ershov.<br/>The game is of the sort when rules understanding takes 15 minutes but mastering of playing skills requires indefinite time.<br/><br/>You will play a role of a pre-revolutionary businessman beating up among the winds of city life and trying to make money in these fickle conditions &ndash; you are not surprised, are you? Bargaining with proper people, using contacts and getting biggest profit by turning the circumstances to your own advantage.<br/>The most skilled merchant wins the game. And what is the better evidence of business success then undertaking profit? That&rsquo;s why the winning point counters look like cash notes and for the mostly successful ones &ndash; like gold bar cards.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Each player acquires two &ldquo;\u0424\u0430\u0440\u0442&rdquo; cards, one &ldquo;Big \u0424\u0430\u0440\u0442&rdquo; card and 10 more cards with random characters (8 cards if there are five players). Characters have positive and negative values. The first ones add the winning points, the others withdraw. &ldquo;Student&rdquo; is a special character which has a neutral, zero value. These two card types differ at the back so as to know how many &ldquo;\u0424\u0430\u0440\u0442&rdquo; cards each player has at the hand. Players shouldn&rsquo;t hide this information.<br/><br/>Define by any suitable way who will start the game. Further the turn will dispose clockwise. In your game-business action several card piles will be formed &ndash; one for each player and one in the center. Only upper cards make sense during the game.<br/><br/>Player should put a card from his hand during his turn. Cards with positive or negative values can be placed to the own pile or at the center. &ldquo;Student&rdquo; card can be placed to any pile except the one with upper &ldquo;\u0424\u0430\u0440\u0442&rdquo; or &ldquo;Big \u0444\u0430\u0440\u0442&rdquo; card on it. These cards can be played only to the own card piles.<br/><br/>When you&rsquo;ve got all needed contacts and character positions at the table brings you delight and rejoicing, it&rsquo;s time to catch up a moment of gain and hit the jackpot playing &ldquo;\u0424\u0430\u0440\u0442&rdquo; or &ldquo;Big \u0444\u0430\u0440\u0442&rdquo; card. It&rsquo;s placed near player&rsquo;s pile and incites the instant count of all cards values at the table. Sum up the positive values, subtract negative and acquire or lose the sum of cash notes equal to the outcome. It&rsquo;s simple! Though not as simple as it seems because all other &ldquo;\u0424\u0430\u0440\u0442&rdquo; cards at the table also work at this moment. In this case their owners are swept over the commercial tide and they get or lose the congruous sum of banknotes. If &ldquo;Big \u0444\u0430\u0440\u0442&rdquo; has been played or provoked the sum of points, positive and negative as well, doubles.<br/><br/>When everyone plays all the cards the round ends. Then there can be more rounds at will. The amount of rounds can be equal to the number of players to let everyone to make the first turn for the most unbiased result.<br/><br/>Firstly, the game is logical so the word &laquo;\u0444\u0430\u0440\u0442&raquo; obtains a bit different meaning then luck or risk. It can be associated with business acumen, enterprise and skill to use the chance.

The players take role of the owners and leaders of orbital mining battle stations, which are hunting for rich uranium deposits in an asteroid belt.<br/><br/>Since there is not enough uranium for everyone, the players have to fight with other space explorers for every asteroid. By using a rich armory of defensive and offensive measures and a loyal crew of their own clones, the player will have to survive a terrible battle and do everything to be first to put the other player out of action.<br/><br/>This game is completely unique. Imagine a turn-based game in the Tower Defence genre, where you must not only protect your own prosperity, but also send waves of attackers in your opponent's direction!<br/><br/>How do you play?<br/><br/>The station is not automated, which makes it much more reliable but at the same time requires a crew for manual operation. The player rolls a die, which determines the distance that one of his obedient clones can travel to the required section, to activate a piece of equipment or a weapon which is installed there. The choice of clones and the goal will depend on the current situation and the player's long-term strategy.<br/><br/>The station is completely autonomous. The player can mine and process resources, carry out repairs, defrost new clones to increase the size of his crew &mdash; but it's not that easy when you are being attacked by your opponent's entire battle force, and you want to teach them a lesson...<br/><br/>The player wins when he puts the other player's station completely out of action.<br/><br/>Why should I play Septikon?<br/><br/><br/>    It's original. Are you looking for something new? We can guarantee that you have never seen a game like this one!<br/>    It's well developed. Like a good brandy, our game was in development for 12 years &mdash; that's 12 years of constant testing and thousands of matches played.<br/>    It's dynamic. Sid Meier said, &quot;A game is a series of interesting choices.&quot; Septikon will not overload or bore you into a stupor. Of course, the player has something to think about every turn, but he has only a limited number of optimal choices. That means that you won't spend too much time waiting your turn.<br/>    It&rsquo;s multi-faceted: Consider a whole range of strategies that all deserve to be tried out:<br/>        Burning. Burn through the opponent&rsquo;s battle station with your lasers, cutting him off his supplies, ammunition and oxygen.<br/>        Suppression. Destroy his battle sections and maintenance modules, block his shooters and stop him from recovering.<br/>        Landing. Attack your enemy with a squad of fully armored and equipped BioDrones. Let them rip through his defenses.<br/>        Exhaustion. Destroy your opponent&rsquo;s strategic resources with quick targeted attacks and sneaky diversions, and while he is trying to recover, create an invincible army.<br/>        Massacre. Focus your entire production on creating nuclear charges. Suppress the opponent&rsquo;s defenses and drown him in a nuclear fog.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>What's in the box?<br/><br/><br/>    24 clone figures (in two different colors). Each one of them will obediently carry out all your orders and activate different station modules.<br/>    160 wooden cubes, representing resources which will be needed to run the station and keep it safe: Oxygen, Metal, Rockets, BioMass, Energy, BioDrones and &mdash; obviously &mdash; Uranium;<br/>    4 nuclear Rockets for those who like it hot;<br/>    8 satellite tokens and 8 Energy Shield tokens &mdash; efficient measures for launching your own space-to-space grid;<br/>    80 damage tokens &mdash; during the space battles stations will take a lot of damage, and many sections will be competely put out of action;<br/>    1 huge game board with two stations and some space between them;<br/>    2 six-sided dice, which in this game are called Random Number Generators. A single roll at the beginning of the turn will determine the &quot;time period&quot; which the player can use this turn.<br/>    2 books &mdash; One, consisting of just 2 pages, contains the Intro Game Rules, the other, the full rules (8 pages).<br/><br/><br/>How did the game come to life?<br/><br/>Igrology is one of most successful Russian board game developers. We have created 18 products, many of which are constantly being re-published. In 2011, we have sold over 100,000 copies in total in Russia.<br/><br/>Now we are facing a new task, to bring unique ideas to the international games' market. Septikon is the first and very important step for us in that direction.<br/><br/>Septikon was created by the Russian game designer Konstantin Seleznev and polished by 12 years of work and thousands of matches. In 2011, Igrology noticed this original game at the Moscow Games Convention &quot;Igroteka Avtorov&quot;, where all other publishers did not pay a lot of attention to it due to its very unusual concept and seemingly complicated game board.<br/><br/>The Igrology team, together with the game author, spent almost a year creating a setting, fine-tuning game rules, and polishing the design. Now, we have the pleasure of bringing it to all board game fans.<br/><br/>During the next year we will be releasing the first expansion, as well as an iPad version of Septikon.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "English Print & Play edition", "Russian first edition"], "average": "6.65227", "name": "Septikon: Uranium Wars", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "97", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "131458": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1435765.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Friedemann Friese"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Lars-Arne \"Maura\" Kalusky"], "boardgamepublisher": ["2F-Spiele", "Arclight", "W.

What remains of the uninfected British population is confined to the islands around the mainland, a &lsquo;safe distance&rsquo; across the water from where this strange phenomenon has taken place. Northern Ireland has joined up with Eire through necessity as much as anything else and the largest remaining, unaffected population is to be found on the Isle of Wight in the south.<br/><br/>Britain is lost. Its population is lost.<br/><br/>Lost, but still there.<br/><br/>The country is still there, the buildings, roads, factories and schools underneath the overlay of people&rsquo;s imaginings, sometimes shaping and inspiring them. The people are still there, too &ndash; those who survive their own nightmares, drifting aimlessly, caught up in their own fictions, living, psychic batteries giving form and personality to their dreams.<br/><br/>Some are aware. Lucid dreamers. Able to shape the world around them. Some of them, typically children or those with particularly strong imaginations, shape the world around them much more strongly, subsuming and controlling the imaginations of others.<br/><br/>Collectively, people&rsquo;s imaginations are channelled and formed by the media they consumed before the disaster. One might find talking rabbits at Watership Down or any number of local legends and rumours brought to life from serial killers and vampires to dragons and ghosts.<br/><br/>Britain is blockaded by a multinational task force and ex-patriots who, if they choose to return to the islands, may never leave again. What&rsquo;s left of British money and power is devoted to holding this quarantine zone and working towards a solution. The problem is that very few people are immune, only the mindless, or those who were already broken in some way. Monstrous, terrible things are being done in the name of saving the country. Those few individuals who can enter the zone of effect without being warped, twisted or subsumed, those who can control this new, mutable, amorphous reality are particularly valuable. Sent into the mainland they search for answers, try to rescue people and just try to make sense of what has happened.<br/><br/>You play the part of one of these scouts.

Apr&egrave;s tout, on ne donne pas l'assaut de la m&ecirc;me mani&egrave;re &agrave; un squat d&eacute;labr&eacute; de Palos Verdes et &agrave; un manoir cinq &eacute;toiles de Bel Air, &agrave; moins de vouloir quitter la sc&egrave;ne du crime les pieds devant ! Sous l'&eacute;gide du sergent Pat 'Hook' Finey, ce sont six mod&egrave;les d' habitations qui sont analys&eacute;s, du plus rago&ucirc;tant au plus luxueux : les zones normalement d&eacute;sertes (&eacute;gouts, carri&egrave;res et d&eacute;charges publiques/priv&eacute;es), les squats (v&eacute;ritables plaies pour la police, tant il est facile pour les squatters de passer au travers du crible lors d'une intervention), les caravanes et bateaux, les appartements, les pavillons et enfin les domaines - analyse suivie de conseils aussi bien techniques que tactiques (o&ugrave; fouiller, o&ugrave; ne surtout pas mettre les pieds, les endroits auxquels on oublie de penser, quel type de mur arr&ecirc;te ou non les balles en cas de fusillade, quels syst&egrave;mes de s&eacute;curit&eacute; va-t-on rencontrer, quels dangers pr&eacute;sentent ces derniers, qu'est-ce qu'une Panic Room, etc.) ainsi que de quelques plans-types de maisons et appartements. L'expos&eacute; s'ach&egrave;ve sur trois lieux de passage pr&eacute;f&eacute;r&eacute;s des Californiens : la banque, la sup&eacute;rette et enfin le mall (gigantesque centre commercial), d&eacute;cortiqu&eacute;s et vus sous l'angle de la s&eacute;curit&eacute; et des risques encourus lors d'un braquage.<br/><br/>Les deux sections suivantes s'int&eacute;ressent aux laiss&eacute;s pour compte de LA : les sans-abris et les l&eacute;gions d'ouvriers anonymes. Un million de hobos et homeless (SDF) hantent la ville. La moiti&eacute; vit dans des squats, l'autre se d&eacute;brouille tant bien que mal, et tous vivent du troc (paradoxalement, une m&eacute;thode qui se r&eacute;pand peu &agrave; peu dans toutes les couches sociales, au grand dam des services financiers et fiscaux), avec les centres d'accueil publics ou religieux pour points de chute ; centres sur lesquels les gangs de hobos veillent au grain... Le sort des ouvriers n'est gu&egrave;re plus reluisant, enferm&eacute;s dans des Blocs, de vastes immeubles abritant chacun plusieurs milliers d'individus en vase clos, aux mains de leurs entreprises. Ici, un seul mot d'ordre : docilit&eacute;, au travail comme au dortoir ; docilit&eacute; encore, quand il s'agit de faire une descente arm&eacute;e dans le Bloc d'une autre corporation ou une balade dans un Bloc f&eacute;minin, pour rel&acirc;cher la pression.<br/><br/>Suite du voyage au plus profond de la mis&egrave;re, avec les cloaques de LA, d&eacute;vor&eacute;s par le Gob et la Grey Plague. On apprend ici quelles sont les origines et les diff&eacute;rentes cons&eacute;quences de ces deux fl&eacute;aux sur l'organisme humain, tandis que la soci&eacute;t&eacute; s'ent&ecirc;te le plus souvent &agrave; ne rien voir ou savoir. Ce sera &eacute;galement l'occasion de r&eacute;pondre &agrave; des questions telles que : qui agit ? Qui aurait d&ucirc; agir ? A qui profite la situation ? Seulement, les pauvres et les contamin&eacute;s ont appris &agrave; se serrer les coudes et &agrave; survivre au quotidien, regroup&eacute;s en communaut&eacute;s de &quot;gobelins&quot;, de &quot;greensters&quot; ou de &quot;bouffe-poussi&egrave;res&quot;. Les cops bien avis&eacute;s t&acirc;cheront de mettre la main sur un &quot;feu-follet&quot;, un guide en d'autres termes, pour naviguer au milieu de cette faune bigarr&eacute;e, bien loin des immeubles resplendissants de Downtown...<br/><br/>Autres parias de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; californienne : les Natifs, partag&eacute;s entre tradition et modernit&eacute;. Tandis que leurs fr&egrave;res de l'Union sont parqu&eacute;s en camps de concentration (ou peu s'en faut), les Indiens de Californie, d&eacute;&ccedil;us par les promesses non-tenues de l'Ind&eacute;pendance, peinent &agrave; trouver un point de ralliement, divis&eacute;s entre &quot;Pommes&quot; (terme p&eacute;joratif indien pour les Natifs d&eacute;racin&eacute;s et int&eacute;gr&eacute;s &agrave; la soci&eacute;t&eacute; blanche), habitants des r&eacute;serves et activistes - pacifiques pour les uns, violents pour les autres. Cette section est &eacute;maill&eacute;e de plusieurs encarts, pr&eacute;sentant l'histoire du peuple indien depuis la d&eacute;couverte de l'Am&eacute;rique, les administrations (avant et apr&egrave;s l'Ind&eacute;pendance) charg&eacute;es des affaires indiennes, les rituels et c&eacute;r&eacute;monies des Natifs, leurs leaders spirituels et politiques, les polices tribales, ainsi que plusieurs pages d&eacute;di&eacute;es &agrave; l'enclave ind&eacute;pendante du Nevada et aux conditions de vie des Natifs au sein et en dehors des &quot;plaines de b&eacute;ton&quot;, les cit&eacute;s californiennes.<br/><br/>A l'exact oppos&eacute; des classes populaires et des Natifs, voici les trusts, consortiums et corporations bas&eacute;s en Californie, aux revenus (et souvent m&eacute;thodes) proprement scandaleux. C'est le cas de Du Pont, n&deg;1 mondial incontest&eacute; de la chimie (entre autres domaines), mod&egrave;le de la r&eacute;ussite &agrave; l'am&eacute;ricaine, farouchement attach&eacute;e aux valeurs morales de l'Union et pourtant implant&eacute;e en Californie. C'est &eacute;galement le cas de Sentry Corp, la plus vaste entreprise du globe, propri&eacute;taire du Lib&eacute;ria et d'innombrables firmes et usines &agrave; travers le monde. Los Angeles se flatte de poss&eacute;der le si&egrave;ge social de ce titan in&eacute;branlable. De m&ecirc;me pour les quatre multinationales de la nanotechnologie, pour lesquelles tous les coups sont permis afin de garder une infime longueur d'avance, peu importe le domaine d'application, le textile comme l'armement, un secteur o&ugrave; les accidents f&acirc;cheux sont &eacute;trangement nombreux. Enfin, vous aussi, &quot;Vivez greeeeeeeen !&quot; avec CaSaPha, leader californien de la di&eacute;t&eacute;tique, des cures d'amaigrissement et de l'alimentation branch&eacute;e, qui prend une revanche sur la Grey Plague &agrave; sa mani&egrave;re... Et &agrave; c&ocirc;t&eacute; de ces quatre r&eacute;ussites insolentes, un cas bien &agrave; part : Avers Weapons, autrefois brillante armurerie familiale, qui r&eacute;alisa notamment le Compact Uni et le Colt Afrikaneer pour les besoins des cops, et dont la faillite soudaine (pr&eacute;cipit&eacute;e diront certains) suscite bien des questions, &eacute;galement aupr&egrave;s du COPS. Mais la presse-poubelle veille...<br/><br/>S'ensuit une large rubrique, consacr&eacute;e (titre du suppl&eacute;ment oblige) &agrave; la technologie des ann&eacute;es 2030. Entrez dans les Temps Modernes !

After all, it does not attack the same way to a dilapidated squat Palos Verdes mansion and a five-star Bel Air, unless you want to leave the crime scene feet first! Under the auspices of Sergeant Pat 'Hook' Finey, there are six styles of homes that are analyzed, the more appetizing to the most luxurious: normally deserted areas (sewers, quarries and landfills / private), squats (real wounds for the police, as it is easier for squatters to move through the screen during an intervention), caravans and boats, apartments, flats, and finally the areas - analysis followed advice both technical and tactical (where search, where especially not set foot, places that we forget to think about what kind of wall stops or not bullets when shooting, what security systems are going to meet, what dangers they present, that 'Is it a Panic Room, etc..) and some standard plans of houses and apartments. The paper concludes with three passageways favorite Californians: bank, supermarket and finally the mall (huge shopping center), and shelled from the perspective of safety and risks during a robbery.<br/><br/>The next two sections are concerned with left behind in LA: the homeless and the legions of anonymous workers. One million homeless and hobos (SDF) haunt the city. Half live in squats, the other is doing as well as possible, and all live barter (paradoxically, a method that spreads gradually in all social strata, to the chagrin of financial services and tax), with reception centers for public or religious points fall; centers on which gangs hobos ensure grain ... The plight of workers is hardly brighter enclosed in blocks, large buildings, each housing several thousand individuals in isolation at the hands of their businesses. Here, a single slogan: docility, to work as the dormitory docility even when it comes to raid the army block another corporation or a walk in the block female, to relieve pressure .<br/><br/>Following the trip to the deepest misery, with the sewers of LA, devoured by Gob and Grey Plague. We learn here what are the origins and the different consequences of these two scourges of the human body, while the company insists most often see or know nothing. This will also be the opportunity to answer questions such as: who is? Who should act? Who benefits from the situation? Only the poor and contaminated learned to stick together and survive daily, divided into communities of &quot;goblins&quot; of &quot;greensters&quot; or &quot;food-dust.&quot; The cops will try to do well to get hold of a &quot;fire-wisp&quot;, a guide in other words, to navigate through this colorful fauna, far resplendent buildings of Downtown ...<br/><br/>Other outcasts California: the Native torn between tradition and modernity. While their brothers of the Union are penned into concentration camps (or nearly so), the California Indians, disappointed by the broken promises of independence, struggling to find a rallying point, divided between &quot;Apples&quot; (derogatory term for Native Indian uprooted and integrated into white society), reserve residents and activists - some peaceful, others violent. This section is dotted with several inserts, presenting the history of the Indian people since the discovery of America, the government (before and after Independence) responsible for Indian Affairs, Native rituals and ceremonies, their spiritual and political leaders , tribal policies, as well as several pages dedicated to independent enclave of Nevada and the lives of Native within and outside the &quot;plain concrete&quot;, cities in California.<br/><br/>At the exact opposite of the popular classes and Native Here trusts, corporations and consortia based in California, income (and often methods) outrageous. This is the case of Du Pont No. 1 undisputed world chemistry (among other areas), a model of success in the U.S., fiercely committed to the moral values \u200b\u200bof the Union and yet located in California. This is also the case for Sentry Corp., the largest company in the world, owner of Liberia and countless firms and factories around the world. Los Angeles boasts of having the headquarters of this titan unwavering. Same for the four multinational nanotechnology, where all shots are allowed to keep a small step ahead, regardless of the application domain, such as arming textiles, a sector where unfortunate accidents are strangely many. Finally, you too, &quot;greeeeeeeen Live!&quot; with CaSaPha leader Californian diet, weight-loss and power connected, taking revenge on the Grey Plague in its own way ... And besides these four insolent success, although a case apart: Avers Weapons, Armory once brilliant family who made including Compact Colt Afrikaneer Kingdom and for the needs of cops, whose sudden failure (precipitated some would say) raises many questions, also to the PSC. But the press garbage before ...<br/><br/>Follows a large section devoted (OCCS requires) the technology of the 2030s. Enter the Modern Times! Honor to the general, with a brief description of the California energy resources, various hi-tech transport (on wheels, rails, on sea and in the air), the progress of the holo-technology like wireless. Section is then divided into specialized sections: <br/><br/>     biotechnology, whether cutaneous implants advertising, animals or genetically modified organisms (pass on the many failures and setbacks). <br/>     Nanotechnology, with its applications in medicine, architecture, electronics, safety and textiles: bright Hawaiian shirt self-heating! <br/>     The computer (as quantum classical), with sub-branches home automation, hardware and databases. Section is accompanied by a table comparing the merits of different computers currently on the market (desktops, laptops and palms) and a description of the computer system on board each vehicle LAPD (the MPTS - Mobile Police Tactical System) servers available to the police. <br/>     Electronics, with developments on the various modes of communication (Network, phones, laptops and subcutaneous radio networks, video) and a list of equipment monitoring / spying (such as audio video), scrambling, encryption and security, plus a range of equipment for helicopters ASD. <br/>     Response equipment (burglary might say in other hands), which includes both the hammer and pincers that yes-cards and acetylene torches, not to mention the various protocols of hacking (in this respect, one can find details about the lives and problems of computer manipulations most useful data download to repair a workstation). <br/>     Robotics, which includes the very first prototypes of robots and drones (more popular), cat mechanical copy of the C-3PO (which animates recently the Oscars perfectly), the multi-tasking model robot Labor, for implementation on Mars MechaCop project, which is still lacking. <br/>     And finally So-Cyb (or Cybernetic Soft), which depicts the failure of the patent Cybernetic Hard (read cybernetics iconic cyberpunk movement) and the alternatives offered by the use of implants minors - temporary (pins soft) or permanent (hard pin) - all with six models So-Cyb equipment and a table summarizing the complexity (and dangerous) the siting of a spindle hard.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Now turn to the penultimate chapter: current affairs, with two key scenarios - respectively entitled &quot;Predators&quot; and &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; - which the cops will face to face with baskets of crabs that are the worlds of politics and financial, with two murders prologue. Tact and finesse required!<br/><br/>Finally, once is not customary in the range PSC, the supplement section ends with the LAPD Blues tense atmosphere on the 35th floor, with the highlight being indicted by the SAD of Thomas cops 'Sniper' O'Doole - the entire unit is on the teeth, there will comptes&agrave; make ...<br/><br/>"}, "131009": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["Base set of 80 cards plus promos"], "poll": [], "name": "Drow Treachery (Fortune Cards)", "rpgartist": ["John Tyler Christopher", "Michael Faille", "Victoria Maderna", "Federico Piatti"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1425241.jpg", "usersrated": "4", "rpgsetting": ["Underdark"], "rpgproducer": ["Mari Kolkowsky"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (4th Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Wizards of the Coast"], "average": "5.1875", "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["D&D Fortune Cards"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1425241_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/>What Are Friends For?<br/><br/>To survive the perils of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Roleplaying Game, you need to keep your friends close... and betray them when the time is right.

Le titre, que l'on peut traduire par &quot;Le grand chaos&quot;, est une r&eacute;f&eacute;rence directe aux mots laiss&eacute;s par Charles Manson et sa famille dans l'appartement de Leno et Rosemary La Bianca, assassin&eacute;s le 9 ao&ucirc;t 1969 - soit le lendemain du meurtre de Sharon Tate. Sous-titr&eacute; &quot;Saison 1 - mai / juin 2031&quot;, cet ouvrage s'attarde sur la description des moeurs mystiques de la Californie, avec tout ce que cela comporte de d&eacute;viances, de sexualit&eacute;s d&eacute;brid&eacute;es et de criminalit&eacute;s &agrave; l'avenant. Le suppl&eacute;ment propose ensuite deux sc&eacute;narios dont l'un s'inscrit dans la chronologie du jeu, avant de terminer sur les br&egrave;ves de la vie quotidienne du commissariat. L'ensemble du volume est &eacute;maill&eacute; de cinq nouvelles.<br/><br/>Le premier chapitre (2 pages) n'est qu'une br&egrave;ve introduction, sous le titre &quot;Roll call&quot;. On y trouve une explication de la ligne &eacute;ditoriale d'un suppl&eacute;ment au contenu plut&ocirc;t prompt &agrave; faire hurler au scandale, tant dans les textes que dans les illustrations. Apr&egrave;s une demi-page d'avertissement, le reste du chapitre ne contient que la nouvelle d'introduction.<br/><br/>Le deuxi&egrave;me chapitre (125 pages) constitue le coeur du suppl&eacute;ment, ainsi que l'indique son titre, &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;. Les douze parties qui le composent traitent principalement des cultes, sectes et autres mystiques de la Californie, avant de passer &agrave; tout ce qui touche la sexualit&eacute;.<br/><br/>     &quot;Cultes de la mort&quot; (10 pages) d&eacute;crit les cultes am&eacute;rindiens et m&eacute;so-am&eacute;rindiens &agrave; travers une pr&eacute;sentation m&eacute;langeant r&eacute;f&eacute;rences historiques et int&eacute;gration aux ann&eacute;es 2030. Les aspects culturels sont abord&eacute;s en premier. Ainsi, plusieurs groupes sont pr&eacute;sent&eacute;s : Yaqui, Otomi, Huichol, Nahua et Cora mais aussi Zapot&egrave;ques, Olm&egrave;ques et Azt&egrave;ques, auxquels on rajoutera l'Aztec Mafia. Le c&ocirc;t&eacute; mystique vient en second &agrave; travers la description des croyances modernes et des objets, rituels et symboles de culte. Enfin, cette partie se termine sur la pr&eacute;sentation de trois cultes criminels li&eacute;s aux divinit&eacute;s azt&egrave;ques.<br/>     &quot;Cultes afro-am&eacute;ricains&quot; (10 pages) suit un mod&egrave;le similaire aux cultes de la mort en pr&eacute;sentant cette fois les cultes afro-br&eacute;siliens (candombl&eacute;, macumba, umbanda), afro-cubains (santer&igrave;a, palo mayombe, secte Abakua), le vaudou et le rastafarisme.<br/>     &quot;Mysticisme religieux en Californie&quot; (13 pages) se concentre sur les mysticismes issus des grandes religions r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute;es pr&eacute;sentes &agrave; Los Angeles en commen&ccedil;ant par le juda&iuml;sme californien, avec des pr&eacute;cisions sur la ville mythique d'Agarttha, la kabbale ou les golems. Vient ensuite le christianisme californien et les ordres qui se situent dans sa marge - comme les Francs-ma&ccedil;ons, l'Opus Dei ou les Rose-Croix, ainsi que les sectes et courants protestants. Cette partie s'ach&egrave;ve sur un paragraphe traitant des Manuscrits de la mer morte.<br/>     &quot;Sectes &quot; (11 pages) prend le parti de la description du fonctionnement et de l'organisation d'une secte &agrave; travers des exemples historiques : institut Moon, &eacute;glise de Scientologie, Ra&euml;l Inc., Soka Gakkai. Chacune d'entre elles est pr&eacute;sent&eacute;e au travers d'une fiche signal&eacute;tique rassemblant la plupart des informations consultables et les &eacute;tendant jusqu'aux ann&eacute;es 2030. La description g&eacute;n&eacute;rale mentionne ainsi les statuts officiels, les activit&eacute;s (ouvertes et occultes, l'int&eacute;gration, l'&eacute;volution et la dispersion des fid&egrave;les, les diff&eacute;rents lieux du culte. Les aspects juridiques, financiers et judiciaires ne sont pas oubli&eacute;s.<br/>     &quot;Le satanisme&quot; (12 pages) est d&eacute;crit comme un m&eacute;lange de religion et de courant philosophique. Apr&egrave;s un retour sur l'historique du mouvement le texte s'attarde sur The church of Satan et son &eacute;manation californienne. Les sectes sataniques d&eacute;voyant le culte originel sont ensuite trait&eacute;es. Il est &agrave; noter que cette partie comporte bon nombre d'encadr&eacute;s volumineux mettant en lumi&egrave;re certains points, notamment les diff&eacute;rences existant entre la religion sataniste - &agrave; l'oppos&eacute; du dogme chr&eacute;tien - et l'amalgame qui est fait au nom de Satan avec quantit&eacute; d'autres mouvements criminels ou d'individus isol&eacute;s.<br/>     &quot;Californie, terre d'asile(s)&quot; (14 pages) pr&eacute;sente plusieurs mouvements &agrave; part, tir&eacute;s de courants historiques ou pas et remis &agrave; la sauce des ann&eacute;es 2030. Cette partie ouvre sur une variante du style de vie bouddhiste dans lequel des pilules commercialis&eacute;es garantissent le Nirvana. Entrent ensuite en sc&egrave;ne les math&eacute;magiciens aux buts obscurs mais qui, gr&acirc;ce &agrave; leurs talents en math&eacute;matique et informatique, d&eacute;tournent de grandes quantit&eacute;s d'argent servant &agrave; se payer du pouvoir. Les courant suivants sont le culte du Cafard et les Ktulies, d&eacute;j&agrave; tous deux &eacute;voqu&eacute;s dans le pilote de la gamme et ici approfondis. Les Skoptzy leur embo&icirc;tent le pas apr&egrave;s avoir &eacute;t&eacute; le sujet d'une br&egrave;ve dans le premier Ground Zero (prozine &agrave; destination des joueurs &eacute;dit&eacute; sur abonnement par Asmod&eacute;e).<br/>     &quot;D&eacute;programmation&quot; (12 pages) commence par d&eacute;crire les m&eacute;canismes de cette science des manipulations mentales avant d'aborder les diff&eacute;rents organismes l&eacute;gaux charg&eacute;s de lutter contre. Un encadr&eacute; propose trois nouveaux stages de communication m&eacute;diatique : stage respect du culte, stage expert en communication et stage mass guru. Viennent ensuite la description des Karma Leaders, un groupe ill&eacute;gal sp&eacute;cialis&eacute; dans la d&eacute;programmation et op&eacute;rant &agrave; son compte, et celle de l'Alliance, un mouvement luttant ill&eacute;galement contre les int&eacute;grismes et les fanatismes religieux. Santa Cruz et East Method compl&egrave;tent le tableau de ces groupuscules en monnayant leurs d&eacute;programmations.<br/>     &quot;La vie sexuelle des Californiens en 2030&quot; (9 pages) dresse, comme son nom l'indique, un panorama complet des moeurs sexuelles dans la Californie de COPS. Sont ainsi d&eacute;crits la fa&ccedil;on dont le sexe s'envisage &agrave; Los Angeles en 2030, quelle place y occupe le porno, comment le g&egrave;rent les medias et quels en sont les d&eacute;tracteurs. La partie se conclut sur la nouvelle &quot;La femme sans ombre&quot;.<br/>     &quot;Paraphilies, d&eacute;lits et crimes sexuels&quot; (12 pages) survole l'ensemble des sexualit&eacute;s parall&egrave;les que l'on peut trouver en Californie avant de se focaliser sur l'aspect l&eacute;gal de celles-ci. Ainsi, au rayon des nuisances sexuelles sont d&eacute;taill&eacute;s l'exhibitionnisme, le voyeurisme et le f&eacute;tichisme. Le texte propose ensuite une approche de la criminalit&eacute; ordinaire envisag&eacute;e sous l'aspect paraphilique avant de s'attarder sur les violeurs, tortionnaires et autres n&eacute;crophiles ou n&eacute;crophages. La partie se conclut sur la nouvelle &quot;Souvenirs de la maison des morts&quot;.<br/>     &quot;Les tueurs en s&eacute;rie&quot; (13 pages) revient plus longuement sur un sujet d&eacute;j&agrave; abord&eacute; dans le premier suppl&eacute;ment de la saison, Saison 1-1 (Juillet 2030): Amiti\u00e9s de Los Angeles. Les diff&eacute;rents types de tueurs pathologiques (mass murderers, serial killers, spree killers, lust killers, thrill killers, comfort killers) et leurs motivations sont d&eacute;taill&eacute;s. Une partie du chapitre est consacr&eacute;e &agrave; la traque et &agrave; l'arrestation des tueurs en s&eacute;rie. Un 10-18 et la nouvelle &quot;Le ch&acirc;teau de Barbe-Bleue&quot; concluent la partie.<br/>     &quot;P&eacute;docriminalit&eacute;&quot; (8 pages) pr&eacute;sente l'&eacute;ventail des criminalit&eacute;s li&eacute;es &agrave; l'enfance en Californie. En premier lieu on trouve les tol&eacute;rances p&eacute;dosympathiques du Los Angeles de 2030 avant d'encha&icirc;ner sur les diff&eacute;rentes formes d'esclavage et de trafic infantiles. La pornographie et la prostitution terminent cette approche et laissent la place &agrave; la pr&eacute;sentation des organismes de lutte contre la p&eacute;docriminalit&eacute;, pour finir sur les exc&egrave;s de la protection de l'enfance.<br/>     &quot;Snuff movies&quot; (2 pages) survole le march&eacute; et la client&egrave;le des snuff movies en Californie, ainsi que le rapport qu'entretiennent les COPS avec ce milieu.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Le troisi&egrave;me chapitre s'intitule &quot;Affaires en cours&quot; (38 pages) et regroupe les deux sc&eacute;narios du suppl&eacute;ment, chacun s'appuyant sur les ressources fournies dans le suppl&eacute;ment.<br/><br/>     &quot;Et un lichen leur montrera la voie...&quot; (17 pages) ne prend pas pied directement dans la chronologie du jeu. Le sc&eacute;nario tourne autour de la grey plague et s'int&eacute;ressera &agrave; une firme pharmaceutique sans pour autant que les joueurs puissent changer grand-chose &agrave; ses activit&eacute;s.<br/>     &quot;Un homme est mort&quot; (21 pages) sert de transition entre les deux premi&egrave;res saisons de COPS puisque c'est au cours de ce sc&eacute;nario que les joueurs d&eacute;couvriront un &eacute;l&eacute;ment important, une r&eacute;v&eacute;lation dans la toile de fond du jeu.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>&quot;LAPD Blues&quot; conclut une nouvelle fois le suppl&eacute;ment en proposant quelques extraits de la vie du commissariat. La vie du commissariat, ce sont des br&egrave;ves (dat&eacute;es avec mention de l'heure) que les joueurs peuvent entendre en se baladant dans les locaux de leur QG. Cette derni&egrave;re partie se termine par la nouvelle &quot;Kindert&ouml;ten Lieder&quot;.<br/><br/><br/>Translation courtesy of Google:<br/><br/>Helter Skelter is the sixth and concluding supplement covering the first season of COPS. The title, which translates as &quot;The great chaos,&quot; is a direct reference to the words left by Charles Manson and his family in the apartment of Leno and Rosemary La Bianca, killed Aug. 9, 1969 - the day after the murder of Sharon Tate. Subtitled &quot;Season 1 - May / June 2031&quot;, the book focuses on the description of manners mystical California, with all that implies in terms of deviations of unbridled sexuality and criminality to match. The supplement then proposes two scenarios, one of which fits into the timeline of the game, before ending the brief life of the police. The entire volume is studded with five new.<br/><br/>The first chapter (2 pages) is only a brief introduction, under the title &quot;Roll call&quot;. There is an explanation of the editorial content of a supplement to rather quick to scream scandal in both the texts in the illustrations. After a half-page warning the rest of the chapter contains only the new introduction.<br/>The second chapter (125 pages) is the heart of the supplement, as its title indicates, &quot;Helter Skelter.&quot; Twelve parts which deal primarily consist of cults, sects and mystical California, before moving on to anything related to sexuality.<br/><br/>     &quot;Cults of Death&quot; (10 pages) describes cults and Native Meso-American Indians through a presentation mixing historical references and integrating the 2030s. Cultural aspects are addressed first. Thus, several groups are presented: Yaqui, Otomi, Huichol, Nahua and Cora but Zapotec, Olmec and Aztec, which we will add the Aztec Mafia. The mystique comes second through the description of objects and modern beliefs, rituals and symbols of worship. Finally, this section ends with the presentation of three worship Aztec gods associated with criminals.<br/>     &quot;Afro-American Religions&quot; (10 pages) follows a similar pattern to the cults of death this time with Afro-Brazilian cults (Candombl&eacute;, Macumba, Umbanda) Afro-Cuban (Santeria, Palo mayombe sect Abaku&aacute;) Voodoo and Rastafari.<br/>     &quot;Religious Mysticism in California&quot; (13 pages) focuses on mysticism from the great revealed religions present in Los Angeles, California beginning with Judaism, with details of the mythical city of Agarttha, Kabbalah or golems. Then Christianity California and orders which are within its range - such as the Freemasons, Opus Dei or the Rosicrucians, and the Protestant sects and currents. This part ends with a paragraph dealing with the Dead Sea Scrolls.<br/>     &quot;Cults&quot; (11 pages) takes advantage of the description of the functioning and organization of a sect through historical examples: Moon institute, Church of Scientology, Inc. Rael., Soka Gakkai. Each is presented through an MSDS information gathering most viewed and extending to the year 2030. General description mentions the statutes and official activities (open and hidden, integration, evolution and dispersal of the faithful, the different places of worship.'s Legal, financial and law are not forgotten.<br/>     &quot;Satanism&quot; (12 pages) is described as a mixture of religion and philosophical. After returning to the history of the movement focuses on text The church of Satan and his emanation California. Satanic cults d&eacute;voyant original worship are then processed. It should be noted that this part has many large boxes highlighting certain points, particularly the differences between religion Satanist - the opposite of Christian dogma - and the confusion that is done in the name of Satan with quantity other criminal movements or individuals.<br/>     &quot;California, land of asylum (s)&quot; (14 pages) presents several movements apart, drawn from historical trends or not delivered to the sauce and 2030s. This section begins with a variant of the Buddhist lifestyle in which pills marketed ensure Nirvana. Then enter the stage math&eacute;magiciens goals obscure but which, thanks to their talent in mathematics and computer away large amounts of money to pay for power. The following are the current cult of Cockroach and Ktulies, both already mentioned in the pilot of the range and depth here. The Skoptzy their footsteps after being the subject of a short in the first Ground Zero (prozine bound players Asmodeus published on subscription).<br/>     &quot;Deprogramming&quot; (12 pages) begins by describing the mechanisms of the science of mental manipulation before addressing the various legal bodies responsible for fighting against. A box offers three new courses communication media: stage respect of worship, training and communication expert training guru mass. Followed by the description of Karma Leaders, a group specializing in illegal deprogramming and operating on his own, and that of the Alliance, a movement fighting illegally against fundamentalism and religious fanaticism. Method and East Santa Cruz complete the picture of these small groups by marketing their deprogramming.<br/>     &quot;The sex lives of Californians in 2030&quot; (9 pages) provides, as its name suggests, a comprehensive overview of sexual mores in California COPS. Are thus described how sex is considered to Los Angeles in 2030, what place occupies porn, how to manage the media and what are the critics.

In Medallions, players embrace the characters of the natives charged with exorcising the curse and seeking to recover the medallions to launch them into a giant furnace. The purpose is to transform them into pure metal ingots. But beware: not all members on the mission are well-intentioned...<br/><br/>In Medallions players have to collect medallions of 3 colors within the islands to transform them into gold ingots (VP's). In their turn players move their disc on the track up to 3 cases. Then, their pawn inside the board repeats the move selected. To continue the movement and go further a player may use cards from a common stack. At the beginning of the game each player receives a secret role (there may be a traitor or not in the team). If you are a good charater you will try to transform the highest number of medallions you can, trying to identify and accuse an eventual traitor (there are risks doing so). The traitor will have another goal: collect secretly the highest number of black medallions (traitor VP's). A traitor only can be accused until 3/4 of the game track.<br/><br/>The game has a simple but important economic gestion. To have money to buy new medallions arriving in a island, players will need to sell medallions and special ability cards that may be played in your turn.

Place ici au travail quotidien des policiers, &agrave; commencer par la sacro-sainte enqu&ecirc;te, vue du c&ocirc;te des patrouilleurs, des cops et des &quot;boeufs-carottes&quot; du SAD, et &agrave; quelques ajouts destin&eacute;s &agrave; personnaliser ces derniers : nouveaux stages, nouvelles r&egrave;gles, nouvelles armes, munitions et accessoires. Une fois n'est pas coutume, ce suppl&eacute;ment comprend plusieurs nouvelles, &agrave; travers lesquelles on pourra d&eacute;couvrir entre autres l'arriv&eacute;e d'une nouvelle cops, au double-visage semble t-il, et la plong&eacute;e de l'un de ses coll&egrave;gues en pleine extr&ecirc;me-droite.<br/><br/>Petite entorse &agrave; la tradition, puisque la section &quot;LAPD Blues&quot; se trouve pour une fois en t&ecirc;te de suppl&eacute;ment, et non plus dans les derni&egrave;res pages. Si en parcourant Saison 1-3 (Oct./Nov./Dec. 2030): Les Affranchis on avait pu d&eacute;couvrir le 35&egrave;me &eacute;tage &agrave; travers les yeux, ou plut&ocirc;t les oreilles d'une machine &agrave; caf&eacute;, c'est au tour cette fois-ci d'un animal fugitif vite chouchout&eacute; - mais comment a t-il bien pu arriver l&agrave; ?<br/><br/>Autre section ambiance avec &quot;Au jour le jour&quot;, la r&eacute;ponse d'un cops &agrave; une interview : sept pages pour balayer l'existence d'un flic comme tant d'autres, vie professionnelle, vie familiale, tentatives de corruptions et compromis au quotidien, symbolique de l'arme, soucis existentiels comme financiers, le tout sans paillettes. Qui a pr&eacute;tendu que la police de LA se r&eacute;sumait aux clich&eacute;s d'Hollywood ?<br/><br/>Le suppl&eacute;ment entame alors la retranscription d'un stage de formation : si dans [rpgite=131008] on avait pu &eacute;tudier les diverses m&eacute;thodes d'intervention gr&acirc;ce aux bons soins du SWAT, reste &agrave; apprendre comment mener une enqu&ecirc;te soign&eacute;e de A &agrave; Z, &agrave; partir du moment o&ugrave; une personne compose le 911 jusqu'&agrave; la remise du rapport final. Ce chapitre suit le sch&eacute;ma typique de l'enqu&ecirc;te :<br/><br/>     Appel du standard (avec au passage quelques d&eacute;tails sur les d&eacute;lais d'intervention, officiels et officieux) <br/>     Arriv&eacute;e des patrouilleurs sur les lieux et d&eacute;limitation de la sc&egrave;ne de crime. Quels sont alors les premiers gestes &agrave; adopter, essentiels pour la suite de l'enqu&ecirc;te<br/>     Arriv&eacute;e des d&eacute;tectives et techniciens de la police scientifique. Se pose alors parfois un probl&egrave;me de juridiction/comp&eacute;tence. Relev&eacute; des premiers indices, accompagn&eacute; de plusieurs conseils &agrave; ce sujet et accompagnement des victimes/criminels bless&eacute;s<br/>     Enqu&ecirc;te de proximit&eacute; et saisie des premiers t&eacute;moignages dans les meilleures conditions, &eacute;ventuellement formulation des mobiles &eacute;ventuels :<br/>     Poursuite de l'enqu&ecirc;te, d&eacute;clin&eacute;e sur plusieurs modes : fouilles et perquisitions, interrogatoires, planques et filatures, op&eacute;rations infiltr&eacute;es <br/>     Arrestation du ou des suspects, avec le probl&egrave;me des moyens &agrave; employer, des droits Miranda comme des mandats &agrave; demander aupr&egrave;s du parquet. Puis fin de la mission, le dossier est d&eacute;sormais du ressort de la justice.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>La section suivante propose quant &agrave; elle un retour sur la sc&egrave;ne de crime, au travers des nombreuses techniques offertes par la criminalistique de 2031. Une fois les c&eacute;l&egrave;bres bandes jaunes d&eacute;roul&eacute;es, on pourra alors s'int&eacute;resser au travail des TSC (Techniciens de Sc&egrave;nes de Crime) en mati&egrave;re d'empreintes digitales, g&eacute;n&eacute;tiques et autres, de balistique, d'&eacute;tude de documents, d'analyse de traces biologiques et non-biologiques, de traumatologie, de toxicologie et d'anthropologie - le tout accompagn&eacute; des mat&eacute;riels, technologies et astuces ad&eacute;quats. Cette section offre &eacute;galement un aper&ccedil;u des interrogatoires &quot;assist&eacute;s&quot; &agrave; l'aide d'un polygraphe ou thermographe, ainsi que du personnel des laboratoires et instituts m&eacute;dico-l&eacute;gaux publics et priv&eacute;s. Ce sera d'ailleurs l'occasion de d&eacute;couvrir un nouvel aspect du LAPD, la &quot;Scientific Investigation Division&quot;, employant des laborantins comme destechniciens de terrain.<br/><br/>Dans la foul&eacute;e de la criminalistique, 10-99 encha&icirc;ne avec la criminologie pass&eacute;e et moderne, dont la mission consiste &agrave; r&eacute;pondre au pourquoi d'un acte d&eacute;linquant. C'est ainsi que l'on d&eacute;couvrira les diff&eacute;rentes &eacute;coles de pens&eacute;es, leurs fondements et leur utilit&eacute;, ainsi que plusieurs paragraphes consacr&eacute;s aux criminologues les plus m&eacute;diatiques : les fameux profileurs, qu'ils travaillent pour l'Etat californien ou pour la sph&egrave;re priv&eacute;e, qu'il s'agisse de v&eacute;ritables professionnels ou de vulgaires charlatans. A titre de conclusion, l'arriv&eacute;e de Kristin Lane &agrave; la mairie de Los Angeles pose bien des soucis &agrave; la police, la politique de la nouvelle &eacute;lue en mati&egrave;re de vie priv&eacute;e et de r&eacute;insertion venant s'opposer &agrave; la constitution de fichiers et archives pourtant essentiels - t&ocirc;t ou tard, la justice devra trancher...<br/><br/>Par ailleurs, pour ce qui est de la justice, s'ouvre une section qui lui est enti&egrave;rement d&eacute;vou&eacute;e : le code p&eacute;nal californien (qui prolonge l'introduction &agrave; la proc&eacute;dure p&eacute;nale, incluse dans l'&eacute;cran de COPS). Tout d'abord, un explicatif quant &agrave; l'&eacute;lection des magistrats et sh&eacute;rifs, aux probl&egrave;mes pos&eacute;s par ce syst&egrave;me, &agrave; la hi&eacute;rarchie du syst&egrave;me judiciaire et &agrave; la proc&eacute;dure d'extradition. Vient ensuite la question cruciale de la preuve, &agrave; savoir quand est-ce qu'un policier est dans le l&eacute;gal ou l'ill&eacute;gal, quand l'obtention d'un mandat est obligatoire, quand peut-on consid&eacute;rer qu'il y a un flagrant d&eacute;lit, etc. Si les preuves sont retenues, reste &agrave; comprendre comment se d&eacute;roule un proc&egrave;s et une &eacute;ventuelle n&eacute;gociation entre parties, quelles peines sont appliqu&eacute;es (avec le cas des r&eacute;cidivistes et multir&eacute;cidivistes) et comment obtenir une lib&eacute;ration sur parole. S'en suit une liste des infractions les plus communes, accompagn&eacute;es chacune d'un niveau et r&eacute;parties entre les atteintes contre l'Etat, contre le d&eacute;partement de Justice, contre les personnes, contre la religion, la libert&eacute; de conscience et la morale publique, et en dernier lieu contre les biens. Pour d&eacute;terminer la peine (amende, TIG, incarc&eacute;ration, peine de mort), il suffira de se r&eacute;f&eacute;rer &agrave; un tableau r&eacute;capitulatif en croisant les colonnes &quot;niveau de l'infraction&quot; et &quot;gravit&eacute;/r&eacute;p&eacute;tition de l'infraction&quot;.<br/><br/>Retour au sein de la police dans la section suivante, avec une liste de nouveaux stages (arts martiaux, combat urbain, linguistique, partenariat, menottage, sports extr&ecirc;mes, plus des niveaux suppl&eacute;mentaires pour les stages d'interrogatoire et d'infiltration) ainsi que de nouvelles capacit&eacute;s sp&eacute;ciales, pour les stages de tir, de criminalistique, de protection des personnalit&eacute;s et commando. Et tir toujours, avec une section consacr&eacute;e aux armes &agrave; feu et &agrave; la balistique : lexique du m&eacute;canisme des armes, historique et statistiques, classification des diff&eacute;rentes armes, particularit&eacute;s des blessures par balles, plus une liste de munitions en tous genres allant de la balle en plastique &agrave; la c&eacute;l&egrave;bre &quot;tueuse de flics&quot;, et d'accessoires plus ou moins l&eacute;gaux, et pour terminer un &eacute;chantillon d'armes non l&eacute;tales employ&eacute;es par la police et l'arm&eacute;e : gaz, tasers, sons infra-basses, flashballs.<br/><br/>Tout ceci formait la premi&egrave;re moiti&eacute; du suppl&eacute;ment, la seconde est presque enti&egrave;rement consacr&eacute;e aux &quot;Affaires en cours&quot; du LAPD, c'est-&agrave;-dire :<br/><br/>     Cinq enqu&ecirc;tes au format 10-18, trois tournant autour de la police et de ses brebis galeuses, une quatri&egrave;me &agrave; l'ambiance plus l&eacute;g&egrave;re, une cinqui&egrave;me mettant en sc&egrave;ne une personnalit&eacute; appel&eacute;e &agrave; prendre de l'importance, crois&eacute;e parmi les tueurs en s&eacute;rie de Saison 1-6 (Mai/Juin 2031): Helter Skelter.<br/>     &quot;Jours tranquilles &agrave; Susanville&quot; : un sc&eacute;nario au cours duquel les cops pourront savourer quelques vacances bien m&eacute;rit&eacute;es en Californie du Nord, loin du smog et des gangers de Los Angeles. D&eacute;couvrant une sympathique bourgade campagnarde, reste &agrave; savoir si les cops pourront profiter durablement du paysage et de la douceur locale...<br/>     &quot;Jackpot !&quot; : enqu&ecirc;te discr&egrave;te &agrave; Las Vegas lors du salon nord-am&eacute;ricain du &quot;Gun Show&quot;, sur fond de meurtre crapuleux. Quand un cadre de Sentry Corp finit en charpie au beau milieu d'un mass-murder, on peut &ecirc;tre s&ucirc;r que son employeur fera bien des vagues pour r&eacute;soudre cette anicroche.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Il ne reste plus qu'&agrave; finir avec trois annexes :<br/><br/>     Les dossiers du SAD, qui permettront d'en savoir plus sur la personnalit&eacute; du redoutable capitaine Bronstein et de ses lieutenants, sur les m&eacute;thodes de recrutement de la division, sur ses taupes et d&eacute;tectives. Ce sera &eacute;galement l'occasion de comprendre les missions du SAD, en th&eacute;orie comme en pratique, de m&ecirc;me que l'esprit, la psychologie et les techniques qui animent l'unit&eacute; de ceux pour lesquels &quot;hors des proc&eacute;dures, point de r&eacute;pit&quot;. Derni&egrave;res pr&eacute;cisions avec les actuels chevaux de bataille du SAD et le conflit latent avec la mairie de LA, qui menace d'exploser t&ocirc;t ou tard au grand jour...<br/>     De nouvelles r&egrave;gles et quelques points de pr&eacute;cision, en mati&egrave;re de combat (tir et corps &agrave; corps), d'initiative, de poursuite, d'interrogatoire ou encore d'encaissement.<br/>     Et enfin un syst&egrave;me de cr&eacute;ation rapide de PNJ, suivant cinq niveaux allant de novice &agrave; v&eacute;t&eacute;ran, dot&eacute;s de caract&eacute;ristiques et comp&eacute;tences mais avec &eacute;galement de diff&eacute;rents &quot;styles&quot;, des particularit&eacute;s et talents divers, qu'il s'agisse de tirer avec deux armes &agrave; la fois ou de passer totalement inaper&ccedil;u, pour donner vie &agrave; ces personnages, simples anonymes, hommes de main, alli&eacute;s ou &quot;boss de fin de niveau&quot;.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Translation courtesy of Google:<br/><br/>10-99: a figure apparently cryptic, yet does that refer to the LAPD radio code for &quot;emergency call to all units,&quot; which opens the second season of COPS. Place here the daily work of police officers, starting with the sacrosanct survey for the coast patrol cops and &quot;horse carrots&quot; of SAD, and some additions for customizing these: new courses, new rules , new weapons, ammunition and accessories. Once is not custom, this supplement includes several new, through which we can find among others the arrival of a new cop, the double-face, it seems, and diving from one of his colleagues extreme right in the middle.<br/><br/>Little twist to tradition, since the &quot;LAPD Blues&quot; is for once ahead of supplement, and not in the last pages. If traveling in Goodfellas had discovered the 35th floor through the eyes, or rather ears of a coffee machine, it's time this time a fugitive animal quickly spoiled - but how does a it could have happened here?<br/><br/>Another section ambiance with &quot;Day by Day&quot;, the response of a cop in an interview: seven pages to scan the existence of a cop like so many others, professional life, family life, attempted corruption and compromise daily, symbolic of the weapon, as financial worries existential, all without glitter. Who claimed that the LAPD boiled clich&eacute;s of Hollywood?<br/><br/>The supplement then begins the transcription of a training course, if in Hitek Lotek we could study the various methods of intervention with the care of SWAT is to learn how to conduct a careful A to Z, from when a person dials 911 to the final report. This chapter follows the typical pattern of the survey: <br/><br/>     Call of the standard (with passing some details on the response time, official and unofficial) <br/>     Arrival patrol the site and delimitation of the crime scene. What then are the first steps to adopt essential for further investigation <br/>     Arrival of detectives and forensic technicians. Sometimes arises a problem of jurisdiction / competence. Statement of the first clues, along with several tips about it and support victims / injured criminals <br/>     Investigation of proximity and capturing the first evidence in the best conditions possible formulation of any mobile: <br/>     Continuation of the survey, available in several modes : searches, interrogations, hideouts and stalking, infiltrating operations <br/>     Arrest of the suspect with the problem of how to use, like Miranda rights mandates request from prosecutors. Then at the end of the mission, the folder is now the responsibility of the justice.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The following section provides for its return to the crime scene, through the many techniques offered by forensics 2031. Once the famous yellow stripes place, we can then focus the work of TSC (Scenes of Crime Technicians) regarding fingerprinting, genetic and other ballistics, study documents, trace analysis biological and non-biological, trauma, toxicology and anthropology - all with materials, technologies, and tips suitable. This section provides an overview of the interrogation &quot;assisted&quot; with a polygraph or thermograph and laboratory personnel and forensic institutes public and private. This is also an opportunity to discover a new aspect of the LAPD, the &quot;Scientific Investigation Division&quot;, employing laboratory as destechniciens field.<br/><br/>In the wake of forensics, 10-99 connects with past and modern criminology, whose mission is to respond to why a delinquent act. Thus we discover the different schools of thought, their foundations and their usefulness as well as several paragraphs on the most criminologists media: the famous profilers, they work for the State of California or the private sphere , whether true professionals or vulgar charlatans. As a conclusion, the arrival of Kristin Lane for Mayor of Los Angeles raises many concerns to the police, the newly elected policy regarding privacy and reintegration coming oppose the creation of files and archives yet essential - sooner or later justice will decide ...<br/><br/>Moreover, with regard to justice, opens a section that is entirely dedicated: the California Penal Code (which extends the introduction to criminal procedure, included in the display COPS). First of all, explanatory notes on the election of judges and sheriffs, the problems posed by that system, the hierarchy of the judiciary and the extradition proceedings. Then comes the crucial question of evidence, know when a police officer is in the legal or illegal, when a warrant is required, when can we consider that there is a glaring crime, etc.. If the evidence is accepted, is to understand what happens during a trial and possible negotiation between the parties, which penalties are applied (with repeat offenders and offenders) and how to get parole. What follows is a list of the most common offenses, each accompanied by a level and distributed among offenses against the State, against the Department of Justice, against people, against religion, freedom of conscience and morals and lastly against property. To determine the penalty (fine, community service, incarceration, death penalty), it suffices to refer to a summary table columns crossing the &quot;offense level&quot; and &quot;Gravity / repetition of the offense.&quot;<br/><br/>Back in the police in the next section with a list of new courses (martial arts, urban combat, linguistic, partnership, handcuffing, extreme sports, plus additional levels for internships interrogation and infiltration) and new special abilities for training shooting, forensics, VIP protection and commando. And still shooting, with a section dedicated to firearms and ballistics: the mechanism lexicon weapons, historical and statistical classification of different weapons, special gunshot wounds, plus a list of all kinds of ammunition from the ball plastic to the famous &quot;killer cops&quot;, and accessories more or less legal, and finally a sample of non-lethal weapons used by the police and the army gas, tasers, sounds sub-bass, plastic bullets.<br/><br/>All this formed the first half of the charge, the second is almost entirely devoted to &quot;current affairs&quot; of the LAPD, that is to say: <br/><br/>     Five investigations size 10-18, three revolving around the police and their black sheep, a fourth in the mood lighter, a fifth featuring a character called to grow in importance, cross among serial killers Helter Skelter . <br/>     &quot;Quiet Days in Susanville&quot; a scenario in which the cops can enjoy some well-deserved vacation in Northern California, away from the smog and gangers Los Angeles. Discovering a friendly village countryside, the question remains whether the cops can enjoy sustainable landscape and the local softness ... <br/>     &quot;Jackpot!&quot; : Covert investigation in Las Vegas at the show's North American &quot;Gun Show&quot; on the bottom of brutal murder. When a frame ends in Sentry Corp. lint in the middle of a mass murder, you can be sure that his employer will many waves to solve this glitch.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>It remains only to finish with three appendices: <br/><br/>     Records of SAD, which will learn more about the personality of the fearsome Captain Bronstein and his lieutenants, methods of recruitment division, its moles and detectives. This will also be the opportunity to understand the missions of SAD, in theory and in practice, as well as the mind, psychology and techniques that drive unit for which &quot;off procedures, no respite.&quot; Last details with the current workhorses of the SAD and the latent conflict with the city of LA, which threatens to explode sooner or later the big day ... <br/>     New rules and some points accurately in combat (shooting and melee) initiative, prosecution, interrogation or collection. <br/>     And finally a quick NPC creation, according to five levels ranging from novice to veteran, with characteristics and skills but also different &quot;styles&quot;, particularities and various talents, whether to fire two weapons at once or go unnoticed, to give life to these characters, simple anonymous henchmen, allies or &quot;boss End of level. &quot;<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "131016": {"rpgartist": ["Dover Pictorial Archive Series", "Scott Harshbarger"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version", "Softcover book"], "poll": [], "name": "Lords of Olympus", "rpghonor": ["2012 Indie RPG Award - Best Production - Runner-Up", "2012 Indie RPG Award - Best Support - Runner-Up", "2012 Indie RPG Award - Game of the Year - Runner-Up"], "rpgproducer": ["Brett M.

Bienvenue dans les coulisses de la culture, du journalisme, du sport et du divertissement de 2031, une petite page de pub et on continue.<br/><br/>Les premi&egrave;res pages de 15 Minutes s'ouvrent sur la rubrique &quot;LAPD Blues&quot;, o&ugrave; on pourra retrouver la d&eacute;tective Anita &quot;Proc'&quot; Garcia, gri&egrave;vement bless&eacute;e &agrave; la suite d'Saison 1-6 (Mai/Juin 2031): Helter Skelter. Si la polici&egrave;re est gracieusement soign&eacute;e par les m&eacute;decins et techniciens de la respectable entreprise pharmaceutique CaSaPha et d&eacute;sormais pr&ecirc;te &agrave; reprendre du service, on ne pourra que s'&eacute;tonner d'un tel attrait soudain de CaSaPha pour les repr&eacute;sentants des forces de l'ordre. Pour terminer, la revue de presse internationale (avec notamment la situation politique des continents africain et europ&eacute;en, ainsi que les tristes nouvelles du front colombien) et les potins corrosifs de l'Indiscret, avec la politique de Madame le Maire en ligne de mire.<br/>Pour ce qui du reste du suppl&eacute;ment, 15 Minutes suit le sch&eacute;ma instaur&eacute; depuis la deuxi&egrave;me saison : un chapitre &quot;Les dossiers du LAPD&quot;, accessibles &agrave; tous, &quot;Affaires en cours&quot;, enqu&ecirc;tes 10-18 et sc&eacute;narios et enfin &quot;Les dossiers du SAD&quot;, strictement r&eacute;serv&eacute;s au MJ. En revanche, comme pour toute la gamme, on retrouvera au fil du suppl&eacute;ment diff&eacute;rents encarts apportant des pr&eacute;cisions ainsi que plusieurs nouvelles d'ambiance, d&eacute;peignant l'&eacute;volution des personnages de COPS.<br/><br/>Premier chapitre : le journalisme, le sport et la culture de 2031, mais &eacute;galement l'&eacute;tat d'esprit type des vingt millions d'Angelinos. Pour commencer, honneur aux journalistes : on apprendra quels fichiers d&eacute;tient la police &agrave; leur sujet et quelles sont les dispositions judiciaires relatives &agrave; la libert&eacute; de presse, mais &eacute;galement quelles sont les motivations, m&eacute;thodes de travail et associations des journalistes. A cela, il faudra ajouter une analyse des diff&eacute;rents m&eacute;dias, un code d&eacute;ontologique, un bref lexique du jargon ; le tout avant d'aborder le &quot;m&eacute;tier&quot; : comment mener un reportage d'un bout &agrave; l'autre, quelles sont les r&egrave;gles d'or du journalisme, quelles relations nouer. Viennent enfin trois grands noms du milieu dont Julia Andreotti, d&eacute;j&agrave; crois&eacute;e &agrave; plusieurs reprises lors des suppl&eacute;ments pr&eacute;c&eacute;dents et des pr&eacute;cisions sur les journalistes en tant qu'alli&eacute;s ou informateurs des PJ. A noter, l'apparition d'une nouvelle comp&eacute;tence, &quot;Reportage&quot;, et des pr&eacute;cisions sur les jets et difficult&eacute;s pour la recherche d'indices en tant que journaliste.<br/><br/>La suite est &eacute;galement d&eacute;di&eacute;e au journalisme, mais sous un angle bien moins reluisant : une grande partie du &quot;Quatri&egrave;me pouvoir&quot; a vendu ses id&eacute;aux (si ce n'est son &acirc;me) de longue date ; cette section s'int&eacute;resse aux m&eacute;thodes de censure et aux pressions qui s'exercent sur la profession : &eacute;tat des lieux, suivi d'un cas d'&eacute;cole qui d&eacute;peint la mise &agrave; mort progressive d'un reportage dont le seul tort est de s'int&eacute;resser de trop pr&egrave;s &agrave; la v&eacute;rit&eacute; &agrave; l'encontre d'un trop gros gibier. Cependant, tout n'est pas perdu, pour peu que journalistes et policiers parviennent &agrave; s'accorder pour faire avancer et m&eacute;diatiser un dossier sulfureux. Au tour du petit &eacute;cran et des derni&egrave;res r&eacute;volutions t&eacute;l&eacute;visuelles : la 3D, les syst&egrave;mes d'immersion et les &eacute;crans ultra-plats sont d&eacute;sormais du domaine du banal pour les citoyens moyens, mais arrive aujourd'hui le proc&eacute;d&eacute; &quot;Larger than Life&quot; con&ccedil;u par les R&eacute;alistes - laissez les acteurs et pr&eacute;sentateurs sortir de l'&eacute;cran et s'installer chez vous ! Cependant, le monde de la t&eacute;l&eacute;vision c'est &eacute;galement l'opposition entre programmes en direct et t&eacute;l&eacute;chargeables, des &eacute;missions tellement &quot;crazy crazy&quot; ainsi que des pr&eacute;sentateurs pr&ecirc;ts &agrave; faire des pieds et des mains pour agglutiner le t&eacute;l&eacute;spectateur &agrave; l'&eacute;cran, depuis Barnie l'adorable panda savant jusqu'&agrave; Tex Casanova, &agrave; l'antenne 24h/24. Quant aux cha&icirc;nes, l'expression &quot;l'embarras du choix&quot; semble bien faible, de m&ecirc;me que &quot;bon go&ucirc;t&quot; devant la grille de programmes de Canalanal 12. Et ce n'est pas XXXLive ou la t&eacute;l&eacute;-r&eacute;alit&eacute; de NTV6 qui viendront remonter le niveau.<br/><br/>Viennent les dessous du sport : les habitudes ont plus que chang&eacute; en trois d&eacute;cennies, avec la perte de vitesse des sports ext&eacute;rieurs et amateurs (au profit des holo-coachs d'int&eacute;rieur et du sport en solitaire), la l&eacute;galisation internationale du dopage et les nouvelles habitudes impos&eacute;es par la technologie et le Network. De m&ecirc;me, le probl&egrave;me du sport pour ob&egrave;ses (avec notamment un remake payant de &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; : perte de poids garantie avec l'entra&icirc;nement des Marines !) et le devenir des tenues et &eacute;quipements sportifs - haute couture, sportswear, m&ecirc;me combat ! Pour conclure : le milieu sportif professionnel, qui a d&eacute;cid&eacute; de tirer un trait sur l'hypocrisie du dopage en l'autorisant, sous strict contr&ocirc;le scientifique. Mais d'autres changements demeurent, depuis le d&eacute;veloppement des sports virtuels jusqu'&agrave; l'introduction de la religion, du mysticisme et des x&eacute;no-greffes animales dans le milieu. Un dernier mot sur les revers de la m&eacute;daille : le sport reste gangren&eacute; par la triche et les paris ill&eacute;gaux, parall&egrave;les au syst&egrave;me de bornes l&eacute;gales, au nom d'une poign&eacute;e de dollars.<br/><br/>Suite aux affres du corps, celles de l'esprit avec l'art angelino, aussi vaste, d&eacute;lirant et exub&eacute;rant que la Cit&eacute; des Anges. A c&ocirc;t&eacute; des disciplines artistiques traditionnelles, des nouveaut&eacute;s avant-gardistes font fureur telles que l'art biologique (si tant est que le croisement d'un lapin et d'une m&eacute;duse soit de l'art), le body art (la mutilation, la scarification et le remodelage des corps), la &quot;plastinisation&quot; des cadavres et l'Urb'Art des jeunes gangers. En parall&egrave;le, les derni&egrave;res tendances musicales depuis l'&eacute;ni&egrave;me bouillie pop jusqu'aux nouvelles symphonies de Wagner et Mozart compos&eacute;es par IA, les stars montantes des diff&eacute;rents milieux, les grands noms et les requins de la production, les monuments et festivals du cin&eacute;ma, ainsi que les derni&egrave;res surprises du milieu de la mode.<br/><br/>En guise de conclusion, une section d'une dizaine de pages baptis&eacute;e &quot;Californian Way of Life&quot;, &agrave; vocation plus sociologique. Ainsi, quelle est l'attitude du Californien moyen en mati&egrave;re de loisirs r&eacute;els et virtuels, de sport, de jeux et tout simplement de socialisation ? Que faire de son enfant apr&egrave;s les cours et que faire soi-m&ecirc;me apr&egrave;s le travail, dans une ville o&ugrave; la rue est consid&eacute;r&eacute;e comme une jungle ? Et fragment&eacute;e comme l'est Los Angeles, difficile de passer &agrave; c&ocirc;t&eacute; du probl&egrave;me du communautarisme, du repli des cultures, du d&eacute;veloppement de sous-cultures et contre-cultures, sans oublier les modes de manifestations physiques et informatiques, autant de donn&eacute;es essentielles pour la police, si elle entend garder le contr&ocirc;le de la ville et le contact avec ses habitants. Dernier &eacute;l&eacute;ment : un calendrier complet des f&ecirc;tes et &eacute;v&egrave;nements religieux, spirituels et la&iuml;cs, de Septembre 2031 &agrave; Septembre 2032 ; un &eacute;l&eacute;ment essentiel dans un univers o&ugrave; ne pas avoir de convictions (peu importe lesquelles) revient &agrave; ne pas exister.<br/><br/>Deuxi&egrave;me chapitre : les affaires en cours, qui d&eacute;butent par cinq enqu&ecirc;tes 10-18 m&ecirc;lant p&eacute;dophilie, guerre des gangs sur un campus, conflit conjugal chaotique, mur du silence &agrave; South Central et prise d'otages tendue avant de poursuivre avec trois sc&eacute;narios plus consistants.<br/><br/>     &quot;Apr&egrave;s la pluie&quot; : plong&eacute;e dans le milieu des fils du soleil levant, apr&egrave;s l'assassinat spectaculaire d'un chef de clan yakusa. Une fois les morts enterr&eacute;s, mafieux et cops vont mener l'enqu&ecirc;te chacun de leur c&ocirc;t&eacute; avec un doigt&eacute; &ocirc; combien diff&eacute;rent, tandis que le paisible quartier de Little Tokyo menace de sombrer en pleine guerre des clans.<br/>     &quot;Il court, il court le Furet !&quot; : &agrave; la poursuite d'un t&eacute;moin essentiel, dans une affaire o&ugrave; la Mairie de LA est embourb&eacute;e, les cops vont devoir jouer contre la montre pour rattraper ce fugitif sur lequel p&egrave;se un contrat de plusieurs millions de dollars. Une somme rondelette qui va aiguiser bien des app&eacute;tits et compliquer la t&acirc;che des PJ, qui risquent &eacute;galement d'avoir leurs propres coll&egrave;gues aux trousses. Et pendant ce temps, l'heure tourne !<br/>     &quot;Condamn&eacute;e&quot; : direction les prestigieux studios et usines &agrave; r&ecirc;ve de Burbank, en pleine s&eacute;quence de tournage de film, o&ugrave; les cops seront charg&eacute;s de la protection rapproch&eacute;e d'un acteur sur le retour, menac&eacute; de mort. Au passage, se laisseront-ils tenter par un petit essai devant les cam&eacute;ras ? Qui mieux que d'h&eacute;ro&iuml;ques cops peuvent incarner des flics sur pellicule ?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Restent les dossiers du SAD, pr&egrave;s d'une vingtaine de pages qui reprennent le contenu principal des dossiers du LAPD pr&eacute;c&eacute;dents et d&eacute;voilent plusieurs secrets f&acirc;cheux. En premier lieu, plusieurs scandales potentiels, certains anodins, d'autres autrement plus graves, aux cons&eacute;quences tant&ocirc;t cocasses (transformer les PJ en h&eacute;ros de la t&eacute;l&eacute;-r&eacute;alit&eacute; polici&egrave;re) tant&ocirc;t g&ecirc;nantes si ce n'est dangereuses (comme se frotter &agrave; une corporation majeure). Puis viennent des pr&eacute;cisions sur les trois journalistes vedettes pr&eacute;sent&eacute;s dans le premier chapitre, avec leurs caract&eacute;ristiques, comp&eacute;tences et connaissances au grand complet, mais &eacute;galement leur face cach&eacute;e, leurs cachotteries et leurs travers personnels comme professionnels. Dans la lign&eacute;e des scandales, on pourra trouver de m&ecirc;me trois scoops : trois situations particuli&egrave;rement embarrassantes, avec leurs tenants et leurs aboutissants, qui pourront alimenter ou constituer autant de 10-18 et sc&eacute;narios. Homophobie, exp&eacute;rimentations douteuses, nouvelle affaire Rodney King - et potentiellement nouvelles &eacute;meutes sanglantes de 1992 - sont au programme, pour peu que les PJ viennent mettre leur grain de sel dans l'histoire. Enfin, plusieurs r&eacute;v&eacute;lations sur les derni&egrave;res avanc&eacute;es technologiques t&eacute;l&eacute;visuelles, sur certains pr&eacute;sentateurs et &eacute;missions, sur les milieux sportifs et les syst&egrave;mes de paris, et pour terminer sur la communaut&eacute; artistique de la Cit&eacute; des Anges. Difficile d'imaginer tout ce que l'on peut faire ou subir au service de l'art et des spectateurs - mais le star system ne peut-il exiger un l&eacute;ger sacrifice ?<br/><br/>A noter, &ccedil;a et l&agrave;, quelques encarts &quot;News&quot;, qui s'int&eacute;ressent de pr&egrave;s &agrave; plusieurs personnages de LA : des t&ecirc;tes tombent au propre comme au figur&eacute;, au sein de la police comme des diverses mafias ; des enqu&ecirc;tes de longue haleine avancent peu &agrave; peu ; de curieuses alliances se nouent dans les coulisses du pouvoir ; des remous agitent les couloirs du SAD : en somme, l'univers &eacute;volue.<br/><br/>Mais &agrave; pr&eacute;sent, cam&eacute;ra zoom arri&egrave;re, fondu au noir, et g&eacute;n&eacute;rique !<br/><br/><br/>Translation courtesy of Google:<br/><br/>Los Angeles, the film and television: a m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois of the most persistent and successful love story that asks only to survive, while the citizen California lambda is watered every second images, information, sports, stories, games, series, all constantly hesitating between inept and serious - or even inept at all, must be seen. Welcome to the backstage of culture, journalism, sports and entertainment of 2031, a small pub page and continue.<br/><br/>The first pages of 15 Minutes open on the &quot;LAPD Blues,&quot; where we can find the detective Anita &quot;Proc&quot; Garcia was seriously injured as a result of Helter Skelter . If the police is kindly treated by doctors and technicians CaSaPha respectable pharmaceutical company and now ready to resume the service, we can only wonder such a sudden appeal CaSaPha for representatives of law enforcement. Finally, the international press (including the political situation in Africa and Europe, as well as the sad news from the front Colombia) and the corrosive gossip Indiscreet with the policy of the Mayor in sight.<br/><br/>Regarding the rest of the supplement, 15 Minutes follows the pattern established since the second season: a chapter &quot;The LAPD records&quot; accessible, &quot;Current Cases&quot;, surveys and scenarios 10-18 and finally &quot;The records SAD, &quot;strictly reserved for MJ. However, as for the whole range, we find over different inserts additional clarifying and several new mood, portraying the character development of PSC.<br/><br/>First chapter journalism, sport and culture from 2031, but also the type of mindset twenty million Angelinos. To begin with, to honor journalists: we learn what the police files held about them and what are the legal provisions relating to freedom of the press, but also what are the motivations, methods of work and associations of journalists. To this must be added an analysis of different media, a code of ethics, a brief glossary of jargon, all before addressing the &quot;job&quot;: how to conduct a report from one end to the other, what are the rules Gold journalism, what relationships develop. Then come three middle names including Julia Andreotti, already met several times in previous supplements and details of journalists as allies or informants PJ. Note the appearance of a new skill, &quot;Reportage&quot;, and details of the projects and challenges for clues as a journalist.<br/><br/>The suite is also dedicated to journalism, but at an angle less encouraging: a large part of the &quot;Fourth Estate&quot; has sold his ideals (if not his soul) long, this section focuses on the methods of censorship and pressures on the profession: status, followed by a case study that depicts the killing of a progressive story whose only crime is to pry the truth against a too big game. However, all is not lost, as long as journalists and police manage to agree to advance and publicize a folder sulfur. At the turn of the last small screen and television revolutions: the 3D immersion systems and ultra-flat screens are now the domain of the ordinary for the average citizen, but now comes the process &quot;Larger than Life&quot; designed by the Realists - let the actors and presenters out of the screen and move in with you! However, the world of television is also the opposition between live programs and downloadable programs so &quot;crazy crazy&quot; and presenters willing to make hands and feet to agglutinate the viewer to the screen, since Barnie the adorable panda scientist to Tex Casanova, the antenna 24h/24. As for the chains, the term &quot;spoiled for choice&quot; seems weak, as &quot;good taste&quot; to the program schedule Canalanal 12. And it is not XXXLive or reality TV NTV6 that will raise the level.<br/><br/>Come under the sport habits have changed in more than three decades, with the loss of speed and outdoor sports enthusiasts (in favor of holo-coaches and sport interior alone), legalization of doping and the international new habits imposed by technology and the Network. Similarly, the issue of sport for overweight (including a remake of paying &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; guaranteed weight loss training with Marines!) And the future of sports clothing and equipment - haute couture, sportswear, same fight ! To conclude: the sports professional, who has decided to draw a line on the hypocrisy of doping authorizing, under strict scientific control. But other changes remain, since the development of virtual sports until the introduction of religion, mysticism and xeno-transplantation animal in the middle. A final word on the other side of the coin: the sport is riddled with cheating and illegal paris parallel legal system terminals, on behalf of a handful of dollars.<br/><br/>Following the horrors of the body, those of the mind with art angelino, vast, wild and exuberant as the City of Angels. Besides the traditional artistic disciplines, news rage avant-garde art such as organic (if that is the intersection of a rabbit and a jellyfish or art), body art (mutilation, scarring and remodeling of the body), &quot;plastinisation&quot; corpses and young Urb'Art gangers. In parallel, the latest musical trends since the umpteenth boiled until new pop symphonies composed by Mozart and Wagner IA, rising stars of different backgrounds, big names and sharks production, film festivals and monuments, and the latest surprises in the fashion.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a section of ten pages called &quot;Californian Way of Life&quot;, with a more sociological. So, what is the attitude of the average Californian in leisure real and virtual sports, games and simply socializing? What to do with her child after school and do it yourself after work, in a city where the street is considered a jungle? And fragmented as Los Angeles is difficult to miss the problem of communalism, the decline of crops, development of sub-cultures and cons-cultures, not to mention the physical manifestations and modes of computer data as essential to the police if it intends to keep control of the city and its people contact. Last element: a full calendar of festivals and events religious, spiritual and secular, from September 2031 to September 2032, an essential element in a world where not having beliefs (no matter which) amounts to not exist.<br/><br/>Second chapter pending cases, which begin with five surveys mixing 10-18 pedophilia, gang warfare on campus, marital conflict chaotic wall of silence in South Central and tense hostage before continuing with three scenarios more consistent . <br/><br/>     &quot;After the Rain&quot; dive into the middle son of the rising sun, after the assassination of a head of spectacular yakuza clan. Once buried the dead, mafia cops will investigate each in turn with a different fingering oh, while the quiet neighborhood of Little Tokyo threatens to sink during the war of clans. <br/>     &quot;He runs, he runs the ferret! &quot; : In pursuit of a key witness in a case where the City of LA is stuck, the cops will have to play against the clock to catch the fugitive on which weighs a contract worth several million dollars. A tidy sum that will whet appetites well and complicate the task of PJ, which may also have their own colleagues in the kits. And during this time, the clock is ticking! <br/>     &quot;Sentenced&quot; management major studios and factories dream Burbank, full sequence filming, where cops will be responsible for close protection of a player on the back threatened with death. Incidentally, they let themselves be tempted by a small test before the cameras? Who better than heroic cops cops can embody on film?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Records are SAD, nearly twenty pages which incorporate the main content of the records of previous LAPD and reveal more secrets unfortunate. First, several potential scandals, some trivial, others far more serious consequences sometimes funny (turning PJ hero of the reality police) sometimes annoying if not dangerous (such as rubbing a corporation majeure). Then there are details on the three leading journalists presented in the first chapter, with their characteristics, skills and knowledge in full force, but also their dark side, their secrets and their staff through as professionals. In line with scandals, one can find even three scoops: three particularly embarrassing situations with their supporters and outs, which can be as much power or 10-18 and scenarios. Homophobia, dubious experiments, new Rodney King - new and potentially bloody riots of 1992 - is the program, as long as the characters come to put their two cents in history. Finally, several revelations about the latest technology television on some presenters and programs on the sports paris and systems and to complete the artistic community in the City of Angels. Difficult to imagine what we can do or suffer in the service of art and spectators - but the star system it can require a little sacrifice?<br/><br/>A note here and there, a few inserts &quot;News&quot;, pay close attention to several characters from LA: heads fall to literally and figuratively, in the police as various mafias, the long-term investigations suggest little by little curious alliances are formed in the corridors of power, stir stir the corridors of SAD: in short, the universe evolves.<br/><br/>But now, camera zoom, fade to black, and generic!<br/><br/>"}, "131021": {"rpgdesigner": ["Beno\u00eet Attinost", "Jeff Beney", "Nicolas Benoist", "Charlotte Bousquet", "Thomas Cheilan", "Antoine Clermond", "Croc", "Arnaud Cuidet", "Sandy Julien", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Larr\u00e9", "Olivier No\u00ebl", "Geoffrey Picard", "Olivier Roullier", "Marc Sautriot"], "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover version"], "poll": [], "name": "4 Juillet", "rpgartist": ["Bernard Bittler", "Aleksi Briclot", "Franck Poterlot", "Christophe Swal"], "rpgproducer": ["Anne-Ga\u00eblle Argy", "Yann Arndt", "Aleksi Briclot", "Greg Cervall", "Thorfin McBoulan", "Geoffrey Picard", "Alicia Simonnet"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1425845.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Crime (Criminal / Law Enforcement)", "Modern (Near Future)", "Science Fiction (Cyberpunk)"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["C.O.P.S."], "rpgpublisher": ["Siroz Productions"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["C.O.P.S.

Ce suppl&eacute;ment l&egrave;ve ainsi le voile sur les coulisses de la s&eacute;cession, sur la politique californienne locale, f&eacute;d&eacute;rale et internationale, sur les principaux partis et lobbies, ainsi que sur la mairie de Los Angeles.<br/><br/>Comme &agrave; l'accoutum&eacute;e, le suppl&eacute;ment comprend une section LAPD blues, donnant le pouls de l'unit&eacute; COPS jour apr&egrave;s jour. Ainsi, l'enqu&ecirc;te sur le meurtre du d&eacute;tective Cortez progresse tandis que se croisent v&eacute;t&eacute;rans et nouvelles figures du COPS, &eacute;voquant tour &agrave; tour le retour de &quot;Proc&quot;, le passage &agrave; tabac de Brad Simpson, les malheurs de &quot;Pas de Bol&quot; Webster et la remise en marche de la machine &agrave; caf&eacute;.<br/><br/>Le suppl&eacute;ment encha&icirc;ne alors avec le premier chapitre, les Dossiers du LAPD. Pour commencer, un retour sur la d&eacute;claration d'ind&eacute;pendance de la Californie, au travers de l'interview d'un &quot;porteur de valises&quot; sans complaisance - autant dire un regard bien &eacute;loign&eacute; des manuels d'histoire officiels, qui pose bon nombre de questions quant aux moyens mis en oeuvre lors de la s&eacute;cession et aux acteurs majeurs de l'&eacute;poque. Au final, qui manipule qui, de l'Union, de la Californie et de telle personne ou consortium ? Retour en arri&egrave;re, sur vingt ann&eacute;es de politique de l'ombre. A signaler &ccedil;&agrave; et l&agrave; plusieurs encarts, consacr&eacute;s aux lobbies (qu'ils soient politiques, financiers, &eacute;cologistes, technologiques ou id&eacute;ologiques - et plus ou moins dangereux) ainsi qu'aux derni&egrave;res nouvelles polici&egrave;res et judiciaires du tout Los Angeles.<br/><br/>Puis il est temps d'obtenir une vision plus neutre de la R&eacute;publique, avec une &eacute;tude de ses composantes, de son organisation et de ses institutions. En d&eacute;pit de son nom, que certains proposent d'ailleurs de modifier, la R&eacute;publique de Californie ne se limite pas au seul Golden State, mais comprend &eacute;galement Hawa&iuml; et le Nevada : trois &eacute;tats formant une f&eacute;d&eacute;ration sur le mod&egrave;le des anciens USA.<br/><br/>Premi&egrave;re &eacute;tape : l'&eacute;tat f&eacute;d&eacute;ral, avec sa constitution, ses instances l&eacute;gislatives et ex&eacute;cutives, son syst&egrave;me judiciaire et ses agences f&eacute;d&eacute;rales (polici&egrave;res ou non). Ce sera &eacute;galement l'occasion de d&eacute;couvrir Sacramento, capitale tant de la R&eacute;publique que de l'&eacute;tat de Californie - un cumul parfois indigeste, au point que certains envisagent un transfert de pouvoir &agrave; Los Angeles. Mais les taux de criminalit&eacute; records de la ville plaident jusque-l&agrave; en sa d&eacute;faveur... Autre pomme de discorde : la repr&eacute;sentativit&eacute; d'Hawa&iuml; et du Nevada au Congr&egrave;s face &agrave; la toute-puissante Californie - que peuvent les huit repr&eacute;sentants des deux &eacute;tats face aux cinquante-cinq repr&eacute;sentants californiens ?<br/><br/>Deuxi&egrave;me &eacute;tape : l'&eacute;tat de Californie, avec &agrave; son tour sa constitution et ses diff&eacute;rentes institutions nationales.<br/>Troisi&egrave;me &eacute;tape, &quot;l'Ours &agrave; trois t&ecirc;tes&quot;, alias le chevauchement souvent complexe des pouvoirs f&eacute;d&eacute;raux, nationaux et locaux. Les cops sont ici directement concern&eacute;s, puisque cette superposition les fera croiser t&ocirc;t ou tard les agents du sh&eacute;rif de tel comt&eacute;, de la police de telle municipalit&eacute;, de la California Highway Patrol, de l'arm&eacute;e et des agences f&eacute;d&eacute;rales. Dans ce cas, qui est comp&eacute;tent et qui peut faire pression sur l'autre ? D'autres questions surgissent, telles que le mode de scrutin, le planning des futures &eacute;lections, la corruption en 2032 et le jargon politique.<br/><br/>La suite est d&eacute;volue aux grands partis californiens, que les MJ et PJ auront peut-&ecirc;tre d&eacute;j&agrave; d&eacute;couverts lors des &eacute;lections municipales de fin 2030. Six grands mouvements nationaux se taillent la part du lion, avec respectivement :<br/><br/>     Les D&eacute;mocrates Visionnaires, qui comptent parmi leurs rangs certains des acteurs les plus populaires de l'ind&eacute;pendance. Mais leur &eacute;viction de la mairie de Los Angeles et les accusations de mollesse et de d&eacute;magogie laissent craindre un d&eacute;clin du parti.<br/>     Les R&eacute;publicains Unifi&eacute;s, au discours longtemps ambigu quant &agrave; l'ind&eacute;pendance californienne, partisans acharn&eacute;s de la s&eacute;curit&eacute;, de la d&eacute;cence morale et du rel&acirc;chement fiscal.<br/>     La New Order Militia, r&eacute;put&eacute;e pour ses coups de force (au sens propre comme figur&eacute;), fond&eacute;e par un ex-ganger, bien d&eacute;cid&eacute;e &agrave; jouer les emp&ecirc;cheurs de tourner en rond et &agrave; bousculer les partis traditionnels. Son credo : toutes les minorit&eacute;s sont bonnes &agrave; d&eacute;fendre... pourvu qu'elles soient 100% californiennes.<br/>     Les Nouveaux Lib&eacute;raux, d&eacute;fenseurs de l'Etat minimal o&ugrave; chaque chose doit &ecirc;tre l&eacute;galis&eacute;e et autoris&eacute;e au nom de la loi de la demande. Naturellement, le parti se fait le chantre de la privatisation absolue, &agrave; commencer par celle de la police - pour le plus grand bien des citoyens, cela va de soi.<br/>     Les R&eacute;alistes, qui se d&eacute;marquent des autres partis par leur statut de religieux et de business-men assum&eacute;s. Une structure h&eacute;t&eacute;rog&egrave;ne et touche-&agrave;-tout, retomb&eacute;e dans l'ombre m&eacute;diatique, mais qui sait se montrer patiente et changer son fusil d'&eacute;paule (le succ&egrave;s du brevet &quot;Larger than Life&quot; en &eacute;tant la preuve).<br/>     Et enfin les Compagnons, qui semblent avoir le vent en poupe depuis leur accession &agrave; la mairie de Los Angeles. Mais au final; s'agit-il de penseurs boh&ecirc;mes ou de r&eacute;els hommes et femmes de terrain ? Les &eacute;lecteurs commencent &agrave; se poser la question et leur sanction risque de tomber t&ocirc;t ou tard. Reste un point encore n&eacute;buleux : les origines du parti. Un point crucial, alors que l'on suppose d'anciens liens entre Kristin Lane et certains &eacute;co-terroristes...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>A l'exception des D&eacute;mocrates et des Lib&eacute;raux, chaque parti voit son discours et ses projets explicit&eacute;s, sans oublier un portrait de ses figures les plus pro&eacute;minentes et influentes. En encart : une interview du maire Kristin Lane, interrog&eacute;e sur l'actualit&eacute; tant de son parti que de la municipalit&eacute;.<br/><br/>Avant-derni&egrave;re partie du chapitre : la mairie de Los Angeles. La visite d&eacute;bute par quelques donn&eacute;es techniques et architecturales, avant d'embrayer avec l'&eacute;quipe en place (maire, conseil de ville, &quot;controller&quot;, procureur g&eacute;n&eacute;ral), chaque membre ayant une fonction et des attributions bien pr&eacute;cises. Tout comme le Central du LAPD, la mairie est un v&eacute;ritable mille-feuilles, chaque &eacute;tage comprenant un service ou un d&eacute;partement distinct, le tout brassant un budget colossal de 6 milliards de dollars ! De m&ecirc;me, cette partie d&eacute;peint la politique actuelle de l'&eacute;quipe Lane, explore les sous-sols de la mairie et &eacute;tudie les rapports entre la municipalit&eacute; et la police ; rapports tant officiels, la mairie nommant le bureau charg&eacute; d'&eacute;lire le chef de la police et votant le budget du LAPD, qu'officieux, la mairie poss&eacute;dant de nombreux leviers pour bloquer la carri&egrave;re ou entraver le travail de policiers g&ecirc;nants. Un encart est d'ailleurs r&eacute;v&eacute;lateur de cet &eacute;tat de fait, r&eacute;sumant le remboursement des d&eacute;gradations lors d'une intervention de la police - et l'addition grimpe vite, tr&egrave;s vite...<br/><br/>Pour conclure, les relations internationales, divis&eacute;es en grands blocs : les Am&eacute;riques, la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Europa, la Russie, l'Afrique, l'Asie et l'Australie. Cette partie suit le sch&eacute;ma suivant :<br/><br/>     Tout d'abord, chaque pays majeur dispose d'une position plus ou moins positive ou n&eacute;gative vis-&agrave;-vis de la Californie (ex&eacute;crable pour l'Union, au beau fixe pour Europa, trop bonne pour &ecirc;tre honn&ecirc;te pour le Japon).<br/>     Puis quelques paragraphes viennent pr&eacute;senter la situation et l'organisation du pays. A l'honneur : Europa (en plein d&eacute;s&eacute;quilibre est/ouest), la Russie (qui ronge son frein apr&egrave;s de trop nombreuses d&eacute;faites) et l'Afrique (victime d'une colonisation nouvelle version en vue de prot&eacute;ger les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts occidentaux, &agrave; laquelle la Californie participe activement).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Viennent &agrave; pr&eacute;sent les Affaires en cours, en d'autres termes les enqu&ecirc;tes pr&ecirc;tes &agrave; l'usage. Pour commencer, quatre 10-18 sur fond de vol de voiture, de descente en bo&icirc;te de nuit mal fam&eacute;e et d'homicides, avant de parvenir &agrave; deux sc&eacute;narios :<br/><br/>Omni mundis creatura, qui fait suite au sc&eacute;nario &quot;Un homme est mort&quot; du suppl&eacute;ment Saison 1-6 (Mai/Juin 2031): Helter Skelter. Les cops devront affronter l'une de leurs vieilles n&eacute;m&eacute;sis, tout en acceptant de jouer les morts pendant quelques jours. Soit ils se montrent les plus rapides et les plus malins, soit leur adversaire leur rejoue la sc&egrave;ne de fin de &quot;Fight Club&quot; avant de dispara&icirc;tre, au choix. Et reste &agrave; savoir si les cops pr&eacute;f&eacute;reront sauver leurs amis ou Downtown, choix &ocirc; combien corn&eacute;lien...<br/><br/>Teen trouble, o&ugrave; les cops se frotteront &agrave; la jeunesse d'en haut et d'en bas de Los Angeles. Charg&eacute;s de jouer la vitrine de la police lors des Semaines Citoyennes au sein de la prestigieuse universit&eacute; d'UCLA et de tenir bon face &agrave; un auditoire, les personnages devront &eacute;galement faire route plein sud pour r&eacute;soudre le viol et le meurtre d'une &eacute;l&egrave;ve sans histoires, dans l'enceinte d'un coll&egrave;ge miteux de South Central.<br/><br/>Pour clore ce suppl&eacute;ment, les Dossiers du SAD :<br/><br/>     Tout d'abord plusieurs rapports des services secrets, en rapport avec l'interview du &quot;porteur de valises&quot; cit&eacute; plus haut, qui prouvent &agrave; quel point l'ind&eacute;pendance est loin d'&ecirc;tre aussi simple (et innocente) qu'on l'aurait cru.<br/>     Puis les dossiers complets de William Ross et de Dexter Millius, respectivement Pr&eacute;sident de la R&eacute;publique et Gouverneur de la Californie. Deux tableaux r&eacute;sument &eacute;galement en quelques traits le signalement et la psychologie des principaux &eacute;lus nationaux et f&eacute;d&eacute;raux.<br/>     Quelques r&egrave;gles sont pr&eacute;sent&eacute;es, pour simuler les diff&eacute;rents moyens de pression des hommes politiques pour barrer la route &agrave; la police. Une nouvelle comp&eacute;tence appara&icirc;t au m&ecirc;me moment : Politique.<br/>     Pour faire suite &agrave; ces pressions, diff&eacute;rents paragraphes pr&eacute;sentent les tracasseries administratives que peuvent encourir les cops s'ils d&eacute;sirent obtenir et conclure une affaire criminelle, selon les situations.<br/>     Par ailleurs, il reste &agrave; &eacute;tudier la face cach&eacute;e et parfois peu reluisante des partis politiques et de la mairie de Los Angeles.<br/>     Pour terminer, plusieurs synopsis pour lier les cops &agrave; la politique internationale, &agrave; la sant&eacute; publique ainsi qu'&agrave; un homicide commis par un coll&egrave;gue.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Translation courtesy of Google:<br/><br/>July 4, 2026: a date flagship for the fledgling Republic of California, a symbol of independence and secession from the Union, but what about a few years later, while the City of Angels celebrates the advent 2032? This supplement and raises the curtain on the backstage of secession on California politics local, federal and international levels, the major parties and lobbies, as well as the mayor of Los Angeles.<br/><br/>As usual, the supplement includes a section LAPD blues, giving the pulse unit PSC day. Thus, the investigation into the murder of Detective Cortez progresses while crossing veterans and new faces of the PSC, evoking in turn return &quot;Proc&quot;, beating Brad Simpson woes &quot;No Bowl&quot; Webster and restarting the coffee machine.<br/><br/>The supplement then connects with the first chapter, the LAPD Records. To start, a return on the declaration of independence of California, through an interview with a &quot;carrier bags&quot; uncompromising - in other words a good look away from the official history textbooks, which raises many questions about the means used during the secession and major players of the time. In the end, that manipulates that the EU, California and such person or consortium? Backtracking on twenty years of political shade. A report to and fro several inserts, dedicated to lobbying (whether political, financial, environmental, technological and ideological - and more or less dangerous) as well as news of all police and judicial Los Angeles.<br/>Then it's time to get a more neutral of the Republic, with a study of its components, its organization and its institutions. Despite its name, some also offer to modify the Republic of California is not limited only to Golden State, but also includes Hawaii and Nevada, three states forming a federation modeled on the old USA.<br/><br/>First step: the federal state, with its constitution, legislative and executive, the judiciary and federal agencies (police or otherwise). This will also be the opportunity to discover Sacramento, the capital of the Republic so that the state of California - a combination sometimes indigestible, so that some are considering a transfer of power in Los Angeles. But the crime rate in the city records previously plead against him ... Another bone of contention: the representativeness of Hawaii and Nevada in Congress against the powerful California - what can the eight representatives of the two states face the fifty-five representatives from California?<br/>Second step: the state of California, with turn its constitution and national institutions.<br/><br/>Third step, &quot;Bear with three heads&quot;, aka the often complex overlap of federal, national and local. The cops are here directly concerned, as this will overlay the cross sooner or later agents as county sheriff, police in such municipality, the California Highway Patrol, military and federal agencies. In this case, who is responsible and who can put pressure on the other? Other questions arise, such as voting, planning for future elections, corruption in 2032 and the political jargon.<br/>The rest is devoted to the major parties in California, the MJ and PJ may have already discovered in the municipal elections of late 2030. Six great national movements carve the lion's share, respectively: <br/><br/>     The Visionaries Democrats, who count among their ranks some of the most popular actors of independence. But their eviction from the Los Angeles City Hall and accusations of weakness and fear a decline demagoguery leave the party. <br/>     The Republicans Unified, long ambiguous discourse about the independence California, strong supporters of the safety, moral decency and fiscal laxity. <br/>     The New Order Militia, known for its strength shots (literally as figuratively), founded by an ex-ganger, determined to play troublemakers turning round and upset the traditional parties. His credo: all minorities are good at defending ... provided they are 100% California. <br/>     The New Liberal advocates minimal state where everything should be legalized and authorized on behalf of the law of demand. Naturally, the party is the champion of privatization absolute, starting with the police - for the greater good of the citizens, of course. <br/>     The Realists, who stand by the other parties of their status and religious business-men assumed. A heterogeneous structure and key to all fallen in the shadow media, but who knows how patient and change his tune (the success of the patent &quot;Larger than Life&quot; being proof). <br/>     And finally the companions, who seem to have the wind in their sails since their accession to the Los Angeles City Hall. But in the end, is it bohemian thinkers or real men and women in the field? Voters begin to question and punishment may fall sooner or later. Still remains a nebulous: the origins of the party. A crucial point, while the former is assumed links between Kristin Lane and some eco-terrorists ...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>With the exception of Liberals and Democrats, each party sees his speech and explained projects, plus a portrait of its most prominent figures and influential. Inset: an interview with Mayor Kristin Lane, questioned the timeliness of his party as the municipality.<br/><br/>Penultimate section of the chapter, the mayor of Los Angeles. The tour begins with some technical and architectural, before engaging with the team in place (mayor, city council, &quot;controller&quot; Attorney General), each member having a function and functions very precise. As the Central LAPD, City Hall is a true multi-layered, each stage comprising a separate department or service, all stirring a huge budget of $ 6 billion! Similarly, this section depicts the current political team Lane, explores the basement of the town hall and study the relationship between the municipality and the police reports as official, the mayor appointing the office to elect the head of the police budget and voting LAPD, informal, town hall with many levers to block or impede career police work annoying. An insert is also indicative of this fact, summarizing the reimbursement of damage during a police intervention - and adding climbing fast, very fast ...<br/><br/>To conclude, international relations, divided into main blocks: the Americas, Europa Federation, Russia, Africa, Asia and Australia. This section follows the following pattern: <br/><br/>     First of all, every major country has a more or less positive or negative vis-&agrave;-vis California (execrable for the Union in good shape for Europa, too good to be honest for Japan). <br/>     Then just a few paragraphs present the status and organization of the country. In honor Europa (open imbalance east / west), Russia (chomping at the bit after too many defeats) and Africa (victim of colonization new version to protect Western interests, which California is actively involved).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Affairs are now in progress, in other words, surveys ready for use. To begin with, four 10-18 backdrop of car theft, descent nightclub and disreputable homicide before reaching two scenarios:<br/><br/>Omni mundis creatura, following the scenario &quot;A man is dead&quot; supplement Helter Skelter . The cops will face one of their old nemesis, while agreeing to play dead for a few days. Either they show faster and smarter, their opponent is their replays the scene end of &quot;Fight Club&quot; before disappearing, either. And the question remains whether the cops prefer to save their friends or Downtown, oh agonizing choice ...<br/><br/>Teen disorder where the cops will rub the youth of the top and bottom of Los Angeles. Responsibility of acting showcase for the police during Weeks Citizens in the prestigious University of UCLA and keep good front of an audience, the characters will also make road south to solve the rape and murder of a student without stories in the confines of a shabby South Central College.<br/>To close this supplement, SAD Files: <br/><br/>     Firstly several intelligence reports in relation to the interview &quot;carrier bags&quot; quoted above, which show how independence is far from as simple (and innocent) we would have thought. <br/>     Then complete records of William Ross and Dexter Millius, respectively President and Governor of California. Two tables also summarize in a few lines reporting and psychology major state and federal elected. <br/>     Some rules are presented to simulate the different ways of pressure politicians to block the road to the police. A new skill at the same time is: Politics. <br/>     In response to these pressures, different paragraphs present the paperwork that may be incurred if the cops seeking and conclude a criminal case, depending on the situation. <br/>     In addition, there is to study the hidden and sometimes lackluster political parties and the mayor of Los Angeles. <br/>     Finally, several synopsis for linking cops to international politics, public health and to a homicide committed by a colleague.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "131022": {"poll": [], "name": "Dark Strokes: Sins of the Fathers", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android Collector's edition", "Macintosh Downloadable (Collector's Edition) edition", "Macintosh Downloadable Edition", "Windows Downloadable (Collector's Edition) edition", "Windows Downloadable Edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1470395.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Detective / Mystery"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Alawar Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["Hidden Object", "Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "Macintosh", "Windows"], "average": "4", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Alawar Entertainment", "Big Fish Games", "Focus Multimedia"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1470395_t.jpg", "description": "Guide Ethan Black as he attempts to rescue his bride-to-be from a terrifying menace known as the Faceless Ones in Dark Strokes: Sins of the Fathers!

Play continues until all 56 booty cards have been distributed, and whoever acquires the most cards wins.<br/><br/>Reckless Mutiny includes variants for more experienced players. One variant use the money cards in the booty deck, with the captains needing to place all of these cards in numerical order. Thus, if a money card is drawn, the player must recall all the other money cards already played and place that card in the right position. In another variant you flip a coin to determine whether you place booty cards as in the basic game or whether you place them on a card that shares at least one common characteristic (color or kind of booty).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["HABA Dutch Multilingual first edition", "HABA French Multilingual first edition", "Multilingual first edition (German packaging)"], "age": "7", "name": "Reckless Mutiny", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Memory"], "average": "6.25", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": ["HABA Fex: Fostering Executive Functions series"]}, "131034": {"rpgartist": ["Jason Engle"], "rpgitemversion": ["Castle Grimstead"], "poll": [], "name": "Castle Grimstead", "rpghonor": ["2013 Origins Awards Best Gaming Accessory Nominee"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1469064.jpg", "usersrated": "5", "rpgdesigner": ["Peter Lee"], "average": "7.2", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (4th Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Wizards of the Coast"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["DN - Dungeon Tiles"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1469064_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Your tabletop never looked better!

At first I created this book as an material collection to use at my gaming table to play a space opera campaign. It was started by scouring all the available Sci Fi conversions for Savage Worlds I could find. There were bits and pieces I liked, but not a whole book I could simply take and use. I wanted some generic but iconic weapons, armors and equipment. Using them without their background required tweaking in some and a total rewrite of item descriptions in many cases. Soon I decicided to create  new &ldquo;generic&rdquo; material.<br/><br/>During writing I had more ideas and started to write them down too. So it grew bit by bit. Savage Space took weeks to complete and everything went through several iterations and optimizations thanks to feedback I received. There are two sections I am incredibly proud of. One is the chapter and rules for Space Ships as Characters. They were the piece that originally drew the most attention and at the same time the most challenging to write in the first place. And on the other hand the Adventure Generator. That was a lot of fun to come up with, as I am a huge fan of those to fuel my creativity.<br/><br/>Hopefully I succeeded in staying &ldquo;generic&rdquo;, it was harder than I had originally thought. We all have our own preconceptions of a Sci Fi setting and they inadvertently creep into our writing. That is why I have included a one page description of my setting on the next page, so you get an idea what I think of when I say &ldquo;Generic&rdquo;.<br/><br/>If you plan any form of Sci Fi Campaign in Savage Worlds I heartily suggest you also have a look at the Savage Worlds Sci Fi Toolkits and the Daring Tales of the Space Lanes adventures from Triple Ace Games. The latter are not only interesting adventures, but they also contain lots of great rules and tools to create an awesome space opera campaign with a slightly pulpy note. I use them in addition to this book.<br/><br/>"}, "131054": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Excision"], "statistics": [], "name": "Excision", "rpgdesigner": ["James Mullen"], "rpgproducer": ["James Mullen"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1426097.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Crime (Spy / Espionage)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Groundhoggoth"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1426097_t.png", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>The first step in creating an agent is coming up with a concept: each agent should not only fill a role on the team but have a distinct personality &amp; background.

En d'autres termes, OSS 666 d&eacute;peint la communaut&eacute; n&eacute;buleuse de l'espionnage et du contre-espionnage, la jeune arm&eacute;e californienne et le monde en vase clos des corporations ; sans oublier deux probl&egrave;mes majeurs pos&eacute;s &agrave; la police, &agrave; deux &eacute;chelles totalement diff&eacute;rents : la menace terroriste d'une part, le ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne grandissant de privatisation des services publics d'autre part. Et qui dit fin de saison dit &eacute;galement rebondissement et r&eacute;v&eacute;lations, mais il en sera question plus loin dans cette fiche.<br/><br/>En guise d'introduction, on retrouve la traditionnelle rubrique &quot;LAPD Blues&quot; qui donne le pouls au sein du Central. Changement de perspective &agrave; cette occasion, au travers du journal d&eacute;sabus&eacute; du m&eacute;decin traitant du COPS. A d&eacute;faut de pouvoir soigner ses patients comme il l'entendrait, au moins peut-il recueillir certaines confidences, tant&ocirc;t graves, tant&ocirc;t l&eacute;g&egrave;res. Plus loin, quelques articles de journaux de la presse californienne et &eacute;trang&egrave;re, qui offrent les derni&egrave;res actualit&eacute;s &iquest; &eacute;v&egrave;nements majeurs comme nouvelles plus futiles.<br/><br/>Vient &agrave; pr&eacute;sent le d&eacute;veloppement des th&egrave;mes &eacute;voqu&eacute;s ci-dessus, avec en tout premier lieu l'univers de l'espionnage ou - doux euph&eacute;misme - du renseignement. Sont d&eacute;crits les six services les plus m&eacute;diatiques, les plus efficaces et les plus redout&eacute;s du globe. <br/><br/>     Figure embl&eacute;matique de l'Union, la Central Intelligence Agency ouvre le bal. La lente transformation du restant des USA en &eacute;tat policier a grandement renforc&eacute; les pouvoirs de la CIA, d&eacute;sormais habilit&eacute;e &agrave; agir &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur comme &agrave; l'ext&eacute;rieur du pays. Sont pass&eacute;s en revue, ainsi que pour les autres agences, son mode de fonctionnement et d'organisation, ses diverses sources et techniques de renseignement, ses liens plus ou moins avouables, le tout accompagn&eacute; de quelques l&eacute;gendes urbaines plus d&eacute;lirantes les unes que les autres. Mais la CIA &eacute;tant abonn&eacute;e aux coups tordus, qui peut r&eacute;ellement distinguer le vrai du faux ? <br/>     Face &agrave; la CIA, son jeune adversaire californien, la Californian Internal Security Agency, cr&eacute;&eacute;e dans l'urgence de la S&eacute;cession. Si elle n'a ni le budget ni la technologie dont dispose la CIA, la CISA compense par des sources plus diversifi&eacute;es et par des attributions particuli&egrave;rement floues &iquest; comprendre, particuli&egrave;rement larges. L&agrave; encore, quelques l&eacute;gendes urbaines pour, au choix, sourire ou craindre le pire. <br/>     De l'autre c&ocirc;t&eacute; de l'Atlantique, deux agences r&egrave;gnent en ma&icirc;tres. A l'ouest, le BundesNachrichtenDienst, au service de la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Europa ; &agrave; l'est, le Glavnoye Razvedovatelnoye Upravlenie russe. R&eacute;f&eacute;rence mondiale en mati&egrave;re d'antiterrorisme, le BND talonne &agrave; l'heure actuelle la toute puissante CIA, en disposant cependant d'une bien meilleure image de marque. Pour autant, une poign&eacute;e de journaux europ&eacute;ens d&eacute;nonce ce qui semble devenir petit &agrave; petit une police politique... Info ou intox ? Quant au GRU, son efficacit&eacute; n'a d'&eacute;quivalent que sa cruaut&eacute;, h&eacute;ritage de l'&egrave;re sovi&eacute;tique. Et tandis que la Russie fait son retour en force sur la sc&egrave;ne internationale, plus agressive et d&eacute;termin&eacute;e que jamais, les militaires du GRU ne sont pas en reste et affermissent leur pr&eacute;sence aux quatre coins du monde. <br/>     Service encore exp&eacute;rimental, l'Ag&ecirc;ncia Internacional Antidrogas dispose pour le moment de peu de moyens, mais sa motivation n'a rien &agrave; envier aux autres agences. L'AIA est n&eacute;e de l'alliance de plusieurs pays d'Am&eacute;rique Latine et d'Am&eacute;rique du Sud, d&eacute;sireux de combattre l'emprise sanglante des barons de la drogue et de leurs cartels, mais &eacute;galement l'ing&eacute;rence des militaires et espions nord-am&eacute;ricains, dont on se demande quel est le v&eacute;ritable camp. <br/>     Enfin, le Canadian Security Intelligence Service, acteur mineur dans la mesure o&ugrave; ses attributions sont bien plus r&eacute;duites que celles des agences ci-dessus. Pour autant, avec le voisinage des deux fr&egrave;res ennemis, Californie et Union, le CSIS ne risque pas de manquer de pain sur la planche... A noter que ce chapitre s'ach&egrave;ve sur un encadr&eacute; r&eacute;sumant les relations avec un agent secret, en tant qu'alli&eacute; ou informateur.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Deuxi&egrave;me milieu &eacute;voqu&eacute; : les forces arm&eacute;es californiennes, scind&eacute;es entre la CALGUARD - la Garde Nationale californienne - et la CASDF - les forces d'autod&eacute;fense californiennes - cette derni&egrave;re r&eacute;unissant arm&eacute;e de terre, arm&eacute;e de l'air et marine. A chacune son haut-commandement, ses attributions et son organisation, en sachant que les cops croiseront t&ocirc;t ou tard les hommes de la CALGUARD, habitu&eacute;s &agrave; pr&ecirc;ter main forte en cas d'&eacute;meute, d'&eacute;v&eacute;nement majeur ou de catastrophe naturelle. Cette section offre &eacute;galement la liste des principales bases militaires californiennes, des personnalit&eacute;s les plus c&eacute;l&egrave;bres des forces arm&eacute;es, des strat&eacute;gies et op&eacute;rations en cours de l'&eacute;tat-major. Pour terminer, reste le mat&eacute;riel propre &agrave; l'arm&eacute;e : armement, v&eacute;hicules terrestres et a&eacute;riens, t&eacute;l&eacute;communications et bases de donn&eacute;es, sans oublier le jargon et l'humour propres aux soldats. Comme pour les espions, un tableau pr&eacute;sente les militaires en tant qu'informateurs et alli&eacute;s des personnages.<br/><br/>Troisi&egrave;me milieu : le terrorisme en Californie, qui ne cesse de gagner en importance. Suite &agrave; des consid&eacute;rations sur la d&eacute;finition de terrorisme et &agrave; un r&eacute;capitulatif des actes terroristes les plus retentissants depuis le 11 Septembre 2001, trois sections suivent : <br/><br/>     Le terrorisme local, c'est-&agrave;-dire le terrorisme purement californien, le moins &eacute;volu&eacute; mais celui auquel la police est le plus souvent confront&eacute;e. Cette mosa&iuml;que regroupe p&ecirc;le-m&ecirc;le les Unionistes et autres nostalgiques de l'avant S&eacute;cession, les Natifs lass&eacute;s de l'inertie du nouvel &eacute;tat californien, les sempiternels opposants &agrave; l'&eacute;tat f&eacute;d&eacute;ral nourris aux images de Waco, ainsi que bon nombre de groupuscules communautaristes plus ou moins dangereux et s&eacute;rieux. <br/>     Le terrorisme international, d'une toute autre envergure, divis&eacute; entre luttes religieuses, &eacute;cologistes et anarchistes. Trois appellations particuli&egrave;rement larges voire artificielles, o&ugrave; l'on croise aussi bien d'authentiques mafieux que des id&eacute;alistes fid&egrave;les &agrave; leurs engagements et autres fous de Dieu. Sans oublier qu'ici les moyens sont r&eacute;els. <br/>     La lutte anti-terroriste, ce qui sous-entend d&eacute;finir l'infraction terroriste, appr&eacute;hender le fonctionnement des cellules et distinguer les proc&eacute;d&eacute;s et limites des divers groupements : en somme, lesquels iront r&eacute;ellement jusqu'au bout ? Plusieurs tableaux apportent des &eacute;claircissements : statistiques des attentats, groupes les plus recherch&eacute;s, attributions anti-terroristes au sein des forces civiles et militaires californiennes, relations avec les terroristes en tant qu'alli&eacute;s et relations.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Cependant, si les terroristes contestent leur autorit&eacute; aux &eacute;tats, d'autres entit&eacute;s poursuivent le m&ecirc;me combat, &agrave; leur mani&egrave;re : les corporations et multinationales. Combat apparemment &agrave; leur avantage, preuve en est le succ&egrave;s de l'achat et de la &quot;privatisation&quot; du Lib&eacute;ria, du Laos et du Salvador. A cette occasion, le suppl&eacute;ment d&eacute;taille la situation nouvelle des trois pays et de leurs habitants, d&eacute;sormais propri&eacute;t&eacute;s priv&eacute;es de leurs corporations respectives, avant de d&eacute;velopper le concept de &quot;franchise corporatiste&quot; - autrement dit de quartier ou ville dont les services publics sont tomb&eacute;s, l&eacute;galement, aux mains d'une entreprise priv&eacute;e, pour le meilleur et pour le pire. La Californie n'&eacute;chappe pas au ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne, trois comt&eacute;s ayant d&eacute;j&agrave; c&eacute;d&eacute; leurs pouvoirs en mati&egrave;re de police ; prochaine &eacute;tape, Los Angeles ?<br/><br/>Enfin, une derni&egrave;re section : la sph&egrave;re internationale, d&eacute;taillant l'organisation des affaires &eacute;trang&egrave;res californiennes, la politique d'immigration du pays et le pr&eacute;cieux statut des diplomates. Par mesure de simplification, les relations avec les d&eacute;l&eacute;gations &eacute;trang&egrave;res sont r&eacute;parties en quatre cat&eacute;gories : pays amis, neutres, suspects et hostiles, l'Union rentrant naturellement dans la derni&egrave;re cat&eacute;gorie. Suite aux pays, le suppl&eacute;ment encha&icirc;ne avec une demi-douzaine d'organisations internationales : ONU et OTAN - dont les fonctions ont &eacute;t&eacute; plus que modifi&eacute;es, le plus souvent affaiblies, en 30 ans d'histoire - organisations sportives et enfin ONG, plus particuli&egrave;rement Greenpeace, Amnesty et AltraMundi. Pour terminer, quelques consid&eacute;rations qui int&eacute;resseront davantage les policiers : la condition l&eacute;gale des &eacute;trangers en Californie, le processus d'extradition d'un suspect et le recours possible &agrave; Interpol.<br/><br/>La section r&eacute;serv&eacute;e aux MJ d&eacute;bute, comme &agrave; l'accoutum&eacute;e, par les &quot;affaires en cours&quot;, autrement dit les sc&eacute;narios. Fin de saison oblige, l'une des affaires ci-dessous modifiera l'univers de COPS en profondeur, selon les actions et le talent des joueurs. En premier lieu, quatre mini enqu&ecirc;tes 10-18, qui m&ecirc;lent crime sexuel, diplomatie, traque d'un tueur en s&eacute;rie et vengeance sanglante - cette derni&egrave;re enqu&ecirc;te &eacute;tant d'ailleurs introduite par une nouvelle - avant de passer &agrave; deux sc&eacute;narios complets : <br/><br/>     &quot;L'homme qui venait de Dczaniveria&quot;, qui entra&icirc;nera les personnages dans les ruelles du petit quartier polonais de Los Angeles, r&eacute;put&eacute; havre de paix pour troisi&egrave;me &acirc;ge. Les meurtres s'accumulent du jour au lendemain, le voisinage sombre dans la panique la plus totale et l'on en vient &agrave; craindre les agissements d'une cr&eacute;ature surnaturelle. Aux cops de garder leur sang-froid et de restaurer le calme, dans ce quartier jusque-l&agrave; mod&egrave;le. <br/>     &quot;Ice Crime&quot;, o&ugrave; le masque tombe pour l'un des membres familiers du COPS. S'ajoutent &agrave; cela des remous dans la mafia russe, un attentat au gaz, la rumeur comme quoi l'&eacute;quipe Lane souhaiterait faire le m&eacute;nage au sein du LAPD, et enfin une crise internationale suite &agrave; une grave pollution maritime dans le Pacifique Nord... Cerise sur le g&acirc;teau : pour esp&eacute;rer avancer dans ce fatras, les cops auront &agrave; s'allier &agrave; leur pire ennemi au sein de la police : le SAD en personne !<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>En dernier lieu, viennent les secrets r&eacute;serv&eacute;s aux MJ, autrement dit la version non censur&eacute;e des dossiers d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s ci-dessus : <br/><br/>     Les services secrets et leurs placards jonch&eacute;s de squelettes. Si personne ne doute des m&eacute;thodes brutales de la CIA ou du GRU et de leurs contacts plus ou moins r&eacute;guliers avec le crime organis&eacute;, les autres agences sont loin d'&ecirc;tre totalement exemplaires, quand elles n'&eacute;chappent pas totalement ou partiellement au contr&ocirc;le de leurs gouvernements de tutelle. Pour chaque service : quelques secrets f&acirc;cheux, le portrait revu et corrig&eacute; de ses personnalit&eacute;s, ainsi que le profil type de ses agents de terrain. <br/>     Les proc&eacute;dures d'intervention de la Garde Nationale et ses rapports avec l'arm&eacute;e et la police. Diverses questions sont &eacute;galement &eacute;voqu&eacute;es, comme la juridiction de la police militaire et le d&eacute;sir d'accorder &agrave; CALGUARD des pouvoirs en mati&egrave;re de maintien de l'ordre. <br/>     La philosophie de l'arm&eacute;e californienne, de m&ecirc;me que ses relations avec l'ext&eacute;rieur comme l'int&eacute;rieur ; l'organisation de la police militaire, qui redonne tout son sens &agrave; l'expression &quot;Grande Muette&quot; ; les projets confidentiels en cours ou pr&ecirc;ts &agrave; &ecirc;tre ex&eacute;cut&eacute;s ; les services de renseignement militaires, dont les ambitions plus ou moins conformes sont pour le moment stopp&eacute;es par les coupures budg&eacute;taires. Cependant, la fronde se pr&eacute;pare... <br/>     La section terrorisme, qui d&eacute;cortique trois mouvements parmi les plus dangereux en Californie et pr&eacute;sente l'une des figures les plus ambigu&euml;s de l'univers de COPS : le groupuscule Unity - qui vise &agrave; rattacher la Californie &agrave; l'Union - la n&eacute;buleuse N&eacute;o Islam -qui voit la Californie comme une nouvelle Terre Sainte - la Fraternit&eacute; Armageddon - persuad&eacute;e de l'existence d'une conspiration au sein du r&eacute;gime europ&eacute;en - et enfin Mr Hide - le plus c&eacute;l&egrave;bre pirate informatique au monde &iquest; l'un des codes rouges les plus br&ucirc;lants du jeu. <br/>     Les zones corporatistes et le d&eacute;licat respect des lois en leur enceinte, &agrave; savoir qui est comp&eacute;tent : police ou s&eacute;curit&eacute; int&eacute;rieure ? D&eacute;licat, car la r&eacute;ponse peut tr&egrave;s bien varier entre th&eacute;orie et pratique. Trois exemples concrets viennent illustrer ce probl&egrave;me : la mainmise d'Otwaku sur les surfeurs de Venice Beach ; la s&eacute;dation des ouvriers de la Tumeur par Norwalk Paradise ; enfin, la privatisation de trois services de sh&eacute;rif par le consortium EAGLE, dernier camouflet en date inflig&eacute; au service public par les corporations. Et ce qui n'est pour l'instant qu'une &quot;exp&eacute;rience&quot; risque fort de s'&eacute;tendre au reste de la Californie... <br/>     Pour terminer, une page d&eacute;volue aux relations internationales : trois projets en cours, de haut vol, qui modifieront d'une mani&egrave;re ou d'une autre la position californienne au sein de la communaut&eacute; internationale, en la consolidant ou en l'affaiblissant, d'un cas &agrave; l'autre. Et si une poign&eacute;e de flics venait mettre son nez dans les parages et bousculait ces plans soigneux ?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Translation courtesy of Google:<br/><br/>Last supplement of the second season of COPS, OSS 666 opens new horizons for Los Angeles police officers: different areas, unfortunately for them, a plate detective will very little weight to loosen tongues and investigate . In other words, OSS 666 depicts the community Nebula spying and espionage against the young army California and the world in isolation corporations, as well as two major problems to the police, two totally different scales : the threat of terrorism on the one hand, the growing phenomenon of privatization of public services on the other. And said end of said season also rebound and revelations, but will be discussed later in this form.<br/><br/>As an introduction, we find the traditional heading &quot;LAPD Blues&quot; which gives the pulse in the Central. Change of perspective on this occasion, through the newspaper's disillusioned doctor PSC. Failing to treat his patients as he pleased, at least he can collect some confidences, sometimes serious, sometimes light. Further, some newspaper articles from foreign press and California, offering the latest news events such as new &iquest;most trivial.<br/>Now comes the development of the themes mentioned above, first and foremost with the world of espionage - brainer - intelligence. Describes the six most media services, most effective and most feared in the world. <br/><br/>     Emblematic of the Union, the Central Intelligence Agency opens the ball. The slow transformation of the remaining U.S. into a police state has greatly strengthened the powers of the CIA, now empowered to act within and outside the country. Are reviewed, as well as other agencies, its operation and organization, its various sources and technical information, links, more or less worthy, all accompanied by some urban legends craziest each other . But the CIA is subscribed to dirty tricks, which can really distinguish true from false? <br/>     Facing the CIA, his younger opponent California, the Californian Internal Security Agency, created in the urgency of the Secession. If it has neither the budget nor the technology available to the CIA, CISA offset by more diversified sources and attributions fuzzy &iquest;particularly understand, especially wide. Again, for some urban legends, choice, smile or fear the worst. <br/>     On the other side of the Atlantic, two agencies reign supreme. To the west, the Bundesnachrichtendienst, serving Federation Europa; east, the Russian Glavnoye Razvedovatelnoye Upravlenie. Global benchmark in anti-terrorism, the BND heels now the powerful CIA, however, have a much better brand. However, a handful of European newspapers denouncing what seems gradually become a political police ... Info or intox? As for the GRU, its effectiveness has its equivalent cruelty legacy of the Soviet era. And while Russia made \u200b\u200bits comeback on the international stage, more aggressive and determined than ever, the GRU military are not still and steady presence around the world. <br/>     Service still experimental, the Agencia Internacional Antidrogas currently has few resources, but his motivation has nothing to envy to other agencies. AIA is born from the alliance of several countries in Latin America and South America, eager to fight the influence bloody drug lords and their cartels, but also the interference of the military and spies north American, which one wonders what is the real camp. <br/>     Finally, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, minor player in that its functions are much smaller than those of the agencies above. However, with the proximity of the two rivals, California and Union, CSIS will not fail to cut out ... Note that this chapter ends with a box summarizing the relationship a secret agent or informant as an ally.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Second medium mentioned: California armed forces, split between CALGUARD - California National Guard - and CASDF - California self-defense forces - the latter involving army, air force and navy. To each his high command, its functions and organization, knowing that the cops will cross sooner or later the CALGUARD men, accustomed to lend a hand in case of riot, major event or disaster. This section also provides a list of major military bases in California, the most famous personalities of the armed forces, strategies and ongoing operations of Staff. Finally, the material is suitable for army: arms, land and air vehicles, telecommunications and databases, without forgetting the jargon and humor own soldiers. As for spies, a table presents the military as informants and allies of the characters.<br/><br/>Third medium: Terrorism in California, which is gaining in importance. Following considerations on the definition of terrorism and a summary of the most sensational terrorism since September 11, 2001, the following three sections: <br/><br/>     The local terrorism, that is to say terrorism purely Californian, but less evolved which the police is often confronted. This mosaic includes jumble Unionists and other nostalgic forward Secession, Native tired of inertia of the new state California, the eternal opponents federal state fed images of Waco, and many factions communitarian more or less dangerous and serious. <br/>     International terrorism, a different magnitude, divided between religious strife, environmentalists and anarchists. Three appellations particularly large or artificial, where one crosses as well as authentic mafia idealistic faithful to their commitments and other fanatics. Not to mention here how are real. <br/>     The fight against terrorism, which implies defining the offense of terrorism, understanding how cells differentiate and processes and limitations of the various groups: in short, which actually go up at the end? Several tables provide clarification Statistics attacks, the most popular, anti-terrorism duties in the civilian and military Californian, relations with terrorists as allies and relationships.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>However, if terrorists challenging their authority to the states, other entities have the same fight in their own way and multinational corporations. Apparently fighting to their advantage, as shown by the success of the purchase and the &quot;privatization&quot; of Liberia, Laos and El Salvador. On this occasion, the supplement detailing the new situation of the three countries and their inhabitants, now private property of their respective corporations, before developing the concept of &quot;franchise corporatist&quot; - ie, neighborhood or city in which public services have fallen, legally in the hands of a private company, for better or for worse. California is no exception to this phenomenon, three counties have already transferred their powers to police next step, Los Angeles?<br/>Finally, the last section: the international sphere, detailing the organization Foreign Californian immigration policy of the country and the precious status of diplomats. For simplicity, relations with foreign delegations are divided into four categories: country friends, neutral, suspicious and hostile Union returning naturally in the latter category. Following the country continues with the extra half a dozen international organizations: UN and NATO - whose functions were more than modified, often weakened by 30 years of history - and finally sports organizations NGOs, especially Greenpeace, Amnesty and AltraMundi. Finally, some considerations more interested the police: the legal position of aliens in California, the process of extradition of a suspect and the possible use of Interpol.<br/><br/>The section reserved for MJ begins, as usual, by the &quot;current affairs&quot;, ie scenarios. End of the season requires, one of the cases below will change the world of PSC in depth, depending on the action and talent of the players. Firstly, four mini surveys 10-18, which combine sexual crime, diplomacy, hunt for a serial killer and bloody revenge - this latest survey is also introduced by a new one - before moving on to complete two scenarios: <br/><br/>     &quot;The man who had Dczaniveria&quot;, which will cause the characters in the streets of the small Polish neighborhood of Los Angeles, known haven for seniors. Murders accumulate overnight, the neighborhood in the dark with total panic and fear it comes to the actions of a supernatural creature. The cops keep their cool and restore calm in the area hitherto model. <br/>     &quot;Ice Crime&quot;, where the mask falls for one of the familiar members of the PSC. Add to that a stir in the Russian mafia, a gas attack, the rumor that the team would make the Lane household in the LAPD, and finally an international crisis following a serious marine pollution in the North Pacific. .. Icing on the cake to expect progress in this mess, the cops will have to join forces with their worst enemy in the police: the SAD person!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally come the secrets reserved for MJ, ie the uncensored files developed above: <br/><br/>     The secret services and their closets littered skeletons. If no doubt brutal methods of the CIA or the GRU and their more or less regular contacts with organized crime, other agencies are far from being completely copies when they can not escape totally or partially control their government regulators. For each service: some secrets unfortunate, revised and corrected the portrait of its personalities, and the typical profile of its field staff. <br/>     Response procedures of the National Guard and its relationship with the army and the police. Issues are also discussed, as the jurisdiction of the military police and the desire to give CALGUARD of powers of enforcement. <br/>     The philosophy of the army in California, as well as its relations with the outside as within, the organization of the military police, who gives full meaning to the term &quot;Grande Muette&quot;; confidential projects underway or ready to run, the military intelligence whose ambitions more or less comply are currently halted by budget cuts. However, the sling is preparing ... <br/>     Section terrorism, dissects three movements among the most dangerous in California and has one of the most ambiguous universe COPS: the small group Unity - which seeks to link the California Union - Nebula Neo-Islam sees California as a new Holy Land - Brotherhood Armageddon - convinced of the existence of a conspiracy within the European system - and finally Mr Hide - the most famous hacker world &iquest;one of the hottest red codes of the game <br/>     Areas corporatist and delicate respect for the law in their enclosure, to know who is responsible: police or Homeland Security? Delicate, because the answer may well vary between theory and practice. Three examples will illustrate this problem: the stranglehold of Otwaku on surfers from Venice Beach, sedation workers of the tumor by Norwalk Paradise, finally, the privatization of three services of the sheriff EAGLE consortium, dated last blow inflicted by public service corporations. And what is the moment that &quot;experience&quot; is likely to spread to the rest of California ... <br/>     Finally, a page devoted to international relations: three projects, high-flying, that will change one way or another position within the California international community, the strengthening or weakening of a case to another. And if a bunch of cops came to his nose around and hustled careful plans?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "131058": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Patrick Stevens"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "First Emperor", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1436270_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Patrick Stevens"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Numbskull Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1436270.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "An area control game set in ancient China and Mongolia.

To maximize the concert feel, pictures taken at real concerts are used on the cards and guitar picks are the player pawns!<br/><br/>While Ready to Rock! is a pure card game, it also uses mechanisms of placement games. The rockers play their route cards, which represent the audience, then they move in different directions through the crowd so that in each match rockers will reach the front row through different paths.<br/><br/>Moreover to advance in every gig, rockers must obstruct other players' progress, perhaps pushing others back by using a special card or blocking their way with a wall card. What creates walls at a concert? Obviously the Mosh Pit, the Hell's Angels, and the Headbangers! A rocker once blocked should not despair as he can always change the direction of the crowd to open up new paths to move in other directions. In addition, Body Surfing might help you pass the obstacle and run toward the stage!<br/><br/>In the game, each rocker starts with four cards and can draw one card each turn. During his turn, he can play at most two cards. Cards are divided in three types: routes and walls &ndash; which have already been explained &ndash; and instants. The latter are bonuses he can use for himself (e.g., if you get &quot;beer&quot;, then you can draw two cards, or with &quot;flashing tits&quot; a player can use three cards in a turn) or against one opponent, such as &quot;ear plug&quot; (which makes him skip a turn), and &quot;smashed beer&quot; (which makes him discard two cards). There are also &quot;Ready to Rock!&quot; card, special cards that activate one of the stage cards to generate unforeseen effects on all rockers: &quot;special guest&quot; forces every rocker to draw one card, while &quot;shitty weather&quot; makes everyone discard one card and &quot;fire explosion&quot; muddles everything up by rotating all the path cards 180&ordm;.<br/><br/>Ready to Rock! is a game with a unique real setting and is easy to learn, although some strategy tips are essential to win the game. Given the content of some cards, the game is not suitable for children: for instance, in &quot;lots of beer&quot; there's a guy drinking two beers at once and in &quot;flashing tits&quot; a girl shows her tits to the entire stadium.

Rumeurs, l&eacute;gendes urbaines, fuites, bruits de couloirs et ragots de tous acabits - quand Los Angeles et la Californie se font leur propre cin&eacute;ma... Mais aussi farfelus soient-ils, certains bruits colport&eacute;s n'en sont pas moins empreints de v&eacute;rit&eacute; ; reste &agrave; distinguer le vrai du faux.<br/><br/>En premier lieu, Complots s'ouvre sur les notes d'ambiance famili&egrave;res : le quotidien de l'unit&eacute; COPS au travers de &quot;LAPD Blues&quot; (avec une insistance sur le personnage de Douglas Collins, aussi sympathique qu'une porte de prison) ainsi que la revue de presse internationale ; rude p&eacute;riode pour les dirigeants californiens, am&eacute;ricains et europ&eacute;ens, mis en cause pour divers scandales respectifs... Sans oublier les conseils pour perdre les kilos superflus, &eacute;t&eacute; 2032 oblige.<br/><br/>Suivent les dossiers du LAPD : sept chapitres regroupant les rumeurs par th&eacute;matiques pr&eacute;cises - respectivement la politique, le mysticisme, la criminalit&eacute;, la police, la ville de LA, la religion et la technologie. Chacune de ces th&eacute;matiques est analys&eacute;e suivant plusieurs points de vue : celui du monde de la rue, du Network, de la t&eacute;l&eacute;vision, des milieux autoris&eacute;s. Naturellement, tout ce petit monde aura son mot &agrave; dire bien particulier en la mati&egrave;re.<br/><br/>     Politique : passage en revue des coulisses de la R&eacute;publique de la Californie (&agrave; commencer par le myst&egrave;re Karen Hall) et des grands partis nationaux. Sans oublier les derniers scandales en date, les br&ucirc;lots les mieux vendus et une poign&eacute;e de complots. L'ONU, bras arm&eacute; de l'Union ? La Californie est-elle le jouet des francs-ma&ccedil;ons ? South Central, terrain de jeu des militaires ?<br/>     Mysticisme : on s'int&eacute;ressera ici &agrave; la philosophie et &agrave; la spiritualit&eacute; des Californiens, ainsi qu'aux domaines qui en subissent les influences, de l'alimentation aux jeux vid&eacute;o. Quel lien karmique unit les cops &agrave; leurs armes et masques ? Comment m&ecirc;ler feng-shui et di&eacute;t&eacute;tique ? Los Angeles est-elle un organisme vivant ?<br/>     Criminalit&eacute; : si les nouvelles guerres des cartels font couler beaucoup d'encre, la police aimerait bien d&eacute;couvrir qui d&eacute;nonce sans cesse ses agents infiltr&eacute;s, tandis que certains gangers semblent curieusement r&eacute;sister aux balles du SWAT. Par ailleurs, qui s'amuse &agrave; abattre les leaders des gangs afro-am&eacute;ricains ? Et o&ugrave; aura lieu le prochain concert de Jay BuDa ?<br/>     Police : il semblerait qu'un super-h&eacute;ros confonde Los Angeles avec Gotham City et qu'un &eacute;mule de Mad Max fasse r&eacute;gner sa propre justice sur les grandes art&egrave;res, au volant d'un v&eacute;hicule invisible. Reste toutes les rumeurs qui tournent autour des cops et du fondateur du service, Andrew Noone, cach&eacute; on ne sait o&ugrave;. De m&ecirc;me, pourquoi personne n'ose utiliser la patrouilleuse n&deg;013 ? Le commissariat de Duarte serait-il envo&ucirc;t&eacute; ? Quels sont les projets secrets de Kristin Lane quant au COPS ?<br/>     Ville de LA : architecture incoh&eacute;rente, effets de mode, &eacute;pid&eacute;mies de rats, autant d'&eacute;l&eacute;ments qui alimentent les rumeurs les plus folles... N'y aurait-il pas une quelconque volont&eacute; derri&egrave;re toutes ces bizarreries ? Reste &agrave; ajouter &agrave; tout ce fatras les meutes de requins qui r&ocirc;dent au large des plages angelinos, ainsi que des n&eacute;o-nazis un tant soit peu trop fans des films d'Indiana Jones.<br/>     Religion : les trois religions du livre se voient une fois encore pass&eacute;es en revue, dans la lign&eacute;e de Saison 1-4 (Jan./F\u00e9v. 2031): Gangsta Paradise et de Saison 1-6 (Mai/Juin 2031): Helter Skelter, avec le passage en revue de certains secrets - comme l'affrontement entre les deux papes catholiques, les myst&egrave;res du golem de Rabbi Yor Shevai ou la manipulation de la communaut&eacute; musulmane de Californie. Mais les autres mouvements religieux ne sont pas en reste, qu'il s'agisse des satanistes, des hindous, des am&eacute;rindiens ou des adeptes du New Age. Question : faut-il pr&ecirc;ter foi &agrave; une exp&eacute;rience baptis&eacute;e &quot;Akira&quot;, ou simples sp&eacute;culations ?<br/>     Technologie : difficile de passer &agrave; c&ocirc;t&eacute; de ce domaine, tant la d&eacute;pendance technologique de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; des ann&eacute;es 2030 s'est accentu&eacute;e. C'est ici l'occasion de revenir sur l'omnipr&eacute;sence du petit &eacute;cran et de certains de ses effets les plus d&eacute;sastreux, sur la r&eacute;volution Larger Than Life, sur l'existence suppos&eacute;e d'IA autonomes, sur l'hypoth&egrave;se d'une guerre homme/machine. Naturellement, les m&eacute;gacorporations qui profitent de ce march&eacute; florissant n'&eacute;chappent pas au crible... Reste, pour terminer, un sujet br&ucirc;lant : l'existence d'une vie extra-terrestre et toutes les cons&eacute;quences que cela a ou aurait.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>En second lieu, on retrouve le chapitre consacr&eacute; aux enqu&ecirc;tes, avec en pr&eacute;ambule trois 10-18. Au programme : robots devenus fous, alerte nucl&eacute;aire sur LA et un homme tomb&eacute; du ciel. Deux sc&eacute;narios plus fournis s'ensuivent :<br/><br/>     Le syndrome d'Alice : un vieil ennemi des cops refait surface, au moment o&ugrave; un d&eacute;ment s'amuse &agrave; empiler bon nombre de cadavres, d&eacute;ment qui entretient de bien curieuses relations avec ses victimes... avec une bien &eacute;trange surprise pour les personnages lorsque tomberont les masques.<br/>     Californian Babe : plong&eacute;e dans le milieu naus&eacute;abond de l'industrie du porno de Van Nuys, o&ugrave; les cops viendront en appui &agrave; la police locale. Mais lorsque leurs coll&egrave;gues du cru s'attireront bon nombre de soucis, les personnages auront &agrave; jouer avec une enqu&ecirc;te en cours, la mort d'un policier, les agissements de nervis de la milice de Van Nuys et les limiers du SAD - rude exercice d'&eacute;quilibriste. Et pourtant, de l'aide pourra&icirc;t bien provenir d'un alli&eacute; impr&eacute;vu : rien de moins qu'une m&eacute;gacorporation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>La toute derni&egrave;re partie, les dossiers du SAD, viennent apporter de nouvelles lumi&egrave;res sur toutes les rumeurs de la premi&egrave;re partie, au travers d'explications pour les secrets les plus importants et de tableaux pour les informations fausses ou mineures ; tableaux qui font &eacute;galement le lien avec les renseignements distill&eacute;s dans les suppl&eacute;ments pr&eacute;c&eacute;dents, afin d'&eacute;viter un travail de recherche pour les MJs.<br/>Mais de tous ces secrets, plusieurs ressortent aussit&ocirc;t du lot :<br/><br/>     La personnalit&eacute; de Karen Hall, pivot de la S&eacute;cession californienne. Est-elle r&eacute;ellement l'h&eacute;ro&iuml;ne de 2026, ou a-t-elle servi l'Union avant de la trahir au dernier moment ? Sa disparition ne fait qu'alimenter les bruits de couloir...<br/>     La personnalit&eacute; d'Andrew Noone, fondateur du COPS, tout aussi trouble que celle de Miss Hall. L&agrave; encore, pourquoi cette disparition de la sc&egrave;ne publique ?<br/>     Mais surtout, que sont r&eacute;ellement les cops ? Mutants, extra-terrestres, surhommes ? Le myst&egrave;re est enfin lev&eacute;...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Translation courtesy of Google:<br/><br/>&quot;The truth is out there&quot;, &quot;The government knows&quot;, &quot;Who keeps us from our guardians?&quot; axioms and other followers of conspiracies, that the tone of this supplement that opens the third season of the universe PSC. Rumors, urban legends, leaks, rumors and gossip corridors of all ilk - when Los Angeles California and make their own movies ... But they are wacky, some noise peddled are not less marked by truth remains to distinguish the true from the false.<br/><br/>Firstly, Conspiracy opens on notes of familiar atmosphere: the daily unit through COPS &quot;LAPD Blues&quot; (with an emphasis on the character of Douglas Collins, as nice a prison door) and the international press; rough period for leaders in California, U.S. and European blamed for various scandals respective ... Not to mention the tips to lose those extra pounds, was forced in 2032.<br/><br/>Follow folder LAPD: seven chapters by rumors involving specific topics - politics respectively, mysticism, crime, police, the city of LA, religion and technology. Each of these topics is analyzed according to several points of view: that of the world of the street, Network, television, media allowed. Naturally, all these people have a say in the matter particularly well.<br/><br/>     Politics: A review of the slides of the California Republic (starting with the mystery Karen Hall) and major national parties. Not to mention the recent scandals to date, the best-selling midges and a handful of plots. The UN, the armed wing of the Union? California Is the toy Freemasons? South Central, playground of the military?<br/>     Mysticism we will focus here on the philosophy and spirituality of Californians, as well as areas that are influenced, from food to video games. What unites the cops karmic link to their guns and masks? How to mix feng shui and dietetics? Is Los Angeles a living organism?<br/>     Crime: if the new wars of the cartels are much ink, the police would like to discover constantly denouncing its undercover agents, while some gangers seem curiously withstand bullets SWAT. Besides, who likes to shoot the gang leaders African-American? And where is the next concert Jay Buda?<br/>     Police: it appears that superheroes confused with Gotham City Los Angeles and a follower of Mad Max unleash his own justice on major roads, driving a vehicle invisible. Rest all the rumors that revolve around cops and the founder of the service, Andrew Noone, hidden nowhere. Similarly, why nobody dares to use the patroller No. 013? Curated by Duarte would it spell? What are the secret plans of Kristin Lane on the PSC?<br/>     City of LA: architecture inconsistent, fads, epidemics rats, all of which feed the wildest rumors ... There would not he any intention behind all these oddities? Remains to add to all this stuff packs shark lurking off beaches Angelinos and neo-Nazis a little bit too fan of Indiana Jones movies.<br/>     Religion: the three religions of the book are once again reviewed, in line with Gangsta Paradise and Helter Skelter , with the passage of certain secrets review - as the confrontation between the two Catholic popes, the mysteries of golem of Rabbi Yor Shevai or manipulation of the Muslim community in California. But other religious movements are not left out, whether Satanists, Hindus, Native American or New Agers. Question: should lend credence to an experience called &quot;Akira,&quot; or mere speculation?<br/>     Technology: hard to miss this area, both technological dependence of the society of the 2030s worsened. This is an opportunity to return to the small screen and ubiquity of some of its most disastrous effects on the revolution Larger Than Life on the supposed existence of autonomous IA, on the assumption of a war man / machine. Naturally, the megacorporations that benefit from this growing market can not escape the scrutiny ... Remains to finish a hot topic: the existence of extra-terrestrial life and the consequences that it has or may have.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Secondly, there is the chapter on surveys, with three in the preamble 10-18. Program: robots gone mad, nuclear alert on LA and a man fell from the sky. Two scenarios provided more follow: <br/><br/>     Alice syndrome: an old enemy resurfaces cops, when a madman likes to stack many corpses, denies that maintains good relations with its curious victims .. . with a strange surprise to the characters when the masks fall.<br/>     Californian Babe: diving in the middle of nauseating the porn industry in Van Nuys, where cops come in support of the local police. But when their colleagues believe will attract many worries, the characters will play with an ongoing investigation into the death of a policeman, the actions of the militia thugs Van Nuys detectives and the SAD - tough year balancing. And yet, help could come from an unexpected ally: nothing less than a megacorporation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The very last part, the records of SAD, come shed new light on the rumors of the first part, through explanations of the most important secrets and tables for false or minor tables are also link with information distilled in the previous supplements to avoid research work for GMs.<br/>But of all these secrets, once more emerged Lot: <br/><br/>     personality Karen Hall, pivot the Secession California. Is it really the heroine of 2026, and she served the Union before the betrayal at the last moment? His death only feeds the rumors ... <br/>     The personality of Andrew Noone, founder of the PSC also trouble than Miss Hall. Again, why this disappearance from the public scene? <br/>     But above all, really are cops? Mutants, aliens, superhumans?

The game board is compiled from 37 individual tiles, which are placed randomly and face down. The turn system is fast paced. During your turn you can carry out the following actions in any order:<br/>A. Move to any adjacent tile (1x). If hidden, the tile is revealed instantly.<br/>B. Pick up a new card from the deck corresponding to your tile (1x).<br/>C. Use cards in combinations or on their own (unlimited times).<br/><br/>There are 200 game cards divided in 5 tile types (40 each). Each zone has different possibilities of cards to find. There are 23 different game cards. Some of these cards can be used on their own, but others only in 10 specific combinations.<br/><br/>The game has different rule variations and the main game modes have somewhat opposite goals, which are: <br/>1) Survivor - the goal is to be the least hungriest when someone loses.<br/>2) Last Survivor - the goal is to stay in the game for as long as possible. So it is played till everyone but one loses.<br/>3) Forage - the goal is to be the first to reaches 20 forage points.<br/><br/>During the game-play you can place traps to protect your territory against other players or to hunt (each deck has 6 wild boar cards - which start their movement on the board). Also each deck has 3 Depleted Tile cards - which means that you cannot stay in one place all the time. The game board will get more and more depleted as the game advances. It's also possible to play long enough to have all the tiles depleted. At this point you still carry out your turns as you normally would, only there are no cards to pick up so you have to play with what you got left in your hand.<br/><br/>The expected gaming session highly varies depending on the player count, their luck/skill level and the game mode you have chosen to play with maybe including also some optional rules.<br/>For 2 players the Survivor mode can take as long as 2 hours to play out while the Forage mode can take as fast as 30 minutes. With 5+ players it's quite the opposite - the more players you got the faster the game will end in Survivor mode, while in Forage it will go on much longer.<br/><br/>"}, "131070": {"poll": [], "name": "Your Shape Fitness Evolved 2013", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Wii U edition", "North American Wii U edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Your Shape Fitness Evolved"], "videogametheme": ["Sports - Other"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Blue Byte Software GmbH (Blue Byte Studio GmbH)", "Ubisoft Montreal"], "videogamegenre": ["Fitness"], "videogameplatform": ["Wii U"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Ubisoft Entertainment S.A.
