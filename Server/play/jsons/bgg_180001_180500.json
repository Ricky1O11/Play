To achieve this, players must acquire the most victory points in the three phases of the game, using various abilities and events to gain an advantage over the other players.<br/><br/>In hopes of achieving the high honor of being named Greatest of All Mountains, each player must first form the terrain of their mountain. By adding slopes, lakes, cliffs and more to their mountain they craft the foundation of their strategy. Players may also compete to gain the all or nothing &quot;Tallest Mountain&quot; award for additional VP.<br/><br/>Next, players must build facilities on their terrain. This is where strategy becomes very important as the facilities built greatly effect how the next phase will play out. Build the best facilities on the faces of your mountain or choose to build sub-par facilities on your opponent's mountains.<br/><br/>Finally, each player must attract tourists to their mountain. The goal is to get tourists to your mountain's &quot;Safe Zone&quot; where they will be scored at the end of the game.

Or will you just go hell-for-leather from the starting line, trusting everyone else to do the dirty work?<br/><br/>Whatever you choose, that&rsquo;s only the beginning of the challenge! The course itself, weather conditions and individual moments of brilliance from riders make Attack The Pack as beautifully unforgiving as real racing. The game is for 2-4 players and lasts approx 20min.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>Each player has a team of up to five riders played in front of them, at the start of the game everyone is the peloton. Each rider has stats for four different road types (Flat Road, Hill, Moutain &amp; Cobbles) which can be changed at any time during the game. To win you need to have a rider with the highest stat number for the current road type at the end of the game, ideally in the break. Players choose to make an attack with their riders and other players can either join the attack or defend against it. The break is created by the difference in the attacking players and the defending players, which would be then counted in minutes. The riders in the break would be moved forward in front of the riders in the peloton to signify they are in the break.<br/><br/>Players then use cards to change the break, attack and join the break, or reel the break in and everyone is back in the peloton. Other cards will help and hinder riders, including changing their stats.<br/><br/>When deck runs out, then players enter the Sprint Finish, and every player gets one turn to try and change the outcome of the game and win!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "Second edition"], "age": "12", "name": "Attack The Pack", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management"], "average": "6.6", "usersrated": "15", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Bicycle / Cycling"]}, "180276": {"rpgartist": ["Pawel Dobosz", "William McAusland"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Missing Heroes", "rpgdesigner": ["Matthew Evans"], "rpgproducer": ["Matthew Evans"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2579024.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Mithgarthr Entertainment"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Drop-In Dungeons"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2579024_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Introducing Drop-In Dungeons!

Each group has a value, with the values mostly being pyramidal (1 tile = 1, 2 tiles = 3, 3 tiles = 6, etc.). In return, this opponent then takes one or more groups from you that sum at most the same value as what you stole. If it's impossible to take groups this way, that opponent can take groups that sum to a lower value or demand that you hand over groups that sum to a higher value, with you choosing which groups you give up.<br/><br/>When you collect all the tiles in a group (e.g., four blue parrots), you place those tiles face down to the side.

Fortunately, the glorious leader had a council of wise and creative advisers who would help him to understand various things about these circumstances. Some advisers would provide examples of the circumstances; other advisers would explain the cause of the circumstances, and others still would offer solutions to the different circumstances. Prepare yourself for such trials and tribulations, for you will have to be creative and clever if you wish to be declared the best adviser ever!<br/><br/>Game Contents <br/>170 picture cards <br/> 30 circumstance cards<br/><br/>Objective: <br/>Each round, one player will judge the advice offered by the other players and decide whose advice was the best. The player whose advice is chosen the most by the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>Game Setup <br/>1. First decide which game you will be using (i.e. game A, B, or C). <br/>2. Divide the cards into one stack of circumstance cards and one or more stack(s) of picture cards.<br/>3. Each player draws 10 picture cards to form his or her playing hand. Players are allowed to look through their hand, but should keep their cards hidden from the prying eyes of the other advisers.<br/>4. The player who is closest to the age of 18 becomes the first judge.<br/><br/>Turn Sequence <br/>1. The judge flips over a circumstance card and reads aloud the circumstance for the appropriate game (e.g. &ldquo;Our Glorious Leader demands that his laundry be softer.&rdquo;) <br/>2. Each of the other advisers plays one picture card from his or her hand and explains how it relates to the circumstance. (e.g. &ldquo;We shall use this mighty chainsaw to inspire the imperial clothes washers into improving their job performance.&rdquo;) <br/>3. The judge selects the card/explanation that he or she likes the best. <br/>4. The winning adviser keeps that circumstance card as a victory point. <br/>5. The picture cards that were just played are discarded and players draw back up to a hand of 10 picture cards (Note: circumstance cards do count against the hand limit and do not need to be held.) If the deck of picture cards runs out, discarded cards can be reshuffled to form a new deck.<br/>6. The adviser to the left of the judge becomes the new judge, draws a new circumstance card, reads it aloud, and so on and so forth. <br/>7. The game ends after the last circumstance is resolved. The player with the most victory points is declared the best adviser ever! (All of the loser advisors should then sing a song commemorating the greatness of the winning advisor.)<br/><br/>Game Play Variations <br/>Suggestion Box: Players place their cards face down in front of the judge. After all players have done so, the Judge shuffles them, reveals them, and decides which of them is the winner without any further input from the advisers. This style prevents people from playing favorites.<br/><br/>Bards against Humanity: Incorporate the picture cards into your other party style games to allow for more flexibility in play.<br/><br/>Become Famous: Post your own variants on the Pics &amp; Circumstance website under the Officially Unofficial Variants section.<br/><br/>For More Information<br/>Please visit us at Facebook.com/PicsAndCircumstance<br/> &copy; Copyright 2015 Tom &amp; Pete Games, LLC all rights reserved.<br/><br/>"}, "180294": {"poll": [], "name": "Chopstick Expert", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Fancy & Toy"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A 1 ~ 2 player game to practice using chopsticks.<br/><br/>The game comes with <br/>2 pairs of chopsticks <br/>1 small bowl<br/>4 sprues of 6 &quot;beans&quot; in two colors (there are 4 shapes)<br/><br/>The instructions provide two ways to play 1) Compete against an opponent to be the first to put all of your color &quot;beans&quot; to the bowl. 2) Time Attack (solo) - challenge to transfer all of the beans to the bowl<br/><br/>"}, "180295": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Chip Beauvais"], "average": "5.99828", "poll": [], "name": "Smoke & Mirrors", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "3", "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "29", "boardgamefamily": ["Button Shy Wallet Games"], "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2594989_t.png", "boardgameartist": ["Sara Beauvais", "Fabrice Weiss"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Button Shy"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2594989.png", "boardgameversion": ["Wallet Edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "A bluffing game for 3-5 players.

The tororu, by contrast, can rend foes asunder with its deadly frenzied strike, and in times of dire need, can call upon its regeneration burst to increase its healing power immensely for a short time. Finally, the waste yai spreads a particularly virulent and deadly disease that causes its victims to rise as zombies, can control vermin, and has a nasty debilitating gut strike.<br/><br/>Whether you want to round out your cast of oni for an oriental-themed campaign, or are just looking for new and exciting takes on some classic giants, you'll find what you're looking for in these unusual oni.<br/><br/>"}, "180345": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2590220.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Alberto Barbieri", "Luigi Cornaglia"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Luigi Berio", "Paolo Vallerga"], "boardgamepublisher": ["A.P.S.

Each player has an identical set of eight cards, each of them with a special effect.<br/><br/>At the beginning of a round, the common supply on the board becomes more attractive by adding seals (victory points) and wares and by improving the ratio to change wares into seals.

For example, a fleet gets you three wares, but the ship gets you all the remaining ones. If there are ten wares and one opponent played a fleet, you get the seven remaining wares after he has taken three. If three other players play a fleet and take three wares each, you gain only one for your ship. How effective your card is depends on what the other players do &mdash; but you cannot be sure of what they'll do because all decisions are made simultaneously.

Staff officers from all three fleets prepared detailed operational plans, yet when war came in August 1914 Italy refused to join her Alliance partners and those plans would never be used.<br/><br/>The joint staffs foresaw an aggressive Triple Alliance, one attemtping to seize control of the Mediterranean from the British and French. Our book Triple Alliance looked at the first year of such a naval war in a set of 43 new scenarios for our Great War at Sea: Mediterranean boxed game.<br/><br/>Central Powers picks up that story in September 1915, with Italy, Austria-Hungary and Germany still struggling against Britain and France as new warships join the fleets of both sides. The fleets are almost evenly matched, with a slight Allied superiority in numbers matched by the Central Powers' central position. In this war, the fighting on the Mediterranean Sea has been just as bloody and destructive as that on the land fronts.<br/><br/>Central Powers is a book supplement for the Great War at Sea series based on this naval war that never happened, but was probably more likely to have occurred than the actual events. It is not a complete game; ownership of our Mediterranean and Jutland boxed games and Triple Alliance, Dreadnoughts and Zeppelins supplements is required to enjoy all of the scenarios.<br/><br/>The book includes 90 new playing pieces. The French receive their powerful Normandie- and Lyons-class super-dreadnoughts, and a pair of battle cruisers as well. And there's a quartet of French light cruisers proposed before the war but never built, that would have been very useful in fleet actions.<br/><br/>With the Royal Navy unwilling to detach too much strength from the Grand Fleet facing the Germans across the North Sea, it falls on the other Allies to bolster this very active naval front. The Americans enter the Mediterranean naval war with their oldest dreadnoughts and newest pre-dreadnoughts, plus a large squadron of the armored cruisers. The Japanese are present as well with a squadron of battleships and one of cruisers. Plus there are four re-armed Austrian light cruisers (there have to be Austrians) and an Italian seaplane carrier (with seaplanes).<br/><br/>The forty-two (42) scenarios continue the Triple Alliance story line through to the end of the Great War; since the book shares the special rules of Triple Alliance, we have more room for the story!

Each turn, you play a series of cards in the dungeon area. The turn represents an encounter as you explore the vast and sprawling dungeon. Layer the cards in a column while the turn is active. When the turn is over, stack those cards face down before moving on to the next turn.

Therefore, at the beginning of the game all 25 buildings are laid out on the table, ready to be torn down and blown up. Of course, this work is not done by itself but you need trustworthy workers like Slobodan, Leonid or Hao Wech. During each game round each player buys one of these at an auction, and thus equipped with the required devices they can demolish a building, provided the following conditions are met: the player is able to get rid of the construction waste (legally or illegally &ndash; the main point is: away with it!) and there are sufficient vacant spaces next to the building. Of course the nuclear power plant in the heart of the city is harder to break into pieces than the hot-dog stand just next to the city limits sign. This edition introduces the bureaucrats. They can be useful with their special permits if once and again there is not enough space to demolish a building. A successful demolition results in a demolition award for the player and they keep the tile for scoring at the end of the game. Who would not like to blow the revenue office to pieces and thus earn a little tax refund? That way the buildings vanish one after the other until there are only 2 or less left standing. The player who has demolished the most valuable buildings is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>Abriss takes about 45 minutes to play, the game mechanism is easy to understand and there is little downtime. The auction of subcontractors and bureaucrats provides interaction and is kept simple - there are only 3 possible bids. With the random set-up, each game offers a new challenge for the players.<br/><br/>The new edition includes bureaucrats and the expansion ABRISS-AUFTR&Auml;GE/DEMOLITION-CONTRACTS.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["ABRISS (2.Edition) 2015"], "average": "8", "name": "Abriss (Zweite Edition)", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Hand Management"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "180398": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Wesly Gibs"], "average": "6", "poll": [], "name": "Horen Zien Zwijgen", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Acting", "Paper-and-Pencil", "Pattern Recognition", "Rock-Paper-Scissors", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2740620_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Wesly Gibs"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["University Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2740620.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch first edition", "French first edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Party Game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Partygame where people have to guess and score point in several categories:<br/><br/>(no) Hear:<br/>- Sign language<br/>- Draw on ones back<br/><br/>(no) See:<br/>- Blind drawing<br/>- Braille<br/><br/>(no) Talk:<br/>- Gestures<br/>- Say 'uh'<br/><br/>"}, "180399": {"rpgartist": ["David Esbri", "Jaume Fabregat", "Chema Pamundi"], "rpg": ["Fanhunter"], "statistics": [], "name": "La Gu\u00eda de BNC (Barnacity)", "rpgdesigner": ["Chema Pamundi"], "rpgproducer": ["Chema Pamundi", "Ver\u00f3nica Ram\u00edrez"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2582011.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["First printing"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Comedy / Satire", "Fantasy (Modern Urban Fantasy)", "Modern (Near Future)", "Science Fiction (Cyberpunk)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Farsa's Wagon"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2582011_t.jpg", "description": "De la contra portada:<br/>E esta estupenda gu&iacute;a de Barnacity encontrar&aacute;s todo lo que siempre quisiste saber, e incluso lo que siempre te la trajo floja acerca de la capital del reino de Dick y de cualquier otra gran ciudad en general del universo Fanhunter.<br/><br/>"}, "180400": {"rpgartist": ["Jaume Fabregat", "Chema Pamundi"], "rpg": ["Fanhunter"], "statistics": [], "name": "BNC Tales", "rpgdesigner": ["Chema Pamundi"], "rpgproducer": ["Ver\u00f3nica Ram\u00edrez"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2582012.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["First printing"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Comedy / Satire", "Fantasy (Modern Urban Fantasy)", "Modern (Near Future)", "Science Fiction (Cyberpunk)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Farsa's Wagon"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2582012_t.jpg", "description": "De la portada:<br/>Cachondas aventuras en la capital del reino de Dick para Fanhunter.<br/><br/>"}, "180401": {"rpgartist": ["David Esbri", "Chema Pamundi"], "rpg": ["Fanhunter"], "poll": [], "name": "Fanhunter's Spanish Show (1\u00aa Parte)", "rpgdesigner": ["Chema Pamundi"], "rpgproducer": ["Ver\u00f3nica Ram\u00edrez"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2582013.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["First printing"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Comedy / Satire", "Fantasy (Modern Urban Fantasy)", "Modern (Near Future)", "Science Fiction (Cyberpunk)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Farsa's Wagon"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Fanhunter's Spanish Show"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2582013_t.jpg", "description": "De la portada:<br/>La resistencia, en otro arrebato de estulticia, ha decidido resucitar a Krad el Zurdo, el peor jugador de Magik de la historia.

The present emperor is Trajan; one of Rome's greatest generals, leading Rome's greatest military expansion. He has ruled for two glorious years. The senate is largely perfunctory, but those in power still seek the Emperor's ear in order to push their own agendas. This game is about trying to gain Trajan's favor and rule Rome from the shadows.<br/><br/>In 100 A.D. players are members of a secret cabal attempting to control the Senate from behind the scenes. By manipulating the system, passing Bills that improve their status, and gaining influence over the city's factions, the players gain control over various aspects of Rome. Victory points are earned by having influence over the Senate, factions, Senators, and Emperor's Favor. At the end of the game, the player with the most extensive power structure (i.e. victory points) wins.<br/><br/>Throughout the game players take various actions to impact three different portions of the game board in order to accumulate victory points. Players can control the Emperor's Favor, the Senate, or the various factions of the game (or some combination thereof). Players also need to manage their corruption, as too much will lose them points. Generally, players have only one action per turn, but various cards and tokens can be used to gain additional actions.<br/><br/>Each round starts with the Orator, who advances the round token one space and takes an action. During a player's turn, he or she takes one action play then passes clockwise. The actions a player can take on their turn are: Call in a Favor (by playing a faction card); Contact a Faction (by placing influence tokens on a faction space and drawing the appropriate card); Control a Senator (by buying their seat); Remove Influence (withdrawing influence tokens from factions); or Subterfuge (a special action that can vary depending on the circumstances).<br/><br/>When all players have taken a turn, the round is over. At three different times during the game (after rounds 5, 10, and 15) Recess is called and victory points are tallied. Recess is also where players adjust their faction points, and vote on Bills.

The law-abiding citizens of mid-western Hometown, USA need you!<br/><br/>Super villains from nearby Colossal City have come to expand their criminal enterprises. Their minions are wreaking havoc on this once peaceful town, and someone must rise up to challenge the masked mayhem.<br/><br/>You are the only people capable of thwarting these diabolical criminals. Though you are but a handful of courageous citizens, you possess unique powers and abilities that give Hometown its best hope for salvation. You are the Hometown Heroes!<br/><br/>OVERVIEW<br/><br/>Hometown Heroes is a Superhero-themed card game by Roger Alan Cotton for two players, ages 11 to adult. Play Time ranges from 30 to 90 minutes, depending on how many episodes are played. The starter version of the game comes with seven Comic Book Issues, made up of twenty-one episodes. Expansions will introduce new comic book issues, episodes, and characters.<br/><br/>GAME CONCEPT<br/><br/>Players play out a &quot;comic book issue,&quot; which is comprised of three Episodes. Each episode lists objectives worth different amounts of Victory Points. The player whose team of superheroes or super villains completes objectives worth the highest number of Victory Points by the end of the comic book issue, wins.<br/><br/>GAME SET UP<br/><br/>1. Decide who will play the Heroes team and who will play the Villains team. The Villains Player always starts the game as the Active Player, with the Heroes Player starting as the Reacting Player. After the first turn, the players switch statuses. This continues until the end of the game.<br/><br/>2. Decide which Comic Book Issue you will be playing. Place this Issue Card off to the side on the play area.<br/><br/>3. Each player receives the Comic Book Issue Card's three corresponding Episode Cards. Episode cards are double-sided; with one side listing the Heroes Player's objectives, and the other side listing the Villains Player's objectives.<br/><br/>4. The Heroes Player selects five heroes to be in his super team, while the Villains Player selects seven villains and henchmen. These characters are represented by Hero / Villain Cards (which are placed face-up in front of their respective players, on the game play area).<br/><br/>6. Place all (9) of your selected characters' corresponding Action Cards into your Actions Decks, along with the (9) base Action Cards that correspond with your alignments.  Then, shuffle the decks. These decks are made up of Actions Cards that represent attacks, defenses, maneuvers, and general actions (like Lifting and Tracking) performed by specific characters in play.<br/><br/>GAME TURN SEQUENCE<br/><br/>1. Hand Formation / Action Card Draw<br/>2. Initiative Determination<br/>3. Action Resolution<br/>4. Episode Completion<br/><br/>HAND FORMATION / ACTION CARD DRAW Phase<br/><br/>At start of game, draw (5) cards from your Action Deck to form your Hand.<br/><br/>At the start of each of your successive turns, draw only enough cards to refill your Hand back up to (5) cards.<br/><br/>INITIATIVE DETERMINATION Phase<br/><br/>Regardless of whose turn it is, the Action Card in either of your Hands with the highest Initiative Value gets to go first. If there are one or more Action Cards with equal Initiative Values, the Active Player's actions are resolved first. Initiative then continues to the character in either Hand with the next fastest Initiative Value.<br/><br/>ACTION RESOLUTION Phase<br/><br/>All actions have an Initiative Value ranging from 1 to 10. An action with an Initiative Value of 10 is the fastest action, while actions with an Initiative Value of 1 are the slowest.<br/><br/>The Active Player starts the action by asking if the Reacting Player has any Action Cards in his Hand that have an Initiative Value of 10. If not, the Active Player may play as many Initiative-10 actions from his Hand as he wishes (depending on availability).<br/><br/>Unless the Reacting Player can prevent the Active Player's cards from taking effect, these actions are resolved and can be used to attack enemy characters, or to complete the objectives on the current Episode Card.<br/><br/>Note: If both players have actions with the same Initiative Values, the Active Player's actions always get resolved before the Reacting Player's actions.<br/><br/>Once the Active Player has played all of the cards in his Hand that he can play, his turn ends. The Reacting Player cannot play any further cards until the start of his own turn.<br/><br/>SCORING<br/><br/>As your characters complete Episode Card objectives, you gain Victory Point Counters equal to the objectives' VP Values. As you gain these counters, keep them on the game play area, next to your characters.<br/><br/>You also gain (1) Victory Point for every enemy character that is Knocked Out at the end of the game, as well as (3) Victory Points for every enemy character you have captured.<br/><br/>"}, "180429": {"poll": [], "name": "Fortune's Tavern - The Fantasy Tavern Simulator", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "description": "Every great RPG has its tavern: where heroes meet, rumours are told, quests are undertaken, and beer is supped by the gallon&hellip; but could you manage such a place?<br/><br/>Jump into the role of a fantasy-world tavern keeper: where you will need to renovate an ailing tavern, chat to hundreds of unique guests, manage a stables full of magical creatures, oversee the battle pit, hire heroes or villains to help hunt down magical tavern items like the Mythril Spork of Fortune, and try to keep the drunken guests from trashing the place.<br/><br/>Even at the best of times running such a tavern is not an easy task, but these are not the best of times.

There are those who love challenging the impossible, slaying dragons and demons alike while bringing back exotic trophies of their slaughtered foes. Others work to overthrow oppression, rarely abiding a tyrant in their lands.<br/><br/>Most chi warriors feel right at home with barbarians and rogues, finding a great deal in common through their travels. A bard and a chi warrior can have a friendship that is as legendary as their accomplishments, each complimenting the other. Chi warriors are often at odds with monks and lawful divine characters, their rigid codes rub the more free spirited chi warrior the wrong way.<br/><br/>Chi warriors generally pay little attention to the gods, seeing them more as inspiring idols than objects of veneration. Terrestrial affairs concern them far more, chi warriors sometimes keep a journal to chronicle honorable opponents and glory won in battle.<br/><br/>Vain and prideful, chi warriors can be reckless in battle, proving a touch too wild for allies. But rarely will they go as far as to put their comrades in danger, preferring to face the most dangerous challenges themselves. Drawn to trouble like moths to a flame, chi warriors are rarely wanting for combat, finding the experience invigorating as they use their opponent as a canvas for their artistic expression. As long as chi warriors can walk, they can fight, often pushing the body to the breaking point and beyond.<br/><br/>The Chi Warrior is a new full-BAB base class for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.<br/><br/>"}, "180434": {"rpgdesigner": ["L.

As you know, what we know today as The Black Death was actually the largest zombie plague of our times. The Vatican fought the threat with Crusaders and Inquisitors took care to hide what had happened. When, in 1666, the City of London was occupied by 100,000 zombies, the Crusaders did not appear. The terrified country's leaders then decided to create the Royal Deadhunter Force. For centuries, the Royal Deadhunter Force has been the largest and most powerful striking force against the zombie threat, though, in recent years, our ranks have been decimated and, mysteriously, the zombies pests have increased excessively. &quot;<br/>&quot;Something strange is happening, and only the Vatican has the answers.

This article provides a quick overview of how psionics works and presents a new class &mdash; the mystic. Similar to how the cleric represents a wide variety of divine magic users, the mystic encapsulates a variety of characters who wield psionic power.<br/><br/>Using the options presented in this article, you can play a mystic to 5th level, following one of two psionic orders and training in that order&rsquo;s unique disciplines. Following the Order of the Awakened allows you to create a mystic who manipulates the minds and awareness of other creatures, and who can tap into unseen psionic power both in and out of combat. Following the Order of the Immortal allows you to create a mystic who focuses psionic power in combat, similar to the battlemind or psychic warrior of previous editions. Other options for the mystic will appear as the playtest progresses and we gain valuable feedback about the class's mechanics in play.<br/><br/>As usual, you can expect a survey asking for feedback on these draft rules in about a month or so. At this point, we&rsquo;re not necessarily tied to any of these options. This effort is merely a first draft to gauge where we should start and what kind of approach to psionics in fifth edition will work best.<br/><br/>"}, "180457": {"rpgartist": ["Jesus Martinez del Vals (JMV)"], "rpgitemversion": ["Primera Edici\u00f3n"], "statistics": [], "name": "El Rol de los Idiotas", "rpgdesigner": ["Jos\u00e9 A.

Your primary goal is to manipulate your neighbors to finish based on your secret objective.  Vegetable Race is played over multiple rounds and is anyone's game until the final round.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/>Each player selects a vegetable from the eight available (Carrot, Tomato, Bean, Pepper, Eggplant, Onion, Corn, and Lettuce) and takes the appropriate vegetable card and player pieces.<br/>At the start of each race, each player is given a secret objective and dealt 2 playing cards.  The secret objectives relate to yourself or your neighbors finishing, i.e.: &quot;Finish any time after the person to your right. 3 pts&quot;, or &quot;Finish Last. 4 pts.&quot;<br/><br/>On a players turn they draw a card then play a card.  Or, they can use their vegetables ability.  Cards move themselves or other players.  Cards also allow you to play from another players hand, swap places, and more.  <br/>There is a single &quot;Finish First&quot; card that gives a player 7 points if they finish first with it in their hand and causes their opponents to lose 1 point.<br/><br/>Points for finishing in each race are awarded as follows: <br/>First: 0pts<br/>Second: 4pts<br/>Last: 3pts<br/>Other: 2pts<br/><br/>So, in the span of each race, you go from not wanting to finish, wanting to finish, then not wanting to finish again.<br/><br/>The race is run on a 10 space racetrack.  After all players have finished, points are tallied on a separate score track.  Play continues until a predetermined score has been met (20 or 30 points) or number of races have been run (3 is usually a good number to determine the top vegetable).  Each race runs 5-10 minutes, more or less depending on the number of players.<br/><br/>When playing with 6-8 players additional rules and objectives are added to help speed the game along.<br/><br/>Vegetable Race Consists of: (subject to change prior to release)<br/>54 Standard poker sized playing cards (10 Secret Objective, 42 playing cards, 2 rules quick reference cards)<br/>10 Large playing cards (8 Vegetable Player cards, Race Track, and Score track)<br/>18 Molded plastic pieces (2 of each Vegetable and two additional pieces for tracking starting player with 6-8 players)<br/><br/>The vegetables used in Vegetable Race are vegetables in the culinary sense.  The designer is aware that some vegetables used are botanically fruits.

Each turn players take one of four possible actions:  1) roll a custom die and move to take a new card, 2) secure a set of treasures or add to an existing set to score points, 3) affect the dragon, who wakes in stages from his tail to his head, by playing cards that soothe or rouse him, or 4) use a sword on an opponent or capture a used sword with a shield. The board is composed of 12 facedown cards surrounding the dragon.  It changes as players remove and replace the cards. Dice rolls between 1-5 enable clockwise or counterclockwise movement and the special symbol allows access to all but one of the cards, so it is a game that rewards memory.<br/><br/>Hoard is meant to be played in rounds, with scoring tokens obviating the need for pencil and paper scorekeeping.<br/><br/>A limited run of Hoard was self-published by Tim Kings-Lynne and Beck Veitch in 2014. They entered into an agreement with Cheeky Parrot Games in order to improve the game play and get Hoard re-published and more widely distributed.

Work hard. Learn to control the elements. Study each recipe and combination, no matter how impossible they may seem. Face your worst fears. And trust fortune as well because it's wise to admit that not everything is in your hands. That's the only true way to become an alchemist.<br/><br/>In each turn of Los Aprendices, players throw all their dice at the same time to get resources. With these resources, they place their tokens in one or more of the six boards on the table, and on these boards they can get abilities or knowledge (depending on the area the player wants to develop). The game is all about gaining resources, using the abilities to transform them into other resources (or multiply them), and rising in the different boards to gain as much knowledge as possible. When a player has more than 42 victory points, that triggers the last round, then whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>Your knowledge and intelligence will be the key to your becoming the next alchemist!<br/><br/><br/>Ahora sois aprendices y os queda un largo camino por delante.

In Les Petits Pirates, players are pirates, working to gather resources and gold while trying to prevent their opponents from doing the same.  Through action selection and dice manipulation, players will plunder, attack, and sail the seas in their quest to bury enough treasure and enjoy a decadent pirate retirement!<br/><br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>Les Petits Pirates is an easy game to expand for more players or larger games.  A single 5.5&rdquo; x 8.5&rdquo; game board can support 2-4 players with 3 ships each.  Multiple game boards can be combined, or a larger board used to easily expand the game for 5-6 players.  Special rules and map also allow for solo play.  More variety can be easily introduced by simply printing new maps that can be used alone or combined with other maps.  The game can easily be re-themed for a variety of genres, like Vikings, Space, High Fantasy, etc.  Les Petits Pirates can easily be played with just the game board and typical household items, like dice and coins, but the game lends itself to having a &lsquo;deluxe&rsquo; edition that includes nicer components.<br/><br/><br/>Overview:<br/><br/>Les Petits Pirates is played in two phases per round.  In the first phase all players roll Action dice for their pirate ships and then place them in turn order.  In the second phase each Action die is resolved from the lowest to the highest.  This means that the player order for the second phase changes every round.  Each die provides a choice of Actions, from attacking other pirates to plundering ports to burying gold.  However, players are able to manipulate their dice by spending gold and resources to take their desired action.  The first player to successfully bury twenty gold coins is the winner.<br/><br/><br/>Accolades:<br/><br/>Les Petits Pirates has been tested at Protospiel and other game design meetups.  Les Petits Pirates won 2nd place in the 2015 MicroGame Print and Play Contest on Board Game Geek.  Les Petits Pirates was a finalist in the KBG Design Contest.<br/><br/><br/>Print &amp; Play:<br/><br/>Print &amp; Play files are available in the Web Links section at the official page (at <a target='_blank' href='http://georgejaros.com/LPP' rel='nofollow'>http://georgejaros.com/LPP</a> )<br/><br/>"}, "180491": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Colm Lundberg"], "poll": [], "name": "Love 2 Hate: A Party Game for Inappropriate People", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "3", "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "12", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2594334_t.png", "average": "6.125", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Green Ronin Publishing"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2594334.png", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Party Game"], "age": "14", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Love 2 Hate is the card game of finishing sentences (and laughing at the result!).

Funding for the game was raised via a successful Kickstarter campaign and the game was released on January 19, 2015. HuniePop is available in two different versions, an uncensored version available via Humble Bundle and MangaGamer, and a censored version via Steam. The game follows the dating adventures of the main character as they try to woo several different women in their home town.<br/><br/>Gameplay focuses on the player (who can be male or female) interacting with several different women, each of whom has her own distinct personalities and preferences. The player can interact with women by talking to them and giving them gifts. Doing this rewards the player with &quot;Hunie&quot; an in-game currency that can be used to upgrade the player's stats. These stats allow the player to earn more points during dates, increasing their chance of success.<br/><br/>In order to progress through the game, players must take the women on dates, where they will play a tile matching game where they must make matches of 3 or more of the same tokens. The player must earn enough points to complete the date before they run out of moves. Each woman has specific type of token that they like and dislike, and players will gain more points if they match the type of token that woman prefers. The player can also use special items called &quot;date gifts&quot; during their dates which grant positive effects to help the player earn more points. After a successful date, the player is rewarded with a picture of the woman the date was with. Each successful date will also raise the game's difficulty, making subsequent dates require more points to complete. After 3 successful dates with a woman, the play will be able to take them on a date at night, and if that date is successful, the player can bring the woman to their bedroom for one final round of tile matching. Unlike regular dates, the player will have unlimited moves to complete the bedroom game, but the score meter constantly drains over time, so to win, the player must make matches quickly until the meter is full.<br/><br/>Throughout the game the player is guided by Kyu, a love fairy set on turning the player into a successful Lothario. She gives the player tips on how to interact with each woman, and explains how the game's various mechanics work.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;HuniePop&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "180008": {"poll": [], "name": "Sheriff of Nottingham: Gambler's Risk", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Role Playing", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "2014", "boardgameexpansion": ["Sheriff of Nottingham"], "usersrated": "37", "boardgamefamily": ["Cities: Nottingham", "Dice Tower Essentials"], "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2575672_t.png", "average": "7.67936", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Arcane Wonders"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2575672.png", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Humor", "Medieval", "Novel-based", "Party Game"], "age": "13", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This pack of promo cards contains one card in each player color.

This allows them to customize the length of their game.<br/><br/>You then flip the fist item card over and see how many kid team points you need to have to try to get the item back.<br/><br/>Each player starts with two cards from the Action/Kid deck. This deck contains kids from the neighborhood worth 1-5 points each that you add to your hand to try to build up a team with enough points to retrieve the item. There are also four other types of cards that cause things, do things, and help protect you from the creepy things that can happen in the house:<br/><br/><br/>     Chaos cards always go off when drawn. Chaos she is a harsh mistress.<br/>     Protection cards are used to prevent or deflect many of the negative events and actions in the game.<br/>     Incident cards can be played on other players during your action phase to try to disrupt their chances of acquiring the item.<br/>     Trap cards always go off when drawn, with the house apparently trying to defend its ill-gotten gains.

If it doesn't instruct you to play it immediately (traps and chaos cards), then you can put it in your hand. You then have the option to perform an action. If you have a card that is playable (Incident and some Chaos), you can play this on the other players to help yourself or hurt their chances to win.<br/><br/>Turns proceed around the play area until someone has at least as many points in their hand as shown as the target number on the item. Once that minimum is met, they can choose to fold their hand and place it face down.

Each player starts the game with the same library, 7 Strengths and 3 Fears.  Players shuffle the library and deal themselves 5 cards.  Each Strength is worth 1 power.  Fears are worth nothing.  The opening hand can have from 2 to 5 points of power.  The main deck of cards is then dealt 5 cards out to the Storyboard.  If any events happen, do what the card says, otherwise, check for card's with surprise effects (which usually add to your insanity).  Now the first player takes their turn. They can use their hand of cards to buy items from the storyboard based on their cost (and, in the case of Horrors, the insanity level to banish them).  Non-horror cards are placed in that player's graveyard, Horror cards are banished to the banished stack.  At the end of the turn, the player draws their five cards again, if the library lacks sufficient cards, shuffle the graveyard back in to the library and complete the rest of the five card draw.  The play is passed on to the next player, who then refills the storyboard from the main deck of any cards that were purchased or banished by the prior player.  Resolves and event and surprise effects and then their turn starts.<br/><br/>Insanity rules - In the game, it is very important to track just how insane you are!  Everyone starts out totally normal - with zero insanity - event, surprise effects and using certain arcane or artifacts will increase or decrease your insanity.  If you reach 13 insanity, you have crossed over and succumbed to insanity.  At this point, the only way to reduce your insanity is playing cards that reduce your insanity or discarding cards to reduce your insanity by the Victory Point value of the card.  You'll need to do this as soon as possible because if your reach 20, you've completely lost your mind and are a vassal for the Ancient Ones (or, in game terms, you just lost and are out of the game).<br/><br/>Ancient Ones - Before the game is started, you separate the Ancient Ones, Azathoth, Hastur and Cthulhu are shuffled and put on the bottom of the stack.  Yig is taken out and the rest are shuffled and put on top of the stack.  Then Yig is placed face up on the stack.  While the Ancient Ones are face up on the stack, they have an effect, called The Haunting - which impacts the game.  Yig, for example, cost 8 points to defeat, however, his haunting effect is that, for each two banished Horrors, Yig costs 1 more point to defeat.  If three Horrors are banished, Yig would cost 9 points to defeat.  When a new ancient one is revealed from the stack, which happens after one has been defeated, they have a one time &quot;awakening&quot; attack - this is an effect that happens immediately when they are turned face up and the attack is against each player.  If the player has a defense, they can defend against the attack - if allowed. For example, Ithaqua's Awakening Attack is that each player puts all Allies from their graveyard back in to the story.<br/><br/>Psychic Blast - These cards are put in a stack outside of the main deck or the Ancient One's.  They cost three points and can be purchased at anytime during your turn.  Sometimes the storyboard will contain cards you don't want or can't buy and you can always buy a Psychic Blast if you would like.  When a Psychic Blast is destroyed, it is placed in the destroyed pile.  If the stack is empty, no more Psychic blasts can be purchased.<br/><br/>Corruption - These cards are put in a stack outside of the main deck or the Ancient One's. Card effects that say you gain a corruption are from this stack of cards.  Corruptions are have a -1 victory point, which, costs you points at the end of the game if they are in your library.  When a Corruption is destroyed, it is returned to the corruption stack.  If the corruption stack is empty, no more corruptions can be handed out to players.<br/><br/>Investigators - Each player represents an investigator, a Gangster, Law Enforcement, Nun, Priest, Private Investigator, Professor or Psychic.  Each investigator has a special ability that allows them to do their special thing during their turns.  The Psychic's ability allow that player - at the beginning of their turn, to look at the top two cards of their deck and then put one of those cards in the graveyard.  Most of the time, this will help the player select the best of the two cards, possibly discarding a card they would rather not draw, sometimes both cards would work very well, but they still have to discard one.   Other abilities affect the cards drawn, power of cards, the storyboard and so on.<br/><br/>"}, "180087": {"rpgdesigner": ["Monte Cook", "Shanna Germain", "Anthony Pastores", "Alina Pete"], "rpgitemversion": ["Free PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Ohunkakan: The Living Myths", "rpgartist": ["Winona Nelson", "Bear Weiter"], "rpgproducer": ["Scott C.

The debate centered around how much horse cavalry to keep mixed in with the tanks, trucks and other combat vehicles. The idea was the large mass of unmotorized units would form a &quot;base of maneuver&quot; from which the relatively more scarce -- but elite -- moto-mech units would operate.<br/><br/>Of course, by the war's midpoint all that had been settled. The question had come to center on determining the optimal mix of tracked and wheeled vehicles, etc.<br/><br/>Today, we're witnessing a similar transformation in that the former moto-mech elite has, in effect, taken on the role of the previous era's foot-sloggers and horse cavalry: they're now the new &quot;base of maneuver&quot; element, holding the line while, evolving atop and past them, is the new elite: the special forces, which are themselves increasingly robot-equipped.<br/><br/>Given that the cost and social advantages involved in deploying small elites rather than the mass mechanized armies of the previous era (the draft isn't going to come back), I see us now at about the 1938-equivalent in terms of the new transition.<br/><br/>Aside from that, another characteristic is more and more of the First World's armies combat experience is increasingly contained within the personnel of the SoF. That, of course, further enhances their relative combat power.<br/><br/>To smoothly model all that, I've come up a system I've titled the &quot;Big And Dumb Armies Super System&quot; (BADASS).
