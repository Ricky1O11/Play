The object is to get all your plane pieces into the base of your color in the center of the map.<br/><br/>Each player has 4 planes in their starting base. Each turn you roll the die and move one plane of your color on the board.  To get your planes out of your base and onto the board you must roll a 6.  You get an extra turn whenever you roll a 6. If your plane happens to end up on top of another person's plane, that person's plane must go back to their base until he or she rolls a 6 again to get it out onto the board.<br/><br/>On the board there are colored spaces that coincide with each player. If you land on your own color, you can immediately jump to the next block of your color.  There are also certain colored squares that offer shortcuts across the board.  You may only use the shortcuts that coincide with your color.  If you land on a colored square and subsequently jump to a shortcut square, you may also take the shortcut (essentially jumping twice in one turn).  If you ever land on your own piece, you may &quot;stack&quot; the pieces and move them as one piece until they reach the center or are landed on by an opponent and sent back as individuals.<br/><br/>The first player to get all of their planes to the center of the board wins, and the rest play until there is only 1 loser.

At the end of each player's turn, the total number of tiles placed correctly on the board are counted and recorded on the unique score sheet. Kids can play as many rounds as they want and best of all the game cannot be mastered since each turn presents a completely new challenge.

At the end of each race, players acquire sponsors based on their performance, and have the opportunity to spend money to purchase upgrades to their bikes for future heats.

Using an original card-driven system, it provides strong historical flavor in a simple game that can consistently be played in three hours. This makes The Price of Freedom an ideal game for today's gamer's busy lifestyle, as well as for tournaments.<br/><br/>As you might expect from a quick-playing game, counter density in The Price of Freedom is purposefully low and is also constrained by each side&rsquo;s War Effort level, an aggregate measure of economic, political and diplomatic support for the war. Each military game piece represents a &quot;corps&quot; of 20-30,000 men. Corps must organized into armies led by the colorful commanders that every American Civil War aficionado has come to love or hate. Twenty-five historical army commanders are available for theater or field command, from Ben &quot;Spoons&quot; Butler to &quot;Massa&quot; Robert E. Lee, with each commander rated -1, 0 or +1 for offense, defense and movement.  Armies move and fight on a functional and yet very attractive point-to-point representation of the Eastern and Western theaters, vying to capture or defend critical territory or simply to beat each other out.<br/><br/>The card-driven engine ensures that no game of The Price of Freedom is ever the same as another and that there are plenty of hard choices to make in each campaign impulse. The game uses a well-balanced deck of 55 cards that are all playable by both sides. Each card has two uses that are generally mutually exclusive: either it can be used by spending its operational value (ranging 1-3) on various actions (moving, reorganizing or reinforcing armies) or it can be used to implement the event described on the card. Events can affect army leadership (Commander-in-Chief, Clash of Egos, Shot from the Saddle) or battle resolution (Blundering Fool; Seeing the Elephant; Bickering Generals; etc.), help gain operational advantage (Strategic Transfer; Turning Movement; Interior Lines), or simulate major political, economic or diplomatic events (Draft; Kentucky; Blockade; etc.). Like overall army size, hand size is dictated by each side's War Effort level.<br/><br/>The Union player can win by driving down the Confederate War Effort level low enough or by vastly outnumbering Confederate troops. The Confederate player can win in similar fashion or by hanging long and well enough to cause Lincoln to lose the 1864 elections or prevent the Union player from achieving the historical outcome.<br/><br/>So convene your cabinet, call up your generals, muster your troops, it is time to fight and find out what is the true Price of Freedom!<br/><br/><br/><br/>(from Compass Games website:)Components:<br/>    1 25&quot;x19&quot; cardstock map<br/>    132 counters<br/>    1 deck of 55 playing cards<br/>    2 player-aid cards<br/>    1 rules booklet<br/>    2 6-sided dice<br/>    1 full color box and lid<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "The Price of Freedom: The American Civil War 1861-1865", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Dice Rolling", "Point to Point Movement"], "average": "6.41965", "usersrated": "173", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "age": "12"}, "14702": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic93234.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["A.

The youngest player goes first, by selecting a card and saying, &ldquo;I am a ______(Person, Place, Thing or Year)&rdquo; as shown at the top of the card.  This player becomes that Person, Place, Thing or Year for this round, and is known as the Reader.  Readers should not show their cards to any other player.<br/>2.      Each card has clues numbered 1 through 20&mdash;there is one Person, Place, Thing or Year on each card.<br/>3.      The player on the Reader&rsquo;s left announces a number between 1 and 20, then covers that number on the board with a red chip.<br/>4.      The Reader reads the clue with the same number that the player on the Reader&rsquo;s left chose.<br/>5.      After listening to the clue, the player has 10 seconds to guess the Reader&rsquo;s identity.  Players may only guess on their turn, and must choose a clue before guessing.<br/><br/>    If the player guesses correctly, the player and the Reader determine their score (see Scoring, below), and move their playing pieces.  The player on the Reader&rsquo;s right becomes the new Reader.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>    If the player guesses incorrectly, play continues in a clockwise direction &ndash; the next player on the left chooses a number, covers it on the board with a red chip, listens to a clue, and guesses.  Continue until a player correctly guesses the Reader&rsquo;s identity.  There is no penalty for incorrect guesses.<br/><br/><br/><br/>6.      At any time, players may request that the Reader read all the clues already chosen.<br/><br/>Scoring: <br/>Each 20 Questions card has a value of 20 points.  All 20 points are divided between the Reader and the player who correctly guesses the Reader&rsquo;s identity.  The Reader receives 1 point (moves forward one space) for every number that is covered with a chip.  The Guesser receives 1 point for each unused chip.<br/><br/>Special Clues:<br/><br/>     When the Reader reads &ldquo;One free guess anytime,&rdquo; the player guesses immediately, and then takes a Free Guess Chip.  Players with Free Guess Chips play them before the start of another player&rsquo;s turn, and then guess.  After playing a Free Guess Chip, players return it to the edge of board.<br/>     &ldquo;Lose your turn&rdquo; means that play passes immediately to the next player &ndash; the current player may not guess.<br/>     Players move their pieces after hearing &ldquo;Go ahead&rdquo; and &ldquo;Go back&rdquo; clues, then guess.  No player may be moved back from Start.<br/>     Players who receive a &ldquo;Choose a player to move&rdquo; clue may move any player&rsquo;s piece except their own.<br/>     &ldquo;Guess now and pick another number&rdquo; allows the player a free guess, before choosing a clue.  After the free guess, the same player chooses another number, listens to the clue, and guesses again.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/>Bonus Round: <br/>Any time that players end their move on a Bonus Space they may play a Bonus Round.  To play a Bonus Round, the Reader chooses a card from the deck and identifies it as a Person, Place, Thing or Year.  The Bonus Player announces 5 numbers, one at a time, which the Reader reads as they are chosen.  The Bonus Player may guess after hearing any of the 5 clues, but may only guess once during the Bonus Round.<br/> If the Bonus Player correctly guesses the Reader&rsquo;s identity after just one clue, the Bonus Player moves ahead 10 spaces.  If the Bonus Player needs more clues, scoring is as follows:<br/>2 clues = 8 spaces<br/>3 clues = 6 spaces<br/>4 clues = 4 spaces<br/>5 clues = 2 spaces<br/> When players land on a Bonus Space during the middle of a turn, the Reader continues with the card in play until a player guesses correctly, then starts the Bonus Round.  The Bonus Round ends if the Bonus Player chooses the &ldquo;Lose your turn&rdquo; clue.

The more you play Politics, the deeper your levels of strategy and interactive play develop.<br/><br/>"}, "14722": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Fran\u00e7ois Nedelec"], "poll": [], "name": "La Route des Indes", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Point to Point Movement"], "yearpublished": "1982", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": ["Magazine: Jeux & Strat\u00e9gie"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic62821_t.jpg", "average": "6.125", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Jeux & Strat\u00e9gie"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic62821.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Jeux & Strat\u00e9gie magazine edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Travel"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A magazine game from Jeux et Strat\u00e9gie #15<br/><br/>Players travel from Istanbul to Delhi with 300$ in their pockets, trying to accumulate as many souvenirs as possible.<br/><br/>"}, "14723": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Fran\u00e7ois Nedelec", "Duccio Vitale"], "poll": [], "name": "El Dorado", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1981", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Magazine: Jeux & Strat\u00e9gie"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic904744_t.jpg", "average": "5.8", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Jeux & Strat\u00e9gie"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic904744.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Jeux & Strat\u00e9gie magazine edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Magazine game from Jeux et Strat\u00e9gie #10.<br/><br/>"}, "14724": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Fran\u00e7ois Marcela-Froideval"], "poll": [], "name": "Heraklios", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "yearpublished": "1980", "usersrated": "16", "boardgamefamily": ["Magazine: Jeux & Strat\u00e9gie"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic226057_t.jpg", "average": "6.03125", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Jeux & Strat\u00e9gie"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic226057.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Jeux & Strat\u00e9gie magazine edition"], "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Ancient", "Wargame"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "A magazine game from Jeux et Strat\u00e9gie #6.<br/><br/>Four armies (Athens, Sparta, Macedonia and Persia) fight it out on an hypothetical battlefield.

Three special six-sided dice are used; each dice has three red letters (an &quot;L,&quot; a &quot;C,&quot; and an &quot;R&quot;) along with three black dots.  Players start with three chips.  Each rolls the dice (never any more dice than chips) and distributes chips according to the roll, either to the player on the left, the center (pot), the player on the right, or no action if a black dot is rolled.  Play continues clockwise.  Players without chips can stay in the game because the rolls of others may give them some chips (hence the name of the game), but must pass on their roll.<br/><br/>Never Say Die, published in 1959, was republished almost exactly in 1992 as LCR.  There are two rules in Never Say Die that are missing in LCR.  First, players may permanently &quot;retire&quot; any number of chips over three that they own as individual winnings.  Second, the winner of the pot in Never Say Die is the player who holds the last chip not in the pot and who rolls a &quot;C.&quot;  It's possible that a player will hold the last two or even the last three chips not in the pot; in this case she may be fortunate enough to roll nothing but &quot;C's&quot; and work all her chips to the center to win.  If the player holding the last chip rolls a dot, she keeps rolling until she gets a letter.

Each player controls five Arthurs and a host of other Arthurian characters in a heated attempt to grab and retrieve the sword before any other player succeeds in this task.<br/><br/>On the surface, the game appears to be a very simple wargame, combat being quickly resolved without any dice as characters fight each other. The key to the game, however, is that two players are always taking turns at the same time, the turns being regulated by &quot;turn tokens&quot; that pass around the board. When one player finishes his or her turn, the turn-token is passed to the next player who does not already have one. If one player is a slowpoke taking his turn, then the other turn-token passes around the table, allowing other players to take turns. This forces players to take very fast turns, usually about 5 seconds each, allowing the game to move along with the intensity of a video game. Games usually take 20 to 30 minutes to play, even with three to six players.<br/><br/>Special rules resolve potential conflicts that could occur when two players try to perform actions simultaneously where priority is in question, resolving quickly and simply.<br/><br/>No player ever quite gets knocked out of the game due to loss of characters; Arthurs always &quot;rejuvenate&quot;, returning to your pile of pieces (your &quot;village&quot;) that can enter the board. Characters start at a chosen entry space at the edge of the board, and move to the center to grab Excalibur, returning the Sword to their entry space to win. Each of the 5 character-types (Merlin, Lancelot, etc) have their own unique abilities, but everyone starts with an identical set of pieces.<br/><br/>There are also two variants in the rules, allowing players to vary the game by going after the &quot;Accoutrements of Kingship&quot; instead of the Sword, or by gathering a number of gold pieces scattered around the board so as to &quot;buy the kingship&quot;. Tokens are included for these variants.<br/><br/>The game is very intense and fast, requiring players to think on their feet and make fast realtime decisions; if you are a big fan of slow, deep thinking, strategy games, you might look elsewhere.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "5.25304", "name": "Camelot", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Simultaneous Action Selection"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "115", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["The Legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table"]}, "14813": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Beauty and the Beast Gigantic Magic Mirror Game", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Celebrities: Walt Disney", "Monsters"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic60917_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Canada Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic60917.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Canada Games edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Racing"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Join Belle, Mrs Potts, Chip Lumiere and all the gang on a quest through the world of Beauty &amp; the Beast.

Originally planned to recover the spoils of WW1 when Turkey surrendered, the Allied powers had promised Greece a part of Turkey, which the Greeks claimed was part of &quot;Greater Greece&quot;. The Greeks by the Summer of 1921, had advanced to within 30 km of Ankara, there the critical battle of the Sakarya River ended the advance. The failure of the battle now turned public opinion at home and amongst troops in Turkey against the war. From 1921 to 1922, the Greek Asia Minor Army held a 400 km front line. The Greeks were hoping and desperately looking for a honorable way out of the mess that the British had got them in.

However, oddly enough, they would not sanction adequate ground, sea and air forces to mount it. The British however, possibly because the capture of the Dodecanese had been one of Churchill's favorite projects ever since war began, plunged in hell or high water, ignoring the fact that boldness does not always equate to success. <br/>Kos, even today, remains a quaint island unchanged in many ways since 1943. Located in the Aegean Sea, four miles from the Turkish coast is 28 miles long and 6 miles wide, at the widest point. It has an area of about 115 square miles, and a population of 20,000 in 1943, an airfield at Marmari, near the coast, another at Antimachia, and an emergency landing ground under construction at Lambia, near the town of Kos. The highest elevation is 2800 feet. Because of the airfields and its small port, Kos was one key, which would unlock the Aegean. If it could be taken, argued the British, Rhodes would fall and with Rhodes in British control, the other islands garrisoned with Italians, would certainly surrender. The other Allies, the Americans, were not interested in the least and refused to even lend a few P-38 squadrons until too late.<br/><br/>Thus, the British were on their own to pursue what Churchill had wanted: the soft underbelly of Europe.<br/><br/>OPERATION EISBAR was the German operation, a prelude to Leros, to prevent the British the most important first step: Kos. The game is a unique blend that allows for either player to win. The first step for the Germans is to destroy the three Spitfire squadrons based on Kos. Only when this is accomplished can German forces invade the island or drop their paratroopers. For the British, if they can cause sufficient aircraft losses during the first phase (German air raids), they may persuade them not to invade Kos. Failing this, the British Kos garrison with one battalion must prevent the Germans from either landing or if they land, defeat them on shore. British BB, CV or DD's may suddenly appear causing havoc, yet, become targets for the Luftwaffe. British Beaufighters may also suddenly appear during an air raid or invasion and torpedo the German ships. The Random Events will make each game's outcome totally different. Above all else, the British must fly in their supplies using only eight DC3s during the first phase.<br/><br/>The game's scale is platoons and company sized units, individual ships, each air counter is four aircraft.

This society of treasure hunters, adventure seekers, and artifact collectors gathers men from around the world to share their tales of glory. Each runs a global network, questing for fame, wealth, and the prestige of their home country. Together they pursue a cult that would use the powerful relics for evil, but each adventurer wants the victory to be his alone.<br/><br/>Players follow clues and try to collect all the pieces of an ancient artifacts by strategically deploying their forces and gaining majorities in forgotten territories like El Dorado, Atlantis, and Shangri-La. Leading each team are world famous heroes:<br/><br/>LORD REX HUNTER - Reginald Hunter was heir to a Lordship in Great Britain. His parents were chemists who were doing research in Africa when the family was lost to Ivory poachers. Years later, Rex turned up in the UK with the adventurous spirit and intelligence of his parents and the savage power of his jungle upbringing. He started THE ADVENTURE LEAGUE.<br/><br/>DRAGON PRINCE - A true member of Eastern aristocracy, the Jade Dragon, as some call him, was never content to sit on his riches. He uses it to help those in need and for his globe-spanning adventures to recover lost artifacts of great wealth and power. Best friend of Lord Rex Hunter, but also his fiercest competitor, the Dragon Prince was the first to join his LEAGUE.<br/><br/>DOC ROCKET - &quot;Doc Rocket&quot; is Dr. Werner Von Bronz, one of the greatest scientists of 1920's Germany. He is a physicist, adventurer, and archeologist who scours the globe looking for ancient technologies to incorporate into his gadgets. He is a former WWI fighter pilot of great courage and nobility, loyal to both his own Germany and the LEAGUE.<br/><br/>THE WRAITH - All that is know about his previous life is that he was a police officer in a large American city on a crusade against organized crime. He now fights crime on a global scale with relentless energy and sharp focus. Some say he cannot die. His devoted followers supply him with the scientific and financial resources he needs to carry on his campaign for justice, within and outside of the LEAGUE.<br/><br/>"}, "14900": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Disney's 20 Questions", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1992", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["20 Questions", "Celebrities: Walt Disney"], "maxplayers": "21", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic61795_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["University Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic61795.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Party Game", "Trivia"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "The game consists of 55 cards.

The main goal of the game is to build your settlements, advance them from branches to wards to stakes (settlement to city) so that you can collect more resources (1,2 or 3). Then along the way the final goal is to pay for certain cards with resources and money(gold resource). After all the cards have been collected by the players the one with the most of these special cards (3 different kinds) wins. Along the way there are special cards that allow for the &quot;robber&quot; (every player rolls on the end of their turn to see if they are robbed [on doubles of the dice]) to not influence you, the black crickets card to unaffect you via the seagulls card, missionary cards, divine inspiration cards, paying tithing bonuses, etc. The components need some help, being that it does look like a first production.

Different 'fronts' can be declared.

Players take turns attacking.  After successfully attacking (wherein the defender die is removed from play and the attacker scores the number of sides,) the attacking dice are re-rolled.<br/><br/>A fun way to use a big dice collection.

These points are spent to cook one's own chestnuts without burning them and then to eat them, as well as to burn the other player's chestnuts. The game ends when all of one's player's chestnuts are burnt or eaten. Each eaten chestnut is one positive point and each burnt chestnut is one negative point.

The little town of Elfenbein is covered with snow. To help Santa find his way in the snow, the people of the town have dug out 'streets' and crooked 'paths' between their houses. Now they are all waiting patiently in their homes for Santa's presents, roasting chestnuts on an open fire to kill the time. All people, except some naughty kids. They have discovered a new game: Santa watching! Santa enjoys the game too as he is the only one who has discovered the crooked paths.

This was card #9 and was sent out in 1998. It features artwork by Doris Matth&auml;us.<br/><br/>One player is Santa and the other 2-3 players are the naughty kids. Each player is given the cards of one suit from a normal deck of cards. A round consists of each player simultaneously choosing a card to play. Whoever plays the highest card selects the order of play for the round. Each player's card will also determine how far that player can move. Santa scores points for dropping off presents at houses without being seen. The naughty kids each score points for seeing Santa and collecting the presents he's delivering. The game lasts 13 rounds (the number of cards each player has).<br/><br/>Mik Svellov's website states &quot;Han Heidema was given credit as a gesture by Alan Moon.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "14996": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic66668.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Ticket to Ride: First Journey (Europe)", "Ticket to Ride"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Alan R.

From Edinburgh to Constantinople and from Lisbon to Moscow, you'll visit great cities of turn-of-the-century Europe. Like the original Ticket to Ride, the game remains elegantly simple, can be learned in 5 minutes, and appeals to both families and experienced gamers. Ticket to Ride: Europe is a complete, new game and does not require the original version.<br/><br/>More than just a new map, Ticket to Ride: Europe features brand new gameplay elements. Tunnels may require you to pay extra cards to build on them, Ferries require locomotive cards in order to claim them, and Stations allow you to sacrifice a few points in order to use an opponent's route to connect yours. The game also includes larger format cards and Train Station game pieces.<br/><br/>The overall goal remains the same: collect and play train cards in order to place your pieces on the board, attempting to connect cities on your ticket cards. Points are earned both from placing trains and completing tickets but uncompleted tickets lose you points. The player who has the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Copyright 2002-2014 Days of Wonder, inc.<br/><br/>Part of the Ticket to Ride series.<br/><br/> Online Play <br/><br/>     Xbox LIVE Arcade<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Brazilian First edition", "Croatian/Serbian/Slovenian first edition", "Czech edition", "Dutch edition", "English edition 2005", "English edition 2008", "English edition 2011", "English edition 2012", "Finnish first edition", "French edition", "German first edition", "German second edition", "Greek Edition", "Hungarian edition", "Hungarian second edition", "Italian edition", "Japanese first edition", "Polish Edition", "Portuguese edition", "Romanian first edition", "Russian first edition", "Scandinavian edition", "Spanish first edition"], "average": "7.59199", "videogamebg": ["Ticket to Ride: Europe"], "name": "Ticket to Ride: Europe", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Route/Network Building", "Set Collection"], "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": ["Antarctica (fan expansion to Ticket to Ride)", "Les Aventuriers du rail \u00e0 Lyon (fan expansion to Ticket to Ride)", "Les Aventuriers du rail en Belgique (fan expansion to Ticket to Ride)", "Bretagne (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride)", "Britain & Ireland (fan expansion to Ticket To Ride: Europe)", "Canada (fan expansion to Ticket to Ride)", "Castilla y Le\u00f3n (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride)", "Alsace (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride)", "China (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride)", "Cuba: Region Occidental (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride)", "The Emerald City (fan expansion to Ticket to Ride)", "Extension France (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride)", "Holland (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride)", "Holland Express (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride)", "Indiana (fan expansion to Ticket to Ride)", "Italy (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride)", "Italy (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride)", "Italy (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride)", "Japan (fan expansion to Ticket To Ride)", "Komor\u00f3w (fan expansion to Ticket to Ride)", "Lietuva (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride)", "London Underground (fan expansion to Ticket to Ride)", "New destination tickets for TtR Europe (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride)", "North-Africa (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride)", "Ohio (fan expansion to Ticket to Ride)", "\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland in the 1930's (fan expansion to Ticket to Ride)", "\u00d6sterreich Karte: Zug um Zug (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride)", "Qu\u00e9bec et l'Est du Canada (fan expansion to Ticket to Ride)", "Quebec Province (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride)", "Reise durch \u00c4gypten (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride)", "Rom\u00e2nia (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride: Europe)", "Russian Empire 1912 (fan expansion to Ticket to Ride)", "Scandinavia (fan expansion to Ticket to Ride)", "Seattle (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride)", "South-East Sweden 1925 (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride)", "Sweden (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride)", "Ticket to Finland (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride)", "Ticket to Ride Map Collection: Volume 1 \u2013 Team Asia & Legendary Asia", "Ticket to Ride Map Collection: Volume 2 \u2013 India & Switzerland", "Ticket to Ride Map Collection: Volume 3 \u2013 The Heart of Africa", "Ticket to Ride Map Collection: Volume 4 \u2013 Nederland", "Ticket to Ride Map Collection: Volume 5 \u2013 United Kingdom & Pennsylvania", "Ticket to Ride: Alvin & Dexter", "Ticket to Ride: Europa 1912", "Ticket to Ride: Orient Express", "Ticket to Ride: Switzerland", "Ticket to Ride: The Dice Expansion", "UK (fan expansion to Ticket to Ride)", "UK (fan expansion to Ticket to Ride)", "UK Cynical Edition (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride)", "UK version 2.0 (fan expansion to Ticket to Ride)", "Ukraine (fan expansion to Ticket to Ride)", "USSR (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride)", "Wild Wild West (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride)"], "usersrated": "35129", "boardgameaccessory": ["Premium Wooden Train Token Set", "Ticket to Ride: Halloween Freighter", "Wooden Train Token Set (50 Pack)"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Ticket to Ride"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BGWS 014 \u2013 Ticket to Ride Europe, Switzerland and M\u00e4rklin", "Episode 12 - Ticket to Ride Europe", "Episode 13 - The Vault", "Episode 2 - A-B-C, 1-2-3", "Episode 9 - Carcassonne", "Podcast #043 - Guia de compras y recomendaciones de juegos de mesa 2011 Parte 1", "Podcast EP02 \u2013 Recommandations de jeux \u00e0 2 joueurs", "Podcast EP10 \u2013 Top 10 jeux de soci\u00e9t\u00e9", "Rules #18: Ticket to Ride Europe", "What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing Week 55!!!
