In ACNOS, players manipulate armies of shapes within a standard 8x8 chessboard with a win condition of either capturing the opponent&rsquo;s treasure square, or depriving the opponent of a legal move.<br/><br/>There are 24 pieces per side in ACNOS, each of which has unique move sets determined by the arrows shown on their face. Throughout the game, pieces get placed on the board, moved according to their arrows, flipped to produce mirror images, rotated in multiples of 90 degrees, or merged to create more powerful shapes. During setup, players secretly choose a treasure square and 8 pieces to surround it. Each turn, players choose to activate one of three abilities (place a new piece on the board under your control, build a blockade to remove a square from the board, or declare a merge between two pieces to make a stack), then choose two different pieces under their control and move them. Initially, pieces are limited to 2 shapes per merge stack, but when a piece makes it to the other side of the board, it can teleport home by moving off the opponents back rank, thereby deepening its merge potential by one extra piece.<br/><br/>ACNOS is extremely complex (over 10^35 legal setups, 36 million possible states per square, over 200 thousand legal first moves on average), and rewards deep strategic thinking, careful planning, and tactical calculations. Acknowledge the potential, and capture your opponent&rsquo;s treasure! NOTE: For casual play, reserve pieces are drawn randomly from a bag, with each &ldquo;next piece&rdquo; being public information. For tournaments, players determine the order of reserve pieces during setup phase, and the entire order becomes public information when the veil is lifted.<br/><br/>"}, "227503": {"poll": [], "name": "The Bulldog Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1973", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Selchow & Righter"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Children's Game"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The Bulldog Game is a spin &amp; move game of collecting bones for 2-4 players.

Over the course of the game, each player trise to augment their capabilities by obtaining useful cards in particular cities that will efficiently help them carry out the rituals to sow terror among the residents and hold their own against other leaders.<br/><br/>Custom-made followers' dice are an element that brings uncertainty and fragility into the game.

It will provide a general overview of what happens, without spoiling anything. A good premise contains, explicitly or by implication, four key elements of the story: who the protagonists are, what the goal of the story is, the sorts of obstacles that need to be overcome to achieve the story goal, and who the antagonist is.<br/><br/>Each premise provided in this book is more than just a story hook or adventure seed. It is the beginning of a story, your story, that you can flesh out and develop to suit your specific needs. These can be used again and again by varying the details and changing the four key elements.<br/><br/><br/>Protagonists<br/><br/>The assumption is that you already have player characters created, if not fully established. For that reason, elements of the premise should be tweaked to suit the abilities and personalities of the protagonists and not the other way around. Suggested character capabilities useful in completing the story goal may be listed, but if no protagonist possesses these traits then a supporting character should be inserted to compensate. Likewise, ties to background elements can either be retconned into a protagonist's history, or given to a supporting character who can ask for the protagonists' help, or hires them to pursue the story goal on their behalf, as appropriate.<br/><br/><br/>Story Goals<br/><br/>The story goal is the objective that the protagonists must achieve in order to successfully complete the adventure. It&rsquo;s the way you know that the story is over, and can help keep the players focused and the protagonists on the right track. In a simplified 3-act structure, Act 1 will have the protagonists learning about the story goal and deciding to pursue it. Act 2 will present a series of obstacles that need to be overcome in order to accomplish the story goal. Act 3 will have the protagonists face the final obstacle, defeat the antagonist, achieve the story goal, and earn their rewards.<br/><br/><br/>Obstacles<br/><br/>Achieving the story goal shouldn&rsquo;t be easy, and the protagonists will need to overcome an escalating series of obstacles. These might be linked thematically, or tied into the sort of goal that needs to be achieved. Start with a simple obstacle early in the story, something that plays to the protagonists&rsquo; strengths and will be relatively easy to defeat. Then think of the hardest thing possible, pushing the limits of their capabilities, and make that the final obstacles. Flesh out the middle with obstacles that are increasingly more difficult.<br/><br/><br/>Antagonists<br/><br/>Each protagonist has a personal goal that they are trying to achieve, as well as a motivation for pursuing that goal. This might place them in opposition to, ior nto competition with, the protagonists. If the premise fits with an established antagonist, you should use them and tweak other elements of the premise to fit their personalities and abilities. Otherwise, you can create a new antagonist that suits the particulars of your desired story and overall campaign needs.<br/><br/>"}, "227678": {"rpgartist": ["Arturo Gutierrez", "Rich Lescouflair", "Louis Porter, Jr. Design Studio", "Odysseas Stamoglou"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Crisis of the World Eater: The Collected Epic", "rpgdesigner": ["Michael McCarthy", "Louis Porter, Jr."], "rpgproducer": ["Louis Porter, Jr. Design Studio", "Michael McCarthy", "Louis Porter, Jr.", "Joshua Yearsley"], "usersrated": "0", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3559371.jpg", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgsetting": ["NeoExodus: A House Divided"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Louis Porter Jr. Design, Inc."], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Crisis of the World Eater", "NeoExodus Legacies"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3559371_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Crisis of the World Eater: The Collected Epic a 106-page adventure written by Michael McCarthy for 5th to 17th level player characters.<br/><br/>For the first time ever, the complete Crisis of the World Eater epic four-part campaign serial is available in one collected source.<br/><br/>A Warning Too Late by Michael McCarthy for 5th level player characters.<br/><br/>All across the world, an unexpected psychic broadcast seeps into the mind of every living thing, filling their minds with portents of death and destruction.

These can be used again and again by varying the details and changing the four key elements.<br/><br/><br/>Protagonists<br/><br/>The assumption is that you already have player characters created, if not fully established. For that reason, elements of the premise should be tweaked to suit the abilities and personalities of the protagonists and not the other way around. Suggested character capabilities useful in completing the story goal may be listed, but if no protagonist possesses these traits then a supporting character should be inserted to compensate. Likewise, ties to background elements can either be retconned into a protagonist's history, or given to a supporting character who can ask for the protagonists' help, or hires them to pursue the story goal on their behalf, as appropriate.<br/><br/><br/>Story Goals<br/><br/>The story goal is the objective that the protagonists must achieve in order to successfully complete the adventure. It&rsquo;s the way you know that the story is over, and can help keep the players focused and the protagonists on the right track. In a simplified 3-act structure, Act 1 will have the protagonists learning about the story goal and deciding to pursue it. Act 2 will present a series of obstacles that need to be overcome in order to accomplish the story goal. Act 3 will have the protagonists face the final obstacle, defeat the antagonist, achieve the story goal, and earn their rewards.<br/><br/><br/>Obstacles<br/><br/>Achieving the story goal shouldn&rsquo;t be easy, and the protagonists will need to overcome an escalating series of obstacles. These might be linked thematically, or tied into the sort of goal that needs to be achieved. Start with a simple obstacle early in the story, something that plays to the protagonists&rsquo; strengths and will be relatively easy to defeat. Then think of the hardest thing possible, pushing the limits of their capabilities, and make that the final obstacles. Flesh out the middle with obstacles that are increasingly more difficult.<br/><br/><br/>Antagonists<br/><br/>Each protagonist has a personal goal that they are trying to achieve, as well as a motivation for pursuing that goal. This might place them in opposition to, ior nto competition with, the protagonists. If the premise fits with an established antagonist, you should use them and tweak other elements of the premise to fit their personalities and abilities. Otherwise, you can create a new antagonist that suits the particulars of your desired story and overall campaign needs.<br/><br/>"}, "227772": {"rpgdesigner": ["Russ Brown", "Joe Kondrak", "Isaac Volynskiy"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Hydra Vine", "rpgartist": ["Graeme Cunningham"], "rpgproducer": ["Russ Brown"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3562322.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Rusted Iron Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Deadly Gardens"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3562322_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Deadly Gardens is a series of short PDF documents that each feature a brand new plant monster to use in your Pathfinder Roleplaying Game or OGL campaigns.

Bishop.<br/><br/>The first level of Purple Mountain is the current home to a cult of the Locust Lord, a demonic entity dedicated to vermin, chasms, and infestations. Twenty years ago, the wizard Iraksed came to the Purple Mountain to discover secrets of transformation into an immortal invertebrate form. His destructive tendencies and ability to manipulate the manamites present in the first level of Purple Mountain earned him the grace of the Locust Lord and Iraksed began the painful process of shedding his mortal form into his current squirming one.<br/><br/>Recently Iraksed and his manamite followers have grown in power and potential for destruction. The manamites have captured and trained a number of vermin, including a throach. The throach, known to the manamites as the Instrument of the Locust Lord, has the ability to implant hosts with its verminous offspring. These offspring eventually tear themselves free of their host. The manamites love both the birth of throach grubs from within the bodies of other sentient races and the screams of their hosts as the larval throach burst free. To supply the throach with a constant supply of hosts, the manamites occasionally venture out of Purple Mountain to capture travellers or nearby villagers.<br/><br/>The Purple Mountain series is designed to be the classic megadungeon in every way.<br/><br/>"}, "227774": {"rpgdesigner": ["Russ Brown"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "statistics": [], "name": "Template Races: Half-Humans", "rpgartist": ["Elizabeth Courts"], "rpgproducer": ["Russ Brown"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3562324.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Rusted Iron Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3562324_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Half-elves and half-orcs have long been a staple of fantasy roleplaying game worlds.

Emperor Constantine has just sanctioned Christianity as a legitimate religion within the Roman Empire, but now discovers that Christians do not agree on the most fundamental aspects of their beliefs. Some Christians have resorted to violence, battling over which group has the correct theology. Constantine is outraged that he has to settle what he regards as petty disputes between factions. Hoping to settle these problems at a great Church Council to be held in Nicaea, Constantine has invited all of the Bishops of the Church to attend. The outcome of this conference will shape the future of Christianity for millennia. The first order of business is to agree on a Creed which states the core theology of the Church and to which all future Christians will have to subscribe if they are to be regarded as holding to the &rdquo;true faith.&rdquo; Those who will reject the Nicaean Creed will be deemed heretical and subject to discipline or even exclusion from the Church. The basic questions to be decided include: Who or what was Jesus and what was his relationship to God? How should the Church be organized? What should be the rules of behavior for its leaders? What is the role of women in the Church? Some will attempt to use this creed to continue their battles and to exclude their enemies from the Church. If they succeed, Constantine may fail to achieve his goal of unity in both empire and Church. He will do everything in his power to assure that agreement is reached, but, given the animosity between the factions, he will need all of the skills which allowed him to become sole Emperor. The debate over theology is informed by reading about the various theological positions of the time using Bart Ehrman&rsquo;s Lost Christianities and readings from a range of non-canonical Christian texts including the Gospel of Thomas.<br/><br/>"}, "227783": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["DOCX Version 1.2", "PDF Version 1"], "rpgseries": ["Reacting to the Past Microgames"], "name": "Egyptian Prison/Council of Antioch Micro Game", "rpgdesigner": ["David E.

South Africa is facing tremendous social anxiety and violence. The object of the talks, and of the game, is to reach consensus for a constitution that will guide a post-apartheid South Africa. The country has immense racial diversity--white, black, Colored, Indian. For the negotiations, however, race turns out to be less critical than cultural, economic, and political diversity. Students are challenged to understand a complex landscape and to navigate a surprising web of alliances.<br/><br/>The game focuses on the problem of transitioning a society conditioned to profound inequalities and harsh political repression into a more democratic, egalitarian system. Students will ponder carefully the meaning of democracy as a concept and may find that justice and equality are not always comfortable partners with liberty. While for the majority of South Africans, universal suffrage was a symbol of new democratic beginnings, it seemed to threaten the lives, families, and livelihoods of minorities and parties outside the African National Congress coalition. These deep tensions in the nature of democracy pose important questions about the character of justice and the best mechanisms for reaching national decisions.<br/><br/>"}, "227802": {"poll": [], "name": "Xenocracy", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["European PlayStation Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3563828.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction", "War - Future"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Simis Limited"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Shooter", "Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Grolier Interactive Publishing Inc."], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3563828_t.jpg", "description": "The year is 10,600 of the Common Era and mankind has colonized space.

The controversy pushed Massachusetts to the brink of collapse and spurred a significant exodus.

The Trial of Anne Hutchinson plunges participants into a religious world that will be unfamiliar to many of them. Yet the puritans&rsquo; passionate struggles over how far they could tolerate a diversity of religious opinions in a colony committed to religious unity were part of a larger historical process that led to religious freedom and the modern concept of separation of church and state.

But it matters which nine ratify, and without New York, which separates New England from the mid-Atlantic states, no viable union will form. At least some New Yorkers say this, those hostile to the Constitution or merely neutral and wanting not to be hurried into ratifying. Those friendly caution that if New York takes too long to ratify, or rejects altogether, it will lose out on the chance of having the nation&rsquo;s new capital located in the state. Meanwhile two other states, New Hampshire and Virginia, are currently in convention, racing to be the ninth state which puts the Constitution over.<br/><br/>The popular press refers to ratifying states as pillars of the Federal government. With each new ratification a new illustration appears, showing the multiplying line-up of pillars, usually with the hand of Providence extending from a cloud, lifting the latest one into place. If New Hampshire ratifies as the ninth state and Virginia has the tenth, then New York, when ratifying, will become the ELEVENTH PILLAR in the colonnade.<br/><br/>Friends of the Constitution go by the name of Federalists, opponents by the name of Antifederalists.<br/><br/>"}, "227924": {"rpgartist": ["Paul Bourne", "Sam Manley", "Scott Purdy"], "rpg": ["Lone Wolf Adventure Game"], "statistics": [], "name": "Bestiary of the Beyond", "rpgdesigner": ["Joe Dever", "August Hahn", "Vincent Lazzari", "Darren Pearce"], "rpgproducer": ["Paul Bourne", "Jon Hodgson", "Vincent Lazzari", "Dominic McDowall"], "usersrated": "0", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3564557.png", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgsetting": ["Magnamund"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Cubicle 7 Entertainment"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3564557_t.png", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>This book catalogues some of the most famous and infamous creatures of Magnamund and presents them in an easy to use format for the Lone Wolf Adventure Game system.

The game uses &ldquo;action cards&rdquo; drawn at random to determine player success on what is essentially a five point scale with complete success at one end, complete failure at the other, and a few outcomes in between. The GM also draws from a similar set of five cards and this is where it gets interesting and where the risk/reward mechanic comes into play. Depending on the GM card, the player&rsquo;s action card can go to the player, be passed onto another player, go to the GM&rsquo;s pile for their use, or its outcome is determined by a player vote. While at first glance it would seem to the player&rsquo;s benefit to discard action cards with negative results and hold onto action cards with positive results, player also need to hold onto action cards as a form of HP. Lose all your action cards while wounded and you die. This leads to situations where players feel compelled to hold onto bad cards simply to have cards in their hand and keep their characters alive, knowing that they may randomly draw these bad cards while performing their actions. It&rsquo;s a simple mechanic, but one I really enjoyed, and as stated previously, I&rsquo;d love to see further developed.<br/><br/>"}, "227997": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["200 Word Challenge 2017 plaintext"], "poll": [], "name": "Kataware Doki", "rpgdesigner": ["Joseph LeMay"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Kataware Doki"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal", "Social (Relationships / Romance)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpgseries": ["200 Word RPG Challenge 2017"], "average": "0", "description": "Publisher summary<br/>Alternate turns living a day in one another's lives.

The game's campaign will be more narrative oriented than the sandbox campaign of the first game with each race battling to save or destroy the Great Vortex over Ulthuan.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_War%3A_Warhammer_II Total War: Warhammer II]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}}
