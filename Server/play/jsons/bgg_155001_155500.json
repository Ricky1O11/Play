It takes you into the world of aristocratic intrigues and struggles for power which tore the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from its heyday during the Union of Lublin, until the Targowica Confederation and the fall of the Polish-Lithuanian state.<br/><br/>Players take on the roles of magnates who seek to develop their own family's power in a moment favorable to fortune: the prime of the Union of Poland and Lithuania. The most eminent families fight for prestige and landed estates: the Lubomirski, the Potocki, the Radziwi\u0142\u0142, the Sapieha and the Zamoyski.<br/><br/>Each player has a deck of cards depicting well-known personages from a given family. Some of these characters are outstanding people, capable of great deeds. But there are also less useful people, able to spoil any undertaking entrusted them... unless, thanks to the player's decisions, even those lesser ones will do much for the family.<br/><br/>During the game, players will manage their deck of characters so that, in competition with others, they can achieve as much as possible on each of the planes of life of the Commonwealth. Players will clash during the creation of the state's internal policy, as well as in response to external threats and opportunities arising from the international situation. And so, as it happened in reality, the fate of the country will be the result of the sum of actions of the most powerful aristocratic families. If the players lose themselves in a mutual fight for titles and advantage, the Commonwealth will collapse under the pressure of the neighboring powers.<br/><br/>In MAGNATES, players will face many dilemmas. The most prominent members of the family will ensure beneficial rights in the Sejm and prestigious positions in the Senate. Moreover, they comply with the Monarch's will easily, and thanks to them the family will gain estates and power. But how will a player handle the remaining challenges? Who will undertake an expedition to Livonia? Will the troops protecting the country against enemy invasion, in the absence of other candidates, be again led by incompetents (like &quot;peryna, latyna and dytyna&rdquo;)? Will there be enough determination to hasten to the relief of Vienna? Will the players succeed in saving the Homeland from partitioning?<br/><br/>Is your Family ready for a Game of Power?<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "Polish first edition", "Spanish first edition"], "average": "6.87909", "name": "The Magnates: A Game of Power", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Auction/Bidding", "Hand Management"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["Magnaci: Nadanie tytu\u0142u ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119cego", "Magnaci: Zdrada", "The Magnates: A Game of Power \u2013 O santa piva di Polonia"], "usersrated": "361", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games", "Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Poland", "Crowdfunding: Wspieram"]}, "155026": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Stefan Karamanov"], "poll": [], "name": "Y\u016bgen", "playingtime": "25", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1930663_t.png", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1930663.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "25", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Print & Play"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "25", "description": "Y\u016bgen (yoo-gehn) is a fast, semi-casual game for 2 players, with each game about 20 to 30 minutes long.

It pits small elite teams of &quot;Agents&quot; against the evils and aliens of this world. The monsters are normally referred to as creatures and the Aliens as &quot;XRAYs&quot;. InEPTT is built with three basic Genres of play 1890 to 1930, 1930 to 1960 and 1960 to 2020.<br/><br/>These genres have various weapons armouries with which you can build your teams to take on the Creatures and XRAY's that you will face. The game uses the term Mission for a single scenario and Operation for a series of linked Missions. You can build your team as you go as you collect credits with successful mission completion and &quot;kills&quot; of Creatures and XRAYs. The game is run by a Game Master (GM) who designs and runs the missions and or operations and the scope is massive!<br/><br/>There are two &quot;Missions&quot; in the core rules but those missions lend themselves to quick development into literally hundreds of missions with minor tweaks to terrain, victory conditions and forces involved. Some of the key points for InEPTT from a mini/terrain view point is &ndash; there are no specific miniatures that you &quot;must&quot; buy. You can use just about anything you want really, the one stipulation being that Allies and Henchmen should be a What You See is What You Get concept, but for your Agents (term for InEPTT Soldiers) you can use any figure you like. Also the teams range from 3 to 12 so you don't need hordes of figures although your XRAYs and Creatures will often need to out number Agents by as many as 3 to 1 and for zombies 5 to 1 or more &ndash; but that is up to the GM. Also the games usually run from 30 minutes (small 4 x 4 table) to 4 hours for massive 10 x 6 table with 5 teams and over 40 bad guys, with all teams having separate Mission Orders to complicate the system even more. The game has huge amounts of growth still and there is depth in every category from which to develop more and more.<br/><br/>"}, "155047": {"poll": [], "name": "Batman: Arkham Origins (Mobile)", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iPhone/iPad edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1950021.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Batman: Arkham"], "videogametheme": ["Superhero"], "videogamegenre": ["Beat 'em Up", "Fighting"], "videogamedeveloper": ["NetherRealm Studios"], "videogamefranchise": ["Batman"], "videogameplatform": ["iPad", "iPhone"], "usersrated": "1", "average": "8", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Warner Bros.

The game is a small box game. It consists of a 3-piece (puzzle type) game board, 3 cardboard figures (Paddington, Mr. and Mrs. Brown) and 25 plastic chips as well as 2 colour dice. The game board has spots in red, blue yellow etc. round in a circle. In game variation one all 3 figures are placed randomly on the board. On his turn a player rolls both dice. He/she assigns each roll to a figure on the board and moves two figures according to the die roll. E.g. the dice show red and yellow: then the player must move 2 of the three figures. One on any red space, one on any yellow space. When the three figures are located next to each other a photo is shot. The player achieving the photo shot gets a chip as reward. Once a photo is completed the middle figure runs away to the opposite space of the same colour. After 20 photos are shot the game ends, player with the most chips wins. In a variation a photo is especially well taken when Paddington is in the middle. Then the player gets 2 chips for this kind of photo shot.

The alien can move around the starship, attack, cocoon, activate a malfunctioning android, sabotage equipment and the vessel's wiring, scurry into vents, and more; while the starship crew can fire flamethrowers, search, move or run, protect themselves with shock-prods, hide, shut security doors, and other actions.<br/><br/>Lifeform is a standalone, dice-less game that tells of ten commercial astronauts working on a battered mining starship, far away in space and time, who encounter an awesome galactic horror. Featuring an innovative self-destruct game mechanism, and alternate playable endings, depending on crew success, Lifeform presents a tense, suspenseful adventure with each and every game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "age": "10", "name": "Lifeform", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Hand Management", "Partnerships", "Point to Point Movement", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Variable Player Powers"], "average": "8", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": ["Aliens"]}, "155066": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1925", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1931574_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Stoll & Edwards Company"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1931574.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Novel-based"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Simple race game based on the Mark Twain novel first published in the United States in 1885. <br/>The first player, who cross the road, wins the game.<br/>Came with 4 playing pieces, 15 cards, 3 dice.<br/><br/>"}, "155067": {"average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Roastmaster General", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1960063_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Greg Pair"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "(Unpublished)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1960063.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Humor", "Mature / Adult", "Party Game"], "age": "17", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "A card game in which one player at a time is roasted.

The comanders enlisted to lead the First Response Initiative are capable and will fight fiercely to defend humanity, but they are still a product of their era and therefore are very interested in their own agenda as well: after the invasion ends, they want a place of power for themselves.<br/><br/>THE MENACE<br/>In First Response, you know very little about your enemy. You only know that they are stronger, have incredible technology and are very aggressive.<br/>Where are they from? What are their objectives? You will probably never know.<br/>They invaded without warning and never attempted to communicate. It is impossible to interrogate them as most of their soldiers dissolve in a pile of goo seconds after dying and the corpses of their leaders are also of little help (you can&rsquo;t keep them alive  for more than a few hours).<br/>You don&rsquo;t even know how they talk among themselves as they emit almost no sound (and some don&rsquo;t even have a mouth).<br/>Your soldiers are prone to panic when confronting them and you do not have enough resources to build and research what you need, let alone what you want.<br/>What can you possibly do to change that?<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>In First Response, whenever you prepare to fight or actually fight the alien menace you might gain Victory Points.<br/>Each game round has two phases: Scanning for Activity and Action.<br/>In the scanning for Activity Phase, players will &ldquo;seed&rdquo; the world, dictating the rhythm of the game and setting everything up for the next Phase.<br/>In the Action Phase, players can do one of two things: manage their bases or go into a mission.<br/>While managing your base you will spend resources to recruit personnel, build facilities, research new technologies and so on.<br/>Missions can be on the air or on the ground and they are the best opportunity to acquire VP and put your hands in precious loot (like parts from alien ships). It is also an opportunity to promote your rookies to veterans (if they survive) an gain medals for acts of bravery (or stupidity).<br/>The game is played in this manner until the Response Marker reaches the Game Over, Man space or until the Terror Marker reaches  a certain point in the Terror Track.<br/>Both conditions trigger the final phase of the game: the Assault on the Alien Base, a very difficult mission with special conditions for  acquiring Victory Points.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE<br/>As the commander of one of First Response Initiative (FRI) bases in a secret location in the world, your personal objective is to be recognized as the best one to lead us against the alien menace.<br/>The winner of First Response is the one with most Victory Points (VP) by the end of the game.<br/>If you manage to destroy the Alien Base at the end, the winner will be chosen as the new leader of the FRI.<br/>If you fail, the winner will  be the leader of the underground resistance against the new master race on the planet.<br/>In that case, the game will be over, but the fight will continue...<br/><br/>THE STANDARD AND ADVANCED RULES<br/>The first part of the rulebook comprises the standard set of rules of the game, with more complicated cards and interactions available in the Advanced Rules.<br/>The standard rules are enough for a great experience and veteran gamers should not skip it, as at least one play with this more straightforward approach can significantly enhance further plays as you have the opportunity to get acquainted with the game flow and to get a firm grasp of the rules.<br/>The advanced rules will add variety and complexity. Timing will be much more important. Negotiations will be much more important. Knowing what your opponents are planning will be much more important. And the aliens will also be tougher.<br/>You will also have more tools to deal with the aliens and to change the game environment. You also can, if you want, add just some elements of the Advanced Rules and introduce them to your game group in small doses.<br/>Keep in mind, though that some of the advanced rules complement each other and work better with the full set of rules.<br/><br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS<br/>The standard rules are for games of 3 to 5 players. However, the 5-player game requires some minor alterations that are highlighted in the rulebook when necessary.<br/><br/>OPTIONAL DIFICULTIES AND MODULES<br/>First Response also comes with some optional stuff. Those includes difficulty settings for the game (including the sadistic IRONMAN MODE), a customizable way to taylor how the game advances and a cooperative variant. The cooperative variant supports 2 to 4 players.<br/><br/>"}, "155072": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2219464.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Geoff Engelstein", "Sydney Engelstein"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "10", "boardgameartist": ["William Bricker"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Stronghold Games"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2219464_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Expansion for Base-game", "Real-time", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration"], "description": "Space Cadets: Dice Duel &ndash; Die Fighter brings two new experiences to the Dice Duel universe to give veterans a whole new way to play:<br/><br/>&bull; Fighters are flown by a single person and are fast and maneuverable, but lack shields and can be easily destroyed.

If 3 cards of the same color are played in a row then the toilet is Flushed and that toilet is reset with zero poop cards.

Kids love it because of the silly designs and opportunity to make poop jokes.

It's an attempt to create an original system that focuses on a diverse set of abilities rather than simply on combat, as many roleplaying games do. It also uses mechanics that are made to replicate circumstances from the show, particularly the secondary stats as the Elements of Harmony. What this book is not, however, is a guide to the setting. Many resources exist to help GMs and players understand the setting of the series, and to put them in this book would almost certainly violate the creators' intellectual property rights.<br/><br/>This book is not meant to be all-inclusive, nor is anything meant to be concrete. A GM's judgement overrides the rules in this book, though they should do their best to stick to what's presented here in terms of stats and how to use them. The rules of this game should be easier for experienced pencil and paper roleplayers to grasp, but I've done my best to present it in a manner that makes it easy to understand.<br/><br/>To play this game, you will need at least one set of polyhedral dice, including a 4-sided die, a 6-sided die, an 8-sided die, a 10-sided die, and a 12-sided die. You will also need a more experienced player to serve as the Gamemaster or GM, a sort of narrarator who helps the other players tell their stories by presenting them with various obstacles and helping to determine the outcomes of their actions. In a game like this, while there may be individual contests with specific winners, there are no real &quot;losers&quot;, and everyone is a winner as long as fun is had.<br/><br/>"}, "155092": {"rpgdesigner": ["Sam Hanson", "Casey Hayes", "Dominik Makowski", "James Weimer"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "My Little Pony: Roleplaying is Magic (Season Three Edition)", "rpgartist": ["Shannon McMurtry", "Silentmatten", "Michael Simpson", "Caytlin Vilbrandt"], "rpgproducer": ["Alan Baker", "Sam Hanson", "Daniel Oakley", "Michael Simpson", "Caytlin Vilbrandt"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1931397.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["My Little Pony"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Animal (Anthropomorphic)", "Animation / Comics (Western Cartoon / Comic)", "Fantasy", "Modern (Pop Culture)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Roan Arts LLC"], "rpg": ["Roleplaying is Magic"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1931397_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/><br/>Once upon a time, in the magical land of Equestria...<br/><br/>With the Season Three Edition, My Little Pony: Roleplaying is Magic has returned with greatly expanded content, new and improved character options, and a more cohesive, streamlined design to appeal to Bronies of all ages.

It was the comics-coded-four-color-silver-age, and it wasn&rsquo;t until Watchmen and Dark Knight and DC&rsquo;s Vertigo line of comics &ldquo;suggested for mature readers&rdquo; came along that I came to like superheroes again, learned that superheroes almost always have a human side, learned that you could tell a story about a superhero and it could still be a good story with good writing.<br/><br/>Likewise, I haven&rsquo;t played many superhero RPG&rsquo;s. Because most of them shoot for that silver age feel. They&rsquo;re for kids. There&rsquo;s lots of punching and explosions and psychic nosebleeds and maybe even talking gorillas but there isn&rsquo;t much real drama or character.<br/><br/>So I started looking for the game that would do superheroes the way I wanted them, all grown up. Tried Sorcerer ... Capes &hellip; Fiasco &hellip; Just Heroes &hellip; Microscope &hellip; these games were all good but not exactly what I was looking for. It looked like if I wanted a superhero game to meet my needs I&rsquo;d have to make it myself.<br/><br/>A campaign of Joe McDaldno&rsquo;s Monsterhearts accidentally ended up being the best &ldquo;superhero&rdquo; RPG I&rsquo;d ever played. Ostensibly a game about monsters, I played a character who decided to use his monster-powers for good, who wore a costume and fought crime, and because that&rsquo;s the way Monsterhearts rolls he ended up doing more harm than good, lost his way, but finally got his shit together and made the ultimate sacrifice to stop a vampire who may not have been all that bad a guy&hellip; It. Was. Awesome.<br/><br/>So &hellip; I made this. To see if I can recapture some of that lightning and be explicitly superheroic. You could practically call this game &ldquo;Superhearts&rdquo; because it owes so much to Joe. Like Monsterhearts and Just Heroes, it&rsquo;s a hack of Apocalypse World.

There are a lot of strange creatures from fantasy novels and movies, from ancient mythology, and, as time went on, from the twisted minds of game designers and even GMs, for that matter. Anyone today who tried to go about creating an extensive bestiary of all the different cool and interesting fantasy monsters could fill three or four volumes with three hundred monsters each, and still have a long way left to go, with fans crying out for various &ldquo;forgotten&rdquo; monsters to get some attention. That kind of breadth doesn&rsquo;t leave a whole lot of room for depth, and that&rsquo;s where Exotic Encounters came in.<br/><br/>The Exotic Encounters series focused on providing new and creative twists on well-known, iconic monsters, providing new options for GMs to use creatures like cyclopes, medusas, nightmares, and all manner of other monsters at a wider range of CRs. But the monsters included here are more than just existing stat-blocks with Hit Dice added or subtracted: each monster has at least one unique ability never seen anywhere else, and each of the monsters has been reimagined and cast in a new, creative light that transforms it into something that is both familiar and resonant, while still being new and exciting.<br/><br/>Exotic Encounters: Compendium is a compilation of all of the exotic encounters products released in 2013, gathered together in a single, convenient, bookmarked document. Buying each of the original Exotic Encounters products separately, this collection of 88 monsters included in this book would cost over $28, but you can get it for almost a third of that price.

When a player is faced with five crying babies, the game is over and the other players score points for all non-crying babies. Every baby has a point value that is known only by the owner of the baby.<br/><br/>To make your life hard in the daycare center, opponents will attach bad cards to your babies so that they become unhappy. At the end of your turn, you have to find a solution for an unhappy baby or he'll start crying. A few things that happen in the game are stolen pacifiers, babies that need a diaper change, and crying babies that receive a toy horn so they can make even more noise. For almost every card played there is a reaction. For example, if an opponent makes your baby nervous, you can play calming music from a mobile, but as a reaction they can break your mobile to keep the baby nervous. You can feed your baby, but your opponents can steal your food...<br/><br/>If you don't have the right cards to keep your babies happy, don't worry. Your colleagues are there to help! During your turn you can trade cards with other players. If you receive the right card in your turn you can still make your babies happy again and prevent them from crying. But be aware your colleagues can also try to trick you by giving a different card as the one they promised!

All of the classic duels fought by these ships are represented in detail. Unlike other age of sail games that focus on fleet actions, Captain&rsquo;s Sea puts you on the deck of a single ship with the responsibility of leading her to victory. You must maneuver against the wind and your opponent to achieve optimum firepower, as well as manage your crew as they scramble to man the guns, work the rigging, and repair battle damage, all while being hammered by the burning shot and flying splinters caused by your enemy. Can you keep your crew in good order or will you be the first to strike the colors?<br/><br/>The action of the game is driven by control of the weather gauge. This is done in a unique fashion by moving ships relative to both the wind and each other, stressing the benefit of position. The ship with the better position has greater flexibility in maneuver as each player predetermines his ship&rsquo;s movement through a simple action selection process that does not require pencil and paper to track. Players must also allocate available crew points (a diminishing commodity as a ship takes damage) to man the guns, rigging, or other actions that the situation might mandate. A deck of action cards provides period flavor and swings of fortune. Throughout a turn, you as captain, are bombarded with difficult decisions that determine the fate of your ship.<br/><br/>Included with the game are ten scenarios, including such classic engagements as the Constellation vs. L&rsquo;Insurgete (9 February 1799), Constitution vs. Guerrier (19 August 1812), and Chesapeake vs. Shannon (1 June 1813). Even those ships that did not fight a major engagement get the opportunity to play out a historical opportunity missed.

This campaign involved the largest number of troops of the war. An inexperienced army faced a very experienced one. It unfolded with an intricate set of maneuvers around New York City and its waterways involving a large British fleet executing numerous amphibious landings in an effort to trap the Colonials. It was truly the best opportunity the British had for capturing Washington and America&rsquo;s entire army. Historically, the Americans just barely escaped to live and fight another day.

The majority of the hexes are open seas, but watch out for obstacles! Sea serpents, giant squid, super volcanoes, ship wrecks, and sand bars all stand in the way of you and your reward.  Navigate through the obstacles by moving in only one direction each turn.  Land on a hex on which a merchant ship lies to capture your booty.  To secure your prize permanently, take the merchant ship to Black Bart's Lagoon.  Be careful to avoid other pirates, as they can steal the ship before you get to Black Bart's Lagoon.  The lagoon, along with the tavern, fortress, and port, are all special hex tiles that serve different purposes in the game.  As you roam the seas, watch out for the navy!  If the naval ship lands on the same hex as you, you are sent back to your home port.<br/><br/>Once a ship is brought to Black Bart's Lagoon and secured, you can either hold on to your booty or invest it in special equipment that could potentially help you commandeer additional ships.

This is perfect for any game where you want your players to experience something similar to an old fashioned dungeon crawl in a fantasy setting.  There are five levels, each one ready for your to populate with your own challenges, traps, and enemies.  The rewards might be great or small, from pre-war technology to vehicles to get your players across the wasteland.  There might be fuel here, or weaponry.  For that matter, your PC's just might find themselves with a nice base of operations if they can clean this place up a bit!<br/><br/>The map levels are as follows:<br/><br/>Map 1 - Ground Level:  A desert wasteland map with four cement bunkers protecting a solitary entrance into the bunker below.  There are concertina wire barricades and trip wires strung, as well as a trench dug around the hill to prevent entrance to the bunker below.  In addition, the cement bunkers are only accessible from inside, and if they are manned, each bunker holds two .50 caliber machine guns, perfect for shredding vehicles or power armored wastelanders that think they deserve access to the bunker's secrets!  Other points of interest include a satellite dish and a radio antenna, which were used by the ancients at one time and may still work if a PC with the right Repair skill happens along.<br/><br/>Map 2 -  Level 1:   This is an early access level, built primarily for defense.  This level is used to access the cement bunkers and deter enemies outside from attempting to enter.  There is also a choke point with two murder holes accessible from level 2 below.  These murder holes are meant as a last line of defense before anyone gains access to the stairwell, or the elevator (if you are going to allow it to be functional).<br/><br/>Map 3 - Level 2:  This is the command center level.  There is an armory, medical bay, robot storage and charging station, as well as a set of jail cells and a security office.  The largest part of this level is the command center though, where ancients monitored several massive screens and watched for enemy activity.  This may have been an intelligence center, or a spy center.  Or it may have been a last chance retreat for soldiers after the bombs fell, and the command center was used to watch the surrounding area for hostiles.  How the command center was used is entirely up to you.  One thing to note is the robot storage room and charging facility.  There are robots missing and these could be guarding the bunker.  Or they could be helpful to your PC's.  The choice is yours.<br/> Map 4 - Level 3:  Living quarters.  This is the part of the bunker were the military personnel lived during their off duty hours.  There is a water treatment facility, as well as a janitorial and maintenance room.  There are more general living quarters as well, such as a mess hall, kitchen, storage, gymnasium, recreation center, education center, film room, bunking quarters, and of course, showers and latrines.  This area has been ransacked.  Either the original denizens went crazy and destroyed themselves and this level, or they were attacked by someone from outside.  Either way, this area is a mess.<br/><br/>Map 5 - Level 4:  Vehicle storage &amp; tram station.  This map covers the very bottom of the bunker.  There is a tram station here that links to other pre-war military bunkers.  Whether or not the tunnels of the tram have collapsed at some point or not is entirely up to you, but at one point this rail system connected to a vast network of other bunkers just like this one.  This particular tram was used for receiving shipments of supplies for the bunker.  There are also several military vehicles in repairable condition, as well as a heavy amount of ordinance for the tanks and artillery.  This level also houses plenty of diesel fuel, as well as the main power source for the entire base.  By this point you may have noticed there aren't a lot of lights on in this bunker.  After several hundred years of neglect and/or overuse, the generators on this level have slowly began to shut down until only one generator remains in operation.  Just enough to supply power to the emergency lighting in the facility and keep the robots on level 2 working.  PC's with enough repair skill may find themselves inheriting a fully functional and well supplied base to operate from if they can get those generators working again!  There is also a tunnel out of this level, meant to imply that the bunker connects to yet another level, most likely a natural cavern that returns to the surface, where the vehicles on this level can be driven out into the wastes.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>     5 Battle Maps for the price of 4!

By manipulating these elements, Elementalists create some of the most spectacular effects of magic, raising walls of stone around themselves or raining fiery death upon their enemies. Unlike practitioners of common magic who barely touch the power of the elements and Priests whose powers come from the Gods, sorcerers master the raw elemental forces without permission and, most of the time, even without acknowledgement.<br/><br/>By enhancing a sword with Fireblade or using Breathe Water, all magic users are elementalists in a way. Their knowledge, however, is limited to the strictly defined spells they learn from their communities, churches and sorcerous orders. Beyond that basic knowledge, there are those who dare a greater understanding of the elements and walk the Four Elemental Ways gaining power over the building blocks of the universe.<br/><br/>Elementalism is the latest volume of the Arcania of Legend series, presenting a new way of looking at elementalism. Designed to slot seamlessly into any fantasy-based Legend game, these sourcebooks enhance and expand the use of magic, adding a new dimension to campaigns. Each Arcania of Legend book is not intended just for Games Masters to use in conjunction with their non-player characters, players themselves will find full details on how to use the magic systems with new or existing characters, greatly increasing the wealth of options the core rulebooks present them with.<br/><br/>"}, "155364": {"rpgdesigner": ["T.

Red Tide West also presumes a wider conflict beyond the scope of the game, but postulates West Germany to be the so-called &ldquo;center of gravity&rdquo; for the entire war. In other words, regardless of what is happening in, say, Scandinavia, or the Balkans, or the Middle East, etc., the presumption here is that the war will be won or lost in central Europe. To wit, if the Red Army cripples NATO and overruns West Germany, it is assumed that diplomatic negotiations will then suddenly become advantageous to both sides. For the Soviets, they would be satisfied to end the war with their substantial gains, not to mention the distinction of being regarded by the world as having won the war, especially if a nuclear exchange had not yet occurred. NATO, on the other hand (and especially the French) would want to end the war before the Red Army rolled into France proper, and certainly before a full-blown nuclear war erupted (or escalated further, if a limited nuclear exchange had already occurred).<br/><br/>On the other side of the coin, if the Red Army&rsquo;s drive into West Germany is halted or thrown back, the war will have run its course then and there, regardless of what is happening elsewhere in the world. Negotiations would be underway, regardless, but the Soviets would have very little to gain (and actually much to lose) by perpetuating a war that is then being perceived as the ultimate reproach of the Soviet state and Communist ideology. Indeed, before Soviet battlefield defeats became prolific and pronounced, and especially before NATO units began to push across the borders of East Bloc countries, the Soviets would be confronted with a choice of trying to negotiate an end to the war before the Warsaw Pact alliance collapsed (or worse, defected&hellip;as if a widespread repeat of the Hungarian Uprising of &lsquo;56), or resort to nuclear strikes to avoid a total defeat (a decidedly undesirable solution when considering NATO&rsquo;s predictable response).<br/><br/>In any case, Red Tide West presumes a short war whereby the final dispositions will be known within a matter of weeks.

With the US in retreat in the world, and the Russians getting overly aggressive, it could be that a resurgent Russia could make an attempt to take back its classic sphere of influence. This, factored in with the fact that Russia is the primary energy source for much of Europe, has made them overly powerful. The biggest threat to the Russian energy dominance is amazingly the country of Poland. Recent technological breakthrough in &lsquo;Fracking&rsquo; has made the Polish shale resources the number one competitor to Russian energy domination. So, once again, the two nations may well be on a collision course to destiny.<br/><br/>The other assumption made for the background of the game is that Germany, caught in the grips of an isolationist government, and not willing to risk rocking the boat with its primary source of energy, declares Poland the aggressor and that it will be neutral in the NATO &ldquo;violation&rdquo;. The US, already weakened from its own internal problems, is unable to force them to honor their commitments.

Each player commands the forces of several different factions, each faction representing a major entity in this particular conflict whose goal was to gain control of as much of Angola as possible while inflicting decisive losses on the enemy. Command control is a critical factor, and the game uses a variant of the &ldquo;Boots&rdquo; system to model this.<br/><br/>Each game turn represents about one month of operations. The map features all of Angola and the adjoining border regions of Southwest Africa and Zaire. The map scale is approximately 31 miles (50 kilometers) across each hexagon; each brigade or regiment represents from about 1,000 to 3,000 men, depending on the army.

Some of the 204 counters represent the infantry and cavalry regiments and artillery batteries used by each player to create forces on the map. Each turn represents six months of real time.<br/><br/>The action is driven by players alternately drawing campaign markers. Most markers enable the drawing player to conduct one or more operations, one operation being (1) moving and fighting with one force, (2) recruiting a unit, or (3) building a fort. Other markers allow the drawing player to control the &quot;wild&quot; Kiowa and Comanche Indians raiding from the west; they represent a danger to both sides and control switches back and forth as the control markers are drawn. The length of a turn is variable and unknown to either player; it ends after two &quot;End&quot; markers have been drawn fromt he campaign marker pool.<br/><br/>Victory is determined by control of the &quot;capital cities&quot; of the Five Civilized Tribes, but the game can end in sudden death if either player loses one of his primary bases.

Human groups range from standard Survivors, Military units, to even outlandish and savage Tribals. These groups will clash with each other in various Confrontation types (scenarios), all the while fending off independent Shambler zombies (classic &quot;walkers&quot; which are neutral, although Virus Strain players can influence their actions). Additionally, players may choose to go on solo or co-op confrontations if they do not enjoy head to head competitive play.<br/><br/>As players go from game to game, they will gain experience and level up characters, add new group members, scavenge loot to barter, sell, or even combine into custom-made gear with the new jury-rigging rules! Powerful groups can get their hands on a vehicle and attempt to get it running, giving themselves a huge advantage both in battle and between games.<br/><br/>Virus Strain players, unlike human ones, do not control a specific group of individuals, but instead control their own unique branch of the zombie pathogen. This manifests itself through mutant &quot;Aberrant&quot; zombies which can be controlled during gameplay, able to become part of any scenario and throw a wrench in the works. Some are pure killing machines, others are more insidious and are geared toward influencing the actions of otherwise mindless Shamblers.

Each player controls a disc and attempts to use it to propel a puck into the opponent's goal.<br/><br/>The control mechanism is unusual - the player controls a crosshair extending from his disc. The location of the cross and the distance it extends from the disc defines how far and in what direction the disc moves when the user presses fire.<br/><br/>Hitting the puck or the opponent's disk will cause them to rebound, so tactics can include positioning your disc in defensive position, knocking the opponent out of the way, along with going for the puck itself.<br/><br/>An additional element to the strategy of the game is a shot timeout limit. After a shot, there are a few seconds (user definable in the menu screen) before another shot can be taken.<br/><br/>After four quarters of play are completed (again, the length of a quarter is user-definable) the player with the most goals wins.<br/><br/>"}, "155425": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Lewis D.

Each player acts as a building contractor who is adding rooms to the castle he's building while also selling his services to other players.<br/><br/>In the game, each player starts with a simple foyer. One player takes on the role of the Master Builder, and that player sets prices for a set of rooms that can be purchased by the other players, with him getting to pick from the leftovers after the other players have paid him for their rooms. When a room is added to a castle, the player who built it gains castle points based on the size and type of room constructed, as well as bonus points based on the location of the room. When a room is completed, with all entranceways leading to other rooms in the castle, the player receives one of seven special rewards.<br/><br/>After each purchasing round, a new player becomes the Master Builder who sets prices for a new set of rooms. After several rounds, the game ends, then additional points are awarded for achieving bonus goals, having the most popular rooms, and being the most responsive to the King's demands, which change each game.

It is a strategic set collecting, memory-based, hand management card game based on controlling and manipulating the supply and demand of various types of cheese from cheese markets throughout North America or Europe.<br/><br/>The European edition of Cheesonomics features cheese from France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands and Scandinavia.  The North American edition of Cheesonomics features cheese from Wisconsin, California, New York, Oregon and Canada.<br/><br/>The overall goal of Cheesonomics is to manage your cheese supply, churn the right colors or animal types from your opponents' hands, produce the market's most demanded colors of cheese to milk the most profit, and earn the most curd cash by selling different colors of cheese at high market prices.<br/><br/>Cheesonomics can be played at three different skill levels - mild, sharp and extra sharp - allowing gamers to adjust the game according to their own playing palate.<br/><br/>Each game starts with three market wheels made up of 5 market wedges, and each player receives five cheese wedges and a cheese knife marked with either cheddar, edam, feta, gouda or parmesan.<br/><br/>On each turn, the active player begins by retrieving his cheese knife from the serving tray - if it was placed there on a previous turn - and then chooses one of three different culinary actions: Churn Cheese, Produce Cheese or Sell Cheese.<br/><br/>Churning cheese allows a player to collect cheese wedges from opponents. When churning, the active player asks for one color or animal type. The colors are red, orange, yellow, green or blue, and animals are cow, sheep, goat, yak, and reindeer. If an opponent has that type of cheese card, he must give the active player one card of that type. If he does not have that card type, the opponent must show his hand and give the active player one wedge of the active player's choice.<br/><br/>The active player then protects his product by placing his cheese knife over that color or animal type on the provided serving tray. No other player can churn for that type of cheese until the knife is removed on that player's next turn.<br/><br/>Instead of Churning, a player could Produce cheese.  To do this, the active player simply plays all cheese wedges of one color or animal type from his hand face up onto the table into a cheese wheel. These wedges will be available for sale in future turns. The player then draws cheese wedges until he has five total wedges in his hand.<br/><br/>Instead of Churning or Producing cheese, the active player could Sell Cheese. To sell, a player chooses up to three wedges of one color or animal type from previously-formed cheese and gains curd cash depending on the market, which is the sum of face-up, matching color market wedges.<br/><br/>After selling cheese, the active player now &quot;Mooves&quot; the market, choosing one market wedge representing the color of the cheese sold in the transaction and flipping that wedge to the opposite side.<br/><br/>The game ends when the cheese wedge draw pile is exhausted during a player's turn. The cheesemonger who has the most curd cash is the cheesy champion!<br/><br/>Cheesonomics has even more to offer players who wish to try out the Sharp and Extra Sharp flavors of the game.<br/><br/>In the Sharp game, players can now further manipulate the market. Whenever a Sell Cheese action is taken, that player now also chooses a wedge in the market to completely replace with one from his personal supply of market wedges.<br/><br/>There are also certain cheese wedges with market symbols that may be activated during a Sell Cheese action that can allow a player to discard one of their market wedges and gain another or give a market wedge to one of the other players and take one of theirs.<br/><br/>The Extra Sharp game is for the truly adventurous Cheeseheads!  As an expansion to Cheesonomics, players can add in the Extra Sharp cheese wedge cards that introduce growth hormone, organic and smelly cheese wedges. Each of these new cheese wedge types have special rules that affect a Sell Cheese action, allowing players the choice to boost their production with growth hormones, earn more curds at game end with quality organic cheeses, or use pungent aromas to prevent players from flipping or removing market wedges.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition (European)", "English first edition (North American)"], "average": "6.10761", "name": "Cheesonomics", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Memory", "Press Your Luck", "Set Collection", "Take That"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "46", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Food / Cooking", "Gryphon Family Games series"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["MN 0019 Cheesonomics and Dale Tolley Interview"]}, "155485": {"poll": [], "name": "Reel Fishing II", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European PlayStation edition", "Japanese PlayStation edition", "North American PlayStation edition", "PSN PSOne Classics edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Reel Fishing"], "videogametheme": ["Fishing"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Open Sesame"], "videogamegenre": ["Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation", "PlayStation 3", "PlayStation Vita", "PSP"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Marvelous Entertainment", "Natsume", "Victor Interactive Software"], "description": "Reel Fishing II (known as Fish Eyes II in Japan) is the final Reel Fishing game on the PlayStation.

The four Care Bear cards each have a letter associated with them (B, E, A, and R).  The remaining cards are shuffled and distributed to the players.  Youngest player goes first and play proceeds clockwise.<br/><br/>Players take turns revealing cards from their stacks in a forward motion.  When a card is revealed, the players vie to slap the corresponding Care Bear card in the center of the table.  Whoever does so first claims the card they slapped.  If two players slap at the same time, whoever covers more of the card with their hand claims the card.  The claimed card is replaced by the one that was revealed.<br/><br/>The first player to collect cards that spell BEAR wins (i.e., a set of the four different Care Bear cards).  For a more challenging game, the rules recommend a variant where incorrect slaps result in the player losing a previously collected card.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "4", "name": "Care Bears: Spell BEAR!", "playingtime": "10", "boardgamemechanic": ["Set Collection"], "average": "3", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Bears", "Care Bears"]}}
