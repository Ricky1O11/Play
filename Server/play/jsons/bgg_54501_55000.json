Sure, the city has a history of attracting criminal groups, corrupt merchants, and politicians&mdash;to say nothing of subversive cults dedicated to insane and dreadful gods&mdash;but it's the pirates who infest the city and prowl the Serpent's Teeth that give the City of Adventure its dubious reputation. From its first founding as a haven for buccaneers and cutthroats, established on the pirate's code to attain an uneasy peace between voyages, Freeport has evolved from a filthy little town to a sprawling city of thousands. Yet in that time, pirates remain the most common and most popular of its citizens.<br/><br/>Buccaneers of Freeport returns to Freeport's roots and examines the colorful and disturbing rogues that roam the seas around the City of Adventure. Describing eight pirates, many new, some infamous, in lavish detail, each entry explores the rogue's history, his or her goals and agendas, while hinting at the curse that keeps them at sea and the treasures they guard. In addition, the pirate's key crewmen receive extensive attention, presenting them in all their cunning and brutality to breathe life into the thrill-seeking corsairs. Finally, the pirate ship, allies, and enemies round out the chapter, culminating with a campaign framework to help you build adventures centered on these various characters.<br/><br/>The buccaneers described in this sourcebook include:<br/><br/><br/>     Three Sheets Kimbal: An adventurous and courageous corsair famed for his curious relationship with Lady Luck.<br/>     Scarbelly: The dread orc captain of the Bloody Vengeance, despised and feared by all for his brutality and viciousness.<br/>     Alfhild: A renegade warrior-maiden turned pirate to escape an arranged marriage and the duties of her homeland.<br/>     Flynn the Quick: An ambitious privateer that seeks redemption by wiping out piracy in all its forms.<br/>     Get o' Yarash: A disturbing ship filled with crude and violent mutants and exiles dedicated to the bloodthirsty god Yarash.<br/>     Aesha Algosi&eacute;l: A beautiful but cruel elf maiden who scours the seas for lost relics of occult power.<br/>     Xian-Lei: Driven by vengeance and saddled with a dreadful curse, Xian-Lei prowls the seas waging war on those he blames for the death of his order.<br/>     Scevola Hest: Cursed to sail the seas for all time on the ghostly vessel named the Black Contessa, Hest and his spectral crew strike against any they please.<br/><br/><br/>Buccaneers of Freeport is a game sourcebook designed for all roleplaying games. Free from mechanics, its contents can be adapted for Green Ronin's True20 Adventure Roleplaying or any other popular RPG, ensuring this sourcebook is useful no matter what campaign setting or game system you use. Francisco and Drac may have planned great things for Freeport, but the City of Adventure has always been and shall ever be the port of call for pirates around the world.

So, can you find the right balance between the ferocious partisan war of the wilderness and the more &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; style of war as practiced in Europe?  If so, then perhaps the Marquis de Montcalm, with his French battalions, can stave off his more numerous enemies to the south; perhaps New France can survive the tempest of war.<br/><br/>As the English, you, too, have a difficult &ldquo;balancing&rdquo; act to master; you must find a way to placate and protect your fiercely independent, but extremely valuable Colonials.  Without their numbers and forest craft, you stand little chance of besting the potent combination of &ldquo;unmitigated savages&rdquo; from the Lakes, Mission Indians from the St. Lawrence Valley, Canadian bush rangers, and French battalions which will be coming at you in waves.  Ask too much of the Americans; do too little on their behalf; treat them with disrespect; they will turn a deaf ear to your entreaties and allow the British Regulars to march off to certain defeat out there, at the hands of a foe who is covered &ldquo;by the universal forest.&rdquo;<br/><br/>And, facing both of you, is &ldquo;an immense uninhabited wilderness, overgrown everywhere with trees and brushwood, so that nowhere can one see twenty yards.&rdquo;  This vast, uncharted forest dominates the struggle.

If the characters wish to survive they have to do it themselves by escaping to the outskirts of the town.<br/><br/>In Posthumous, half the players will command a single cliche character apiece, while the other half direct hordes of themed zombies. The town's layout, characters' and zombies strengths and weaknesses are all randomized each game, making every play through a distinguished experience. While on the surface, Posthumous's humor celebrates the proud history of the Zombie Flick, the game is at its core one of cunning and tactical use of your entire team's abilities.<br/><br/>Posthumous's unique mechanics reduce downtime and keep the players plotting, laughing, and guessing.

That's all in a day's work for the Meddling Kids!<br/><br/>Meddling Kids is a role-playing game aimed at players from ages 7 and up, and perfect for everyone. Designed and written to be easily understood, Meddling Kids uses its own unique game system -- The Starter System -- that is planned as a springboard to other, more involved gaming systems. And each adventure should take less than an hour each to play, making it easy for young minds to stay focused.<br/><br/>The theme of the game is simple: a group of kids and their anthropomorphic sidekick friend -- what we call The Wild Card -- have to solve mysteries and save the day. You've seen this model before in countless television series where kids team up with a talking animal, a talking car, an unfrozen caveman, or anything that you can imagine. The players take the roles of the kids and the gamemaster assumes the role of the Wild Card to make sure that the adventure goes the right way. And when the time comes, there are rules for setting a trap to catch the bad guy and solve the mystery.<br/><br/>Jump right into the fun and get the youngest kids started down the path of a great hobby right now! Meddling Kids are here to save the day!<br/><br/>"}, "54641": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic591306.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Elisabeth Draxler", "Katharina Poteranski", "Herta Strehl", "Sonja Trausmuth"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Robert Bayer"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Piatnik"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic591306_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Educational"], "boardgamehonor": ["2009 Spiel der Spiele Hit f\u00fcr Kinder Recommended"], "description": "From the publisher: Players attend the Clown School &ldquo;Grimassimix&rdquo;, where making faces is subject matter instead of maths and languages &ndash; to the student&rsquo;s delight.

Dust swirls around a crimson sun, reminding every one of their possible success, telling them of their mortality. Settlers make a grab for the fertile land, destroying whatever does not fit their ideal.<br/><br/>Prospectors are raping the hills for precious metals; dumping their waste in the fresh, clear rivers. Trappers slaughter vast herds of buffalo for their valuable pelts, leaving a wake of rotting carcasses, a mountain of bone and skulls. The Law can barely cope, as lynch mobs leave cadavers hanging from the trees.<br/><br/>The Redskins fight for their very existence, caught between death and degradation. The old powers cannot compete with the new power from the East. The wise have begun to abandon hope; the young still believe they have a chance to even the score.<br/><br/>The people drag a living from the land of dreams but everything is not always as it seems. Ancient mysteries are discovered as the white man slowly conquers this strange new world, mysteries that they are not prepared for.<br/><br/>Aces High is a deadly supplement for the Basic Roleplaying game. Firearms are very common, it would be considered unusual if your character did not have a firearm of some description. Healing is generally restricted to First Aid and Medicine delivered by a Doctor. Other than that, only natural healing can be relied upon, and that is slow. If your character is involved in a shoot-out you should expect swift and bloody death from all directions.<br/><br/>"}, "54646": {"rpgdesigner": ["Wolfgang Baur", "Jason Bulmahn", "Joshua J.

Schwalb: A Scales of War Adventure Path adventure. This short adventure bridges the gap between the heroic and paragon tiers of play for your Scales of War campaign if your PCs aren&rsquo;t quite 11th level. The Cult of Exquisite Agony&mdash;a cabal of insane devotees of the Far Realms&mdash;has grown in power recently, spurred on by a local sect popping up almost overnight in Overlook. Now the cult is looking to expand its sphere of influence, using the recent chaos in the city as a springboard for their own agenda. An adventure for 10th-level PCs.<br/><br/>WINTER OF THE WITCH By Stephen Radney-MacFarland: In this epic adventure, the Winter Witch&mdash;a legendary archfey&mdash;has launched a campaign to send eternal winter cascading over large portions of the world. After a summons to Winterhaven, the characters find a land locked in ice, and an old ally in need of aid. A trek to find a artifact known as the Sun&rsquo;s Sliver ensues, the only force potent enough to defeat the Winter Witch and banish her from the mortal world once more. An adventure for 22nd-level PCs.<br/><br/>DEPTHS OF MADNESS By Robert J. Schwalb: The Madness trilogy continues with &ldquo;Depths of Madness.&rdquo; After saving the town of Wellspring, the heroes find that their efforts have not stopped the assault on the town. A new threat has emerged, seeking to capitalize on the re-emergence of the Tear of Ioun. The heroes must seize the Tear and defeat this threat, or the entire region could be swallowed by chaos.

They have existed for eons. The countless worlds of the Great Beyond are their playgrounds and battlefields. Yet for all their vast power, it is not the gods of Golarion who shape nations and write history&mdash;this task falls instead to their greatest creations: the mortal races of the world. It is through their priests and paladins, their clerics and cultists that the gods make their will known in this world, be it for good or ill.<br/><br/>In Gods and Magic, you will learn not only of the core twenty deities of the Pathfinder Chronicles campaign setting, but of a multitude of other deities whose flocks, while smaller and more isolated, have just as much potential for greatness. Yet this book isn&rsquo;t just for clerics&mdash;religion and faith are important factors in the lives of many, be they stalwart paladins, brave rangers, mysterious druids, or dedicated monks. Even those whose talents lie beyond the divine, such as the scholarly wizard or the god-fearing barbarian, find that faith has its advantages.<br/><br/>Within the pages of this book you will find:<br/><br/>     Detailed descriptions of the core twenty deities of the Pathfinder Chronicles campaign setting, complete with symbol and deity illustrations.<br/>     Details on over 40 additional deities, including the gods of dwarves and elves, gnomes and halflings, giants and dragons, and more!<br/>     Over 20 new spells associated with the most powerful religions, yet usable by both arcane and divine spellcasters.<br/>     Dozens of new magic items keyed to the world&rsquo;s religions, ranging from minor trinkets to powerful artifacts.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "54742": {"rpgartist": ["Claus D.

The PDF rulebook is available for free download. The game consists of four pages of rules and a double-sided set of character sheets.<br/><br/>From a rough automated translation of the rules introduction:<br/><br/>&quot;For the first time in over six hundred years, there is an uncertain peace in continent Latvari. The two rivals Hohenstahl and Novrikia have put down their arms after a ten-year long destructive war. Both sides agreed that it had gone too far when their Orkish mercenaries were beginning to run riot in eastern Latvari, and decided therefore to a cease-fire and freeze of the front lines. For the first time in six hundred years guns, rifles and machine guns are silent.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Although neither side can afford to keep their armies in the field of peace and the majority of armies have been released, air fleets still patrol borders, oceans and colonies. In particular the old enemies Hohenstahl and Novrikia keep an eye on each other. The new air guns also have been released, which has put a bit of problem for the young, brave and noble pilots now have nothing to do. They entertain themselves instead of all sorts pastime as flight contests different kinds, and hits on flight clubs, hunting castle and other places of society, where they can abreact itself. It is also an excellent place for spies and agents to intermingle, and the center for the eternal intrigue in the social upper circuits. And there are plenty of both: in the fragile peace so is to provide gain as much advantage as possible.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;But there are concerns. Novrikia and Hohenstahl have not been released on garden, and both are looking for an excuse and an opportunity to fly at each other again. Elves and Dwarves think, as usual, not on each other. Kerosene depots are vital for all who want an air fleet or air force, and without air fleet and air force we have nothing to set against an enemy who has them. Kerosene is used to operate most aircraft, from Dwarven rockets to Orkish pulse jet engines and the usual aircraft. Even the large magnetic air battleship machines are powered by kerosene, but they can also be powered by conventional coal-fired steam turbines. Only the Elven flight beasts are not propelled by kerosene  - they eat meat instead. For all others, kerosene is a constant object for quarrels and fights.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The rumor that Eastern Orcs, dangerous, brutal and more skilled than their cousins in the West, have their own plans. Rumors say an evil to the east is being awakened again after six hundred years of rest.&quot; <br/> &quot;It is at this time, in 1906 in the Fourth Age, which our story takes its beginning.&quot;<br/><br/>And the original Swedish rules introduction:<br/><br/>F&ouml;r f&ouml;rsta g&aring;ngen p&aring; &ouml;ver sexhundra &aring;r s&aring; r&aring;der en os&auml;ker fred p&aring; kontinenten Latvari. De b&aring;da rivalerna Hohenstahl och Novrikia har lagt ner vapnen efter ett tio &aring;r l&aring;ngt och destruktivt krig. B&aring;da sidorna kom &ouml;verens om att det hade g&aring;tt f&ouml;r l&aring;ngt n&auml;r deras orchiska legosoldater hade b&ouml;rjar h&auml;rja i &ouml;stra Latvari, och beslutade sig d&auml;rf&ouml;r f&ouml;r att utlysa eld upph&ouml;r och frysa gr&auml;nserna vid d&aring;varande linjer. F&ouml;r f&ouml;rsta g&aring;ngen p&aring; sexhundra &aring;r s&aring; &auml;r kanonerna, gev&auml;ren och kulsprutorna tysta.<br/><br/>&Auml;ven om ingen sida har r&aring;d att h&aring;lla sina arm&eacute;er i f&auml;lt i fredstid och majoriteten av h&auml;rarna har hemf&ouml;rlovats s&aring; patrullerar fortfarande luftflottorna gr&auml;nserna, haven och kolonierna. I synnerhet de gamla fienderna Hohenstahl och Novrikia h&aring;ller &ouml;gonen p&aring; varandra. De nya flygvapnen har ocks&aring; hemf&ouml;rlovats, vilket har st&auml;llt till lite problem f&ouml;r de unga, modiga och adliga piloterna som nu inte har n&aring;gonting att g&ouml;ra. Dessa roar sig ist&auml;llet med allehanda tidsf&ouml;rdriv som flygt&auml;vlingar av olika slag och tr&auml;ffar p&aring; flygklubbar, jaktslott och andra societetsst&auml;llen, d&auml;r de kan avreagera sig. Det &auml;r ocks&aring; ett ypperligt st&auml;lle f&ouml;r spioner och agenter att beblanda sig, och centrum f&ouml;r eviga intriger i de sociala &ouml;vre kretsarna. Och det finns gott om b&aring;da: i den br&auml;ckliga freden s&aring; g&auml;ller det att tillf&ouml;rskaffa sig s&aring; mycket f&ouml;rdelar som m&ouml;jligt.<br/><br/>Men det finns orosmoln. Novrikia och Hohenstahl har inte sl&auml;ppt p&aring; garden, och b&aring;da letar efter en urs&auml;kt och en m&ouml;jlighet att flyga p&aring; varandra igen. Alver och dv&auml;rgar tycker som vanligt inte om varandra. Kerosindep&aring;er &auml;r livsviktiga f&ouml;r alla som vill ha en luftflotta eller ett flygvapen, och utan luftflotta och flygvapen s&aring; har man ingenting att s&auml;tta emot en fiende som har dem. Kerosin anv&auml;nds f&ouml;r att driva det mesta, fr&aring;n dv&auml;rgiska raketer till orchiska pulsjetmotorer och vanliga flygplan. Till och med de stora luftslagskeppens magnetiska maskiner drivs av kerosin, men de kan &auml;ven drivas av vanliga koleldade &aring;ngturbiner. Det &auml;r i princip bara alvernas flygbestar som inte drivs av kerosin &ndash; de &auml;ter k&ouml;tt ist&auml;llet. F&ouml;r alla andra s&aring; &auml;r kerosin ett konstant f&ouml;rem&aring;l f&ouml;r os&auml;mja och br&aring;k.<br/><br/>Det ryktas om att ostorcherna, farligare, grymmare och mer kompetenta &auml;n deras kusiner i v&auml;st, har sina egna planer. Det ryktas om en ondska i &ouml;ster som h&aring;ller p&aring; att vakna till liv igen efter sexhundra &aring;rs vila.<br/><br/>Det &auml;r i denna tid, &aring;r 1906 i Fj&auml;rde &aring;ldern, som v&aring;r saga tar sin b&ouml;rjan.<br/><br/>"}, "54959": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Miles Ratcliffe"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Judgment", "playingtime": "150", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Role Playing"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic588964_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Miles Ratcliffe"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unpublished)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic588964.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "150", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Fantasy"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "150", "description": "Judgment is a board game created by Miles Ratcliffe and, although some thought by Chaos Publishing Ltd. has been put into to publishing the game, it is not due to be published any time soon.<br/><br/>'Prepare to step into a whole new fantasy world full of magic and adventure as you battle your way through your quests like never before.<br/><br/>On a distant world, far from our reach, there was land full of magic and prosperity; where the just had ruled over the corrupt for many a millennia.

Some of them have hobbies that keep them busy, while others just stare at the ceiling.<br/><br/>Jhonen Vasquez&rsquo; comic Jhonny The Homicidal Maniac probably played into this a little bit too, especially with the imaginary friends. Anyway, this game is a &ldquo;solo RPG,&rdquo; which admittedly is kind of an oxymoron. But I figured that if I&rsquo;m going to make a game about antisocial shut-ins, it ought to be a game you could play by yourself. In this game you&rsquo;ll be rolling dice (you&rsquo;ll need plenty of ten-sided dice) and following instructions to generate events, making some choices about those and rolling a few more dice, and then writing a fictional diary entry based on the results. Out of necessity it&rsquo;s not as open-ended as a normal RPG, but then it&rsquo;s mostly a writing exercise. You can write on paper, type them up, or put them in a blog. Needless to say I&rsquo;m curious what the results will be like, but you can do whatever you want with them.<br/><br/>By default, the game ends after your character goes through seven unusually eventful days. One of the ways in which it&rsquo;s like a typical RPG is that there isn&rsquo;t any particular way to &ldquo;win.&rdquo; If you want your character to get out of his rut and rejoin society, or stay the same, or kill himself, or whatever, you can try to steer him that way, but a lot of stuff will come down to how the dice fall. The real game is turning all this nonsense into coherent writing.<br/><br/>"}, "54972": {"rpgdesigner": ["John C. Bunnell", "Lisa Cabala", "Harold Dolan", "Richard W.
