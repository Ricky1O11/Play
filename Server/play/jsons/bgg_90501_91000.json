The masks are beginning to slip, to be discovered, to expose things below.<br/><br/>You shall portray a persona born of this world, one who has crafted their own mask or who has used the masks others have made for them. Or you might be a seeker, one who wishes to know what lies behind the masks and believes that their mind, spirit and body strong enough to face what lies behind the mask. Once you begin the journey there is no turning back, though you may find yourself having wandered onto the wrong path and going someplace you never expected. This is the price for being who you are, of knowing, imagining, acting and choosing.<br/><br/>This is not the world you live in, it&rsquo;s the world of your persona, your character, which you have gathered together using the Cosmic Synchronicity rules and the additional information to be found in this book. It&rsquo;s not necessarily the same future your world faces, nor are things exactly the same as you your are expecting. Its an alternative Earth, similar yet different in ways both subtle and obvious. This book cannot tell you everything, if it did it would be an encyclopedia. Your GM will add details beyond here, we simply deal with the over view and those details needed for the creation of your character.<br/><br/>The first part of the book will deal with the world, the second part will deal with those mechanical things needed for your character creation process. Its recommended you at least skim thru the first part before getting to the creation process so that your character will fit better into the scheme of things (or stand in opposition to them, if you wish).<br/><br/>This is NOT a complete work - GMs and players must place effort into making this setting come alive.

All hope is not lost,however. As the trees are wounded by the Harpies as part of their torment, they are granted the ability to speak, and tell the stories of how they came to take their own lives, and land themselves in such a lamentable situation. Although it is not often mentioned (for obvious reasons), this infernal torture is not always eternal, some fortunate souls may, though introspection and atonement, cast off their worldly sins,and ascend to one of the Heavenly Spheres, to bask in the presence of God for the rest of eternity.<br/><br/>This task is not easy as one might imagine at the outset. The chance at salvation carries with it certain responsibilities and risks. Firstly, no soul may attempt to redeem itself alone when they are ready, a set number of damned souls are chosen, and given the opportunity to purge themselves of their Woe, and of the sins that brought about their fall. These souls are bound to one another, and may not leave the company of their fellow aspirants, lest they bring about the damnation of them all. Additionally, salvation is not assured. It is possible that this clutch of souls may fail at their task, and condemn one or more of their company to return to their punishment as a wounded tree for some indeterminate period of time, perhaps they will receive another opportunity to save themselves from eternal torment, perhaps this was their last hope, and they will never see grace again.<br/><br/>"}, "90510": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal", "Wolsung: Magia Wieku Pary"], "statistics": [], "name": "Wolsung: karty do gry", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1201471.jpg", "usersrated": "4", "rpgitemversion": ["Talia czarna", "Talia czerwona"], "average": "7.75", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Pulp)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Ku\u017ania Gier"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1201471_t.jpg", "description": "user summary<br/><br/>As Wolsung is actively using cards as part of its mechanic, there are also &quot;wolsungish&quot; cards (standard set of 52 cards + 3 jokers in standard size).<br/><br/>Availible red and black sets.<br/><br/>Talia czarna is the BLACK deck.<br/>Talia czerwona is the RED deck.<br/><br/>"}, "90511": {"poll": [], "name": "Sparta 301", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iPhone edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Ancient History", "Fantasy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["EasyTech"], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["iPhone"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["EasyTech"], "description": "The second Persian invasion of Greece (480-479 BC) occurred during the Greco-Persian Wars, as King Xerxes of Persia sought to conquer all of Greece.

Upon meeting Yzma, he must race for the potion.<br/><br/>There are also many secrets to be found within the game, each with something that would help Kuzco get Gold Coins.<br/><br/>Throughout the game there are many silver and gold colored coins lying around, which Kuzco must pick up in order to get his Gold Coin (earned by getting all the coins in a single level).

Martian Gothic) is a survival horror game for the PlayStation and PC. It was developed by Creative Reality and published by Take-Two Interactive. Programmers Neil Dodwell and Martin Wong, designer Stephen Marley, animator David Dew, modelers Julian Holtom and Paul Oglesby, and music &amp; sound effects by Jeremy Taylor.<br/><br/>A unique feature of this game is that if any of the characters meet face to face, the bacteria that has infected them draw all three characters into a 'Trimorph' at which point of the game is lost. Because the characters cannot meet face-to-face, they can trade items using a system of &quot;Vac Tubes,&quot; which can transport 4 items to other Vac Tubes at a time. Also, when the player needs to leave an item behind, she/he may do so by leaving the relevant item into various hatches, which can hold up to 4-6 items. Using the hatches may leave the player confused about where she/he left the item, but the player can use any in-game computer to bring up a list of the contents of every hatch, including ones that have not been accessed yet. In order for the character to unravel the events before their arrival, they may search dead bodies for letters or micro-recorders which may contain information about the character, plot, passwords, and the method in which they might have died. Many recordings have been stored on some of the base's computers, which also contain information about the person or the storyline, to provide information that can further the player's progress through the game setting.<br/><br/>In terms of player control, Martian Gothic is very similar to the early Resident Evil game titles: the Vac Tubes function the same way as Item Boxes, and the control of the characters and the camera angles are almost identical (often called the 'Character Turret' or 'Tank' system of control).<br/><br/>Setting<br/>In Martian Gothic, the player is able to assume the roles of three characters sent from Earth to a Martian base called Vita 1 to examine why it has been silent for 10 months, after a base member broadcasts a final message of &quot;Stay alone, stay alive.&quot; Upon arrival the player finds that all the residents are apparently dead and must gradually uncover the secrets and nature the last undertaking by Vita 1's crew; the discovery of ancient Martian &quot;Pandora's Box&quot; which, when opened, started a chain of chaotic events that led to the base's downfall, and death of all almost its inhabitants. However, during the player's progress of uncovering the truth, searching for any possible survivors, and solving Vita 1's many mounting problems, the player finds that the dead crew have become re-animated like zombies who wish to feast upon the team of three's flesh.<br/><br/>The Vita 1 base was constructed in 2009 by the Allenby Corporation, implied to be Earth's most powerful megacorporation, to research potential alien life from microfossils on Mars, after discovering in 1996 that a Martian meteorite found in 1984 contains ancient bacteria which had crashed in Antarctica in 11,000 BC. Vita 1 is situated very close to Olympus Mons which can be partially visited by the player upon access to the underground &quot;Necropolis&quot; zone - the human-excavated ruins of an old Martian city - of Vita 1.<br/><br/>The Allenby Corporation has sent a group of three members to its Vita 1 via spacecraft which crash-lands just outside Vita 1's airlock entries, to investigate the ten-month-long radio silence. This investigative team consists of Kenzo Uji, an infomesh expert ('infomesh' being an in-game term relating to human-computer virtual interface) who describes himself as a &quot;techno-zen hippy;&quot; Martin Karne, the security escort of the team who volunteered for the mission; and Diane Matlock, a scientist who has friends in Vita 1. These three characters are controlled by the player. However, other non-player-controlled characters are encountered such as MOOD, the main computer of Vita 1 who has her own personality; Ben Gunn, the only living survivor of Vita 1's outbreak, who is shown to be possibly insane; and Judith Halloway, the Vita 1 project director, who was last person to contact Earth with the final message &quot;Stay alone, stay alive.&quot;<br/><br/>Taking place on June 17 of 2019, ten months after Vita 1's last contact to Earth with the message &quot;stay alone, stay alive&quot; on August 8 of 2018, the investigative team of Kenzo Uji, Martin Karne, and Diane Matlock approach Vita 1 on Mars in their nutshell-shaped spacecraft. Vita 1's main computer MOOD claims to sense their arrival, and know &quot;each name, each individual pain&quot; of the arriving three. Whilst Kenzo, as pilot of the spacecraft, is forced to make a crash landing on the Martian surface and it's crew depart into different airlocks of Vita 1 base, MOOD apathetically predicts that, although three have entered, only two will leave alive. Now separated into different airlocks, the three simultaneously record logs onto audio recorders, and using radio's from spacesuits in their respective airlocks, make verbal contact with each other to make sure everyone is alright. All three go through decontamination, but each notes something is &quot;wrong, something very wrong&quot; concerning the decontamination gas they are exposed to.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Martian Gothic: Unification,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "90525": {"poll": [], "name": "ReBoot", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA PlayStation edition", "UK PlayStation edition"], "average": "1", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon", "Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Electronic Arts (EA)"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure", "Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Electronic Arts (EA)"], "description": "ReBoot is a video game based on the television show of the same name.

What would the dream of a Greater Germany have been without Austria, Czechoslovakia, and the other German territorial claims? Would the Western plutocrats or the Soviet colossus have fought the fascist dictatorship anyway and nevertheless inexorably triggered global conflict?<br/><br/>Democracy under Siege is an interactive simulation enabling you to explore all such questions. A card-driven strategy game, it reproduces the geopolitical conflicts and political struggles that led to the Second World War. The game covers the period 1933-1940 and is designed for two or three players. Each takes the role of one of the three ideologies &mdash; Democracy, Nazism and Communism &mdash; that struggled for power during the timeline of the game. (When played by two players, the two Ideologies exclusively under player control are Democracy and Nazism, while control of Communism alternates between the two players from turn to turn according to specific rules.)<br/><br/>Each game turn represents one year and is divided into three or four rounds. Players choose one political action and one event per round and attempt to perform the political action by rolling a die and applying some modifiers. They can affect the outcomes of their attempts by expending the ideology's political prestige. Events are activated immediately before the political actions are attempted; no die roll is required. If the political action succeeds, the card effects are applied accordingly. In any case, even when the attempt is unsuccessful, the political action cards played provide a varying number of political points (PP) that can later be expended by the players to perform activities.<br/><br/>After political actions, players perform their action round with the PP provided by political action cards. Players can influence the political allegiance of minor countries, exploit the economic resources belonging either to minor nations or to their controlled powers, recruit and activate coup cells to attempt coups d'etat to overthrow a minor country regime, send military forces to local conflicts or intervene in a civil war in a minor nation. All of these activities, as well as the effects of successful political actions, can bring victory points (VP) when the political allegiances of minor countries come under the influence or the control of Ideologies, or when territories or nations are conquered.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, players check the outcomes of coup attempts, then proceed to a new round. During the clean-up phase at the end of each turn, players perform end-turn checks and calculate the production of military resources (MR) by the exploitation of economic resources claimed on the map. MR are put in the ideologies' force pool and expended to maintain the minor nations allegiances. The remaining MR provide additional VP and can be employed during the subsequent turns to intervene in local conflicts and civil wars.<br/><br/>Democracy under Siege offers an accurate and detailed historical context, supported by 108 strategy cards. Players exploit historical events and political actions to achieve political supremacy. Wars are simulated by an abstract combat system that allows players to intervene and influence their outcomes. The main concepts reproduced in the game are the ideological struggles among the major powers, the race for armaments ahead of World War II and the buildup of a network of diplomatic links with minor nations. All of these elements combine to determine victory.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["4Dados edition", "Print & Play edition", "The Game Crafter edition"], "name": "Democracy under Siege", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Area Control / Area Influence", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven"], "average": "7.625", "usersrated": "16", "age": "12", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["HLG 10: Meer Essen"]}, "90570": {"poll": [], "name": "Scarlett and the Spark of Life: Scarlett Adventures Episode 1", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iPhone edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic896338.png", "videogametheme": ["Comedy", "Comics", "Fantasy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Launching Pad Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["iPhone"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Launching Pad Games"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic896338_t.png", "description": "Kidnapped?

First and foremost, it takes the 15-page campaign model presented in the core rules and transforms it into a full-fledged roleplaying world. URBAN ARCANA provides details on the history, denizens, and fantastic aspects of a world that would be very similar to our own if monsters roamed the sewers, magic was real, and your neighbors included elves, dwarves, and other familiar fantasy races.<br/><br/>Just as importantly, URBAN ARCANA adds several new aspects to the d20 MODERN rules. Here you can find new advanced classes, equipment, spells, creatures, and NPCs that can enhance any d20 MODERN game, whether or not it is based in the URBAN ARCANA setting.<br/><br/>URBAN ARCANA also introduces a concept that is already familiar to players of DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS and other d20 system games - prestige classes. In fact, we found ourselves so inspired by the possibilities for different character archetypes that we soon had more prestige classes than we could possibly fit into the allotted space in the book. Rather than let the extras languish, we decided to offer them as a web enhancement.<br/><br/>Like those presented in the URBAN ARCANA book, the following prestige classes have requirements that are more restrictive than those for advanced classes, reflecting far deeper specialization.

Without warning or reason they fell upon the defenceless Fey, killing mercilessly.<br/>        Many races sent aid to the gentle Fairy-Folk, but were sent only to their death. The invaders brought might and fury unseen in our system, with relentless slaughter of all who apposed.<br/>        They were the Daemons of legend whose coming was foretold by Gaeokerena himself at the dawn of our birth. There were lesser races that warned us of their power, none more so than the Reptilians, but in our pride we did not listen. We had become complacent in our eternal lives and were unprepared for their invasion. Many of our kind fell in the fire and destruction they left in their wake.<br/>        Within a month the Fey had been scattered, forced to hide away in the darkest regions of their own land and for the first time in over ten thousand years we ourselves were forced into retreat to reconsider our strategy. The enemy had no fear, no care for their losses, and were resilient to our greatest magic.<br/>        With their first victory the Daemons turned their vile intentions to Lupa, the realm of the Canis. Here the &lsquo;Moon Worshippers&rsquo; fought valiantly for two years, never giving quarter to their enemy. Many perished on both sides and yet the Daemons continued their onslaught. Then, without cause, they stopped, returning to their new homeland.<br/>        We know now that we have those outside our world to thank, for they closed the doorway to Gaeo, prevented the arrival of more daemon-kin. However, the daemons are not without leadership and have sought aid from others in their conquest.<br/>        The Daemons have now allied themselves with our everlasting enemies, the Druge, and together they have brought a new struggle to our world.<br/>        It is not only a war of arms, but also of subterfuge and fragile alliances.

Tricks can be performed which earn bonus points. Grand Prix is a simulation-style season mode similar to Gran Turismo&rsquo;s Career Mode. Players can compete in a number of different races around the world to earn points toward the leaderboard in the Grand Prix.<br/><br/>The game ships with ten licensed tracks from the 2001 season and over 30 racers.

An armed conflict ensued as each race was determined to capture the planet for its own purposes. To avoid an intergalactic war, as well as to prevent the disputed planet from being accidentally destroyed by the space fleets battling around it, a treaty called The Compact of Gallius IV was signed by seven of the eight races. Each of the seven would deploy five hundred lightly armed colonists to the planet, who would then each begin developing a colony. No restrictions were put on weapons developed and used by the colonies, as opposed to the colonists only being allowed to bring laser pistols with them. The colony to drive all others off the planet's surface, or to construct a pre-set number of cities, would claim the planet for its leaders. The recently discovered and neutral Tolnans serve as advisers to everyone, while the Skirineen operate the local black market.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/>The game can be played against a number of human opponents (over the Internet), or against the computer. Before starting, the player picks one of seven races to lead, modifies the desired size of the planet, its basic geological make-up, the number of enemies, the number of City Centers required to claim victory and the landing site. The colony starts with a small population, which grows in size every turn. By constructing various kinds of buildings, collecting/producing resources and researching technologies, the colony can be greatly expanded. Each can field as big an army as it can support.<br/><br/>Military units are divided into sea, land, air and missile, each type produced by a different line of buildings. Specialists, such as spies, are trained in City Centers. Units can only be given combat orders in advance - the player is presented with a video recording of a battle after one has occurred.<br/><br/>There are two modes: the &quot;world view&quot;, where the colony leader can move armies, trade resources with or attack other colonies, and the &quot;settlement view&quot;, where colony management (such as town planning and building) takes place.<br/><br/>The map is divided into &quot;provinces&quot;, which can differ in land type and the amount of natural resources (food, wood, iron, energy, and, later in the game - Endurium) available. Natural resources are unlimited, but different resources are gathered at different rates on different land types.<br/><br/>Capturing all of the other colonies&rsquo; territories or constructing a pre-set number of City Centers wins the game.

Numerous user-created websites have popped up to facilitate this feature.<br/>The new &quot;Coke Zero Mascot Mash Up&quot; mode, where teams are made up entirely of the school's mascot.

The main characters combat the Empire under the organization called The Third Eye, (abbreviated &quot;3YE&quot;) under the names Red (female in the North American version, ambiguous in the Japanese) and Blue in recognition and tribute to the characters from the original game, and along with Yellow on the team, they are known as Gunstar Super Heroes. The Gunstars must travel to the moons, stop the resurrected Empire, and recapture the Treasure Gems, four mystical stones with an unknown power that had driven the story in the last game. The game has different storylines based on what difficulty is chosen and which character the player is playing as.<br/><br/>The gameplay makes a number of changes from the original Gunstar Heroes. The controls for Red and Blue no longer distinguish by the Free and Fixed Shot and both have more advanced, equal and versatile controls.

There she is met by Edward Plunkett, an adventurer, and Father James O'Flaherty, a bishop.<br/><br/>The plot is that a long time ago, an old man was a captain of a ship named 'The Mary Alice' that went down in a terrible accident involving fire. The old man was blamed and received bad treatment before he went into a sad retirement (it is hinted that the fire was actually caused by the cook on the ship). He and his wife, still wealthy from the ship's earnings, purchased an old monastery in Aberystwyth. The old man and his wife (named Ogden and Bessy) became friends with a certain woman named Ellaine. She believed that the boat accident wasn't Ogden's fault. Welcoming of her sympathy and understanding Ellaine and Ogden became very close. Ellaine was married to an alchemist named Patrick. Ellaine had picked Patrick over James (the 3rd character the player finds) as a husband. Patrick had promised James that he would protect Ellaine, but one day, something bad happened. Ellaine was killed by burglars that broke into her house. In their devastation at her death, Ogden and Patrick looked for mystical ways of bringing her back. After much research, Patrick found an ancient text that could bring the dead back to life.<br/><br/>The spell required that several fresh bodies were fed to a cauldron over time. Ogden and Patrick began with prostitutes and thieves but then began to go to nearby towns and abduct innocent people, murdering them horribly at the monastery.<br/><br/>After donating over two hundred bodies to the cauldron, the spell took effect. But, unfortunately, it didn't go as planned. Ellaine's body was resurrected, but not her soul. She was a monster, a beast with the image of an angel. On top of that, all the innocent people who had been sacrificed were awake as well. They came in many forms: ghosts, spirits, monsters, zombies, beasts, etc. What happens in the time between here and the start of the game is unknown. Koudelka is summoned there by the spirit of Ellaine. Edward is there because he heard rumours and came to investigate and James (who is unaware of Ellaine's death at the beginning) was sent there by his coven.<br/><br/>Koudelka is the precursor to Sacnoth's Shadow Hearts series.

Waiting out the surface radiation, centuries passed before the humans finally ventured back into the world above, discovering that, in their absence, their planet had sprouted a lush, overgrown jungle.<br/><br/>In the humans' place, the planet had also managed to sprout a race of peaceful mutants known as the Bouzouk (spelled &quot;Boozook&quot; in the US release), who, were it not for their tails, pointed ears, and extraordinarily long noses would be virtually indistinguishable from man. In the societal structure of the Bouzouk there was a King and a Council of Wisemen, seven mystics who had successfully maintained harmony by guarding the Chprotznog, a sacred containment unit used to channel and subsequently trap evil spirits.<br/><br/>Having failed to learn their lesson from last time, the humans immediately waged war on the tranquil Bouzouk tribe in what became known as &quot;The Great Battle&quot;. In a mere day, the humans destroyed their civilization, massacring many innocent Bouzouks and looting their holy artifacts, including the Chprotznog. The surviving Bouzouks were enslaved and forced to construct a new society for the humans, the great vertical city of Vlurxtrznbnaxl. An economically self-sufficient city run on wind power and surrounded by farmland, the citizens live in different parts of the city according to their socio-economic status: the poor live on the lower levels, the rich and powerful live on the higher levels. The remaining Bouzouk peoples became exploited and oppressed; their once great society in shambles, they're left to work menial jobs and manual labor and live uneasily alongside the humans, while their deposed King now spends his days drinking beer and watching TV.<br/><br/>The game begins about a century later, where the great city has since devolved into a nightmarish dystopia, ruled by a bureaucratic and totalitarian government. Heading the government is The President, accompanied by his corrupt and maniacal advisor the BigWig, who enacts excessive taxation (including taxes on breathing and walking) and fear-based propaganda upon the city citizens, including a peculiar warning about a nocturnal beast who feeds upon those who oppose their government's regulations. In the lower levels of the city, relations between humans and Bouzouks have grown to their most tense, giving rise to a group known as the Bouzouk Freedom Party, a terrorist organization who, being natural pacifists, have yet to commit any actual acts of terrorism.<br/><br/>Professor Azimuth, an eminent political and scientific human personality known for his work on manipulating the aging process of cells, sympathizes with the plight of the Bouzouks and becomes determined to help end their oppression. In his research, he discovers the legend of the Schnibble, a mystical entity that is believed to have the ability to cause peace and prosperity to flourish, and begins work on finding a way to unleash it. Word spreads about his work, and Azimuth is hailed as a hero by the Bouzouk community. Unfortunately, word of the Schnibble also reaches the ears of the BigWig. To stave off any chance of a revolution, the BigWig and his thugs storm the home of Azimuth and his young, adopted half-human, half-Bouzouk son, Woodruff.<br/><br/>Professor Azimuth barely has time to hide Woodruff before the BigWig breaks into their house, kidnapping the professor and ruthlessly gunning down Woodruff's beloved teddy bear in the process, but not before befitting him with a Viblefrotzer, an invention of his own design that can speed up the aging process (and looks eerily similar to a Sony Walkman). Within seconds, Woodruff ages about fifteen years, finding himself now prepared for an epic quest: rescue his adopted father, avenge the death of his teddy bear by extracting revenge on the evil BigWig and find a way to unleash the Schnibble and bring peace back to the city.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The Bizarre Adventures of Woodruff and the Schnibble&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "90717": {"poll": [], "name": "Voyage: Inspired by Jules Verne", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US Windows edition"], "average": "7.33333", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "3", "videogamedeveloper": ["Kheops Studio"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["The Adventure Company"], "description": "Voyage: Inspired by Jules Verne (known as Journey to the Moon in the United Kingdom) is a point-and-click adventure game with pre-rendered graphics, developed by Kheops Studio and published by The Adventure Company for the PC in 2005. The game's story focuses on a French adventurer's journey to the moon in the 19th century, and the ancient lunar civilization he finds there.<br/><br/>Voyage is loosely based on the novels From the Earth to the Moon and Around the Moon by science-fiction author Jules Verne, and the novel The First Men in the Moon by science-fiction author H.G. Wells.<br/><br/>The &quot;Intelligence Management System&quot; featured in Voyage is a score assigned to the player by the inhabitants of the moon. For each puzzle the player solves, and for certain actions, the score is increased and the inhabitants of the moon treat the player with more respect.<br/><br/>Voyage is set in the year 1851. President Barbicane of the 'Gun Club' decides to build an enormous cannon in Baltimore to shoot a shell, capable of supporting human life, towards the moon in the hopes of a successful landing. Voyage's protagonist, Michel Ardan, volunteers to travel in the aluminium shell. After the game's brief introduction in the shell, Ardan lands on the moon and discovers the intelligent creatures and lush plant life living there. The main accessible areas in the game are the moon's surface, and the underground Selenite civilization.<br/><br/>Voyage begins as Ardan awakes in the shell and discovers his two dead companions: Barbicane and Nicholl. He finds a note written by Barbicane, explaining that he and Nicholl had sacrificed themselves for Ardan, as there was insufficient oxygen to support three men. Ardan also finds a note that Barbicane had concealed in his hat from Diana, and a love letter from Diana to Nicholl. Once Ardan successfully lands on the moon, he must solve a series of puzzles on the surface in order to gain access the hidden civilization below. There he encounters the Selenite civilization. Then Ardan focusses on finding a way to leave the moon and report his findings to Earth.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Voyage: Inspired by Jules Verne&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "90718": {"poll": [], "name": "Return to Mysterious Island", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iPhone edition", "US Windows edition"], "average": "7.5", "videogameseries": ["Return to Mysterious Island"], "videogametheme": ["Nature / Jungle"], "usersrated": "7", "videogamedeveloper": ["Kheops Studio", "Micro\u00efds"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["iPhone", "Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["The Adventure Company", "Chillingo"], "description": "Return to Mysterious Island follows Mina, a strong young woman alone on a round-the-world sailing expedition.

You journey is to your death, preferably by high-powered plasma torpedo volleys, if the armada of aliens known as 'the nomads' are to be believed. The nomads have no homeworld, they don't believe it's time to 'settle down' as a species. They are still looking to find the right planet, and killing time (and aliens) in the meantime. It's nothing personal you understand, it's just the way the nomads entertain themselves. Galactic genocide is their sport of choice.<br/><br/>The Nomads is the latest expansion pack for Gratuitous Space Battles. The Nomads are the oldest race in the known universe. They are just travelling from A to B, (although nobody now remembers where A was, or what they are heading to B for), and looking for a little 'exploding aliens' sport on their journey. The nomads are travelling through your part of space, and your homeworlds destruction is this weeks entertainment for them.<br/><br/>What The Nomads Expansion Pack Contains:<br/>10 New ships. 4 Cruisers 3 Frigates and 3 fighters, all in a new graphical style by the same artist who did the original GSB artwork. The nomad ships are influenced by retro cars, planes and the art-deco feel of 'the retro future', with a strong 1960s rocketship vibe. They also contain a number of cannibalized (or stolen) ship parts taken from the remnants of other GSB races they have beaten in battle. The Nomads are the first GSB race to have no single unifying color.<br/><br/>5 New ship modules:  The nomads have an eclectic mix of additional ship modules. Nomadic dogfighter lasers are fast-tracking (but low damage) lasers for fighters, designed for anti-fighter combat. They also have armored powerplants and faster engines for frigates, and cruisers get volley-firing laser beams and long range fast missile launchers.<br/><br/>New ship bonuses. The nomad ships are slightly larger than normal, and they have speed bonuses. These ships have been travelling across the galaxies for millenia, and those guys know how to build engines.<br/> What The Pack does NOT contain:<br/>Completely new gameplay modes, and major features that change how the game plays, any new AI orders... basically anything that is not listed in the list above.

Each card holder is then placed window-side up on the game board, in the matching-color rectangle. Each player selects a token, places it on the 'Start' space on the game board, and rolls the dice to determine who plays first (highest roller, play continues clockwise).<br/><br/>Ona player's turn, that player rolls the dice and moves his token that number of spaces in any direction (backtracking in the same turn is not allowed). If the player lands on a colored, lettered space, the player must open the corresponding window (by letter) on the corresponding card holder (by color).

If there is a dispute, the Master List is consulted by revealing the identification number at the bottom of the card. The player making the identification consults the list in secret. If he is correct, the card is removed from the holder and rewarded to the player, who closes the windows and places another card in the holder. That player rolls the dice and moves again.<br/><br/>If the player is incorrect, he places the card holder back on the board (leaving the windows open or closed, as they were).

Three follow-ups to this game have been released. More than 25 million copies of Bejeweled have been sold, and the game has been downloaded more than 150 million times.<br/><br/>The game was initially created by PopCap Games as a web-based Flash game called Diamond Mine. It was reportedly successful for PopCap - a company formed in 2000. PopCap created partnerships with established Internet gaming sites such as Microsoft Zone to host Bejeweled as well. The name Bejeweled was suggested by Microsoft, who thought that the original name Diamond Mine was too similar to that of an existing game, Diamond Mines.<br/><br/>The game has also been ported to other platforms, including Microsoft Windows, where it was called Bejeweled Deluxe. Astraware produced versions for PDAs on the Palm OS, Windows Mobile, Smartphone and Palm platforms. They also released Bejeweled Deluxe on the Xbox as a downloadable Xbox Live Arcade game. On September 12, 2006, it was released as one of the first games downloadable from the iTunes Store for the Apple iPod.<br/>The objective of this game is to swap one gem with an adjacent gem to form a horizontal or vertical chain of three or more gems. Bonus points are given when more than three identical gems are formed or forms two lines of identical gems in one swap. Gems disappear when chains are formed and gems fall from the top to fill in gaps. Sometimes chain reactions, called cascades, are triggered, where chains are formed by the falling gems. Cascades are awarded with bonus points. There are two variations of the game to choose from.<br/><br/>Although normally the player gets only 3 in a row for gems, sometimes they can get 4 or 5 in a row. And in rare conditions, they can get 6, 7 and even 8 in a row. However, some versions of the engine do not register it. The player gets more points and sometimes special powerups from more than 3 gems in a row<br/> Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Bejeweled,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "90820": {"poll": [], "name": "Empire of the Ants", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US Windows edition"], "average": "1", "videogametheme": ["Animals"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Micro\u00efds"], "videogamegenre": ["Life Simulation", "Real Time Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Micro\u00efds"], "description": "Empire of the Ants is a video game released in 2000, developed by Micro&iuml;ds, and based on a novel of the same name written by Bernard Werber.<br/><br/>The real time 3D game is playable on a network with up to 8 players, and the game contains more than 60 species of insects and different animals.

It was a world filled with beauty and great things, where disease was almost unknown and sadness completely extinct.<br/><br/>But something happened. No one really knows what &ndash; not anymore, anyway. They call it the &ldquo;Fall&rdquo;, because that&rsquo;s what it was. Somehow, somewhere, the Gods forgot themselves and fell. Maybe they soared so high that, like a towering spire, they grew too lofty and collapsed under their own might. Perhaps they took for granted all that beauty and became jaded to perfection, and sought only to undo what they had done. Who knows? But it happened. In one fell swoop, all the nations of the world, all it&rsquo;s people, became upset with one another and without so much as thinking brought a terrible end to what had once been.<br/><br/>And so it came to pass. Their weapons were great, their destruction complete. They unleashed on the world a plague of fiery bombs, mighty missiles, and armies of robots. Diseases, their effects forgotten for generations, were brought out from hiding and released on the masses. Men, women, and children died by the millions. Chemicals, poisonous not only to man but the very earth and air, came to taint even the fabric of the planet. And then, the great clouds of red fire came to burn away what was left, erasing every last vestige of the Ancients&rsquo; presence on the world. Entire cities were blasted into oblivion; nation-states smudged like smoky vapor in the burning wind, or buried under the dust that had once been the bodies of so many billions of humankind.<br/><br/>But life did not die there. Somehow...people survived. Like rats hiding under a smoldering furnace, life escaped ultimate destruction. No one can know who they were, or what horrors they faced in their time &ndash; it was far too long ago for anyone to truly know. But they lived, they persisted, and they gave birth to the men of what is now known as the Twisted Earth, the unraveling ruined world that is DARWIN&rsquo;S WORLD.<br/><br/>This book, Denizens Of The Twisted Earth, puts forward information on these survivors, and the pseudo-societies they have come to resurrect. Denizens Of The Twisted Earth is an important addition to the basic rules that embellishes upon the basic framework of the Twisted Earth and it&rsquo;s rumored inhabitants. It is also a major sourcebook for the wind-swept and desolate setting of DARWIN&rsquo;S WORLD, a lost planet of dead dreams and dwindling life.<br/><br/>Within these pages you will find a much more in-depth look at the deserts, ruined cities, and wilderness of the world; as well as the numerous struggling communities, factions, and postapocalyptic cultures that vie violently for it&rsquo;s control.<br/><br/>Also within these pages are a number of prestige classes meant to spark interest and creativity in the minds of players and referees alike.<br/><br/>"}, "90870": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1627614.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Tumult", "Uluru: Neuer Tumult am Ayers Rock"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Lauge Luchau"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Harald Lieske"], "boardgamepublisher": ["KOSMOS", "Competo / Marektoy", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.", "SimplyFun"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1627614_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Puzzle", "Real-time"], "boardgamehonor": ["2011 \u00c5rets Spill Best Family Game Nominee", "2011 Deutscher Lernspielpreis \"9 years and up\" Nominee", "2011 Kinderspielexperten \"8-to-13-year-olds\" Nominee", "2011 Spiel des Jahres Recommended", "2012 Golden Geek Best Abstract Board Game Nominee", "2012 Guldbrikken Best Adult Game Nominee", "2013/Spring Parents' Choice Gold Award Winner"], "description": "We're in Australia, a land of myth and magic, and every night at sundown eight dreambirds gather around the holy rock Uluru.

People cards are valued from 1 to 10 based on the amount of shame that person would have towards you should you be revealed as the culprit. Grannies are merciless...<br/><br/>Each player receives a hand of five odor cards, ranging in value from 0 to 7, with one 7, two 6s and so on to eight 0s. Going once around the table, each player in turn asks his neighbor, &quot;So how about it? Are you the one contributing to climate change? Are you the one making more methane?&quot; And so on. That neighbor can either fess up &ndash; in which case he scores all the people cards in play &ndash; or he can deny the charge, in which case the active player randomly draws a card from his hand and lays it on the table in front of the neighbor, revealing some of the smell that others have detected.<br/><br/>If you make it once around the table without anyone confessing, add another person card to the crowd of sniffers, then go around the table again. Repeat this process up to three times, at which point most people will have three cards in front of them. Everyone then simultaneously points to the person who they think created the ruckus (that is, who has the largest total of odor cards), abstaining if they are that person. Everyone then sums their stink, with the &quot;winner&quot; claiming the person cards in play and a card for each person blaming him; anyone who accuses a player incorrectly is penalized. Smallest score after a number of rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>Being dealt a hand of high numbers doesn't automatically presage your coronation as a gas god as high numbers typically have a special power that comes into play when someone reveals the card from your hand. The 7, for example, removes all other cards in your hand from play, while the 6 lets you exchange up to three cards from your hand with an opponent.

It was the official continuation of the storyline of the Matrix series of films. The game began closed beta-testing in June 2004 which was then opened for people who pre-ordered the game in November 2004. Warner Bros. and Sega officially released MxO on March 22, 2005 in the United States. It was released in Europe on April 15, 2005. The game ran continuously from then until it was ultimately shut down on July 31, 2009 by Sony Online Entertainment.<br/><br/>The player assumes the role of a redpill, a human who was formerly trapped inside the Matrix. When creating a new character, the player is given the choice of taking a blue pill that will return them to their former life (quit the game) or a red pill, which will free their minds from the Matrix. Characters who are unaware of the fact that they are in the simulation are often referred to as &quot;bluepills&quot; because they have either taken the blue pill or have not been given the choice yet. People who are aware of the simulation (players) are referred to as &quot;redpills&quot; because they have taken the red pill (or, in very rare cases, when a character has self-substantiated out of the Matrix on their own). Following the choice between the two pills, the player is then taken through a basic tutorial of the game's mechanics, including mission interaction and the combat system. After the tutorial, they are then free to roam the Mega City (the large metropolis that the entire Matrix story is set in).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The Matrix Online,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "90930": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Antoine Bauza", "Bruno Cathala"], "average": "5.58", "poll": [], "name": "Witty Pong", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Recognition"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "25", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic899124_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Alex A."], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Witty Editions"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic899124.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Sports"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Witty Pong is the first release from French publisher MyWittyGames, which invites gamers to fund projects that they want to see released.<br/><br/>As far back as 2005, designer Antoine Bauza was trying to encapsulate the essence of ping-pong in a board or card game, but his design efforts never came to fruition, so the project was shelved &ndash; until mid-2010 when he chanced to show the prototype to Bruno Cathala.

Players take on the roles of<br/>powerful gods and goddesses in other universes ranging from mythological Greece to the fantasy world of the Mystic Domain.<br/><br/>If you're reading this, you probably know what a roleplaying game is. While most roleplaying games are played around a table, with a arranging a plot or scenario for his players to wind their way through, Divus Ex is a little different.<br/><br/>First off, Divus Ex is best played as a &quot;Semi-Live Roleplaying Game,&quot; or even as a full live-action roleplaying game. Each player becomes an actor, roleplaying a deity or archon, and like an actor, all of the personality quirks of the god should be performed. Breaks are occasionaly taken for the Fate-Decider, the person who runs the game, to announce events and handle any rules questions that may come up. Unlike other RPGs, the Fate-Decider's primary job is not to set a scene and invisibly guide the players through the adventure, but to be a player himself. As Fate, his role is literal; he is very powerful and omnipotent, but the players are ultimately out of his control. He is definitely not omniscient.<br/><br/>The Fate-Decider has little control over time in Divus Ex. The game moves forward at a steady rate. Usually one year of game time equals one hour of gameplay.<br/><br/>Divus Ex is not a game about slaying monsters, recovering treasure, and saving the day. Gods have no need for any of that. Instead, Divus Ex is a game about politics. Influence and strength is what gods desire, and the only way to get it is at the expense of other gods. The most successful gods are the ones who know when to use diplomacy, when to rely on intrigue, and when to throw that all aside and flex some divine power.<br/><br/>Finally, unlike many RPGs, Divus Ex isn't necessarily cooperative. Each player has his own goals, and must be selfish in accomplishing them. This doesn't mean alliances, or even long-lasting friendships, can't be formed. All gods, however, should always keep their own best interests at heart.<br/><br/>"}, "90946": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Dernier Sang", "rpgdesigner": ["Philippe Tromeur"], "rpggenre": ["Horror (Supernatural)", "Modern", "Science Fiction (Post Apocalypse)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2387193.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgproducer": ["Philippe Tromeur"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Dernier Sang"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "average": "0", "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpgseries": ["53 Jeux de R\u00f4les"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2387193_t.png", "description": "From the Game's Introduction:<br/><br/>Fin du monde<br/><br/>Les personnages joueurs sont peut-&ecirc;tre les derniers humains vivant sur la Terre...<br/><br/>Tous les autres hommes sont devenus des monstres assoiff&eacute;s de sang et agit&eacute;s d'une fureur &eacute;ternelle.<br/><br/>Exemple de prologue<br/><br/>Lorsque l'aventure d&eacute;marre, les personnages reviennent d'une croisi&egrave;re en bateau qui a dur&eacute; trois semaines, pendant lesquelles ils n'ont pas tellement &eacute;cout&eacute; la radio...<br/><br/>Les vampires<br/><br/>Les vampires sont cr&eacute;&eacute;s comme des personnages normaux, sans score de mental car leur intelligence est celle d'un insecte carnivore.<br/><br/>Ils n'ont pas de faiblesses ou de pouvoirs particuliers.

Endell. Dr. Endell was a colleague of the eminent dream researcher Dr. William Black, developer of the controversial Dreamwalking drug, Black25. In 1977, Dr. Endell was granted authority to manufacture Black25 in small doses and resume the Dreamwalking experiments detailed in the late Dr. Black&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Black Files&rdquo;. Many of Dr. Black&rsquo;s former students and original staff were happy to return to their old work. In addition, people from all over the country who had reported experiences similar to Dreamwalking were assembled, screened and recruited. Some who came later were experienced Mystics, able to instruct Dr. Endell&rsquo;s Dreamwalkers in the ways of the Empyrean, the dangers of the Taenia and how to manipulate mana.<br/><br/>Morale was high during The Clinic&rsquo;s initial stages as Dr. Endell&rsquo;s experiments closely followed Dr. Black&rsquo;s line of research. However, as time and the capabilities of Clinic analysts progressed, the research began to take a more aggressive turn.<br/><br/>New procedures were planned and enacted. Taeniid larvae, drones and Queens were now captured and examined within the confines of the Dreamworld before being destroyed. Unsuccessful attempts were then made to transport and control the Taenia with the intent of distributing them into the Dreamworlds of others. Clinic research also turned toward influencing the subconscious mind of the Dreamer. The idea was to see if thoughts could be imprinted on the subconscious mind in such a manner as to make the sleeping person do things after he awoke.<br/><br/>These experiments did not go over well with many of the original Analysts and former members of Dr. Black&rsquo;s staff. Their complaints were ignored and many contemplated early retirement. One group of scientists, researchers and Dreamwalkers, led by Dr. Kevin Laerty actually defected from the Clinic and helped to form the organization that would later come to be known as Project Dreamwalker.<br/><br/>The Clinic continued to perform its experiments with mixed results. There were several minor setbacks and one major one: the encounter with the Broodking (see The Broodking Disaster, pg. 30). Despite these obstacles, Clinic research has continued to break new grounds in the study of dreams and how they relate to the waking world. Chief among these is information gathering via dreams and the subconscious mind which has enabled Dr. Endell to turn the Clinic into a valuable asset to his government and corporate benefactors.<br/><br/>With the overall instability of today&rsquo;s world, the unpredictability of certain global leaders and the rise of terrorism, the focus of Clinic research has gradually shifted towards the more police and military oriented applications of Dreamwalking. After the events of 9/11, the Clinic has been granted more funding to pursue its research, some of which has been diverted from Project Dreamwalker<br/><br/>"}, "90971": {"rpgdesigner": ["Brett M.
