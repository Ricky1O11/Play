The player with the highest score wins. A player's score is the number of board points that are part of living domains of their color in the final position, plus a komi in the case of White.<br/><br/><br/>Komi<br/><br/>The komi is the even number of points which are added to White's score at the end of the game as a compensation for playing second.

The citizens of the city &ndash; long tired of being crushed under the oppressive boot of the aristocracy &ndash; rebelled against their oppressors and imprisoned them. The newly-formed government tried their former oppressors for their crimes, and executed many of the most sadistic and evil of them.<br/><br/>One of those executed was Galen Kragovic, the leader of the corrupt city guard. He was accused of many heinous crimes &ndash; primarily the frequent torture sessions that he perpetrated. Kragovic was a skilled torturer, and many fell victim to his foul amusements. Still, justice prevailed, and he was beheaded two weeks after the rebellion began.<br/><br/>Sadly, such evil seldom rests easy. Kragovic awoke in his grave a few nights after his death, whole. At first he was panicked, but then he realized that he had been granted the terrific strength of the dead, and freed himself from his makeshift grave. He spent the next several weeks taking revenge on those responsible for his death &ndash; wiping out the new rulers of the city of Areinsle. He then wandered off, searching for some way to return to the life that he once led.<br/><br/>However, that search soon proved fruitless. He was a freak of nature, forever separated from the living. It was just about the time that he decided to seek a return to life that he first met agents of the clergy of Vecna. He found them devoted to many of the same precepts as him, and they promised to return him to life if he served them for a period of 100 years. Greedy for a chance at life, he agreed. He was set up in abandoned tower, upon the agreement that he would serve as one of the most skilled of the clergy&rsquo;s torturers.<br/><br/>Recently, an ally of the PCs has been captured and sent to this torturer. Through whatever means you deem appropriate, they learn of the location of this lost tower. At the moment, the tower is also occupied by several servants of the cult of Vecna, who await results from Kragovic&rsquo;s work. Kragovic has almost certainly spotted the approaching PCs through his network of zombie birds (DC 30 Spot check to notice the strange wobble in the flight of the bird flying high above the PCs; the birds seeing the PCs is automatic unless they are taking particular precautions to avoid such surveillance; the bird has a Spot of +2 otherwise). While he is probably aware of their approach, he has neglected to inform Corrin (the leader of the cultists of Vecna currently at the tower) &ndash; there is little love lost between the two of them, and Kragovic is hoping that the PCs will eliminate the bothersome man for him.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>For 5th - 7th level characters<br/><br/>"}, "201534": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Soulscape Paintings", "rpgdesigner": ["Doyce Testerman"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3046985.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgproducer": ["Eric R.

Built at the order of a wealthy trader, it was obviously once an opulent home, but is now little more than a nesting place of several nocturnal creatures and a prison for the tortured ghosts of the family that once lived here.<br/><br/>The story of the mansion is simple, and one heard all too frequently in these dangerous times. A merchant by the name of Firenze, successful in business (running a trading company on the outskirts of the Kingdom) and happy in his family life, decided that the time had come to build a proper home for his wife and children: a place befitting his success, a place to truly be at home and comfortable, a place to grow old in...<br/><br/>Such was not to be the case.<br/><br/>Firenze built his home; not far from town, but far enough that he and his family could be sure they would never be bothered by troublesome neighbors in the foreseeable future. A nearby pond provided water and a relaxing atmosphere, servants were hired, a garden was planted (something Firenze had dreamed of while he and his wife had lived in their cramped town house), and Firenze looked at it all and smiled.<br/><br/>Two years passed before the raiders came.<br/><br/>Pushed out of the northern mountains in search of prey following two harsh winters and dry summers, several orc tribes had been encountered around nearby villages, but Firenze was hardly worried: if raiders came within striking distance of his home, they would first have to circumvent the town of Cairun to the north, giving him ample time to evacuate his family and seek refuge within the town's walls; they still owned that small townhouse, after all.<br/><br/>But the raiders came out of the woods to the south. Firenze and his family died quickly, and none escaped. The house itself escaped most of the damage, since outriders from Cairun discovered and drove off the orcs before they could finish the job they had started. The story should have ended there, but it did not. Soon stories began to circulate the Cairun taverns of lights and sounds coming from the Firenze mansion: strange lights and horrible sounds -- the sounds of a family being put to death, again and again. The Firenze family had risen as restless spirits -- which was odd, given that while the family had died violently, they had not died suffering; but Cairun is a busy town, and Firenze had never been a man to favor the local temples with much patronage, so none felt morally compelled to investigate the mystery, and those who felt the stronger pull of merchant's gold and decided to visit the mansion... suffice it to say that no local will go near the place.<br/><br/>The secret to the mystery is that the Firenze deaths did not cause the family the sort of grief and trauma that commonly results in restless spirits; the cause of the strange haunting is a powerful evil artifact that the merchant had hanging on a wall for the last two years of his life -- dormant, in fact dormant and nearly undetectable for thirty years, until it was awakened by the death and destruction created by the orc raiders.

He announced his retirement at the 23rd Festival of Fire (commemorating his defeat of a pair of green dragons which were ravaging the countryside) and further announced he would select an apprentice at the 25th Festival of Fire. He promised that his apprentice would return in to choose another apprentice at the Festival of Fire five years subsequent. This process was to continue &ndash; every five years, his apprentice would announce the new apprentice at the Festival of Fire &ndash; and in the event of his death, instead of announcing the new apprentice, his old apprentice would announce his death. He did this for several reasons - he wished for his legacy to remain alive in the world through his apprentices, he wished to have &quot;new blood&quot; every so often to offer a fresh view on his research, and he knew he would need apprentices to perform various household duties. He used mighty magics to raise a keep on the rim of a volcano, knowing full well that the location in and of itself would help discourage frivolous seekers of information (it also provided a wonderful setting to study fire magic). He spent a year searching for someone suitable to be his first apprentice, and settled on an attractive 19-year old woman (he of course wanted some companionship &ndash; which would include the role of consort &ndash; in his retirement). She announced the apprenticeship of another beautiful woman &ndash; this one twenty years old &ndash; five years later. After two more female apprentices, his apprentice was announced as a male (the old sage had found a consort from one of the outer planes by this time) and the apprentices were roughly evenly split between male and female from that time.<br/><br/>The local rulers (as well as certain other powerful individuals and organizations) have on occasion sent groups to ask the sage questions and glean advice over the intervening seventy years. In the first year, they sent three expeditions. Two turned back from the volcano, but the third returned with a map to the keep. The requests for aid became more infrequent over the years, as the rulers more or less forgot about the resources the sage had (which suited him just fine) and the last request for aid was sent eight years ago by his third apprentice (who still resided in the town).

Influence is measured in terms of INFLUENCE points. Different hands of cards acquired during the game will score different INFLUENCE points and the player with the highest number of INFLUENCE points wins at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Players start the game by each drawing a card from the top of a common shuffled DECK. The player with the highest number starts first and the players get their turns in a clockwise manner. The drawn cards go back to the bottom of the DECK. In the case of ties, the tied players draw again till the turns are resolved.<br/><br/>At the beginning of a cycle of turns (from player back to the same player), the top card from the DECK is drawn and placed face up. Players can then take turns to bid and acquire this card using Oinks of the same element. The lowest bid is 1 Oink and players who pass will not be eligible to bid again in the same cycle of turns. Players may not bid for more than what they actually have in Oinks but the number of Oinks each player has can be hidden from other players during play. Each subsequent active bidder must offer a higher value than the previous one. The highest bidder gets the card and the next card is drawn from the DECK.<br/><br/>While the rest of the unsuccessful bidders get back their bids, the amount of Oinks from the successful bidder is divided equally among the rest of the players. This is so UNLESS one of the players is holding on to a card whose FACE VALUE corresponds with the value of the bid or the unit value of the bid E.g. In a bid of 28, 8 is the unit value. If more than one player has cards with the corresponding FACE VALUE, they share the bid amount equally. If any player has more cards of the same corresponding FACE VALUE than others in this situation, he/she will get the entire amount from the bid. After dividing among the players, any remaining amount will be pooled to be accumulated for the next bid. If any division of the bid amount cannot be resolved, it will remain in the pool.<br/><br/>Each time a player bids an amount with a unit value of 0 (E.g. 10, 20, 30), another card will be drawn in addition to the first one in the next bid as a set. Cards in a set cannot be bid separately. Players can bid using a mix of Oinks belonging to any element corresponding with the cards within the set. All acquired cards are placed in front of the players in clear view for others and a player may not bid an amount which has a unit value that corresponds to one of the FACE VALUE belonging to one of his/her cards. The game ends when there are no more cards to bid.<br/><br/>INFLUENCE points are calculated in terms of sets. For each single card, 1 point, each set of 2 cards of the same FACE value, 4 points, each set of 3 cards of the same FACE value, 9 points and a full set of 4 cards of the same FACE value, 16 points. A set of 5 cards of sequential numbers belonging to the same element will receive 25 points, for 6 cards, 36 points, 7 cards, 49 points, 8 cards, 64 points and 9 cards, 81 points.

There are also at about 30 smaller planet tokens which represent the details from the bigger ones and black holes (25 + 5). Players create a square galaxy by putting the large tokens face up on the table in three variants: 3x3, 4x4 and 5x5. The smaller tokens are then shuffled and put in the same manner next to the galaxy (the number of items and their choice depends on the choice of the large tokens). Players may add a few black holes to provide a bit of player - player and player - game interaction. Players put their rockets (pawns) and a few counters of their colour on the edge planets (large, face up) which become their homes and the game is ready to begin.<br/><br/>To move the rocket a player has to flip the small tokens in order to find a planet which is adjacent to the one he/she is currently standing on. When this happens the player moves the space ship onto that planet and may take another turn. When a mistake is made another player starts his/her turn. Each small token has to be flipped back so that it stays face down all the time (like in a memo game). The goal is to visit all the edge planets and gather all kinds of counters available on them.

The cards are distributed equally among the players along with an equal number of tokens. Players take turns asking the player to their left the question on one of their cards, the answer to which is always some kind of plant or flower. The Keeper of the Pool judges the answer against the book and if the answer is wrong, the responder pays the asker one of his tokens.<br/><br/>Some examples from the book: <br/>Plant a shepherd. What will come up? Phlox.<br/>Plant a river. What will come up? A Currant.<br/>Plant a man who won't pay his debts. What will come up? Willow.<br/><br/>There is one exceptional rule. &quot;7. By vote of a majority of the players, rewards shall be paid from the pool for unusual brilliancy, and fines imposed for ludicrously erroneous answers. For example, when this game was first played, a young lady drawled out, in answer to the question 'Plant a menagerie. What will come up?' the single word 'Grapes'. Upon being made to realize that she intended to suggest the idea of 'Gray apes', the Keeper of the Pool voluntarily paid to her the sum of ten counters.&quot; Yes, that entire passage is in the rule booklet.<br/><br/>"}, "201637": {"boardgamedesigner": ["\u30b7\u30ad\u30ea\u30c8 (Shikirito)"], "average": "5.6", "statistics": [], "name": "Hourglass of Life", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "5", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3048285_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["\u30b7\u30ad\u30ea\u30c8 (Shikirito)"], "boardgamepublisher": ["River Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3048285.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Japanese first edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "poll": [], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "There is a girl in a hospital with only seven days to live.

Players use hand-picked teams of extraordinary creatures to battle until one player has no one left.<br/><br/>Learn the game in 3 minutes, play a match in 5-15 minutes.<br/><br/>Players begin a standard match with a team of creature cards and 4 button cards representing A, B, X, and Y actions.  A single creature card is the active combatant for each player while all others sit on the side awaiting use.<br/><br/>All creatures in the game possess types, a weight, a passive ability, and a special action tied to one of the four button cards.<br/><br/>Each round, players secretly and simultaneously select a first and second action card.  Players reveal and resolve their first action and then reveal and resolve their second.  When directly contested actions occur, the lighter weight creature acts first.<br/><br/>By default, the A action deals damage, the B action prevents damage and then deals damage back to the attacker, the X action switches out a player's active combatant for a different one, and the Y action prevents future blocking or takes control of an opponent's attempt to switch.  A creature's special action entirely replaces the default effect of one action button.<br/><br/>Types have no innate effect on gameplay (so players don't need to remember special rules based on types) but are sometimes referenced in passive abilities or special actions.<br/><br/>The most important effect in the game is damage.  Rather than dealing with health totals, chits, dials, or dice, a creature is either damaged or it isn't.  When a creature becomes damaged, it is flipped over to its damaged side.

Wolf-headed men leap off the dragon ship and begin shooting with MP-40's. The young fisherman starts the motor of his small boat and turns it around. He decides to head for the base at Scapa Flow.

After the warmup and a prologue scene there are four main scenes and three interludes, and then an epilogue. In the main scenes the players tell about the war and their characters in it, and later about the menacing Nazi zombies. Every time a player has had their turn and told a bit, they have to roll a four-sided die. If they roll a one they become &quot;threatened.&quot; If they roll a one while threatened, their character dies. The first main scene ends after one has fallen, the rest after two have kicked the bucket. The intent is to build up tension and at the same time tell a grim tale. If your character dies, you must instead speak for the war and the Nazi zombies. You don't play an individual Nazi zombie. In the interlude, players with surviving characters play more traditional in-character roleplay. This builds up the characters as people that we care about, so there's something to lose when the bullets are flying and the dice are rolling.<br/><br/>"}, "201668": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3051417.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Brian Tinsman", "Alexandra Tinsman"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Lars Nielsen"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3051417_t.png", "minplaytime": "40", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Fantasy", "Mythology"], "description": "Cosmic Balance is a hybrid board/card game of battling gods, angels, and demons for 2-5 players.

This is a type of game where players take on the role of various heroes that go on thrilling adventures.

Instead, it presents a setting that is rooted in one of the darker chapters of Christian history.<br/><br/>However, Lucheat Lux Vestra is also a great tool for examining your morals and beliefs. As heroes in extraordinary circumstances, the Light Bearers are forced to make difficult choices in the name of their faith. This gives the players insight as to how they would feel if they were to be put into similar (though hopefully less high-stakes!) situations in real life, and gives the group something to reflect upon and discuss in the context of Scripture after the session is over.<br/><br/>Unlike board games, Lucheat Lux Vestra does not have a special board or other components. All you need are a copy of this book, some pencils, two decks of playing cards (preferably with different colored backs) and some friends!<br/><br/>Once you&rsquo;ve got this sorted out, one of you takes the role of the Game Master, or GM. This role is special as they act as the referee and the storyteller in the game. The GM is responsible for narrating the situations, acting out the lines of the other characters and adjudicating the rules.

Corporations zealously usurp each other and leave humanity an easy target for the forces of darkness and corruption.<br/><br/>But there is still hope as one group stands up and waves the flag of unity among men. It is the last bastion capable of uniting the forces of mankind in full. These powerful men and women call themselves The Cartel.  <br/><br/>    History: Immerse yourself in the history and origins of The Cartel. Discover the past that sets the foundation for success against an impossible present.<br/>    Structure: Learn how this well-oiled machine that oversees corporations and the solar system is put together. See how this behemoth of juxtaposed voices delivers on the promise of a better future.<br/>    Freelancers: The freelancers walk the edge of the law, but without them the society of Mutant Chronicles would not work. Learn some of the secrets to the success of the Freelancing Independent Corporations&rsquo; Committee within The Cartel.<br/>    Underbelly: Even The Cartel has its seamy underside. Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

In Vampsylvania, you&rsquo;re a newly-risen vampire ready to take the world by the throat. Unfortunately, you&rsquo;ve risen in the most vampire-savvy place on Earth. Hunting here isn&rsquo;t gonna be easy. The villagers are tough, and they&rsquo;re loaded with anti-vamp weapons, skills, and allies. And to make matters worse, your fellow vamps keep trying to sabotage you, too!<br/><br/>Game play is pretty simple. Each round&mdash;which we call a Hunt&mdash;a new Villager is revealed. Players compete to capture the Villager by playing bonuses on themselves to raise their Vamp score, which increases their chances of capturing a Villager. But players can also complicate things for other each other. Spoiler cards can be used to lower a player&rsquo;s Vamp score, or even take a player out completely&hellip;for now, anyway. Some spoilers make Villagers tougher, which makes things harder for everyone, but if you think you alone have the cards to pull it off, it might be just the edge you need.<br/><br/>Once everyone has played their cards, everyone rolls dice and adds the result to their Vamp score; if you get a high enough score, you capture the villager! Capture enough Villagers, and you win the game. Don&rsquo;t get cocky, though. Villagers will often escape the Hunt without being captured, and end up in the Angry Mob pile. If enough Villagers end up in the Angry Mob, all the players lose and the Villagers win! Like we said, winning here isn&rsquo;t gonna be easy.<br/><br/>"}, "201850": {"rpgdesigner": ["N.

How to find out which nephew should be rich? You will each be given a large amount of money and whoever can spend it first will be the rightful heir. Visit the most exclusive theatres or eat in the most expensive restaurants. Buy old properties for the price of new ones and sell them as ruins. Host a huge party in your mansion or on your private boat. Spend like your life would depend on it. Spend to become rich! If you're the first to run through the money on hand, you'll receive the rest of his inheritance &ndash; oh, and win the game.<br/><br/>In Last Will, each player starts with a certain amount of money, an individual player board, two errand boys and two cards in some combination of properties and helpers. At the start of each round, lay out cards from the appropriate decks on the offering boards; the four regular decks are properties, companions, events, helpers and expenses, with special cards forming a deck of their own. The particular mix of cards varies by round and by the number of players.<br/><br/>Each player then chooses a plan for the round, with each plan indicating the number of cards the player draws (drawn immediately from the four regular decks in any combination), how many errand boys he can use later (one or two), the number of actions available to him that round, and his spot in the playing order that round. In the playing order for that round, players then take turns choosing an action with their errand boy(s), with those actions being:<br/><br/>Take a card on display and add it to your hand.<br/>    Draw a card from any regular deck &ndash; This can be chosen only once by each player.<br/>    Visit the opera and spend $2.<br/>    Adjust the value modifiers in the property market.<br/>    Take a player board extension, thereby giving you room to play more cards.<br/><br/>Players then take actions in the playing order for that round, with each player having as many actions as indicated on his plan. Actions let you play one-time events (which have a cost, possibly variable); helpers and recurring expenses (which are placed on your individual player board); and properties (which cost money and may depreciate over time). You can often play companions with events or recurring expenses &ndash; of course you should bring a date to the opera or a horse on your yacht! &ndash; to increase their cost. You can also use actions to activate cards on your player board, possibly with one or more companions and always with the goal of spending money. Helpers and special cards can provide you with unique powers to further boost your profligacy.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, you must discard down to two cards in hand, and properties that can depreciate do so; this is good as a player cannot go bankrupt if he owns properties, and the only way to get rid of properties is to sell them, which regretably puts money back in your hands unless the depreciation was intense or you manipulate the market.<br/><br/>If a player has no money and no properties, he declares bankruptcy and the game ends at the conclusion of that round; otherwise the game ends after seven rounds. The player who has the least money (or even who is most in debt) wins.<br/><br/><br/>In Last Will: Getting Sacked, the lawyers have found a hidden clause in your uncle's last will. Spending money faster than all your relatives will not be enough. To inherit your uncle's fortune, you must also lose your job! After all, your uncle's heritage can't go to someone who's employed!<br/><br/>With this expansion added to Last Will, each player begins the game with a job card that provides him with a regular income each turn and details a number of things the player must do in order to get fired. Unlike in real life, it can be difficult to persuade your employer to give you the old heave-ho. When you miss work, he's inclined to be charitable because he liked your uncle and he's sorry for your loss. To make him angry, you need to get caught living it up when you should be working. He won't sack you straight away, but he will at least dock your salary.<br/><br/>Once per round, you are able to reduce your income by completing one of the things listed on the job card, earning you a demotion. Even your kindly old boss has his limits, though; when you earn enough demotions to cancel out every line of income, you can discard your employment card. Congratulations: You have been sacked and are one step closer to winning the game!<br/><br/>You will also have a chance to find yourself a good, demanding wife. A wedding is such a romantic way to spend piles of money in a hurry, right? The expansion has six nuptial cards, so get down on one knee and ask the question!<br/><br/>Also, with this expansion, each game can have a different planning board to bring additional variety to the game. When you set up the game boards, you randomly select the eight plan tiles that will be used in the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Italian first edition"], "average": "7.5", "name": "Last Will (compilation editions)", "playingtime": "75", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Hand Management", "Worker Placement"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "6", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: England", "Tableau Building"]}, "201858": {"poll": [], "name": "Tequila & Boom Boom", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["DOS edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon", "Furries / Talking Animals", "Western"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Dynabyte"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade", "Point-and-Click"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sacis"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Point and click game with the occasional QTE where you control a bobcat bandit named Tequila, who heads into a place called Stinky Town, and ends up trying to save the town, and the girl, from the clutches of the evil Mr Vyle.<br/><br/>"}, "201859": {"poll": [], "name": "Nerves of Steel", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["DOS 3.5\" Disk edition", "DOS CD-ROM edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["War - Modern"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["BnB Software", "Rainmaker Software"], "videogamegenre": ["First Person Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Merit Software"], "description": "&quot;Nerves of Steel is a First-person shooter video game Developed by Rainmaker Software and BnB Software that was published by Merit Studios in 1995 for DOS Computers.<br/><br/>Nerves of Steel is set in the near future in Southeast Asia where ruler Kim Dung Moon is set on purifying the world.

The MS-DOS version was built on the Build engine, licensed from 3D Realms. The version used is a slightly earlier version of the engine. The light sourcing from the SlaveDriver engine is not used; the Build engine's own light sourcing is used instead.<br/><br/>The HUD interface is different; featuring an ammo counter, lungs (oxygen levels) for swimming and animated mana and blood vessels. Players have usable Mana energy that can cast spells once the spell has been acquired (e.g. collecting a torch allows the player to use energy to illuminate dark areas). Ammo is not universal, instead of blue orbs usable for all weapons, separate ammo is needed. Grenades are used instead of Amun mines. Some sprites are different (e.g. M60 machine gun), sprites are larger and more animated in general. Audible words are used for the player character instead of grunts. Mummies fire a &quot;white skull&quot; attack, or a partly homing red one, that when hit, turns the player into a mummy momentarily, additionally with the most powerful weapon in the game: the Mummy Staff, which can destroy all enemies within range of the player. The player reverts to normal once the weapon is used. Checkpoints are placed throughout the level by indication of golden scarabs and Saving is automatic between levels.<br/><br/>Levels are conducted in a more linear format. Players can replay previously completed levels, but later stages may only be played after completing the level prior. The Manacle of Power fires a lighting cloud above the enemy, rather than firing lighting bolts from the player's hands. Most of the artifacts from the console versions are not present (except the Sobek Mask, which is a spell). The powerups in the Sega Saturn version are included as spells (invisibility, invincibility and double damage). The Ring of Ra weapon is not included. Weapons pause to reload after a certain number of shots are fired. Some enemies have different death animations when killed by fire/grenades; bosses have longer death animations. There are extra lives instead of health extensions. The Amnit enemies are not included; instead there is the giant Ammut miniboss which has ramming and biting attacks. There is additional story text. The transmitter, which was a set of eight key items needed in the console versions to get the better ending, is not in the MS-DOS version per se, but it is seen before the final stage of the game, where the player receives orders to attack the Kilmaat ship. Likewise, the Team Dolls are not in the MS-DOS version.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerSlave PowerSlave]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "201873": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3052346.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["L.

There was now war between the King and his Parliament and the country was divided in its loyalties. The Royalists, who favor the King&rsquo;s cause, begin the war with many excellent troops and an advantage in cavalry troops, but have initial limited financial support from mostly towns and castles. Parliament starts with a somewhat reliable force in the London Trained Bands and a more solid financial backing from most of the kingdom&rsquo;s cities, but initial cavalry and leaders do not inspire confidence. Of course, the fortunes of war can change these circumstances over time.<br/><br/><br/>     Two Player game refighting what is often referred to as the First English Civil War. This Renaissance conflict is often identified in the &ldquo;Pike and Shot&rdquo; category, since musketeers fought around blocks of pike men for protection from cavalry. <br/>     Troop Types are represented with abstract counters. Infantry counters denote up to 1500 men and cavalry units represent up to 1000 men. There are units of dragoons and artillery trains as well. Special and elite units are also represented, such as the Northern Horse, Cornish Infantry, Lifeguards, and Hasselrigg&rsquo;s Lobsters. Both sides can also press Levies into service when necessary. <br/>     Game Boards display a map of England and most of Scotland. It is hex based with terrain within each and many prominent towns, cities, manor houses and castles are portrayed. Some of these locations have high fortification ratings and some do not. Necessary playing tables are located on the board for ease of play and necessary reference charts are provided to assist the players.  <br/>     Noteworthy Commanders are represented in the game, with holding boxes for leaders of larger armies. <br/>     Multiple Scenarios to play depending on when players want to begin and how long they want to play.  <br/><br/><br/>Game Features<br/><br/><br/>     Leader Driven - Play is divided into turns, but players move alternately, sometimes one going before the other a few times depending on circumstances. Leaders are the core to the game system with all actions being mostly conducted by them. Leaders have ability ratings for strategy and battle. Some also have special characteristics peculiar to them such as Impetuous, Financial Resources, Cavalry Commander, etc.  <br/>     Multiple Events Combination - These continuously have an effect on the game. This is provided by a combination of the turn chart, a random events table, and event counters. Event counters are played immediately on locations, leaders, or units and at times are deployed by the choice of a player. <br/>     Strategy Counters - These can be rolled for by leaders, and the larger their rating the better. This provides some uncertainty as well as advantages and disadvantages as appropriate to each case. Strategy counters can be played immediately or held for the duration of the turn for opportune moments.<br/>     Variable Combat System - Each side has a respective Battle Deck to add more panache to the Combat Result Table (CRT). The CRT gauges results based upon the size of the battle, so it is not one size fits all. <br/>     Scotland Shown - Many games on the English Civil War focus solely England and Wales. The necessary parts of Scotland are shown here to include the effects of Montrose&rsquo;s campaign on the war.<br/>     Attractive Coin Counters - Provided to help track paying for the cost of war.<br/><br/><br/>"}, "201913": {"poll": [], "name": "The Daring & the Doomed: The Elder Dooms", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Deck / Pool Building", "Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2016", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "average": "6.125", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "Golden Games"], "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Fantasy"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Prepare yourself for the mind-bending madness of The Elder Dooms!

Nasty goblins pour into the peaceful groves and villages of the elf world, setting the realm ablaze. Now you, the heroes, must quest in order to right this wrong. There are two paths to victory: closing the portal or slaying all the goblins. Which one will you choose? Either way, your quests will be aided by the help of the surviving mushroom folk &mdash; and by the epic items that have been lost in the realm's deep dungeons. The world is ending quickly, so you must act fast to save it, but you also need to know when your luck will run out...<br/><br/>In Tiny Epic Quest, players embark on a sandbox adventure reminiscent of classic video games. Each player controls a band of three elf heroes questing to save the world and the sacred mushroom folk from the intruding goblins.<br/><br/>Each round is broken into two phases: day and night. During the day, players travel far and wide, visiting villages to acquire quests, monuments to learn powerful spells, mushroom groves to seek guidance, and treacherous locations in search of artifacts! Acquiring artifacts empower the heroes with unique abilities; this may improve a heroes' movement or combat, or their ability to learn spells or mitigate harmful dice rolls.<br/><br/>Heroes must travel by foot, by horse, by raft, by boat and by gryphon to get to everywhere they need to go to satisfy their quests &mdash; or to position themselves for what night brings. As each type of movement is different, and limited, players need to take careful consideration when traveling, and how they travel, if they wish to accomplish all of their goals.<br/><br/>During the night, players must face the challenge of their quests, and decisions, by rolling dice, hoping for fortune, and knowing when to quit. Will you press on? Or is it time to save your progress and rest? Tomorrow is another day.<br/><br/>The game ends once the portal is closed or all the goblins have been eradicated.
