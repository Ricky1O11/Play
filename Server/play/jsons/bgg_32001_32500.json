Each family seeks to control one of four sectors (mining, industry, city, or commercial) while also striving to be Mayor to control the appointment of other players to offices.<br/><br/>The game takes place over three eras (turns/decades), each with multiple phases in which players are dealt eight cards &mdash; all with historic black-and-white photos from Colorado &mdash; and must discard one and bank two for their final turn. Cards are used to either play Municipal Muscle points to build, buy, or seize structures, or used for the &quot;event&quot; listed on every card. Cards can also be used to set yearly &quot;Headlines&quot; or &quot;Themes&quot; which evoke a movement in American society or technology and change VP awards or other variables in the game. Structures are scored by multiplying the amount the sector tracks have advanced by the number of buildings owned. Different tracks progress differently.<br/><br/>Finally, players can build parks, civic buildings, hospitals, and police stations. These buildings in turn affect further play and cause neighborhoods to have more political votes at turn's end, increase VPs for proximity, or protect against certain negative cards.<br/><br/>Forged in Steel is an organic building game in that all builds change the landscape and players may build only adjacent to where others have built &quot;the grid/network&quot;. At turn's end, the game decides how many immigrants come seeking jobs based on how many factories and commercial buildings were built that turn. Too many? Unrest grows and there could be a riot, undermining all of your recent city-building efforts. The National Guard will step in to help you, of course, but they are usually outnumbered, and there's often fighting in the streets, so be wary of not contributing to the &quot;Unrest Track&quot;.<br/><br/>Can your family negotiate the turbulent changes of the early 1900s and become the local political and economic powerhouse? From the New Deal, Women's Suffrage, City Beautiful and Spanish Flu, to sidewalks and paved streets, all aspects of a 1900s western American city are incorporated, and players will learn about the rise of those developments that changed cities, labor, industry, and society forever.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "7.49259", "name": "Forged in Steel", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Area Control / Area Influence", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Hand Management", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Variable Player Powers", "Voting"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "156", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Ep 018 \u2013 I, Geek interviews Don Lloyd", "Heavy Cardboard Episode 18 \u2013 Agricola", "Heavy Cardboard Episode 59 \u2013 December (2016) Briefing", "HLG 13: Terugblik op 2016", "The Game of Crowd Funding Wade Broadhead Interview 08-20-2014", "What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing", "What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing Week 11!"]}, "32004": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Chaos", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Point to Point Movement", "Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "54", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic269669_t.jpg", "average": "5.57963", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["MindWare"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic269669.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Mindware brown board edition 2007", "MindWare edition 2007"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Chaos - &quot;The fast-paced strategy game that's virtually unpredictable&quot;<br/><br/>You never know what's going to happen in this easy to learn game of strategy.

Other featured businesses are Behler-Young, Louis Padnos Iron and Metal Company, The Gilmore Collection, 1913 Room, Rockford Construction, Old Orchard, WZZM, Grand Valley State, Calvin College, and Aquinas College. The hotels will be shaped as the Amway Grand, and houses will represent the conservatory at the Frederick Meijer Gardens.

Official Site<br/><br/>Basically it's as above, players get hand full of cards, set down a house card (if they have one) put crap in it (making as many objects as they can) and capping off with the monster that belongs with the last object placed.  That is player A has 6 cards on his turn; A house, a band-aid, fish bones, rotten veggies, maggots, and the monster known as Slimon. He lays down the house card, followed by all of the item cards he has except the maggots. He can either end his turn or place the maggot card and the Slimon monster card to end that pile of cards from play to others except for the one monster that takes over any house. Basically the objects add up 5 points each and the first person to 100 wins the game.<br/><br/>"}, "32107": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Fanny Cherpe", "Olivier Mercier"], "average": "5.3487", "poll": [], "name": "Cro-Magnon", "playingtime": "50", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Acting"], "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "115", "maxplayers": "12", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic299552_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Bluguy", "Loops", "S\u00e9bastien Lopez"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Bioviva", "KOSMOS", "Laser plus", "University Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic299552.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch edition", "French edition", "German edition"], "maxplaytime": "50", "boardgamecategory": ["Prehistoric", "Word Game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "50", "description": "In this kind of themed &quot;Time's up&quot; game you have to adopt the eccentric habits of your tribe and evolve it (or fail).

The game&rsquo;s dynamic turn sequence captures the turmoil of the modern city fight and integrated fog of war keeps things chaotic and unpredictable!<br/><br/>Ambush Alley contains complete rules for all the key elements of modern counter-insurgency and street-fighting, including:<br/><br/><br/>     Civilians on the Battlefield <br/>     Full Vehicle Rules <br/>     Special Assets and Off-Board Support <br/>     Night Combat<br/>     UAVs <br/>     IEDs and VBIEDs <br/>     Building Clearing <br/>     And much more! <br/><br/><br/>Ambush Alley includes five scenarios and sample organizational charts for US, British, and Australian forces.<br/><br/>The game can be played at any scale from 15mm up. 15mm scenarios call for a 2&rsquo;x2&rsquo; table, while 28mm games only require a 4&rsquo;x4&rsquo; table.<br/><br/>Ambush Alley is easy on the pocketbook where miniatures are concerned. Few scenarios require more than ten figures for the Regular force and a dozen or so for the Insurgents.<br/><br/>Ambush Alley also offers full solo-play rules, so players can still have fun pushing their figures around the table even when a flesh and blood opponent isn&rsquo;t available!<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/><br/>     Ambush Alley: Day of the Rangers (2008)<br/>     Ambush Alley: Motor Pool (2007)<br/>     INVALID OBJECT ID=33973, type=thing (2007)<br/>     Ambush Alley: The Three Block War (2008)<br/>     Ambush Alley: Art of War (2008)<br/>     Ambush Alley: Operation \u2013 Darkstar (2008)<br/>     Ambush Alley: Under the Black Flag (2008)<br/>     Ambush Alley: Lawyers, Guns & Money (2008)<br/>     Ambush Alley: Indian Country (2009)<br/>     The Wasteland (2010)<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "name": "Ambush Alley", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Secret Unit Deployment"], "average": "7.99038", "boardgameexpansion": ["Ambush Alley: Art of War", "Ambush Alley: Day of the Rangers", "Ambush Alley: Indian Country", "Ambush Alley: Lawyers, Guns & Money", "Ambush Alley: Motor Pool", "Ambush Alley: Operation \u2013 Darkstar", "Ambush Alley: The Three Block War", "Ambush Alley: Under the Black Flag", "The Wasteland"], "usersrated": "52", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "age": "0", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Meeples &amp; Miniatures - Episode 66"]}, "32151": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Everett Sahrbeck"], "poll": [], "name": "Bold Adventure", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1982", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic255079_t.jpg", "average": "5.125", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Rock Harbor Creations"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic255079.jpg", "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Religious"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "From back of box:<br/><br/>Three centuries ago, a man named John Bunyan wrote an adventure narrative called Pilgrims Progress that has captured the imagination Western Christendom like no other book since the Bible.<br/><br/>Rock Harbor Creations has now brought the dramatic highlights of that perennial bestseller vividly to life in an exciting new board game called Bold Adventure.  Like the book's hero, Christian, you leave the City of Destruction behind on your way to the Cross, and ultimately to the Celestial City.  Like him, you'll go slowly at first, using the lower numbers on the inner circle of the spinner (there are no dice).  But once you reach the Cross and leave your burden there, again like him, you'll find your pace increases, as you shift to the higher numbers on the outer circle of the spinner.<br/><br/>Along the way, you'll meet Mr. Evangelist who'll warn you to avoid such perils as the Slough of Despond and Beelzebub's Castle, and beware the enticements of Vanity Fair.  Once you've made your way past Doubting Castle, and Giant Despair, you get a glimpse of your destination from the peak Delectable Mountain.<br/><br/>Designed to appeal especially to youngsters, bold adventure is a fast playing game for two to six players, taking no more than 30 to 45 minutes per game, on the average.  It is also easy to play; all you have to do is the old enough to read instructions and follow the directions on the board.  And, it is fun to play: the game is designed so that the lead will change frequently, and no one will be left too far behind.  There are also some interesting lessons to be learned in route.  For instance, if someone else lands on your space, instead of him having to go back to the beginning (disease or sending you there), you, being a good pilgrim say, &quot;Please go ahead of me,&quot; and he moves one space in front of you.  Similarly, lest you get discouraged at how far ahead the others are, there are three squares along the way marked &quot;The last shall be first&quot; -- land on one of these, and you immediately move one space in front of the leader.<br/><br/>Nor are you necessarily the winner if you arrive at the last square first, for there is still the River of Death to cross.  There are two ways to attempt that, as indicated on the River of Death cards in two random piles.  Draw a card and see if you: ford the river and enter the Celestial City, or except the invitation of Captain Vain-hope, to avoid getting your feet wet, and let him ferry you across.  Alas, if you choose the latter, his boat capsizes and you are swept down the river and over the falls into Perilous Pool.  When you climb out, you'll find that you have a fair ways to go before you again attempt across the river.<br/><br/>The first player to ford the river wins, but all pilgrims may enter the Celestial City if they embark on the bold adventure set before them.<br/><br/>"}, "32153": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jorge Arroyo"], "poll": [], "name": "Dungeon Builders", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Dice Rolling", "Modular Board", "Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Piecepack Games"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic255281_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)", "Piecepack Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic255281.jpg", "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Exploration", "Fantasy"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "This piecepack game has two phases: First all the players build a dungeon by placing rooms, monsters and items.

Each merchant is a member of a number of different Merchantile Companies: it is therefore important to achieve the best position in the hierarchies at the right time, when the profit from the expedition is divided among them, either by monopoly of a single company or by shares of different companies.<br/><br/>The same cards are used in three ways: to gain the control of a company on a certain harbour, to struggle for the status inside of a company, and finally as trade goods to collect to dispatch orders.<br/><br/>The game is the winner of the Best Unpublished Game contest of Lucca 2006.<br/><br/>The first limited edition has been published in form of a card game.<br/><br/>The current edition has been expanded with more rules and materials to become a board game, containing:<br/><br/>- 1 board<br/>- 60 shipment cards<br/>- 14 harbors<br/>- 18 merchants<br/>- 16 missions<br/>- 5 company rank markers<br/>- 5 summary cards<br/>- pirate&rsquo;s cove and pirate&rsquo;s ship<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["Abacus German Edition", "daVinci Games edition"], "age": "10", "name": "Borneo", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Set Collection", "Stock Holding"], "average": "5.61613", "usersrated": "155", "boardgamefamily": ["Miglior Gioco Inedito"]}, "32165": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic255556.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["G\u00fcnter Burkhardt"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2007", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Christof Tisch"], "boardgamepublisher": ["ABACUSSPIELE", "Corfix", "Rio Grande Games"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic255556_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Farming"], "description": "Darjeeling has two main board areas.  The first is an array of squares representing one, two or three half-crates of tea in four different varieties (colors).  Each player has a marker which moves about in the array, picking up tea at the rate of one square per turn.  There are simple rules governing movement in this array and the players compete for the desirable squares.<br/><br/>Eventually, several times per game, each player has enough squares of a single color to fit them together so that the half-crates all make whole crates.  Now he can make a tea shipment.  This pays off in victory points in three different ways.  First, there is a &quot;demand&quot; award of up to 6 VP depending on how long it has been since anyone shipped this variety.  Second, if the shipment was of at least four crates, there is a flat bonus of 1 VP per crate.<br/><br/>Third and most pivotally, there are VP that will be awarded at the beginning of the player's next and subsequent turns.  Each tea shipment is represented with cubes of the player's color (not the tea variety color) on a sort of barge.  The new shipment of tea is always placed, in the other of the two main board areas, at the top of a column of all the recent shipments (the number of total shipments varying with the number of players in the game), so that as more shipments are made, the old shipments drift farther down the column and eventually out of play.  At the beginning of your turn, you look to see where your shipments are in this column, and they pay out VP with better multipliers the higher they still are in the column.  This constitutes the driving force of the game, as nobody else wants to see your shipment at the top of the column for several turns in a row.  Players thus have an incentive to make a shipment even if they haven't yet assembled a large number of crates.<br/><br/>It's a race to 100 points.  A runaway leader can easily take over if the rest of the table is not vigilant, so the best games of Darjeeling are those among vigilant players.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition", "Rio Grande/Abacus international edition"], "average": "6.56745", "name": "Darjeeling", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Commodity Speculation", "Grid Movement", "Modular Board", "Set Collection"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "1206", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games", "Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: India", "Tea Games"]}, "32166": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Wizardology: Spells and Potions", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Trick-taking"], "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "12", "boardgamefamily": ["Ology board games"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic351792_t.jpg", "average": "4.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Sababa Toys, Inc."], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic351792.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From the back of the game:<br/><br/>&quot;Unleash your Wizardology skills to become Master Wizard in Spells and Potions, the Wizardology Card Game.

Some mystery of which they have personal knowledge, and to which, of course, they know the answer. Let me see, how many are we? One, two, three, four, five. We ought really to be six... (Joyce Lempri&eacute;re)<br/><br/>From this conversation in Agatha Christie&rsquo;s book &lsquo;The Tuesday Club Murders&rsquo;, a series of great detective stories come up, where perceptive characters rival Miss Marple, who teachs them a real lesson of shrewdness, explaining with talent and with all kind of misteries, no matter how strange or complicated they may be.<br/><br/>This game is exactly that: a narrative game based on the classic detective stories. A group of five players cooperate and compete to solve a mistery proposed by a sixth player, known as the host, trying to emulate Sherlock Holmes himself, from Arthur Conan Doyle&rsquo;s books. Host and players find themselves entwined in a complicated game of cat and mouse, where the first one propose a mysterious enigma and the others must solve it by racking their brains. For a length of an hour, as that is the time limit to solve the mistery, an intense (intellectual) battle is fought, where the host challenges the rest of the members of the Tuesday Club to find a solution that almost never is near or within reach. The armchair detectives will have to use in a creative way the clich&eacute;s with which their dramatic characters have been defined, and they will have to make the appropriate questions in order to find the solution.<br/><br/>Therefore, this is a game that puts the perceptiveness, intuition, and above all the logical and deductive intelligence of the participants to test. The constant interactivity among the players, the creation of intelligent questions with shrewdness, wit and creativity, and the dynamism of the intrigue make &lsquo;El Club de los Martes&rsquo; a perfect game to spend an hour of fun with family or friends.<br/><br/>El Club de los Martes is many games in one.<br/><br/><br/>=======<br/><br/>A narrative game of deduction and logic. All players are armchair detectives meeting every Tuesday to engage on some crime solving. A host presents the case and in turns each player can ask questions and use his or her special abilities to gather more information. Asking questions and gathering information cost money -every player starts the game with 15 pounds - paid to a common pool. Proposing a solution is very expensive and other players may benefit economically from you failures. Only one player may win, but the solution relies on the information gathered by the whole group with certain cooperatives aspects. If no detective solves the crime after one hour, nobody wins. The player with the &ldquo;first player&rdquo; token has the advantage because she starts every round; but if that player passes, she loses the token that goes to the next player.<br/><br/>Based in novel &quot;The Tuesday Club Murders&quot; by Agatha Christie.<br/><br/>Rules one are available in Spanish language.<br/><br/>"}, "32172": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Fort Apache", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "yearpublished": "1982", "usersrated": "9", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic255617_t.jpg", "average": "6.27778", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Nike and Cooper Espa\u00f1ola, S.A."], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic255617.jpg", "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["American Indian Wars", "American West", "Wargame"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "One of the first wargames published by NAC in Spain, and one of its easiest too.

After the fourth exterior corner tile has been placed, tiles may be replaced as well as placed, and the exit tile is shuffled into the draw pile.  The first player to the exit tile when it appears scores zero points.  Every other player gets points depending on how far their pawn is when the exit is reached by anyone.  The fewest points after a number of rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>The only board game to receive the Top Toy 2008 award from Toy Directory Monthly!

The other is that every turn has an alliance phase, in which the players may make or break alliances between their factions.

On their turn players push three new dancers to the dance floor from their own bar counter (edge of the game board) and as they come into play they push others towards the center of the dance floor. Once two dancers meet in the heat of the night they can be made into couples and the better the match the more players score. If only two of the four visible qualities match then the dancers have a one-night-stand which is not a very long term fun and is thus worth only one point. With three matching qualities the dancers actually like one another, start dating and that is worth four points. If all the four visible qualities match then the dancers get the &quot;happily ever after&quot; the one true love we all search for and thus it is worth full 5 points.<br/><br/>Each dancer also has a secret quality that can and will alter the basic score. For example if a guy has a large... &quot;personality&quot; then the player gets two extra points unless the other dancer is drunk, because if she is she wouldn't notice the difference. Girl's beautiful roommate on the other hand only has a function in the one-night-stands and the fun the couple would have means now triple fun and thus the player gets triple points. There are 12 different secret qualities in the game ranging from heart-broken to those who still live with their mom.<br/><br/>Occasionally the game gets spiced up by one of the three special charachters in the game. Bouncer can remove any of the dancer from the game board where as a Rock Star walks into the game normally, but once (s)he has gathered a fan crowd and he's completely surrounded player can take the Rock Star and four adjacent dancers back to his hotel room and form two couples out of them.

Players place chips on their matrix cards, Bingo-style, until every player has at least one complete row or column of chips.  At this point, players choose from among the 3- and 4-digit numbers filled in on their cards to establish &quot;flight numbers,&quot; which are written on their sheets.<br/><br/>In the &quot;Establishing a Flight Path&quot; phase, players are dealt cards from a second deck of &quot;base cards.&quot;  Some of these cards contain game-balancing bonuses and penalties which apply only when drawn by players holding specially-marked matrix cards.  The remaining base cards list a planet of the solar system, the number base that the planet represents in the game, and a list of digits which are valid in the planet's base.  For example, Mercury represents binary (base 2), so only digits 0 and 1 are allowed.  The player replaces all illegal digits in his or her flight number with zeroes, then converts the resulting number to decimal using a special base conversion wheel included with the game (except for landings on Pluto, which already represents base 10 and requires no conversion).  The final result is added to his or her score.<br/><br/>The game includes two sets of rules -- &quot;Brief Instructions&quot; which get players started in just two pages, and a 10-page &quot;Guide Book&quot; which includes more detailed instructions, game variations and mathematical background information.  The game was filed as U.S. Patent 3,618,952.<br/><br/>"}, "32398": {"boardgamedesigner": ["R.

The goal of the game is to have each of your thims on the last four squares of the board.  The player can use the blue arrows to advance up the board if he lands on one and if he lands on a square with a red arrow must slide to the bottom of the arrow.  There are some special squares that force the player to roll a six to move past that square and some that allow the player to roll the dice again.  The most interesting square on the board is the STYMIE square.  If a person gets his thim to land on the STYMIE square no other player may move their thims past him until he moves his thim.  This makes for a burst for the finish ending in many games.  Players may move any of their thims on their turn including ones that may be buried in a stack of other thims as long as they take all thims resting on top of theirs.

These secret identities are revealed throughout the course of the game.  Cops attempt to make an arrest.  Killers attempt to kill their target.  Bystanders can help influence the outcome one way or the other.<br/><br/>A more informative description: The game comes with a full set of english rules already and its game components are fully language independent.<br/><br/>Cop &amp; Killer is an interactive game for up to 10 players, where the gameplay focuses on a Killer trying to kill his Target and the Cop tries to capture the Killer before he is on his victim. At the beginning each player randomly receives hidden an identity marker which identifies him either as the Cop, the Killer, the Target or a Bystander. These identity badges are kept by the players in their hands under the table, and before a game round starts the players can secretly exchange the badges on a one to one base so that nobody knows the true identity of the others. The ID badges come in different shapes to avoid looking at the badges while exchanging them, so that the players know which badge they are holding, so there is no need for them to look at them under the table.<br/><br/>When the badges have been assigned by the players, the meeple in form of a bullet is placed on the gameboard and playing commences. In turn, the players now roll a set of a red and a blue dice, and they may move the bullet clockwise around the board for a number of spaces corresponding to the number rolled with one of the dice. During the course of the game, the identities of the players may be revealed, and when this has happened to Cop, Killer or Target their rules for using the dice will be slightly changed. So, the Cop now must use only the blue dice and moves the bullet clockwise, but he may decide to move less spaces than rolled by the dice, to simulate the chosen path of investigation (coffee ? Yes or no?). The Killer on the other hand uses the red dice and must move the exact number of spaces, but he may chose to go clockwise or counter-clockwise. Finally, the Target may use the result of one or both dice and move the bullet clockwise around the board.<br/><br/>On the gameboard, the players will encounter a number of spaces which allow them to perform an action, but before describing those actions let me say a little bit more about the mechanics of the gameboard. So, each action space either has a blue or red background colour, depending on whether the action is beneficial for the Cop or the Killer. A player who lands on such a space and performs the action afterwards takes a coin of the corresponding colour, representing either a reward for helping the Police or a bribe for helping the Killer. When the round ends, either the Cop or the Killer will have been successful, earning the player of Cop or Killer one victory point. However, in addition the two players (Bystanders) who helped the successful Cop or Killer most and earned most coins of the winning colour also will be awarded one victory point, and then a new round of play will start until all 10 victory points of either Cop or Killer have been distributed.<br/><br/>At this place, it becomes important to notice that the gameboard is double sides and can be flipped from a side depicting the Cop's office to the Crime Scene and backwards. The side with the Cop's office shows more actions which are beneficial for the Cop and the players who have chosen to assist him, whereas the side of the Crime Scene features more red actions which can be used by the Killer and his henchmen. The change of both sides of the gameboard is triggered by one space on each side, featuring either a car key or an office key, and the player who move the bullet onto the corresponding space flips the gameboard over and receives a correspondingly coloured coin.<br/><br/>The action blue spaces which are favourable for the Cop and his assisting players are the following:<br/><br/>* Circumstancial Evidence: the active player may chose any other player- That player must reveal his identity.<br/>    * Successful Investigation: The Cop has finished his investigations. All identity markers are uncovered.<br/>    * Interrogation: The active player may chose another player and ask him a direct question which must be answered truthfully by &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. It may be asked whether the questioned player has a specific identity, and if this turns out to be true the player's identity must be revealed. However, the question may also be of a more indirect nature, only asking whether a player would try to assist the Killer during his next turn etc. In this case, no identity marker will be revealed, but the questioned player is bound to his answer on his following turn.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the following red spaces are more useful for the Killer:<br/><br/>* Informant: The active player may ask an other player whether he is the Target. If this is ture, the Traget must reveal his identity.<br/>    * Betrayal: The player entering this space must reveal his own identity.<br/>    * Target in sight: The Target must reveal its identity.<br/><br/>When Cop or Killer are revealed, they discard all coins they have collected during this round, since from now onwards they are pursuing their own aims which are not quite congruent with those of the Bystanders. However, until then they should collect coins and normal, and they possibly have the chance to put the other players onto a wrong track by the colour of coins they collect.<br/><br/>Finally, there are also a blue and a red action space which lead to the climate of the round: the blue Arrest space and the red Assault space. For an Arrest, the identities of Cop and Killer must be revealed, whereas an Assault needs Killer and Target to be revealed. If the Cop or the Killer decide to act, two dice are rolled, and if the acting player (Cop in case of Arrest, Killer in case of Assault) rolls a higher result on his dice than on the other dice, he may shoot that number of arrows with the included Dartgun at a target marker which has been set up at a chosen distance. If one of the darts hits, the round is over and the shooting player and his two best assistants will have won, but if no hit was scored the game continues. However, if the shooting was successful and if, after the distribution of victory points, all ten victory points of one colour have been used up, the game ends and the player with most victory points will have won.<br/><br/>Wow, this game plays astonishingly well, and the playing mechanism certainly is not just a vehicle which forms the background for some otherwise senseless dartgun shooting. Quite the opposite, the gameplay is quite multi-faceted and offers a good degree of playing depth which is somewhat counterbalanced by the interactive element of shooting. The guessing and deduction of the players starts at the end of a round when the identity markers have to be exchanged, since no player may keep the badge of Cop, Killer or Target for two consecutive rounds. Depending on the positioning of the players around the table, each player may make some first deductions on who might now have which identity badge. During the game itself, it will be especially the Bystanders who will try to spoil an early victory of Cop or Killer, since they first want to collect enough coins to participate in the distribution of victory points at the end of the round. So, it will always be a few players who want to move for ending the round, while the others want to postpone the inevitable end until the get into a better position themselves. For this reason, especially the Interrogation action is rather useful, since a player who is asked a question is bound to his answer on his following turn. This may lead to a considerable restriction of his actions, depending on the way a question is asked.<br/><br/>The extensive care which was put into this game is reflected by the artwork, the components (including a very robust and seemingly durable dartgun from a German manufacture) and the body of the rules. Special provisions for only four players for teamplay with 7 to 10 players are included, as well as a full English version of the rules. Even the details are harmonious, with a real-looking bullet as a playing piece and a carboard-piece resembling a yellow &quot;Police Line&quot; which is used to mark off the line after which the shooter must stand. To my mind, Cop &amp; Killer is a really outstanding interactive group game, and with people who do not mind the somewhat violent topic really thrilling games should be possible.<br/><br/>Most of the text is originally written by kulkmanns gamebox as a review by Frank Schulte-Kulkmann on boardgame.de<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "4", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "Cop & Killer", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Variable Player Powers"], "average": "4.97619", "boardgameexpansion": ["Cop & Killer Expansion Tatort New York (Crimescene NY)"], "usersrated": "21", "age": "10"}, "32461": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Norman Golledge"], "poll": [], "name": "Rummy 400", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "1993", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Rummy Games"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic262516_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Cardboard games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic262516.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Deduction"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Rummy 400 <br/>&quot;This great new board game makes for more runny excitement.

Quite soon, it became evident that the Finns, despite totally outnumbered, were not an easy match. They were better equipped for the cold winter to come than the opponent. Ski capability was high and moving in deep forest was no problem. On the other hand, the Soviet troops were scared to death of the forest and stayed as close as possible to the few roads.<br/><br/>The Motti (Finnish term for &ldquo;encirclement&rdquo;) tactic became famous around the world and a great sympathy for the small country up in the north grew in many countries as the war went on. Soon, places like Suomussalmi, Tolvaj&auml;rvi, Kuhmo and Kollaa, to name a few, became famous for the heroic Finns fighting against overwhelming odds.<br/><br/>The situation was not good for Stalin and his communist regime. Allied intervention was very possible and the prestige over the greatest army to date, The Red Army, was shaking. He also knew that Hitler was studying the campaign very carefully, making notes for every weakness in the old and poor doctrine of the RKKA.<br/><br/>On March 13th, 1940, Finland had no other choice but to agree on the tough peace terms to follow. The Winter War had ended, but who won, or was it a stalemate? However, Finland kept its independence because the mighty neighbour in the east failed to take Helsinki among other vital objects, as planned.<br/><br/>The Game<br/>The first game of the trilogy to be released is the famous Winter War between Finland and Soviet Union, which is often referred to as an epic battle between David and Goliath. Historically the campaign lasted for 105 days, but will you as the Finnish side be able to last that long, or maybe longer? The game can last up to 16 turns (Dec. I '39 - Mar. IV '40), but in the 3rd volume (The Lapland War), there will be an extended option with a possible Allied Intervention. Vol.1 Winter War will include special features like Soviet Prestige and Finnish Morale.<br/><br/>The object for the Soviet side is to capture as many important cities and factories as possible, as well as destroy the Finnish Army in an attempt to make the Finnish Morale Status plunge, which means the onset of peace negotiations. But time is not on the Red Army's side, a slow advance lowers the Soviet prestige, which can cause a negative outcome.<br/><br/>Unit Counters<br/>The game will include eight countersheets in a total of 2.128 die-cut unit counters.

The almost 200.000 men strong German &ldquo;Armee Norwegen&rdquo;, operating in northern Finland is part of Hitler&rsquo;s operation plan Barbarossa. Finland and Germany are fighting two separate wars against the same enemy. Finnish units reached their objectives in late December, 1941, and a static period in the war began (also called the &ldquo;Trench War&rdquo;). In the summer of 1944, the Soviet Red Army launched a major offensive in the Karelian Isthmus after the withdrawal of the German &ldquo;Heeresgruppe Nord&rdquo; from the Leningrad area. This time the Finnish units couldn&rsquo;t hold back the thrust. Viipuri (Vyborg) was lost and the situation was critical. The largest battle in the Northern Europe took place in Tali-Ihantala, where German Stukas supported the Finnish units. Like a miracle, the Finns and Germans managed to halt the Soviet onslaught, and because Stalin was eager to reach Berlin before the Americans, he decided to withdraw a number of units from the Finnish front. Finland was again saved by the bell.<br/><br/>The Game<br/>The second game of the trilogy is the largest. Now the Germans make an entrance with a wide variety of units and special rules. The Soviet side gets the Guards units as well as numerous of new air unit types. The grande campaign 1941-1944, can take up to 155 turns! Relax, in the middle of the campaign, approximately from Jan. I '42 to Jun. I '44, there will be a special feature, called the Position War (Entrenchment War), which will speed up the playing considerably.<br/><br/>There are also two shorter scenarios included, that suites very well for introduction; the 1941-scenario (Jun. IV '41 &ndash; Dec. IV '41 = 26 turns) and the 1944-scenario (Jun. II '44 &ndash; Sept. I '44 = 12 turns).

This was a bold surprise attack in the Germans back, the former brother in arms. Since September 4th, 1944, Finland was no longer at war with the Red Army, as the so called Continuation War had ended. One tough part of the peace terms was, that all German units were to be handed over to the Soviet Union. Because this was impossible, due to the fact that there was over 210.000 Germans in the northern Finland, the former brothers in arms had to fight each other under the supervision of the Soviet control commission. In the Barents Sea region, in an attempt to crush the German &ldquo;20.Gebirgs-Armee&rdquo; once and for all, the Soviet Army launched a large-scale attack called the Petsamo-Kirkenes Operation.

Games end when one side achieves its objectives or breaks due to mounting casualties.<br/>Each side operates several units. A unit represents either a company (60 men) or a battalion (600 men) and normally comprises three stands (or bases) of troops that always remain in contact. <br/>Officers and generals are represented by individual bases. Their role is to give their units or groups of units (called brigades) orders. Each officer and general has a command value assigned&mdash;a higher command value indicates a more capable officer and general.<br/>The crux of the game is the activation system. The player with the initiative (i.e., whose turn it is) identifies an officer or general and the unit(s) the officer or general wishes to order. <br/>Shooting is resolved with a single die roll (but many dice!) while melee requires a single competing die roll.
