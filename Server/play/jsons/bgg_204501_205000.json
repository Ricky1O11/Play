They are here to compete for acceptance amongst the general public and gain admiration and respect from fellow writers.  Success within these circles requires extreme levels of merit, however Lope de Vega has organised a public competition, in honor of San Isidro, so that novice poets can rub shoulders with the greats and perhaps even earn a place amongst them.<br/><br/>In El Soneto players take the role of these novice poets who aspire to win Lope de Vega&rsquo;s competition. In order to do this, each player must choose letter cards that are displayed within the famous gossip mills of Madrid, and with them they must create words for three rounds whilst respecting the grammatical rules that each of these rounds permits. Prestige will be given in a number of ways to players for their words: direct points for the number of letter cards used; favor of the benefactors if the word begins with one of the three letters that the benefactors have asked for; support of the writers if the word has employed one or more of the permitted literary devices; or they can advance on the Soneto marker if their words rhyme.<br/><br/>The literati and the benefactors that each player has earned throughout the game will be awarded additional prestige points at the end, in addition to the level reached on the rhyme marker. He who achieves the most prestige points is declared the winner of the competition.<br/><br/>Description in Spanish:<br/>En su Viaje al Parnaso, adem&aacute;s de a Lope de Vega, Quevedo o G&oacute;ngora, Miguel de Cervantes fue reclutando a otros muchos literatos para luchar contra los malos poetas; &iquest;te habr&iacute;a gustado formar parte de semejante grupo?

Negotiate, bluff, forge alliances, threaten your rivals &mdash; use every tool at your disposal to spread your influence, establish supremacy, and claim the ultimate prize: the Iron Throne!<br/><br/>In more detail, each turn centers around the resolution of an encounter between two players. These encounters can result in hostilities, startling conquests, and the spread of influence, or they can result in the formation of temporary alliances. And though only two players in any encounter will be the &quot;active&quot; players, your friends might offer you their support &mdash; or turn around and offer it to someone else.<br/><br/>The encounters of The Iron Throne resolve quickly, but they are full of opportunities for cunning strategy, devious intrigues, and brokered alliances. Each features a challenger and a defender, and after these players assign characters to resolve the encounter on the behalf of their Houses, other players may offer their support to either side. In this way, an encounter that starts as a contest between the Lannisters and the Starks may escalate and draw in the support of the Tyrells or other Houses.<br/><br/>However, there's more to the encounters of The Iron Throne than this initial jostling for power, even with all the alliances and betrayals it can entail. There are still schemes within schemes, and the bluffs, negotiations, and hidden information that color these encounters as the active players discuss the House cards they intend to play. Of course, there's a very good chance that one or both of them may be lying, but they can offer and even agree to a truce. Or they can bid cards from their hands, hoping to win hostilities with the higher total power.<br/><br/>In the event of a truce, the active players discuss what they may give each other in order to maintain the peace. In the event of hostilities, however, one side will win, and the other will suffer. You might seize influence or take hostages, or you may even have your characters put to the sword.<br/><br/>Win enough of these encounters, though &mdash; and find the right ones to lose &mdash; and you might find yourself in position to seize the Iron Throne. The goal of the game is to spread five of your influence to your opponents' House cards and take the crown for yourself.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "Greek first edition", "Spanish first edition"], "average": "7.1369", "name": "Game of Thrones: The Iron Throne", "playingtime": "60", "age": "18", "boardgameexpansion": ["220931"], "usersrated": "248", "boardgamefamily": ["A Song of Ice and Fire"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 024 \u2013 Top 10 iOS Games", "Episode 31: The Networks Review + Gencon 2016 Preview", "The Polyhedron Collider Cast Episode 9"]}, "204838": {"rpgdesigner": ["John Healy, II"], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Standing Stones", "rpgartist": ["Sierra Patheal"], "rpgproducer": ["Katie Healy", "Richard McAllister", "Sierra Patheal"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3109731.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Glass Goblin Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3109731_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>A tomb.

But sometimes, it can be fun to take on the mantle of the otherworldly, and to embrace the alien terrors of the cosmos. Each installment of Weekly Wonders: Eldritch Archetypes contains five archetypes for eldritch characters&mdash;those that are weird, alien, and otherworldly, who don&rsquo;t fit in with normal society&mdash;as well as a cleric domain devoted to a specific mythos entity or race.<br/><br/>For this book, we focus on the Great Old One Shub-Niggurath, also known as The Black Goat of the Woods, and the Black Goat with a Thousand Young. Whether or not they reference this mythos deity directly, each archetype builds on themes closely associated with it, including physical mutations, fertility, and spawning horrible monstrosities. The Shub-Niggurath bloodrager bloodline grants tentacles and sucking maws while bloodraging, and ultimately allows you to infest foes with Shub-Niggurath&rsquo;s hateful seed. The order of the black goat is a cavalier order devoted to Shub-Niggurath, whose mounts become twisted and warped by the eldritch entity&rsquo;s power, and who share a mind with these corrupted steeds. The gof&rsquo;nn hupadgh are druids dedicated to the service of Shub-Niggurath, who can conjure her unnatural young to their sides, and even create dark young. The channeler of Shub-Niggurath is a kineticist archetype that draws on the strange, life-giving essence of Shub-Niggurath to empower their channeling, and the warstitcher of Shub-Niggurath is a warpriest archetype for those blessed by the black goat, which can cause protective pustules to grow with her fervor, and can conjure twisted aberrations to aid her. Finally, the Shub-Niggurath cleric domain focuses on using one&rsquo;s own flesh to conjure hideous and tentacled monstrosities.<br/><br/>Whether you're about to embark on a campaign of eldritch horror (such as the official Paizo adventure path dealing with strange and alien entities), or you just want an excuse to play a servant of the unknowable and uncaring cosmic entities of the Cthulhu mythos, this book has lots of tantalizing options to offer. Even GMs can get in on the fun, as several of the archetypes here are perfect for insane cultist NPCs as well, and can make for exciting and memorable encounters.<br/><br/>"}, "204845": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jonathan Geruntho"], "average": "7.5", "poll": [], "name": "As Seen in the Sky", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Deck / Pool Building", "Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3134960_t.png", "boardgameartist": ["Nick Kienzle", "Hannah Kienzle"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Rookling Inc."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3134960.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Educational", "Nautical"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>You and your fellow midshipmen are fresh recruits on a British frigate heading to the West Indies.

Hell Island: Great Adventure of 7 Islands) is an action-adventure game developed for the Famicom and MSX home computer, and released by Capcom in 1987.

Neither the arcade game, nor this adventure adaptation were released outside Japan, although a prototype exists for a canceled North American NES release, where it was to be renamed &quot;Makai Island&quot;.<br/><br/>In Higemaru Makaijima, the hero from Pirate Ship Higemaru named Momotaru must now pilot his own sailing vessel around the ocean surrounding seven islands. His goal is to find the greatest treasure. To do this, he must collect the keys which open the dock gates to each of the islands by invading several pirate ships and defeating the captain on board in combat. The gameplay on these pirate ships are taken directly from the arcade predecessor, with some small modifications.<br/><br/>Once Momotaru has collected a key from a pirate ship, he must then sail around the islands in search of the correct dock gate which the key corresponds to. Once there, the player embarks on an exploration of the island to find items, defeat a boss, and collect treasures before heading off in search of another island key.

After that, each partner rolls only for his own drawing.<br/><br/>The first player to complete a drawing yells &quot;Gooffy&quot; and the players then tally their individual scores (one point per body part). The two highest scorers move to the next table for another round, and the game continues for as many as 12 rounds. The player with the highest total points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>The giraffe needs a tail (4), a neck (3), two ears and an eye (2) and four legs (1). The penguin needs a beak (4), one eye (3), two feet (2) and two flippers (1).

It can bolster a burning passion, inspire the meek to bravery, and sooth a cluttered mind. Wandering bards have mastered the art of creating music to shape and manipulate the minds and hearts of the world through song, words, and instrument. However, it is the Maestro who has learned to evoke music from the natural world around them and weave these notes with arcane skill into melodies of dynamic and potent magic.<br/><br/>With but a raised hand or wand, a Maestro listens for the clang of arms on armor, the heavy footfalls of a giant, the crackle of a bolt of lightning, and catches them, crafting them into a symphony of rousing musical movements. They conduct the sounds of the battlefield like a phantom orchestra, empowering the blows of their allies, altering the minds and moods of their opponents, and changing the pace of the fray in their favor.<br/><br/>The College of the Maestro calls to those who enjoy enabling their companions to become even more effective and dangerous to their enemies. It refines those of raw talent into majestic performers who can pluck the thoughts from a mind like a musical note, amplify the fears of lesser beings through sourceless, ominous tones, and seemingly stretch time by commanding the tempo of a heartbeat. Maestros become heroes who can take the chaos of the world and carve it as they see if by controlling the vibrations of music that subtly guide the realm.&quot;<br/><br/>The College of the Maestro is a new Bardic College option to the Bard class, available at 3rd level. It plays as a more support-focused Bard, with additional utility for their Bardic Inspiration feature to alter and manipulate the battlefield in small ways.

Would you like to enable allies options to enhance their attacks? Perhaps you'd enjoy sutble healing and defense benefits for all around you?

We find them in films, on posters, in commercials, on snack foods, and even as action figures.  Our societies flirt and play with villains at a safe distance, and we adore them.  That same sense of awe and wonder can be captured by a player roleplaying an evil character.  It does not work for all gaming groups, but for those able to handle it, the experience can be rewarding.<br/><br/>This product can serve several purposes.  Some game groups dabble in evil adventures as a one-shot or short run campaign.  Others want to experiment with evil characters and add one or two in to see how it affects the game.  Still others fully embrace evil characters and find they sometimes need replacement characters after a sudden and unexpected character death.  For whatever reason you need a ready-to-play character sheet, this product is for you.<br/><br/>Welcome to Wicked Wanderers!  In this product, you will discover twenty complete stat blocks for a single PC, level 1 through 20, adhering to the Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game rules.  The core format adheres to the standard non-player character (NPC) stat block most GMs are already familiar with minus the Tactics section.  This makes it easier for the GM to assist with finding information and also prepares the player for the day he or she is running games!  The Special Abilities section includes more detailed write-ups of feats and character abilities than a standard NPC stat block to facilitate faster play.  Sources for spells, races, classes, archetypes, and prestige classes from sources other than the Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook&trade; (PZO1110) are listed in the Sources section and can be referenced in the Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game Reference Document.<br/><br/>On Evil Characters<br/><br/>Evil neither means &ldquo;stupid&rdquo; nor &ldquo;irrational.&rdquo;  Some evil campaigns implode because characters mistake an evil alignment for the inability to ever follow a rule or make a decision for the greater good.  Evil is an absent or inhibited sense of responsibility for the hurtful consequences of one&rsquo;s own actions for society or individuals that can lead to actions others would deem &ldquo;wrong.&rdquo;  This does not mean an evil character does not feel love or value lawful society or desire the betterment of mankind.  In the real world, there are many evil people who would never consciously describe themselves as such.  Evil characters can work together and form bonds of friendship.  They possess many of the same insecurities, fears, hopes, dreams, and goals as other people; however, they are more willing to go to extremes to fulfill their needs.  An evil character may disregard laws in his pursuit of his desires, but in a roleplaying game setting the player still must abide by the rules of the game:  the game is about the shared story of every character and each story is equally important.  Play the evil character, and have fun!  Make sure you allow your fellow players to have fun as well.<br/><br/>"}, "204976": {"poll": [], "name": "H.U.N.T", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "videogamefranchise": ["Unity Store Games"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Kylotonn"], "videogamegenre": ["Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Plug In Digital"], "description": "Choose your hunt and upgrade his skills and weapon in-game to protect the colonies from the arachnides and others monsters.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "204977": {"poll": [], "name": "Deutschland's Kolonien-Spiel", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1890", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Germany"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Deutschland's Kolonien-Spiel (&quot;Germany's Colonies Game&quot;) is a game published in Germany around 1890, in which players move tokens around a map to visit different German colonies, paying to see the sites and learn about these places.<br/><br/>It's a roll and move racing game - first player to reach the China space wins.<br/><br/>"}, "204978": {"poll": [], "name": "Intergalactic Bubbles", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows/Macintosh/Linux Downloadable Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3111312.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Abstract", "Space"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Hellscape Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Linux", "Macintosh", "Windows"], "average": "5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Epic Quest Games"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3111312_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Match 'bubbles' as they descend en masse from above, trying to do so before they crash on you and in as few moves as possible.<br/><br/>"}, "204979": {"poll": [], "name": "Where's Olaf?", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Memory"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3113290_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Wonder Forge"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3113290.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Memory"], "age": "4", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Join your friends from Disney Frozen in a clever game of hide-and-seek!

Flying saucers are abducting innocent people off the streets and returning them corrupted and changed. It has become impossible to tell apart harmless civilians from vile alien scum.<br/><br/>Deep inside of an underground bunker is a team of humans trying desperately to stop the attacks. They have developed a cure to the alien parasite to transform humans back to normal, but are unable to mass produce it. As they try to gather the supplies necessary to save the planet, it becomes clear that some among them cannot be trusted&hellip; and have more nefarious plans in mind.<br/>Each player receives a secret role and either works with the Humans to mass produce a cure or joins the Aliens<br/>in the construction of a Doomsday Device. The fate of the world hangs in the balance.<br/><br/>Each player has two features: Status and Role.<br/><br/>Status - whether you are a Human or Alien. This is the team that you are playing for.<br/><br/>Role - many of which have special powers.<br/><br/>Once Roles and Status Cards are given out players take turns, moving clockwise, and on each turn they start by drawing an Adventure Card from the deck.<br/><br/>Adventure Cards can drastically change the course of the game. Amongst the many possibilities, players can be abducted and become aliens, thrown into a state of suspended animation, or even probed which renders them silent. Ultimately the Humans are searching the deck to claim Humanity Cards while the Aliens are looking for Doomsday Cards.<br/><br/>Many Adventure Cards state that they are Immediate Action and must be played right away, for better or worse. Any card that is not immediate can be played at any point, even on another&rsquo;s turn. If you save a card for later keep it facedown and secret. Some cards will change your own status of being a Human or Alien, and if this change happens keep it hidden.<br/><br/>When a Humanity or Doomsday Card is drawn it is shown instantly and the player that drew it must decide who gets to hold onto it. They may select him/herself. The owner of the card can freely give it to another player at any point, and they can also lose their card in a variety of ways. Players can hold either type of card, Humanity or Doomsday, regardless of their own status. This allows players to hold cards hostage from the other team. There are two copies of each card within the deck, but only one of each type is needed to win.<br/> Human Victory: Have one Human player hold all three types of Humanity Cards - Alien Specimen, Chemical Stockroom, and Medical Laboratory<br/><br/>Alien Victory: Have one Alien player hold all three types of Doomsday Cards - Black Hole Bomb, Perpetual Motion Drive, and Quantum Reactor<br/><br/>As each Humanity and Doomsday card is found it becomes more and more important that they are placed in safe hands, but in Invasion Evasion the teams can constantly change.

They have seen the rise and fall of countless minor deities, and even those who are mighty, like Selmiral the Morningstar, Lord of Two Crystals. And yet, such power does the Golden Goliath consist of, that still he lives on, mindless and blind, a giant mass of incarnate divinity floating through the nether void.<br/><br/>Would that he had worshippers, to sing songs of his glory, to partake of his mana, to make his thoughts a reality upon the material plane. But lo, see what misfortune has befallen this lord of antiquity! For only those fiends of the Cult of Chaos pay him any heed in this fallen age, and there are few who despise the servitude of religion more than they.<br/><br/>"}, "204650": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3195558.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Mat\u00fa\u0161 Kotry"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["David Cochard", "Jakub Politzer"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Cranio Creations", "Czech Games Edition", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "REBEL.pl"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3195558_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy"], "boardgamehonor": ["2016 Golden Geek Best Board Game Expansion Nominee"], "description": "Alchemists: The King's Golem, an expansion to Alchemists, brings you a new logic puzzle with new rewards and consequences.

It's a gateway deck building game that is suitable for children, families, and casual players.<br/><br/>You begin the game by drawing 3 active heroes from a stack of 9, and draw a hand of 5 cards from the deck you&rsquo;ve created, probably including cards that have synergies with your heroes.<br/><br/>Your hero team will face off against all the other hero teams. When a hero is defeated, you draw a replacement. You win the game by defeating all the rival heroes.<br/><br/>Each hero has a special innate power that can be used during a turn instead of playing a card from your hand. Hero powers offer interesting gameplay options and strategies that complement  the comical &quot;theme&quot; of the hero. For instance, a hero called The Quitter has the power to quit, which is funny, but it&rsquo;s also an advantage because you can bring back a more desirable defeated hero. Each hero belongs to one of four power types: Nature, Mutant, Gadget, or Magic, which is the root of their powers.<br/><br/>Other card types include:<br/><br/>Smash cards: the most basic way for a hero to attack a rival hero.<br/>Super cards: Supers are more powerful attacks and abilities that are unique for each hero.<br/>Story cards: these tend to affect multiple teams and introduce some narrative context to the game: dinosharks busting out of the lab, black holes sucking up active heroes, giant fart monsters, alien invasions, and so on.<br/>Loot cards: these cards can be equipped to a hero to increase their powers or protect them from story cards. Example: Thor&rsquo;s Thunderpants lets you draw the equipped hero&rsquo;s Super card.<br/>Team-Up cards: more powerful than Smash cards, but they require two heroes (hence the teaming up).<br/><br/>"}, "204659": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3107665.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Bussaco 20"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["R.

One player commands the French army under Napoleon's brother, Joseph, the self-proclaimed King of Spain, and the other commands the combined allied armies of Great Britain (under Sir Arthur Wellesley) and Spain (under Captain-General Gregorio de la Cuesta). After his attempt to liberate Madrid from the French was repulsed, Cuesta's army fell back to Talavera, which was covered by the British. Starting with a daring night attack, Joseph repeatedly attempted to push the allies out of their superb defensive positions, to no avail.

As the allies, can you hold your shaky alliance together and fend off the French (all the while keeping a nervous eye out for a second French army that might unexpectedly show up behind your armies)?<br/><br/>Bussaco 20: Second Edition, from designer Lance McMillan, features the battle occurring on 26 September 1810, during the early stages of the French invasion of Portugal.

Players have the option to use either virtual joystick and button controls or tap-based controls. During a level, players have the option to use normal attacks as well as more powerful skills unique to each hero. Some skills have cooldowns lasting as long as 30 seconds. Players travel in a three-hero team, with the player able to switch between heroes at any time during a game, although if you switch from Hero 1 to Hero 2, you will have to wait a bit before being able to switch back to Hero 1.<br/><br/>There are multiple kinds of missions: Villain Siege, in which players form a 3-man team to battle a boss, Daily Missions, mini-stories that change every day, Story Missions, which are part of the main storyline, Special Missions, side missions with stories based on the Guardians of the Galaxy and Marvel's Ant-Man, and World Boss, in which players form a 3-man team and 5-man support team to battle one of multiple special bosses. Story Missions allow the use of clear tickets, which instantly gives the players the rewards for completing the mission without having to play through it. Each type of mission provides a mixed pool of rewards. Special Missions, World Boss, and Story Missions provide level-exclusive Biometrics, Daily Missions provide ISO-8, and Villain Siege provides a mixed pool. There are four types of Arena Battles: Timeline Battles are 3-man team PvP battles; Team-Up Play, a co-op battle with up to 3 online players on a team. Battleworld, a once-daily event usually limited to teams with 4*-6* heroes; Alliance Battle, available once you have joined an alliance, a once-daily event that rewards xp for the alliance as well as rewards for the player.<br/><br/>Each mission uses energy to play. Energy is gained by leveling up your SHIELD base, or through in game rewards and achievements. There are over 60 different playable heroes, each with unique skills and attacks. The player can have a maximum of 5 teams set up. There are also team bonuses, which, if the player has certain members on the team give buffs to the team members. Heroes are unlocked and ranked up by obtaining Biometrics, which can be found in certain missions as well as the shop. Heroes can also be leveled up through the use of EXP chips. Players are able to customize heroes to their playstyle, such as upgrading skills, gear, and equipping ISO-8 gems. Upgrading skills makes them do more damage, upgrading gear improves a specific part of the hero, like HP or Attack Speed, and equipping ISO-8 provides varying buffs. In the shop, in addition to Biometrics, players can also buy chests, energy, clear tickets, ISO-8, Biometric packages, and other supplies. There is a separate store for uniforms. Uniforms typically grant buffs to the hero, like extra damage to a class. There is also a SHIELD Lab, which has four possible buildings that can be built: an Antimatter generator, a Warping device. Biometric Converter, and a mini-store. The Antimatter generator generates Antimatter used to build, upgrade, and use the other devices. The Warping device allows players to warp three heroes on missions, and the heroes eventually return with rewards. All heroes used are still playable in missions. The mini-store stocks frequently changing items, such as upgrading items, ISO-8, and sometimes even Biometrics. The Biometric converter converts two already owned biometrics to a biometric of a random hero in a set of heroes that is also frequently rotated.[2]<br/><br/>The game also features a Journey tab, in which players complete certain objectives or missions to gain a reward.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel%3A_Future_Fight Marvel: Future Fight]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "204661": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Constantine Kevorque"], "poll": [], "name": "Tube Heroes Racers", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Take That"], "yearpublished": "2017", "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3111063_t.jpg", "average": "7.25", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Vesuvius Media"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3111063.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Racing", "Video Game Theme"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "You've seen them all over YouTube, now they're racing on your table top!<br/><br/>Tube Heroes Racers, the mobile racing game app, has been transformed into a fast-paced card game!

Your reputation is gauged by school hierarchy. You go up ranks in the hierarchy if you accomplish something with your classmates, and go down if you blow off something.<br/><br/>Players have the same deck of cards, each of which is numbered 0 to 2 indicating how much energy they will commit to an activity. Each round, an event card is drawn. Players secretly determine how much energy they commit on that event, placing cards face-down. Then all cards are revealed simultaneously.<br/><br/>If the event is co-operative, players need to commit a certain number of total energy to accomplish. If successful, all involved players go up ranks. If the event is competitive, only players who have committed the highest energy are successful and go up ranks.<br/><br/>But you should not over-commit an event because the victory goes to the player with the most energy saved in their hand. Because of that, you may play a &quot;Blow off&quot; card secretly instead of committing energy. It saves you from wasting your cards, and you may draw two cards instead of regular one card at end of the round. But if two or more players play &quot;Blow off&quot;, their ranks go down.<br/><br/>After the round, cards played are discarded, except for &quot;Blow off&quot; cards which return to players' hand. When you go up to a certain rank, you may have a friend who can use a special ability for you.<br/><br/>The game ends after several rounds, and you win the game if you save the most energy in your hand, but you can't claim the victory if you are at the lowest rank in the school hierarchy.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>\u300c\u30aa\u30ec\u306f\u5b66\u6821\u3092\u30b5\u30dc\u308b\uff01\u8ab0\u3088\u308a\u3082\u4e0a\u624b\u304f\uff01\uff01\u300d<br/>\u5b66\u6821\u3067\u8d77\u3053\u308b\u69d8\u3005\u306a\u3081\u3093\u3069\u304f\u3055\u3044\u9752\u6625\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u3084\u308a\u904e\u3054\u3057\u3001<br/>\u5468\u308a\u306b\u5acc\u308f\u308c\u306c\u307e\u307e\u3001\u697d\u3057\u3066\u751f\u304d\u629c\u304f\u3053\u3068\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3002<br/>\u4eba\u9593\u95a2\u4fc2\u308f\u305a\u3089\u308f\u3057\u3044\uff01\u3081\u3093\u3069\u304f\u3055\u3044\u4e8b\u3084\u308a\u305f\u304f\u306a\u3044\uff01<br/>\u5468\u308a\u3092\u6b3a\u304d\u3001\u88cf\u3067\u306f\u624b\u3092\u629c\u304d\u3001\u672c\u80fd\u306e\u307e\u307e\u751f\u304d\u308b\u4e8b\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059\uff01<br/>\u5b66\u6821\u884c\u4e8b\u306b\u53c2\u52a0\u3057\u3066\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30eb\u30ab\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u4e0a\u3052\u3001<br/>\u3053\u3053\u305e\u3068\u3044\u3046\u6642\u306b\u30b5\u30dc\u3063\u3066\u4f53\u529b\u3092\u8caf\u3081\u3053\u3080\uff01<br/>\u6f2b\u753b\u300e\u307e\u3058\u3081\u7cfb\u30af\u30ba\u306e\u65e5\u5e38\u300f\u516c\u5f0f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0<br/><br/>"}, "204669": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "rpgseries": ["Solitaire RPG Challenge"], "name": "Emotional Rollercoaster", "rpgdesigner": ["Joseph Gamblin"], "rpgproducer": ["Joseph Gamblin"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3106884.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Emotional Rollercoaster"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)", "Solitaire Adventure"], "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3106884_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>To create a character, grab a blank piece of paper and write the Genre, Tone, and Situation on the top of the page.

Advisors use up the easy, sensible solutions and force Kim Jong-un into ridiculous extremes of problem solving, and while making themselves as troublesome as possible they must be acting as helpful and servile as possible, pleasing the Leader while frustrating him.<br/><br/>Each round begins with the draw of a Policy Card that one player reads aloud. The Policy Card describes a threat to North Korea which upon which Kim Jong-un must render a decision. After each advisor has suggested their own unique solution to the issue at hand, Kim must come up with his own completely novel answer to prove he's smarter than everyone in the room and always knows best. And this, of course, is the correct answer.<br/><br/>The advisors clap with delight over this display of wisdom, whether they like it or not, and then take turns extrapolating Kim&rsquo;s solution to make it grander and grander. Kim then insults each offering for suggesting that it improves on his wisest of decisions.<br/><br/>Throughout the round Kim continually issues demerits to punish advisors for infractions real and imagined. Demerits have no hard mechanical function in the game but enable Kim Jong-un to harass the other players and create more fun.<br/><br/>At the end of a round, Kim Jong-un awards the Policy Card to whomever pleased him the most for whatever reason. That player becomes the new Kim Jong-un and a new round begins. At the end of the game players read grim factoids off the backs of the Policy Cards they've won, letting them know about the horrors in the real Hermit Kingdom.

They praise their king Balor, who reigns from his fortifications in the north with an iron fist. Old paths and ruins spread over the island's face, which will be called Ireland many generations from now. But new tribes arrive at the island striving for permanent presence. Who will control &Eacute;rin's fate over the next centuries to come?<br/><br/>Each player in The Arrival represents a tribe leader who tries to gain predominance over the mythical island of &Eacute;rin while pushing back the demon-like Fomori. But the players are facing a dilemma, for spreading too quickly means becoming more and more corrupt and strengthening the Fomori in their power...<br/><br/>Over 4-6 rounds, the players determine their resources by means of a unique game mechanism, which will be used later on profitably. During a first phase (Earning Phase), players draw four cards, each showing three sections of different resources. Two of these sections are gradually blocked by the player, thus leaving one section. The resources shown on this section are the ones the player gets. During this phase, they have to decide which section is the best one; while the upper section of the cards offers many resources, it also results in unwanted Corruption Points. The middle and the lower sections offer fewer resources, but also less Corruption.<br/><br/>After that, the Action Phase takes place and the players must use their resources wisely while having the choice from different kinds of actions in order to get Fame Points.<br/><br/>The game ends when a certain number of rounds have been played or somebody reaches the corruption limit.<br/><br/>The winner is either the one with the highest amount of Fame Points or the one with the fewest Corruption Points. This depends on the scene of the board at the end: Do the tribes (players) control more locations on &Eacute;rin than the Fomori do &mdash; or is it the other way around?<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English-only edition", "English/German edition"], "average": "7.04565", "name": "The Arrival", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Area Control / Area Influence", "Hand Management", "Point to Point Movement", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "184", "boardgameaccessory": ["The Arrival: Fate Stones"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Ireland"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 030b \u2013 Essen 2016", "Ep 042 \u2013 Essen Spiel 2016 Preview", "Episode 87- Haspelknecht", "Heavy Cardboard Episode 59 \u2013 December (2016) Briefing", "The Game Pit: Episode 70 - Spiel 2016 Treasure Hunt Part 1"]}, "204677": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Hero of Silvergate"], "poll": [], "name": "Hero of Silvergate", "rpgdesigner": ["Rich DiTullio"], "rpgproducer": ["Rich DiTullio"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3106879.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)", "Solitaire Adventure"], "rpgseries": ["Solitaire RPG Challenge"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3106879_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>Hero of Silvergate is a text game where you take on the role of a knight who lives in a fantasy version of medievalesque Europe.

An Alternative History Wargame of a Second Winter War is a low-to-intermediate complexity two-player alternative history wargame that&rsquo;s also easily adaptable to solitaire play. It allows you to investigate the parameters inherent in the situation in Central Eastern Europe, at the end of 1940, had the Bulgarians decided to ally with the Soviets instead of the Germans, which historically they considered doing. Long story short (see the support article elsewhere in this issue), the result would&rsquo;ve been the Second War&rsquo;s eastern front erupting half a year prior to its historic start date under both natural and manmade conditions vastly different than pertained at that later date.<br/><br/>Each hexagon on the map represents 45 miles (73 km) from side to opposite side. Each turn represents a half a month of &lsquo;real time.&rsquo; Each unit of maneuver represents an army or corps or ad hoc equivalent of those sizes of units.<br/><br/>The Soviet (a.k.a. &ldquo;Soviet/Allied&rdquo; or &ldquo;Allied&rdquo;) player commands all the Soviet units in the game along with those of Bulgaria, Greece and Britain. The German (a.k.a. &ldquo;German/Axis&rdquo; or &ldquo;Axis&rdquo;) player commands all the German units in the game, along with those of Turkey, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Italy. Yugoslavia starts the game neutral and out of play. Its government is leaning pro-Allied, however, and it will likely join the war on that side during the course of the game. When/if that occurs, the two Yugoslav-Croatian (4th and 7th) armies will either disintegrate, their soldiers dispersing to their homes, or join the Axis while the rest of the Yugoslav armed forces fight in the Allied side.<br/><br/>The orders of battle contain pretty all the units present in these armies at this time within this theater of operations. The Germans are only missing the non-mechanized corps they had garrisoning their western conquests. The Turks are minus the three corps they kept in their Caucasus and Syrian border areas. Similarly, the Soviets have everything they had available historically in the regions of the USSR lying west of the Urals, north of the Caucasus and south of the Arctic. Their reinforcements are based on what they put together during the first three months of the historic war in the east. Their Independent Coastal Army wasn&rsquo;t organized historically until soon after the start of Operation Barbarossa; however &ndash; given the geo-strategic circumstances of this might-have-been war and the fact the resources needed to organize it already existed at this time &ndash; it was only reasonable to include the ICA as a starting Soviet unit.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "0", "name": "1941: What If?

Do so and you may just be named the new Island Protector...<br/><br/>In Isle of Monsters, a set collection, resource-gathering family game, 2-5 players take the role of monster wranglers attempting to gather the scariest team of monsters they can find in order to compete in the local Scare Faire. Getting screams from the audience gets you acclaim, as does scaring the monsters owned by other players.<br/><br/>Each round, players claim monsters and attempt to feed them their favorite foods to get the beasts ready for the Scare Faire. Each monster that's fully fed by the end of a round goes into that player's hand and participates in the Scare Faire.<br/><br/>Once every player is finished claiming and feeding monsters, a Scare Faire is held. Each player chooses a single color of monster to play from their hand along with as many cards of that color as they wish.
