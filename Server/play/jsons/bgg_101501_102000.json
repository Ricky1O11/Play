The murder and smoking scenes resulted in a CERO (ages 15+) rating for the GBA release, making it the first Nintendo title to receive a parental advisory rating.<br/><br/>The objective is to solve two cases; the murder of a schoolgirl investigating her school's ghost story, and an older murder nearing legal expiration. Like the previous game in the series, the game progresses as the player chooses from a set of commands displayed on a menu. These commands are used to interact with other characters and the game's environment, examine clues, or review facts. The results of choosing each command are displayed in the text.<br/><br/>The SFC remake had improved graphics - directed by Tomoyoshi Yamane, object and Samus designer for Super Metroid and designer for Wario Land 4 and Metroid II: Return of Samus; the remake's music was yet again composed by Kenji Yamamoto. Since the SFC version is on a cartridge instead of a Disk Card, it avoids the load times when saving games and switching between scenes. The SFC version utilized the SFC's 8-channel Sony SPC700, which had more channels than the Famicom's 5-channel Ricoh 2A03 and the FDS's channel together. The SFC version generally had extended remixes all of the original version's songs, and a few extra songs. The game uses either waveforms or white noise to &quot;voice&quot; the characters. The FDS version's voice waveforms are all the same frequency square waves, but in the SFC version, each character is designated to one of a number of different voice waveforms. In the original FDS version, for the protagonist's search for Ayumi, the game required the player to manually go through the town as a pseudo-3D maze; the SFC version had this trimmed down to just text and visual descriptions.<br/>The SFC version adds a &quot;memo&quot; interface that the player can access throughout most of the game. It can be used to look up information on most of the characters (except the protagonist himself, Utsugi, Maruyama, Fumi Tazaki, and all unnamed characters). At some points, the memo's interface is used to fill in question blanks with the names of the correct characters. The memo is also utilized during most &quot;Review&quot; sessions, where the protagonist reviews on what new information he discovered so far. This version also has a &quot;logbook&quot; feature, which summarizes all story and information gathered so far in a save file.<br/><br/>The SFC remake adds an extra, final part to the ending - a personality assessment for the entertainment of the player, based on the player's actions and patterns. For example, analyzing or touching Yoko's skirt could have the game assume a flirtatious personality. In addition, based on how the character treats Ayumi, the game will determine the protagonist's &quot;compatibility&quot; with Ayumi, out of 20 hearts. Actions with Ayumi and other schoolgirl characters would be used to select who to match with the protagonist - this includes the art club member,[64] a flirtatious schoolgirl, and Ayumi herself.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Famicom Detective Club Part II: Ushiro ni Tatsu Sh\u014djo&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "101513": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1224095.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Robert Dougherty", "John Fiorillo", "Justin Gary", "Brian M.

Your corded muscles tighten from the exertion and for a second you free your arms and smash your fist into the jaw of one of the treacherous scum. It is to no avail however; as two more take his place and grip your arm even tighter. Confidently, they press it against the wood and hold it steady.<br/><br/>'Nail him!' snarls Saul triumphantly. One man is holding a long iron nail and a hammer. You renew your struggle, but your arm is held in a vice-like grip. The nail is placed on your wrist and the hammer is brought down on its head. Your whole body is wracked with pain as the hammer nails your bloody wrist into the wood of the cross. You cry out in agony and can barely put up any resistance at all as the vile conspirators do the same to your left arm. Finally, they turn their attention to your legs. You lash out and succeed in winding one of them in the stomach with your brutish kick.<br/><br/>'Defiant to the end', says Saul with a bitter smile. 'I would have expected nothing less.'<br/><br/>It does not take them long to hold your legs steady and yet another nail is driven through both your feet into the cross. You tilt your head back and give a scream of impotent rage. Without a word, the traitors attach ropes to the ends of the cross and haul it upright. You stare down at Saul and his followers. Your former lieutenant looks up at you with glee.<br/><br/>'So now we see who is the true master', he mocks, his yellow eyes bright with delight and his long grey hair flapping in the night time breeze. 'Your army will abandon you and follow me. I will achieve greatness and be remembered for centuries while you will die and be forgotten. Farewell!'<br/><br/>With this he bows, then he and his co-conspirators mount their steeds and take off into the night. You gaze desperately at the bleak landscape of gently rolling hills surrounding you. No one will come for you out here. You hang your head in dejection recalling how you came to be left crucified by your own soldiers.<br/><br/>A barbarian from north-eastern Allansia, you always had a feeling of wanderlust unusual to your simple people. You had travelled the world seeking your fortune and have seen many sights that your own folk would have doubted existed: the majesty of Salamonis; the villainy and danger of crowded Port Blacksand; the decadent civilizations of the Old World and the towering peaks of Kazan. Your strength and natural charisma soon brought you a crowd of followers who you led to victory against the caravans of fat and greedy merchants. One of your followers, the mysterious Saul, rose quickly to your attention, but you were never particularly fond of him. A natural fighter, who threw himself into combat with the ferocity of a wild animal, you realized his potential and made him your lieutenant. You and he grew bolder in your raids and soon you had a sizeable army of followers. You had your army camped outside the village of Fenmarge on the southern edge of Scorpion Swamp; a place so foul that only the most foolhardy dare tread. It was there that Saul made his move. Pretending that there were some potential new recruits waiting, he and his co-conspirators led you to this place at the edge of the swamp. Before you knew what was happening they were upon you, desperately trying to fix you to the cross that they had left there in preparation.<br/><br/>You raise your head, your lungs straining in the effort to breathe. The moon casts its pale light on your face and with a growl you yell a promise: you will free yourself somehow and will not rest until Saul has died by your hand! Once you have made this terrible vow, you turn your gaze downward and are startled to find you are no longer alone. Standing at the foot of the cross is a powerful looking man with a thick brown beard and dressed in furs. A silver medallion hangs from his neck.

Purveyor of Fine Elixirs and Potions. So says the sign above the door of your shop. Normally your customers come looking for remedies for some ailment or other. But lately it's not remedies they want; it's perfumes and hair-dyes. You've been hard-pressed to keep up with the demand. And all because of this high society wedding. Everyone wants to look and smell their best when they turn out on the streets to see Lord Erulph Rudley-Coxcomb marry his young bride Eliana at noon tomorrow.<br/><br/>Here's a customer right now: a young woman sniffing around amongst the bottles of scent. &quot;You after something for the wedding too, like everybody else?&quot; you ask her.<br/><br/>She looks cross. &quot;I'm not like everybody else. I'm one of Eliana's chambermaids. I need something special for the occasion.&quot; She lowers her voice. &quot;Although I must say I'd be happier if she were marrying Sir Lannis. I liked him better.&quot;<br/><br/>You agree. Young Sir Lannis courted Eliana for many months, and they looked the perfect couple, until she suddenly jilted him in favour of Lord Erulph. Lannis was by far the nicer man, in your opinion. Honourable but modest, quite unlike rich and arrogant old Lord Erulph.<br/><br/>The woman opens one of the bottles and wafts it under her nose. &quot;This one's nice. In fact, I've smelled it before. What is it?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It's sweet musk-rose,&quot; you tell her. &quot;I use it purely for its scent. But less reputable herbalists have been known to put it to a more devious use.&quot; The maid looks intrigued, so you continue. &quot;Love potions. That's what they use it for. It can be made into a potion that causes the person drinking it to fall completely and utterly in love with the next person they see.&quot;<br/><br/>A look of horror crosses the woman's face. &quot;Love potions? By all the Gods... I must tell Sir Lannis at once!&quot;<br/><br/>She races out of the shop, and some time later she returns accompanied by Sir Lannis himself. The tall knight marches straight up to you. &quot;Is this maid's word true? The scent she smelled here can be used to blend a love potion?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Indeed,&quot; you reply. &quot;But why?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Because she has smelled it before. When Eliana first met Lord Erulph.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It's true,&quot; says the maid. &quot;Erulph and Eliana took tea together once, and when I was clearing away their cups afterwards, I smelled this scent.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And it was shortly after that,&quot; Lannis continues, &quot;that she suddenly left me to take up with Erulph. It all makes sense, don't you see? Erulph must have administered the potion to her, and made her fall in love with him!&quot; He grasps your arm. &quot;Now tell me, herbalist, is there an antidote? A remedy for this potion?&quot;<br/><br/>You nod. &quot;The blacktooth root. The smoke of the burning root, if inhaled, will negate the enchantment.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Then sell me some of this blacktooth root, at once!&quot; says Lannis. &quot;Here: I have gold. Name your price.&quot;<br/><br/>But you have no blacktooth root in stock.<br/><br/>&quot;Then where can I get some?&quot; he asks desperately.<br/><br/>&quot;You might find it growing in the Darkwood,&quot; you tell him, &quot;if you know what you're looking for. It has a small purple flower, growing high up on a slender stalk...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Don't waste time telling me,&quot; Lannis interrupts. &quot;Come with me! Travel with me to the Darkwood, and help me find this root. But we must hurry. The Darkwood is two hours' fast ride from here.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I will come with you,&quot; you tell him. &quot;But I have two warnings for you. Firstly, the Darkwood is a place of danger, inhabited by thieves and wild beasts.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I have no fear of thieves or beasts,&quot; says Lannis boldly. &quot;What is your second warning?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That we do not know for sure whether Eliana took a potion. She might simply have fallen in love with Erulph, fair and square, without any enchantment, and if so then no root will snap her out of it.&quot;<br/><br/>Lannis nods. &quot;If she truly loves Erulph from the heart, then I must accept it, and be happy for her. But if he has charmed her by deception, I will not allow it! Come, let us leave at once.&quot;<br/><br/>It will be dark by the time you reach the wood. You explain to Lannis that there is no point entering the Darkwood at night, as you will have no chance of spotting the plant in the darkness. However, there is a lodge just outside the wood where you can spend the night, ready to venture into the wood at first light tomorrow morning.<br/><br/>&quot;But she marries him at noon!&quot; Lannis complains.<br/><br/>&quot;Then we will have to find it quickly,&quot; you reply.<br/><br/>Realising that there is no alternative, Lannis agrees to your plan. He goes to fetch two fast horses. While he is doing so you have just enough time to brew up one potion to take with you on your journey. What will it be?<br/><br/><br/>     All-heal? This healing elixir can be used once (by either you or Lannis) to restore 6 STAMINA points.<br/>     Snake-bite antidote? You have heard that deadly snakes live in the Darkwood.<br/>     Speedwell? This potion gives a burst of speed and energy lasting several hours.<br/><br/><br/>Decide which one you will take and note it down on your Adventure Sheet.<br/><br/>You also take a shovel to dig up the root, and dagger in case you run into trouble. However, you are no warrior, and if there is fighting to be done you might be wise to leave most of it to Sir Lannis, who is proficient with a sword.

Yells Hister Brey, Chief Executioner of the infamous Port Blacksand. The maniac picks up the puffy severed head of his latest victim and tosses it into the hysterical crowd in Executioner's Square. The rabble of bloodthirsty peasants tosses it from one side of the crowd to another before the head lands at your feet. The lifeless eyes of what was Blacksand's foremost dye merchant stare up at you. In response, you roll your own eyes at this macabre New Year's celebration and groan inwardly at the thought of another three days like this one.<br/><br/>A short weasel-like man climbs up on the stage while guards are dragging the podgy body off it and an old washerwoman scrubs the bloodstains off the chopping block. He unravels a piece of parchment, puts a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles on his nose and starts his speech with an air of self-importance.<br/><br/>'That was one Mister Alamos Thor, a wealthy and illustrious dye merchant who always wanted to get ahead...'<br/><br/>'Well he didn't today!' Roars Brey. Boos and hisses assault him from the crowd and in return, he makes a few gestures to them. The beaurocrat looks irritated at this exchange and waits impatiently for the noise to die down.<br/><br/>'...in business.' He eventually finished. He then continued. 'Alamos's time was unfortunately cut short as he did not pay his window tax despite him being helpfully informed of it at the monthly tax collectors' meeting held in the cellar of Lord Azzur's Palace warned quite publicly of the consequences of not paying in the classified list of city deviants, written every month and kept in a secure strongbox in a secret location for safety. For such a grievous crime, our lord in his infinite kindness has decided to share Alamos's wealth with the poor of Blacksand. Those that make the backbone of our fine city.'<br/><br/>You start to push your way through the cheering crowd, having no wish to be part of the events which are about to happen. You only just get to the edge of the square when the guards start throwing gold pieces into the crowd. The peasants and beggars start to stampede and brawl over the paltry sum of money. Screams of pain go up from the crowd, which has become an orgy of flying fists and feet. You turn your back to this melee and start to walk down Square Street, back home.<br/><br/>The streets are full of people, most of them drunk because of the five-day New Year celebrations. It is now Fireday, the 24th day in Locking and so it is the 2nd day of the drunken festival. As the drizzle soaks through your cloak, you step over comatose beggars and peasants in the cobbled street. Eventually you walk down Candle Street. The smell of sewage is stronger here, indicating that you are getting closer. You have spent nine months in Blacksand and even after all of this time, your stomach still turns at the its smell. The hot days are unbearable. Everywhere you go, the smell of raw fish mixed with excrement and rotting flesh conquers your senses as if to remind you of the triumph of stench and corruption over this City.<br/><br/>Yet you gave up the comfortable life of a noble of Salamonis to be here and you still have not regretted it. You still remember the day you told your father that you needed to be a wizard. Not wanted, needed. You explained that your intention to study magic was not a whim, but a compulsion, driving you on. You did not know what, but you knew that eventually, it would lead to ascension. You remember the rage in your father's face. 'You were betraying the family! Your lot was to be a knight! You must lead the troops of Salamonis!' He would wave his sword in your face and threaten to finish you if you mentioned it again. So you did not mention it again. You packed your backpack and left the city. You knew exactly where you needed to go and it was not long before you were bribing a gate guard to let you into Port Blacksand.<br/><br/>You did not go to the Sorcerers' guild and you never have. You laugh at the bizarre building as you walk past it but you do not laugh at its weirdness. You laugh because despite its powerful members, there is still one sorcerer who has no part in it and he is the one you wanted to learn from. As you walk down Candle Street, you reminisce about the first time you did so in order to reach the Singing Bridge. Of all the places in Allansia, this is where your schooling in sorcery would begin. Under a rickety bridge over a dead, stinking river, there lived one of the greatest Wizards of good that Allansia had ever seen - Nicodemus.<br/><br/>You had heard the tales of the mage as a youth. You hard how he slew an evil shaman to prevent the resurrection of three ancient wizards. You learnt how he narrowly escaped the death spell and you learnt that eventually he had become sick of people asking him for help and so he had retired to a place where only the desperate would seek him out.<br/><br/>You were scared when you first approached the hut. You had heard rumours that if he took a dislike to you, you would leave his hut as a small furry animal- if you were lucky. However, it did not dissuade you. You needed to learn his wisdom, so you steeled yourself and knocked on his door.<br/><br/>You remember him flinging to door open, and looking at you with impatience and anger.' Why have you disturbed my afternoon nap?' He demanded. However, when he heard what you had to say, his anger turned into interest. You offered him the medallion of your house.<br/><br/>'Are you really prepared to give it all up for sorcery?' He asked. You said that you were, so the old mage took you in.<br/><br/>Over the past nine months, you have learnt the basics of magic and you are now beginning to learn some more powerful spells. You also have the job of doing Nicodemus's legwork.<br/><br/>You are now at his door again, clutching the vegetables and fish that he wanted. The old mage opens the door. You prepare a meal for the two of you. While you fry the fish in a pan, the mage looks at you thoughtfully.<br/><br/>'You know my apprentice, our lives change over time.' He begins. 'As a young man, I felt I had to complete the journey of a hero. Now I feel my journey is complete, I must point others in the right direction of their own hero's journeys.'<br/><br/>'What has this got to do with me?' You ask.<br/><br/>'Patience my apprentice.' Chides Nicodemus. 'Your time will come. But you must do something important for me tonight. A young man has grown up here in Port Blacksand. One day, he will save Allansia from a great evil, but he doesn't know it himself yet. Do not ask me why he was placed here. The Gods work in mysterious ways. But last night, I had a dream from Hamaskis. In my dream, I was wearing my red robes and hat of ritual and he told me to deliver an Elvish artefact in my possession to this man. I need you to do it.'<br/><br/>Nicodemus pulls out a small intricate box and hands it to you. You pull the lid, but cannot open it.<br/><br/>'Only the one it was intended for can open it. His name is Syleron Maris and he works at the Valentis Bane inn as a barman. He will do something of great import one day and he must have this Elvish made artefact tonight.'<br/><br/>'Of course I will deliver it.' You reply. 'Maybe this is my own hero's journey.'<br/><br/>'Maybe it is.' Replies the old wizard. 'Now off you go.'<br/><br/>'What? I haven't armed myself. I haven't even eaten yet.'<br/><br/>'No time for that!

For Galadain the Evil, King of Fernstrana was preparing to invade. Luckily the king's general Daniel thwarted Galadain and killed the Dark Soldier sent from hell by Zeno ruler of Hades. The King with the marriage of his daughter awarded him. Galadain was nowhere to be found, and a price was put on his head.<br/><br/>Little did people know that Galadain had been to Hades to beg Zeno to open the lost portal to the Other World? Giving in to the request, Zeno opens the sealed portal with the black magic of all the evil gods. Coming from the portal were zombies in the millions. Galadain then found another minor portal and appointed a Zombie King as Guardian of the Portal.<br/><br/>The zombies from the Other World were massed and on the next day that the portal was opened they invaded Agron. As the zombies were invading the local prophet made a prophecy... &quot;Galadain has taken these zombies from the portal that was sealed a century ago. But he has found another one, for there are 2 portals to the Other World. By opening this portal he has doomed this world. Yet there is a chance that this world can survive. But that chance is so small, it is like balancing a pint of water on your sword with no container. But if Nicholas the jester can do that, this world may stand a chance. If the main portal is destroyed first the smaller portal will never be sealed and zombies will rule this world. However if the smaller portal is closed first we may stand a chance against the zombies. The small portal is on the hills of Gold. Keep your swords sharp!&quot; he says. But as he said this a swell of zombies swept over him and killed the old man.<br/><br/>Witnessing this prophecy you swear to avenge the old man and you think of revenge as you parry the blows of the zombies. You see your elven friend Prismlord and run towards him. &quot;My friend, we must flee and obey the old man.&quot; Prismlord tells you. &quot;OK!&quot; you reply.<br/><br/>Both of you slay at least 50 zombies and finally get out of the country.

You look around at your fellow classmates. Brother Vengis is listening intently to the abbot as always. He always was a bit too serious. Brother Mendi is pulling faces to the other members of the class. He is a few years older than you are, but he has been visiting his parent's for the last few years. Both were ill and died shortly before he returned, but he does not seem to be particularly upset about it.

You are hopeful that you can rectify that situation when the time comes. For now though, you turn your attention back to the abbot. Perhaps some of his teachings will come in useful?<br/><br/>Later that night, you are awakened from your dreams of adventuring in far off lands by a primal scream. Casting a nervous glance out your window you see the cause of it. Many dark bat like creatures fly through the air around the Sanctuary, screaming in bloodlust. More screams come, but this time it is not the screams of the fell beasts, but screams of acolytes being attacked! You hear the demons smashing at the sanctuary's main gates and you know their purpose; the demons have come to destroy your order.

It's nothing that you could put a name to, just a growing feeling that all is not as it should be. At first you were the only one to feel it, but more and more people have become jumpy as the day has worn on. By opening time even Wert, your usually unflappable guardian and employer, appears ill at ease.<br/><br/>The atmosphere in 'The Flotsam and Jetsam' is heavy with tension, the customers subdued and edgy. You wipe down the counter, not to clean up puddles of beer, but just for something to do. In some ways it feels like the stillness that precedes a storm, in other ways like something else entirely.<br/><br/>Ellen, the youngest of the barmaids, is bringing a tray of empties back when she stumbles, spilling dregs on a swarthy mariner from the south who's been playing cards with several of his shipmates all evening. At once the man is on his feet, one hand at her throat, the other drawing back into a fist. What little noise the crowd had been making is instantly silenced.<br/><br/>You vault across the counter, but before your feet touch the floor on the other side, the southerner's fist is enclosed by a larger one. You hadn't even noticed that Captain Mack was in tonight, but there he is, towering over the angry sailor.<br/><br/>'That's enough, boy,' warns the Captain. 'Now let the lady go and she can apologise for her accident.'<br/><br/>A couple of the southerner's fellows begin to move their chairs back from the table, only to freeze as you draw your knife and Wert takes down the massive driftwood club that hangs behind the bar.<br/><br/>'No need for things to get out of hand,' Captain Mack says, his knuckles whitening as he tightens his grip on the other man's fist. 'We don't want any rough play in here, especially not at this time.'<br/><br/>Without taking his eyes from the southerner's face he calls, 'Am I right, lads?'<br/><br/>The growl of assent comes from all around. With a grimace, the southerner releases Ellen, who promptly bursts into tears and runs into the rear of the inn.<br/><br/>Captain Mack slackens his grip. 'I think it's about time you and your friends were getting back to your ship, don't you? If you set sail at first light, you should make it to Kalagar before nightfall tomorrow.'<br/><br/>With a muttered curse the southerner pulls his hand out of the Captain's and heads for the door. His companions gather up the cards and money from the table and follow him. One of them pauses to throw you a silver piece and mutter, 'This is for the girl, he should not have done that,' before hurrying after the others.<br/><br/>Gradually the interrupted conversations resume, but the air of unease remains. There is little grumbling when Wert decides to close early.<br/><br/>As the regulars begin to shuffle out onto the streets of Red Crab Bay, Captain Mack comes across to the bar, and you thank him for helping prevent a fight. He shrugs it off, and asks for a room for the next four nights. This surprises you, as he has never stayed in town for so long before. You ask if there is anything wrong with the Griffin, his ship.<br/><br/>'No, she's good. But no wise sailor's going to spend any more time at sea than he needs to for the next few days.'<br/><br/>Curious, you ask why. For a moment you think he will refuse to answer, and then he asks an unexpected question. 'How do you feel?'<br/><br/>You tell him of the unease you have felt all day. He comments, as much to himself as to you, that you must have seafarer's blood. Reluctant to dredge up painful memories, you merely tell him that your father had his own ship, and you have a boat.<br/><br/>'But you don't know what tonight is? He hasn't told you?'<br/><br/>You shake your head and quietly explain that your father died many years ago.<br/><br/>'That would explain it.' The Captain takes a deep breath, then continues, 'From now until Lifeday, anyone at sea after dark risks catching the Sanguine Wave.'<br/><br/>His words mean nothing to you, and your expression clearly shows as much. Captain Mack sighs and begins to explain.<br/><br/>'Around a hundred years ago a man was washed ashore, about forty, fifty miles down the coast. Out of his wits, he was, and told tales so wild that none would believe him at first.<br/><br/>'He said he'd been First Mate on a ship out of Ashkyos, bound for Targ&ucirc;l Island. There'd been a fight between him and the Captain, and some of the crew were ripe for mutiny. Then, one night, as they were scheming below decks, there came a terrible cry from above, so they hurried up on deck. And there, by Lunaras' light, they saw that a vast patch of the sea ahead was as red as blood. The helmsman was trying to turn aside and steer away from it, but he hadn't spotted it soon enough, and they caught the edge of the red water.<br/><br/>'At once the sky changed and a chill mist came up, and the sea turned to blood on every side. And it really was blood, they could tell, now that it was all around them.<br/><br/>'Some hoped that if they could just turn the ship around and go back the way they'd come, they might find themselves back on the Silver Sea, but they never got the chance to find out, for out of the mist came another ship. More wreck than ship it was, and must've been kept afloat by some dark sorcery. Black as night, rotting timbers and tattered sails alike, and not a man alive aboard it. But it had a crew, oh yes. Zombies and worse, dragging themselves to the broken rails, rusting daggers and cutlasses in their decaying hands, getting ready to attack once their ship was close enough.<br/><br/>'The Captain and First Mate, and those of the crew as wasn't driven mad by these horrors or too afraid to fight, put up the best defence they could, but for every undead raider they beat off another two crawled aboard. The First Mate got knocked overboard in the struggle, and lost the ships in the mist. Next thing he knew, he was back in the Silver Sea, and managed to keep himself afloat until he reached dry land.<br/><br/>'Everyone thought he was lying or crazed, or both, until wreckage from his ship was washed ashore, some so steeped in blood that days in the water hadn't leached it all away; and one corpse, with the skeletal hand of his killer still gripping his throat.<br/><br/>'The tale soon spread, and for a while any ship that went missing was thought to have suffered the same fate. There was no more blood-drenched wreckage, though, and when castaways were found they had other explanations for what had happened. Before long the First Mate's story was just another legend for old salts to tell on misty nights.<br/><br/>'Then, around twenty-five years later, a slaver ship out of Kalagar came across the bloody sea and was attacked by the black ship. The slaves were brought up on deck to help fight off the undead enemy, and a few of them fought their way to a lifeboat and escaped to tell of what had happened.<br/><br/>'They had something new to tell about the Zombies, too. See, one of the survivors had been grabbed off the streets to make up the numbers just before the ship set sail, and he'd put up a fight and killed one of the gang before the others took him down. The man he'd killed was one of the crew on that black ship.<br/><br/>'So people got to thinking that maybe the blood sea was in Hell, and the ship was where evil sailors go when they die. Some minstrel composed a song about it, and that's where the sea of blood got the name it's had ever since, from the last lines:<br/><br/>         'For the black-hearted man in the watery grave <br/>         Shall rise up to sail on the Sanguine Wave.' <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>'The minstrel called the ship of dead sailors the Black Hulk, and that name stuck as well. For a few months you could hear the song in every port. Then there was another quiet period, and most folks lost interest in the Sanguine Wave and the Black Hulk again.<br/><br/>'It was about nineteen years later that a Sorcerer found out about an extra-planar conjunction that happens once every twenty-five years or thereabouts, lasting for four nights. It was next due in just over six years' time. Someone else figured out that both of the ships that'd hit the Sanguine Wave had done so during the conjunction, and got to suspecting that it wasn't just coincidence.<br/><br/>'When the conjunction came around, those as believed there might be some truth to that idea wouldn't set sail. A few of the ships that were at sea during those evil nights were never seen again.<br/><br/>'Last time the conjunction came, there were more survivors from a ship that caught the Sanguine Wave and was attacked by the Black Hulk, and they named a few of the dead they'd seen aboard it. All wicked murderers who'd been scourges of the seas until their deaths.<br/><br/>'Now the conjunction's come round again, and I'm staying on land until it's passed. Don't want to risk running into the likes of Rangor Tridenthand or Shamit Nestafa...'<br/><br/>You give a start at the mention of Tridenthand, but Captain Mack misinterprets your response.<br/><br/>'No need to fear, my young friend. There's never been any sign that the Black Hulk could come through to Titan during the conjunction. There won't be any dead pirates coming here. Only those as are foolish enough to be at sea by night have anything to worry about.'<br/><br/>It is understandable that Captain Mack should make this mistake. Though he has been to 'The Flotsam and Jetsam' many times, he has never heard your life story, and has no idea what Rangor Tridenthand means to you.<br/><br/>More than thirteen years have passed since Tridenthand killed your parents, knifing your father in the back and stabbing your mother with the three-pronged spike he had in place of his left hand. When you learned what had happened you vowed to avenge their murders as soon as you were sufficiently old and capable. However, six years ago the peoples of Shantak Bay executed him for his crimes, denying you the opportunity to take the revenge of which you had dreamed. Unless there is some truth to the Captain's tale...<br/><br/>If the Sanguine Wave really exists, you could take out your boat, the Barnacle, and go looking for it. The Black Hulk sounds just the place where Tridenthand would have wound up, and boarding it would give you a chance to kill him yourself and finally put out the flame of hatred that has smouldered in your heart all these years.<br/><br/>But dare you sail into Hell itself for vengeance' sake?<br/><br/>"}, "101622": {"rpgdesigner": ["Oswin ten Brinke", "Albert Broers", "Han Heidema", "Ren\u00e9 Raap", "Ton Segers", "Peter Stallenberg", "Maurice Strubel", "Frank ten Hoonte", "Frank van den Bergh", "Ruud van der Graaff", "Hennie van der Salm", "Hans van Halteren", "Marcel van Ravensberg", "Det Wilmink"], "statistics": [], "name": "Spel!

A game of Bushido is fast-moving, flexible and filled with strategizing, counter-strategizing and counter-counter-strategizing. Your tactical acumen is important, but as dice add an element of randomness, so too is your ability to think on your feet.

This game, part of the Musket and Pike Battle Series, simulates six battles of the early Thirty Years War. In the period covered, the armies deployed in more compact formations so each battle fits on half of a standard map.<br/><br/>The battles covered in this game are:<br/><br/>White Mountain<br/>November, 1620<br/>The combined army of the Holy Roman Empire and the Catholic League under Johann Tserclaes, the Count of Tilly, strike a blow directly at the Bohemian capital of Prague. The Bohemians make a stand on the slopes of White Mountain outside the town. Their Transylvanian allies desert them at the most critical point of the battle, causing the total collapse of the Bohemian army and its cause.<br/><br/>This is a short scenario where the qualitatively superior Catholic forces must crush the strongly positioned Bohemians who are bolstered by a large Transylvanian contingent of questionable reliability.<br/><br/>Wimpfen<br/>May, 1622<br/>Tilly joins forces with the Spanish under Cordoba. Together they pursue the smaller army of the Markgraf of Baden-Durlach. They catch his army near the town of Wimpfen, where it is drawn up in a defensive position in a river bend. The Badian camp is fortified in a special traditional way with Spie&szlig;wagen (&quot;pikewagons&quot;), mobile barricades equipped with sharp poles and small mortars. Only when a powder wagon detonates in the midst of the Protestant position, scattering the defenders, the Catholics are able to storm the wagonburg and heavy fighting breaks out.<br/><br/>A balanced pitched battle. A larger Catholic army tries to defeat a Protestant army that is not only protected by a wagonburg but also possesses a strong cavalry force for counterattacks.<br/><br/>H&ouml;chst<br/>June, 1622<br/>The Bavarians under Tilly catch the forces of the zealous Protestant Duke Christian as they try to cross the river Main. To protect the crossing, Christian makes a stand at a stream. At first Tilly hesitates, but eventually the Bavarians attack and the Protestant army dissolves in a chaotic retreat.<br/><br/>A rearguard situation, where the Protestants must delay the Catholics while simultaneously trying to retreat the majority of their army to safety.<br/><br/>Fleurus<br/>August, 1622<br/>Defeated and demoralized, the combined forces of the condottiere Mansfeld and Duke Christian try to escape the German theater and enter the service of the United Provinces instead. Cordoba's Spanish army blocks them at Fleurus in what is today Belgium. The unpaid and mutinous Protestants attack at dawn in an attempt to break through. In a vicious five-hour fight, the Spanish hold, but enough Protestants break through to force the Spanish to lift an important siege in the Netherlands.<br/><br/>This is a smaller pitched battle where a large but very unreliable Protestant army attempts to overwhelm the smaller but more experienced Spanish army. This battle is suitable as an introduction to the game system.<br/><br/>Stadtlohn<br/>August, 1623<br/>Following the battle of Fleurus, Duke Christian again rebuilds an army with raw recruits to join with Mansfeld in the Netherlands and renew the fight for the Protestant cause. However, he soon finds himself outlawed by the Imperor, unsupported and forced to retreat when Tilly's veteran army bears down on him. The Protestan army, slowed by a massive baggage train attempts a last stand and finds itself caught by Tilly's vanguard when within sight of the Dutch border. True to form, Christian decides to risk his army to save his baggage train, but ends up losing both.<br/><br/>A race-against-the-clock rearguard situation where the focus is on the fate of the Protestant baggage train that is slowly moving towards the map edge.<br/><br/>Lutter am Barenberge<br/>August, 1626<br/>The Danish King Christian IV intervenes in the Thirty Years War and pushes Tilly back during the early summer. However, he finds himself outnumbered and on the defensive when Tilly is reinforced by Imperial troops. Christian decides to turn on his pursuers and gives battle in a strong defensive position at Lutter am Barenberge. The initial Catholic attacks are repulsed, but the subsequent uncontrolled Danish counterattack results in the eventual collapse of the Danish army.<br/><br/>This is also a rearguard battle, but with more evenly matched armies, though the Danes are severely hampered by an unusual command situation.<br/><br/>In addition to scenario specific special rules that highlight the unique events of each battle, the battles in the game all share a simple set of special rules. These rules show the peculiarities of the early years of the Thirty Years War, such as Croat/Transylvanian style light cavalry.<br/><br/>Even though not all of the battles included were equal contests in military terms, the player victory conditions are balanced. Along with the special rules, that means the battles are interesting for both sides.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "8.01257", "name": "Saints in Armor", "playingtime": "300", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter", "Simulation"], "age": "14", "usersrated": "171", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Musket & Pike Battle Series"]}, "101683": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1024045.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Robert Hemminger"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2008", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Robert Hemminger"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Avalon Games"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1024045_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Print & Play", "Racing", "Science Fiction"], "description": "Asteroid Racers is a racing game in which players are racing space ships through an asteroid field.

And bold, too. Perhaps the two go together. But from the looks of you, you don't have much to trade.&quot;<br/><br/>You pull the golden amulet from around your neck and hold it up by the chain. It glints in the afternoon sunlight. You tell him you want a sharp sword, chain mail armour, and one of his horses to ride.<br/><br/>When he sees the amulet, his expression darkens. &quot;That's the crest of the fallen king. Where did you find that?&quot;<br/><br/>You've had it all your life, but you don't tell him that. Nor do you tell him that your earliest memory is watching your parents' castle fall to the bat-winged army of an evil Sorceress as you were carried away to safety.<br/><br/>Today is your eighteenth birthday, and you've waited all your life for this day. Your uncle taught you tirelessly how to handle a sword, though he cautioned you against the life of a warrior. Your aunt taught you to ride a horse and told you stories of the Sorceress who laid waste to your parents' kingdom, and the enchanted sword that could defeat her, if anyone was brave enough to find it.<br/><br/>All your life, you've planned to run away and take back the kingdom that is rightfully yours. Today is that day.<br/><br/>Grunting at your silence, the trader gives you a sturdy sword and some well-worn armour, along with a potion and provisions. He unhitches a horse and leads it over to you. But what surprises you is that he refuses your amulet as payment.<br/><br/>He places a big hand on your shoulder. &quot;Where you're going, little one, you'll need that.&quot;<br/><br/>You thank him for his generosity, but he shrugs it off and climbs aboard his wagon once more. &quot;Fare thee well, young warrior. Remember this kindness, and remember the trader who bestowed it on you just in case you do succeed.&quot; He looks down at you for a moment more, and shakes his head. He snaps his reins, and his wagon lurches away down the dusty road.

A long time ago you lived by the sword, earning more than enough gold through your various adventures, enabling you to enjoy a carefree life filled with exotic food and fine wine. Moving from one city to next you made your way around a world filled with dangerous monsters and wonderful magic. Nothing could harm you, a skilled swordsman and experienced trader - this existence was yours to savour.<br/><br/>All that has changed now. A devastating war ravages the land, tearing apart everything and everyone. Your world suddenly lies in ruins and all that you have ever been counts for nothing. You have lived through many dangerous adventures thus far, but nothing has prepared you for this. Where once there was life, there is only fear and death. You now have to escape to survive and kill to live. No one knows how the war started or who is fighting against whom. Some don't care - they just want to kill before they are slaughtered themselves. One thing is clear, war is everywhere and you must leave your home before you are killed.<br/><br/>You are in Port Blacksand, also known as the City of Thieves. This city has seen many strange things in the past years, and was once home to a variety of thugs, pirates and, or course, thieves. Despite the presence of this dangerous collection of misfits, this city has been your home for several years now and you have grown fond of its many eccentricities.<br/><br/>When the war first began to the north of the city, you hastily made arrangements to leave the city, and head to the east. It was your intention to reach the safe haven of Silverton. But your preparations to flee were to slow - the city was quickly surrounded by the invading hordes, and all were trapped inside, the city's guards and enemies alike. Traders and thieves together trapped in hell.<br/><br/>After several weeks of war, you are still trapped in this treacherous nightmare. There is heavy fighting all around you, inside the city and beyond its stonewalls, as the city's guards struggle to defend their stronghold. What was once your home is smashed, and the whole city is on fire. You have been hiding in the cellar of an old stone building in the middle of Port Blacksand for some days now, waiting for the fighting in the city to recede. Now it's time to attempt to leave, as you have almost no food or water left. You have used your last gold pieces to buy yourself a sword from a passing trader fleeing the city. To add to your problems, you have heard the news from some of the city's guards that another large army is approaching the Port Blacksand from the north, presumably to take the city by force. You must attempt to get through the city and leave the City of Thieves using the southern gate.<br/><br/>"}, "101692": {"rpgdesigner": ["Al Sander"], "rpg": ["Fighting Fantasy Gamebooks"], "poll": [], "name": "The Cold Heart of Chaos", "rpgartist": ["Al Sander"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1546845.png", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "rpgsetting": ["Titan"], "average": "8", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Wizard Books"], "rpgcategory": ["Solitaire Adventure"], "rpgseries": ["Fighting Fantasy Amateur Adventures"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1546845_t.png", "description": "From the Background:<br/><br/>You are a young dwarf, one of a large clan that resides in Salamonis. You have had the best of education, and have been told a most secret tale of your ancestors; about the hold they lived in far north of the Icefinger Mountains, and the ritual they performed that blocks the power of chaos from ever entering this world again. Part of this ritual was the carving of the Pillar of Stability, which is located in the abandoned hold of your people.<br/><br/>Knowing this tale, you are certain something has gone wrong. Throughout much of you life you have heard travelers tales of the spreading of chaos, the growing boldness of those that worship the chaos gods, and the increasing effectiveness of their spells. Less than a year ago, Salamonis was threatened itself by a group of chaos cultists hoping to bring pestilence down upon the city itself.<br/><br/>You reason that the Pillar of Stability must be losing power. None of the elders or your tutors want to investigate, indeed they just scoff at your reasoning. So you resolve to make the trek to Grimwoden, the halls of your ancestors, and find out first hand about the pillars.<br/><br/>You are going alone. The only other dwarf that you feel would have aided you is one of your old tutors, Diuron. Sadly he was taken prisoner by a band of goblin mutants many years ago, and is almost certainly dead.<br/><br/>You packed everything that you could afford, given your limited funds, and lack of aid by your people. Then you set off north through the dwarven town of Stonebridge, and then the human town of Fang. Although the trip was not without danger, it pales in comparison to the problem you face now. You&rsquo;re well past the Icefinger Mountains, far from any habitation. Poor weather has slowed you considerably and you have only enough food for two more days. You know you are getting close to Grimwoden, but it could take you weeks yet to locate, and your path back to civilisation is even longer still.

It is almost impossible to make an honest living in Port Blacksand, since it seems that everybody from the thieves down to the authorities themselves are corrupt.

On either side of you sit your two colleagues. On your left is Panian Fleetfoot, an elf who, true to his name, could outrun the swiftest stallion, while to your right sits Trokk, a massive troll with skin as hard as diamond and the strength of ten men. There was no seat large enough for him so he squats on the richly carpeted floor. All three of you are looking straight ahead where Baron Sukumvit, ruler of the province of Chiang Mai, is pacing nervously back and forth. You do not yet know why he summoned the three of you and you are beginning to wonder when he will reveal his purpose. Finally, the Baron takes a deep breath, then turns to face you.<br/><br/>'I have been looking for someone who could protect something very valuable of mine for some time now', begins the baron, stroking his chin repeatedly as he speaks, 'and you three are the ones who I hear are the best in the business.' You all breathe a sigh of relief. At least the Baron's motives are not as sinister as you were beginning to suspect. 'You heard right, your lordship', states Panian with a large grin on his face.<br/><br/>You can tell from the Baron's face that he does not altogether approve of the elf's overfamiliar tone, but he lets him continue.<br/><br/>'Me, Trokk and the boss can protect whatever you want.'<br/><br/>The Baron nods sombrely and speaks once more: 'I don't know if the three of you are aware of this, but I have recently been trying to start a new museum in Fang. The Deathtrap Dungeon brings in many people to the city, but when it is over, there is little to keep them here. So I have decided to open the Sukumvit Museum of the Weird, Wonderful and Splendid. Hopefully it will attract more people to this fair city and if all goes as planned they will be a bit more upmarket than the usual hoi polloi who come here for the Trial of Champions. Now, I have been acquiring various artefacts to display in the museum. I have made a huge investment in it and have already had to sell of my recently deceased brother's estates to finance it. But there is one item in particular I want protected - the Carensen Emerald.'<br/><br/>Trokk lets out a gasp at the mention of this fabled jewel. It is said to be unmatched by any other jewellery in the world.<br/><br/>'Just one question', you ask. 'Why can't you use your own guards to protect it?' Panian shoots a glance at you as if to say 'Why are you trying to talk him out of paying us for a simple job?', but he keeps silent. Meanwhile the Baron is shaking his head.<br/><br/>'Unfortunately I don't dare leave it in their hands', he continues. 'Not that I don't trust them, but one thief has made it known to me that she intends to steal the emerald: Shena Nightfinger - the greatest thief Allansia has ever seen.<br/><br/>'Dis mission gonna be tuffer dan we thought, boss', grates Trokk slowly and you are inclined to agree with him. Shena Nightfinger is world renowned for her fantastic heists and it seems that no amount of security can stop her. Still, a job is a job and they have been a bit thin on the ground recently. The three of you look at each other and nod.

There should be plenty of things to see and do in a big city without costing you an arm and a leg (yeah, right!). If you can't find a museum or art gallery, then perhaps you can find some local street performers or a flea market to while away the hours.<br/><br/>With this thought in mind, you're attracted to a large crowd of people on an otherwise vacant lot.

And many men have died trying to find it.&quot; He leans forward and whispers, &quot;I have broken a rule, my son.&quot;<br/>&quot;You?&quot; You ask, grinning to the idea that your chief would betray the rules that he himself had created.<br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; He continues to whisper and sits back into his chair. He is old now, and his bones under all those robes have become brittle. You offer him a pillow, which he accepts. &quot;I<br/>am old. I have not the strength to carry out these tasks anymore. The baron has requested one son per family to do his bidding- and all for this daughter of his. His daughter that<br/>you have not met, a supposed girl that no one has even seen!&quot;&quot;What have you done that is so terrible that we must whisper?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We?&quot; He said. &quot;Not you but I. I am to blame. A leader must never enrol an unwilling patron into the Chain of Warriors, but I did just that. I did just that knowing full well that<br/>you would not reject what I have done for you. People fear the baron. He has not been courteous. He is corrupt. I want him to suffer. I want you to destroy that demon, and refuse the hand of marriage to his daughter. Bring the sword to us instead.&quot;<br/>You realise now why he signed you up. It was not to marry you off, it was for his personal vengeance upon the baron.<br/>&quot;And... should I fail?&quot; &quot;You will not.&quot; He said. You stand up now. &quot;Young man,&quot; The chief says, &quot;I am corrupted myself for doing this to you.&quot; You leave out of the hut and stand outside in the night air. Above all the stars, all the<br/>shards of a God&rsquo;s broken sword, scatter across the black blanket. You understand that if you refuse to do this then the baron will send his men to your village. They will kill you,<br/>your family, and your village. Your life will no longer be in peace. The baron would make sure that they all suffered. To refuse him after setting a deal is to insult him. Your<br/>chief, you understand, has made a pact with the devil and has put your soul on the bidding table to carry the task out.<br/>Your Maya Ling opened her eyes. It was still dark out. She was lying flat on her back in her bed. She stared at a bright yellowish orange light in her chamber. It grew brighter<br/>and brighter as it neared her bed. She could not move. Her arms and legs were paralysed. A neck chain with a ring lifted up off her chest on its own and hovered there, it<br/>was as if something was trying to pull it from her neck but wasn&rsquo;t strong enough to break the links. Heat.<br/>She could feel the warmth from this being. It looked like that of fire, of a phantom, of a person. She could see its eyes- it ghostly face. It breathed on her through wide nostrils, it<br/>eyes fierce like a dragon. Maya Ling closed her eyes and fell back to sleep again. She was powerless to resist this<br/>creature. You recalled that hour when her father grabbed you by the shoulders and shook you. Her mother accused you of kidnapping her and murdering her! You had only arrived at their<br/>hut shortly after receiving the information from the chief that you were forced into the Chain. You only wanted to tell Maya Ling that you would not marry the baron&rsquo;s<br/>daughter- That you loved Maya ling. That you were forced into this- Her father tried to stab you with a dagger, but you grabbed him by the wrist and brought<br/>him to his knees until his fingers let loose the blade.<br/> &quot;I did not kill your daughter.&quot; You tell him, and glare at his wife who is cowering in the doorway.<br/>&quot;She is missing. There was blood&quot; &quot;He sobs and shakes his head. He doesn&rsquo;t even get off his knees. You help him back to his feet. &quot;She was taken right out of her bed&quot; blood<br/>everywhere.&quot; &quot;Who did this?&quot; &quot;I do not know!&quot;<br/>You go and look for yourself. There is blood all over her bed sheets, blood splattered across the walls and ceiling, and smears across the floor where her parents must have<br/>been stepping. Nothing was broken, nothing was stolen, and apparently, there were no sounds of struggle.<br/>&quot;Please,&quot; her father implores you with his eyes watery. &quot;Come with me to the sage. Let us ask of him what has happened.&quot;<br/>&quot;He is an old crone who knows as much as a roach. His predictions are not accurate.&quot; You say.<br/>He shudders angrily at you and leaves you standing there. He and his wife have decided to go to the sage without you.<br/><br/>"}, "101699": {"poll": [], "name": "Gods & Heroes: Rome Rising", "videogamemode": ["Massively Multiplayer"], "videogameversion": ["European CD-ROM edition", "North American CD-ROM edition", "North American Download edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Ancient History", "Mythology"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Heatwave Interactive"], "videogamegenre": ["MMO", "RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Heatwave Interactive"], "description": "Gods &amp; Heroes: Rome Rising is a mature, full-scale, action-adventure, massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that immerses the audience in Roman mythology.

During their last ferocious battle in the Bras Plains, they used enormous forces against each other. The conflict shattered the land and the impact was so huge that it threatened the existence of the entire world. Magicians from the Hidden Kingdom Lorelight decided to intervene and stop the madness of the raging kings. Their wizard leader - Elnan Wise Wand, teleported himself in the center of the battle. And there, all by himself, he cast a spell with an unseen power - it petrified everything in hundreds of miles. He managed to put an end to the battle but he paid for this with his own life as the spell drew all the energy from his body. All of a sudden, the vast battleground became still and silent. The echoes of the war were not to be heard anymore. Only the speechless statues of thousands of warriors remained there. Both the kings of the Humans and the Undead were awed by the power of the spell. The sudden ending of their armies left them flabbergasted. <br/>The loyal followers of the magician Elnan sent them a message to let them know of the great sacrifice of the wizard leader, and that Lorelight would not tolerate any more this war. The Kings had no other choice but to end the war and sign a peace treaty. However, they had to find another outlet for their boundless hate for each other. This is why they decided to declare the BattleSpell tournament - their presumably legal and civilized way to continue fighting in the small barren territories near the Petrified Battlefield. All Heroes across the world are welcome to join the fighting forces of the Kingdoms and show their strength in the tournament!<br/>Let the battle begin now!<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "101721": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2386027.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Bryan Pope", "Benjamin Pope"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Drew Baker", "Tiziano Baracchi", "Claire Beard", "Leonardo Borazio", "Jason Engle", "Mariusz Gandzel", "John Guytan", "Diego Gisbert Llorens", "Raven Mimura", "Jim Pavelec", "Roberto Pitturru", "R.

How would an Illusionist battle a Druid? Or a Warlock fight a Beastmaster? Or a Priestess fare against a Wizard?<br/><br/>Mage Wars &mdash; redubbed Mage Wars Arena in 2015 to distinguish it from Mage Wars Academy &mdash; pits powerful Mages against each other in deadly arena combat. Each Mage uses his own fully-customizable book of spells to achieve total victory over his opponent. Summon mighty creatures to do battle in your name; cast powerful spells to attack your foe and thwart his every plan and strategy; use hidden enchantments to turn the tables and rule the day; adorn yourself with mighty weapons, armor, and arcane artifacts &ndash; all of this and more await you in the arena of Mage Wars!<br/><br/>Mage Wars is a tactical board game, a combination of a card game and miniatures game, combining the best elements from each genre. The game is played on an arena game board divided into square areas called &quot;zones&quot;, which regulate movement and the placement of objects. Each Mage (player) starts in a corner of the arena, opposite his enemy.<br/><br/>Each player holds a spellbook, from which spell cards are pulled out as they are cast during the game. This has the feel of being a real Mage, turning the pages of your tome of magic, as you plan your strategy each turn. A point system allows you to choose spells for your spellbook, with more powerful spells and spells outside your schools of training costing more points. You have full access to cast any spell you want each turn, allowing for an unprecedented level of rich strategy and tactics. Many of these spells &ndash; such as creatures, equipment, and enchantments &ndash; are placed on the board and become objects in the game. Creatures can move around the arena, and attack each other and the enemy Mage. Attacks deal damage, as well as interesting special effects such as Burn, Corrode, Stun, Daze, Push, Cripple, Paralyze, etc. Creatures can be destroyed when they receive too much damage, or can be controlled by powerful curses and enchantments, or contained by walls and other creatures.<br/><br/>Every Mage comes from a different school of magic, each with unique spells and strategies:<br/><br/><br/>    The Beastmaster will try to rush and swarm the enemy with his hordes of animals, buffed by his nature enchantments.<br/>    The Warlock will go right for the throat, armed with his powerful Lash of Hellfire, Helm of Fear, and Demonhide Armor. Along the way to the enemy Mage, he'll use his curses and fire attacks to contain and destroy enemy creatures.<br/>    The Wizard is a trickster, a master of meta-magic: countering, stealing, redirecting, and destroying enemy spells and mana. He's also a master of teleportation and portals/gates.<br/>    The Priestess will defend with knights and angels and powerful healing and protection spells. She'll wear down the enemy, then overwhelm them in the end.<br/><br/><br/>The base game comes with all you need to get started: spellbooks, extra spells to customize with the spellbooks, arena game board, dice, markers, etc.<br/><br/>New Mages will be released every few months to add new spells, powers, and variety to the game.

As with most games in this genre, the base objective of each round is to capture a certain amount of card points (in this case, more than half) in tricks. However, each round of Hungarian Tarokk starts with a peculiar round of auctions and announcements that impart a lot of information about the players' hands, which make it a very skillful, challenging, yet surprisingly accessible game.<br/><br/>It uses a shortened pack of 42 cards: the trump suit consists of 22 cards while the other four suits consist of only five cards each. The size of each player&rsquo;s hand is only nine cards (with a talon of six cards).<br/><br/>Each round starts with a short auction in which players bid for the right to choose a partner that holds a particular high ranking trump card, usually the XX. The bid itself determines the number of cards the winner of the auction may exchange (higher bids mean less cards exchanged) and the base value of  game (to capture more than half of the card points in tricks) in points.<br/><br/>Players have restrictions on how they may bid; in particular, a player may only bid only if he or she holds an honour (the lowest trump, the second-highest trump, or the highest trump). In addition, there are bidding conventions that, unlike Bridge, are part of the rules. These conventions, or &quot;invitation bids,&quot; indicate if a player holds a particular high ranking trump.<br/><br/>After players exchange cards with the talon, there is a round of announcements. Partnerships can pursue additional objectives other than game:<br/><br/>- Winning three-fourths of the card points<br/>- Winning all the tricks<br/>- Winning all three honours<br/>- Winning all four kings<br/>- Winning the last trick with the lowest trump<br/>- XXI-catch: Capturing the opponent's second highest trump with the highest trump<br/><br/>During the round of announcements, a partnership may announce that they will accomplish one or more of these objectives, which doubles their value. A partnership may also challenge or kontra an announcement, which also doubles its value. These objectives are scored independently; a team can fail at accomplishing game but still accomplish (and score for) other objectives. Often, the value of these objectives is greater than game. For example, the base value of game ranges from 1 to 4 points, while the value of XXI-catch is 21 points.<br/><br/>"}, "101724": {"poll": [], "name": "World Snooker Challenge 2007", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["EU PSP edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Sports - Cue Sports"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Blade Software Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["PSP"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SEGA Europe Ltd."], "description": "User Summary: <br/>World Snooker Challenge 2007 is a sports simulator from Sega.

Each turn, by revealing one of each Alternate World, Target and Mission cards, the players get to face one of over 25000 challenges. As a group, they decide who will attempt the mission and pool their relevant stats to form the mission dice pool. Scoring more successes than the target in the contest set by the Mission card will allow the other players to repair the Navigator device.

It was developed by the German company SEK (Spieleentwicklungskombinat), based in Berlin. The game features more than 50 prehistoric animals, especially dinosaurs and Pleistocene mammals. The game uses TAGES, and therefore installs a driver on the system for copy protection.<br/><br/>The game-concept is similar to &quot;Age of Empires&quot;, which is a real-time strategy game. ParaWorld features food, wood, and stone as resources. Food can be picked from bushes, hunted from animals, fished from the sea, or farmed. Stone is located in limited deposits, and wood, cut from trees, is generally scattered throughout a map. Battles can occur on both land and sea.<br/><br/>The story takes place in a parallel dimension, where prehistoric life thrives alongside diverse human civilizations that are technologically not too far. As a result, dinosaurs take the place of traditional wildlife and livestock, though some of the dinosaurs in-game are highly stylized and not necessarily scientifically accurate. Wild-living dinosaurs can be hunted for food, though some are of dangerous and aggressive species and will attack any player unit that wanders too close. Other prehistoric creatures make an appearance as well, for example woolly mammoths are used where other games might feature elephants.<br/><br/>Players advance through epochs in order to unlock new technologies and upgrades.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;ParaWorld&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "101780": {"rpgartist": ["Attila Adorjany", "Rowena Aitken", "Andrew Bates", "Peter Bergting", "Ed Bourelle", "John Bridges", "Mike Chaney", "Chris Curtin", "David Day", "Jim DiBartolo", "Talon Dunning", "Steve Ellis (I)", "Tom Gianni", "Jeff Holt", "Llyn Hunter", "Leif Jones", "Veronica Jones", "Eric Kim", "Brian LeBlanc", "Eric Lofgren", "Chet Masters", "Jeremy McHugh", "Garry McKee", "Cara Mitten", "Jim Nelson", "Ram\u00f3n P\u00e9rez", "Eric Pollack", "Claudio Pozas", "Nate Pride", "Jeff Rebner", "Erik Roman", "Noi Sackda", "Chad Sergesketter", "James Stowe", "Richard Thomas (I)", "Timothy Truman", "UDON", "Eric Vedder", "Tyler Walpole", "Jef Wayne", "Charles Wright (I)", "Jim Zubkavich"], "rpgitemversion": ["Hardcover Version", "PDF Version", "Unlimited Edition"], "poll": [], "name": "The Tome of Horrors Complete (Pathfinder Version)", "rpgdesigner": ["Kevin Baase", "Erica Balsley", "Casey Christofferson", "James Collura", "Scott Greene", "Meghan Greene", "Lance Hawvermale", "Travis Hawvermale", "Ian S.

You must connect points to... gain points !<br/> - The pawns you use are shared between the players and have a double role: they allow the players to make actions and they are the points themselves: positive if you connect them on the board, negative if you keep them in your hand.<br/> - You don't directly place the connecting pieces on the board: they come into play as a consequence of your playing a pawn, whether you place it on, or remove it from, the board.<br/> - Connecting pieces (the discs) aren't fix, they have a certain degree of variability as the result of players' actions: once they are on the board, they remain on their cell, but they change owner, therefore changing the connected pawns.<br/> Thanks to these characteristics, some parts of the board (usually the peripheral ones) are constantly subject to subtle but meaningful changes and the victory is somewhat uncertain till the end.<br/><br/>The strategic aspect of Hexteroyd originates in the different ways in which you can use pawns: if you tend to empty your hand, you will have more territory control but less mobility; if you keep them in hand you risk to lose points in the end if you can't get rid of them.<br/><br/>"}, "101854": {"rpgdesigner": ["Rafa\u0142 Olszak"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Velvet Lounge", "rpgartist": ["Rafa\u0142 Olszak"], "rpgproducer": ["Rafa\u0142 Olszak"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1026257.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "2.5", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Robotica"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Cyberpunk)", "Science Fiction (Hard Sci Fi)", "Science Fiction (Post Apocalypse)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1026257_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>Scenariusz do gry fabularnej ROBOTICA, opowiadaj\u0105cy o paranoicznej Hiperistocie, tajnej plac&oacute;wce korporacji i jej sekretach oraz losach kilku naiwnych postaci, kt&oacute;re wpl\u0105tuj\u0105 si\u0119 w spore k\u0142opoty.

The ship decks themselves essentially consist of rooms, doors, elevators and repair stations. The repair stations repair your active droid and the elevators let you move between floors.<br/><br/>The overall goal of the game is to eliminate all droids on all of the levels of the ship.

After completing one ship you go on to a new one with a different deck layout.<br/><br/>The various droids have different speed, resilience and weapon strength, but the stronger droids also typically have higher circuit integrity making it more difficult to control them for long, thus balancing the use for high lever droids on low level decks.<br/><br/>"}, "101874": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Kai Haferkamp"], "poll": [], "name": "Capt'n Sharky: Messer werfen", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Characters: Capt'n Sharky"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1027075_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Die Spiegelburg"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1027075.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Die Spiegelburg multi-lingual edition"], "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Children's Game", "Pirates"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>The blades will get stuck in the planks of the deck, but the pirates need great skill to throw their knives in an empty space.

This gives all of the maps the realistic feel that your players crave.<br/><br/><br/>Map Descriptions<br/><br/>Modern Floorplans: Strip Mall Building<br/>KLG Limited - This structure was originally designed as a large upscale interior design office. However, the versatility of this floorplan lends itself to a variety of uses. Ideally, this structure would house a small to medium size company in a large strip mall, industrial park/office park, or serve as an independent structure. This building could hold a variety of professional businesses, such as an IT company, financial consulting firm, or law office. This building could also serve as the financial aid or other administrative offices for a college or university.<br/><br/>Modern Floorplans: High-Rise Building<br/>The Lynette Group - The three floorplans of this high-rise office building combine to create a versatile structure. All three of these plans can be used in concert to create a single structure.<br/><br/>     Entry level. This plan offers an entrance level reminiscent of many high-rise structures that dot the skyline of a medium or large city. This floorplan includes a lobby with fountain, security office, and small convenience store (or newsstand) where employees and visitors can purchase snacks and other items to help them get through their busy day. Visitors access other levels of the building by the stairs on the rear wall or by using a bank of 4 elevators. The entrance to this building sports two revolving doors and conventional glass doors on either side of the revolving doors.<br/>     Office Space. This floorplan is a standard office layout with cubicles, private offices and a large conference room. This floorplan can be repeated to create a building with as many levels as you would like, allowing you to create a small office building or a huge skyscraper.<br/>     Arthur&rsquo;s Restaurant. This level is designed as an upscale dining establishment/martini bar. Typically this would be placed on the penthouse level, but could just as easily be placed on a different floor. The restaurant features an open kitchen divided from the bar area by a large plexiglass divider that allows the guests to watch the chefs prepare wonderful dishes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Modern Floorplans: Two-Story Warehouse<br/>Innout Import/Export, Inc. This is a small warehouse easily applicable for any type of business needing a large storage area, such as a moving company or a distribution center. Its two levels contain a ground floor with ample storage space and a second level with offices overlooking the ground floor.<br/><br/>     Ground Level. This 3700+ square foot ground floor serves as the main storage area and has three loading docks at the front of the building. Two staircases provide access to the building&rsquo;s top floor.<br/>     Second Floor. This floor holds the building&rsquo;s administrative offices. Although there are two executive offices on this floor, the smaller room could serve as an office for the manager&rsquo;s secretary. This floor also includes a conference room, break room, and file room.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "101973": {"rpgdesigner": ["Charles White"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "poll": [], "name": "Goin' Out", "rpgartist": ["Krista White"], "rpgproducer": ["Krista White", "Charles White"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Modern"], "rpgpublisher": ["12 to Midnight", "Fabled Environments"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["Modern Floorplans"], "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>If you need a map of a modern structure, you need Modern Floorplans.

It takes a desire for loot, hordes of your minions willing to be led to certain death (err, victory), cunning strategy, and a touch of treachery. The first player whose Dark Force unit enters the keep, by the end of turn eight, is truly the mightiest champion and claims total victory for his army.<br/><br/>The Story So Far - The Invasion Begins!<br/><br/>Castle StormHaven is guarded vigilantly by brave defenders comprised of an alliance between Men, Elves, Halflings, and Dwarves. For over 300 years, these defenders have repelled numerous invasions from the Badlands, home to the subterranean Dark Elf marauders and the mysterious sect of arcane bending wizards, the Arcanists. StormHaven is the first and last line of defense from keeping the fertile farmlands and gold mines of Western Holmenstein from being overrun.<br/><br/>Years ago, a mysterious masked and exceptionally short villain appeared with the goal of uniting the Badlands and ruling over Holmenstein. Dubbed &quot;the Boss&quot; by his cohorts, he promised gold and power to those who would follow him. First the Dark Elves, then the Arcanists joined his Dark Forces. Soon after, the Orc pirate raiders joined the growing army and brought with them their crazed goblin allies and monstrous cousins, the giants. Knowing The Boss' army needed further strength to overwhelm Castle StormHaven's defenses, he revealed the last piece of strategy for domination, the Undead Horde of the BlackSoot Swamps.<br/><br/>Now the four dark force armies &ndash; Dark Elves, Arcanists, Orc and Goblins of the Green Tide, and the innumerable Undead host &ndash; begin their long march east.<br/><br/>Dark Force Army Overview<br/><br/>Choosing your army is part of the fun of Storm the Castle! Each Dark Force army has unique units, power cards, combos and strategies. Is one better than the other - no! It&rsquo;s how you use your strengths while minimizing your weakness. Each army has a fair opportunity to win.<br/><br/>The Green Tide: Orcs, goblins, giants, and other humanoids make up this loose tribal alliance. Specializing in brute force and strange Eastern technology, players who enjoy large explosions, brute strength, and dangerous yet untested weapons will enjoy smashing their way to victory with this army.<br/><br/>Pros: Hard hitting units with lots of equipment upgrades. Power cards primarily focused on attacking and smashing. The rock lobber is one of the most effective siege weapons in the game. Goblin sappas provide for cheap, hard hitting units.<br/>Cons: Moderately expensive units. Lack of diversity in their power cards utility. Equipment can be deadly for both you and foe!<br/><br/>The Arcanists: Mixing metal with magic produces stunning results.

In the game, the player plays a squid named Ikachan, who swims through an underground cave, meeting and helping other creatures.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Ikachan features unique gameplay; as opposed to using the arrow keys to move, the player uses the left and right arrow keys to tilt Ikachan in the respective direction. The player must then use the 'z' key to swim in the direction Ikachan is pointing. Thus, Ikachan cannot swim directly to the left or right at first, but he later acquires an item that allows him to charge horizontally. Also, while being unable to hurt enemies from the start, once Ikachan receives an item called the Dunce Cap, he can attack enemies by ramming them with the point of the hat.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Ikachan&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}}
