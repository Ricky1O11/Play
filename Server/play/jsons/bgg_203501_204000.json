It's a hidden information, bluffing and deduction light family game.<br/><br/>During setup each player receives a hand of 5 cards and 10 coins which are placed in hidden place. Regardless of number of players there are always formed five banks on the table which receives one card each at the start of the game.<br/><br/>On a player's turn the player has to reveal one of the tiles that show which action she will perform. There are four possible actions:<br/>1. Play a card - the player has to play a card from a hand face down to one of the five banks and then draw back to the hand of five cards.<br/>2. Look at one card - The player has to look at one card which lays down at on of the bank while not showing it to other players.<br/>3. Reveal one card - a player has to reveal and leave face up one of the cards laying in one of the banks.<br/>4. Rob the bank - A player has to choose which bank the players will rob.<br/><br/>When robbing the bank each player chooses the amount of her money that she wishes to invest in robbing the bank. Then all amounts are revealed simultaneously. Then all the cards that lay face down in the bank are revealed and show the amount of money that can be robbed. The player who bids the least takes his loot first. She takes the money invested and the same amount from the bank following by other players. If there are insufficient money for one of the players she takes nothing from the bank and so do the players after her.<br/><br/>Apart from money cards there are also special cards which changes the outcome of the robbery:<br/>Guard - Prevent the players from stealing the money. Everyone who invested 0 in this robbery receives 5 regardless of the money in the bank.<br/>Thief - Prevent the players from stealing the money and also steals the money invested in this robbery by all players.<br/>Judge - reverse the order of players taking the money.<br/>Lady - Cancels all other special cards.<br/><br/>When the deck is depleted the play continues until one of the players use all of her cards. After that the players rob all the banks one after another and the game is over.

In short; adventures. The many details of life outside this slice of interest are often ignored as much as possible, being less interesting and important as well as far too prone to the fiddly details which turn D&amp;D into Accountants and Actuaries.<br/><br/>Yet, there are always those players who want downtime. The individuals who want to research a new spell, craft a new weapon, set up an inn, tavern, or other business, or otherwise use their hard-won wealth on something other than the adventuring life. Perhaps leaving a mark in the world. Sometimes these periods happen because the DM says so; perhaps they feel the kingdom and world cannot always be at risk and the party cannot always have an immediate lead on a new source of untold wealth and glory. Sometimes downtime is the result of a real world intermission. The days, weeks, and months where real life overtakes players being reflected in the game itself.<br/><br/>For whatever reason downtime happens, this book exists to make it more interesting. These optional rules and options can make the choice between lifestyles mean something more than how much gold is removed from the characters&rsquo; pockets. It certainly gives characters, even those &ldquo;wild souls&rdquo; who chafe at the idea of inactivity, intriguing choices to make in how they spend their non-adventuring time. For downtime effects, this means adding some risk and reward to the choice of lifestyle. Do you choose the cheaper, but more dangerous route, or the more expensive and safe route? Regardless, life has some inherent risks and on some level all adventurers are looking for their next grand tale.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, downtime actions are about giving characters and players something the character wants that they cannot gain through adventuring alone. Perhaps they simply wish to spend their enforced stillness preparing for their next adventure directly. Alternately, for those who recognize that spellcasters are not the only individuals who need magical items as they progress and question the wisdom of relying on the random detritus lost by their forebears; rules are provided to give the opportunity for noble knights to forge blades of legend. Even the most savage or ignoble members of a party have more intuitive and primal ways to weave of the forces of destiny into enchantments for their equipment.<br/><br/>"}, "203553": {"poll": [], "name": "Neon Space Ultra", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3088397.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Aliens", "Space"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "3", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3088397_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Space Invaders clone with some extra explosions of colour.<br/><br/>"}, "203554": {"rpgartist": ["Gary Dupuis", "Tony Petrecca", "Patrick Pullen", "Heather Shinn", "Emily Vitiori", "Daniel F.

Be it at the brothel or at the market, men such as the Pope or the Emperor can be seen hard at work at any time of the day. Even the most miserable miser, though, would be well advised to also strive to get hold of enough precious stones and wine to make sufficient donations towards the Lord's cathedrals. After all, it is through pious generosity that a poor soul can gain the all-important letters of indulgence and be pardoned for a life of greed and lust. When all is said done, what matters is to have sinned just enough to have achieved all goals and gotten away with it, while others took the fall.<br/><br/>In more detail, to win, players have to end the game with their &quot;poor souls&quot; closer to heaven's gate than their opponents. Alas, throughout the game these poor souls pretty much exclusively move in the opposite direction, i.e., towards Hell. Only at the very end of the game might players climb back towards heaven, depending on the letters of indulgence that they managed to collect up to that point.<br/><br/>The accumulation of these letters of indulgence is each player's primary goal. To this end, they take on the roles of different people: the Pope, the Emperor, the Merchant, or the Little Sinner. Each round, these roles in turn grant them access to different special actions. On their turn, players buy or sell goods on the market, visit the brothel to benefit from personal connections, or secretly donate money and goods to the church. Meanwhile, the construction of the game's three cathedrals proceeds. As soon as a cathedral is fully erected, the church will hand out the all-important letters of indulgence. However, only those who have donated the most in either of three categories will actually receive anything.<br/><br/>Many perks that can be used during the game require the players to &quot;sin&quot;. Sins are tracked by means of a tally stick and will move the player's poor soul closer to hell. The player who strikes the right balance and picks the right roles at the right time will be able to collect the most valuable letters of indulgence and might stand chance at winning the game. If a player has burdened themselves with too much sin, though, all will ultimately be for naught.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition", "English/German first edition"], "name": "Mea Culpa", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Area Control / Area Influence", "Auction/Bidding", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Set Collection", "Variable Player Powers", "Voting"], "average": "6.22589", "usersrated": "168", "age": "14", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["HLG 10: Meer Essen"]}, "203627": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3089436.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Andrew G.

Several of the mechanics were made to support this: the increasing amount of danger points and the speed of which the characters acquired their wealth. Still, there is nothing in the way of using the game for longer campaigns, and the core book even offers some suggestions of what game mechanics that needs to be changed to achieve this.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, a longer campaign dedicated only to looting can become stale and uninteresting, unless something more is offered to give it a sharper, dramatic edge. In this supplement are two extended campaigns to be used for Scavengers. Both of them increase the scope of the game, and make it better suited for longer campaigns.<br/><br/>The first is Magpies of War. Instead of being a regular salvager crew, the player characters are active participants in the galactic civil war. By finding important pieces of secret intelligence on shipwrecks, they can sell them to the warring factions for high profits. But they must beware, if one faction grows to strong, it may defeat the other factions, and put an end to the Randians' lucrative salvaging business.<br/><br/>The second campaign is Boardroom Salvagers. The PCs are not satisfied with getting rich of their salvaging, they want to be super wealthy. With the conclusion of their initial salvaging careers, the original crew forms a salvaging company, and hire employees to continue their work. In this campaign the players string together multiple characters, seeing how each of them fare in their career, how the company prospers throughout, and how powerful the original company founder can get.<br/><br/>Finally, this supplement offers new threats. They are intended to be used mostly with the Magpies of War campaign, since they are tied to the intelligence gathering mechanics of this campaign; but they can easily be used in any Scavengers game.<br/><br/>"}, "203671": {"average": "9.5", "poll": [], "name": "Relicblade: Two-Player Battle Set", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Deck / Pool Building", "Dice Rolling", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3099031_t.png", "boardgameintegration": ["Relicblade: adventure battle game", "Relicblade: adventure battle game"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Metal King Studio"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3099031.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Fantasy", "Medieval", "Miniatures", "Wargame"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>&quot;At the crossroads of salvation and supremacy brave heroes and brutal monsters clash for control of powerful magic relics, lost in the ruins of the ancient world.&quot;<br/><br/>In this fast paced miniatures skirmish game players customize their characters using a vast arsenal of upgrades to gain a tactical edge.

The catch is that all cards are played face down, so any card can be bluffed as any other card, and all plays can be challenged, instantly ending the round. Each round comes with new opportunities to make tricky plays and mind game the other player. Experienced players can also keep track of which cards have been played and bluff strategically to strengthen their attacks.<br/><br/>The basic deck contains 20 cards: 12 attackers, 7 blockers, and a Wolf which can only be played by bluffing. There are also 10 special cards, two of which are randomly added to the basic deck at the beginning of each duel. These special cards all change up the basic game in their own way, either by adding special mechanics, or altering the balance of power. Players discover which special cards are in the deck over the course of the duel, and can use this information to make more believable plays and deduce which of their opponent's plays are likely to be bluffs.<br/><br/>"}, "203713": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Devistofeles"], "poll": [], "name": "Gates: Mana Wars", "playingtime": "140", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Deck / Pool Building", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Player Elimination", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "140", "boardgamecategory": ["Fantasy", "Miniatures", "Print & Play"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Gates is a competitive, turn based board game with strong aspect of deck building and managing unruly creatures.

Each player becomes a master thief about to commit the most daring burglary of his career. During the game players may use unique abilities of their thieves as well as various action cards, which represent maneuvers, alchemical potions or complicated devices inspired by visionary ideas of Renaissance inventors. The players choose cards to play and then use available Action Points to plan the order of their activities. This makes the game very dynamic, with each resolved action dramatically influencing the turn. The players&rsquo; order changes dynamically depending on the number of Action Points placed on each chosen card.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to break into the vault inside the Emperor's palace and steal the Emperors' Jewel, the symbol of power very precious to the ruling dynasty. However, this is hardly the end, because thieves must escape from the city with their loot. This is no easy task - the streets are patrolled by vigilant city guards and veteran captains well versed in all criminal tricks. Additionally, time is running fast for the thieves - event cards introduced each turn control the flow of the game, escalating its pace and difficulty of challenges for the players to overcome.<br/><br/>The thief who will manage to escape through one of four city gates taking with him the Emperors&rsquo; Jewel or other valuable loot will be the winner of the game. Anyone who will stay inside Hadria after resolving the last event card will be caught and mercilessly thrown inside the city dungeon, their names erased from the annals of the omnipotent Guild.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "German first edition", "Polish first edition"], "name": "Age of Thieves", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Action Point Allowance System", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": ["212553", "227798"], "usersrated": "155", "average": "7.20774", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 103 -- Whisky, Pips and Pancakes", "HLG 10: Meer Essen", "The Game Pit: Episode 70 - Spiel 2016 Treasure Hunt Part 1"]}, "203741": {"rpgartist": ["R.

There&rsquo;s nowhere left to run, and all that&rsquo;s left is survival. There is no rescue party waiting, no help from kind strangers...in the world of The Walking Dead, there is no sanctuary&hellip;<br/><br/>The Walking Dead: No Sanctuary is a cooperative board game of desperate survival set in the world of the popular AMC television series. Designed by Adam and Brady Sadler (Warhammer Quest: The Adventure Card Game), No Sanctuary puts players in the roles of iconic survivors from The Walking Dead, working together against desperate odds as they navigate a variety of scenarios. Whether the survivors are scavenging for supplies, fighting off waves of the dead, or even standing toe-to-toe with the living, the group must find a way to work together even when its members&rsquo; interests may be at odds.<br/><br/>No Sanctuary features a unique leadership mechanic in which players take turns assuming the role of the group&rsquo;s leader. Each turn, the leader must choose the group&rsquo;s approach by drawing two event cards and choosing one. Since players cannot discuss this decision, the pressure is on the leader, and the leader alone will pay the price if the group is unable to follow the approach for the turn. Make enough bad decisions, and the leader may have to relinquish his role and let the next survivor take charge of the group.<br/><br/>Each survivor in No Sanctuary comes with a unique deck of cards to represent their special actions and abilities, as well as their flaws. This deck not only drives each survivor&rsquo;s playstyle, but it also serves their health, so hand management is crucial to surviving each scenario. Equally important as staying alive, group morale is an essential part of the game. Many game effects will cause morale to drop, and if it reaches zero, the players lose the game. Maintaining the group&rsquo;s tenuous psychological stability is just as important as staying alive!<br/><br/>With its unique gameplay and innovative leadership mechanic, No Sanctuary offers players a deep and engaging way to experience their favorite episodes of The Walking Dead, and even explore beyond the show&rsquo;s storylines!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "8.05", "name": "The Walking Dead: No Sanctuary", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "15", "boardgameexpansion": ["203949", "203948"], "usersrated": "20", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Movies: The Walking Dead"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["14.

Don&rsquo;t miss out as Volo and Elminster square off (academically speaking of course) to illuminate the uninitiated on creatures both common and obscure. Uncover the machinations of the mysterious Kraken Society, what is the origin of the bizarre froghemoth, or how to avoid participating in the ghastly reproductive cycle of the grotesque vargouille.  Dungeon Masters and players will get some much-needed guidance as you plan your next venture, traipsing about some dusty old ruin in search of treasure, lore, and let&rsquo;s not forget ... dangerous creatures whose horns, claws, fangs, heads, or even hides might comfortably adorn the walls of your trophy room.

Accompanied by only the best adventurers I have entered ruined keeps and the long abandoned towers of famous sorcerers. Here I found the spells of old masters of magic like Dreamweaver and Ingmar.<br/><br/>By far most spells however I have found in safer places. The Master Transmuter of the gnomic University of Magic of Oredig has granted me to search through the tomes he made as a young adult, and the vast library of the elves of Faruel proved a rich source of spells from the famous half-elven transmutress known as the Green Orion.<br/><br/>In this tome I present you not only these ancient spells, but also the much newer findings of that famous gnomic illusionist Onno Trickthought, whom I met at the University of Rockhome.<br/><br/>Apart from these wizard's spells, I have endeavoured to bring together a large amount of priestly prayers. These I found in the annals of the orders of Solonor Thelandria, Corellon Larethian, Dugmaren Brightmantle and Gaia. I hereby thank these priesthoods for their invaluable contributions.<br/><br/>Because of safety precautions, this tome only presents spells from the first to the fifth level. Higher level spells will be included in a future edition of this tome, which will only be accessible by members of the gnomic universities and faithful priests of the above mentioned orders.<br/><br/>Still, be careful in the examination of the spells contained in this book, and refrain from inappropriate use of their powers.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>Includes wizard and cleric spells from 1st through 5th level.

The Micro Game Challenge was judged by board game critic Cyrus Kirby, who is better known as Father Geek, and by the podcast team at All Us Geeks.<br/><br/>Dig Down Dwarf is a fast and casual game that is fun for all ages and all skill levels. Newcomers will be attracted to the easy-to-learn rules and press-your-luck mechanics, while skilled gamers will love the ability to alter dice rolls by spending gems and to activate special dwarven powers.

Players will randomly draw 3 at the beginning of the game and these will become a way to score bonus points at the games end. Players decide, as a group, if the objectives are be kept secret or placed up for all to see.<br/><br/>New Artwork - Second Edition comes with clean new graphic design work and artwork throughout. You will still recognize some of the icons and fonts, but the new design is meant to convey a sense of nostalgia.<br/><br/>More Gems - Second Edition comes with 20% more of the shiny gems that made the First Edition such a smash hit!<br/><br/>Six Player Support - With the addition of extra gems and other components, Dig Down Dwarf Second Edition can host up to six players.<br/><br/>New Dwarf Power Cards - These new cards utilize acrylic cubes to track the dwarven skills you have unlocked during the course of the game, instead of rotating the card like you had to do in the older version.<br/><br/>New Dice Colors - Like the new Dwarf Power Cards, we have listened to the feedback over the course of hundreds of plays since the first Kickstarter over two years ago. One thing I noticed was players not noticing that they triggered a dwarf power, because each dice was a different color and it was too much to keep track of for many. A very simple solution has been implemented. You now roll three black dice and one red die on your turn. The red die activates everyone's dwarven powers.<br/><br/>New Gem Colors - Another complaint we got was that some of the gems looked alike in color. We made sure to make that a non-issue this time around. Star gems are now really yellow and we are now able to manufacture the gems in black for the cursite (fossilized dragon dung) which further helps distinguish each gem type.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition"], "average": "7.22321", "name": "Dig Down Dwarf (Second Edition)", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Chit-Pull System", "Dice Rolling", "Press Your Luck", "Set Collection"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "28", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "203846": {"rpgdesigner": ["Plasto \"The Purple Transmuter\" Quinon"], "rpgitemversion": ["HTML Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Shinshannara", "rpgartist": ["Plasto \"The Purple Transmuter\" Quinon"], "rpgproducer": ["Plasto \"The Purple Transmuter\" Quinon"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3094414.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["AD&D Second Edition (2e) Compatible Products"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3094414_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>Shinshannara is a small, moonless world, close to its weak, light orange sun.

Do you have the stamina, speed and strength to be the victor!<br/><br/>A boxing themed card game for 2 players.<br/><br/>Setup: <br/>Divide the cards into five decks: Fighters, and the four Skills decks - Punch, Dodge, Counter and Cross.<br/><br/>Shuffle the Fighter deck and give each player two Fighter cards. Players choose one card and place it face up and one card on top of it face down. Use the corner of the face down card to mark the starting stamina of 10 on the face up fighter. Note - each fighter has a unique set of skills and a favored hand.<br/><br/>Separately shuffle each of the Skill decks and deal a number of cards to each player as listed under &lsquo;Skills&rsquo; for the Fighter&rsquo;s card setting any extra cards aside.<br/><br/>Then, shuffle all Skill cards previously set aside and deal one to each player. Any remaining cards are removed from the game. <br/>Both players now have a deck of 21 Skill cards. Each player will look at their cards and choose 11 cards to take in hand for the first round. The other 10 cards will be used in the second round and are set aside.<br/><br/>Types of Skill Cards: <br/>Punch cards are attack cards and deal damage, reducing a player&rsquo;s stamina.<br/>Dodge cards are defense cards, reducing stamina damage.<br/>Counter cards are defense cards, reducing stamina damage from the other player and then immediately become attack cards and deal stamina damage to the other player.<br/>Cross cards are attack cards and deal stamina damage, and then give a bonus attack value if the next card played by the player is a Punch card.<br/><br/>Play: <br/>Players will simultaneously choose a card from their hand, placing it face down in front of them. Both players will then reveal their cards at the same time and place them face up in front of them in a row. Players then assess who will take stamina damage based on the two cards just played.<br/><br/>After 10 cards are played in the first round, both players will place their 11th card in front of them and add the number in the upper right of the card to the current stamina on their Fighter card. This is the only time stamina is added to a player&rsquo;s total.<br/><br/>Both players will then take the remaining 10 cards into their hand and fight a second round. If at any point, during any round, a player&rsquo;s stamina is reduced to zero that player is knocked out and the other player wins. The player with the higher stamina after two rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>If, after two rounds, players have the same stamina value, each player will choose 10 cards from their deck of 21 and will compete in a third and final round. If players are still tied after a third round, the match is a draw.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "12", "name": "Boxing Clever", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "average": "7", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Boxing"]}, "203918": {"poll": [], "name": "Don't Drop the Bass", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Comedy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["RadishBox"], "videogamegenre": ["Action"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["RadishBox"], "description": "Keep the bass in the air for as long as possible or compete to become the bass emperor.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "203919": {"poll": [], "name": "Dead Age", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Zombies"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Silent Dreams"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Headup Games"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Survive a zombie outbreak.<br/><br/>"}, "203920": {"poll": [], "name": "Line / Dash", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Abstract"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "description": "Line/Dash is an Arcade-oriented game that doubles as a procedural player-controlled multimedia sculpture.<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "203921": {"poll": [], "name": "FRU", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["XBLA Xbox One Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Puzzle"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["Xbox One"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "description": "RU is a puzzle platformer that features an innovative use of Kinect, in which your silhouette becomes a &quot;portal&quot; between two worlds.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "203922": {"poll": [], "name": "discover.bb", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "average": "1", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Trivia"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This is a game about getting to know the German town B&ouml;blingen developed by a group of pupils at a local school.<br/><br/>The gameplay is inspired by Monopoly.

Light-hearted in tone, it is infused with classical culture. If you have ever seen the movie Brancaleone or read The Name of the Rose, well, you know what Kata Kumbas is about. In 2015 Kata Kumbas was published again in Italy, totally reworked and redesigned, as a Savage Worlds setting.<br/><br/>The main theme of KK is that you play as yourself; connecting Earth and Rarte (the alternative Earth where KK takes place) there are magical Gates, through which people like you and me can pass. Visitors to La&igrave;tia are welcomed by Gate Keepers, who cast upon them the Integration Spell, a special magic which &ldquo;transforms&rdquo; them into La&igrave;tians, granting them the capacity to speak the local tongue, and making them knights, alchemists, rogues and soon, but keeping the memories and the identity of the player.

One day you hear about a mysterious ritual taking place in the underground cellar of the city&rsquo;s prestigious Miskatonic University. You and your team decide to investigate the ritual anonymously trying to get the next exclusive. Without much thoughts you step into the cellar, but it wasn&rsquo;t long before you regretted your decisions. The ritual is a truly horrifying experience worshipping the ancient gods until people went insane!<br/><br/>In the dark and musty cellar, people are passing around artifacts. You can&rsquo;t quite make out what is being passed around, but in the distance you can barely see what others are holding. It looks like some of these magical artifacts are the cause of the people&rsquo;s insanity. You will need to deduce which artifact you are holding by looking at the others.<br/><br/>Try to keep your sanity and escape from the ritual alive!<br/><br/>Game Play Overview<br/><br/>Arkham Ritual is played over a course of several rounds, and each round consists of several turns. At the start of the round, each player will be dealt 1 card face down. You will hold the card so that other players see the face of the card (in other words, you see the back of the card, and you see everyone else's card). You may never look at the face of the card you are holding!<br/><br/>At the start of each turn, the active player draws a card and look at the card. That player then decides who to pass the card to.<br/><br/>The player who receives the card has a choice to either:<br/>a) discard his / her card face up and take the new card without looking at them<br/>b) pass the card to another player<br/><br/>Then the next player takes a turn.<br/><br/>The round continues until one of the round end condition is met. At that time you determine the survier based on the condition that triggered the round end. In general, if you have an unique Sane (Blue) card then you survive the ritual. If you have a Cursed (Red) card or if someone else has the same card as you, then you lose sanity.<br/><br/>After determining survivers and losing sanity, the next round is played until one or more players lost all their sanity.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "6.649", "name": "Arkham Ritual", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": ["Memory", "Press Your Luck", "Trading"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "10", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Cthulhu Mythos", "Headband deduction games"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The Dice Men Cometh \u2013 Episode 152"]}, "203968": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Alex Weldon"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Creatures of Dark Manor", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Memory"], "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3167423_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Terry Michaux", "Alex Weldon"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["MJ Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3167423.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Mulitilingual first edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Memory"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Players take on the role of an adventurer and explore the manor room by room.

As other cards are placed have to touch the edge of another card. Doorways however are placed face up to begin with and where possible should not be placed next to each other.<br/><br/>The last player to add a card picks the doorway they wish to start on and the remaining doors are turned face down.

In addition, this allows player characters (PCs) to encounter one of these groups early in a campaign and then again after both teams have gained experience with minimal extra work for the Game Master!<br/><br/>If the entire team is unsuitable for inclusion in the campaign at the time, then NPC stat blocks can be used individually as needed.  A mixed approach can also be interesting.  By introducing a single foe into the campaign, this product gives a number of friends or allies that foe could call upon after running afoul of the PCs!  This gives the Game Master a ready-made answer to who would the NPC go to for assistance, or even who would come to avenge his death at the hands of the PC party!<br/><br/>Using This Product<br/><br/>This product presents the overall history of the NPC team as well as the backstory for each individual member of the gang.<br/><br/>Each NPC has four stat blocks (CR 4, CR 9, CR 14, and CR 19) demonstrating his progression and growth over time.  As a visual indicator, the color of the name bar designates which stat blocks from each NPC are of equivalent Challenge Rating along with the CR text.<br/><br/>Composition<br/><br/>Each gang is comprised of multiple members which can include a mixture of races, class levels, and templates.  This section helps the Game Master compare different gangs&rsquo; capabilities and make-up at a glance without having to review each stat block.<br/><br/>Team Members<br/><br/>    Doblok Blackscale &ndash; LE male kobold<br/>    Garn Scanlon &ndash; LE male kobold<br/>    Kenina Sera &ndash; NE female gnome<br/>    Mardig Flusterfoot &ndash; LE male halfling<br/>    Yerba Rek &ndash; LE female kobold<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Team Summary<br/><br/>Every one of this vicious team of murderers and assassins is a member of a small race.  Their size and training makes them remarkably skilled at stealth and infiltration.  However, their size puts them at a disadvantage against many foes in a straight battle.  To compensate, this team excels in deception and traps.  They attack from ambush after preparing the battlefield with pits, snares, bombs, and other hazards to sway the tide in their favor.  They utilize ranger trapper abilities alongside sorcerous conjurations and alchemical explosives and poisons to setup these perils.<br/><br/>This team is primarily comprised of kobolds, and they bring their devastating knowledge of traps.  However, to function within civilized lands, they are joined by a pair of assassins:  an enchantment-spinning gnome and a halfling monk.  These two handle the social aspects of their trade while their unseen allies construct trap-riddled escape routes and ambush zones.<br/><br/>"}, "204000": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Alex Hall", "Mat Hart", "Richard Loxam"], "poll": [], "name": "Dark Souls: The Board Game \u2013 Gaming Tiles Expansion", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Modular Board"], "yearpublished": "2017", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "average": "7.76667", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Steamforged Games Ltd."], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Exploration", "Fantasy", "Miniatures", "Video Game Theme"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This expansion features new locations within the universe.
