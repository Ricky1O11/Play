With this new set of wargames rules, players can take on the role of these warlords and command their own armies on the tabletop. Written by the author of the popular Glutter of Ravens rules set, Dux Bellorum is an element-based system, where each base of figures represents 50 fighting men. Each player has a specific number of points with which to construct his force and can choose to a Late Roman, Romano-British, Welsh, Saxon, Pictish, Irish, or Sea Raider army. The game is then played out following a set of simple, fast-paced rules. A completely self-contained gaming system, Dux Bellorum is perfect for gamers who are looking for a way into fighting Dark Age battles without investing a lot of time or money in larger rulesets.<br/><br/>From the playtest introduction:<br/><br/>Dux Bellorum is an Arthurian-era Dark Ages wargame, set in the period from the mid fourth century AD to the end of the eighth century AD. The rules emphasise the influence an army&rsquo;s commander has on his units, with simple manoeuvre rules and chaotic, swirling close combat. You'll win by inspiring the right troops at the right time, balancing quality versus quantity in your army, and by finding a sprinkling of luck at the right time.<br/><br/>All distances are given in Base Widths, which allows the game to be used with any scale of miniature based in many different ways. An army usually has 6-12 units, and each unit is rated for Aggression (Attacks), Protection (Defence), and Cohesion (Strength) and is trained either as Shieldwall, Warriors, Riders, or Skirmishers (all of which operate differently in the game).<br/><br/>Dux Bellorum armies are selected from following lists: Late Roman, Romano-British, Welsh, Saxon, Pictish, Irish, Land Raider, Sea Raider.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.9614", "name": "Dux Bellorum", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "age": "0", "usersrated": "43", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["The Legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table", "Osprey Wargames Series"]}, "88080": {"poll": [], "name": "\u0411\u0438\u0442\u0432\u044b Fantasy", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "1995", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic879056_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["\u041e\u041e\u041e \"\u0422\u0435\u0445\u043d\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\""], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic879056.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Collectible Components", "Fantasy", "Medieval", "Miniatures", "Wargame"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "In this fantasy miniatures game players each create an army with the same number of points (with each miniature having a different point value), then take turns moving and attacking until all of the opponent's forces are dead or captured.

A miniature carrying a rocket launcher will obviously do more damage if it shoots you in the head. Huge dragons will have more hit points, and mice will have less.

Not since Spartacus had slave rebellions succeeded on such a grand scale. However, this story cannot be confined to a single leader like Toussaint. It is far more complicated, riddled with intrigue and rife with defections. There is no shortage of villains, and heroes are often conflicted. On the surface, the topic is obscure but the ramifications for this conflict were incredibly far-reaching.<br/><br/>Black Eagles is a card assisted, multi-player, area movement cube game that covers the period 1792-1804. Black Eagles is broken into four distinct scenarios: the &quot;Rights of Man,&quot; or the introduction of republican ideals to the island; &quot;Imperial Designs,&quot; or the invasion of English and Spanish forces; &quot;Civil War,&quot; internal conflict between the Mulattos and the rebel leaders; and finally &quot;Leclerc Invades,&quot; featuring Napoleon's attempt to restore slavery to the island.<br/><br/>Black Eagles allows one (yes, there is a solitaire version) to four players to command one of five historical rebel leaders, Toussaint L'Ouverture included, as well as Napoleon's veteran general Charles Victoire Emmanuel Leclerc. Those not commanded by players become factions available for alliance, along with the Gros Blancs, the Petits Blancs, the Spanish, the French, and the English, each provides the controlling player with a special ability. Alliances are fluid, as is the allegiance of the very units under your command. The more of the island's economy a player controls the more havoc he can cause with the funds he collects. On the other hand, the player who carries the least influence automatically controls the Petits Blancs and no matter how weak a player is, he can always attack a stronger player's economic base.<br/><br/>Black Eagles is no longer in its infancy. Play testing has proven it to be well worthwhile. Scenario play ranges from 90 minutes to four hours. Components include a 22&quot; by 34&quot; map, 45 card events that affect play in various turn phases  --cards also provide resolution for the devastating Yellow Fever.

It consists of two separate boardgames: &quot;Dada's World&quot;, which teaches about how to behave apropriately in given situations and answer questions about the guru's teachings; and &quot;Guess, Who Am I?&quot;, which focuses on identifying role models.<br/><br/>Game 1 (Dada's World) - Players roll a die and move along a track which represents their journey through Dada's World, collecting rectangular plastic &quot;coins&quot; with a variety of point values. <br/>Landing on marked spaces along the track can either add points (Helped Poor Person: 100), subtract points (Killed a cockroach: -150), provide the opportunity to answer questions about Dada's teachings to earn points (Dadai Dhamaka), lose turns, take extra turns, go back to Home, and other similar effects. At certain points on the track, players have the opportunity to pay points to take a shorter route.<br/>The winner is the first player to make a complete circuit of the track and return to the start space with 1500 points or more. Players who complete the track with fewer than 1500 points must go back to an earlier square and try to accumulate more points.<br/><br/>Game 2 (Guess, Who Am I?) - Players roll a die and move along a track collecting pieces of three separate puzzles. Most of the spaces on the board are marked with a statement associated with one of the three &quot;role models&quot; - Parents, Dadashri and Humanity. When landing on a space on the board, players must identify which role model is associated with the statement on that space (example: Space #17 &quot;We should bow down to them every day&quot; is associated with Parents). Correctly identifying the role model allows the player to take the puzzle piece associated with that space. <br/>Other spaces give the player a free random puzzle piece, allow the player to take a piece from another player, or cause the player to lose a turn. Players who reach the end of the track without winning the game move back to Start and continue to collect puzzle pieces.<br/>To win, a player must collect all 12 pieces of one of the three puzzles. He may then assemble the puzzle to see a picture representing one of the role models, then flip the pieces over to reveal a message.<br/><br/>From the rule booklet:<br/><br/>Hello kids!!!<br/><br/>Time to enter DADA'S WORLD filled with excitement, fun &amp; learn.....<br/><br/>This 2-in-1 Game Pack offer dual knowledge and fun, Get the tracks right from 'Home' to 'Simandhar City' and back 'Home' in Game 1.

And My Supernatural Romance could be it!<br/>My #1 design goal with this game was to make a game I could play with my non-gamer wife, inspired by Emily Care Boss's Breaking the Ice and Ron Edwards's S/Lay w/Me. We wanted the romance from Breaking the Ice, the adventure and conflict and oracles from S/Lay w/Me, and we wanted the subject matter to be something we both were into. I'm not into contemporary romances; she's not into pulp fantasy - but add vampires to your romance and it's something we both can enjoy.<br/>So this is a game that is mainly intended to create stories in the vein of Twilight and True Blood and The Little Mermaid &ndash; the protagonists fall in love with something that's outside their own species, and trouble ensues, but if you want you can easily take the mermaids, vampires, or ghosts out and tell a more standard romance novel story &ndash; not so much the &ldquo;bodice ripper&rdquo; sort of romance, but the romance of the formula: girl meets boy; boy is kind of an asshole; they dance around each other for a while; turns out the boy had a reason for being an asshole and they get together. Pride and Prejudice made the mold and thousands of stories have been fabricated therein.<br/>You may think &quot;I hate romance, this isn't for me&quot;, but wait - almost every movie has a love subplot, even if it's not the main plot, and some movies, like Wall-E and Spider-Man 2, the love story is the main plot and saving the world is actually the sub-plot! Even Fight Club: meeting Marla Singer is what drives the book and the movie, is what turns Edward Norton to Brad Pitt. So there - maybe you like romance more than you think. And yet love is very under-represented in games - even story games and RPGs - and for good reason. For one thing, love stories and ensemble casts don't go together - for a love story to work in a game, you probably only want 2 players.

At the left end of this area, a &quot;pitch star&quot; shows the pitch which the player is singing and provides feedback on whether (s)he's hitting the notes. A &quot;crowd meter&quot; shows the mood of the crowd as the player sings; if s/he does a good job of hitting notes on-pitch then the crowd will cheer more loudly and clap in rhythm with the song, and the scene will become more vividly animated. If the crowd meter falls all the way to the lowest rating, the audience will boo the character off-stage and the game is over.<br/><br/>Each song is divided into approximately 30 to 50 &quot;phrases&quot;. A meter will fill up and turn from red to green for each phrase, based on how well the player sings the right notes; if the player can fill the meter to green, (s)he will score more points, and getting several greens in a row will create a &quot;combo&quot; and award a 2x score multiplier until the player fails to make green on another phrase. This blue meter resembles how long you should hold the note for and at what pitch. The game can be set at higher difficulties which make this meter larger and require the player to hit the right notes more precisely to fill it to green.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaoke_Revolution,&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaoke_Revolution,&quot</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "88189": {"poll": [], "name": "Crazy Climber", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Arcade game", "Atari 2600 edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic889837.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Other"], "usersrated": "5", "videogamedeveloper": ["Nihon Bussan"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade", "Scrolling"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade", "Atari 2600"], "average": "7.2", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Atari, Inc.", "Nihon Bussan"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic889837_t.jpg", "description": "In Crazy Climber the player assumes the role of a daredevil who is attempting to climb to the top of four skyscrapers.

The German armies in France had ceased being organized formations and were streaming back to the Reich in willy nilly fashion, hotly pursued by the Western Allied armies as they dashed through Paris and to the borders of Germany. The First US Army (with the Ninth later on), hit the Westwall on September 12th and was destined to slog through the mud and rain for months against the fortifications and surprisingly resilient German reserves hurriedly thrown against them in a desperate bid to keep the American army off as much German soil as possible. Additionally, lack of supply served to further restrain the American advance. Would the war be over by Christmas, or would the Germans pull off a second &ldquo;Miracle of the Marne&rdquo; and hold long enough to launch a counteroffensive in the west ?<br/><br/><br/>(from Decision Games website:)<br/><br/>HURTGEN: Hell&rsquo;s Forest is a grand-tactical simulation of that enormous campaign. The 2,240 counters in the game represent almost every formation, at company and battalion levels, which fought in the battle, including US, German, British, and even Belgian units. Infantry, armor, anti-tank, reconnaissance, engineer, assault gun, howitzer, rocket, parachute, ranger, glider, and headquarters units are all fully represented in the counter-mix. The two map sections are an accurate representation of the battle area and were compiled from 1944 German staff maps and 1943-1944 US Army map sources. The area portrayed shows all primary and secondary roads, trails and other types of terrain in relation to their suitability for armor and infantry, along with all the villages, towns and  cities that proved to be the bastions of the German defense, as well as every creek and river that couldn't be crossed by wheeled vehicles without a bridge.<br/><br/>THERE are three main scenarios representing each of the offensive periods of September, October and November. A smaller learning scenario depicts the US 28th Infantry Division&rsquo;s ordeal as it attempted to drive on the Roer River dams through the forest of the area. Players may also play continuously from September to the first week of December (almost 300 game turns!). The big challenge for the allied player is to see if he can reach the Rhine River months ahead of the actual date, and shorten the war considerably. Extensive supply, weather and air power rules are included.<br/><br/>THIS latest edition of the Grand Operational Simulation Series (which began with Wacht am Rhein) presents further refinements to the combat, artillery and supply subsystems in order to better depict tactical and operational warfare at this scale. For example, rules for &ldquo;Lull&rdquo; periods have been added in order to allow players to speed up game play during periods of relative inactivity. These Lulls compress game play from three turns per day to one, allowing players to cover longer intervals of historic time. Other additions feature level-two entrenchments that allow the German player to create fortified bastions in German towns and cities that can better withstand Allied barrages and ground assaults, along with rules that represent the logistical nightmare faced by the Americans during much of the battle.<br/><br/>THE orders of battle have been extensively researched in order to provide an accurate and functional depiction of the armies of both sides. The incredibly hodge podge nature of the resurrecting German army is shown through the depiction of the various rear area units and replacement army battalions that appear almost randomly throughout the game.<br/><br/>GAME SCALE<br/>&bull; Map: 1 mile per hex<br/>&bull; Time: 3 Game Turns per day<br/>&bull; Units: Infantry and Artillery are battalions.

Players begin the game &quot;snowed in&quot; requiring them to &quot;dig out,&quot; or score 100 points before they may begin collecting points. The first player to score 1,000 or more points wins the game! The game has a strategy component where players may trap other players in the cabin, preventing them from scoring.<br/><br/>Special scoring situations have easily recognizable winter themed monikers. Players encounter obstacles along the way in the form of certain types of die rolls (&quot;squalls,&quot; &quot;thaws,&quot; &quot;broken chairlifts&quot;) which may end their turn or put them in the cabin. In addition to obstacles there are special die rolls that immediately reward a player such as &quot;vacations&quot; and &quot;chairlifts&quot;.<br/><br/>Setup<br/>Cabin Fever is designed for 2-8 players with an optimal number of 3 or more players. A game can be played with more than 8 players at the consequence of extending the game's duration. All that is needed in addition to the game is a pad of paper and a pencil or pen with which to keep score.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Each player rolls a single die to determine who starts the game. The highest roll goes first (after resolving ties). All players are considered &ldquo;snowed in&rdquo; and must &quot;dig out&quot; by rolling 100 points or more on the scoring dice. Once a player digs out he or she ends his or her turn and passes the scoring dice to the next player on the left (clockwise) and may begin scoring on his or her next turn. The first player to accumulate 1,000 points wins the game!<br/><br/>The five same color dice included with the game are called scoring dice. Players start a turn by rolling all five dice (opening roll) in an attempt to create matching die faces. Players may elect to end their turn at any time and collect their points (with a minimum requirement of a matching pair). Players may continue a turn to earn more points but must roll at least one match to an existing match, or create a new matching set on each consecutive re-roll of non-matching dice. Dice that have been assigned to a match may not be re-rolled. If players fail to roll a match on a re-roll they immediately end their turn and do not collect any points.<br/><br/>Components<br/>    * 5 Scoring Dice (white)<br/>    * 1 Vacation Die (green)<br/>    * Cabin game piece (clear)<br/>    * Cabin Fever rules sheet<br/>    * 3 &quot;I have Cabin Fever!&quot; stickers<br/>    * Palm-sized, clear acrylic, travel box<br/><br/>"}, "88220": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jean Manuel Morales"], "poll": [], "name": "Sicic", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Building"], "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Combinatorial"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1202861_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1202861.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Sicic is a game for two.

The Astronomer may choose not to move, in order to &ldquo;pinch&rdquo; one of the opponent&rsquo;s Astronomers set in a neighbouring square.

Players create a character by distributing points between three stats: Life, (which decrease with each wound), Strength (expended in fighting robots) and agility (used for jumping over holes). Once done, the player enter the research complex. There are elevators that allow travel to the upper floor, holes that lead to the floor below (there are different keys that allow the character to cross over a hole safely) and a lot of robots to destroy (by hand-to-hand combat or by pushing them in a hole) or dodge. The goal is to pick up enough items (or destroy enough robots) to increase the &quot;Fifth axis&quot; score by 10%, at which point the player is sent in time to retrieve a VPS part. The player must run to the location of the part while dodging hazards (spears, arrows, falling rocks...) before the timer reach zero.<br/><br/>Le 5eme Axe is one of the few Amstrad CPC arcade games to have a savegame feature implemented.<br/><br/>"}, "88223": {"poll": [], "name": "SpongeBob SquarePants Battle for Bikini Bottom", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US GameCube edition", "US PlayStation 2 edition", "US PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits edition", "US Windows edition", "US Xbox edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic951781.png", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon"], "videogamefranchise": ["Greatest Hits (Best Selling PlayStation Games, US)", "Spongebob Squarepants"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Azure Wish Enterprise (AWE)", "Heavy Iron Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure", "Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["GameCube", "PlayStation 2", "Windows", "Xbox"], "usersrated": "8", "average": "5.25", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["THQ"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic951781_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Play as SpongeBob, Patrick and Sandy while you explore Bikini Bottom and defend against Plankton's evil robots.<br/><br/>"}, "88224": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Richard Hutnik"], "poll": [], "name": "Sophia", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Building", "Pattern Recognition"], "yearpublished": "1995", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1035722_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1035722.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Print and Play edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Sophia is played on a 4x4 square board.

The system takes away from Second World War and goes to Ancients. In 264 Roma was summoned to Messina by Mamertines mercenaries to help in their quarrel with Cartage, the main power in Sicily. Carthaginians count on Hiero the Tirant of Syracuse to help defeating the Mamertines. Here begins the First Punic War.<br/>Romans and Carthaginians fought for 22 year over Sicily and in North Africa. Rome emerged victorious and Cartage was obliged to quit his long standing presence in Sicily.<br/>The land campaign was a long string of Roman victories as city after city was subdued and every Carthaginian army was defeated in battle. Syracuse was forced to make an alliance with Rome and Cartage was left with only a few fortresses in the island.<br/>Anyway the war was won and lost in the sea. The war saw the emergence of Rome as a sea-power and a long string of naval victories allow Roman troops to menace even Cartage proper. Only to be saved by Xantipus and his mercenary army at the Bagradas Plains battle. Naval warfare played a prominent role in this war and will give Carthage Senate his las blow. Carthage tried to spend the Roman effort during the whole war. His strategy was of attrition and was unsuccessful; Rome never gave up a prize.<br/>The game is developed in an operational scale &ndash; area-based map. It is designed for two players with one running the ROMAN forces and the other the CARTHAGINIAN forces -including Syracuse. The game lasts approximately 3-4 hours and uses a two sided system to handle the mechanics of play: cards and counters. The players will have to use their troops and their resources to obtain victory points while eliminating enemy forces and occupying cities in the map. It is not a card driven game as the cards are used to bring about events that influence battles, secure reinforcements, and provide resources with which to carry on the fight.<br/>The ROMAN player will be on the offensive during the whole game as he has to conquer the whole island to get victory. CARTHAGINIAN player focuses on spoiling Roman campaigns and plans with ambushes, sallies and bad weather cards. Also he has to recruit an army as he doesn&acute;t has any at the beginning of the game.<br/>The ROMAN player must plan his offensives carefully as he will need a new army and resources for each one. Also he will need to build a fleet his doesn&acute;t have at the start of the war. The sea contest will be evenly match and you better take into account bad weather as it sinks more ships than enemy action.<br/>Siege warfare takes a prominent role in this game as every city in the game map is a walled on with his own intrinsic garrison.<br/>Like all the games of this Series, the rules are simple and straight forward. Our objective was to create games that are very interactive, and offer players a pleasant creative experience. We aim for solid games for players who do not have the time or the space to leave a game setup and in place over a long period of play.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>- 1 80x60 cm map of Sicily and North Africa.<br/>- two ten-sided dice<br/>- 176 unit counters<br/>- 1 Rules Book for the Series &ldquo;Campaign Commander&rdquo; and Exclusive Rules of &ldquo;Punic Island&rdquo;; historical and designer notes.<br/>- 70 cards (divided in two decks, plus help cards)<br/>- 3 plastic bags.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Punic Island (Spanish version)"], "average": "7.38158", "name": "Campaign Commander Volume III: Punic Island", "playingtime": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Area-Impulse", "Dice Rolling", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "38", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Campaign Commander"]}, "88248": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "MiYu the Game", "playingtime": "40", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Co-operative Play"], "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2596972_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["University Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2596972.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch First Edtion", "German edition"], "maxplaytime": "40", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Religious"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "40", "description": "With this game players will try to look into their future.<br/><br/>The game is placed in the center of the table.

A map of the stage is shown before it begins, and after which, Jackson must get from the start to the end without losing all his health, rescuing all the children and defeating all the enemies along the way.<br/><br/>The game can also be played multiplayer; if the cabinet supports it, up to three people can play simultaneously. All three players play as Jackson, dressed in his suit from the &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; music video. The first player wears a white suit and hat, with a blue shirt; the second player's character dons a scarlet outfit with a white shirt; the third player's character is dressed in black, with a red shirt. The characters all have armbands: blue for white outfit, white for red outfit, and red for black outfit.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Michael Jackson's Moonwalker&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "88288": {"poll": [], "name": "Michael Jackson's Moonwalker (Console)", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["European Game Gear edition", "European Master System edition", "European Mega Drive edition", "Japanese Game Gear edition", "Japanese Master System edition", "Japanese Mega Drive edition", "US Game Gear edition", "US Genesis edition", "US Master System edition"], "average": "6.10938", "videogametheme": ["Movie, Book, TV show", "Music", "Science Fiction"], "videogamegenre": ["Beat 'em Up", "Platform"], "videogamedeveloper": ["SEGA Corporation"], "videogamefranchise": ["Michael Jackson"], "videogameplatform": ["SEGA Game Gear", "SEGA Genesis", "SEGA Master System"], "usersrated": "16", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SEGA Corporation"], "description": "The story, which is taken from the Moonwalker film, follows Michael, using various music and dance related abilities, on a quest to save kidnapped children from the hands of the evil &quot;Mr. Big&quot;. The games incorporated synthesized versions of the musician's hits, such as &quot;Beat It&quot; and &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot;.<br/><br/>Home versions of the game were released for Sega's Mega Drive/Genesis and Master System home video game systems, as well as the Sega Game Gear handheld system, though the gameplay was completely different from the arcade version. A version has also been rated by PEGI for an upcoming release on Virtual Console.[4], but no confirmation of which version. The home console versions of the game were actually based on an evolved version of the home computer version of the game (with gameplay somewhat similar to the Shinobi series), in contrast to the arcade version which was a three-quarters view shooter/fighter type game. The game involved the player controlling the pop star in a quest to save all the kids that had been kidnapped by Mr. Big. In the arcade version, Katie was one of three types of children who could be rescued, in the home version, all of the captive children are young blond girls termed &quot;Katies&quot;, although Zeke appears in the end sequence.<br/><br/>The game's levels and music were borrowed from the film (though many of the music tracks were taken from Jackson's Thriller album as well) and the player had the ability to destroy enemies by making them dance. In the console game Michael could become a robot by rescuing a certain child first, and then grabbing a comet that fell from the sky. In the arcade version, Michael became a robot by rescuing his chimp pal Bubbles. The arcade version also had the novel feature of three simultaneous players (each controlling Jackson's character in a different-colored &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; outfit).<br/><br/>The gameplay is focused on finding children, all of whom resemble Katie from the movie, which are scattered throughout the level, some behind certain objects such as doors. Most of the objects are empty or contain enemies. In contrast to the arcade version, Michael's moves more closely resemble his trademark dancing moves. For example, the standard attack is a stylized high kick that is commonly incorporated into his dance routines. If the player continues to hold the kick button, and moves michael backwards, he performs Michael's signature Moonwalk dance move. The player has combination health/ability bar. One button will allow Michael to spin, being invulnerable in the process. However, this spin move will slowly lose health. If the spin is held for more than two seconds, Michael will throw his hat in a fashion of a boomerang which will destroy most enemies. The longer the spin move is held, the wider distance that the fedora will cover. If held down long enough, a dance magic scene similar to the arcade version would play, featuring dance moves taken from the film clips of whatever song is playing in the background. Michael can also use the magic to slide down banisters and eliminate multiple enemies in the process. In certain levels, a shooting star may appear which temporarily transforms Micheal into a cyborg that can attack enemies with various artillery, though cannot collect children. Almost every stage has three levels, designated in Super Mario Bros. fashion as X-1, X-2, X-3. However, the final level of the Mega Drive/Sega Genesis version was a first person &quot;flight sim&quot; type battle between Michael (now transformed into a space ship) and Mr. Big's ship.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Michael Jackson's Moonwalker&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "88289": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic863442.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Katrin Kurik", "Janari Lage", "Tiit Naarits", "K\u00fclli Nidermann", "Tarmo Tuule"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "11", "age": "7", "boardgamepublisher": ["AS Ajakirjade kirjastus"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic863442_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Educational", "Trivia"], "description": "Laste m&auml;lum&auml;ngudoomino is a junior version of M\u00e4lum\u00e4ngudoomino<br/><br/>Game mechanics are the same: trivia game with domino pieces.

The first was a top-down maze-style level based on the 'Speed Demon' short, involving wandering the studio to collect various items and costume pieces, with the final piece being the motorcycle, all whilst trying to avoid the crazed fans. Stealth elements were used, with an onscreen map similar to that used in Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake. The next level had similar gameplay, riding the motorcycle collecting tokens, upon which turning into a car in order to jump a barrier to the next part.<br/><br/>The third level was a sort of side-scrolling level based on the &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; clip, collecting ammunition and shooting at gangsters in openings above you.<br/><br/>The final level involved morphing into a robot and shooting at soldiers in openings, with the player controlling a crosshair.

The setting is very similar to that of Dungeons and Dragons and other medieval fantasy worlds, with familiar monsters such as Orcs, Gnolls, Harpies, Wyverns, Cyclopes, and Minotaurs. The game has 16 levels, though many are quite short.<br/><br/>Much like Capcom's Knights of the Round, King of Dragons features an RPG-like level advancement system. Points scored for killing monsters and picking up gold count towards experience, and the character gains levels at regular intervals. With each level, the character's health bar increases, other attributes such as range improve, and the character also becomes invulnerable for a few seconds. Along the way, different weapon and armor upgrades for each character may also be picked up.<br/><br/>King of Dragons features a simple control system that consists of a single attack button, and a jump button. By pressing both buttons, the character unleashes a magical attack that strikes all enemies in screen (its strength varies according to the character used) at the expense of losing energy. The fighter, cleric and dwarf can also use their shield to block certain attacks by tilting the joystick back right before the impact.<br/><br/>The game was ported to the Super NES in 1994. This port reduces the number of simultaneous players down to 2. The sprites' size were also reduced moderately. It is also possible to assign the magic attack and shield defense to different buttons.<br/><br/>The arcade version is part of Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2, which was released for the PS2 &amp; Xbox in November 2006.

You&rsquo;re a digital snake, trapped in an arena with several other snakes. As you move, you leave body segments behind you. Your goal is to eliminate your opponents by forcing your opponents to crash into the edge of the board or and section of any other player.<br/><br/>Play is simultaneous (so there's no down time) and proceeds through the following phases: plan, challenge, resolve.  During planning, you have a just a handful seconds to pick a direction and a speed for your snake. When all instructions are revealed, any player may spend a token to challenge another player.  If you're challenged, you have to flick a token onto a chart; where it lands dictates your speed for the turn.  During resolution, you move the snakes, add body segments, and check for collisions.<br/><br/>Grid Snakes uses a large and a small custom board, several small custom decks of cards (eight cards each), some nickels or quarters, and a lot of colored glass beads (or other small tokens). The rules and cards are available at: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.invisible-city.com/file_download/165/' rel='nofollow'>http://www.invisible-city.com/file_download/165/</a><br/><br/>Grid Snakes has fairly simple rules, but requires quick decision making and planning.

Tigele like the other Volumes is a standalone game. Meaning as it comes out of the box,  it is a working game. Tigele may be added to other volumes as an expansion. Or the other volumes may be added to it, in part or whole, as expansions. Or this volume may be mixed with parts of the other volumes to form whole new games.<br/><br/>Tigele is a battle strategy game made up of 100 tiles comprised of 72 pictographs forming just several tile types. the game was played by a small community of individuals in the North west corner of Montana for almost 20 years. Slowly evolving into this publish version. (Long cold winters and beer)<br/><br/>Oddities of the game:<br/>1) We call the game a board game, even though it is a tile game; because, the tiles in part make up the playing area, a 10 X 10 layout of tile we call a field. The field is comprised of two opponents laid out in 10 X 5 (1/2 the field we call the courts). That area once established remains a constant grid for play throughout the game. Thus the tiles making a randomized board.<br/><br/>2) The tiles used above are the playing board and the playing pieces.<br/><br/>3) The game uses the relationships of one tiles to another as a mechanic to manipulate luck, and unforeseen or uncontrolled  events. This also encourages ever developing tactics and interpersonal strategies (more so when later volumes are played in concert with one another).<br/><br/>4) The box instructions gives two player mode instruction. but the game plays up to 4 players in the Volume One level. The 3 and 4 player modes of play are suggested on our web site.<br/><br/>5) The game was designed for two primary reasons. To help keep the designer brother out of trouble and as a model of one basic form of social political behavior...Don't ask me.<br/><br/>6) Hard rules augmented with a few soft rules. the soft rules force personal interaction and create a fog of war atmosphere...again don't ask me...it just works.<br/><br/>7) Players on your side of play may or may not really be playing on your side.<br/><br/>8) The game uses its art as a fog of war mechanism.<br/><br/>9) The game has a slight learning curve; but the game is basic in  play.<br/><br/>"}, "88404": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic888425.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ray Tapio"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "10", "boardgamepublisher": ["Critical Hit, Inc."], "maxplaytime": "180", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic888425_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "ATS Expansion Pack 6- Killing Fields continues the series of expansions for the first ATS series boxed game Advanced Tobruk.

Featuring direct head-to-head combat, amazing art, a new AEG world, and unique mechanics by designer David Gregg, Nightfall will be the deck-building game to own.<br/><br/>Before the game begins, there is a draft to determine which cards are available for purchase, and by whom. During this draft players select two cards from the set for their personal archives, and they also select cards to put into the common area. The cards drafted into personal archives may only be purchased by the player who drafted them.<br/><br/>After the table has been set with the private and common cards, players begin play.<br/><br/>The meat of Nightfall is in the chaining mechanic, which was partially developed with the help of people right here on BoardGameGeek.<br/><br/>Each card has a main color and two linking colors. If you can match the main color of a card to one of the linking colors of the previous card, you can chain those cards together. Once a chain is started, players all get an opportunity to link additional cards onto the chain during that turn.<br/><br/>Cards in the chain resolve in reverse order: first in, last out. Instant effects fire off as cards come off the chain, doing damage to your opponents or bringing characters into play to defend you and attack your opponents.<br/><br/>The object of Nightfall is to put wounds into your opponents&rsquo; decks and end the game with the least amount of wounds in your deck. But beware: the more wounds a person has, the more enraged they become and the faster their deck works, meaning more cards and bigger chains will come your way!<br/><br/>Nightfall's base set releases with starting decks of 12 cards for up to 5 players, and 24 distinct cards (7 copies of each) for drafting during play.<br/><br/>The box contains card dividers, and is in the same format as the much heralded Wrath of the Elements box for Thunderstone.<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/>    Nightfall: Martial Law<br/>    Nightfall: Blood Country<br/>    Nightfall: The Coldest War<br/>    Nightfall: Dark Rages<br/>    Nightfall: Eastern Skies<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["AEG Preview edition", "English first edition", "French first edition", "German first edition", "Polish first edition"], "boardgameintegration": ["Nightfall: Eastern Skies", "Nightfall: Martial Law", "Nightfall: The Coldest War", "Nightfall: Eastern Skies", "Nightfall: Martial Law", "Nightfall: The Coldest War"], "average": "6.53894", "name": "Nightfall", "videogamebg": ["Nightfall"], "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Deck / Pool Building", "Hand Management", "Pattern Building", "Take That", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["Nightfall: \"Ghost One\" Promo", "Nightfall: \"Shadow Seven\" Promo", "Nightfall: Ahmad Hassan Promo", "Nightfall: Ausnahmezustand", "Nightfall: Bloated Corpse Promo", "Nightfall: Blood Country", "Nightfall: Crimson Siege", "Nightfall: Dark Rages", "Nightfall: Desperate Measures Promo", "Nightfall: Destiny Collins Promo", "Nightfall: Flayed Ghoul Promo", "Nightfall: Lisaveta Florescu", "Nightfall: Pale Fury Promo", "Nightfall: Silas Bragg Promo", "Nightfall: Zombie Horde Promo", "Nightfall: Zombify Promo"], "usersrated": "3433", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Nightfall"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 36: Losing Geek Cred - Nothing Personal + Guilty Pleasures", "Episode 54 - Flippin Vermin", "Episode 8 - Oh The Joy.", "Episode Thirteen of The Gaming Gang", "House Rules 14: Operation GamerWife Progresses", "House Rules Episode 6: After Dark\u2014A Discussion of Nightfall", "I've Been Diced! episode 33: Go east, middle-aged man!", "Little Metal Dog Show - Episode 18", "Podcast #038 - Mercaderes de la Edad Media", "Session Impressions: Nightfall", "Strange Assembly 017 - Resolution", "Strange Assembly 020 - Dead of Night", "Strange Assembly 061 - GenCon 2012 AEG Interviews", "The Game Pit: Episode 58  - Nations and More\u2026.", "The Spiel #123 - The Postman Always Brings Dice"]}, "88409": {"rpgdesigner": ["Tim Dugger"], "rpg": ["HARP Fantasy"], "statistics": [], "name": "HARPer's Bazaar Annual", "rpgartist": ["Toren Atkinson", "Peter Bergting", "David Bezzina", "Joel Biske", "John Dollar", "Craig Henderson", "Mike Jackson", "Jeff Laubenstein", "Cara Mitten", "Jeremy Mohler", "Sherry Robinson", "Colin Throm", "Keirston Vande Kraats", "Jonathan White"], "rpgproducer": ["Tim Dugger", "Heike Kubasch", "Jeff Laubenstein"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic910123.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover Version"], "average": "5.83333", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Iron Crown Enterprises"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic910123_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>Searching for additional material to enrich your HARP gaming?

However, also included is an entire new Campaign called Fuger's Ostliche Wut, or Fuger's Eastern Fury, for you to fight as either German or Russian, based on actions between 1943 and 1944. Each Battle and Operation has been carefully made with in depth briefings related to actual events, and will give you hints about the battle and what you may expect. We have tried hard to make the balance of play suitable for a newcomer to the game, making it neither too hard or too easy.<br/><br/>There are 26 new maps never released before and 6 modified maps from the original game, gathered together in 12 Operations spanning 12 months of the Russian Front Campaign, from dry summer landscapes through mud and snow.<br/><br/>Revised Data.The Teams, Units, Weapons, and Data have been revised with new Graphics and more accurate performance. The AI has been modified to reduce many of the problems experienced with the original release of Close Combat III, and it is of course now Windows XP and DirectX friendly.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "88420": {"videogame": ["Close Combat IV: The Battle of the Bulge"], "poll": [], "name": "Close Combat: Wacht am Rhein", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows CD-ROM edition", "Worldwide Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic873406.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Close Combat (Core Series)"], "videogametheme": ["War - World War II"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Atomic Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Real Time Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "9", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Matrix Games"], "videogamecompilation": ["Close Combat IV: The Battle of the Bulge"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic873406_t.jpg", "description": "Based on Atomic Games&rsquo; award-winning Close Combat series, Close Combat: Wacht am Rhein brings together the classic top-down tactical gameplay from the original series and plenty of new features, expansions, and improvements!

Be as artistic as you like in this. Stairs and doors always have traps. Each door you roll will enter into a room, and there will always be a unlocked exit door in an adjacent wall. The T corridor branches off into other hallways and you may backtrack your path if you wish during exploration.<br/><br/>If you roll a door or a stair check first for a trap by rolling the 3 trap dice, if two faces match that trap is sprung.<br/><br/>Next, if you rolled a door, you enter the room. Roll the colored monster die to see what level of monster you will fight, and roll the corresponding colored monster die to see what you will fight. You always have initiative in an encounter.<br/><br/>To battle:<br/><br/>Roll your Battle Strength die and add that value to your Battle Strength for a magical weapon if you possess one. Then roll for the monster. Depending on the color and type of monster they will have different strengths and powers as summarized in the rules.<br/><br/>Once you have defeated a monster you may roll for treasure using the Treasure Die.<br/><br/>Explore the dungeon until you defeat/kill all the monsters you are required to.

On each stage, the player can enter doors to hide from enemies (a feature inspired by Taito's Elevator Action), as well jump over to higher or lower floors with rails, including stairs (a feature reused in Sega's Shinobi). The stages in &quot;Story 2&quot; are essentially harder version of their &quot;Story 1&quot; counterparts, featuring more traps and different enemy placement. At the end of each stage, scenes from Leila's capture and ensuing torture are shown on a large monitor screen.<br/><br/>The player begins the game armed with a standard-issue pistol, which can be substituted with a fully-automatic assault rifle that allows for continuous firing by holding down the shoot button. The player can find ammunition for either weapon by entering doors which are marked &quot;bullets&quot; or &quot;arms&quot;. If the player runs out of machine gun ammo, they will switch back to the pistol. However, if the pistol runs out of ammo as well, then the player can only fire a single slow &quot;chaser&quot; bullets on-screen at a time until more ammo is acquired. Despite the presence of a life meter, the player can only take two physical hits from the enemy: a single hit drains half of the meter and the player is killed instantly when struck by a projectile attack such as enemy bullets or lasers.<br/><br/>The main enemies in Rolling Thunder are hooded soldiers known as &quot;Maskers&quot;. Maskers are dressed in various outfits and colors, which determines their strength and attacking pattern respectively. Some Maskers do not shoot, but throw grenades instead, while others will shoot their gun below waist-level. Other enemies include mutated bats, shrieking yellow creatures and lava men. At the end of the tenth and final stage, the player must battle Geldra leader Maboo to rescue Leila and complete their mission.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Rolling Thunder (arcade game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "88437": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jonas Berntsson", "Samir El-Sabini", "Marqus Embe", "Nils Jernberg", "David Palm", "Jimmy Rajden", "Jakob S\u00fcld", "Emil Sundman"], "statistics": [], "name": "Utgard (Issue 1)", "rpgartist": ["Jonas Berntsson", "Niklas Ferm", "Carlos Lundhall", "Jimmy Rajden"], "rpgproducer": ["Jonas Berntsson"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic868702.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Utgard"], "rpg": ["Drakar och Demoner Trudvang (7th & 8th Editions)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["Issue 1"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic868702_t.jpg", "description": "This was the first issue of this web-published fanzine focusing on the RPG Drakar och Demoner Trudvang.

Should the Axis player assign his few support assets to his best divisions to form powerful strike groups, or should he use them to augment his light units desperately defending the ridges?<br/>Patton&rsquo;s First Victory portrays all the elements of the actual campaign.

You will see why the 10th Panzer Division was so formidable, and how Patton was able to defeat the vestige of the famed Afrikakorps.<br/>The entire Tunisian campaign can be played in a couple hours, yet Patton&rsquo;s First Victory remains a game requiring operational skill. The Allied player must maintain the momentum and keep pressure on the Axis, fighting for a breakthrough to capture enough of the important Tunisian harbors to win the game. The Axis player must manage his scant yet potent army and air force to repel the attacking Allies, all the while watching for opportunities to counterattack and throw the throw them back in disarray.<br/>Patton&rsquo;s First Victory is a quick and easy game of the 1943 campaign between Allied and Axis forces in North Africa during World War II. It&rsquo;s spring 1943; the Allies have arrived to liberate Tunisia from the Axis, but the Axis soldiers are experienced and commanded by some of the best generals of the war. If Axis forces can hold on in the Tunisian mountains, they can delay the progress of the war in the west indefinitely.

The use of area movement instead of hexes. Each area is a province. It speeds up the game. By organizing combats in an area, similar dynamic like that of hex and counters has been maintained.<br/>2. The use of generic units instead of unit IDs. This is a tough choice. It reduces the effort of the player to locate individual units, and makes it more flexible in losses and breakdowns calculations. Historical unit IDs are provided in the OB for those who are interested in unit history.<br/>3. A 2-players instead of a 3-players game. The game is now played between the KMT and Japan players.

Budapest fell in February, and Vienna was captured in April.
