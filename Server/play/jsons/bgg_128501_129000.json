In this case 74 spaces divide the starting square from the finishing square with an emerald.<br/><br/>The game is a typical roll-and-move game, combining some different genre elements. Before the game starts, players have to choose 1 of the 4 game's characters. Two of them (Pardoes, Pardijn) represent the heroes in the story depicted, while the two other characters (Rattar, Pantagor) are the villains in this game.<br/><br/>A basic turn consists of rolling 1D6 and moving your character the according number of spaces towards the finish.<br/><br/>The board contains a number 'white twinkles' and 'green lightnings' (4 of each), which work just like S'nakes and Ladders'. The white twinkles work as ladders for the heroes and as snakes for the villains; the green lightnings work the other way around.<br/><br/>The board also contains two sections with spinning arrows. If your move ends on a square in such a section, you spin that section's arrow and move to the square indicated by the arrow.<br/><br/>Other squares let you take an action card (some are to be executed immediately, others can be kept for later in the game) or invoke a duel between you and another player. Each of the duelling secretly chooses 1 card from a set of 3 (water, fire and wood) and reveal this card simultaneously. Water beats fire, fire burns wood and wood floats on water. The winner of the duel   gets a bonus move.<br/><br/>A duel is also fought when a player lands on a square with another player's piece. In this case the winner of the duel gets to stay on the square where as the loser goes backwards the number of squares indicated by 1D6.<br/><br/>"}, "128504": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "De Grote Efteling Kennisquiz", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["De Efteling"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1728043_t.jpg", "average": "7.75", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Identity Games International B.V."], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1728043.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First tin box edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Trivia"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "This trivia game was released for the 60th aniversary of the Dutch theme park Efteling in 2012.

Whoever ends up with the biggest stack of loot at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player secretly takes one of the five burglar tiles, which come in five different colors; each player also receives 2-4 helping hand tokens. Five locations are set out, each with two randomly chosen equipment tokens next to them; equipment tokens come in five types, with each type appearing in the five colors of the burglars. Special tokens are placed out as well: two loot tokens next to the bank, one lock on the museum, and one tunnel next to the manor; six additional loot tokens, along with a car token and the second tunnel, are placed to the side. Three randomly drawn equipment tokens are placed face up.<br/><br/>At the start of each round, the matchmaker determines the alliances for that round, placing two alliance markers &ndash; each showing a burglar in the appropriate color &ndash; in one area and the other three in the other area. Thus, the burglars form provisional teams for the round and are trying to work together to rob a location &ndash; any location! &ndash; but they don't necessarily know who's who. On a turn a player either:<br/><br/><br/>    Chooses one of the face-up equipment tokens, places it next to a location (with no more than three tokens of the same type being allowed at a location), then reveals a new equipment token.<br/>    Draws the top equipment token from the stack, then places it at a location.<br/>    Plays a helping hand token to move a special token or add a new special token to a location.<br/><br/><br/>As soon as all five types of equipment are at a location, a burglary takes place there. Who steals the goods? The alliance that has the larger presence there based on the colors of tokens. These tokens are then flipped face down (becoming loot), added to any loot tokens present there, then split among the burglars in the alliance and placed on the scoreboard. The matchmaker token passes to a new player, who must move at least two alliance tokens, then a new round begins.<br/><br/>The special tokens naturally change the rules: The location with the lock cannot be robbed, although someone can choose to move the lock so that a burglary does take place. The car allows someone to move an equipment token to a new location. When the second tunnel is placed next to a location, the two locations with tunnels are now linked and the types of equipment present are considered to be together when determining whether a burglary takes place &ndash; although if the lock is on one of those locations, then nothing can be stolen!<br/><br/>A brigadier token is shuffled into the final six equipment tokens, and when it's drawn, the game ends immediately.

Yes, it's been a long road from issue #8, and the delays have been annoying, probably more so to me than to you. I truly did not enjoy having what I consider one of my greatest achievements online and being updated.<br/><br/>There were a couple big reasons for this delay. The major one was the server move - we're now located at a new host and I firmly intend to stay at this host until hell freezes over. The second one was my new job - not a white collar job like some expect, but a good old fashioned dirty job inside and outside of a sugar processing plant. I&rsquo;m no longer employed there (Laid off, not fired..), so things are returning to normal now. Unfortunately, I was working 12 hour days for most of the last couple months, which gave me almost no time to do anything online besides retrieve my email and chat a bit on IRC.<br/><br/>Speaking of email - do not use my old email address anymore. The email address that you must use if you wish me to read it is the new one. If you sent email to my old address and did not receive a response, please re-send it as it may have got lost in the abyss.<br/><br/>The fate of the Compiled Shadowrun Supplemental has been decided. I'll be releasing it sometime after issue #10 arrives, and it will combine issues #1-#9, update them for SR3 mechanics, add some new items that fit in with the old themes, and remove outdated articles, or articles which got mostly negative responses. It will be a series of files separated into categories, such as Rules, Races, etc.<br/><br/>Also, web-surfers will note that this is the first issue of The Shadowrun Supplemental released in HTML format as well as Word and Adobe Portable Document Format. While I still recommend the latter two formats for printing, the HTML version allows you to read it online and make a decision if you want to download the whole magazine.<br/><br/>"}, "128546": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Shadowrun Supplemental (Issue 10 - 1999)", "rpgdesigner": ["Brett Borger", "Eleanor Holmes", "Adam Jury", "Steven Ratkovich", "Alexandre van Chestein"], "rpgproducer": ["Adam Jury"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1421084.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["The Shadowrun Supplemental"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Editorial Verbiage", "A Little Learning", "QTTV News Tonight: Shadows of Crime", "Quicksilver Lightning", "SwiftOne Speaks", "Table of Contents"], "rpg": ["Shadowrun (3rd Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1421084_t.jpg", "description": "From the Editorial Verbiage:<br/><br/>Welcome to #10.

For the first time in the two plus years since starting TSS, the magazine has a staff. It has more structure than it as ever had before. It has a future should I decide I no longer wish to work on the magazine. The changes have revitalized my outlook towards the magazine, and I look forward to working on many more issues. It&rsquo;s a long way until triple digits, though..<br/><br/>It also means I get the chance to delegate a bit of work around, which I&rsquo;m sure the people who send in submissions and then don&rsquo;t hear back from me for weeks at a time appreciate. I also have some more organization on my end regarding this, so those problems should be left in the dust.<br/><br/>Something else that&rsquo;s important to some readers - there is no longer a Word or RTF version of the magazine. The reason for that is simple - issues 1 through 9 were compiled in Word &lsquo;95 and &lsquo;97, so distributing the Word/RTF version was no problem. The magazine is now compiled in Adobe Pagemaker, which does not produce those types of files. I apologize for this, but those of you who use MS Word know that it can be a difficult program at the best of times, and I&rsquo;ve run out of patience with it.<br/><br/>I want to give a special thanks to the people who have been so instrumental and encouraging during these last few months, and who helped so much with this issue.

Players then pick through their surviving commoners and choose the character for further adventuring. One way to look at the funnel is to imagine players starting out as the angry mob seen in old horror films &ndash; the band of commoners armed with torches and pitchforks that storm the evil overlord&rsquo;s castle. The funnel answers what happens to those commoners when they breach the gates; it also asks what happens afterwards. Do the survivors go back to their hovels to continue a life of ignominious drudgery, or does their brush with death and horror awaken their courage and a sudden desire for adventure?<br/><br/>So why create a supplement for the funnel? While the Occupation Table in DCC provides a number of interesting occupations, there is always room for more variety. When my players roll on the table, they want to generate a large number of different and interesting occupations. Also, while our players don&rsquo;t necessarily mind randomly determining their occupation, some of them grumble about randomly being elves, dwarves, or halflings. Others question why their cheesemonger will become a wizard or their squire a rogue.<br/><br/>With these issues in mind, I created several Occupation Tables that players use when starting a funnel. The first is the Default Table that lists all of the occupations from Dungeon Crawl Classics plus new occupations as well as the associated race. Like the original Occupation Table, this table randomly determines both a character&rsquo;s starting occupation and race. I strongly encourage the use of this table. For groups that want a more focused funnel, I also created separate tables based on Race and Class.<br/><br/>Also included in Alternate Occupations is a limited list of occupation definitions. This list provides a brief description of certain occupations whose true function may not be obvious or well known to both the players and the judge; for example, I had no clue what a beadle was!<br/><br/>"}, "128575": {"rpgartist": ["Arthur Rackham"], "rpg": ["Fate of the Norns (Original FOTN)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Fate of the Norns (2nd Edition)", "rpgdesigner": ["Andrew Valkauskas"], "rpgproducer": ["Andrew Valkauskas"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1380664.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": ["FOTN 2e"], "average": "10", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Low Fantasy)", "History (Britain / Ireland)", "History (Europe)", "History (Medieval)", "History (Vikings)", "Politics / Government"], "rpgpublisher": ["Pendelhaven"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1380664_t.jpg", "description": "Author's Note:<br/><br/>Fate of the Norns 2e is the second edition of the popular Fate of the Norns franchise.

If you're comfortable with the Shatnerian school of acting, can spontaneously hum snippets of the original soundtrack during appropriate scenes and have no problem with outrageous accents, this is the place for you.<br/><br/>The goal of this game is to create something relatively quick and dirty, simple to set up and fast to run, using the d20 Modern system for accessibility and to allow access to the vast amount of pregenerated d20 content. Hopefully, it strikes a balance between camp and grit: while much of this game is pretty silly, much of it isn't.

A Living Forgotten Realms adapted adventure set near the Evermoors for Adventure Level 12 (character levels 11-15).<br/><br/>This adventure is found in Issue 197 of Dungeon online, part of D&amp;D Insider. Dungeon issues may be found on the Wizards of the Coast website (<a target='_blank' href='http://wizards.com/dnd' rel='nofollow'>http://wizards.com/dnd</a>). At least one person at the table (either a player or the DM) must have an active subscription to D&amp;D Insider. This is the first part of the Against the Giants Major Quest. The other parts are ADAP4-4 Warrens of the Stone Giant Thane, ADAP4-5 Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl, and ADAP4-6 Halls of the Fire Giant King. You should play the parts in order. This is a very long adventure. We recommend that you allow at least fourteen hours of playing time.<br/><br/>This adaptation document does not present adjusted stat blocks for low/high tier; any LFR-legal AL 12 table can play, but bear in mind that the stat blocks in the adventure were written for a party of level 12-14 characters. Tables consisting entirely of brand- new 11th-level characters might find this adventure difficult; a table of all 15th-level characters might find it easy. The DM is encouraged to make adjustments as needed to ensure a fun time for the players and a challenging but fair experience for the PCs.<br/><br/>"}, "128624": {"statistics": [], "name": "Cracoviana", "playingtime": "40", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Poland"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1779444_t.jpg", "average": "0", "boardgamepublisher": ["Polskie Gry Planszowe (Polish Board Games)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1779444.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Polish First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "40", "poll": [], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "40", "description": "Cracoviana takes you for the walk throgh Cracow old streets, where you find traces of historical events, rulers and artists.

Each house is competing for Influence to gain the favor of Rome. Through a combination of political schemes and glorious battles on the arena sands your house will rise in fame and stature. As Dominus, you have a variety of resources at your disposal. Guards protect you from schemes launched by rivals. Slaves run your household and earn gold. Gladiators compete to bring glory to themselves and influence to their Dominus.<br/><br/>Three main phases occur in each game round of Spartacus: A Game of Blood &amp; Treachery.<br/><br/>The Intrigue Phase is when players launch their Schemes, hoping to raise their fortunes while undermining their rivals.  Schemes and Reactions are represented by cards in the Intrigue Deck. Players wield their Influence to put their Schemes into play, often asking for (or bribing) another player&rsquo;s help in hatching the most complex plots.<br/><br/>The Market Phase is when players buy, sell and trade Assets (Gladiators, Slaves, Equipment and Guards). Players also bid against each other to acquire new Assets at Auction. Wealth is not the only path to success as players bluff and bargain with each other to acquire the Assets they covet.<br/><br/>The Arena Phase is when the bloody games are held. Gladiators from two rival Houses are pitted against each other in a brutal fight for glory. The spectacles of the games are represented by miniature combat on the arena board. Fighters pit their Attack, Defense and Speed dice against one another to determine the victor. All players seek to increase their fortunes by betting on the outcome of the gruesome conflict. Fighters who emerge from the arena victorious gain Favor and their Dominus gain Influence.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to become the most influential house in Capua, securing your family&rsquo;s power for years to come.  During the game, players will bribe, poison, betray, steal, blackmail, and undermine each other. Gold will change hands again and again to buy support, stay someone&rsquo;s hand or influence their decisions.

The player may establish &quot;guilds&quot; at predetermined positions on the map, and these guilds will support up to five units of the same type in that position. Unit types include crossbowmen, archers, warriors, mages, and more. Strategy and story are driven by the game's for Heroes: Melwyn, Lovell, General, and Elwyn. Only one hero can be taken into battle at a time. The hero is much stronger than a guild, and can provide various bonuses to particular unit types (for instance, Melwyn boosts the effectiveness of mages). Heroes gain experience when a stage is completed, and may allocate skill-points after a level-up. The player also earns credits that may be used to purchase equipment , which is a crucial part of the game design. Heroes may equip several accessories at a time, and loot has complex properties like many RPGs (Diablo etc). At the time of writing, Defender Chronicles II is not &quot;free to play,&quot; but it does rely heavily on in-app purchases to generate revenue. Such purchases can permanently boost end-of-level experience and money, alter the rare-item drop rate, and so on. The developer for DCII maintains  a web community for the game that can be accessed directly from the app itself.<br/><br/>"}, "128719": {"rpgdesigner": ["Rafael Beltrame"], "rpg": ["Pocket Dragon"], "statistics": [], "name": "Pocket Dragon Livro de Monstros", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["Ant\u00f4nio S\u00e1 Neto"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1382180.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PocketMod PDF Version 1.0"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Redbox"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1382180_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Este suplemento, um dos mais pedidos para a linha Pocket do Old Dragon, possui 24 criaturas de variados n&iacute;veis de poder, com estat&iacute;sticas totalmente convertidas para o sistema pocket.<br/><br/>De Goblin a Drag&atilde;o, passando por Orcs e Trolls numa sele&ccedil;&atilde;o cl&aacute;ssica e ao mesmo tempo muito ecl&eacute;tica de desafios para os seus jogadores e como n&atilde;o poderia deixar de ser, tudo numa &uacute;nica folha A4.<br/><br/><br/>Translation courtesy of Google:<br/><br/>This supplement, one of the requests to the line of Old Pocket Dragon has 24 creatures of varying levels of power, with statistics for the system fully converted pocket.<br/><br/>From Goblin Dragon, through Orcs and Trolls in a classic selection while very eclectic challenges for your players and how it could not be all on one A4 sheet.<br/><br/>"}, "128720": {"rpgdesigner": ["Rafael Beltrame"], "rpg": ["Pocket Dragon"], "statistics": [], "name": "Pocket Dragon Wuxia", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["Ant\u00f4nio S\u00e1 Neto"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1382181.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PocketMod PDF Version 1.0"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Martial Arts"], "rpgpublisher": ["Redbox"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1382181_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Wuxia &eacute; um suplemento para Pocket Dragon que busca uma forma simples mas divertida de usar elementos dos fant&aacute;sticos filmes chineses (onde lutas com espadas em pleno ar e poderosos golpes de kung fu s&atilde;o comuns) em sua mesa de RPG.<br/><br/>Usando o sistema Pocket do Old Dragon, &ldquo;Wuxia&rdquo; &eacute; uma adapta&ccedil;&atilde;o aberta do g&ecirc;nero, inspirada em filmes como &ldquo;O Tigre e o Drag&atilde;o&rdquo; e &ldquo;Her&oacute;i&rdquo; e buscando diversificar um pouco o tema do jogo.<br/><br/>Pegue sua Destino Verde ou seu Sabre Drag&atilde;o e entre no mundo dos her&oacute;is errantes de Wuxia!<br/><br/><br/>Translation courtesy of Google:<br/><br/>Wuxia is a supplement to Pocket Dragon seeking a simple but fun to use elements of the fantastic Chinese films (where sword fights in midair and powerful kung fu moves are common) on your desk RPG.<br/><br/>Using the system of the Old Pocket Dragon, &quot;Wuxia&quot; is an open fit the genre, inspired by movies like &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; and &quot;Hero&quot; and seeking to diversify a bit on the theme of the game.<br/><br/>Take your or your Destination Green Dragon Sabre and enter the world of heroes Wuxia wandering!<br/><br/>"}, "128721": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2994857.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Pantelis Bouboulis", "Sotirios Tsantilas"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Anthony Cournoyer", "Viktor Csete", "Chrisi Giannopoulou", "Sami Laakso"], "boardgamepublisher": ["LudiCreations"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2994857_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Industry / Manufacturing", "Political"], "description": "Axia &mdash; a land with a glorious past, a most uncertain present, and an even more unpredictable future.

It's similar to Bullshit in that bluffing plays a key role; however the game is more fast-paced and, arguably, more intense.<br/><br/>While originally intended for two players (which is still the best way to play it), any number of people can play.<br/><br/>The gameplay is simple. A deck of 52 cards is used. The dealer shuffles the deck and places it on the table face down. The player to the left of the dealer is the first to go - he picks up a card from the deck, taking care not to show it to anyone. Now he can either discard it on the table, face up, or declare it a spade and put it in front of him, face down. If the latter happened, any other player can, but is not obliged to, challenge the first player by opening the card. If it's not a spade (i.e. the player attempted bluff), the first player is out of the game; if it is a spade, the second player is out. When only one player is left, he is declared the winner; with two people playing, the winner will always be determined on the first challenge.<br/><br/>The only other way to win is to collect a pre-determined number of spades - seven spades in the two-player version. The last (seventh) spade has to be a real spade, and is put face up, not face down. The person to do this is declared the winner.<br/><br/>Anyone can challenge a person who claims to have a spade, but only immediately after the card is put down. When the next player picks up a card, you are no longer allowed to challenge the previous player. Only the last card a player put down can be challenged, not the other ones.<br/><br/>When more than two people are playing, the number of spades to collect is adjusted so that it's always possible to win without bluffing. With a single 52-card deck, the number of spades to collect is:<br/><br/>for 2 people: 7<br/>for 3 people: 5<br/>for 4 people: 4<br/>for 5 people: 3<br/><br/>To increase the number of spades, or to allow more than five people to play, more than one deck can be used. The number of spades to collect is then multiplied by the number of decks used.<br/><br/>Optionally the following rule can be added when more than two people are playing: if a person challenges another player and proves him a liar, he gets a free turn. This promotes challenging and makes bluffing a bit more expensive.<br/><br/>"}, "128784": {"poll": [], "name": "Pig Tail", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Traditional Card Games"], "average": "5.66667", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Public Domain)"], "boardgameversion": ["Public domain edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Using the standard deck of cards, each player tries to have the fewest number of cards at the end of the game.

The simulation includes 58 pages of rules and procedures, scenarios, counter sheets, and map sections.<br/><br/>There are 16 scenarios beginning with an introductory basic scenario involving one China National Aviation Corporation DC-3 type aircraft flying a pioneering path-finding flight from Assam, India across the Himalayas to Kunming, China.  The second scenario brings in the US Army Air Force using C-47 type aircraft in flying fuel to China for Doolittle's Raiders that they would have used to fly from China to India after the Raid on Tokyo in early 1942.  Scenarios continue chronologically capturing highlights of the airlift campaign and introducing in succession:  C-87, C-46, C-109, and finally C-54 type aircraft.  The final scenario provides for as many as 500 aircraft in a one day maximum effort that occurred on August 1st, 1945 when the Air Transport Command India-China Division made over 1,000 sorties and delivered more than 5,000 tons of cargo to China in a single 24-hour period.  Scenarios provide historical average daily tonnage for comparison of player performance in running airlift operations.<br/><br/>There are four counter sheets on 8-1/2 inch by 11-inch pages with each 1/2-inch by 1/2-inch counter representing a single aircraft with its flight characteristics printed on the counter.  There are eight map pages on 8-1/2 inch by 11-inch pages that can be trimmed to form a map approximately 16 inches by 40 inches with representations of geographic locations, terrain, and altitude bands for flying aircraft counters from India to China and returning for another load.  Various simulation tracks, such as the tonnage delivered, time clock, morale and efficiency, loss rate, and search and rescue level are included on the map sections.  The map also includes loading and turn around boxes at the air fields for tracking aircraft as they land, load or turn around, complete loading or turn-around, are cleared for takeoff, and take off on their next flight.<br/><br/>The simulation is available as a free download and is fully contained in an Adobe Acrobat file that prints out on 58 pages of 8-1/2 by 11-inch paper.  The simulation includes some probability driven aspects of airlift operations, and three or more 10-sided dice can be used for these purposes.  No dice are provided, and players will need to provide dice or other means of generating random numbers.<br/><br/>The simulation is designed for solitaire play.  More than one player can participate by dividing aircraft types among players or dividing operating bases among players.<br/><br/>"}, "128817": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1389866.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["\u30b7\u30e7\u30fc\u30ca\u30f3 (Shownan)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["\u30b7\u30e7\u30fc\u30ca\u30f3 (Shownan)"], "boardgamepublisher": ["ShownanRocketiaz"], "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1389866_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "description": "In the distant future, Penguins dominate the earth in the east and west, fighting for the supremacy of the earth.<br/><br/>Play is a game for two players divided into attacker and defender.<br/><br/>Players are divided into military forces and King penguins Emperor penguins.<br/><br/>Against the attacking card, do the defense.<br/>A successful attack, you'll earn points according to the card walls.<br/>Defense side, you can return fire so as not to give point to the attacker.<br/><br/>Place the card in the middle of the field three walls.<br/><br/>Player, published from a select My first card of each other.

With this game, you should be able to re-create a match of soccer complete with all the decisions that the coach would make.  You decide who to dress and who to scratch.  You decide who to start and who to save as a substitute.  You name the starting keeper.  There are also plenty of &lsquo;in game&rsquo; decisions to make.  Do I take a shot from the scoring zone, or try to penetrate for a better scoring chance.  If the game is tied late in the second half, do I play conservative, or do I play aggressive and go for the win?  My star midfielder just collapsed due to heat exhaustion.  How do I replace his offense?  How do I replace his defense?  Once you have a solid understanding of the cards, charts, and gameplay, you should be able to play a full regulation match in about thirty minutes.<br/>     <br/>The game is played using three ten sided dice and player cards that represent their abilities on the pitch.

The aim of the game is supporting your clan with military advantage; the clan which has the most troops at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game each player gets a clan card which shows what clan the player will belong to and four troop cards from the deck. The area before the player (his table) presents one of Japan&rsquo;s provinces, so the more players the more provinces. The players take turns clockwise from the starting player. Each player&rsquo;s turn consists of the following orders: the troop deployment order, the troop movement order and the attacking order. During his turn the player must place a card from his hand on any province except his own one. If by the end of his turn in his province he raised the army (some troops of the same clan) which is stronger (more numerous) than any other army in any other province, the battle is unavoidable. It will be impossible to stop the warlike samurais from attacking but there is an opportunity to direct them to the proper side.  Once there are no more cards in the deck players take a final turn and come in true colors (reveal their secret cards). Clan cards are summed up and the player with the most cards of his clan in all the provinces wins the game.<br/><br/>What&rsquo;s feudal Japan without ninjas! Without them no game about Japan can be complete. The ninjas&rsquo; function is obvious &ndash; to shorten the number of warriors from the enemy clans.<br/><br/>From 3 to 5 players can take part in the game. The tactics of the game changes depending on the number of players. You will need careful calculation to win in a five-player game; fans of bluff and &quot;psychological&quot; game will like the game with three participants.

You can either pick one of the set starting teams or draft your team. Drafting allows you to put almost countless sets of heroes together to try out all sorts of crazy combos and synergies. Drafting works almost like a mini-game before the main event, as the players try to put their best possible team together. Once you have picked your team, it's time to fight.

The first player to turn over all their animal cards, wins.<br/><br/>Note that the box is an extending box.

As the pinnacle of culture and technology, the six Great Houses and four territorial states of the League reaped the benefits of universal peace and justice, the fruits of their combined efforts enriching the lives of billions across the heavens.<br/><br/>...Or so the legends claim.<br/><br/>In reality, the Inner Sphere of the 2750s was far from serene and light-years away from just. Though admired for its monolithic power, the pinnacle of mankind's greatest experiment - the Star League - stood at a fateful crossroads, with feuding House Lords and rebellious territories only waiting for every chance to strike against each other.<br/><br/>Era Report: 2750 pierces the luminous veneer of what many Inner Sphere and Clan historians alike have considered to be the golden age of BattleTech history: the height of the Star League era. Presented as a general overview of the period, rather than a focused report on a single conflict, this book includes descriptions of every major Inner Sphere faction active before the fateful events described in Historical: Liberation of Terra. Notable personalities, military forces and an overview of the technological capabilities of the Star League age are also provided, along with special advanced-level rules for campaigns set during the time, whether played using the Total Warfare core rules or those found in A Time of War: The BattleTech Role-Playing Game.<br/><br/>"}, "128998": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Chris Harding (I)"], "average": "4.5", "poll": [], "name": "The Road to St. Die", "playingtime": "240", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1388024_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Faura", "Chris Harding (I)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Chris Harding Simulations"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1388024.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": ["World War II"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "240", "description": "The Road to St Die is a company/battalion level simulation of those battles in October 1944.<br/><br/>Players control the various German and American forces which took part.
