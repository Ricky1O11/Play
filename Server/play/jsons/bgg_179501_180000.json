He loved sweets so much that he wanted to eat the best sweet in the heaven, and to do that he climbed up a ladder made from shrimp. Just at the moment he reached heaven, the god of thunder met him while patrolling. The god of thunder was pissed because no mortal human was allowed to intrude the sacred heaven. A flash and thunder hit poor Sweet Nose, who fell from the ladder like a meteor and dissolved into a pile of black powder when he hit the ground, transforming into tiny insects &mdash; the ants.<br/><br/>To avoid being hit by thunder and becoming the successor of the Sweet Nose legend, you had better not eat too many sweets. This doesn't mean you can't enjoy those delicious sweets in the city &mdash; but if you enter specific stores on the street, you might need to run from the thunder of heaven...<br/><br/>Sweet Nose is a game of exciting interaction. You try to eat the most types of candy by trading with others, but the sweetness of each candy differs for each player, so to keep yourself from being the one who eats too many sweets, you need to be careful when trading and observe the reaction of other players. What's more, different shops provide different surprises, so you also need to take those shops' candies into consideration. On a turn, you can do one of the following actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Trade with friend: Trade one of your candies with another player, with each player placing the candy they receive on their mouth board.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Trade with market: Trade one of your candies with the market in the middle of table, placing your candy in the market and one of the market candies on your trading dish board.<br/><br/><br/>In the end, whoever eats the most sweets loses, and the winner is the one who eats the fewest sweets.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["English/Chinese first edition"], "name": "Sweet Nose", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Secret Unit Deployment", "Set Collection", "Trading"], "average": "6.66607", "usersrated": "56", "age": "8", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["HLG 11: Stilte voor de Storm"]}, "179549": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Dave De Beukelaer"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Divine Empire", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1997", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2562335_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Ken Broeders", "Werner Claessens"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["F.P.O.

The game encourages the use of &quot;deductive and abductive reasoning&quot; to assist in reducing the suspect list from 37 to 10 prime suspects, to ultimately identify the only possible killer. The objective of the game has two parts, concerned with discovering the identity of the culprit and having the incriminating evidence to hand!<br/><br/>The game has 3 play formats - OPENplay (2-6), COVERTplay (2-5) or SOLOplay - and has Career, Group and Co-Op variants that provide ample choice in the way the game is played.<br/><br/>The game set comes complete with; 5 Evidence Packs (labelled, ABCDE) a total of 300 cards; &quot;How to be a Deadcert Detective Guide&quot;; a Detective Checklist Pad (with 30 double sided sheets) and 25 Evidence Bags. Each Evidence Pack contains 3 &quot;evidence types&quot; - Victim; Crime Scene and Time of Death - that are used to define murder cases and provide details of the suspects. When the game set is initially opened, the Evidence Packs are each split into 3 Evidence type Packets and kept securely in their individual evidence bags. This will use 15 of 25 bags provided - more about the remaining bags later...<br/><br/>At the start of a game - or &quot;murder episode&quot; as it is referred to - one of each type of Evidence Packet is selected in order to define the murder mystery to be solved. With 5 Evidence Packs this means there are 5x5x5=125 possible episodes that can be played out. With the crime defined, the 18 suspect cards for each evidence type are shuffled together to form the 54 cards in play. 48 of the cards hold information about the suspects - why they had motive, means or the opportunity to carry out the murder. The other 6 are the Snoop cards which play a slightly different role depending on the format being played, but in essence are used to mix up the game play and enable the transfer of suspect evidence between players (or detectives if you wish to fully embrace the experience).<br/><br/>So what about the extra 10 evidence bags? Well 1 is a genuine spare, the other 9 however (and the extra compartment with the game set tray) enable you to safely store up to 3 expansion packs (labelled, FGH) sold separately. These Expansion Packs provide extra victims, crime scenes and times of death to the London mix and interlink with the existing packs. Not only do they increase the number of murder episodes possible, they do so exponentially. If all 3 Expansion Packs are added, 125 episodes expand to a potential 512.<br/><br/>The structure of the game is unique, and is the first of it's kind to provide multiple realistic crime mysteries with a pure card game format - no solution book is required, the murderer is simply the only suspect to have had motive, means and opportunity.<br/><br/>Unlike many card games, it does not lean heavily on the graphics. This, although potentially unpopular with many, is a deliberate move to help focus on the evidence, the textual content of the suspect cards. Font sizing, colouring and new sentences starting on new lines, has all been done to make the reading of the cards as comfortable as possible, to the widest audience as possible. Graphics play an important role in distinguishing the 3 card types, but that is their key role.<br/><br/>The final aspect of the game, that is only set to emerge after playing a few episodes, is the detail and integrity of all the characters that are woven together through the multiple storylines. Any information gathered about a victim or suspect may come in use in future investigations and nothing learnt will be contradicted later by another card. In short, the interwoven stories, events and relationships have as much integrity as the knowledge that you have identified the killer correctly.

The game is to be played by 2 - 6 players and each round can take up to twenty minutes. The object of the game is to be the first player to get a Flush, thus winning the round.<br/><br/>So the story goes, after the death of the Jabberwocky the residents of Wonderland had a lot of stress off their shoulders. The game was created by the Mad Hatter to give people something to do with their newly found recreational time. With this new lack of stress, they needed something to help become stressful again, this was the answer to that dilemma. After Alice's Adventure Underground, the Hatter decided to create the game using Aluette designs, that consists of no queen cards nor the suit of hearts. He thought this best since everyone was still getting over the events, but did like the idea of the added stress. Initially the game was designed for three rounds, but that did not deem stressful enough and has been increased to five rounds. The winner of the round is simply the first to get a Flush (cards with all matching suits), the player with the most wins in the five rounds--keeps the deck. Only one deck exists in Wonderland so this was the best way to ensure everyone could own a copy.<br/><br/>While Lewis Carroll may not have conceptualized this game in his works, we have taken it upon ourselves to do so. The majority of the cards in the game are traditional Poker Cards, the Action Cards include imagery from the original book and the artwork in the game is originally by Arthur Rackham.<br/><br/>How to Play<br/><br/>1. Cards are shuffled and scattered in a pool in the middle of the Tabletop.<br/>2. Each player grabs five cards from the pool.<br/>3. During their turn a player may use a Wonder Card or Discard a Card, then draw again from the pool.<br/>4.

Countries around the world will panic, widespread chaos will ensue, and civilized society will change virtually overnight as citizens cope with the loss of a modern-day vital resource. A resource needed for commerce. A resource needed for communication. A resource needed for life-sustaining technology. A resource needed for even simple comfort. The resource&hellip; is energy.<br/><br/>But that time is not here yet! Thankfully, you and a handful of other enterprising individuals have seen the writing on the wall, and you know it is up to you to save the world from the upcoming energy crisis! Of course, the recent United Nations Contract request for a global energy provider worth BILLIONS of dollars doesn&rsquo;t hurt, either&hellip;<br/><br/>Compete with other players to win the contract and ensure that your company will become the #1 global energy power for decades to come! Obtain government industry permits by using energy credits allotted by the United Nations Council for aligning yourself to their objectives. Industries you own constantly increase the energy credits you are allotted, but they also increase the terawatt-hours (energy) generated by your company! And it is ultimately out-performing your opponents in this area and hitting the optimal level of terawatt-hours that will win you the U.N. contract, and win you the game!<br/><br/><br/>Each player must make optimum use of their resources and the available hexagonal areas on the board to not only achieve a victory with generating enough terawatt-hours (TWh), but must also generate more TWh than their fellow players. In every round of play, each player will take a single turn. During this turn, you will draw a card, be &ldquo;paid&rdquo; in energy credits, allowed to roll the territory die, and either permit industries or take an investment beforehand. If you ever wish to end your turn early, you may draw another grid card. This will end your turn without taking further action. Your choices in actions determine your odds of victory here!<br/><br/>When drawing a grid card, keep it secret, as it can be your secret weapon against your fellow players! Place them face-down in front of you to play later, or play them immediately.<br/><br/>Because you get paid every turn, try to maximize your energy credit return early on in the game so that you can permit multiple, higher TWh industries quicker by amassing enough energy credits. Of course, as you&rsquo;ll see when you play the game, this plan can be easier said than done!<br/><br/>For an added twist, each player has a unique and special ability with which they can use during the course of the game. This ability is granted by the Captain of Industry card each player selected at the beginning of the game. Use your ability to your advantage and out-maneuver your opponents! Only one player can win the United Nations Contract!<br/><br/>And if you optionally play with the countdown die, you&rsquo;ll not only be racing other players, but racing time as well&hellip; This also makes solo play possible!<br/><br/>When a player reaches the TWh threshold, the current round of play is finished, and the player generating the most TWh wins Game of Energy!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "8.03846", "name": "Game of Energy", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Simulation", "Tile Placement", "Variable Phase Order"], "age": "14", "usersrated": "13", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["1P 107 - Samurai Spirit"]}, "179616": {"poll": [], "name": "Planeteer", "playingtime": "150", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Co-operative Play", "Modular Board", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unpublished)"], "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "150", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Dice", "Exploration", "Science Fiction"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "Planeteer is a unique dice allocation and tile laying game set in a retro science fiction universe. Each player takes on the role of a freelance space exploration agency. Throughout the game they will be hiring personel (known as Planeteers), exploring planetoids, encountering aliens, and completing objectives based on scenarios.<br/><br/>The game begins by drawing a random 4&quot;x4&quot; starting tile. This tile will set the scenario for the current game, whether it be a crashed starship of colonists that need rescuing, an alien hive that must be destroyed, or a cache of rare space minerals that can be mined and exploited. Players will then take turns laying down tiles to create a 5x5 grid that will serves as the planet's surface.<br/><br/>The game is divided into two phases: The Preparation Phase, and the Action Phase. During the Prep Phase, players will allocate dice to different tasks, such as acquiring components to build rovers to explore the planet surface, building and deploying rovers, researching technology, or recruiting more Planeteers (represented by 6-sided dice). Players have a maximum number of Planeteer Interaction Points (or pips) that can be allocated amongst their available Planeteers. Once players have taken their actions in the Prep Phase, any remaining Planeteers go to the Flight Deck, and will become the Pilots for the rovers during the Action Phase.<br/><br/>During the Action Phase, players will assign their Pilots to any rovers they have on the planet's surface. These vehicles can perform tasks such as moving around the planet, interacting with objects (like salvaging or mining for minerals), or attacking (other players or aliens). Each scenario has a certain objective to complete, and the player who does so most efficiently wins the game.<br/><br/>One of the most unique aspects of Planeteer are the rovers. Rovers are built by stacking components (cardboard chits). Each stack has a hole in the middle to fit a die (the pilot). The die face will show how many actions are available for that rover. Actions are dependent on the components equipped. Each component stacks so that it's available actions (icons) don't overlap, so any icon showing is an action available for that rover.<br/><br/>"}, "179617": {"rpgartist": ["Nick Russell"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "statistics": [], "name": "Mythic Paths of the Lost Spheres: Godhunter", "rpgdesigner": ["Christen N.

Each turn, you roll a die and extend your wall of stones by that number. When you place stones, you place the first one on a square adjacent to any one of your stones, then place each of the remaining stones adjacent to the stone you placed last. If that square, or the line of squares beyond, are occupied by opponents' stones, instead you skip these squares and place your stone on the nearest empty square beyond them. In this case, you pick up all the stones skipped over and gain victory points. But beware. When you pick up opponents' stones, you leave a gap between your walls, which is vulnerable to their counter-attack.<br/><br/>At the center of the board, there are large obstacles you can use as your defense, and bonus stones which can be scored like opponents' stones.<br/><br/>A game consists of rounds equal to the number of players, and a round ends when three minutes of real time have passed. Everything on the gameboard is held over to the next rounds, with an exception at the beginning of the final round, when the stones on four corners are removed from the board, allowing the potential of big points.<br/><br/>At the end of the final round, the player who has picked up the most stones wins the game.<br/><br/>This game comes with a sandglass to keep track of time, and an original music CD which goes well with the atomosphere of the game.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>\u53e4\u4ee3\u30a8\u30b8\u30d7\u30c8 \u304c\u821e\u53f0\u3002\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u3068\u5965\u6df1\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6027\u304c\u7279\u5fb4\u306e\u7802\u6642\u8a08\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u65b0\u611f\u899a\u306e\u77f3\u53d6\u308a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3002\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u97f3\u697dCD\u3082\u4ed8\u3044\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u97f3\u697d\u3068\u3068\u3082\u306b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u3001\u4e94\u611f\u306e\u904a\u622f\u3002\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u5185\u5bb9\u306f\u6642\u8a08\u56de\u308a\u306b\u30b5\u30a4\u30b3\u30ed\u3092\u632f\u3063\u3066\u51fa\u305f\u76ee\u306e\u6570\u3060\u3051\u6301\u3061\u77f3\u3092\u76e4\u4e0a\u306b\u7f6e\u304d\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u77f3\u3092\u631f\u3093\u3067\u53d6\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u7802\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u7802\u304c\u3059\u3079\u3066\u843d\u3061\u304d\u308b\u6642\u9593\uff083\u5206\u9593\uff09\u30921\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u3068\u3057\u3001\u898f\u5b9a\u306e\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u6570\uff082\u4eba\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u5834\u5408\uff1d2\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u30013\u4eba\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u5834\u5408\uff1d3\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u30014\u4eba\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u5834\u5408\uff1d4\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\uff09\u304c\u7d42\u4e86\u3059\u308b\u307e\u3067\u306b\u77f3\u3092\u4e00\u756a\u591a\u304f\u53d6\u3063\u305f\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u52dd\u3061\u3067\u3059\u3002<br/><br/>(Using Google Translate on the above Kanji text gives us:  &quot;Ancient Egypt stage.

Pirates needed fast ships, strong enough to withstand a barrage of cannon fire. Tradeoffs between strength and speed, often times, weighed heavily in the outcome of battles. In the quest for riches, pirates would seek to plunder hidden treasures and the ill-gotten gains of other captains. Treachery, betrayal, and danger beset even the most cunning captain. Do you have what it takes to command your ship and pillage enough doubloons to claim victory?<br/><br/>Scourge of the Seven Seas is a competitive or cooperative game for one to six players, each commanding a pirate ship on the high seas. Captains travel in search of hidden treasure and ship upgrades while fending off attacks and bribery attempts. The first captain to claim twenty points of treasure wins!<br/><br/>The object of Scourge of the Seven Seas is to be the first player to deliver twenty points or more of treasure to their home port. You score points by taking turns moving your pawn between home port and an island full of buried treasures. At the start of the game you are dealt five cards which you use to determine the initial speed and strength of your ship.<br/><br/>On your turn you may search for treasure, deliver treasure to your home port, draw cards at a trade port, attack other ships, or attempt to bribe dock workers. As the game progresses, players may visit trading ports to draw additional cards to increase their ship stats. You can attack other player&rsquo;s ships to plunder their riches or discard cards to bribe disloyal dock workers and steal the treasures at their home port. Attacking can be risky as you might become the victim; whereas sneaking into a home port and bribing would best be done with a fast ship for your escape.<br/><br/>There are many different strategies to win competitively. The goal in team or single player mode is for at least one player to gain twenty or more points of treasure before Davy Jones releases the Kraken. Each player chooses a ship from a fleet of six different ships (Galleon, Frigate, Man O&rsquo; War, Schooner, Corvette, or Sloop) with varying abilities. In cooperative mode, you and your team must do battle with Davy Jones as he tries to block you from delivering treasures.  All the while, a doom clock counts down to Davy Jones becoming strong enough to release the Kraken on your team.<br/><br/>"}, "179656": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2563586.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ignacy Trzewiczek", "Merry Trzewiczek"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "7", "boardgameartist": ["Mark Bulahao", "Lucas Ribeiro"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Portal Games"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2563586_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Exploration", "Murder/Mystery"], "description": "Bored after guessing your suspect?

In Westeros, the death of Robert Baratheon has created a power vacuum with rival Houses competing for control of The Iron Throne. Meanwhile, in Essos, Daenerys Targaryen is building an army to contest the rule of the Ghiscari slavers, before returning to reclaim The Iron Throne.

There are minor thematic variations to suit the new map. The winner is determined by which player controls the most territories, castles and ports when the end game card is revealed.<br/><br/>Dominion rules add the additional mechanics and cards described above. Instead of simply trying to control the most territories, castles, and ports you are now trying to achieve specific Objectives to earn Victory Points, furthering your efforts to consolidate power and establish dominion over the rival Houses. Objectives are worth from 1 to 4 Victory Points, based on the difficulty to achieve them.

Each month you will take part in engagements against a random number of Soviet squads and accumulate victory points which facilitate promotion, unit upgrades and awards.  Single, tournament style engagements or one of two campaigns may be played.  Designed from the ground up as a solitaire system, the game's brain is an innovative hex template that is used for unit placement.  This primary system works in concert with a proven chit pull sub-system and action charts which dictate if an enemy unit moves (if so what direction) fires, or does nothing. The map is framed by a slew of information which you must keep track of including: squad action points, leader action points, sudden death track, sniper track, month track, weather, initial German deployment, expected level of enemy resistance, engagement type (three possible types), arty/air strikes, and a victory point track.  The map is a generic, base map upon which terrain tiles are configured according to the given scenarios or simply your own whim! Combat is comprised of a combat results table that determines the number of step losses and subsequent pinned, suppressed or broken results.  Or, you may chuck the primary combat engine for an alternative &quot;buckets&quot; of dice combat engine!  Close combat is brutal and there are no guarantees in this game.

At the height of World War II, spies from around the world descended on Berlin, Germany to gain intelligence on military operations. Allied forces from countries including United States, England, and Russia engaged in dangerous clandestine operations, code breaking, and subterfuge. The secrets they obtained thwarted military advancements into Western and Eastern Europe. Now, you, the agent behind enemy lines in Berlin in the early 1940s, seek to decipher the enemy plans, avoid being caught by the Schutzstaffel, and uncover the double agent among your peers.<br/><br/>Gameplay. Operation Berlin is a mystery board game with a defector. The goal is to determine which military operation Nazi Germany is planning through process of elimination. Players move as spies through Berlin obtaining information and avoiding hindrances in the form of roadblocks, security guards, and Schutzstaffel. As an added challenge, players may be double agents trying to prevent the other agents from discovering the German plans. This game combines the mystery style of Clue with the player interaction of Resistance to create a unique and intriguing replaying of history.<br/><br/>Mystery Element: There are 9 possible missions characterized by the country of attack and type of attack. One of the missions is selected at random, unknown to the players, and placed aside as the actual secret mission. A tracking sheet assists players in eliminating possible missions when they find or trade information on what cards are not in the secret mission pile. First player to accurately guess the secret mission wins!<br/><br/>Defector: Based on the number of players there may be 1 or 2 double agents. By randomly drawing the agent and double agents cards at the beginning, no one knows what side the other players are on. This adds a covert element that will have players interacting, accusing, and defending until the truth is known. Double agents may choose at any point in the game to reveal their secret, allowing them to play as the German forces. If the double agent remains incognito, all players may accuse a person of being a double agent and force them to be uncovered. But if they guess wrong the game ends in a German victory!<br/><br/>"}, "179790": {"rpgdesigner": ["Ryan Macklin"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing"], "statistics": [], "name": "Backstory Cards", "rpgartist": ["Daniel Solis"], "rpgproducer": ["Tim Rodriguez", "Amanda Valentine"], "average": "9.33333", "usersrated": "3", "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgpublisher": ["Brooklyn Indie Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "description": "Backstory Cards<br/><br/>[ Taken from the back of the card box. ]<br/><br/>Create rich worlds for your roleplaying games'<br/><br/>Backstory Cards is a deck of prompts that meshes your characters and settings together, creating unexpected history and engaging plot hooks.

Depending on the value rolled he must then place that die on a placement card that is less than or equal to that value. Since there can only be one die per placement there is a possibility that he will be unable to place his die due to another player being there or that space being patrolled by a guard, if that is the case he will temporarily lose that die.<br/><br/>Step 2: Take Action on Placement Card<br/><br/>After landing on a placement card the player then takes the action associated with that card. Some placements will allow you to collect materials while others let you steal from other players.<br/><br/>Step 3: Use Material Cards to Craft Items<br/><br/>Anytime during a players turn they may take two material cards to create a crafted item. Each crafted item has a special ability which helps throughout the game. Some crafted items will alter dice rolls while others make it easier to escape.<br/><br/>Step 4: Gather the Items for an Escape Plan<br/><br/>There will be a handful of escape plans that are available for everyone to utilize. Use the escape plans available as a guide on what combination of crafted items you should be creating. Once you have collected the required items needed (2-4 depending on the type of escape plan) you can execute that escape.<br/><br/>Step 5: Execute an Escape Plan<br/><br/>In order to successfully escape the player must draw the required success cards needed (Depending on the type of escape plan) one by one. This number is indicated on the escape plan. You may back out at any time but if you fail then you will lose all the items you used during that attempt.<br/><br/>Step 6: Escape with Two Prisoners<br/><br/>The first player to escape with two prisoners wins the game<br/><br/>"}, "179877": {"rpgdesigner": ["J.

In this newest installment of the series we look to a number of historical and fantastical sources to expand the flavor and flexibility of the witch base class. The following is just a small taste of what is inside of Into the Breach: the Witch.<br/><br/>Bailiwick Hermit<br/>Due to historic persecution and superstition some witches eschew the comforts of even a thorp and instead live on the outskirts of society. The hostile lands they typically call home are a source of both power and imprisonment as the increasingly become dependent on the land they protect. Villages nearby often refer to bailiwick hermits as witches of the wood or swamp witches. Such villagers only trespass when times are dire and a desperate request to such a being is the last resort.<br/><br/>Bog Builder archetype<br/>All alone on the outskirts of civilization, some witches turn to their own creations for companionship. A bog builder crafts a construct from natural materials at hand and her patron imbues it with semi-life.<br/><br/>Bulwark Theurgist archetype<br/>Bulwark Theurgists devote themselves to a ward they believe serves the greater good. Be it a noble, hero, peasant, or any intelligent creature the bulwark theurgist acts as a guardian angel to their wards. These devoted protectors are particularly skilled at thwarting fell magics.<br/><br/>Disciple of the Bloody Hand archetype<br/>While most witches have a familiar invested with the power of their patrons, a disciple of the bloody hand is a witch that invests her patron&rsquo;s power into her own hand, granting it the ability to move on its own and channel her power.<br/><br/>Dweomer Weaver archetype<br/>There is myth and wonder in the art of weaving, as cloth lets man settle where nature is harsh. The loom, spindle, and distaff are more than tools to some however; they are symbols of power and fate. Long have these secrets been known to womankind, the greatest secret being that some women may create far more than mundane cloth from their efforts.<br/><br/>Feybound Crone archetype<br/>Some witches commune with entities that are known but surrounded by an air of mystery and otherworldly thoughts. The feybound crone seeks out those from the First World, the mysterious fey, as her patrons.<br/><br/>Foul Temptress archetype<br/>The thrill of the hunt and the sweet taste of her victims drives the foul temptress to use her powers of seduction to abuse her natural or magically altered beauty and use it as a tool to get what she wants. The foul temptress uses soft words and beguiling suggestion to lower the defenses of her prey before striking, seeking to gain information, poison a mark, convince the weak willed to change their minds, or to end her victim&rsquo;s life.<br/><br/>Gluttonous Crone archetype<br/>The gluttonous crone is motivated by a single, simple emotion; hunger. Her hunger, if not satiated, drives her to insanity and so she must constantly feed or feast upon those ensnared by her wicked powers.<br/><br/>Marjara Bound archetype (marjara is the Sanskrit word for cat)<br/>Among the common folk it is often spoken that a black cat crossing your path is ill luck. Many laugh at this, seeing only superstition. However this caution is not without merit, as there truly are witches for whom a black cat is not just appearance, it is power and it is sacred.<br/><br/>Scorned Heart archetype<br/>Those seeking redress after being spurned travel to the forgotten places of the world to make oaths of revenge. There, dark beings of ancient power offer a pact that grants them the ability to wreak the vengeance they seek.<br/><br/>Voodoo Crafter archetype<br/>Whittlings and sticky resins adorn the wrists of calloused and gnarled hands. Whittling knives, hand planers, and brushes for glues flash their presence every once in a while. Curiously familiar baubles and dolls give off an unsettling feeling as she talks to her gris-gris. Crafting and cursing are the voodoo crafter&rsquo;s tools for every situation.<br/><br/>S&egrave;vit&egrave; Alternate Class<br/>The s&egrave;vit&egrave; is a worshiper of a distant, uninvolved creator god, Bondye. Bondye does not intercede on behalf of mortals so his worshipers request aid and intercession from his servant spirits, the loa. S&egrave;vit&egrave; can be translated as &ldquo;servant of the spirits.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Heathen Prestige Class<br/>Witches in a general sense are misunderstood. They typically have a link to the natural world through a patron of benevolent mien. The minority are truly evil, either tied to a patron of malevolent intent or choose to use their power in a way not necessarily in line with their patron. A rare few are beyond evil in a simple self-serving or hateful way; they study evil, toting tomes of forbidden ancient lore. These are called heathen, and are intentionally anathema to everything good people hold dear. They revel in bloodletting and destruction. They gain power from the sacrifice of innocents. Their souls are promised to evil patrons of the worst kind. For all this they have unmatched power.<br/><br/>Scarred Shaman Prestige Class<br/>In most cultures scars are a sign of past injury and wounds. In others, the scar could be a decoration, a symbol, or a branding, carefully placed there by a shaman or artist. Some of these shaman love the art of scarification so much that they fight in the front lines of battles to magically scar their enemies, but instead of giving scars of honor they place brands of shame. Often going into a rage doing this, they are vicious to their enemies and a great help to the allies they previously placed their mark on. Those who are branded on the battlefield find the scars to be disfiguring or embarrassing, and the lucky few who survive the battle are always reminded of their cowardice.<br/><br/>Off of the battlefield they are masters of the art. In the tribes they can be found in scars tell much about the individual who wears them. For warriors it can tell of their victories and accomplishments. For leaders the right scars can be a symbol of wisdom and honor. Other scars show who is ready to settle down and start a family, or be brands of past crimes as a warning to merchants. For those who know how to read the scars, it is the scarred shaman that they respect and fear the most, because once they have placed a scar they have power over that individual.<br/><br/>New Hexes<br/>Alter Fate, Babble, Boils, Boneless Form, Curse of Twisted Beauty, Death Sigh, Gain Council, Healing Earth, Lesser Hedge Talisman, Unnerving Vision, Wicker Ward.<br/><br/>New Major Hexes<br/>Body Swap, Curse of Baleful Irony, Curse of Dust and Ashes, Heart's Desire, Hedge Talisman, Karmic Fate, Negate Scrying, Scent, Spirit Walk, Uncontrollable Retching.<br/><br/>New Grand Hexes<br/>Alter the Land, Grand Hedge Talisman, Heartless, Karmic Justice, Witch Royalty<br/><br/>New Patrons<br/>Karma, Savage, Royalty, Unnatural.<br/><br/>And seven new witch themed and friendly feats!<br/><br/>"}, "179889": {"rpgdesigner": ["Dylan Brooks", "Frank Gori", "Kiel Howell", "Taylor Hubler", "Mikko Kallio", "Jacob W.

MPoS takes the core mechanic in an entirely new direction by introducing exploration and trade in a multi-player science fiction setting. Location (world) cards are variable and hidden at setup and revealed only when explored. This is not only thematic, but creates infinite replayability and solves the dominant strategy issues (ex. Halifax's Hammer) that can plague low luck games with a static setup.

There were many pots containing many kinds of items. His boss gave orders to sort the pots, but Afumed lost the tags on them. Before the boss comes back, he must sort all the pots.<br/><br/>In The Arabian Pots, you try to sort the pots by listening to the sounds they make when you shake them. The game includes three groups of three pots, with each group making a different sound when you shake it, as well as one pot that makes no sound.<br/><br/>For the basic game, your goal is to create a row of three pots that make the same sound. To set up, set aside the quiet pot, then place the other nine pots at random in the 3x3 grid of the game board. While all other players look away from the board, the first player swaps pairs of pots three times, not shaking them in the process. All of the other players make three swaps in a similar manner, then the game begins. On a turn, a player takes one of two actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Shake one of the pots.<br/>    Swap two pots in the same horizontal or vertical line, without shaking them in the process.<br/><br/><br/>If that player thinks a row contains pots that all have the same sound, yell &quot;Complete!&quot;, then shake the three pots to see whether the guess is correct. If so, the player wins; if not, that player loses their next turn and the game continues.<br/><br/>To use the quiet pot, during set up the first player replaces one of the regular pots with the quiet pot (without shaking anything), then does the pot swaps as usual. If someone shakes the quiet pot during the game, that player must then swap that pot with an adjacent pot while everyone else looks away from the board.<br/><br/>To play The Arabian Pots with people who are blind, announce which pots (1-9) you are shaking or moving. The notch in the game board indicates the bottom of the board.<br/><br/>As an alternate set-up, place the nine noisy pots on the board and the quiet pot to the side. Players then remove one pot at a time from the board, shaking them or not as desired, then place the pots in front of themselves. Place the quiet pot on #5, then take turns placing the pots on the board, leaving the final pot aside unshaken. Then play the game as normal except that whoever shakes the quiet pot must swap it with an adjacent pot (while others turn their back) and miss their next turn.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Japanese first edition", "Multilingual second edition"], "average": "5.48054", "name": "The Arabian Pots", "playingtime": "10", "boardgamemechanic": ["Memory"], "age": "6", "usersrated": "37", "boardgamefamily": ["n in a row"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["HLG 5: Patchwork", "MOBG podcast 39 This is the Real Deal, Part 2 of Spiel Essen"]}, "179957": {"rpgdesigner": ["Steven J.

When they wake up they find themselves near the tomb and their guide dead. Toppled pillars bearing hieroglyphics, a partially destroyed stairway leading the tomb entrance, and rocks blocking the entrance seem to be results of the quake.<br/><br/>Getting into the tomb is a lot harder now. Climbing the first pillar and leaping from pillar to pillar to the stairway seems to be one option. Another one is attempting to climb the cliff face to get to the stairs. But either way, a misstep could lead to the rest of the stone stairway giving way. The tomb entrance could also be trapped in other ways by the tomb&rsquo;s creators. Studying the hieroglyphics may also give them information about the tomb.<br/><br/>As they near the tomb entrance, the tomb opens and ancient mummies begin to pour out from the tomb, seemingly awakened by the desecration of the tomb entrance by the quake. Unable to avenge themselves on nature, they attack the group instead seeing them as tomb robbers.<br/><br/>"}, "179958": {"rpgartist": ["Dimas Wijil Pamungkas", "Nick Russell"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "statistics": [], "name": "Mythic Paths of the Lost Spheres: Hollow One", "rpgdesigner": ["Christen N.

The class grants a single choice at first level (what order to join), and a very few bonus feat options (six over 20 levels, half of which must be teamwork feats and half combat feats), and no other opportunities for customization. The only other classes with so few customizable abilities are spellcasters, who can create very different types of characters with spell selection and complimentary feats. Certainly players can use weapon proficiency choices and the feats gained by all characters to fine tune a cavalier&rsquo;s development, but in many ways doing so may actually weaken the character. A cavalier&rsquo;s focus on mounted combat, and regular acquisition of abilities tied to charging, makes it difficult to justify not selecting the lance (which does double damage on a mounted charge) and the chain of feats that end in Spirited Charge (allowing the cavalier to deal triple damage with a lance charge).<br/><br/>And yet, for most players, cavaliers have come to represent the iconic knights of Western Europe, with a special mount, special abilities tied to challenging and charging foes, and an order that grants them real power. And with a few tweaks, they can also be used to represent the heavy cavalry of other civilizations, from Japanese samurai to Arabic furusiyya, Egyptian mamluks, Greek hippeus, or even Mongul horse archers. But, the further a character concept is from the core chivalric knight, however, the harder it is to make the cavalier feel right, even when many of the key functions of these different warriors castes are very similar.<br/><br/>So before building a &ldquo;talented&rdquo; version of the class, we must ask &ndash; just what defines the core concept of a cavalier, if it&rsquo;s not their role as heavy cavalry or adherence to an order? If we create other class options, what makes a cavalier who decides not to focus on horseback charges and a knightly order different from fighters? Just what is the essence of the class as a whole, once a wider range of character concepts can be created by a more flexible design?<br/><br/>To answer that question, it&rsquo;s important to look at the alternate class and archetypes that are tied to the cavalier in the core rules. It&rsquo;s easy to see how samurai can be represented as Asian cavaliers (though the role is not a perfect match to historic samurai), but the various archetypes show an interesting trend as well. From emissaries to huntmasters to standard bearers, many of the cavalier archetypes are members of the ruling caste (or the sworn servants of that caste) who serve in a martial capacity without being tied to the role of heavy cavalry.<br/><br/>The Genius Guide to the Talented Cavalier is our answer to that question: a class designed around the idea of a warrior caste tied to the ruling class of society. Some cavaliers are clearly traditional knights and samurai, while others are clearly less so, but all cavaliers are trained to both fight and serve a role within their home culture. By using this broader idea of what a talented cavalier is, allowing both players and GMs to use the Talented Cavalier class to fill the ranks of noble knights, feared slave-warriors, honor-bound hunters, determined sheriffs, or even musketeers in dutiful service to their queen.<br/><br/>"}, "179989": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jeff Beck (I)"], "poll": [], "name": "Camels Ordinarily Sit Down Carefully", "playingtime": "150", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "6", "average": "7.75", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "150", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "This is a card game where up to six players take turns to evolve fish from the Cambrian era up to the Carboniferous era.
