You hold the cards...but you can't keep them all. What will you decide to collect for personal gain? And what are you willing to give up in order to destroy? The Ravens are gathering, many of whom used to be rivals. Will you rise to power or simply be...nevermore.<br/><br/>Nevermore is a casual-style, card-drafting game in which you quickly build your hand each round, collecting cards you want and poisoning your opponent's hand by passing along cards you think they can't use. Whoever holds the most of a given suit, gains the power of that suit to attack, heal, acquire Light or Shadow magicks and score victory points.<br/><br/>Will you transform all your rivals into ravens &mdash; or can they regain their human form in time to score enough victory to win?<br/><br/><br/>Nevermore can be taught in less than five minutes, yet hides a surprising amount of depth in strategy, as players try to outwit and outmaneuver their opponents. Player &lsquo;transformation&rsquo; replaces player elimination, keeping everyone in the game until the last moment, yet still rewards players who have performed better during the game. That's because a player who has become a Raven cannot win until they can find a way to transform back, but they still play, helping to doom other players and trying to collect one of two specific hands (all of one suit - or - one of every suit) to become human again.<br/><br/>Short game length encourages multiple plays per session and appeals to players of all skill levels &ndash; with plenty of underhanded plotting and backstabby goodness.<br/><br/><br/>Play Overview:<br/><br/>Players are dealt a hand of 5 cards - but they will not keep them all.<br/>During the drafting phase, players must pass three of those cards to the player on their left. From their new set of five, they must then pass two to the left. Lastly, they will pass one card left - ending the drafting phase with a final drafted hand of five cards. They will have attempted to collect cards from a certain suit (or two) trying to be the player who has the most of that suit this hand - and also carefully managing what they are passing to their opponent, to make sure they don't end up with too powerful a hand.<br/><br/>During the resolution phase, each suit is called for, one at a time. All players show cards from that suit simultaneously. The player with the most gains the power of the suit - and the strength of the ability is determined by subtracting the second highest total of that suit. Example: I hold three Attack cards. Two other players each hold one Attack card. (3-1=2) I do a 2 point attack on a player I choose. Healing, Victory points and Radiance (which draws a Light Magick card for each you have minus the second highest amount) all work the same way. All but Ravens, who kill cards of other suits in your hand. Example: I have 3 Victory, 1 Attack and 1 Raven. I must choose to sacrifice either 1 Attack or 1 Victory card from my hand as they are Resolved. Certain special hands give additional benefits and/or Victory points.<br/><br/>If your 5 Health points drop to 0, you become a Raven, still in the game, but unable to win until you can transform back.<br/><br/>The winner is either the last human player standing - or the first to score 6 Victory points.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "name": "Nevermore", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Set Collection", "Take That"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": ["Specters of Nevermore"], "usersrated": "649", "average": "6.78039", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BGA Ep. 84 - If You Like Munchkin, Try...", "BGA Episode 100 - Top 100 Games of All Time", "Cult of the New Board Game Podcast 005 \u2013 7 Wonders vs Nevermore", "Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 001", "Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 009 \u2013 Top 10 Games of 2015", "Ep 016 \u2013 BGG Con 2015 Recap Extravaganza!!", "Episode 16: GemPacked Conclusion", "The Good, The Board and the HNNNNNNGGGGG: Episode 35 \u201c2 Player Games\u201d", "Vox Republica 088: Con Season Anticipation", "Vox Republica 094: The CR At Gen Con 2015 - Part 1", "Vox Republica 101: We've Been Sabotaged!", "What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing Week 47!!! ft Chris and Joe from Cardboard Architect"]}, "173048": {"rpgdesigner": ["David Ackerman-Gray", "Chris Hockabout", "Will Moss", "Chris Williams (I)"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing"], "statistics": [], "name": "Cyberpunk 2200 - Senza Tregua (cover title typo)", "rpgartist": ["Doug Anderson", "Bob Giadrosich", "Darrell Midgette", "Shon Nowell", "B.

The result is the perfect party game that is designed to entertain all audiences. Testing knowledge of categories ranging from pop culture to geography to history to sports, the game is as much about quick thinking as it is about strategically analyzing relationships to link seemingly unrelated topics.<br/><br/>Playing on the &ldquo;six degrees&rdquo; phenomenon, Linknotize, proves the idea that everyone and everything can be connected.

It is designed for a party of 2 to 5 beginning level (0-level) characters of Tiny Size or smaller. Preferably, these characters are all rabbits, but the Quick Start rules provide options for other species of suitable Size. Whether other species are allowed by the BM, the adventure still works best if the majority of the player characters are rabbits.<br/><br/>Setting: This adventure is written to be as &quot;generic&quot; as possible, so that BMs can tailor it to their own preferences. However, its default setting is the Trucewood Vale, a fantasy realm that would feel familiar to players of the original fantasy roleplaying game. The Vale is populated mostly by intelligent animals suitable to a temperate woodlands or mountain environment similar to that of Southern California. However, it is also a &quot;holy land&quot; of sorts to animals from all over the world, some of whom come to visit on long pilgrimages; thus, just about any land animal could be encountered there. The Vale lies close to the faerie realms, as well, so small longpaw-like fey beings such as brownies and pixies could also be encountered, along with magical beasts like griffins, owlbears, or unicorns. The magic of the Vale provides all that the animals need for basic survival, so predation is largely unknown, and animals live in relative peace with one another. However, the recent arrival of longpaws to the west seems to have awakened an ancient darkness; corrupt animals and monsters have begun to appear in the land, and there are rumors that dragons will return in the near future.<br/><br/>None of these fantasy elements play a direct role in this adventure, however. &quot;Secret Of The Spooky Old Warren&quot; can easily take place in the modern world, or in prehistoric times, or anywhere else the BM can imagine.

An army was assembled, led by the greatest heroes of the age. Most importantly, a number of powerful magical weapons were created for the battle. The monster was lured into a tight canyon and the battle began.<br/><br/>At terrible cost, the Tarrasque was defeated. But not slain. It was impaled by fourteen special harpoons, the shaft made of an elongated immovable rod, each attached to a thick adamantine chain sunk deep into the canyon walls by magic. The Tarrasque was restrained.<br/><br/>A fortress, Taltasqa, was built around the Tarrasque, to watch over it. Every day its watchers hack away at the Tarrasque with powerful magic weapons to keep it weakened in case of escape. Even so, there are casualties as they misjudge its reach, or as its angry thrashing causes rock falls.<br/><br/>Thoughtless as a flood, a lightning strike, an earthquake, a brushfire, it doesn't cry out in fear, or pain, or frustration, only mindless rage. This behemoth ceaselessly struggles to free itself from the immovable harpoons. At first Taltasqa was wracked by constant tremors as it clawed away at the rock surrounding it, until all within its reach was ground to dust. Now it hovers unsupported like a grotesque levitating urchin. All that breaks the terrible silence in the canyon is the wet slither of its impaled limbs sliding back and forth along the harpoons that hold it and the occasional slap of its tail against a shaft. Its blood pools in the bowl it ground beneath itself with its own feet. The flensers must be lowered down onto the beast by chains that descend from a gantry just out of reach overhead.<br/><br/>Of course, being a powerful magical creature, the Tarrasque's blood, flesh and other body parts have certain useful properties. A side effect of keeping the Tarrasque imprisoned like this is a never-ending supply of powerful magical components. A city grew up around the fortress to house the various wizards, scholars and alchemists that came to exploit the Tarrasque's bounty. Eventually, it was almost as if the never-ending stream of Tarrasque blood, flesh, and bone was more important than imprisoning the beast itself.<br/><br/>The city is ruled by decadent nobles made nigh-immortal by their continued consumption of Tarrasque flesh. Warrior-butchers wield vorpal greatswords to hack away at the Tarrasque, and channels have been cut into the stone underneath the beast to channel the valuable blood away. The Tarrasque's distant screams and roars are a continuous background noise for the people in the city, with &quot;tarrasque-quakes&quot; common. An industry sprang up of ludicrously expensive magic items crafted from its body parts - tarrasquehide armor, tarrasquebone spears and potions and other alchemical miscellanea.<br/><br/>A delicate balance must be maintained, cut enough to support the populous, the research, and the economy, while leaving enough that the monster can never escape his prison.<br/><br/>"}, "173092": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Steffen Benndorf", "Reinhard Staupe"], "average": "6.67014", "statistics": [], "name": "Tr\u00e4xx", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Line Drawing"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "355", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2405345_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Oliver Freudenreich", "Sandra Freudenreich"], "boardgamepublisher": ["N\u00fcrnberger-Spielkarten-Verlag", "White Goblin Games"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BW038 \u2013 Spielertypen", "Tr\u00e4xx (N\u00fcrnberger Spielkarten): Spiele-Podcast Nr. 256"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2405345.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch first edition", "German first edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "poll": [], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Each player in Tr&auml;xx has an erasable game board that features lots of colored hexagons shaped into a larger hexagon, with the numbers 2-10 being scattered across this playing area.

To earn this title, you must complete dangerous scenarios in the shortest possible time frame. The most innovative element of the game is that the player uses their own 30-second sand timer as a character to be placed on the ship to perform actions. Each time a player places their own sand timer, they have to wait for the sand to run out to be able to perform the action needed. Each hole in the ship represents an area where you can perform a specific action: turning the ship, loading cannons, shooting enemy ships, repairing damage, and so forth...<br/><br/>Legacy of Pirates (previously announced as Admiral of the Black) has ten different scenarios, ranging from ordinary pirating activities like looking and shooting, to kraken-hunting, prison breaks, treasure hunts, and much more. An app for any smartphone or tablet will lead the players along the missions, assist with scenario data, random events, multiple paths, upgrades, and gamestate-saving for later sessions. It also serves as a timer for the individual round as the typical scenario lasts 2-3 rounds, each five minutes long.<br/><br/>The players have to react to events and maneuver the ship to fight enemy gunboats, catch rich merchant vessels, and avoid other obstacles. They must communicate to agree and organize things to do, but they have to be quick because time is always ticking.<br/><br/>Legacy of Pirates is swift playing with simple rules, but it's exciting and involving, with great interactions among players.

This beautifully illustrated game is suitable for players age 12 and up. The game is designed to be simple to learn, but with multiple layers of complexity that may be added based on player experience and ability. In the game, each player is a sorcerer&rsquo;s apprentice charged by their master to make their way in the world seeking to increase their Arete &ndash; or excellence.<br/><br/>The back story of the game sets it in the pre-history of modern chemistry when magicians and sorcerers were actually trained in the undiscovered properties of the natural elements.<br/><br/>As an apprentice, you must duel any other sorcerer you meet using magical elements (represented by the cards) that combine make potions and spells. Each duel, won or lost, increases your experience and understanding of the elements and therefore, increases your Arete.<br/><br/>With additional rules applied, the challenge increases as players contemplate element stacking, spell interactions, time constraints, character cards and special character abilities.  Decks are custom built by the player to suite their style of play and the strengths of their chosen character.<br/><br/>The game is available in a Starter Set that contains everything needed for two players. The kit includes 2 play mats, a full-color 24-page rule book, a timer, 4 character cards, two starter decks (identical) and two expansion decks (unique).<br/><br/>Once they learn the basics using their starter decks, the players can duel for first draw from Expansion Deck A. Each player chooses 5 new elements and customizes their deck. They may then duel again for first pick until Expansion A is depleted.

Folklore and legend is replete with tales of mysterious nomads, the last survivors of a fallen land or a dying race. They keep to themselves, hiding behind masks or aliases to avoid those who hunt them, or because they simply wish to be left alone. Strangers are often antiheros who play by their own rules and have little patience for working within organized structures of authority. They are men and women without a country or a home to call their own; whatever home they had, even if it still exists, has grown apart from them as they have grown apart from it. Most strangers live without allegiance except to their own code, and may be marked as heretics to their faith or traitors to their native land or people. They may be thinkers and thieves, philosophers and philanderers, some seeking the wisdom of the ancients to be found at the ends of the earth, others just looking for a fray. A stranger can work well with others and can form lasting bonds of friendship and alliance, but in their hearts they will always be free.<br/><br/>Path of the Stranger includes advice on creating a concept for your mythic wanderer and suggested builds, but the heart of this product is over 60 mythic path abilities tailored specifically for the stranger's particular blend of sullen secrecy and simmering need for revenge. Whether your stranger is a charming smuggler or the last of his line, a flamboyant masquerader or a spirit of vengeance, you'll find all manner of abilities designed to keep him or her alive, like apparent demise and cling to life, while putting his enemies six feet under, like an eye for an eye, harrier, and roaring rampage of revenge. Your stranger can make her way in the world with a wink and a smile with skeptical eye, streetwise seeker, and flag of convenience, but she will be as ready with a devastating quip as a lethal thrust with carve your initials, nothing to say, and use your own words against you! Whether your stranger is a scruffy high plains drifter or a globe-trotting explorer who never stays put but brings a worldly detachment to everything he does, the Path of the Stranger brings you a wealth of rules to make your heroes as mysterious as they are mythic!<br/><br/>"}, "173136": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "statistics": [], "name": "Kings of the Mountain: Dwarven Archetypes", "rpgdesigner": ["Alex Riggs", "Joshua Zaback"], "rpgproducer": ["Rosa Gibbons"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2407902.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Necromancers of the Northwest"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2407902_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Show What A Real Dwarf Is Made Of!<br/><br/>Stoic and steadfast, dedicated warriors and master craftsmen, there&rsquo;s a lot that can be said about dwarves.

Included are the dwarven deepdelver, a rogue archetype that take the dwarf&rsquo;s natural stonecunning to a whole new level, which can also literally sniff out gold and gems, the dwarven lorekeeper, a skald archetype with divine spellcasting that grants his allies a battle focus, instead of sending them into a rage, the dwarven scallywag, a swashbuckler archetype that turns a dwarf&rsquo;s small stature to his advantage, the dwarven stoutshield, a cavalier archetype for rugged mountain dwarves who fight on foot and take no quarter, and the stonespeaker, an oracle archetype for dwarves devoted first and foremost to dwarven culture and ancestors.<br/><br/>"}, "173137": {"rpgartist": ["Jacob Blackmon", "Justin Mason"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "statistics": [], "name": "Varakt's Halo: The Great Pubo Hunt", "rpgdesigner": ["Mike Myler"], "rpgproducer": ["Justin Mason", "William Myers", "Mike Myler", "Jonathan Nelson", "Stephen Yeardley"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2407901.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Occult (Psionics / Mentalism)"], "rpgpublisher": ["AAW Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2407901_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The PCs wake up shipwrecked on an isolated island, unable to escape the archipelago while the unnaturally active volcanoes that surround it continue to generate vicious currents and tumultuous weather patterns.

It includes a sheet of rule changes and the extra components needed to play.<br/><br/>From Marflow's website:<br/><br/>18Ruhr Version 2 reflects the railway history of the Ruhr area together with the development of its major industries, steel and coal. These are referenced to as Montan industries in the game.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game there are 8 private Montan companies (pMCs) on offer, 4 steel mills and 4 coal mines. After they have been bought, shares of the seven railway corporations may be purchased.<br/><br/>During the Operating Rounds both types of industry invest in equipment and generate income. Montan companies and railway corporations use for their investments the same set of Capex Cards which have replaced the train cards in other 18xx-games. Despite the Montan companies do not build railway tracks, it is essential for their development to get connected to the railway net! This will enable them to be converted into one of the six Montan Corporations and survive until the end of the game.<br/><br/>The conversion of the pMCs will take place from a certain point onwards before each Stock Round during the Montan Round. The conversion is only possible when there is a railway link to the location of the pMC. In addition it is possible to merge pMCs with Montan Corporation.<br/><br/>The game contains 18 pMCs of which 8 being selected for the starting package at the beginning of the game based on one of the five scenarios. The remaining pMC will take place in the game as well but only with a passive role. Their location may be linked to the railway net and will increase the value of the routes including their location hex. During the Montan Round the linked passive pMCs may be used for founding a Montan Corporation as well.<br/><br/>The trains in 18Ruhr Version 2 are so-called &quot;+&quot;trains. A &quot;2+2&quot;train for example may connect up to 4 towns of which not more than 2 may be large towns. Trains of the railway corporations may be bought by the Montan companies and become switch engines. The latter increase the income of the Montan companies.<br/><br/>", "usersrated": "1", "boardgameaccessory": ["18Ruhr"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Marflow Games"], "poll": [], "average": "7", "name": "18Ruhr Upgrade Kit"}, "173175": {"poll": [], "name": "Game of Thrones - Episode 2: The Lost Lords", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["PlayStation 4 Downloadable edition", "Xbox 360 XBLA Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2521492.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Game of Thrones - A TellTale Game Series"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy", "Movie, Book, TV show"], "videogamefranchise": ["A Song of Ice and Fire"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Telltale Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure", "Interactive Movie"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 4", "Xbox 360"], "usersrated": "8", "average": "6.5625", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Telltale Games"], "videogamecompilation": ["Game of Thrones (2015)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2521492_t.jpg", "description": "House Forrester is in disarray.

In the game, players choose one of the four Ghostbusters character figures &mdash; Peter Venkman, Egon Spengler, Winston Zeddemore and Ray Stantz &mdash; then select one of the game's pre-written scenarios, beginning a game session that lasts from 30 minutes to two hours, depending on the chosen scenario(s) and degree of difficulty. Each of the Ghostbusters has unique traits and talents that can assist the entire team, with highly co-operative gameplay. As players gain experience from banishing spirits, the Ghostbusters level up, gaining new abilities that help them take on greater challenges. The team can also hop in the Ecto-1, the Ghostbusters' converted ambulance, to help them quickly move through the city.<br/><br/>Ghostbusters: The Board Game comes with more than forty plastic figures, including the four Ghostbusters, Slimer, Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, Indulnas, and numerous Galloping Ghouls, Gruesome Twosomes and Boogaloo.

Lang.<br/><br/>In this game, each player fields one of the superhero teams, with each hero &mdash; Batman, Wonder Woman, Hal Jordan, Mogo, Superboy Prime, Sinestro and more &mdash; being represented by custom-tooled dice; each team must be composed of 15 dice, and a player can &quot;purchase&quot; dice only from his team. Each hero also has one or more character reference cards, which show the special abilities for the characters based on the die rolls. Different versions of these cards are available in booster packs, allowing for more customization of your team. Players use these dice to collect energy, recruit new heroes, and battle head-to-head. In addition, each player brings two basic action cards to the game, which are placed in the center of the table; both players can purchase these cards. A player wins once the opposing player has been reduced to zero life.<br/><br/>DC Comics Dice Masters: War of Light debuts both the Teen Titans and new Lantern Corps never before seen in Dice Masters!

It combines the fun of an enjoyable game with the discovery of the world of butterflies and some of the most common species in the Mediterranean area.<br/><br/>The aim of the game, fun apart, is to build the richest habitat, and this is achieved by gaining the maximum number of points: completing butterflies, attracting them with plants, trying to make them breed, or catching them (with final penalisation). You also have to ensure that neither predators nor changes in the weather nor human intervention have a negative influence in the strategy of each player.<br/><br/>The game is designed for 2-5 players of all ages, and especially from 6 years old to an adult public. We have devised three levels of difficulty so that the learning process is gradual until dominating all the aspects of the game.<br/><br/>The game has a total of 66 cards, and 40 of them represent butterflies, 17 are actions by the players and 9 refer to the weather. The butterflies chosen represent more or less the variety of diurnal species in the area and the majority are grouped by colours, an approximation to the different families.<br/><br/>Papilio is a game of simulation yet it is also competitive. This means that the dynamic of the game is agile and with continuous toing and froing, and at the end establishes a score in points that in some way is related to the concept of biodiversity and the biological cycles of these insects.<br/><br/>Thus there are more points for the butterflies that are free than those caught with butterfly nets. The diversity of the butterflies is also rewarded and the number of species of the same group. Finally, points are scored for the combination of plants and reproduction cards (caterpillars). Moreover, given the vulnerability of these insects, the game includes three species of protected butterflies, rare or in danger of extinction, species that in the game cannot be caught with butterfly nets.<br/><br/>"}, "173381": {"poll": [], "name": "If I'm Going Down...: Penelope Character Card", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play"], "yearpublished": "2014", "boardgameexpansion": ["If I'm Going Down..."], "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2413019_t.png", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Van Ryder Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2413019.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Zombies"], "age": "15", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Van Ryder Games gave this very special character card for If I'm Going Down to those who backed the &quot;Tessen&quot; Kickstarter campaign at the $12 level or above.<br/><br/>Penelope:<br/>Recently reunited with her ex-lover Agent Zero in Livingston, Penelope was forced to explain her relations with Rigo.

It is a military base built recently in the wastelands by a highly advanced, disciplined military organization with lots of resources to spare.  In your campaign, they can be either a force for good, or a force for evil.  Or they can be the very organization your PC's are a part of, and this is their base of operations as they explore the wastelands beyond!<br/><br/>Raven Watch may have been built using slave labor, or it may have been built by educated members of the organization that owns it.  The builders may have recently left a bunker or vault with knowledge from the old world (engineering, architecture, construction techniques and materials, heavy equipment operation and repair, etc.) , or they may be common survivors that have learned architecture and building techniques in their travels through the wastes.  For that matter, they may be slaves themselves.<br/><br/>No matter how it got here, the outpost is advanced.  Recycled materials were used as much as possible (which can be seen in the floors and on the rooftops), but new cement foundations were laid for the outpost, to include cement walls, and each of the towers have thick panes of glass on the tops, allowing for good views of the surrounding landscape without fear of what the weather might be doing.<br/><br/>Some of the technology found here may or may not be found elsewhere in the world.  From the fusion generators that power the facility, to the AeroChopper found on the landing pad.  The organization running Outpost Raven Watch could be very progressive indeed!<br/><br/>You can use this outpost as a starting point for your players (if you decide to make them a part of this shadowy organization), or this can be a place where the players are captured and brought too to await processing and transfer to some other part of the wastelands.  Or they could be required to assault the outpost, or infiltrate it using stealth.  There is a lot of potential here, both dangerous and rewarding.<br/><br/>This map pack contains three levels -  Ground level, the second level, and a third level showing the rooftops and tower tops of the installation.  A print key is included to assist you with printing out smaller sections of the map if you choose not to do the entire thing (and each level is as big as most Stoneworker Cartography maps, so it is recommended you only print out what you need), as well as keys for figuring out which rooms are which within the facility.

The cards are placed face down, and the starting player has a one-minute timer. The starting player takes the top card off the deck, picks a prompt, and reads it aloud.

When the timer runs out (or every Seeker announces &quot;I've got it&quot;), each Seeker reads what they've found. Seekers who didn't find text in time open to a random page and read a random sentence from it. The Picker chooses their favorite submission and awards the card to that Reader. After each round, the person to the left of the last Picker starts the next round. Once any player holds three cards, everyone passes their book to the player on their left.

In medieval England times are hard, and to feed your family you will be forced to trek into the countryside, where you hope to slay the mysterious beasts that seem to be plaguing the tiny town of Hamlet. You have heard tales of the wretched creatures regurgitated from the Hamletsmaw, and though travellers shout of their horror, they also whisper through drink-numbed lips of the treasures that may be found within their guts.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is simple; be the player with the most loot once every player is dead. The journey there is not such a simple one though.<br/><br/>Each round of gameplay consists of a day and night phase. Creatures are drawn from a deck and placed in a grid at the centre of the table, where during the day players will choose which to face. Many things will affect the outcome of this combat, such as ammunition type equipped, creature health, defence, and number of attacks, and player health and items. Combat is resolved through dice rolls, and if the player survives they may receive a loot reward. These rewards can be sold for gold, crafted into better items that will be worth more in the future, or eaten to stave off death.<br/><br/>While players have control during the day, once the sun sets and night settles across the land, the creatures in play will follow them back to camp, setting upon the doomed adventurers. No loot can be won during the chaos of night, leaving survival the only reward to a successful defence.<br/><br/>At the same time, all players are competing to become the richest hero, so back-stabbing, betrayal, theft, and murder will be in abundance. The most important thing to remember is that death is inevitable, so take joy in your friend's suffering, and race to meet them on the other side!<br/><br/>"}, "173463": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Zara Downs", "Mary Flanagan", "Andrea McClave", "Sukdith \"Sukie\" Punjasthitkul", "Viviana Ramos", "Max Seidman"], "average": "6", "poll": [], "name": "Awkward Moment at Work", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "3", "usersrated": "2", "yearpublished": "2015", "boardgameimplementation": ["Awkward Moment"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2415703_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Zara Downs"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Mary Flanagan LLC", "Tiltfactor"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2415703.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Party Game"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "We&rsquo;ve all been there.
