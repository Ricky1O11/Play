On a turn, a player starts by seeing whether she can make her photo with the current animal layout &ndash; that is, if the right animals are in the right order somewhere in the circle; if so, lays the photo down and draws another one.

This entry currently serves as a placeholder for the announced item and will likely later be removed.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Revolt and Revolution is the newest offering from our strategic partnership with Victory Point Games, and the first game we are producing from their immensely popular States of Siege series.  The idea for this and future volumes is to thematically take two existing titles from VPG's States of Siege line and add a third as-yet-unpublished game to the pack to create a GMT boxed set using larger counters, full sized cards, and mounted maps, all utilizing the talents of GMT's art and production team.<br/><br/>The States of Siege game system from Victory Point Games features solitaire play in which the player is thrust into the role of defending a central position from attackers advancing on a number of fronts using area movement.  Event cards provide the challenges and opportunities players use to fend off defeat while they battle for victory.  Each game in the series introduces new elements to the robust game engine and expands the possibilities of what can be simulated.  With each event card, players have a variety of actions possible but are limited by the number of action points on a given turn...in a States of Siege game there are just never enough points to get all the things done they would like.<br/><br/>Revolt and Revolution puts the player at the center of the epic clashes of ideology and culture in Europe through the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.  You, the player, get to participate in the conflicts of Divine Right vs Parliamentarianism, Absolutism vs Republicanism, and Despotism vs Bolshevism. You'll rub (simulated) elbows around your game table with King Charles I and Cromwell, King Louis XVI and Robespierre, Czar Nicholas II and Lenin, and participate in historic conflicts as Cavaliers battle Roundheads, Monarchists battle Jacobins, and 'Whites' battle 'Reds' across the fields, towns and cities of England, France and Russia.  The outcome of these wars changed the face of Europe and the World forever.<br/><br/>The titles in Revolt and Revolution are dynamic -- your decisions affect the course of events in both the short and long term.  Unlike most historical games which enforce a linear outcome and constrain you to the path of history, in the States of Siege game system your decisions and strategies can alter the existing timeline.  Now you have a chance to take command and make history or change it!<br/><br/>The first game in the pack is by series creator Darin Leviloff.  Soviet Dawn: The Russian Civil War 1918 - 1921 puts you in the position of defending the Bolshevik Revolution from the array of 'White' forces bent on its destruction.  Can you deal with the great crises of that time and defend the revolution? Will you withdraw from the Great War (WWI) or exercise the Bukharin Option and fight on? Can you execute the Czar in time, or will the 'Whites' rescue him? Will you fortify Petrograd or press your offensives home? How will you deal with internal and external dissent?  These are just some of the challenges to meet as you decide the fate of Communism in the 20th century.  Revolt and Revolution will include both the base game Soviet Dawn and its expansion pack.<br/><br/>The second game in the tri-pack is from series developer John Welch.  Lev\u00e9e en Masse: The Wars of the French Revolution 1789 - 1802 puts you in the position of defending the Republican Revolution from forces both within and outside of France, during the tumultuous years of the French.  Can you suppress the forces of Monarchy and Despotism to maintain the Republican spirit in France? Can you export the revolution by liberating neighboring states and creating sister Republics? Will you be able to keep order in Paris as it suffers from riot after riot? Can you rally your armies to defeat those of rival European states like Britain, Prussia and Austria?  These are just a few of the obstacles you must overcome to end Monarchy and bring forth the era of Republican government that will transform Europe in the 19th century.  Revolt and Revolution will include both the base game Lev&eacute;e en Masse and its expansion pack.<br/><br/>The third game in Volume I is a never-before-published game in the States of Siege series!  John Welch's Cruel Necessity:  The English Civil Wars 1640 - 1653 puts you in charge of Puritanism and Parliament and their attempts to usher in the Reformation and Age of Reason.  Can you create a fighting force capable of defeating the Royalist Armies of Charles I?  Can you foster Puritan religious reforms while suppressing those of your rival Protestants  and hated Catholics?  Can you forge an alliance with the Covenanters of Scotland and prevent them for going over to the King?  Can you manage the rebellions in Ireland without draining too many men and resources to do so?  These are just some of the dilemmas you must balance in order to bring an end to Divine Right Monarchy and usher in the Age of Revolution.  The GMT edition will include a grand tactical combat mini-game in addition to the base game of Cruel Necessity - after all, what fun would an English Civil War game be without the charge of cavalry and the push-of-pikes?<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>\u25cf Three 17&quot; x 22&quot; mounted maps<br/>\u25cf 88 Large Square counters<br/>\u25cf 56 Round counters<br/>\u25cf 180 Event cards (60 for each game)<br/>\u25cf Three 10-page Rules booklets (one for each game)<br/><br/>"}, "118048": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1629318.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Andreas Steiger"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Franz Vohwinkel"], "boardgamepublisher": ["999 Games", "Devir", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Giochi Uniti", "Group SNE", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "KOSMOS", "Stupor Mundi", "Z-Man Games"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1629318_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Arabian", "Card Game"], "boardgamehonor": ["2012 Fairplay \u00c0 la carte Winner", "2012 International Gamers Award - General Strategy: Two-players Nominee", "2012 Spiel des Jahres Kennerspiel Nominee", "2013 Golden Geek Best 2-Player Board Game Nominee"], "description": "Theme and overview:<br/><br/>Unlike in other cultures, the desert Tuareg men, known as Targi, cover their faces whereas women of the tribe do not wear veils. They run the household and they have the last word at home in the tents. Different families are divided into tribes, headed by the &lsquo;Imascheren&rsquo; (or nobles). As leader of a Tuareg tribe, players trade goods from near (such as dates and salt) and far (like pepper), in order to obtain gold and other benefits, and enlarge their family. In each round there new offerings are made. Cards are a means to an end, in order to obtain the popular tribe cards.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>The board consists of a 5x5 grid: a border of 16 squares with printed action symbols and then 9 blank squares in the centre onto which cards are dealt. Meeples are placed one at a time on the spaces at the edges of the board (not including corner squares). You cannot place a meeple on a square the opponent has a meeple on already, nor on a square facing opponent's meeple. Once all meeples are placed, players then execute the actions on the border squares the meeples are on and also take the cards from the centre that match the row and column of the border meeples.<br/><br/>The game is predominantly scored and won by playing tribal cards to your display. These give advantages during the game and victory points at the end. Usually cards are played (or discarded) immediately once drawn. A single card can be kept in hand but then requires a special action to play it (or to discard it to free the hand spot for another card). Each card has a cost in goods to play. Goods are obtained either from border spaces or from goods cards.<br/><br/>The display (for scoring) consists of 3 rows of 4 cards that are filled from left to right and cannot be moved once placed (barring some special cards). There is also a balance to be found between the victory point score on the cards themselves (1-3 VP per tribal card) and in the combinations per row (a full row of 4 identical card types gets you an additional 4 VP, and a full row of 4 distinct card types gets you 2 VP).<br/><br/>The winner at the end of the game is the player with the most victory points.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch first edition", "English first edition", "French first edition", "German first edition", "German first edition (w/ KedJ logo)", "Greek first edition", "Italian edition", "Japanese edition", "Spanish first edition"], "average": "7.62611", "name": "Targi", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Modular Board", "Set Collection", "Worker Placement"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["Brettspiel Adventskalender 2015", "Targi: Die Erweiterung", "Targi: The Action Tokens"], "usersrated": "5919", "boardgameaccessory": ["Targi: Character Meeples"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Continent: Africa", "Desert Theme", "Kosmos two-player series"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["#39: Two Player Games six-pack; Citrus on tap; Isle of Skye &amp; Avenue", "30 Minutes Around the Table", "DJ39: Recomanacions nadalenques 2013", "EP13\uff1a\u4ece\u91ce\u751f\u5230\u6bbf\u5802", "Episode 13: The one about our top 10 2-player games", "Episode 28 - Scythe Review", "Episode 37 - Our 2016 Enthusiastic Seals of Approval!", "Episode 44 - One Night Ultimate Shogun", "Episode 48- Murano and Wisdom Check 2", "Episode 60 - Interview with Lone Shark Games Mike Selinker", "Garrett's Games 321 - Targi, Vegas, IOS Games, and SdJ/KdJ Winners", "Garrett's Games 345 - Terra Mystica, Ginkgopolis, and Targi Re-Review", "If You Buy One Game - KOSMOS Two Player Series", "Low Player Count - Ep. 21 - Our Top 5 Two Player Games", "Low Player Count - Ep. 5 - geringe Anzahl Spieler and the Spiel des Jahres", "Low Player Count - Ep. 6 - Mano a Mano: Co-op or Competitive", "Targi (Kosmos): Spiele-Podcast Nr. 145", "The Dice Section 20: Son of Catchup", "What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing Week 39!!!

These worlds are only limited by their imagination, but if you watch children play you will see them constantly switch gears mentally and move from one encounter to the next. Most of their play resembles dreams that are sometimes exhilarating, but at the same time frustrating. It is almost like kids are looking for something in this play that they can't quite grasp.<br/><br/>I think what they are looking for are rules and obstacles to overcome. When anything is possible, nothing is remarkable. When a stuffed bear can fly up the stairs and rescue his friends without any doubt as to the outcome, there is no mental reward in that success. Video games provide real obstacles and metrics to show progress, and kids gravitate toward them as soon as they are able to play.<br/><br/>My daughter and I developed the Dungeon Adventure as a way to use her toys as a framework for creating achievement. We built a dungeon out of blocks, filled it with unseen monsters and treasures, and I asked her to select three heroes and go on a quest.

In the DS version of the game, the number of pre-generated characters player may choose from is increased to seven.

The game is set over seven levels in a full 3D world.<br/><br/>A new game currently being tested has exhausted all the heroes who have already been assigned to rescue the beautiful princess Lolita Globo. Gift, a sneaky, overweight slob with a big mouth is the latest hero to volunteer for the job. Armed with a magic staff, his mission is to conquer The Shadow of the Black Deep Dark Night (the enemy's leader). In doing so, he must lead seven dwarves to our heroine (who suffers from Snow White delusions) in seven totally mad worlds crammed with parodies of famous games and films.<br/><br/>Each of the seven worlds is inhabited by unsuspecting danger. Our relentless hero must do battle, solve puzzles, be resourceful and constantly test his abilities to survive and ultimately conquer the opposing dark forces. The seven worlds are Tiptanic, Alcatraz, Star Stress, Drakuland, Iceland, Paztec and Mine of Horror. Each world is led by one of the seven dwarves, who each have their own idiosyncratic personalities - from lust, envy, anger, laziness, miser, greed and vanity. The dwarfs provide clues as to where Gift can find the lovely Lolita. The objective is to collect the seven dwarfs from the seven different worlds and surround them around the lovely princess in the eight and final world. In so doing, Gift will be able to rescue his true love from the clutches of The Shadow of the Black Deep Dark Night.<br/><br/>As a character Gift has special talents that can be manipulated throughout the game including the ability to fly, swim, climb, jump and even undertake death-defying leaps. In addition to arming himself with a special energy-powered staff, water jets, cannons and a vast collection of imaginative weapons, the game is jam-packed with challenging real-time puzzle solving situations set against elaborately illustrated and stunning 3D environments.<br/><br/>A unique feature is how light is used to impact on the gameplay. Throughout the game Gift must fend off a host of enemies including 'the Little Clears' and 'the Little Darks'. Because the Little Clears are afraid of the dark, it's important for him to remain in the light. By doing this, the Little Clears will not be able to detect Gift. In order to eliminate the Little Darks, Gift must launch a fireball to illuminate an area so he can see the little foes. The gameplay is never predictable, and therefore requires players to constantly make decisions by working with the unfolding story by picking up power-ups and clues along the way.<br/><br/>The game enables players to change from third person perspective to first person view. This gives the game a lot more edge and variety, particularly when using arsenal of weapons. Gift employs some of the same elements as the game Heart Of Darkness, in the sense that it's also a massive game that includes plenty of characters, interaction and fluid playability.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Gift (computer game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "118095": {"poll": [], "name": "Glass Rose", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European PlayStation 2 edition", "Japanese PlayStation 2 edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Horror"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["CiNG"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Capcom Co., Ltd."], "description": "Glass Rose (Japanese: \u73bb\u7483\u30ce\u8594\u8587 Hepburn: Garasu no Bara) is a survival horror adventure video game that takes place in the 1920s.<br/><br/>The player assumes the role of Takashi Kagetani &mdash; a rookie reporter.

The Fall of Rome, the Black Plague, World War 2, they were here. Ready to help usher in the end of man. United in the goal, but never the means. Because of this, either by some sort of grand plan or merely by chance, a balance has formed, preserving the time of man again and again. The Horsemen&rsquo;s individual desires to be &quot;The One&quot; to snuff the candle of mankind&rsquo;s light actually thwarting the very event they hoped to cause. Then came the Zombie Apocalypse, and again they came. War, relishing the conflict and self destruction of humans- now even after death. Famine, bringing hunger and desperation to both the living and the undead. Pestilence, with pain and suffering that could last this time even after one&rsquo;s last breath was drawn. And finally Death, savoring the slow rot of a person&rsquo;s demise more than ever before. But this time they weren&rsquo;t alone. A Fifth Horseman has also come. One that could never exist before now. A Horseman born of music, technology, and the anger of a species on the brink. Will this new Horseman break the ages old balance that has existed and finally bring about the end of us all? Or is something else at play?<br/><br/>The Fifth Horseman is a 2 Player game where the aim is to bring about the end of man by defeating your fellow Horsemen and laying sole claim to the final Apocalypse. You accomplish this by landing various Strikes that lower your opponent&rsquo;s Life and Hand Size, as well as increasing your own. The Fifth Horseman uses 6 sided hex cards that allow each card the ability to use one of 6 different effects (Strikes).

From its ancient history as a war zone of giants and dragon-riding elves to the eldritch human dynasties who?ve come to replace them, Indo Toal flourishes amidst savage violence and lavish spellworks with the power to change the face of the world.<br/><br/>Included in Regional Settings: Indo Toal: <br/><br/>     Four New Races: From the brutally sophisticated Darkfae Hin to the savage Wildlings of the Diamondbone Highlands, Indo Toal offers players and DMs unique character options with a variety of new racial choices. These new races, and staple fantasy races are complemented by a collection of feats that build upon the original ideas woven into Indo Toal's extensive history. <br/>     Four New Spells: The spells included in Regional Settings: Indo Toal are not only designed to be useful to adventurers (as is ephemeral lantern), but also reflect the regional culture's unique influence on spellcrafting (like detect illocai). <br/>     Two New Monsters: Designed to reflect the unique wildlife of Indo Toal, the Shadowgarden Tree Frog and Unau Burden-Beast are not only interesting creatures in their own right, they also form an intricate part of life in the region. <br/>     Twenty Six New Feats: Regional Settings: Indo Toal offers a large collection of feats, most of which have specific roles to play in the culture of the realm (like the Illocai feats), as well as feats that can be transplanted to other settings without changing a single word (like High-Born). <br/>     Four Detailed Organizations: The Philosophers' Club and the Binders of Kuol offer characters a chance to become a part of the exciting political landscape of Indo Toal, while the Diamond Order seems to exist simply to facilitate adventure. These organizations emphasize the diversity of Indo Toal itself as well as the interconnectedness of characters, regions, and themes of any campaign. <br/>     New Items: Three new exotic weapons and three new alchemical creations evoke the unique nature of Indo Toal, but can be easily transplanted into other campaigns with ease. <br/>     Weaving Tips: Indo Toal wasn't meant to be quarantined.

The first occurred about a hundred years prior to the establishment of the Empire, when a team of scientists from the University was sent along with some early mining expeditions. They began to investigate and catalog the Nazren and found them to be a shy, reclusive species that shunned warfare and were content to live alongside other species that made Nizon their home. The species is truly ancient and has changed little over the course of perhaps a million years or so.

It is possible to learn and practice not just teamwork, but also strategy, negotiation, planning and focus to achieve victory. This is a streamlined 12-sided dice version, ideal for play from 90 minutes by experienced gamers.<br/><br/>Victory points are collected in the beginners&acute;game like many one dimensional military games, by capturing territories and defeating the other players. In the advanced game it is possible to play and win through the further four dimensions.<br/><br/>FIRST the military war of great land, sea and air battles.<br/><br/>SECOND the economic crisis, the struggle for economic growth and access to critical oil and iron ore resources. The price of military war is clearly seen and the player who amasses much wealth can win even without fighting.<br/><br/>THIRD the diplomatic pressure to coerce neutral nations into trade or conflict. The excitement of winning a major ally such as the Soviet Union and the pain if they change sides.<br/><br/>FOURTH the race to develop new war or economic technologies, such as jet aircraft, radar, rocketry or more efficient manufacturing through prefabrication and standardisation.<br/><br/>FIFTH the moral decisions which shaped each nation&acute;s conduct. Seizing power through violence and treachery is contrasted with close cooperation, trust, sharing and self-sacrifice in search for peace.<br/><br/>The interplay of all five dimensions on each other is the unique Moral Conflict experience. Each game progresses differently with almost unlimited options.<br/><br/>An extra guide book, with historical background, teaches strategy in five dimensions and how to master each dimension to win the game and in real life.<br/><br/>Information on Moral Conflict 1941, a deluxe 20-sided dice version for sophisticated gamers, is also to be found on BoardGameGeek.

You<br/>need to own or have a copy of the Psionics Handbook in order to utilize the information in this book. This book is a collection of play-tested alternate rules, more powers, prestige classes, psionic items, monsters and other goodies for your games. Advice on using this new material is also included, as well as advice on using the existing material from the Psionics Handbook with these new rules.<br/><br/>Special effort was given towards making the new rules and other information in this book compatible with other sources of psionics material. Even given this, many other sources should NOT be used. The most obvious of these are sources of other alternate rules, attempts to use the alternate rules in other products with those here will inevitably result in an unbalanced game. Other than this, do not use powers that are in the same &ldquo;chain&rdquo; as those that were removed from the power lists in this book. Prestige classes that advance in combat modes as a psychic warrior should be changed to grant one combat mode every four levels, while those that advance in combat modes as a psion should receive one combat mode every three levels.

It is the thirteenth game in the Fire Emblem series, and the second Nintendo developed 3DS title to utilize paid downloadable content. The game was released on April 19, 2012 in Japan, February 4, 2013 in North America and April 19, 2013 in Europe, available both at retail and digitally through Nintendo's eShop.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>See also: Gameplay of Fire Emblem<br/><br/>The game is a turn based tactical role playing game, where the player must move their characters within a grid. The game involves moving characters into positions in order to attack the opposing side, or defend against their attacks. Characters possess a certain number of health points; when attacked, they are subtracted, and the character is defeated on losing them all. Battles are typically won by attacking the opposing side until all enemy characters have lost all of their health points.<br/><br/>Many new features, or features rarely present in the series, have been added to the game. The &quot;Avatar&quot; system, originating from Fire Emblem: Shin Monsh\u014d no Nazo: Hikari to Kage no Eiy\u016b returns in greater detail, allowing the player to create and customize their own playable character.<br/><br/>In between battles, the player can explore the overworld map and converse with non-playable characters or buy items to be used in battles.<br/><br/>The game also features a class system, where different classes possess different skills, strengths, and weaknesses, with the player having the ability to change character's classes as seen in Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon. Upon reaching a certain level, units can promote to a new class and the player can select between branching choices. There are over 40 classes available in the game. Characters can have up to five skills at one time, with surplus skills held in the character's skill bank. The game features a new option to perform a Dual Strike attack with a supporting character. Adjacent characters also have a chance of performing a Dual Guard, a defensive technique which cancels out an enemy's attack altogether.<br/><br/>Characters, while battling together, have the ability to develop emotional ties to one another. Some characters are even able to pair up and have children. The player-created avatar is able to pair up and marry any opposite gendered character, eventually having children which can be used in battle. More information about the characters can be found at List of Fire Emblem Awakening Characters.<br/><br/>The player has the choice of several difficulty levels, including &quot;Normal&quot;, &quot;Hard&quot;, and even harder modes &quot;Lunatic&quot; and &quot;Lunatic+&quot;. Additionally, separate from the difficulty levels, there are &quot;Classic&quot; and &quot;Casual&quot; modes; &quot;Classic&quot; mode involves the permanent death feature the series is known for, where characters can never be revived after dying, while the &quot;casual&quot; mode allows characters to automatically revive post-battle.<br/><br/>Additionally, if two players interact with each other through StreetPass, their Avatar's party will appear both of their worlds. Players then can buy items from the party or recruit the leader either by paying or battling the team; battling increases the player's renown which is also shown to other players via StreetPass. A local multiplayer mode known as &quot;Dual Tag&quot; allows players to pair up to fight enemies to earn renown and items.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Fire Emblem: Kakusei&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "118241": {"rpgdesigner": ["Gerald Blakemore"], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Skinwalker (d20 Version)", "rpgartist": ["Manuel Gomez", "Craig Largent", "Jessica Van Hulle"], "rpgproducer": ["Cray Crouse", "Preston P.

The premise for SPACE FLEET ALPHA is simple, to be the last man standing in a great big battle royale between a number of opposing starship fleets.<br/><br/>At the start of the game each player elects to represent one of the six available factions, each of which has a unique technological advantage and disadvantage and then is dealt a number of cards face up. Players then take turns using their cards to attack and destroy their opponents' cards until all other players have been eliminated. Depending on players play styles, the gameplay can be brutally fast and efficient with fleets of ships disappearing in the blink of an eye or slow and tense as players nip at each other's heels.<br/><br/>Cards are roughly divided into ship cards, which are the most numerous and the main targets of your opponent's fleet, and bonus cards which perform a variety of special abilities ranging from defensive shields, technological bonuses, reinforcements, espionage cards and thermonuclear warheads. The first thing to realize when playing SPACE FLEET ALPHA is that the playing field is definitely not level and no two games will ever play out the same. The random nature of the deal ensures that one player will always start out on top however, fortunes can quickly change requiring players to adapt their strategy accordingly. In order to deal with this, the game actively encourages the weaker players to ally against stronger opponents as well as use any leverage they might have to blackmail other players into doing their bidding for them.<br/><br/>Of course these temporary situations only last for so long as there can be only one winner and its this aspect of the game that makes it so exciting to play. While SPACE FLEET ALPHA can be played with 2 players, the game really starts to shine with a group of 4 or more players. Independantly designed and published, SPACE FLEET ALPHA can be ordered direct from the website of the publisher The Game Crafter which prints, produces and ships the game on demand. Overall SPACE FLEET ALPHA is definitely worth a look for anyone into space battles and looking for something on the lighter side that can be played by anyone.<br/><br/>"}, "118297": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1207021.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Nate French", "Eric M.

The game materials content was a bit limited; you were given a list of the unit counters and a photograph of the map, which was a giant Stalingrad board with a few extra terrain features, especially in Finland.  The limited assertions in 2.1 appear to imply that the game was played using the rules for Stalingrad, though references in Stalingrad III to Divisional Stalingrad imply that you could also use the Stalingrad III rules.  Nonetheless, it really is a game, a bit under-presented like many other early games, such as Operation Gigantis (which eventually became Confrontation).<br/><br/>The theme is the German invasion of Russia in World War 2. The goals and game play could be identical (except for the new map and new list of counters) with either AH Stalingrad or Poultron Press Stalingrad III, depending on the optional rules choice made by the players, because the optional rules choice was to use one rules book or the other rules book.<br/><br/>If the game was played using the Stalingrad rules, the core rules were:<br/><br/>Stalingrad uses a move-combat sequence, alternating between players.  There is limited advance  (one square) or retreat (two squares) after combat.  Units have one-square thick zones of control; movement directly from one square in the zone of control of a unit into an adjoining square of the zone of control of the same unit is not allowed.  Functional terrain includes swamp (one square per turn movement), mountains (one square per turn movement, defenders are doubled), major cities (defenders doubled), rivers (defenders behind rivers are doubled if attacked only across the river), railroads (ten square movement bonus, must be taken all at once), lakes (impassible).  Weather is good in summer, snow in winter, and governed by a table in the spring and fall.  Mud halves ground movement.  Snow halves ground and rail movement, and freezes (converts to clear terrain) some swamps, rivers, lakes, and oceans.  Combat is mandatory between units that are adjacent at the end of each turn, but the attacker chooses which units attack which other units, so long as all adjacent units are in some battle.  The classical Avalon Hill D6 table, with results such as D Elim, A Elim, etc is in use.  Germans have limited replacements; Russian replacement rates escalate as the game goes on.  The objective is to capture the opposition's key cities (for the Russians, Leningrad, Moscow, Stalingrad) or to destroy the other side's army.  The Russian (implicit in rules) can also win by taking Helsinki, Warsaw, and Bucharest, and holding them for two complete turns.<br/><br/>Stalingrad was the first board war game with the modern placement of rivers down the middle of hexagons, rather than the old-fashioned placement of rivers on hex edges, as also seen in Stlingrad II.<br/><br/>"}, "118305": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1234467.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Joseph Propati"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2007", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Joseph Propati"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1234467_t.png", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Adventure", "Environmental", "Print & Play"], "description": "Game Title:  On belay &ndash; The Rock Climbing Game<br/><br/>Players: 1 or 2 players<br/><br/>Game Description:  A game where 1 to 2 players start on the bottom of a rock face and take turns trying to make their way up to the top of the summit without falling off.

(At least half of the points).<br/><br/>On you turn; you have to choose which faction of your army you will send off to battle! Attacks are made by using Order Tokens. If no Order Tokens are present on a unit, it costs just 1 token to issue orders to that unit. Issuing orders to the same unit in the same Battle Round would cost you the number of tokens present on the unit, plus 1. (So if there is one token on you unit, it would cost you two more tokens; if you had three, it would cost you four tokens, and so on).<br/><br/>After a round of battle, you may choose to redeploy you units.

The Key Card contains the numbers of picture cards in each district. It is placed face-up in the middle of the table. The remaining 63 cards are all shuffled and dealt to the players in rotation until the pack is exhausted.<br/><br/>The game is commenced by the player to the left of the dealer asking any other player for a card to complete a district of which he holds at least one card in his hand. If a player asked has such a card in his hand, he is bound to surrender it, and the first player then asks for another and so on until refused, when the right of asking is transferred to the player who refused him. The latter, in like manner, then asks for a card to complete a district in his hand, and so the game proceeds until all the districts are completed. Each district, when completed, is to be laid on the table (face downwards) by the player, and the game is won by that player who, at the conclusion, holds the most districts.

The campaign marks the debut of Frederick the Great's military career, however inauspicious this was for him personally. The war began with Prussia taking advantage of a perceived weakness of the new and first Queen of Austria, Maria Theresa, when she assumed the throne. Bavaria, France, and Saxony contested Maria's claim to the Austrian crown, as well as having long disputes over their borders or policies of the Austrian empire. Prussia sought to claim the rich province of Silesia from Austria and in a whirlwind (for the time) campaign in 1740 seized virtually the entire province. Prussia's Allies took longer to mobilize their forces and work out the disputes they had with one another to form a coalition to defeat Austria and overthrow its new queen. A long era of war in central Europe was about to begin.

As this product was rather unique in subject and content the speculation was that the game market audience would either love it, kinda like it, or flat out hate it. At Top Fashion Games we were dreaming of the &ldquo;loving it&rdquo;, figuring on (with fingers crossed) the &ldquo;kinda liking it&rdquo;, and fearing the &ldquo;flat out hating it&rdquo;. Much to our surprise the results of the pdf release gave our humble company quite a few 5 star ratings and Fantasy Fungi has become one of our most profitable sellers.<br/><br/>Though future releases of Fantasy Fungi were speculated we never intended for the first release to be a &ldquo;core book&rdquo; of any sort and as such there has been a bit of difficulty of reintroducing the nature of our game system fungi in other products without having to repeat a bit of lengthy terminologies and explanations. As such, it was decided that we should release a new fungus book that would serve as a core rules system.

But not all mountains have a source of wealth. Some have mines which initially look promising, but result in dead ends.

Larger octagonal tiles are the valley floors, and are just used to construct roads. Each valley tile has four road sections each with entry/exit points on two of the 8 sides of the octagon. There are 72 tiles consisting of 4 copies of each of 18 different tiles. When placed edge to edge, the road segments join into meandering roads.<br/><br/>Octagonal tiles do not tessellate &ndash; when you place four octagonal tiles touching each other, there is a small square space between them. The square spaces represent the mountains, and when the mountains are explored, small mountain tiles are placed in the square spaces. Each mountain tile has four road entry/exit points, one on each side.
