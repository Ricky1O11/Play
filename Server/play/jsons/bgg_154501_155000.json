A dread terror that is not of this world or any other &mdash; but rather from the spaces between the stars &mdash; demands your submission. Meanwhile, unwary investigators vainly attempt to halt this appalling chapter in the dark history of Arkham.<br/><br/>As the high priest of one of these shadowy cults, you must dominate the city. You will invoke cosmic creatures and unholy gods to receive their &quot;gifts&quot;, but you must take care to preserve your sanity and thwart the investigators who seek to stop you. This time, you are the bad guys. Why settle for the lesser evil?<br/><br/>Kingsport Festival, a game of bizarre cults set in the terrifying world of Howard Philips Lovecraft, lasts 12 rounds, each divided into six phases. All Cultists roll their dice and the one that rolled the lowest sum will play first and so on, then (in turn order) each one may invoke an Elder God by using one or more of his dice, where the sum of their values is exactly equal to the number of the Elder God, or pass. Once all the dice are placed or players have passed, in ascending order, the Elder Gods give their gifts to the Cultists who invoked them: the Cultists may have to lose Sanity points to receive the rewards. After Cultists have taken their dice back, in turn order each one may place his disk on one Building that is connected to another one he has already marked (starting from the House). To do so, he must pay the Domain resources required.<br/><br/>In turns marked with a blue marker on the Calendar, a Raid takes place: first the Event card and then the Investigator card is revealed. Each Cultist calculates his Strength by adding up any modifiers he has due to Spells, Buildings, and other game effects (such as Events, Scenarios, etc.). If his strength is greater, the Cultist receives rewards; if is less, he suffers the penalty.<br/><br/>The game ends after the twelfth round is played.

People are simply pawns in your quest to defeat the other barons and become the ruler of a unified human race. War, religion, technology - all will be used in this ultimate battle.<br/><br/>Time Barons is a fast-paced card game that pits two players in a struggle across the ages. &quot;Freedom&quot; is the operating word here! Each turn you can spend your actions however you see fit: to draw and play cards, gain followers, and advance your civilization through four distinct time periods - medieval, industrial, modern, and futuristic. Do you want to rush through the ages, hoping to obtain that technological edge, or punish such a folly with primitive weapons and fanatical attacks? Will you be relentless in your aggression or build an economic advantage? A variety of strategies are available to you at every turn.<br/><br/>The unique blend of actions, followers, and cards offers quick games where turns can be simple, like drawing three cards, or complex, involving every option available to you. And in the process, you'll find yourself doing things like putting a Plague on your opponent's Robotics Lab to slowly kill off the workers there, or attaching a Computer Network to a Church to automate the conversion of new followers. Or what about Martyring a follower you just sacrificed on your Temple so that you can draw a Doomsday Laser and fire it on the same turn?

Deal and play are anticlockwise.<br/>The dealer deals a batch of five cards to each player. The trump-caller player looks at his or her five cards and chooses and announces the trump suit. Then the dealer deals out all the remaining cards in batches of four, so that everyone has 13 cards.<br/><br/>Winning<br/>The object of the game is to score courts by winning the majority of the tricks. The team that wins at least seven of the thirteen tricks (hands) wins the deal, and a team that wins seven deals in succession scores a court.It is also possible to score a court in a single deal by winning the first seven tricks, while the opposing team scores none. The overall winners of the session are the team that has scored most courts after an agreed length of time.<br/><br/>Variations<br/>Some play that the card indicating the trump suit is kept face down, so that the players other than the trump caller do not know what the trump suit will be.<br/><br/>Some play that the trump indicator card is selected at random from the first player's first five cards without looking, so that even this player does not know what the trump suit will be until the card is revealed.<br/><br/>Double Sir<br/>Double Sir or Double Sar is a variant of Court Piece: the word sir (sar) means trick (hand). An online implementation of this variation can be found here: <a target='_blank' href='http://runng.com' rel='nofollow'>http://runng.com</a><br/><br/>The deal, choice of trumps and rules of play are the same as in Court Piece, but in this variant, a player who wins a  trick does not gather in the cards, but turns the cards of the trick face down in the centre of the table. Cards are only gathered in when the same player wins two consecutive tricks. Until then the tricks pile up in centre.<br/><br/>When a player does win two consecutive tricks, that player takes all the cards from the centre (the trick just won and the pile of previous tricks), adds them to his team's face down trick pile, and leads to the next trick. Scoring is then similar to Court Piece.<br/><br/>Variants of Double Sir: Be-ranga Double Sar <br/>In this variant the dealer deals all thirteen cards and the play begins without trumps until some player is unable to follow suit. As soon as a player cannot follow suit, the suit of the card they play instead becomes trump for the rest of the deal. No tricks can be collected until the trick after the one in which trumps are determined.<br/><br/>"}, "154539": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "2", "poll": [], "name": "Prank Call", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Acting", "Storytelling"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "99", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1919775_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Imagination Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1919775.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Party Game"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Call your friends and keep them on the line to earn points and win the game.

The objective is to win at least seven of the 13 tricks, or even better to win the first 7 tricks, or better still all 13 tricks.<br/><br/>Players and Cards<br/>The game plays with four players in fixed partnerships using a standard 52-card pack. What distinguish Satat from other Whist-like trick tacking games are the fact that the 2 of heart is the highest trump card of the game and the ways trump is decided.<br/><br/>Making Trumps<br/>The dealer shuffles, the player to dealer's right cuts, and the dealer deals a batch of five cards to each player. The trump maker, to dealer's left, looks at these five cards and announces the trump suit. Alternatively, if unwilling to decide trumps on the basis of these first five cards, the trump maker may elect to use the last four cards to determine the trump suit.<br/><br/>End Game and Scoring<br/>Normally the play ends when one team wins by taking seven tricks. However, if a team wins the first seven tricks (a 7-0 win) they may continue the play and try to win all the tricks (13-0 win). The winning team then gets to pass cards to the losing team in exchange for trump cards in a way similar to Sergeant Major.<br/><br/>There is no formal system of scoring and no fixed length to the game, but the players may like to keep track of how many games each team has won or lost.<br/><br/>Variations<br/><br/>Trup kasiet<br/>In this &quot;hidden trump&quot; variation, instead of announcing the trump suit, the trump maker places one card of the trump suit face down.

With this collection of games, up to eleven players can be accommodated at once &mdash; albeit by playing different games.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>In Lords of the Sand, each player takes on the role of one of four different gods: Anubis, Thoth, Sobek, and Khnum. Each god has its own unique agenda and special abilities.<br/><br/>Throughout the course of the game, players use Units, complete their court, use special abilities, and build temple complexes. With a combo-driven card system, as cards are played, additional actions may spawn multiple abilities, but a limited action system keeps downtime to a minimum.<br/><br/>Lords of the Sand offers multiple paths to victory, unique card play, and various special abilities with a playing time of about thirty minutes, plus ten minutes for each player above two.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>In Rise of the First Dynasty, 3-5 players vie for control over the whole of Egypt as the potential leader of the mythical first Dynasty of the ancient land along the Nile.<br/><br/>Each player has a set of three identical actions.

Then shuffle the main deck and allow each player to draw 10 cards.<br/>2) An anchor card is needed to start the game. We recommend locating a genre card from the main deck and dropping it in the center of the table to begin. The remaining genre cards should stay in the deck to be drawn randomly during gameplay.<br/>3) Decide amongst yourselves who will go first, and then continue playing clockwise.<br/>4) Players should take turns connecting cards in their hands to cards in play. Players can only play ONE card during their turn, unless instructed otherwise by a Director&rsquo;s Cut card.<br/>Tip: Cards can be dropped vertically or horizontally and connected to any open side of a card in play. The reels that are formed as cards connect should not touch unless a valid connection is made.<br/><br/>5) Connections must be verbally announced to be considered valid. A connection can be defined as the relationship between two cards. See our official rulebook for complete connection details.<br/>Example announcement: &ldquo;Jonah Hill and Leonardo DiCaprio can be connected because they were both in &lsquo;The Wolf of Wall Street&rsquo;. &ldquo;<br/><br/>6) During their turn, if a player does not have a playable card in their hand they can DRAW a card and play it immediately, if possible. If they still do not have a playable card in their hand they can draw a second time and play the card immediately, if possible. If they still do not have a playable card then their turn is over. <br/>Instead of drawing, if a player cannot play a card in their hand they can choose to SWAP up to three cards in their hand with three random cards from the main deck. Once a player has swapped cards their turn is immediately over. A player can only SWAP once per game. Cards that are discarded should be placed back into the main deck.<br/>7) A connection can be challenged at any time.<br/>8) The first person to shed their full hand wins.<br/><br/>Director&rsquo;s Cut<br/>During gameplay, when someone plays a Directors card from their hand they are allowed to draw from the Director&rsquo;s Cut deck and should follow the instructions on the card they draw.

The player who was challenged can decide which option the challenger should proceed with.<br/>If a connection is challenged and is proven INVALID then the player who was challenged must take their card back and draw an additional card.

Castle Assault seeks to break the mold of traditional card games and organically extracts the most enjoyable parts of these different genres and distill them into a standalone concept. Castle Assault plays in about 30 mins, and is for 1 or 2 Players.<br/><br/>Each Player controls a Castle on either side of the Battlefield with 10 Health and a Hero outside of the Battlefield.  Players play Units from their hand to the gameboard and these Units physically move toward the opposing Castle based on the Abilities of that Unit and your choices with the intent to bring your opponent from 10 to 0 Health.  Should you destroy your opponents Castle or destroy their Hero you win!<br/><br/>&quot;More details please&quot; - a Battle Card Game with tons of combat and strategy.  Card combat is fast and furious; every time two opposing Units touch each other in the same column, they Engage in combat (which is often), and can happen either during the Move Units step or during the Open Phase by Charging or using an Ability described on your Units.  Combat is resolved immediately with Unit cards exchanging their combat values at the same time (with no luck involved).  Should either Unit have a higher attack number then the Armor + Health of the opposing Unit, that Unit is destroyed.  Should a Unit smash the opposing Castle without a defending unit, that Unit attacks the opposing Castle directly lowering that Castles Health by the Unit's attack value.<br/><br/>Your Hero grants some bonuses throughout the game and you can even join the Battlefield to turn the tide, however should your Hero be destroyed you immediately lose the game.  As you progress through the 1-Player Campaign and complete feats or heroism you can level up and customize your Hero based on the way YOU play. <br/> Every deck is also customizable meaning your Unit selection can be optimized before battle, but note this is not a 'pay-to-play' type game.  You receive all the cards from all warbands including the 1-Player warband in the Core Edition (NO BOOSTERS).<br/><br/>Most Units have Abilities to; keep them alive, move more quickly, laterally move, resurrect, summon allies, surprise, dissipate, and damage the opposing Castle from afar.  You may feign attacks, play Commands to make your Heroes more powerful in a myriad of methods to tactically breakdown your opponent.<br/><br/>The 1-Player Campaign provides a &quot;Right-Outta-the-Box Experience&quot; with 9 Scenarios culminating in a final boss showdown.  1-Player mode operates by Monsters auto-populating in the opposing Castle with your victory condition changing every Scenario including outright smashing the opposing Castle, destroying a boss overlord, or surviving the onslaught.  With 9 Scenarios per 6 warbands it creates 54 different challenges  (9 campaigns x 6 warbands = 54 games).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "6.95731", "name": "Castle Assault", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement"], "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": ["Castle Assault: Dagger of Ill Omen Promo Card", "Castle Assault: Halting Force Promo Card", "Castle Assault: Sir Mitchell Greencastle Promo Card"], "usersrated": "67", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Solitaire Games"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Vox Republica 076: The Giant PAX East 2015 Recap"]}, "154675": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing"], "statistics": [], "name": "Starships & Spacecraft", "rpgdesigner": ["Marc W.

It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before he becomes a danger to humans as well. Someone will have to stop him before he becomes too powerful.<br/><br/>The Hedge Wizard is a new villain for Base Raiders. He is a dangerous foe in battle, using stealth and a powerful enchanted dagger to take down foes before they know what hits them. He can also craft temporary magical items that can provide him with nearly any superpower, making him an incredibly versatile antagonist. He makes an excellent addition to any campaign, as he can fight an entire team of heroes by himself. The Hedge Wizard&rsquo;s background is simple enough that it can be customized to fit in any existing campaign.

Its main purpose is to help players from all walks of life (including common man, entrepreneurs, corporate professionals, students, educators, home makers, investors) attain financial literacy. Minimum age is 15 years and above.<br/><br/>Inspired by the 2000-year old wisdom of prominent Indian economist Chanakya, this game enlightens individuals on how to manage money and connect financial knowledge to resourceful opportunities, which are ever-present in today's changing world.<br/><br/>The player initially chooses a dream out of various dreams listed on the board. Each dream has a purchase price listed on it. In order to win the game, the player must purchase his/her pre-selected dream.<br/><br/>There are two parts in the game, the first is Chakkravyuh and second is Rajmarg. All players start inside the Chakkravyuh. In the first part of the game, a player may not have enough money to buy his/her dream. Chanakya's Chakkravyuh simulates real-life investment opportunities, various market scenarios, and unforeseen life situations to throw challenges that the participants have to tackle. By successfully navigating these challenges and deriving &quot;passive income&quot; (income where each rupee works to bring you even more rupees), participants eventually build enough income generating assets to move into the second part of the game, i.e. the Rajmarg. It is in the Rajmarg that the player can acquire their pre-selected &quot;dream&quot;.<br/><br/>Even though there is no official time limit, the entire game normally lasts about 4 hours. The first player to purchase his/her dream wins the game, and that is officially the end of the game.<br/><br/>The experiential nature of a game-based environment makes the process of learning a lot more fun, and there is also a sense of competition among the participants.<br/><br/>Besides gaining financial knowledge and learning how to leverage passive income, participants will understand the real difference between an asset and a liability. Additionally, important lessons will be learned in basic accounting principles, debt financing, interpersonal communication, negotiations and joint deal-making.<br/><br/>No background in business or finance is required.

The game is recommended for ages 9 and up.<br/><br/>The game's narrative involves master thief Carmen Sandiego, who has used a time machine called the Chronoskimmer to plant her associates at key historical events, aiming to influence history by stopping these events from occurring. The objective of the game is to track down Carmen Sandiego and her henchmen by jumping through time tunnels that link historical periods together, and correct the course of history. The player visits well-known historical events, such as the signing of the Declaration of Independence and Lewis and Clark's expedition to the Pacific Northwest, and meets historical figures including Queen Hatshepsut, William the Conqueror, and Yuri Gagarin. In each segment, or case, the player must work out which items have been stolen and solve historical puzzles to stop Carmen's villains.

An action deck of 64 cards, three rink-cards and comprehensive yet easy-to-understand rules comprise the complete game (although you'll need to supply a small token, disc or coin). The cards serve multiple purposes, including passing, skating, shooting, defense, shot-blocking and goaltending. Experienced players will be able to complete a game in about an hour.<br/><br/>Note that this is NOT just a &ldquo;draw and play cards (or a take-that!) game.&rdquo; Card combinations and good decisions are key in ICIH. You&rsquo;ll always want to keep an Inside Shot card in your hand, for example, in the hope of pairing it up with a Pass or Skate card that leads to an Inside Shot. (Your brain will be working on all cylinders during the entire game, and your play will improve over time as you learn to watch for the appearance of important cards.)<br/><br/>I call the above a &ldquo;set-up.&rdquo; Three and even four-card set-ups are possible, and over time you&rsquo;ll learn what they are. You can also bluff a bit; for example, if you have a surplus of Offensive Zone (OZ) Skate or Pass cards but no Inside Shot card, you can play an OZ card which allows the play of a defensive card to tease one out of your opponent&rsquo;s hand.<br/><br/>ICIH features realistic shots on goal, scoring and game play. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll effortlessly set up end-to-end plays while at other times you&rsquo;ll only be able to dump the puck out of your own defensive zone. You&rsquo;ll shoot from the point and, after some effort, from close-in. On defense, sometimes you&rsquo;ll be able to challenge the puck-carrier and sometimes you won&rsquo;t. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll have to risk a penalty to stop an opponent&rsquo;s scoring chance. Loose pucks, blocked shots, breakaways, fighting, momentum, penalties, super-saves &ndash; they&rsquo;re all here in Ice Cold Ice Hockey!<br/><br/>"}, "154754": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Rot, gelb oder gr\u00fcn", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "1975", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1925175_t.png", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Spika"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1925175.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Dice", "Educational"], "age": "4", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Objective: be the first completing your player board with coloured chips &amp; learning colours.<br/><br/>- Acting by turns -<br/><br/>Choose a playerboard and throw a coloured d6; you may take a corresponding chip and place it upon an appropriate space of your board.

Treasures of Knowledge (aka Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? and Carmen Sandiego Treasures of Knowledge) is a game in the Carmen Sandiego franchise, released in 2001 (despite some sources saying it was released in 2002). Despite the title, this game seems to have little do with the previous Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? titles, even abandoning the long-standing formula of the series. Instead, the game seems to be based on the structure of the newest version of Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego?, which The Learning Company retitled Carmen Sandiego's Great Chase Through Time.<br/><br/>The protagonists of the game are Carmen's former partner Julia &quot;Jules&quot; Argent, an experienced ACME detective, and new recruit Shadow Hawkins, who is gadget-happy and rather arrogant. Jules and Shadow's personalities frequently bounce off each over the course of the game, similar to how Zack and Ivy were paired up in &quot;Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego?&quot;, and that they had trouble with each other, but in the end, they both got along. The Chief explains that she has paired them together because she believes their personalities complement each other and indeed by the end of the game they appear to have gained some respect for each other's methods (or have at least agreed to disagree.)<br/><br/>At the start of the game, Carmen steals a rare Franco-Italian edition of The Travels of Marco Polo (which conveniently has the title written on the cover in English) and, as the game progresses, she goes on to steal a M\u0101ori wood carving, Incan Quipus and other seemingly random items. The goal of each of the first seven missions is to recover one item, which Carmen has hidden in a puzzle somewhere in the world. The user can only unlock this puzzle by collecting items or clues from other countries, often having to solve other puzzles first. At the end of each case, the item is found and it is announced that Carmen has stolen something else.<br/><br/>As the game continues, Jules and Shadow find that each object Carmen has stolen seems to be tied to a mysterious Portuguese explorer, a lost city with a great treasure and a strange &quot;wheel&quot; design. On the eighth and final case, Jules and Shadow track down the lost city itself. Once inside the city, however, they find Carmen sitting inside a chamber filled with priceless treasures. Carmen suggests that she may be planning to lock Jules and Shadow away in the city, but Jules insists that Carmen would not do such a thing. Shadow captures Carmen by grabbing her wrist with a grapple launcher, but she inexplicably escapes through the use of a smoke bomb. Jules suggests that Carmen wanted them to find the treasure all along so that it could be put in a museum, but Shadow remains convinced that Carmen is simply a bad person. Whatever Carmen's true motivations were is left to the user's imagination.<br/><br/>Treasures of Knowledge plays its storyline more seriously than previous games, eliminating such series staples as pun-filled word play, gag names, and humorously impossible thefts. However, humor is still included in much of Jules and Shadow's dialogue. Though V.I.L.E. agents are often mentioned, only a few anonymous henchmen appear in the game. Although the animation is also more realistic, the game liberally uses limited animation techniques. Shadow's database is the same database as the one in the 1996 version of the game and location music from the 1996 version is briefly played whenever the user arrives in a new country although it quickly fades away. Jordan, which was not included in the 1996 game, is an exception to this. In Shadow's database, Jordan replaces Saudi Arabia.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?

The title, which is a part of the Carmen Sandiego franchise, was released by The Learning Company on June 1, 1999. It can be played by up to 4 players, and runs on the Mohawk engine.<br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>The player(s) are on a mission to stop Carmen Sandiego and her Master Thieves (consisting of Count Hypno, Dr. Depth, Dr. Ima LeZaarde, Jane Reaction (one of the original thieves in the 1997 version of Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego?) Otto &quot;Gnash&quot; Readmore, and Snarla Swing) from taking over the modern world. At the beginning of each mission, Chase Devineaux, the ACME Detective Agency's top agent will brief you on the suspect and which essential concept to survival in the modern world has been stolen by the Knowledge Robots (KnowBots) working for that suspect. KnowBots will try to stop the ACME agent from disabling them (or delay the destruction and automatic surrender of 1/2 of the code that reveals the suspect's location) by challenging them to several Jeopardy- like rounds of questions in the subject areas of History, Geography, Math, Crime Scene, which is similar to a memory game, English, Life Science, Physical Science, or Art and Music. If the player(s)answer correctly, they gain a certain amount of Knowledge Points dependent on the type of question being asked (For example, Multipick questions are worth 950 Knowledge Points and Rapid Fire Sort questions are worth 200 Knowledge Points apiece). If they get a question incorrect, they lose one point of Capture Energy, which is essential to the capture of the Master Thief.<br/><br/>There are three difficulty levels. Level One's questions are intended for the 4th and 5th grade student; Each player starts each mission with 30 capture Energy points. On Level Two, the questions are intended for 5th and 6th grade students; Each player starts their mission with 25 Capture Energy points. On Level three, the questions are for 6th grade students and above; Each player starts with 20 Capture Energy points. Overall, the object of the game is to get past Carmen's Know-Bots and correctly answer the questions to capture the current thief out on the loose. Some players will meet Carmen on the way, but she will not be captured until the very end of the game, which according to fans, is about 300 missions. The player has 30 distinctive missions to complete in order to complete the storyline.<br/><br/>ThinkQuick presents information in a game show format, and &quot;test...students' ability to recall information previously taught&quot;. Players receive points for correct answers. Original content can be created for the game via the custom content creator (and for example inputted by teachers for school quizzes).<br/><br/>Multiplayer<br/><br/>Carmen Sandiego's ThinkQuick Challenge offers a multiplayer option in which the player can play with friends. There are two types of multiplayer: The players can play cooperatively or competitively. If the player choose to play cooperatively, they will work in teams and score the same amount of points if one player answers a question correctly. Whereas in competition, it's vice versa. The player with the most capture energy will have the opportunity to capture the thief, but if there is a tie in capture energy, the player with the most Knowledge Points will have the opportunity to capture the thief.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Carmen Sandiego's Think Quick Challenge&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "154775": {"poll": [], "name": "Octodad: Dadliest Catch", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Macintosh Downloadable edition", "North American PlayStation 4 edition", "PSN PlayStation 4 Downloadable edition", "Windows/Mac/Linux Downloadable edition", "XBLA Xbox One Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2215602.png", "videogameseries": ["Octodad"], "videogametheme": ["Animals", "Comedy", "Physics"], "usersrated": "11", "videogamecharacter": ["Octodad"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Young Horses"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure", "Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Linux", "Macintosh", "PlayStation 4", "Windows", "Xbox One"], "videogamehonor": ["2013 Game Critics Best Downloadable Game of the Year Nominee", "2014 Global Game Awards Best Comedy Game of the Year Nominee"], "average": "6.29091", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Limited Run Games", "Young Horses"], "vgcharacterversion": ["Octodad"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2215602_t.png", "description": "Octodad: Dadliest Catch is the sequel to the splash hit, Octodad!

Your goal is to have the most valuable block of own shares. Thus, you must increase your share value and buy shares from the bank.<br/><br/>To run the factories, you need workers. When hiring Workers, demand is automatically created. But of course you want to replace your expensive workers (wage 2-5) by machines (1). To have more output from your factories you may employ new Workers or improve your factory to the next technical level.<br/><br/>You fix the price for your goods during an action round. To enhance your chances of selling goods, you improve your factories to higher levels, increase the quality and make some sales promotion. The higher these factors, the better are your chances of success - the higher the price, the lower.<br/><br/>Each player has an own set of &quot;action tokens&quot; like &quot;build and modernize factories&quot;, &quot;employ new workers&quot;, &quot;improve quality&quot; etc. On your turn you place one of those tokens on one of the free spaces in your line of the &quot;Administration board&quot; and pay the according administration costs, ranging from 2 to 10 (odd numbers). Some actions depend on how much you paid, i.e. you may buy more machines with one single action, when you pay more (= use a higher space, which is then blocked for the rest of the round). During the game your actions become more and more effective by new tokens, i.e. allow you to buy 3 machines in a single turn instead of 2, increase quality 2 levels instead of only 1...).<br/><br/>After each round of actions one kind of factories is active and you have to pay for all your workers and machines there, then sell the manufactured products. The value of your shares increases for sold products and best quality.<br/><br/>Goods may also be traded to the colonies by ship - provided you have a contract with the monopoly of the East Indian Company.<br/><br/>After four turns each of the factories has produced and the round ends. Players remove the action tokens from the administration board and reveal an event token. After 5 rounds the player with the most valuable block of shares wins. Neither being to be the one with the most shares nor being the one with the highest share value guarantees victory.<br/><br/>Arkwright allows you to act in different ways. Run all four factories with most possible output, set the focus on only two factories and improve them more than the others can; use shipping to colony or focus on the home market. In any way you have to react to the opponents and their strategy. Enter markets with deficit in supply or give up business where the other players start to push you out. Buy shares when they are cheap and increase the value, or first make money and buy shares later.<br/><br/>To get familiar with the market mechanics you may start with a 120 minutes version &quot;Spinning Jenny&quot;, but for those who like full strategy in economic themed games, the 240 minute &quot;Waterframe&quot;-Rules come with more options to improve your factory and use ships.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English second edition", "English/German first edition"], "name": "Arkwright", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": ["Commodity Speculation", "Simulation", "Stock Holding", "Variable Phase Order", "Worker Placement"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["Arkwright: Noblesse Oblige", "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2016"], "usersrated": "801", "boardgameaccessory": ["Arkwright: Second edition upgrade kit"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "average": "7.88896", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["#24: The HYPE Episode!

The next icon allows C-3PO to throw a crystal - the only offensive action available against enemies. The next icon instructs R2-D2 to access a computer terminal if he is in front of one. The next icon instructs C-3PO to Duck and the final icon Pauses the game.<br/><br/>This means that if C-3PO is walking to the left and an enemy appears, the user must quickly move four icons to the right to throw a crystal, or six icons to the right to duck! Sadly this makes the game extraordinarily frustrating to play.<br/><br/>Destroying enemies is essential to pick up key-cards, which allow R2-D2 to access higher level terminals.<br/><br/>When confronted by an obstacle, e.g. a door, lift or force-field, the user must play a mini-game on the associated terminal. This is a simple 'Simon' style game, where the computer lights a series of bulbs in a random sequence. The player must remember the sequence and reproduce it. This game is repeated a few times with increasing lengths of sequences to remember. If the player succeeds, the obstacle is removed or the lift is activated.<br/><br/>The droids have a shared health bar, which when depleted by running into enemies or other hazards, results in Game Over.<br/><br/>"}, "154874": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1969349.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Bishop Drax"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Bishop Drax"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "(Unpublished)"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1969349_t.png", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "description": "A game for two players, similar to Chess, but the board is bigger, and there are also a lot more pieces.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>One 13 X 12 squares board(totally 156 squares)<br/>74 pieces in two colours(37 pieces each side)<br/><br/>Pieces are divided in three groups:<br/>- Infantry<br/>- Cavalry and<br/>- Archers<br/><br/>Every player has the following pieces:<br/><br/>- INFANTRY UNITS - <br/>1 Leader<br/>9 Heavy Infantry<br/>11 Light Infantry<br/>   <br/>                    - CAVALRY UNITS -<br/>4 Heavy Cavalry<br/>4 Light Cavalry<br/><br/><br/>- ARCHERS -<br/>4 Infantry Archers<br/>4 Horse Archers<br/>   <br/>The object of game is to capture the enemy Leader.

The goal is to earn the most in tips by gathering plates of various types from the kitchen and then serving them to a table of patrons in your section demanding certain orders. The real magic of the game is in the pseudo-real time action system.<br/><br/>When you want to take an action - say, seat a table in your section - you have to have an action token in front of you. When you perform the action you pass the token to the player next to you. Sometimes those action tokens can pile up allowing you to do multiple things at once. Other times you&rsquo;re urging the other players to hurry up a bit so you can serve your tables.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a very madcap, social experience, with lots of table talk. With the action tokens, though, it&rsquo;s not total chaos like many real-time games - there is a lot of control worked into the mechanics. It&rsquo;s a brilliant design, and one that will appeal to many gamers whether they like real-time games or not.

To blow up trains and prevent the fruits of Western European labor being drained to fuel the Nazi war machine? To fool the Allies with the Englandspiel radio games&mdash;inducing them to fly agents and weapons right into German arms? Well, here&rsquo;s your chance! Set Europe Ablaze, named for Sir Winston Churchill&rsquo;s famous instruction for his new Special Operations Executive (SOE) to disrupt Occupied Europe, offers you the exciting opportunity to refight the Resistance War in a strategic-level game with all the trimmings.<br/><br/>Set Europe Ablaze focuses on the Resistance War in France, Belgium, and Holland, in a dynamic card-driven system that takes in all the action from 1940 through the eve of the D-Day invasion. It&rsquo;s all here! This novel game system includes SOE, MI-6, the XX (Double-Cross) Committee, French BCRA, the OSS. There are Agent Networks, Weapons Caches, Commando Raids, Jedburghs, SAS Teams, OSS Operational Groups. Their missions include Sabotage, Interdiction, Intelligence Collection, and Propaganda. The Germans deploy Security units, intelligence services&mdash;RSHA, Abwehr, Gestapo&mdash;with a higher command, and Vichy Security, plus Labor Forces, to keep the lid on the Resistance and repair the effects of their depredations. German activities range from Anti-Partisan Sweeps to Propaganda, to Damage Repair. Inter-service rivalries play their role too. From Klaus Barbie to Jean Moulin, everyone&rsquo;s efforts are bent to secure victory in the Resistance War. All the action focuses on the economic resources the Germans are able to extract from the West.<br/><br/>Designed by award-winning innovator John Prados, Set Europe Ablaze is a two-player game that uses quarterly and biennial turns to take in the expanse of the war. Play proceeds by alternating Rounds within the turn. Players utilize several types of cards to set the level of their actions, mark notable Events, and cancel the adversary&rsquo;s successes by means of Counter-Espionage. The Allied player builds Maquis strength across the regions of France and the Low Countries and supports the Resistance with Networks and other capabilities. The German builds Labor Force strength to effect repairs and deploys Security units plus intelligence detachments to quash the Resistance. Set Europe Ablaze features quick set up, elegant mechanics, and is playable by experienced players in under three hours.<br/><br/>(Note: Read more about the game's development in Prados' article in ATO No. 38, Guns of the Askari.)<br/><br/>"}, "154993": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Brenda S.

Gifts nurture and encourage good fruit in the church, which in turn manifest themselves in the form of mission.<br/><br/>As events affect the development of the church, players struggle to establish the most thriving ministry.<br/><br/>You can follow the game design thread here: <br/>WIP, Apostles, Christian card game<br/><br/>"}, "154994": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1929718.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Stockinger & Morsack"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1929718_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Travel", "Trivia"], "description": "The players move their cars according to their dice rolls on the road from the start near Vienna to Schwechat.

It is easy therefore to treat an encounter with an orc as fun, but mushy stuff makes some of us uncomfortable.<br/><br/>These three adventures follow classic, maybe even clich&eacute; quest formats: the delivery, the fetch quest, the treasure hunt.

For groups that are looking for a little valentines day massacring without getting their characters directly involved in the romance they are great adventures\u037e they can also act as a springboard for discussion on including romance themes in games (if you want to have such a discussion).

Two adventures is quite a quick leveling up for characters.

While it doesn't feature in Crown of the Lich King, it was created by the Wizard King before his fall. Characters who have taken part in any previous adventure have good reason to seek the diamond. If that isn&rsquo;t a good enough reason it is a huge diamond, and the Dragon Empire would pay to have it back (and others would pay to keep it out of the Emperor&rsquo;s hands).<br/><br/>At the end of the adventure the adventurers will find a teleportation circle that will teleport them away from the increasingly dangerous kobold lair, possibly leading to the next adventure in this series if the player so chooses to narrate it as so at the closing montage.<br/><br/>"}, "155000": {"rpgdesigner": ["Christopher De La Rosa", "Ivan Van Norman", "Robert B.
