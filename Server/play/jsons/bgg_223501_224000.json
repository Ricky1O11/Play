And it doesn&rsquo;t stop there...children ages 8-10 are exposed to an astounding 8 hours of media each day. In an age where electronics are taking over society, Tall Tales brings back the classic magic of imagination in a new and exciting family game. This creative, non-competitive storytelling game is for people of all ages. Players draw random story elements from a bag and twist their best tale using each piece, just like the world used to do before the technology revolution. The only limit is your imagination!<br/><br/>Real 3-D game includes 50 detailed game pieces, 24 full color story cards and a story bag to store game pieces.<br/><br/>5 Ways to Play:<br/><br/>Basic Game: One player reaches into the story bag and draws 8 story pieces one at a time. Player then begins telling a TALL TALE using one of the pieces drawn until all the pieces are included in the story. The story can be as wacky or fun as your imagination will allow. When the story is over, all the pieces go back into the story bag, and the next player draws to start their TALL TALE.<br/>World Tales: Follow the BASIC GAME directions. After drawing 8 story pieces, draw one story place card and use that card as an environment for your TALL TALE. As you tell your story, place your story pieces on the story place card as used.<br/>Taller Tales: Choose a number 9 to 50. One player draws one piece to use in their story. Once that piece is used, that player draws another piece which must be the next piece they use in their story. The story continues until the number of pieces chosen to use is achieved. Story place cards may be added for even more variations.<br/>Group Tales: Each player draws two or more story pieces, making the total number of pieces among all players between 10 and 20 (or whatever amount you desire). The first player chooses one piece they&rsquo;ve drawn and begins the story. Once the first player uses their piece in the tale, they pass the story onto the second player who continues, using one of their pieces. The story passes from player to player until all players have used up all their pieces. Story place cards may be added for an added challenge.<br/>Marathon Tales: Like TALLER TALES, but the number chosen is always 50 pieces (the entire bag). Have one story teller, or make it like Group Tales where the story travels from player to player. Story place cards may be added for professional storytellers.<br/><br/>"}, "223502": {"poll": [], "name": "Raid on Fort Knox", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["VIC-20 release"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Crime"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Unknown)"], "videogamegenre": ["Maze"], "videogameplatform": ["VIC-20"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Commodore International Limited (Commodore)"], "description": "<br/><br/>From printed advertising<br/>You're scurrying through a complex of tunnels below Fort Knox.

Many adventurers are familiar with wading into combat against monsters and small groups of enemies, but this is nothing next to the glory and chaos and carnage that is true war. More than simply a change in scale, the difference between war and other combat can be profound. In a war, the characters are part of something larger than themselves, contributing to the efforts of their armies, or perhaps leading those armies themselves. The priorities of a soldier are different from those of an adventurer, and often the challenges that they face are, as well. While many characters can translate their talents as adventurers to the battlefield, one who specifically focuses on warfare and battlefield tactics will have the edge on others when it comes to true war. Each installment of Weekly Wonders: Archetypes of War provides six new war-themed archetypes for a variety of classes.<br/><br/>For this book, we focus on those who lead, the tacticians and generals and lieutenants who not only direct soldiers in where to go and how to fight, but help protect those under their command from the perils of combat, bringing out their hidden potential and utilizing them to their fullest. The archetypes in this book bring these principles of leadership to the table and encourage players to take command. This book contains the following archetypes:<br/><br/>    The drill sergeant, a bard archetype that intimidates foes into obeying and allies into giving their all.<br/>    The strike leader, an inquisitor archetype focuses on tactically directing foes to hammer an enemy&rsquo;s greatest weaknesses.<br/>    The camaraderie mystery, for oracles, with a wide variety of powers based on comrades-in-arms banding together on the battlefield and inspiring loyalty in one another.<br/>    The righteous commander, a paladin archetype that can spur allies to action, and exchanges mercies for blessings that give the recipients of her lay on hands additional benefits.<br/>    The daring leader, a swashbuckler archetype whose deeds focus on aiding his allies, including helping them get up when they&rsquo;re down, and directing them to make powerful attacks.<br/>    A bonus archetype for the zealot, from Path of War Expanded by Dreamscarred Press, the selfless captain can heal allies remotely though her psychic connection to them, and grants extra bonuses and actions when using aid another.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "223548": {"rpgdesigner": ["Frank Schmidt"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Fraternity of the Dragon", "rpgartist": ["Frank Schmidt"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3468616.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Filbar"], "rpgproducer": ["Frank Schmidt"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "average": "0", "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Adventures in Filbar"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3468616_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The Triad Series comes to a head with the party be called upon to again save the land.

Each airship has two randomly combined abilities (1 aggressive and 1 passive ability; same combo for all players).<br/><br/>&bull; Resolutions: (8 tiles) The resolution module changes the way a game of Scythe ends. If you play with this module, ignore the standard end-game trigger (when a player places their sixth star, everything stops and the game ends).

One fateful day, Chaos looked down through the clouds and was sickened by its beauty. A world where all creatures were granted purpose to exist and multiply was a appalling sight to him. So he lashed out with all his might. Without warning, the One Land was struck with earthquakes, tornadoes and fires of such magnitude never seen since the Forging millennia before. As ash billowed into the sky and people were sucked into the earth, his children &ndash; Honour, Innocence, Balance, Strife and even Patience &ndash; came to see what had become of their creation. Shocked by their creator&rsquo;s homicidal anger they battled Chaos and eventually locked him within the Shard of Hope. The struggle raged in the heart of the One Land and tore it asunder, scarring it with death and destruction from which it would never recover. Amidst this scarred desert, the siblings buried the Shard within a spire of rock now known as Heaven&rsquo;s Peak and warded it with guardians to ensure the Shard would never break and Chaos would never again roam free. It was here the eldest spirit, Honour, charged a small monastery of humble and dedicated monks with its protection. The Monastery of Divine Hope was built atop Heaven&rsquo;s Peak, in the arid desert known only as the Wastes. It was here that all of the teachings of the six Spirits &ndash; including Chaos &ndash; originated. The teachings were spread across the One Land in an effort to guide, encourage and empower the survivors.<br/><br/>Yet such was the intensity of Chaos&rsquo; wrath that the One Land was split into man-made boundaries etched in blood on scrolled maps, each ruled by warlords killed and replaced with other warlords over and over for generations. Each rules over their city-states with fists of iron, greed or faith, their people eager to survive in the aftermath of their creator&rsquo;s wrath, despite the cost. Some have become touched by the radiation of the Wastes and have learned to tap into heights of power never intended for humanity&rsquo;s reach; some have turned to lesser traits for personal gain. And now something has happened that few have remembered to fear...<br/><br/>The Shard of Hope has cracked.<br/><br/>High Plains Samurai: The Rehearsal Edition is a free public playtest for an upcoming high octane story of wire-fu action in a world of gunslingers, samurai, barbarians, gangsters, and steampunk in a post-apocalyptic wasteland created in the wake of a battle of the gods. These 84 pages contain the complete rules, character creation guidelines, and a playtest scenario involving a train robbery that can only take place in the One Land. Complete surveys and earn playtest points for a chance to gain bonus Kickstarter when HPS turns to crowdfunding later this year.<br/><br/>Told with ScreenPlay, discover what makes this world tick by telling your version of the story to save the One Land from final destruction in the hands of a vengeful bandit leader seeking revenge for innocent blood spilled on sacred lands. Everything you need to experience High Plains Samurai is yours for the taking but the true legend of Black Scorpion will not be revealed until May 2017.<br/><br/>"}, "223568": {"poll": [], "name": "Lost in Nature", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Nature / Jungle"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Moongate Digital"], "videogamegenre": ["Survival"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Moongate Digital"], "description": "As a shipwrecked person, you are stranded on a beautiful and wild island.

But Nevsky exhibited sound tactical judgment, and a deployment of his own cavalry at just the right time turned the tide decisively in his favor. Similar to THE GRUNWALD SWORDS or S&amp;S I game OUR ROYAL BONES, this battle allows the Novgorod Player to choose the exact moment to bring in his horse archers (making their first appearance in the S&amp;S II series). The longer he waits, the more VP he'll score, but the greater the chance that it'll be too late.<br/><br/>The 1270 Battle of Karuse, fought on the frozen Baltic Sea, is a bit more obscure, but quite possibly more interesting. This time around it's the Livonians and their allies against a Lithuanian Army under Grand Duke Traidenis. The Lithuanians use sleds as a defensive barrier, and use hit-and-run tactics to unhorse the bold brothers. Special rules for unhorsing, dismounting, and charging the sleds give this one a lot of nuance.<br/><br/>Both battles see a force that's strong in cavalry brought low by a force that's predominantly fighting on foot. Semi-random force pools utilized in each battle provide additional replayability. As always, the core S&amp;S II system - easy to learn, teach, and play - allows for a fun, fast, streamlined medieval experience.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "0", "name": "Battles on the Ice", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Shields & Swords II"]}, "223591": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Waiting for Flight GO901", "rpgdesigner": ["Simon James Pettitt"], "rpgproducer": ["Simon James Pettitt"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3470709.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Modern"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpg": ["Waiting for Flight GO901"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)", "Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Knutepunkt Scenarios"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3470709_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>At first the plane was just delayed, now it is gone from the monitors.

The drawn top card goes back to the bottom of the DECK. Henceforth, each player takes turns to be the starting player for each cycle of attacks against the monsters in a clockwise manner. Players draw 5 cards from their STANDARD DECK as CURRENT HAND.<br/><br/>During each turn, a specified number of monster cards are drawn from the MONSTER DECK and each player may attack them according to the rules as described in TKG ARENA: The Elemental Kings. All attacks played automatically hits unless they are SOLO attacks that are LOWER than a game variable called the Strike Rate.<br/><br/>The Strike Rate refers to the minimum FACE VALUE of each solo card that needs to be used to remove a monster with 1 LIFE. Other categories of ATTACK HAND will automatically remove monsters according to the damage they deal. E.g. playing a TWINS can remove a monster with 2 LIFE or less automatically regardless of its FACE VALUE. Players may accumulate the damage of their attacks on 1 target but may not accumulate cards from multiple parties to form an ATTACK HAND.<br/><br/>Likewise, all attacks from any surviving monsters will hit automatically and the sum of all damage (based on the POWER of the monster) will be distributed evenly across all players (rounded up). E.g. 5 damage scored against 4 players means each player will suffer 2 damage. Players lose half (round down to the lower of) their remaining LIFE if they deck out and reshuffle for a new DECK. For every 10 POWER worth of monsters a player removes, his/her Strike Rate goes up by 1. When the Strike Rate is 10 for any player, SOLO attacks become ineffective.<br/><br/>The CHARGE BAR can be deployed for this game by increasing the deploying player&rsquo;s initial Strike Rate by 1, and once deployed lasts till the end of the game. All spell effects and monster special abilities (printed for TKG ARENA: Brethren of Chaos) are not used.<br/><br/>The game ends when all the monsters are killed or when all the players are eliminated. The player who eliminates the most monsters in terms of LIFE wins. When there is a tie, the accumulated POWER of the monsters removed will be considered and the higher accumulated POWER wins.<br/><br/>Other than this new semi-cooperative mode of play, TKG ARENA: Monster Mayhem offers an additional new set of 32 monsters to complement the existing 60 monsters found in TKG ARENA: Brethren of Chaos.<br/><br/>Let the mayhem begin!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "0", "name": "TKG ARENA: Monster Mayhem", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Deck / Pool Building", "Hand Management", "Set Collection"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["TKG ARENA"]}, "223610": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Michael Bergman"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Dragoneart Fantasy-Card Game Book", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "1996", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3485061_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Price Stern Sloan"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3485061.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Card Game", "Fantasy"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This is a book made to celebrate the movie Dragonheart.

You try to get into a good company on your first go and prosper for life, or get hired by an unknown small company and you are doomed. Changing jobs suggests to employers that there is something wrong with you.<br/><br/>Therefore, for pre-graduates, the process of landing your first job became hugely important, really defining your whole future. This process is called \u5c31\u6d3b (Shuukatsu),from two words: \u5c31\u8077 (Shuushoku) meaning 'to get a job' and \u6d3b\u52d5 (Katsudou) meaning 'activity'.<br/><br/>This game Shukatsu! is a co-operative game to simulate the experience of winning a job offer. The game was designed and published by a professional career advisor. He says &quot;Experience an year of job hunting, in an hour. The game is based on 20 years experience as an advisor, you would have a live experience. You may try to beat it purely as a game, but also it may be used as an job-hunting support tool. In that case, the creator may act as a facilitator to gain the best effects.&quot;<br/><br/>The game uses various types of cards, for example, for the job-hunters:<br/>Activity card - study companies, attend ability training session.<br/>Weakness card - don't study for unknown matters, habitual latecomer, impatient.<br/><br/>For the employers:<br/>Company card - industrial newspaper press, internet brokerage.<br/>Hiring requirements - co-operativeness 3+, aspiration 3+.<br/><br/>Also, some cards have Bad Events, for example:<br/> - too busy on part-time job.<br/> - suffer burnout.<br/><br/>On the setup, lay out some company cards and assign them requirements cards. These would be the goals of the game for the job-hunters.<br/><br/>Each of the players will be assigned some parameters, and some Weakness cards. By using the Activity cards, players work together to overcome those weakness, and eventually meet the requirements of those companies.<br/><br/>Every once in a while, some Bad Events occur. Players must also work together to beat them too. At the end of the game year, if all of the players have managed to meet the requirements of some of the companies, they are hired and they win. If anyone fails to get a job, they all lose.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\u30a2\u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u304c\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u300c\u5c31\u8077\u5185\u5b9a\u300d\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3002<br/>1\u5e74\u9593\u306e\u5c31\u8077\u6d3b\u52d5\u3092\u30011\u6642\u9593\u3067\u4f53\u9a13\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u300220\u5e74\u9593\u306e\u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u7d4c\u9a13\u3092\u3082\u3068\u306b\u5236\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u306e\u3067\u3001\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3068\u306f\u601d\u3048\u306a\u3044\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u4f53\u9a13\u304c\u5f97\u3089\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u7d14\u7c8b\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3068\u3057\u3066\u653b\u7565\u3057\u3066\u3082\u3044\u3044\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u5236\u4f5c\u8005\u304c\u30d5\u30a1\u30b7\u30ea\u30c6\u30fc\u30bf\u3068\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3001\u5c31\u8077\u6d3b\u52d5\u652f\u63f4\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3\u30c4\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304f\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3001\u3088\u308a\u9ad8\u3044\u52b9\u679c\u304c\u5f97\u3089\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/><br/>"}, "223619": {"poll": [], "name": "Shadow War: Armageddon", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Modular Board", "Role Playing"], "yearpublished": "2017", "boardgameimplementation": ["Necromunda"], "usersrated": "63", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3493003_t.jpg", "average": "8.4754", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Games Workshop Ltd."], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 41 - Old Games vs New Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3493003.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Miniatures", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "A reboot of Games Workshop's classic Necromunda, Shadow War: Armageddon is a squad level skirmish game with a baked in campaign system set in the hive cities of War Zone: Armageddon.<br/><br/>The box includes modular terrain, templates, and dice along with miniatures for Blood Angels Scouts and Ork Boyz.

Several hexes build up the map in any shape. There are also resource-tokens placed on some hexes those add more randomness to the map.<br/>Players can build cities, armies on game map.<br/><br/>Gameplay goes around resources. There are two types of resources: <br/><br/>     Countable resources like food, wood, stone, ore, test-tube and gold. <br/>     Special resources like horse, iron, fish, wheat, marble, diamond and mana are used to develop (science) or build (building) something. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>There is no storage for resources, a player needs to have access (by having a city near the resource) to certain number and type of resources to build something. Food is the most important resource, each city, extra population and army eats one food. You need food-surplus to build a city/army/extra population, but no problem if your food production goes under your food production (no starving to death).<br/><br/>Each player has an Economy Page (like character page in RPGs), that shows the state of his empire. Players use small markers for recording various things.<br/><br/>Player's turn have 4 phases:<br/><br/>     Money Phase: Player adds the number of his/her gold production to treasury. (Gold is the only resource in Isle of Domination, that is storaged.)<br/>     Army Moving Phase: Players can move their armies by grid lines of hexes. Combat system is very simple: if attacker's army is stronger than defender army, defender army has to be withdrawn. No die rolling this time. Army power is based on sciences, and have modifiers by terrain, city or buildings.<br/>     Dismiss Phase: Player can dismiss any number of cities, armies and extra population to create the needed food-surplus to build something.<br/>     Building Phase: Player can build a City (on a hex edge occupied by an army), increase Population, build an Army, develop a Science and/or build a Building in this phase.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The goal of this game is to reach one of the six Victory Conditions. It is possible that all other Players have stronger economies, stronger armies and bigger empires, but still you win because you reach one of the Victory Conditions.<br/>There are 6 different types of Victory:<br/><br/><br/>     Territory Victory: You dominate by having a large number of cities.<br/>     Military Victory: You dominate by having a very strong and large army.<br/>     Population Victory: You dominate by outnumbering others in population.<br/>     Science Victory: You dominate by knowledge. (You develop Future Science 2.)<br/>     Cultural Victory: You dominate by your people's cultural influence. (You build Cathedral.)<br/>     Magical Victory: You dominate by magical superiority. (You have a city near every Mana resource.)<br/><br/><br/>Randomized map preparation may make some of the Victory types easier than others.

You are in a race across the 25 laboratory cards between you and your control panels. Each player gets a 'Slipstream Gun' card that allows them to warp themselves or others to different dimensions. Some dimensions contain cards that make the trip across the board easier, while other dimensions make the journey more perilous. Players must balance their urge to race across the board with their need to blast other players into neighboring dimensions. To win, a player must make it across the lab to their own control panel.<br/><br/>Each turn every player gets to perform one movement action and one 'Slipstream Gun' action. The movement action allows the players to move their token to a neighboring card, edging ever closer to their control panel, and victory. For their 'Slipstream Gun' action, players can choose to shoot any player (sending them to another dimension) or they can 'recalibrate' their gun by flipping the card over. This changes what dimension players will go to when shot with the 'Slipstream Gun'.<br/><br/>Players start at one end of a 4x5 card grid. Their control panels are on the opposite side. All of the laboratory cards are face down and as players move on to each card, it is flipped face up and the events on the face of the card are incurred. These can offer benefits like moving forward or gaining an item card. They can also be negative like losing a turn or being sent to the 'Dark World' a dimension in which the cards are much more challenging.<br/><br/>The game ends when any player is able to make it all the way across the board and steps on to the colored control panel that matches their player token.<br/><br/>"}, "223679": {"rpgdesigner": ["Marek Golonka"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Five Paladins", "rpgartist": ["Robert Hemminger", "Lord Zsezse Works"], "rpgproducer": ["Robert Hemminger"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Avalon Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Avalon Characters"], "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Need a great NPC to give your game some thrills and fun, well Avalon is here with an other great pathfinder based product.

The spy secretly chooses one of the destinations, and flips to the chosen country's page in the handbook. Each detective is given three informant cards, and in turn each detective must play an informant to get information about the spy's secret destination. The spy must find the relevant information in the handbook and answer truthfully. The informants may provide information on various aspects such as population, industry, religion, history, economy, and so on. After a detective has played an informant, the detective must also eliminate one of the destinations on the table.<br/><br/>At any time, the detectives can decide to guess on the spy's destination. If they guess correctly, the detectives win the round; otherwise the spy wins. The spy also wins if the detectives run out of informant cards, so the detectives must manage their resources well and not spend too much time or else the spy will manage to get away. The first side to win three rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>No prior geographic knowledge is needed to play, but having some insight might still help you in deducing the spy's destination.

They are a people who struggle to maintain their ancient customs and beliefs in a world that was initially alien to them upon their arrival, and has been hostile to them ever since.<br/><br/>Song of the Woad explores the various tribes of the Woad, a largely independent and wild folk who have long resisted efforts to be either absorbed or destroyed by the many great civilizations that have risen and fallen in R&ucirc;l in the centuries since their arrival on Urth. The Woad's steadfast refusal to be assimilated has resulted in a general view of them by most peoples of R&ucirc;l as hopelessly backward, beastly, and barbaric.<br/><br/>However, a closer look reveals that there is far more to the wild folk than one might expect, as you will discover in this addition to the Lands in Shadow series.<br/><br/>"}, "223734": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3496225.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Tim Rogasch"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2017", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Oliver Freudenreich"], "boardgamepublisher": ["HABA - Habermaa\u00df GmbH"], "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3496225_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "5", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Children's Game", "Dice", "Memory"], "description": "Nighttime is quickly approaching, and it's time to get the animals tucked into the barn.

Yet, makeup can be a complicated thing. Youtube is filled with Internet celebrities who give expert advice, magazines roll out new style guides practically monthly, and everyone has a different face, meaning something that works for one person might not work so well for the next. To give younger girls an introduction to makeup, as well as a few deeper lessons about true beauty, Decker Sisters presents Pretty Pro: The Exciting Makeover Race Game.<br/><br/>To play, each player picks a character from the four playing pieces: Lauren, Izzy, Lexie, and Zoe. These characters come with profile cards that give a little background to them. These do not have any affect on the gameplay; they just allow players to get a little more into the game by picking their favorites. Each has a favorite color, pet, and hobby. They also give tips, both in fashion (&ldquo;accessorize with scarves&rdquo;), beauty (&ldquo;always wear sunscreen when outside&rdquo;), and internal beauty, described as a PrettyHeart quality (&ldquo;always have a positive attitude&rdquo;).<br/><br/>Pretty Pro is a straightforward game suitable for younger players. On a turn, a player rolls the dice and moves her or his character to a new square on the board. The goal is to land on each square necessary for the six components of a makeover: Lipstick, Blush, Eyeshadow, Brows, Earrings, and the PrettyHeart Tiara, which denotes inner beauty. The board also features stylish cities, where players draw cards. Some are good, such as &ldquo;You are always kind with your words and never say anything hurtful. Find the PrettyHeart Tiara.&rdquo; Others are not so good, &ldquo;You went to bed very late last night. Now you feel grouchy and look tired. Lose your next turn.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Facemask card. Players might be unlucky in landing on a Beauty Block square and missing out on something they need or gain the Facemask, which stops players from adding any new makeup. When a player lands on Beauty Block, she or he may move it to a new space, potentially keeping another player from getting the final square needed to win.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best part of Pretty Pro is the coloring sheets. The set comes with colored pencils and a pad for each character, and extras may be printed off the website. Through the game, whenever a player lands on a space she needs, the player may color in the makeup on the character&rsquo;s face. This is a great introduction into style, seeing what colors work, what is not enough, and what might be too much.<br/><br/>Pretty Pro is a game for two to four players aged six and up. It is a moderately long game, taking twenty to thirty minutes to play, depending on how quick and lucky the players are. With its randomized dice-rolling play and fun coloring sheets, younger players will enjoy it the most as they eagerly assemble the parts of their makeovers.<br/><br/>Which make-up artist will win the game?  Players use strategy, skill and luck as they race their friends to create the perfect look, but soon learn that inner beauty is needed before any makeover is complete.  Game cards reward kindness and cover fun topics including beauty and fashion tips.  Hurry to be the first to capture the PrettyHeart Tiara and finish the face to win this exciting makeover race!<br/> Ages 6+, 2-4 players, 15-20 minute play time, reading not required to play.<br/> Contents:  Game board, 52 card deck, coloring pencils, facemask, beauty block, PrettyHeart Tiara,  set of 4 make-up sketch pads, set of fun info cards, character playing pieces, stands, dice, instructions.<br/><br/>"}, "223759": {"poll": [], "name": "Unwritten: That Which Happened", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2524381.png", "videogametheme": ["Art", "Moral Choices"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Roxlou Games"], "videogamefranchise": ["(Unreleased Games - Cancelled)"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Roxlou Games"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2524381_t.png", "description": "<br/><br/><br/>    <br/>        <br/>UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        <br/>This game was cancelled in development.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/><br/>     Delve into a turn based strategy game with meaningful, permanent decisions<br/>     Play as successive generations of a nomadic clan, passing stories and legends down through the ages<br/>     Experience infinite novelty through randomly generated maps, units, abilities, and enemies<br/>     Make decisions that become a part of your personal &quot;story&quot;, affecting your ability to barter and ally with rival clans<br/>     Make the trek to &quot;God Mountain&quot;, a place of final judgement and potential glory<br/>     Experience a rich, exotic world inspired by international traditions of story-telling<br/>     Make your own game modules using the same tools the developer used to make the game<br/><br/><br/>The Story:<br/><br/>The People, who name themselves after their leader, have their eyes on the mountain across the tundra.<br/><br/>"}, "223760": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Original D&D Compatible Products"], "statistics": [], "name": "Three Clerical Items of Renown", "rpgdesigner": ["Matthew W.

Everything from organizing a campaign to forming alliances or playing multiplayer games is covered, making this your one-stop source of campaign material.<br/><br/><br/>Not only that, but within these pages you will find a complete, ready-to-run narrative campaign, recreating the Arkham Knight saga from the thrilling finale of Rocksteady&rsquo;s Arkham trilogy, and giving you the chance to save or destroy Gotham City. Want to see what would happen if the Arkham Knight defeated Batman? Or if the Scarecrow became the most powerful crime-lord in Gotham? Now&rsquo;s your chance! Every scenario in the campaign also comes with suggestions for alternative participants &ndash; so even if you don&rsquo;t have the right models to play the Arkham Knight storyline, you can still play the campaign with the models in your collection. You can even use the scenarios as standalone ones if you want to, adding even more variety to your games!<br/><br/><br/>Is it Just About Campaigns, Then?<br/><br/>Not quite. While much of the book is geared towards campaign play (as you&rsquo;d expect), you&rsquo;ll also find some awesome new rules that you can use in your regular games. Want to play a Predator Mode game, where a single hero stealthily takes down a mob of Henchmen? Now you can. Want to play four, five, or six-player games? We got you covered. Want character cards for a whole host of vehicles, including Batmobile variants, GCPD vans and Rattler Drones? Look no further.<br/><br/>Oh, and if you still needed an incentive to order this tome, there&rsquo;s a chance to get your hands on a limited edition Arkham Knight model, with three different head variants, while stocks last.<br/><br/><br/>&ldquo;Tonight Ends with Gotham&rsquo;s Fall&hellip;.&rdquo;<br/><br/>"}, "223886": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Reader Contribution)"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "statistics": [], "name": "2d24 Table of Pit Trap Surprises", "rpgartist": ["David E.

Players make real-life investment and career decisions, learn to balance their portfolios and plan for retirement, manage budgets and debt, and answer questions on fundamental principles of economics and finance. No prior experience needed.<br/><br/>Players start out with $100,000 cash, roll the dice, and proceed around the board. Spaces on the board correspond to different life events such as getting paid a salary, going on vacation, or picking from the three decks of cards that sit at the center of the board. The three decks of cards are: news flashes, knowledge cards, and wild cards. Newsflashes provide a news story, and players must buy and sell investments accordingly in order to win or lose money. Users may accept advice from other players for a shared win or loss in the investment. Knowledge cards are multiple choice cards that teach users key finance information that will be used in the game and life. Wild cards are life events that will cause the loser to win or lose money depending on whether or not they own the right assets. To win, a user must double their money and own a home, life and health insurance, and a retirement plan.<br/><br/>There are several levels of game play that allow for beginner users all the way through advanced users to play the game and be continually challenged.

The Council of Enlightenment came to Choe Pho seeking refuge from a terrible place known as the Fallen World. Carrying the soul energy, known as Marrow, of as many people as they could, the Council fled to a remote and hidden corner of the cosmos in the hopes of building a better world. Choe Pho would be a place where each soul would have the opportunity to refine itself, expand, grow, and attain enlightenment.<br/><br/>Crafting such a safe haven and securing it from the corrupt powers of the Fallen World proved to be a massive undertaking, even for beings of such great power and enlightenment as those on the Council. Much Marrow was expended in the process of fortifying the nascent realm from intrusion by the Karma Eaters, a race of malignant cosmic entities from the Fallen World who seek to devour the very Marrow of all living things. Once the realm was secured, the Council of Enlightenment created the Isle of Hope, which would be the birthplace of their new world.<br/><br/>The Isle of Hope was divided into four lands, each populated by one of the chosen races. To the north, the mountains and caverns that border the tamed lands of the Isle of Hope became home to the tsuchigumo, a race of arachnid humanoids who survive by trapping the various beasts of the region in their webs. The eastern forests served as the birthplace of the kitsune, a joyful celebrant race of humanoid canines. To the south, the warm grasslands of the Isle of Hope were designated as the hunting grounds of the feline nekomata. The deserts of the west were made home to the reptilian slytherine. Throughout all these lands, members of the human and tengu races were scattered to find their fortunes and pursue enlightenment.<br/><br/>Beyond the firmament of the Isle of Hope, the realm remained wild and untamed. The creation of the Isle and all the creatures upon it had strained the buddhas of the Council to their limits. From the shores of the Isle of Hope to the fortifications at the edges of Choe Pho, reality was left wild, undefined, chaotic and unpredictable. In this region, now known as the Plains of Marrow, reality remains fluid and malleable, awaiting some adventurous soul to bring order through ritual Samdhi.

We would recommend that each player should have up to 3 vessels under his command. Experienced players could probably handle more once they have got an understanding of the game system. The basic rules are quick to learn, and there are a host of optional extras to give the feel for the period.The basic rules are designed for games set around the turn of the 18th to 19th Century, however they are equally able to be used for the Dutch Wars of the 17th Century, and there are rules covering this.The game sequence is managed using a card system, which randomises when, and whose, command and action phases happen. There are advanced and more detailed rules for actions using frigates and smaller vessels.9 Scenarios and 25 typical ship classes are provided to get you into the game, as well as an easy to follow system to create your own ships based on historical research.<br/><br/>"}, "223993": {"rpgdesigner": ["Greg Gorgonmilk", "Gavin Norman"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Welcome to Dolmenwood", "rpgartist": ["Greg Gorgonmilk", "Andrew Walter"], "rpgproducer": ["Matt Hildebrand", "Gavin Norman"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3479227.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Basic D&D Compatible Product"], "rpgpublisher": ["Necrotic Gnome Productions"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3479227_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Dolmenwood is a weird folklore campaign setting &mdash; creepy, whimsical, and psychedelic in equal measure &mdash; for B/X and other vintage fantasy games.
