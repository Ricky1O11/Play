The rules cover the period from when all European nations adopted the three-man-deep platoon firing system up until the rise of the mass conscript armies of the Napoleonic era; very roughly A.D. 1740-1790, when musketry weight of fire ruled the battlefield. The rules do not try to recreate every aspect of 18th Century warfare; for example, the rules ignore most of the complexities of maneuver.<br/><br/>The rules are intended only to model the &ldquo;classic&rdquo; tactics of the period.<br/><br/>The rules are designed for games using 6-12 units per side. A game like this should take about four hours for a pair of opponents familiar with the rules to complete. Typical game setup involves two fairly equal forces facing one another across a game table laid out with terrain models representing hills, woods, streams, etc. Victory conditions to win the game may vary widely, but usually one player wins when a stated number of the enemy&rsquo;s units have been destroyed or routed off the game table before a set number of turns have been played.<br/><br/>"}, "163003": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Ray Lucas"], "poll": [], "name": "Voice of the Guns", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Miniatures", "Post-Napoleonic", "Wargame"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "Voice of the Guns is a wargames system for European Land Warfare for the period from 1850, when the muzzle-loading rifle became widely adopted, to 1916, when the tank made its appearance on the European battlefield. In that time the cavalry lost its pre-eminence on the battlefield, the artillery developed the art of indirect fire thanks to the introduction of the recoil mechanism, and the machine-gun evolved into a weapon to fear.<br/><br/>The period runs from the Crimean War, up through the wars of Italian Unification, the Austro-Prussian and Franco Prussian Wars, the Russo-Turkish War and on to the early days of the First World War. The system may also be successfully used to re-fight the American Civil War and the Russo-Japanese War of 1904.<br/><br/>The system is intended for large-scale actions up to corps and army level. The basic manoeuvre units are the infantry battalion, the cav<br/>alry squadron and the artillery battery. With the possible exception of independent machine-gun companies, further subdivision of forces is not considered.<br/><br/>The system may be used for any scale of figures from 5-6 mm through 10-12 mm and 15 mm up to 25-28 mm and is not dependent upon specific numbers of figures per unit.<br/><br/>Morale and combat systems have been streamlined to cut down calculation as far as feasible. Where possible, outcomes are automatic. While at the same time, command and control is sophisticated and designed to present players with the sort of tactical and practical problems encountered by real-life generals.<br/><br/>"}, "163004": {"boardgamedesigner": ["David Child-Dennis"], "poll": [], "name": "The Dawning of the Jet Age", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Aviation / Flight", "Miniatures", "Wargame", "World War II"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "One of the great &ldquo;what ifs&rdquo; of the Second World War involves Germany surviving long enough to field a large force of operational jets.

Then, at the end of the day, players jump into their time machines and return to the beginning to start the day over again. The catch is, when players go back in time to try the day again, their past selves are still running around. This means they&rsquo;ll have to perform all the actions from the previous version of the day, as well as three new ones. They&rsquo;ll also have an additional ship to launch. On the third try, things compound even further...making timing key.

During the game you take command over one of a few opposing races, fighting over a territory and technology left by a powerful race Trian. You have at your disposal few kinds of basic units and spaceships allowing a great deal of interaction. Different types of ships will come with the new add-ons. Tiles are two-sided and stacked into two piles during the game, which gives more tactical possibilities and, at the same time, limits randomness. Special tiles, like teleport, exmitter or trade station increase level of interaction and give even more tactical possibilities.<br/><br/>We made all possible efforts to give the game its unique, individual character and to distinguish it from others with the specific elements of game mechanisms. The goal was to make a game, which could be different each time it is played. Moreover, it was important that during the match players could decide which game variants they want to play, taking into account variable add-ons. Every add-on is a &ldquo;module&rdquo;, which can be combined with the basic version of the game and used to make your own variants. Basic version can be combined with any number of add-ons.<br/><br/>We wanted the game to be dynamic, with the playtime of about 60 min. We reached said time playing the strategic variant with the add-on &ldquo;Beginning of Conquer&rdquo;, which really pleases us. In the deluxe version, the game is composed of 84 beautifully illustrated, two sided tiles with 168 diverse graphics. There are no two identical graphics in the game; every nebula, planet and gas looks unique.<br/><br/>GAME MECHANICS AND RULES:<br/><br/>The matches are played in turns, which take place in a clockwise manner. Starting with the first player, every subsequent draws a tile in their turn and places it on the table. This way, planetary systems, nebulas and space (in which the spaceships travel) of different sizes are created. From nebulas we receive a certain amount of resources (crystals) every turn. The basic unit of the game is an emissary, who can fight over nebulas and planetary systems. If the system is won over, the emissary is able to take control of the research stations left by the Trian race. Stations can be leveled up. The points in the game can be obtained in various ways. By means of: closing planetary systems, nebulas, and space; leveling up the stations on nebulas and collecting resources (crystals) from them; conducting research or fights between ships. Game mechanics allow the application of different strategies and tactics. The game also includes tiles allowing special actions.<br/><br/>What defines Galaxy of Trian:<br/><br/><br/>    Simple rules which can be explained within few minutes, using clear, illustrated game instruction<br/>    Brilliant game mechanics, which will charm everyone and provide a great number of possible tactics and strategies. The game is incredibly exciting, it offers many ways to win and a great deal of interaction between players<br/>    Smooth and dynamic matches, without tie-ups and lengthy waiting for your turn.

The Allies, flush with victory, believe one more push will bring them home for Christmas.<br/><br/>The expected walk-over was not to be, and players will find either army a challenge to command. Allied material superiority is (mostly) balanced by German tenacity, rugged terrain, and lousy weather. Defensive-minded players will be happiest playing the Germans, but players of all temperaments will discover that there is still plenty of torque left in the Axis even at this late stage of the war. The Allies will not cross the Rhine without a tough fight!<br/><br/>Beyond the Rhine is a big game, with 3.5-mile hexes, 3.5-day turns, and counters for units from battalions up to divisions. At this scale the various Western Front battles&mdash;Market-Garden, H&uuml;rtgen, Bulge, Nordwind, Remagen, etc.&mdash;have an operational ebb and flow, but can also be viewed in relation to the whole front. A comprehensive game like this one, covering the entire Western Front, was long overdue.<br/><br/>Special rules in this 14th game of the Operational Combat Series have been carefully designed to recreate this fascinating campaign. They include:<br/><br/>Random events similar to what are found in the award-winning DAK. These cover things like Fuel Shortages, Arty Ammo Stockpiles, Lost Couriers, Railway Strikes, and Dambuster Raids. The 58 possible events add a lot of historical flavor but require very little rules overhead.<br/>The importance and difficulty of the Rhine crossings are distilled into rules allowing the bridges to be blown and repaired, and pontoons to be emplaced.<br/>Background effects of Allied air interdiction are simple and elegant (built into the Terrain Effects Chart and Weather), but the player does have the option to switch some of these planes to normal barrages and sweeps.<br/>The strategic significance of the Ruhr and the Saar, of clearing the left bank of the Rhine, and of major ports such as Antwerp are reflected by simple economic effects and the game&rsquo;s &ldquo;Broadfront&rdquo; restrictions on US supply placement and usage.<br/>The Wacht am Rhein counter-offensive is recreated by simple mechanics for off-map buildup and operational surprise.<br/>Many options are included for players wanting even more realism. For instance, there are rules for German Kampfgruppen and extra restrictions on the plethora of Allied independent units.<br/>Beyond the Rhine features three monster-sized campaigns that use a 44x66-inch map layout and over 1,000 combat units. Also included are several smaller scenarios, including a 9-turn Bulge game played on a special map (otherwise, portions of all four maps would be needed).<br/><br/>Grand Campaign: 4 maps, 70 turns<br/>Fall of &lsquo;44 (Montgomery): 2 maps, 26 turns<br/>Fall of &lsquo;44 (Bradley): 2 maps, 26 turns<br/>Operation Queen: 1 map, 9 turns<br/>Bulge Campaign: 4 maps, 40 turns<br/>A Time for Trumpets: 1 map, 9 turns<br/>Nordwind: 1 map, 13 turns<br/>Endkampf Campaign: 4 maps, 24 turns<br/>Spring of &lsquo;45 (Montgomery): 2 maps, 24 turns<br/>Spring of &lsquo;45 (Bradley): 2 maps, 24 turns.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 1/2 Week<br/>Hex: 3.5 miles / 5.6 Km <br/>Units: Company to Corps<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Five 22&quot; X 34&quot; mapsheets<br/>Eight countersheets (2,240 1/2&quot; dual-side printed counters)<br/>One 48 page OCS rules booklet<br/>One 64 page Beyond the Rhine game rules booklet<br/>Two 4 page OCS Charts &amp; Tables folders<br/>Two 8 page Beyond the Rhine Charts &amp; Tables folders (one each for Allied &amp; Axis)<br/>Three Player Aid Cards (1 sided)<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "8.57786", "name": "Beyond the Rhine", "playingtime": "3000", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Simulation"], "age": "15", "usersrated": "70", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Operational Combat Series", "World War 2: Battle of the Bulge"]}, "163098": {"rpgdesigner": ["Simon Carryer"], "rpg": ["Nod"], "statistics": [], "name": "Nod", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["Simon Carryer"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2320248.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Sword & Sorcery)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Simon Carryer Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2320248_t.png", "description": "from the PDF<br/>In this game we work together to explore and enjoy an adventure story.

Their job is to make the world come alive around the Barbarian, to make the city feel real, like it has a life of its own. Each of the supporting characters has an agenda you can choose.

It should come as no surprise, then, that wizards, witches, and other powerful spellcasters are always on the lookout for new and exciting spells to add to their repertoires. While many spells from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook received a facelift and an upgrade in Mythic Adventures, the sourcebook that introduced mythic power to the game of Pathfinder, dozens of spells were left behind. Missing Mythic Magic Volume VIII, and its predecessors, aim to give each and every spell from the core rules a full-fledged mythic upgrade, all the way from A to Z, with a special focus on making mythic spells that feel as over-the-top and larger-than-life as possible.<br/><br/>This installment includes 18 mythic spells, from divination to false vision. A mythic divine power does more than just make you more formidable on the battlefield: it causes you to exude a holy (or unholy) aura of divine wrath that strikes fear into the hearts of your deity&rsquo;s enemies. A mythic dominate monster can truly allow you to gain control of anything and anyone, with the ability to affect even creatures that are normally immune to compulsions and mind-affecting effects, although doing so is costly. Mythic elemental swarm summons continual reinforcements to replace elementals that have been slain, and expands the selection of elementals you can choose from. Even the lowly erase becomes potent with mythic power, allowing you to erase magical text, but also allowing you to reproduce any text you erase perfectly, and eventually even store magical writings in your mind.

Using your hand of cards, you move these characters to the different businesses to earn bucks in the gambling business, smuggle alcohol, or act as a film industry mogul.

Either play one of the four movement cards and move one of the eight characters, or play a card face down and take another character card from the middle of the table. Through the skillful placement of their characters, the players get money based on the street and business of their representative. And money is everything in Scheffeln! The winner is determined after one of the business spaces is empty of money.<br/><br/>Also included is the variant Speed Scheffeln. Up to 7 players may compete. 7 movement cards are revealed and players must determine, as fast as possible, which character will earn the most money after the movement cards are evaluated.

Powerful mechanized armies were met by German and Romanian forces along carefully-prepared defensive lines, which initially held off the attacks. But by late summer the Red Army had broken through, and Romania left the Axis to join the Allies in the liberation of Eastern Europe.<br/><br/>Broken Axis is a complete boxed game in the Panzer Grenadier series based on these battles. You do not need any other game to play any of its 50 scenarios. Design is by Mike Perryman, creator of our Kursk: Burning Tigers game. You can play those scenarios individually, or in one of four &quot;battle games&quot; that link them together for an intense campaign experience.<br/><br/>The Germans bring strong armored forces to the party, including Tiger and Panther tanks, Panzer IV medium tanks and the usual array of assault guns. At least that's what they have when they show up instead of leaving the fighting to the Romanians. The Romanian Army has been rebuilt from its 1941 and 1942 disasters, with German-made tanks and modern Romanian-made anti-tank guns. The Germans do provide the elite Grossdeutschland Division, and its epic stand at Tirgu Frumos is a centerpiece of the game&rsquo;s scenario set.<br/><br/>The Red Army is powerful: the new JS-2 heavy tanks are in action, along with the first examples of the T34/85. These are the first large-scale battles fought outside the pre-war borders of the Soviet Union, and the Red Army is eager to take the fight to the Romanian &ldquo;mush eaters.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The game includes four semi-rigid mapboards, with art by Guy Riessen.

Each class has a specific number of starting dice for basic attack and agility rolls and class specific skill that is unique for each of the eight classes. After players have chosen their class they are tasked with selecting the skills that their character will possess for the duration of the game. There are eight double-sided ability inserts available to each archetype allowing for a total of 24 unique versions of each of the available eight classes. Players then select their portrait and sprite representation for this game.<br/><br/>Once players have selected their class, abilities, and portrait, the players select the boss they will face at the end of the game. There are two bosses in the base game, along with eight abilities for the bosses to possess. This allows for a total of 48 unique bosses that the players can encounter at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Once set-up has completed, our heroes embark on their adventure through the dungeon. <br/>  <br/>A turn is divided into two phases. The first phase is the exploration phase during this phase each hero has 3 exploration actions that they can take. These include things such as moving into a new tile,  scrounging rooms for treasure, equipping items and resting to name a few. After each hero has taken their three exploration actions it is now time for the encounter phase. Random targeting determines where the encounter(s) will be taking place, the hero(es) that have been assigned an encounter will roll the encounter die to determine what they will have to contend with, be it monsters, events or nothing at all. During the encounter phase each hero is allowed one action and the encounter phase does not end until all monsters have been defeated. After the monsters have been dealt with the heroes gain experience and divvy up the treasure.  The &quot;Player One&quot; marker is moved all heroes move their special ability dice closer to the ready and the new player one starts the turn with their three exploration actions.<br/><br/>The dungeon and all things in it, including the boss, are designed to scale based on the number of heroes playing and the highest level hero in the dungeon. As heroes level up they gain additional attack or agility dice and their special abilities require less of a cool down between uses.<br/><br/>The base game includes 26 hex tiles, which the heroes reveal as they explore the dungeon.

It is a one hour of real time per turn game that can be completed in 5 to 10 hours of play. Beside the full battle game, several scenarios are available (Hougoumont, D'Erlon attack, Plancenoit). In addition, what if options will allow players to simulate alternate history variations to the battle.<br/><br/>Fallen Eagles provides a detailed view of the battle but in a playable way. The focus is on morale, attrition and commitment of formation (division &amp; corps) at the right time, rather than tactical chrome. The detailed order of battle and the scale of the game allow players to really see the action and the game system provides a quick but realistic resolution.<br/><br/>A new system has been created and combat result tables have been tested against actual historical results of this battle. This system is a mix of well-known concepts and new features to maximize playability and realism of outcomes.<br/><br/>Formation are given simple orders than limit their ability to freely react to any sudden change of priority. Orders take some time a while before being changed. Units are classically rated for size, quality and movement. Formations activate one after the other at player's choice but have to follow the order they received at the beginning of the turn or even before. Game features offensive fire, defensive fire, opportunity fire, charge and counter charge, retreat before combat and melee. A lot of classical &quot;prohibitions&quot; are transformed into options: for example, cavalry can move from ZOC to ZOC but risk counter charges or more opportunity fire. A ZOC of a strong unit is therefore not the same as the ZOC of a weaker one.<br/><br/>The game turn has a random ending procedure and players are never sure to have time to move all their formation reflecting the command control issues of any battle. Also, the fatigue and friction factors are built in a potentially shorter turn length in the latter stages of the battle. Focus on morale and attrition is a testimony of a battle which was a test of will of two densely packed armies fighting head to head. Players will have to choose which unit will &quot;lead&quot; the attack and take the first fire. Failing a key morale test can make the difference between a stalled attack or a promising breakthrough.<br/><br/>Game variations will include, for example, the Prussian arrival sooner or later than history, or a better weather the day before allowing for an earlier start of the french attack.<br/><br/>Victory is determined with &quot;sudden death&quot; objectives given to both sides in order to simulate historical constraints but also by control of key objectives and losses at the end of the game.<br/><br/>According to Wellington, Waterloo was a &quot;near run thing&quot;.

L'&eacute;chelle est d'une heure par tour et le jeu peut &ecirc;tre termin&eacute; en 5 &agrave; 10 heures. En plus de la bataille compl&egrave;te, plusieurs sc&eacute;narios sont disponibles (Hougoumont, d'Erlon attaque, Plancenoit). Des options permettront aux joueurs d'explorer des alternatives.<br/><br/>La chute des Aigles propose une vue d&eacute;taill&eacute;e mais jouable de la bataille. L'accent est mis sur le moral, l'attrition et l'engagement des formations (division et corps) au moment opportun, plut&ocirc;t que sur le chrome tactique. L'ordre de bataille d&eacute;taill&eacute; et l'&eacute;chelle du jeu permettent aux joueurs d'entrer dans l'action.

Les ordres peuvent se poursuivent avant d'&ecirc;tre chang&eacute;s. Les unit&eacute;s sont &eacute;valu&eacute;es de fa&ccedil;on habituelle par la taille, la qualit&eacute; et le mouvement. Les formations sont activ&eacute;es les unes apr&egrave;s les autres, au choix du joueur, mais doivent suivre l'ordre qu'elles ont re&ccedil;u au d&eacute;but du tour, voire avant. Le jeu inclut le feu offensif et d&eacute;fensif, les tirs d'opportunit&eacute;, la charge et la contre-charge, la retraite avant combat et la m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. Un grand nombre d'&quot;interdictions&quot; classiques sont transform&eacute;es en options : par exemple, la cavalerie peut se d&eacute;placer de ZDC (zone de contr&ocirc;le) &agrave; ZDC, mais est menac&eacute;e par la contre-charge ou le feu d'opportunit&eacute;. Une ZDC d'une unit&eacute; puissante n'est donc pas la m&ecirc;me que la ZDC d'une unit&eacute; plus faible.<br/><br/>Le tour de jeu comprend une fin de tour al&eacute;atoire. Les joueurs ne sont jamais certains de disposer de toutes leurs formations, refl&eacute;tant les probl&egrave;mes de commandement durant toute bataille. En outre, la fatigue et la &quot;friction&quot; se traduisent dans des tours de jeu potentiellement plus courts &agrave; la fin. L'accent mis sur \u200b\u200ble moral et l'usure, est un reflet de cette bataille qui fut une &eacute;preuve de d&eacute;termination pour ces deux arm&eacute;es, denses et combattant pied &agrave; pied. Les joueurs devront choisir l'unit&eacute; en t&ecirc;te qui conduira l'attaque et subira le premier feu.

In 1999, I started out as a hungry, wildly inexperienced and tremendously naive freelancer. Now, I'm a grizzled (nay veteran) publisher and editor who has written, edited and developed well in excess of 1,000,000 words of gaming content. I've written for big and small publishers alike and won an ENnie for Madness at Gardmore Abbey (2012 [Silver], Best Adventure). A partial list of my design credits includes: Wizards of the Coast (Monster Manual V, Exemplars of Evil, Madness at Gardmore Abbey), Paizo Publishing (Dragon Magazine and Dungeon Magazine), Expeditious Retreat Press (Legacy of Darkness, Plague), Kobold Press (Deep Magic), Rite Pubishing (Pathways magazine, Adventure Quarterly) and Raging Swan Press (Retribution, Shadowed Keep on the Borderlands, The Sunken Pyramid).<br/><br/>During my early freelance days I was very lucky to have a mentor of sorts. Stephen Radney-MacFarland at the time was the RPGA's Big Cheese and my Living Greyhawk boss. During the course of the campaign, he gave me countless pointers and pieces of advice on how to commission, edit and develop modules. He gave me tremendous insights into the design process both in the campaign and at Wizards of the Coasts. (Luckily, he also didn't strangle me despite serious provocation on several occasion). During my time on the campaign I worked on over 100 modules and wrote another 20 or so myself. I had a lot of time to practise his suggestions.<br/><br/>In 2010, I founded Raging Swan Press and have built it into one of the most successful, prolific and recognised publishers of Pathfinder compatible products in the multiverse. I've worked closely with dozens of freelancers and to date (November 2013), have released over 160 supplements, adventures and player aids.<br/><br/>I want to share with you the insights and advice I've received over the years.

After years of research, Professor R&ouml;ntgen has invented a new thingamajig that apparently is capable of modifying the atomic composition of objects, to the point it can make them shrink and grow at will.  But the underworld of science is horrifying and his &ldquo;colleague&rdquo;, archrival and former student, Professor Stern, wants to steal his idea.  In the next few days, the Academy is going to decide which department will get funds to continue their research, so lab safety has become a secondary concern.  Both professors must use their scientists and students wisely, to get the most astonishing test results, while discretely trying to sabotage your rival.<br/><br/>To get the best experimental samples, you must use the ray to manipulate the value and size of your dice, while you sabotage your opponent, by modifying his.  The higher the visible value on the die, and the smaller the die is, the more points you will get.   To win the game (and get the funds!), you will have to get the most points with this method.<br/><br/>During your turn, you can perform one or more actions (without repeating any).  The available actions are represented on the control panel board, and you will use scientists and students to trigger them.  Each turn is played in three consecutive steps.  Once you're finished, it&rsquo;s your opponent's turn, and so on until the end of the game.  These are the three steps:<br/><br/>Action Selection: Choose the actions you want to perform this turn.  First, pick a student from your hand and place in in the control panel, covering the action it&rsquo;s going to perform. Then, use your available scientists to select one or more actions, as explained below.  Note:  you can&rsquo;t repeat the action on a student card.<br/>Action resolution: In whatever order you choose, perform your selected actions, taking back the corresponding scientists and students as you do. Student cards go straight to the discard pile, but you get your scientist team back for next turn.  If you haven&rsquo;t shot the ray this turn, take the extra scientist, aside from your two regular ones.  This additional scientist will help you during your next turn.  If it is already in your possession, and you have shot the ray this turn, put it back, next to the testing room board.<br/>Hiring a new student: Once you have solved all the actions, draw a new student card from the deck.  You will continue drawing cards every turn until the deck is over.  Once the deck is depleted, keep playing your cards from your hand normally.  Once all students have been used (players don&rsquo;t have available student cards in their hands), shuffle the student cards deck to form a new face down pile on the table.  Both players draw two new student cards and continue playing normally.<br/><br/>SPA<br/><br/>De uno de los laboratorios m&aacute;s perdidos de la Atomic Biochemistry Brave Academy (ABBA), surge un grito que clama al cielo: &ldquo;&iexcl;Eureka!&rdquo;.  Tras a&ntilde;os de investigaci&oacute;n, el profesor R&ouml;ntgen ha inventado un nuevo cachivache que parece ser capaz de modificar la composici&oacute;n at&oacute;mica de los objetos, hasta el punto de poder reducirlos y aumentarlos a su antojo.  Pero los bajos fondos del mundo cient&iacute;fico son repugnantes y su &quot;colega&quot;, archienemigo y antiguo alumno suyo, el profesor Stern, est&aacute; decidido a robarle la idea. Y es que en los pr&oacute;ximos d&iacute;as se determina qu&eacute; departamento obtiene la subvenci&oacute;n de la academia para continuar con su trabajo, as&iacute; que la seguridad de los experimentos se ha convertido en algo secundario.  Ambos profesores deben emplear a sus estudiantes eficientemente para tratar de obtener los resultados m&aacute;s espectaculares posibles, mientras tratan de sabotear discretamente a su rival.<br/><br/>Para conseguir las mejores muestras experimentales, debes utilizar el rayo para manipular el valor y el tama&ntilde;o de los dados de tu color, a la vez que saboteas a tu oponente modificando los suyos.  Contra mayor sea el valor de un dado y menor sea su tama&ntilde;o, m&aacute;s puntos otorga al jugador de ese color. Para ganar la partida (&iexcl;y hacerte con la subvenci&oacute;n!), tendr&aacute;s que ser t&uacute; el que consiga m&aacute;s puntos de este modo.<br/><br/>Durante tu turno puedes realizar una o m&aacute;s acciones (sin repetir ninguna). Las acciones disponibles est&aacute;n representadas en el tablero a modo de cuadro de mandos, y para realizarlas necesitas emplear cient&iacute;ficos y estudiantes.  Los turnos se juegan en tres pasos consecutivos. Cuando los termines, le toca jugar a tu oponente y os ir&eacute;is turnando as&iacute; hasta que acabe la partida. Los pasos son los siguientes:<br/><br/>1.       Selecci&oacute;n de acciones: Selecciona las acciones a realizar. Elige un estudiante de tu mano y ponlo en el cuadro de mandos, de forma que tape la acci&oacute;n correspondiente. A continuaci&oacute;n, emplea a tus cient&iacute;ficos para seleccionar una o m&aacute;s acciones, seg&uacute;n el caso, como se explica m&aacute;s abajo. Nota:  no puedes repetir la acci&oacute;n de la carta de estudiante.<br/>2.       Resoluci&oacute;n de acciones: En el orden que desees, resuelve cada una de las acciones seleccionadas, retirando al hacerlo al estudiante o cient&iacute;ficos correspondientes. Las cartas de estudiante retiradas van a al mazo de descarte, pero los cient&iacute;ficos los recuperas para tu siguiente turno. Si no has disparado en este turno, adem&aacute;s de tus 2 cient&iacute;ficos, coge tambi&eacute;n al cient&iacute;fico extra, que te ayudar&aacute; durante el turno siguiente. Si ya lo ten&iacute;as y en este turno has disparado, devu&eacute;lvelo.<br/>3.       Reclutar un nuevo estudiante: Una vez resueltas las acciones, roba una nueva carta. Deber&aacute;s seguir robando al final de cada turno hasta que se acabe el mazo de robo.  Una vez se acabe el mazo de robo, seguir&aacute;s jugando con las cartas que te queden en la mano. Cuando se haya empleado a todos los estudiantes (no tengas cartas en la mano), vuelve a barajar los estudiantes para formar un nuevo mazo de robo y robad dos cartas cada uno, para continuar normalmente.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "Print & Play edition"], "average": "7.13556", "name": "Ray Master", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Hand Management", "Worker Placement"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "45", "boardgamefamily": ["LUDO"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["1P 110 - Far Space Foundry", "The First Roll - What's New on Kickstarter? - Episode 66: Thursday, September 15th"]}, "163187": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Wolfgang Kramer"], "poll": [], "name": "Category 5:  \tLuggage Promo Card", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2014", "boardgameexpansion": ["6 nimmt!"], "usersrated": "29", "boardgamefamily": ["Spielbox"], "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2103212_t.jpg", "average": "6.37931", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH", "W.

First, you draft cards to build you army and amass gold. Then, you use the gold to purchase battle upgrades via an auction. Finally, you pit your army against the armies of your opponents, trying to gain control of the six different districts of Capua. Each district you control makes your army that much stronger. In the end, the player who controls the most, and the most powerful districts will reign supreme over the city.<br/><br/>"}, "163254": {"rpgartist": ["Jacob Blackmon", "Rick Hershey", "Mates Laurentiu"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Drow", "rpgdesigner": ["Stephanie Connors", "J.

In both cases, each player takes command of two armies or associations operating. It receives the relevant boards of the army and pools chips and card deck of cards generals of staff. For the game on the board influenced these cards staff, especially the generals who lead our armies into battle. At the beginning of the game we have such a scenario which determines - that is suitable for autumn 1914, during the game we can not change them. Generals have characteristics that affect the gameplay. The most important is an initiative of deciding on the order of execution of commands the army and orders, informing us how many orders we can spread the chips on the board. Cards and indicate how many cards of Staff tighten at the beginning of each turn. These factors can be modified by other cards of Staff, which assign the army (up to 3 cards), putting them on these boards army generals next card. In addition, staff can use the card in a different way - by playing them as an action during your turn or turn another player. The applied procedure allows us to influence the strength and mobility of the army, and thus develop their own, each time another strategy. Cards staff played as stocks allow us to accelerate the arrival of reinforcements such as on the board, or on the contrary force the opponent deploy the neighboring front of any of several units.<br/><br/>The game consists of six or eight turns, and each of the four phases. The first three are played simultaneously by all players. In the preparation phase we select the appropriate number of cards, we draw card of weather, check supplies, we join the army staff card or change the generals at their stations. In the phase of aviation spread the chips on the board planes that make us the third phase. This is the instruction phase, in which we place our units orders - march, spread, defend, retreat, reorganization, support, or crossing. If the field with our units appeared aircraft orders, we must spread face up - in a transparent manner. It was not until the fourth and final phase of motion play as an initiative of the cards generals - from highest to lowest. We then move orders or spread. If you meet the armies opposing players battle occurs. This is to be decided on the basis of the points of strength and modifiers. The final outcome of the battle can affect tightens card battle.

Norman Churches were copied from original Frank designs.<br/><br/>Norman Church has several examples of Norman Romanesque architecture characterized by features like high arched doorways and a fortified tower for defense of the church.<br/><br/>Norman churches were most commonly found in the United Kingdom, eastern Ireland, northern France, southern Italy and Sicily, Malta, Cyprus, and the Principality of Antioch (This area is part of Turkey and Syria in the present) during the Crusades (The height of Norman influence was 1000-1100 A.D. The culture became Anglo-Norman after their conquest of England before finally becoming subsumed as part of the English culture as their culture mixed with their Anglo-Saxon subjects.) Churches in Italy often incorporated more Islamic, Lombard, and Byzantine architecture giving rise to a Sicilian Romanesque style of architecture. Most surviving Norman churches in modern times are in the United Kingdom.<br/><br/>"}, "163302": {"statistics": [], "name": "The Treasure of Skull Rock", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "5", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2107404_t.jpg", "average": "4.68", "boardgamepublisher": ["University Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2107404.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["The Treasure of Skull Rock"], "maxplaytime": "20", "poll": [], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "From University Games: Do you have what it takes to find the treasure without waking up the haunted Skull?

The programs were an eclectic mix of simple games and utilities:<br/><br/>1. Rings Around Saturn - Escape from Saturn, avoiding its rings and before you run out of fuel.<br/><br/>The game displays a flying saucer and two sets of &quot;O&quot;s, depicting an edge-on view of Saturn's rings. There are gaps in the rings and the aim of the game is to move your saucer through a large enough gap in the rings within a tight time limit.<br/><br/>2. Secret Code - How quickly can you work out the code which the computer has selected?<br/><br/>This is a simple computer version of Mastermind. The computer selects a 4 digit code, using numbers from 1-6. The player guesses the code and the computer responds with an X if a digit has been guessed correctly and is in the correct location, an O if a digit is correct, but in the wrong location, or blank if a guessed digit is completely incorrect. The user has 10 guesses to deduce the correct code.<br/><br/>3. Mindboggling - A solo or party game to create words from computer selected letters.<br/><br/>This is a computer implementation of Boggle, in which the player tries to create words from a 4x4 grid of randomly selected letters. Yet the user does not enter words into the computer - there is no computer checking of the answers. Indeed the instructions state that the user should select how long they want to play, and which rules to use. The computer just displays a grid of letters and a timer.<br/><br/>4. Silhouette - Generate your own computer assisted silhouette<br/><br/>The computer generates a random start point. By using the arrow keys (keys 5-8 on the ZX81) and keys 1-4 for diagonals, the user can draw a line on screen to create a doodle. This is exactly the same as &quot;Doodle&quot; on Super Programs 1, except that the background is black and the line is drawn in white.<br/><br/>5.

Tha map covers the entire southern section of the peninsula from the Sari Bair range to Cape Helles (i.e. from Anzac to Helles, including all the forts in between). Daylight turns are two hours, night turns are four hours.<br/><br/>Information from publisher's website:<br/><br/>On 25th April 1915, Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, launched a hastily assembled force of British, Australian, New Zealand and French troops against the Turkish defenses on the Gallipoli peninsula. Their goal was to capture the forts that guarded the Dardanelles. With that achieved, the British and French Fleets would sail to Constantinople, topple the Ottoman government, and open up a supply line to Russia.<br/><br/>However, defending the beaches was an equal number of Turkish divisions, hardened in the recent Balkan Wars, led by well-trained Turkish officers, supported by advisors from the German General Staff.<br/><br/>An hour before dawn, in complete silence, the Anzacs rowed ashore at Ari Burnu, a place later to be famous as Anzac Cove. The Royal Navy had landed them in the wrong place! Huge dirt cliffs and scrub-choked washouts confronted them, rather than a beach and low dunes. Nevertheless inland they went, overrunning the Turkish pickets, only to become hopelessly confused by the night landing, jigsaw terrain, and inexperience.<br/><br/>Several miles inland, a gifted Turkish Officer, Mustafa Kemal, was reviewing his regiment after night maneuvers above Ari Burnu. Kemal's quick and furious counter-attack saved the day for the Ottomans, and set him on the path to become the founder of modern Turkey.<br/><br/>Further south, at Cape Helles, the Lancashire Fusiliers won six Victoria Crosses - before breakfast - as they ripped through the barbed wire on the beach. The invaders never reached even their first day's objectives, although the Turks only avoided defeat by a hair's breadth. With a different plan, they might have thrown the invaders back into the sea.<br/><br/>Gallipoli 1915: Churchill's Greatest Gamble realistically covers the first three days of the campaign, a time of wild maneuver, of decisive attacks parried by the timely arrival of reinforcements, and the onset of trench warfare. Speed - but not reckless haste - is the key to success.<br/><br/>The map covers the entire peninsula from north of Anzac Cove to Cape Helles, based on the 1922 British Ordnance Survey. Players can choose to land at the historical beaches, or create their own plans.<br/><br/>The game system emphasizes command and control. Players command by Brigade and Regiment. To be successful, a player must plan for the eventual exhaustion of their troops, rotating them out of line to rest and recover stragglers. The result is an accurate modeling of the tempo of these battles.<br/><br/>Infantry combat is ranged rifle and MG fire, culminating in close assault. Artillery is powerful but ultimately limited.

You have three main departments that are the money makers of the business: Grooming, Veterinarian, and Training.  These three departments can be run by a contractor, a trained contractor &ldquo;specialists&rdquo; or a Professional.  There are two other departments that take in new strays or donated pets and sell them once they&rsquo;ve been through the three main departments: Sales floor and the Kennels.  The last office is the Manager's Office, which is where you must be to hire new contractors or professionals, fire bad employees or send your contractor out for training to become specialist.  The office is where you control the day-to-day operations of the business.<br/><br/>The game board shows a floor plan of the Pet Shop with all the departments and your office.  Inside the three main departments is a space for an employee token and a pet card.  In the office is a space for you and/or your Asst. Manage token.  In the Kennels there is a space for employee tokens and four pet cards.  The Sales floor has a space for employee tokens and four pet cards.  There is another building next to the Pet Shop that has a Temp Agency and an Employee Training office.  This building is used to hire new employees: contractors and Professionals.  The Employee training office takes in your contractors and trains them to be a Specialist as a Veterinarian, Groomer, or Trainer yet they are not as proficient as the true Professionals.  On the outside game border is a sidewalk with 30 spaces that represents a turn track to keep track of the 30 days you're in business.  In the middle of the board is the Reputation track to keep track of your businesses reputation.<br/><br/>The game play is worker placement with a countdown 30 day turn tracker.  You will collect new animals or abandoned strays into your kennels but are limited to three spaces within the kennel to hold the pets, so picking the right animal is critical.  You the owner must decide which department is most important to change the new pet into money making breeds!  Each animal has a large, medium or small breed and only certain departments can be used to help improve the animals for sales.

Have you already had a crack at pitching a project and failed? If so, this is the book for you!

Within these pages, I've distilled my 14 years of experience in the gaming industry. I don't explain the esoteric, maddening mysteries of grammar, the hidden truths of sentence construction or the terrifying secrets of crafting a compelling story. I don&rsquo;t talk about game design. You can get that all elsewhere. Instead I give you practical advice on how to work professionally, pitch to publishers and secure reoccurring work.<br/><br/>I've endeavoured to keep the advice herein as system neutral as possible. While my writing experience is exclusively with Dungeons &amp; Dragons and the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, the principles, tips and tactics within this book work with any game system.<br/><br/>Why You Should Take My Advice<br/><br/>In short, I've been around the block.<br/><br/>I've been on both sides of the designer/publisher fence. In 1999, I started out as a hungry, wildly inexperienced and tremendously naive freelancer. Now, I'm a grizzled (nay veteran) publisher and editor who has written, edited and developed well in excess of 1,000,000 words of gaming content. I've written for big and small publishers alike and won an ENnie for Madness at Gardmore Abbey (2012 [Silver], Best Adventure). A partial list of my design credits includes: Wizards of the Coast (Monster Manual V, Exemplars of Evil, Madness at Gardmore Abbey), Paizo Publishing (Dragon Magazine and Dungeon Magazine), Expeditious Retreat Press (Legacy of Darkness, Plague), Kobold Press (Deep Magic), Rite Pubishing (Pathways magazine, Adventure Quarterly) and Raging Swan Press (Retribution, Shadowed Keep on the Borderlands, The Sunken Pyramid).<br/><br/>During my early freelance days I was very lucky to have a mentor of sorts. Stephen Radney-MacFarland at the time was the RPGA's Big Cheese and my Living Greyhawk boss. During the course of the campaign, he gave me countless pointers and pieces of advice on how to commission, edit and develop modules. He gave me tremendous insights into the design process both in the campaign and at Wizards of the Coasts. (Luckily, he also didn't strangle me despite serious provocation on several occasion). During my time on the campaign I worked on over 100 modules and wrote another 20 or so myself. I had a lot of time to practise his suggestions.<br/><br/>In 2010, I founded Raging Swan Press and have built it into one of the most successful, prolific and recognised publishers of Pathfinder compatible products in the multiverse. I've worked closely with dozens of freelancers and to date (November 2013), have released over 160 supplements, adventures and player aids.<br/><br/>I want to share with you the insights and advice I've received over the years. I was lucky enough to have a mentor, but you might not.<br/><br/>"}, "163334": {"rpgdesigner": ["Wolfgang Baur", "Steve Winter"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Printer-Friendly PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Hoard of the Dragon Queen (D&D Encounters)", "rpgartist": ["Jared Blando", "Aaron H\u00fcbrich", "Tyler Jacobson", "Guido Kuip", "Marcel Mercado", "Bryan Syme"], "rpgproducer": ["Wolfgang Baur", "Miranda Horner", "Marc Radle"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2094687.png", "usersrated": "5", "rpgsetting": ["Forgotten Realms"], "average": "7.2", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (5th Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Wizards of the Coast", "Kobold Press"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["DDEN - D&D Encounters", "Tyranny of Dragons"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2094687_t.png", "description": "From the Introduction:<br/><br/>Welcome to a special introductory edition of the Hoard of the Dragon Queen adventure, designed specifically for D&amp;D Encounters (an official in-store play program) and the D&amp;D Adventurers League (the official D&amp;D organized play system).<br/><br/>This edition of the adventure is designed for 1st- through 3rd-level characters, and is divided up into three episodes of play.

This is the main theme of the &ldquo;Heike Monogatari&rdquo;, a gunkimono (war tale) that gives a highly romanticized account of the war and the times that surrounded it. The book details the rise and fall of the Taira warrior house, the losing side at Dannoura. It drives home the point that &ldquo;all that flourishes must fall&rdquo; and that in a world of impermanence even the mighty are eventually reduced to &ldquo;dust before the wind&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a very fitting title, as the battle effectively ended the Taira's reign as a political and military powerhouse.<br/><br/>It has several sub-titles that change according to the game component-the full name is Shogyoumujou: Genpei Arasoi- Setouchi No Koubou-Genpei Saigo No Kassen-Dannoura No Tatakai (\u8af8\u884c\u7121\u5e38: \u6e90\u5e73\u306e\u4e89\u3044-\u702c\u6238\u5185\u306e\u653b\u9632-\u6e90\u5e73\u6700\u5f8c\u306e\u5408\u6226-\u58c7\u30ce\u6d66\u306e\u6226\u3044). This mouthful of a name translates as &ldquo;Impermanence Of All Things: Genpei Strife-Offense And Defense Of The Seto Inland Sea-End of the Genpei War-Battle of Dannoura.<br/><br/>The game features the naval forces of the Taira and Minamoto warrior houses and their assorted allies. In a strange design decision, the historical situation is somewhat reversed-the Minamoto are severely outnumbered but have stronger units than their Taira foes (the Minamoto substantially outnumbered the Taira but the crews of the Taira ships were far more experienced at sea warfare as the clan first came to power by demonstrating their prowess at fighting pirates). Perhaps this was done to reflect the Minamoto&rsquo;s lack of seaborne experience (the reduced numbers) but to show their large advantage in tactics (the increased strength)-their commander, Minamoto no Yoshitsune, purportedly ordered his archers to fire upon the rowers of the boats rather than the enemy soldiers (a violation of the unwritten rules of warfare of the day, something that Yoshitsune was notorious for throughout his career). While the game is relatively simple, it has lots of chrome rules that add historical flavor such as the effects of the changing tide on movement and combat, possession of the Imperial Regalia and the Child Emperor Antoku (both initially held by the Taira), defections, the role of leaders, and giving the Taira a couple of unique ship types. Historically, the Minamoto literally used the &lsquo;turning of the tide&rsquo; to rout the Taira and were aided by key defections during the battle as well as Yoshitsune&rsquo;s less than &lsquo;honorable&rsquo; tactics. The Taira leader, Munemori, was fished out of the ocean (where he had been thrown by an ally disgusted at his reluctance to commit suicide to avoid capture and dishonor) and eventually executed. However, the Taira denied the Minamoto a complete victory when the matriarch of the clan and her attendants jumped into the ocean with the child Emperor and the Imperial Regalia. While the Minamoto managed to recover two of the three artifacts, the child Emperor died and the sword Kusanagi was lost forever. This was a major disappointment to the Minamoto&rsquo;s alleged supporter, Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa. The game&rsquo;s victory conditions reflect all this, factoring both the Emperor/Regalia and enemy losses into the mix. It&rsquo;s a fast (10 turns, a couple of hours) and fun play with a manageable amount of units and good balance.<br/><br/>"}, "163345": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "The AnalogXP (Issue 2 - Jul 2014)", "rpgdesigner": ["Marcelo Cassaro", "Vin\u00edcius \"Encho\" Chagas", "Thiago Edwardo", "Danilo Kobold", "Marcelo Rodrigues (I)", "Ant\u00f4nio S\u00e1 Neto"], "rpgproducer": ["Vin\u00edcius \"Encho\" Chagas"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2440594.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["The Analog XP"], "rpgissuearticle": ["A note from the editor...", "Ant\u00f4nio S\u00e1 Interview", "Brigade of Four", "Danilo Kobold Interview", "Indie v Mainstream", "Marcelo Cassaro Interview", "Marcelo Rodrigues Interview", "So What's The Difference?", "Thiago Edwardo Interview", "This Issue Guests Throughout Brazil"], "rpgpublisher": ["Capital dos Jogos"], "rpgissueversion": ["English PDF version", "Portuguese PDF version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2440594_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>In this issue:<br/><br/>     Indie v Mainstream: Authors and Publishers from many generations talk about it.

The game is developed by the SNK-Games team in close cooperation with fans of the series.<br/><br/>The biggest of the improved features is a new scenario dedicated to the pirates threatening the galaxy. While the Coalition spends all of its resources to fight the Dominators (sentient machines who seek to eradicate all life), the pirates have united under the banner of a mysterious leader. Under this new master they have begun their own guerilla war to seize power in the weakened Galaxy. Players can now choose with whom to deal, the Dominators or the pirates, or both at the same time. If you choose the latter path, you will receive new story and side quests, new goals and promotions. After winning one of the wars, you can either finish the game or continue playing to win another.<br/><br/>Players begin their pirate career as the lowest of the low, and will make their way to the top of the pirate hierarchy, completing story missions and learning new information about the organization and its unknown leader whose actions threaten the very existence of the Coalition of sentient species. All player actions affect what kind of place the Galaxy will be at the end, with the victorious Coalition that managed to overcome its enemies or with a collapsed alliance from both external Dominator and internal pirate pressures.<br/><br/>The game has received a major technical overhaul in addition to the addition of new content. All of the main menu, loading screens, planet and space station vistas were reworked. Now you can choose a display resolution of up to 1920&times;1200 and planetary battles employ modern render technologies.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "163404": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2153677.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Matthew Hickman", "Stephanie Palermo"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Matthew Hickman"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Shark & Shark Games"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2153677_t.png", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Card Game", "Environmental"], "description": "In Flocks &amp; Flyways, the goal is to collect the most Migration Tokens by creating and migrating Flocks of Birds south for the winter to warmer feeding grounds. Players will need to strategically navigate crowded Flyways and catch Strong Tailwinds while avoiding dangerous Predators, Fog and other hazards. The player with the most Migration Tokens when there are no tokens remaining wins the game.<br/><br/>Gameplay Overview:<br/><br/>Each turn is comprised of three phases:<br/><br/>1) Draft Cards and Play Complete Flocks:<br/><br/><br/>    Each player may draft either two Birds or one Action from the Feeding Grounds. <br/><br/><br/><br/>    If a player is able to play a complete Flock(s), it may be played in any vacant, valid Flyway for that Bird type. A player may play as many complete Flocks from her hand during her turn. A player is not required to play a full Flock even if there is an open Flyway. <br/>            For example, a player may want to hold onto a complete Flock to create an even larger Flock for more points.<br/>        <br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>    After drafting cards and playing any Flocks, that player refills the Feeding Grounds back up to six cards to signal her turn is complete. If the draw pile is empty, reshuffle the discard pile to form a new draw pile.<br/><br/><br/><br/>2) Play Actions: After each player has had the opportunity to draft and play Flocks, beginning with the person with the player one token, each player may play one Action from her hand.<br/><br/>3) Migrate: Starting with Pacific Flyway, moving in order towards the Eastern Flyway, place one Migration Token on each Flock currently in play, unless prohibited by an Action (i.e. Fog).<br/><br/><br/>    If the number of tokens on the Flock is equal to the Migration Time printed on the card, the Flock owner collects all Migration Tokens currently on the Flock and the Flock is then discarded. Full Flock Bonus: The owner of the Flock receives +1 additional Migration Token from the pile for each additional Bird over the required Flock size. Safety in numbers!<br/><br/><br/>After the Migrate phase is complete, all players must discard down to the hand limit of ten cards. The player one token is then passed clockwise, shifting the starting player for the new turn. Refill the Feeding Grounds and continue play until all Migration Points are expended.<br/><br/>Winning the Game<br/><br/>    When the last token is played on a Flock, the game ends immediately. Any Migration Tokens on Flocks in a Flyway go to the owner of those Flocks.

To start play, lay out all of the patches at random in a circle and place a marker directly clockwise of the 2-1 patch. Each player takes five buttons &mdash; the currency/points in the game &mdash; and someone is chosen as the start player.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the spool or passes. To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, move the spool to that patch's location in the circle, add the patch to your game board, then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch. You're free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn't overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.<br/><br/>In addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you earn &quot;button income&quot;: sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board, then take this many buttons from the bank.<br/><br/>What's more, the time track depicts five 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place five actual 1x1 patches on these spaces. Whoever first passes a patch on the time track claims this patch and immediately places it on his game board.<br/><br/>Additionally, the first player to completely fill in a 7x7 square on his game board earns a bonus tile worth 7 extra points at the end of the game. (Of course, this doesn't happen in every game.)<br/><br/>When a player takes an action that moves his time token to the central square of the time track, he takes one final button income from the bank.

As in Venice, the islands of Murano are separated by canals, so gondolas and transportation are at the heart of this game.<br/><br/>The game board depicts the islands of Murano, with the islands being divided up into building sites and walkways. Surrounding the islands is a series of action spaces, with gondolas being present in some number of them at the start of play. On a turn, you move one of the gondolas in the direction of play to an empty space, then take the action shown there. You can't pass another gondola while moving or land in an occupied space, but for a coin you can move a gondola that's in front of the gondola you want to move, and you can pay to move multiple gondolas, if needed.<br/><br/>Some actions place shops on the islands, with shops coming in different types. You mark a shop to show ownership, and when tourists show up later, they will shop at various stores depending on their proximity and the goods they offer. You also need to take actions to move your personal gondolas to islands so that you can take actions there.<br/><br/>Why are you doing all of this activity? To score victory point cards in hand, and actions on the board will let you gain additional VP cards to give you direction to your actions or let you profit from what you've already done.<br/><br/>You can also use some of the buildings to create glassworks, and those glassworks come into play on the VP cards, through tourist sales, and via an action space shown at the bottom of the game board image that lets you sell different types of glass for money.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "German first edition"], "average": "7.27846", "name": "Murano", "playingtime": "75", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Point to Point Movement", "Tile Placement", "Worker Placement"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["Murano: Promo Cards", "Murano: The Christmas Tree"], "usersrated": "1261", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Cities: Venice", "Country: Italy"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Ep. 16 \u2013 UnPub 5 and Roll for the Galaxy | Podcast of Nonsensical Gamers", "Episode 48- Murano and Wisdom Check 2", "Episode 81-- Gen Con 2014 Top 11 to Try and Top 11 to Buy with special gues W.

These experiments resulted in the creation of human Psionic talents and the discovery of a mysterious energy, connected to living beings, named the Aether, allowing specially trained Adepts to manipulate reality through will alone.

Many Pathfinder products have embraced the science fiction genre, and as a result there are lots of GMs who may find themselves wanting to make use of the numerous ray guns, personal shields, power armors, teleportation chambers, and more that are the hallmarks of science fiction. But while sci-fi and fantasy may have turned out to be a combination much like peanut butter and chocolate, there&rsquo;s one aspect of the Pathfinder game that has never before been combined with sci-fi, and that is the realm of mythic power.<br/><br/>This book introduces eight sci-fi themed magic items created by the zogot, an ancient race of spacefaring creatures that discovered how to harness mythic power eons ago, and used it to power a mighty interplanetary empire. While the zogot vanished long ago, many of their relics can still be found today. Ride in style in a zogot force chariot, or trade in your battered full-plate for an ancient zogot power suit. Ray guns, stealth units, transporters, and more are all included in this book, as well as the mysterious zogot mythic power chamber, which can give a temporary boost of mythic power to creatures that use it, and is rumored to even be able to transform a normal creature into a mythic one!<br/><br/>"}, "163463": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2558578.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Chr\u00e9tien", "Simon Jutras", "Jean-Gabriel Lebel", "Vincent Petit"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "8", "age": "12", "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "ZenGame"], "boardgameintegration": ["Elites", "Elites"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2558578_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Adventure", "Civilization", "Economic", "Fantasy", "Industry / Manufacturing", "Racing", "Real-time", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration"], "description": "In a futuristic world where humans are established in several galaxy, a large magnetic storm hit the galaxy Virgo, destroying most of the high end technology.

If you cannot play a card you must draw a card and if you still cannot play you pass to<br/>the next player.<br/><br/>Plundering<br/> (playing red cards)<br/>when you play a red plunder card you place it in the discard pile and declare who you are stealing treasure from. <br/>   Then you can take the number of treasure cards indicated on the card 1,2,3, or 5 from the player and place it in your hoard unless they play a green defense card.<br/>    If a player has less treasure than you would take with your red plunder card you can still play that card and just take what treasure they do have.<br/><br/>Defending     <br/>(playing green cards)<br/>when another player tries to steal treasure from your hoard with a red card you can play one of the green cards into the discard pile to defend yourself.<br/>    You can play the dodge card to avoid having to give up any treasure. You can play the block card which requires you to give half the treasure owed rounded down. So if they played a cutlass that steals 1 you give nothing and if they were to play a blunderbuss which steals 3 you would give the one. You can also play the bribe card which causes you to discard a card in addition to the bribe card to avoid having to give up any treasure. If you do not have a card to discard you cannot play a bribe card. <br/>   You can play defense cards any time someone plays<br/>a red plunder card against you and does not count as your turn. with the exception of the special treasure chest card.<br/><br/>Special<br/>(blue cards) <br/>The blue cards are special cards you can play on your turn by putting them in the discard pile for its effect.<br/>    When you play the treasure chest card you draw three cards then your turn is over.<br/>  When you play the ruby card you put it in front of you like you would a treasure except the ruby card is worth two. Ruby cards can not be stolen. So if you had three regular treasure cards and  a ruby and someone played a cannon against you that steals 5 you would give them the three regular treasures but do not have to give them the ruby. <br/>    When you play the swift card you may play two more cards from your hand and then your turn is over. These can be any combination of yellow, red, or blue cards<br/>    .If you use a swift to play two attack cards on the same player you must play both at once and the number of cards to be stolen would be added together and count as a single attack. This means the player can defend with only one green card against the total of the attack. For instance if you were attacking for a total of 8 with two cards and they played a block, they would give four and if the played a dodge they would give nothing. If you use a swift to attack two separate people they count as two separate attacks and must be blocked separately.<br/><br/>When all the cards in the deck have been played shuffle the discard pile and flip it over and use it as the deck to continue play.<br/><br/>"}, "163465": {"poll": [], "name": "Flames of War Great War: World War One Battles", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2014", "boardgameexpansion": ["Flames of War: The World War II Miniatures Game"], "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2475127_t.jpg", "average": "7.33333", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Battlefront Miniatures Ltd"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2475127.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Great War"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Great War is Battlefront's expansion of their Flames of War rules, adapting them from WW2 to reflect combat in WW1, specifically focusing on 1918.<br/><br/>The rules are provided as a 37 page supplement that requires the 3rd edition core FoW rulebook in order to use.

The competing Daimyos direct their Samurai through the palace following some simple rules and quickly see that they can use the Samurai of the other Daimyos for their purposes. An exciting interwoven competition - with unexpected surpises.<br/><br/>Takamatsu is a game of conflict and cooperation, with players trying to place (or not place!) their samurai in their own rooms. The palace consists of two circular paths that merge at one point, then separate once again. Players have 5-7 samurai that are split between two color-coded rooms at the start of the game, and a row of scoring cards &mdash; some face-down &mdash; are laid out next to the board.<br/><br/>On a turn, you choose a room that contains at least one of your samurai, then you move some number of samurai in this room clockwise from this space.

When a room has three or more samurai, he must leave at least one behind (while still needing to bring at least one opposing samurai along, if any). When a samurai ends movement in a room of the same color, that samurai's daimyo collects the topmost scoring card, with multiple scorings being possible on a turn. For each open scoring card collected, the player immediately adjusts his scoring marker &mdash; which could move you back on the track, so sometimes you want to escort another samurai to his pad instead of bringing him to your place.<br/><br/>When one player reaches twenty points, players finish the round, then tally their hidden scoring cards, if any. The player with the most points wins! (With two players, each daimyo controls two colors of samurai and must move an opposing samurai when possible.
