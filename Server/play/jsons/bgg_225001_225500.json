It consists of two numbered decks each of 50 cards. One of these decks has Sentence cards, each with six numbered sentences; the other deck has the matching Master cards, showing the proper pronunciation of each difficult word in the sentences.<br/><br/>The rules provide several variations of the game. In the most basic, the Social Game, each deck is distributed evenly among the players. In turn, each player calls out the number of a Master card in his hand. The player holding the corresponding Sentence card then must slowly and distinctly read the sentence on that card of the Master's choice. If the Master player notices any mistakes, he must confirm what the Sentence player said, and then claims the pair of cards as a &quot;book&quot;; if he notices no mistakes, then the reading player gets the cards. Play then passes to the left, and the player with the most &quot;books&quot; when the cards run out is the winner.<br/><br/>The deck includes an Arbiter card, with whoever holds it being empowered to decide any disputes. In the Commercial game, the Arbiter card initially counts as a single point, and failed cards go to the Arbiter and count to his score. However, if the Arbiter makes a mistake, the Arbiter card goes to the successful Master player, and its value increases by one.<br/><br/>In the Professional game, the number of points won is equal to the number of test words correctly pronounced rather than the number of cards; a player missing even a single word scores nothing while the Master gets all the points for the sentence. This introduces an element of strategy for Masters: whether to challenge a given Reader with a long and difficult sentence that could mean a big swing one way or the other, or to choose a short and easier one with less risk and less reward.

A century after the end of the world, men still live, between reconstruction and the persistence of the past.<br/><br/>The catastrophe has profoundly changed the world. Most of the coastal towns were simply swept away, while winter and epidemics mowed the largest number. Since then, the world is no longer the same as before. The climate was upset, life gradually took over.<br/><br/>In Europe, where action takes place, the extremes are at the rendezvous, between a rough winter and a hot summer. Powerful states have managed to reconstitute themselves, such as the Restored European Community (on the lands of Northeast France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands ...), Die Federation Europa (Germany), and Other smaller states: the Republics of Brittany, the Alliance of Burgundy, the Federation of the Three Lakes, and so on.<br/><br/>It would be wrong to believe that the social aspect of a post-apocalyptic universe comes down to Mad Max. In Ash, men have had time to rebuild and develop new communities, even though many of them are precarious and delivered to looters. Religion plays an equally primordial role, with the presence of two fiercely opposed and competing apostolic Catholic churches: one centered in Avignon and the other in Ravenna (Italy). Druidism is also represented with a dogma after the disaster, Buddhism with the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, Islam, Judaism and various sects, sometimes dangerous.<br/><br/>In this highly contrasting world, where some regions have succeeded in rehabilitating infrastructures worthy of the 20th century and others have reverted to the middle-ages, the characters can be particularly diverse.<br/><br/>"}, "225341": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3541902.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Beau Beckett", "Jeph Stahl"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2017", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Jarek Noco\u0144", "Steve Paschal"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Academy Games", "ASYNCRON games"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3541902_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Age of Reason", "American Indian Wars", "Card Game", "Educational", "Wargame"], "description": "15 cards plus 2 cards of rules that add a Native Alliance power to each faction in the game.

With the improvised storytelling of a roleplaying game and the pick-up-and-play nature of a card game, you can jump right into things and tell a great story together over the space of a few hours.<br/><br/>The deck includes 5 characters: the flighty Gadabout, the dependable Servant, the conniving Aged Relative, the imperious Pillar of Society, and the eccentric Highbrow. Players each pick a character and customise them by choosing ability cards, relationships with the other characters, and cosmetic details (name, appearance, personality etc). Then the group drafts Goals and Assets for each character - these are the objectives they're trying to achieve, and the resources they have to try to do that.<br/><br/>Play then starts, with each player taking it in turn to play through a short scene of their character working towards their goal while the other characters help, interfere, or push their own agendas. Within scenes, characters can activate special abilities to do things like revealing an incredibly expensive possession, providing another character with a refreshing cocktail, or fixing someone with an imperious gaze that forces them to reveal their secrets. These are all paid for with a limited pool of tokens, meaning players must carefully plan when they use their abilities to guide the story in their preferred direction.<br/><br/>As characters make progress on their goals they accumulate special tokens they can cash in for an all-or-nothing attempt to complete the goal. Once someone has completed all their goals, the game wraps up with an epilogue showing how things worked out for each character.<br/><br/>(Source: publisher website)<br/><br/>User Note: This game also has a board game entry: What Ho, World!<br/><br/>"}, "225356": {"rpgdesigner": ["Marc W.

At that time, we attempted a lecture/discussion course on Charles Darwin and his World, only to find ourselves spending an inordinate amount of time defending the theory of evolution from the criticisms of intelligent design and young earth advocates. Our efforts to encourage students to suspend judgment until they at least understood the basic tenets of the theory met with a rather discouraging rate of failure. Our one surprising success resulted from the unusual final exam, during which our students attended a salon in the role of historical characters from Darwin&rsquo;s time. When dressed and addressed as nineteenth century intellectuals, these students demonstrated a heretofore hidden ability to speak knowledgably about Darwin and his impact on the world. We had accidentally slipped into the world of Reacting to the Past.<br/><br/>Once we became acquainted with the Reacting to the Past series, we realized that The Origin of Species would admirably serve as a primary text for a reacting game, and that the Royal Society&rsquo;s three year conflict over granting Darwin the Copley Medal provided an excellent decision point. The richness of the paradigm shifts occurring during the mid-19th Century adds immeasurably to the complexity of the game. Social, political, economic, religious, and scientific changes interact with each other to make this game a challenge for even the most sophisticated students. Because of the complexity of the issues in the game, we strongly suggest that Charles Darwin, the Copley Medal, and the Rise of Naturalism be used as an advanced game. We use the game with freshman students, but only after they have experienced at least one other reacting game.<br/><br/>"}, "225379": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Rituals of the Fey", "rpgdesigner": ["Alex Riggs", "Joshua Zaback"], "rpgproducer": ["Rosa Gibbons"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3509830.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Necromancers of the Northwest"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Weekly Wonders"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3509830_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Enchanted Magic of the Fair Folk<br/><br/>Occult rituals, from Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Occult Adventures, bring magic to the masses, with lengthy and difficult to perform magical rites which can be performed even by non-spellcasters, but which come with a cost, as well as the risk for terrible backlash to occur for those who meddle in things they do not understand.

This game provides perhaps the finest evocation of such issues in the modern world, in large part because the leaders of India in 1945 were themselves outstanding: Mohandas Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Bhim Rao Ambedkar, and others at the time wrote voluminously and well.<br/><br/>The excellence of the leaders, however, makes the dismal outcome all the more perplexing.<br/><br/>"}, "225397": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Gamemaster News Service, 1947: Partition", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3511051.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Defining a Nation: India on the Eve of Independence, 1945"], "rpgpublisher": ["W.

Thomas More is named as Wolsey&rsquo;s replacement. More presides over Parliament, which the king hopes will somehow find the means to invalidate his marriage, thus freeing him to marry his new love, Lady Anne Boleyn. Apart from matters of the heart, matters of state also apply, for Henry has no male heir to carry on the Tudor line, and Queen Catherine has passed her child-bearing years.<br/><br/>But will Parliament be content with solving the king&rsquo;s marital and dynastic problems? For there are some in Parliament who wish to use the royal divorce to disempower the English church, to sever its ties to papal Rome, and to change it doctrinally from Catholicism to Protestantism. Others are against the divorce, against supremacy and independence, and against this heretical creed filtering in from the Continent. More is their leader, for as long as he can survive. Thomas Cromwell leads the king&rsquo;s party.<br/><br/>The king is ambivalent about the reformation unleashed by his &ldquo;great matter,&rdquo; as the divorce campaign is called, and so the conservatives are free to prosecute reformers as heretics, while the reformers are free to prosecute conservatives as traitors. Victory is up for grabs, because the king&rsquo;s party is in fact a coalition of three dissimilar factions whose members are further divided by personal ambitions and jealousies. At issue is the clash of four contending ideas: medieval Catholicism, Lutheranism, Renaissance humanism, and Machiavellian statecraft.<br/><br/>"}, "225400": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Henry VIII and the Reformation Parliament: Instructor's Guide", "rpgdesigner": ["J.

Players can roll as fast as possible to create roll combinations and control cards faster then their opponents. Once a card is controlled it can always be taken away from the opponent. Once a player controls four cards the game is over.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY:<br/>7 cards are laid out in a row. each player takes their dice pool card and places it in front of them. Each player gets four d6 dice &quot;white for player 1 and black for player 2&quot;. There is an extra die color red that can be gathered as cards are controlled and used to help create dice combination to control cards. This die will change ownership often. The players will roll their dice and place them on the cards they want to control. Once you roll the required dice combo you can control the card and turn it 90 degrees. Each card owned is worth victory points [1,1,3,3,5,5,10] at the end when four cards are controlled you add up your victory points and the high score wins. Tactics come in when you have to decide which cards you can control and earn enough points to win. You only need 1 point greater than your opponent to win and once you get your fourth card you need to make sure your points are higher than your opponent. Control changes a lot in this game and since each player is rolling their dice fast you have to keep an eye on which cards your opponent is placing dice on to try and control them. When a card is controlled a player can roll a small dice combination to turn the card back 90 degrees and remove your control but they don't control the card either until they roll the required combination.<br/><br/>"}, "225427": {"rpgdesigner": ["Stephen Chenault"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "statistics": [], "name": "Guilds & Orders", "rpgartist": ["Robert Bradley", "Malcolm David Monette"], "rpgproducer": ["Mark Sandy"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3511890.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Softcover Version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Troll Lord Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3511890_t.png", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>Guilds and Orders is a simple resource guide for use at almost any table and any roleplaying game.

Players each pick a character and customise them by choosing ability cards, relationships with the other characters, and cosmetic details (name, appearance, personality etc). Then the group drafts Goals and Assets for each character &ndash; these are the objectives they&rsquo;re trying to achieve, and the resources they have to try to do that.<br/><br/>Play then starts, with each player taking a turn to play through a short scene of their character working towards their goal while the other characters help, interfere, or push their own agendas. Within scenes, characters can activate special abilities to do things like revealing an incredibly expensive possession, providing another character with a refreshing cocktail, or fixing someone with an imperious gaze that forces them to reveal their secrets. These are all paid for with a limited pool of tokens, meaning players must carefully plan when they use their abilities to guide the story in their preferred direction.<br/><br/>As characters make progress on their goals they accumulate special tokens they can cash in for an all-or-nothing attempt to complete the goal.

The game can be played with any Pairs playing card deck, but was specially designed and introduced with the Bar Maids deck.<br/><br/>Players: 2 to 7 (including one dealer)<br/><br/>You Need: A Pairs deck, and chips or coins for gambling.<br/><br/>Flow of Play: Rocket is structured as a casino table game.<br/><br/>All players are playing against the dealer (not each other), and the dealer plays by fixed rules.   In a home game, players should take turns being the dealer. There is a slight advantage for the dealer, so the game is only fair when the deal passes around the table.<br/><br/>The Deck: You can play Rocket with a single Pairs deck, or up to 8 Pairs decks shuffled together. The deck should be reshuffled when approximately 20% remains.<br/><br/>The Bet: To begin, each player must place a bet. Different players can bet different amounts. A bet must be divisible by 10 units, because all payouts will be based on 1/10 of the bet. The dealer agrees to cover bets of any size, up to a maximum bet agreed upon by all players.<br/><br/>The Starting Deal: Deal one card face up to each player, and then to the dealer. Play begins on the dealer&rsquo;s left.<br/><br/>Using a Button: Casinos may wish to start each hand with the low card,rather than on the dealer&rsquo;s left. In this case, use a button to designate the starting position, and break ties by choosing the player closest to the left of the previous button (rather than by dealing an extra card). Under these rules, the dealer still acts last.<br/><br/>Player&rsquo;s Turn: Each player is playing against the dealer only. In turn, players may either fold or hit. All players act before the dealer.<br/><br/>Folding: When you fold (similar to surrender in blackjack), you are paying to get out of the game. Pay the dealer a fraction of your bet, which is 1/10 of the total bet multiplied by the lowest card in either your stack or the dealer&rsquo;s.<br/> For example, if your bet is 20 coins, and the lowest card between you and the dealer is a 4, you can fold by paying 2 x 4 = 8 coins. You retrieve the remainder of your bet.<br/><br/>Hitting: When you hit, you are staying in, and trying not to get a pair. Take one card, faceup. If you don&rsquo;t pair up, you are safe. If you get a pair, you lose, and must pay that number, multiplied by 1/10 of your bet. For example, if you have bet 20 coins and get a pair of 8&rsquo;s, you pay 2 x 8 = 16 coins.<br/><br/>Dealer&rsquo;s Turn: The dealer always acts last, and plays by a diff erent set of rules:<br/><br/>Dealer Must Hit: Th e dealer always hits (she cannot fold).<br/><br/>Dealer Pair: When the dealer catches a pair, she pays all surviving players that amount, multiplied by 1/10 of their bet.<br/>For example, if the dealer catches 7-7, and your bet was 50, the dealer pays you 5 x 7 = 35 coins. (You also keep your bet.)<br/><br/>Death Card: A 3 is sudden death for the dealer. The dealer loses immediately if she gets a 3, even on her first card. Th is pays all bets at 3/10 (as if the dealer caught a pair of 3&rsquo;s). Note: A 3 is not lethal to players, only the dealer.<br/><br/>Continuing: If the dealer doesn&rsquo;t pair up or catch a 3, play resumes with the first player. The game continues until all players either catch a pair or fold, or until the dealer pairs up or catches a 3.<br/><br/>"}, "225458": {"poll": [], "name": "Magnaci: O santa piva di Polonia!", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Auction/Bidding", "Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "2016", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Country: Poland", "Crowdfunding: Wspieram"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["PHALANX"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Novel-based", "Political", "Renaissance"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "Bonus card added to first issue of Kurier Planszowy.<br/><br/>"}, "225459": {"poll": [], "name": "Pingwiny z Madagaskaru: Oficer X", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Modular Board", "Set Collection", "Worker Placement"], "yearpublished": "2017", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3522319_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["PHALANX"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3522319.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Polish first edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Children's Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Miniatures", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Bonus card added to second issue of Kurier Planszowy.<br/><br/>"}, "225460": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Christian Delcourt", "Philippe Delcourt"], "poll": [], "name": "Leader Foot", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Grid Movement", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Simulation"], "yearpublished": "1993", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ferriot Cric"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Sports"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Realistic football (soccer) simulation using magnetic board and pawns.<br/>3 difficulty levels give a gameplay from a simple family game to real pedagogic and professional simulation.<br/><br/>With the first level of difficulty, each player gets a maximum of 5 actions per turn and must choose between attack, defense, shooting attempt, shooting, shooting defense and goalkeeper.<br/><br/>A special dice thrown give the result of each action and let the players know if it result with a goal or not after the succeded actions were simulated moving the pawns and the ball directely on the board.<br/><br/>The second and third levels of difficulty add more specifics and complex rules to the first ones by introducing real professional and international rules as corner, free-kick, offside, penalty and throw in.<br/><br/>Each player get 1 minute for its turn and the game can be set for 1 ou 2 45 minutes half times.<br/><br/>As a real soccer match, the best goal scored player is the winner.<br/><br/>"}, "225461": {"poll": [], "name": "Pingwiny z Madagaskaru: Roy", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Modular Board", "Set Collection", "Worker Placement"], "yearpublished": "2017", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3522237_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["PHALANX"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3522237.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Polish first edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Children's Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Miniatures", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Bonus card added to second issue of Kurier Planszowy.<br/><br/>"}, "225462": {"rpgartist": ["Jorge Gomez Arrausi", "John Cason", "Melvin de Voor", "Hardy Fowler", "Jorge Gomez", "Alyssa Menold", "Iwo Widulinski"], "statistics": [], "name": "Wyrd Chronicles (Issue 29 -

Like the game itself, the narrative casts the reader into the adventure from a first person point of view, taking on the roles of the different characters in the story.<br/><br/>Gygax was the son of immigrants who grew up in Lake Geneva, WI, in the 1950s. An imaginative misfit, he escaped into a virtual world based on science fiction novels, military history and strategic games like chess. In the mid-1970s, he co-created the wildly popular Dungeons &amp; Dragons game. Starting out in the basement of his home, he was soon struggling to keep up with the demand. Gygax was a purist, in the sense that he was adamant that players use their imaginations and that the rules of the game remain flexible. A creative mind with no real knowledge of business, he made some strategic errors and had a falling out with the game's co-creator, his close friend and partner, David Arneson.<br/><br/>By the late 1970s the game had become so popular among kids that parents started to worry -- so much so that a mom's group was formed to alert parents to the dangers of role play and fantasy. The backlash only fueled the fires of the young fans who continued to play the game, escaping into imaginary worlds. Before long, D&amp;D conventions were set up around the country and the game inspired everything from movies to the first video games. With D&amp;D, Gygax created the kind of role playing fantasy that would fuel the multibillion dollar video game industry, and become a foundation of contemporary geek culture.<br/><br/>"}, "225012": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Demon Cults & Secret Societies (5e)", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3372323.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Kobold Press"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["(Upcoming Releases)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3372323_t.png", "description": "<br/><br/><br/>    <br/>        <br/>UNRELEASED GAME<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        <br/>This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future.

Become the President, General, or even King while you try to be the first to empty your hand of cards. Customize each game by mixing and matching the eight different government types (Monarchy, Military, Democracy, Communism, Theocracy, Plutocracy, Republic, and Anarchy).<br/><br/>Before starting the game, players choose which forms of government they want to use. Each governmental form features its own deck of color-coded number cards, event cards, law cards, wild cards, and government change cards. Combine the decks together and then deal each player 7 cards. The top card of the deck determines the starting government, and then on your turn, you play one card out of your hand that matches the color of the government in play. If it's a number card, play continues. If it's an event card, resolve the action on the card. Law cards have special actions that must be resolved according to the government in play (voting in a democracy or the first player deciding in a monarchy, for example). And government change cards force a shift to a new form of government. If you don't have a card to play, draw a new card and play passes to the next player. The game continues until one player has gotten rid of all his or her cards. You then score according to the number of cards left in your hand modified by the governments you led during the game.<br/><br/>Be sure to chose wisely when changing the governments because each one has special effects that can make it easier for you, or harder for your opponents, to win. Use the power of Communism to slow down the leader as you redistribute cards, or declare a Plutocracy and watch your lead get bigger with every turn. Move cards around in the deck in a Theocracy, and decide events together in a democracy.

Players take on the role of politicians and try to convince each other they, and they alone, can solve socio-political issues. If you enjoy debating fiscal responsibility one turn, and the feasibility of solving homelessness by imprisoning the homeless the next, The Debate is the game for you.<br/>Players begin by separating and shuffling the two decks &ndash; ISSUES and POLCIES. The issues deck should be placed face-down on the table, and each player takes five policy cards to form a hand. The youngest player starts as the dealer, and they turn over the top issue card. This represents a particular problem that all the players, as politicians, want to look like they can solve. Players do this by playing two Policy cards from their hand. Each player does this going clockwise around the group, starting with the player after the dealer. Each player plays his/her two cards and explains briefly (30ish seconds) how the two Policies they have played solve the particular issue.<br/>After each player has played his/her two Policies, players debate each other in a calm and collected fashion, gently critiquing each other&rsquo;s policies while defending their own. When that&rsquo;s done, go for the jugular &ndash; mercilessly attack your opponent&rsquo;s stupid policies, compare them unfavourably to your fiscally-sound utopian masterplan, and suggest they&rsquo;re like Hitler somehow. Maybe bite someone. When this is done, vote for a winner &ndash; the player whose Policies were the best. Remember to vote for the player who did the best at explaining, justifying and defending their Policies &ndash; not the player who suggested Policies closest to your personal ideology.<br/>Once you&rsquo;ve voted, take a note of the score and continue. The player to the left of the dealer becomes the new dealer, he or she deals two new policy cards to the player (bringing their hand back up to five), and turns over a new issue card. The whole horrible mess goes on like this until players either run out of issues or, if they want to reshuffle the issues and keep playing, until a pre-defined end time (or when you&rsquo;ve had enough). Then the player with the most points is declared winner.

We have provided pregenerated characters from all the available classes with a broad representation of available races. Also included is a new system of combat rules designed for modern weapons, rules for hacking, and a selection of gear and items. The document provides a number of scenarios designed for 4 or 5 characters. Get a feel for the classes and the rules. Most of all, enjoy yourselves.<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/><br/>As you read this book, you're going to realize Interface Zero 2.0 isn't a traditional cyberpunk setting.

The goal of the game is to collect more tokens than your opponent. Players collect token(s) when crossing the board starting from their base line and finishing - passing opponent&rsquo;s baseline. On their path to finish players can capture opponent&rsquo;s token(s).<br/><br/>Some definitions: 1. Tower &ndash; is a stack of two or more tokens; 2. Berd is a tower with two or more same color tokens on the top; 3.Unprotected tower or unprotected token (UT) &ndash; a single token or a tower that is not Berd. Unprotected tower moves like a single token. Players can capture opponent&rsquo;s token by landing on a square occupied by a single token or unprotected tower. You can&rsquo;t capture or land on a square occupied by your opponent&rsquo;s Berd. Players move their UT (unprotected token or Unprotected tower) one square at a time forward or lateral move. You can&rsquo;t move your UT diagonally or backward. While you can move your UT laterally however you can&rsquo;t do more than three consecutive side moves. A player can recover his/her captured token from opponent&rsquo;s unprotected tower by landing on that tower. In this case the player will restack tokens and place his/her tokens on the top creating a Berd. In order to play a token from the Berd you have to split the Berd and play a single token or unprotected tower. If there are captured opponent&rsquo;s tokens in the Berd they must be attached at least under one of your token; -so basically you move UT from your Berd. The game is over when only one player has active token(s) left on the board. Now players can stack their collected tokens and see whose tower is taller or who collected more tokens.<br/><br/>Variations of the game:<br/>1. Berd strategy game can be played on different size boards (3x3; 4x4; 5x5; 6x6) and/or with various number of tokens. Two sided board supplied in this game with 3x3 and 4x4 sides. Recommended to play with 5 tokens per each player on 3x3 and max 6 tokens on 4x4 board. <br/>2. Game with color protection &ndash; Players can use colored squares on the board for protection from being captured by the opponent&rsquo;s token. For example: Red color player&rsquo;s UT (single token or unprotected tower) will be protected on the Red square. Other rules are identical to the basic Berd game.<br/>3. Game with points &ndash; in this game each token assigned different weight/points (10; 20; 30; 40; 50 ..), shown on the token. This option of the game provides more possibilities for moves. The winner will be a player who collects higher total score. In order to play this version of the game you need to attach stickers with numbers. There are lines on the sides of the token for even attachment.<br/>4. Game with hidden points &ndash; games #1; 2 and 3 can be played with tokens that have hidden numbers (numbers are not displayed outside, they are attached inside). This game is similar to game #3 with the difference that only a player who possesses a token can see the weight of that token. This feature introduces more intrigue and uncertainty about the end result of the game.<br/><br/>"}, "225065": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["Hardcover Version"], "poll": [], "name": "On Aves' Path", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3501456.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Aventurien"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Ulisses North America"], "rpg": ["Das Schwarze Auge (DSA) (5th Edition)"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["(Upcoming Releases)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3501456_t.jpg", "description": "<br/><br/><br/>    <br/>        <br/>UNRELEASED GAME<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        <br/>This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future.

This spring, light-wielding thunderstorms roiled the valleys. Now, with summer come early and a glowing moon overhead, the soil is moist and black and delicious mushrooms are peeking up all over the forest. The Foray is on!<br/><br/>Morels Foray expands Morels with new items, characters, weather, a more dynamic forest, and unique systems enabling 2-4 players. 3p and 4p have slightly augmented decks, start players with a basket and sticks, and introduce &quot;peek cards&quot; placed beside the deck to show what's coming up in the forest (these cards enhance planning depth but are not immediately accessible).<br/><br/>Each player count also has unique facets. In 3p, players receive an optional (non-card acquisition) bonus action at the end of each turn. In 4p, a marker rotates clockwise to show who is the Priority Player on any given turn. Players select cards from the same forest simultaneously on a Compass, then reveal and resolve proceeding clockwise before resetting the forest and passing the Priority Marker. Deciphering playing styles and motives is helpful because having selected an option that is no longer available when you go to resolve requires altering your choice and incurs a penalty. This style of simultaneous play keeps a peppy pace with no down time and resembles a 2p Morels hallmark in evaluating what your opponents are likely to do and adjusting for optimal foraging.<br/><br/>At its heart, Morels Foray varies both the social and tactical texture of Morels. The new cards present fresh decisions and the opportunity for new strategies.  Weather cards (Rainstorm and Forest Fire) can decimate existing forests or spring up new ones, Items (Map, Shiitake Log) grant power with proper timing, Events (Farmers Market, Eureka!) enable big plays, Characters (Thief, Farm Girl, Eccentric, Chef) allow you to interact with the forest and your opponent(s) in new ways, and new mushrooms (Lion's Mane, Panther Cap) expand your foraging options in the ever beckoning forest.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "7.5", "name": "Morels Foray", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Set Collection"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Food / Cooking", "Mushrooms"]}, "225144": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Alexey Konnov", "Alexey Paltsev", "Anatoliy Shklyarov", "Trehgrannik"], "average": "8.66667", "poll": [], "name": "Magic Hat", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Memory"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3507520_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Masha Sergeeva"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Simple Rules"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3507520.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Children's Game", "Medieval", "Memory"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Magic Hat is a colourful memory game for the whole family!<br/><br/>What is it about?<br/><br/>Something disturbing happened in the Magic Kingdom!

Each round twenty of these tiles are placed at random around the perimeter of a large ship, and each player receives a hand of cards. On a turn, a player can play one or more cards to claim a tile following these rules:<br/><br/><br/>     If neither tile adjacent to the desired tile has been claimed, the player can lay down any card next to this tile, claim it, then place it in the leftmost space of the level of their spaceship that matches the number of the card played.

If the cards have different numbers, however &mdash; e.g., 1 and 3 &mdash; then you must lay down the same two numbers (1 and 3), one matching number and any other two cards, or any four cards. You place this tile on your spaceship in the same manner previously desired.<br/><br/><br/>Once everyone has no cards in hand or cannot play further, the round ends. Any remaining tiles are thrown away, then you reset the board and deal out a new hand of cards. After five rounds, players now deploy these tiles onto the new planet, each turn playing 1-3 of the leftmost tiles from the row of their choice to create their personal terraformed world. If you deploy a terrabot, which are labeled A-E, you start a new city with this letter or extend an existing city of yours. Material vessels, which come in five colors, can be delivered to the planet's surface only if attached to shuttles, and each city can have vessels of only a single color. Satellites provide bonus scoring when added to a city. Shuttles and satellites can also be used for shields to protect your newborn planet.<br/><br/>Players earn points during the first half of the game for picking up terrabots and having cards left in hand. During the second half, players score for deploying satellites and for meeting targets set at the start of the game, e.g. having a city with eight tiles in it, having a city of each letter, emptying a level on your spaceship, having a certain number of shields, etc.<br/><br/>Once all the spaceships are empty, players score their final points for how well they've developed each city and their shields in comparison with their fellow terraformers. Whoever scores the most points wins!<br/><br/>"}, "225164": {"poll": [], "name": "Card Clash", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2017", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3506396_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3506396.png", "boardgameversion": ["Print and Play first edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Fighting", "Print & Play"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "5", "description": "Description from the designer:<br/><br/>Card Clash is a quick game that sees 2 players attacking and counterattacking with cards whose type preference beats the previously played card.

As Supreme Leader, you will make all decisions on behalf of your nation to include:<br/><br/><br/>     The appointment (and removal) of cabinet ministers<br/>     The acceptance of foreign financing<br/>     The investment of resources into governmental sectors (Public Services, Industrial, Military, and Nuclear Weapons)<br/>     The compliance or disregard of UN mandates related to nuclear development <br/>     The oppression of society<br/>     The maintenance of diplomatic relations with historical allies<br/>     The application of bribery to cabinet ministers<br/>     The analysis of intelligence to make risk-based decisions<br/>     The issuance of threats against the West<br/><br/><br/>The primary objective will be for the player's regime to survive from 1953 through the year 2030.  The secondary objective will be to maximize adherence to the Juche ideology by progressively achieving national self-reliance.  Juche points are earned by advancing the primary indicators of Nationalism, Military Strength, Industrial Development, and Nuclear Weapons Development while minimizing lingering foreign debt.<br/><br/>The game is played over a series of 12 turns, each representing seven years of history.  Each turn consists of a series of steps:<br/><br/>Appoint New Cabinet Ministers:<br/>There are four major cabinet positions that will serve under your leadership:  Public Services Minister, Industry Minister, Defense Minister, and Atomic Development Minister.  Each minister is represented by one six-sided die which is rolled every four turns and assigned to an office.  The roll indicates the minister's skill level.  The higher a minister&rsquo;s skill level, the greater their level of performance (as well as their level of ambition to become the new Supreme Leader).<br/><br/>Gain Resources:<br/>Resource cubes are earned from three sources:  Industrial Production (which increases with the DPRK's level of Industrial Development); Foreign Support from Russia and China (according to the current status of Foreign Relations); and by obtaining loans (Foreign Debt) from allies.<br/><br/>Resolve Sanctions:<br/>Dice rolls are used to determine if the UN places (or increases) economic sanctions on the DPRK based on the DPRK's level of Nuclear Development.  The player must choose to either comply with the mandates by dismantling your nuclear program or ignore the mandates and have sanctions tightened.<br/><br/>Gather Intelligence--Determine High-Risk Events:<br/>The player gathers intelligence by rolling dice to determine which threat events are &quot;high risk&quot; in the current turn.  The probability of meeting a triggering condition grows as the severity of the situation increases.  Threat events include: High Value Target Strikes, Military Coups, Tactical Strikes, Famines, and Revolutions.<br/><br/>Budget Resources:<br/>The player now applies resources acquired in the Gain Resources phase to a number of investment areas:  Social economy investments; Industrial &amp; infrastructure investments; Defense investments; Research, Development, &amp; Testing investments; Diplomatic investment; Bribery; Purges; Heavy Oppression; and Foreign Debt repayment.  The Supreme Leader must choose wisely regarding how to best invest DPRK's limited resources.  Short-term decisions may have no long-term value other than to enhance your regime's chances of survival through the next turn.  Proper decision-making will require keen insight into the complex interaction of events that seek to defeat you.<br/><br/>Purge Appointees:<br/>The player has the option of purging one or more cabinet appointees.  This is done by re-rolling their die with the hope of gaining a minister with greater skill (if poor performance was an issue) or less skill (since too many highly skilled ministers pose a threat to your authority).<br/><br/>Run Economy:<br/>The combination of cabinet minister skill, resources applied, and die rolls are then used to resolve the effects of your decisions on your nation's economy.  This will result in adjustments to the primary governmental indicators (Nationalism, Industrial Development, Military Strength, and Nuclear Weapons development).  Increasing development in each sector will reward you with related economic and strategic advantages.  A struggling economy will introduce added risks.<br/><br/>Issue Threat<br/>If Nuclear Weapons Development is sufficiently advanced, the player may issue threats to the West and its allies which may result in certain strategic advantages.  Concessions (resources) may be gained from other countries in an effort to quell your sabre-rattling.  Your threats may impress and embolden your military leadership (mitigating the risk of Military Coup).  Your brinkmanship could discourage the West from considering an immediate Tactical Strike.<br/><br/>Adjust Regional Tensions:<br/>Regional tensions are adjusted based upon decisions made earlier in the turn and are increased due to:  The occurrence of major incidents; successful advances in your nuclear weapons program, and  Threats being issued.<br/><br/>Check/Resolve Foreign Relations:<br/>Resources applied to Diplomacy, the current level of Regional Tensions, and a die roll are used to resolve possible improvements (or further deterioration) in relations with Russia and China.  Ensuring strong ties will provide strategic advantages such as increased economic support and military protection.<br/><br/>Resolve High-Risk Events:<br/>Any threat events determined from the Intelligence phase to be &quot;high risk&quot; are now resolved.  Resolution is performed using the number of resources applied to mitigating investments and a die roll.  Effects could range from a foreign attack that diminishes the player's economic standing to the forceful removal of the player from power (ending the game).<br/><br/>Reset the Board:<br/>Assuming the regime has survived all high-risk event resolutions the board is reset for the next turn starting with the Appoint New Cabinet Ministers phase.  If the player's regime remains intact by the end of the final turn, the final Juche score is calculated from all economic indicators to determine your effectiveness as the Supreme Leader.<br/><br/>Rogue State has been entered in the 2016-17 Wargame Print and Play Contest.<br/><br/>"}, "225167": {"average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Human Punishment", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Take That", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2018", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Werewolf / Mafia"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3539116_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Grandfailure"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3539116.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Deduction", "Mafia", "Spies/Secret Agents"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Humans become lazy and create machines for their work.

You win by forming a group of connected cards of your color greater than your opponent&rsquo;s.<br/><br/>"}, "225208": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Rob Landeros"], "poll": [], "name": "7th Guest: The Board Game", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2018", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Trilobyte"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Puzzle", "Video Game Theme"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>In the world of The 7th Guest: The Board Game, you re-enter the mysterious and magical Stauf mansion, filled with diabolical puzzles, riddles and other mind games to test your wits and knowledge against your friends and family. But as with all haunted houses, know that you enter at your own risk. The goal is to emerge with your sanity - and your soul &ndash; intact.<br/><br/>The board game remains true to the original award winning computer game, although now you play the role of one of the six guests in direct competition with the other guests. Starting from the Foyer, you are randomly assigned destination rooms to which you must go, by roll of the Magic Die, and there, solve the mysteries and challenges within. Be the first to finish your tour of the mansion, arrive at the final destination, the Little Room at the Top, solve the final puzzle there, and you best your fellow guests and achieve your heart's most secret desire. Which, for one thing, is to best your fellow guests.<br/><br/>The puzzle types range from logic puzzles, to spatial problems, to riddles and cryptic clues to trivia. You never know what you'll get. Some may be easy, but some may be real brain freezers. But Stauf, being a fair-minded host, has provided up to three hints for the more difficult problems. But using the hints comes at a price, naturally. Nothing is free, you know. And in Stauf's world, no good deed goes unpunished.<br/><br/>(Note that whereas The 7th Guest and The 11th Hour had a little less than 90 logic puzzles &amp; brain teasers between them, the basic tabletop game comes with 300, and that's just for starters.)<br/><br/>And if you can't solve the puzzle put to you, the other guests will have a chance to &ldquo;steal&rdquo; it from you by answering it instead. So be vigilant and pay attention to not only your own puzzles, but to the puzzles put to your fellow guests. You might just walk away with the prize that was once within their grasp. How delicious is that?<br/><br/>It all sounds pretty simple and straightforward, doesn't it? Well, not quite so fast. Simple, maybe. But straightforward? That's not exactly the way of the diabolical game maker, who here, has devised a number of Mystery Spells that are cast upon his guests, making things just a little trickier... and lot more interesting. Should you land on a Mystery space, you might be sent someplace you don't want to be. Or, you might be assigned extra rooms to unlock. Or, somebody might gain the power to &ldquo;Steal&rdquo; the answer to your puzzle from right under your nose. Again, you never know what you're going to get. But Stauf is,if nothing else, an equal opportunity evil doer... so all those bad things that can be inflicted on you can be inflicted on your opponents too. And take heart... for every evil spell, there is a good one too. Stauf isn't totally evil.

This gets more and more difficult as the winter swiftly approaches. And on top of all that, there&rsquo;s this big terrifying polar bear&hellip;<br/><br/>The game uses an innovative worker placement mechanism combined with a resource management and a bit of bluffing. It uses dice in a few interesting ways but none of them require you to roll them. ;-)<br/><br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/><br/>Every round players build a new landscape out of the 6 double sided land cards. As they do, they place their two camps along the way. Numbers on the chosen land cards determine the player order for the next round.<br/><br/>Every land card is divided in half, so you do not choose a single card, but you have to combine two of them to form the complete location for your camp.<br/><br/>At the start of the round, players secretly send their polar bear to one of the land cards and since you try to avoid the bear and want to get the best card at the same time, it brings a small bluffing aspect to the game.<br/><br/>After completing the landscape, players resolve their camps. One of the camps serve as a &quot;day camp&quot; and the other as a &quot;night camp&quot; and each of them has a bit different purpose.<br/><br/>While resolving a camp you can use all the resources shown on its location, but you have to fit them into your inventory to be able to use them later in the game. You can even build useful tools, but they take place in your inventory as well. <br/> Scoring is resolved every round in your night camp and consists of feeding your Inuit and keeping him warm.<br/><br/>The land cards serve also as a timer. One of them is flipped the &quot;winter&quot; side up every round and the game ends when all the land cards got flipped.<br/><br/><br/>The game was designed for the 2017 9-Card Nanogame P&amp;P Design Contest.<br/><br/>"}, "225236": {"poll": [], "name": "Assault on Hill 60", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3528652_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Kilovolt Design"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3528652.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War I"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "This is the first game of Kilovolt Design's tactical mini wargame series &quot;Winning or Losing&quot;.

There are three decks of cards: red Bear cards, blue Bull cards and white Speculation cards. All three piles are placed face down on the board, along with a pile of stock certificates, each bearing the name of a different major company and a $1,000 face value. Each player puts $100 to start in the Broker space.<br/><br/>On their turn, players roll 2D6. On a 3-6, they draw a Bear card. On a 7-11, they draw a Bull card. Either variety may offer an opportunity to take a Speculation card. On a 2 or 12, they collect all cash and stock in the Broker space, and each player then pays another $100 into the space.<br/><br/>While some cards call for cash or stock to be paid to or from the Broker or other players, most provide a market up or down number. This does not affect the value of any stock, however. Each player has a scorecard with a metal clip that starts at zero and can move from -20 to +20. Each time the player's market hits +13 on the way up and +20, he draws a free stock certificate. He loses the same at -13 and -20. The winner of the game is the first to accumulate $7,500 in cash and stock value.<br/><br/>This Depression-era game has a clear upward bias: players draw Bear cards only 39% of the time, with the remaining rolls being positive; and 60% of the Speculation cards are positive.

For that to have happened, two changes in the timeline need have taken place during the first half of that year.<br/><br/>First, Churchill would&rsquo;ve had to put off the British general election until after Japan was defeated. He had the political leverage to do that, but against all good advice he chose not to do so. He mistakenly believed the recent victory over Nazi Germany was enough to sustain his coalition government in power.<br/><br/>Second, he would have had to convince US President Harry Truman, then only recently come into office after the death of FDR, that preemptive war against the Soviets was the best choice among a limited number of strategic options. A close study of the debate that went on historically within the White House and Pentagon at the time concerning the idea indicates that, by March 1946, those Washington powerbrokers had become convinced a new World War &ndash; with the USSR as the primary enemy &ndash; was indeed coming and coming soon. Had that conviction taken hold in Washington just eight months sooner &ndash; and it well might have, had Stalin or Tito been only a little more aggressive in their territorial and political demands &ndash; this would not be an alternative history design.<br/><br/>The general flow of the game inescapably has the Allies on the offensive at its start. On the Soviet side, that player is immediately faced with a decision to either &ldquo;fight forward,&rdquo; with Berlin as the central core of that gambit, or retreating east with the idea of slowly wearing down the Allied offensive and then counterattacking into its flanks late in the game. Further, though the Allies have the ability to make paradrops and amphibious invasions, they lack the dedicated manpower necessary to make such gambits automatically decisive.

Many flower farmers strive for a better Kiku. There are flower festivals where you can find and buy many flowers, and so a festival focused on Kiku is \u83ca\u82b1\u796d, especially with plants shown in competition. But \u8cfd (sai) is dice, so \u83ca\u82b1\u8cfd is also Kikkasai, making a Flower Festival Dice game.<br/><br/>The game follows the style of Mahjong, drawing dice from a bag, rolling, discarding, trying to complete sets. In this game, you only handle 2 + 1 dice, so your target is to create one single set. Many of the rules match Mahjong; draw 1 discard 1, claiming the dice your opponent discards, or the rule of &quot;trend&quot; which gives you extra points (like the Dora rule in Mahjong).<br/><br/>Initially, one die is placed as the &quot;trend&quot;. You get extra points for winning a hand<br/>by using a same colored die / same pip with the trend die. Then each player grabs 2 dice from the bag and rolls behind their screen. These dice are the players' hands.<br/><br/>Each turn, if you can use the last die discarded by your opponent to complete your set, you declare and win the round. If not, you grab a die from the bag and roll. If the 3 dice (2 in your hand and 1 just rolled) completes your hand, you win the round and score points. If not, you must discard 1 die, either from your hand, or the rolled one. Be careful not to toss out a die your opponent wants. Now the turn switches to your opponent.<br/><br/>The round ends when any player wins, or the bag is out of dice. Put all the dice back in the bag. If any player has 0 points or less, that player loses. Or else, start a new round, switching the starting player.<br/><br/>The publisher says:<br/>A 2 player game of dice-Mahjong.<br/><br/>The game takes place in the Finals of a Flower show competition for prize Chrysanthemum. You aim for the victory by completing your set of Chrysanthemum dice. Both players start from 6 points, and you win by depleting your opponents' points to 0.<br/><br/>Basic game set is for 2, but combining 2 sets would allow you to play by 3 or 4 players.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>\uff12\u4eba\u7528\u306e\u30c0\u30a4\u30b9\u9ebb\u96c0\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3059\u3002<br/>\u821e\u53f0\u306f\u83ca\u306e\u54c1\u8a55\u4f1a\u306e\u6c7a\u52dd\u6226\u3002<br/>\uff13\u3064\u306e\u83ca\u30c0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u63c3\u3048\u3066\u512a\u52dd\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\uff16\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u305a\u3064\u6301\u3063\u3066\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u3057\u3001\u76f8\u624b\u306e\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\uff10\u306b\u3059\u308b\u3068\u52dd\u3061\u3067\u3059\u3002<br/>\u203b\u57fa\u672c\uff12\u4eba\u7528\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\uff12\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3042\u308b\u3068\uff13\u4eba\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3001\uff14\u4eba\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/><br/>"}, "225273": {"poll": [], "name": "Three Cheers for Master: Santa Claws", "playingtime": "40", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Take That"], "yearpublished": "2015", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3527410_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Atlas Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3527410.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "maxplaytime": "40", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Humor"], "age": "13", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "4 promo unique cards for Three Cheers for Master.<br/><br/>These cards was released for Christmas.
