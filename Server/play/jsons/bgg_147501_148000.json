Masters can manipulate the course of events in the world around them, changing their own Fates through their control or theft of Soulstones. A variety of fantastic and frightening beings, collectively known as Minions, serve the Master as fodder in his or her machinations. In addition, Henchmen can lead specialized Crews in their Master's absence, or serve their Master directly as a member of a Crew. Masters and Henchmen are also supported by Totems, extensions of their magical abilities which increase their spellcasting range and provide additional aid in an Encounter. Lastly, each Master can transform itself into a powerful Avatar, representing a specific aspect of their personality.<br/><br/>How well a Crew carries out its leader's Strategy and Schemes determines whether or not it will emerge victorious in an Encounter with an enemy Crew. Strategies represent the Crew's main path to victory, while Schemes are simpler alternate routes to achieve the leader's goals.<br/><br/>Malifaux players use decks of cards called Fate Decks to resolve game events such as attacking and spell-casting.

The Saboteur must blow it up. Neither want to die. Choose which role to play in these two exciting games of strategy.<br/><br/>User Summary:<br/><br/>Saboteur was an early game by the legendary Don Priestly (Trap Door, Popeye). The core of the game is similar whether you play the Saboteur or the Guard. The screen represents a top-down view of a warehouse, filled with 200 boxes of ammunition represented by Xs. The guard is represented by an *, and the Saboteur is represented by an S. The aim of the Saboteur is to place a charge such that a chain reaction is caused, blowing up as many boxes of ammunition as possible.<br/><br/>When playing the Guard, the objective is to stop the Saboteur reaching the prime location which will blow up the most boxes. You are armed only with a truncheon, which prevents the Saboteur entering a 5x5 box centred on the Guard. The Guard gets enough time to make 20 moves before the Saboteur starts moving. There are therefore two options - move so that the Saboteur is blocked from moving, or try to identify where the ideal location for the Saboteur to plant his charge is, and guard that location. Points are scored if the Saboteur is prevented from reaching his ideal location, points are lost for every box which is destroyed and a large number of points are lost if the Guard is caught in an explosion (though he is not killed). After each run by the Saboteur, new boxes are added. The game repeats until the Saboteur has made more than 250 moves.<br/><br/>When playing as the Saboteur, you get 40 moves to go and place the charge, then 10 further moves to retreat to a safe distance before it explodes. Points are scored for every box destroyed. Large numbers of points are scored for catching the Guard in an explosion. Large numbers of points are lost if the Saboteur is blown up. Destroyed boxes are replaced after each charge explodes and the game repeats as the Saboteur attempts to place his 10 charges. However in this game, the Guard is much more deadly. He is now armed with a rifle, and if there is ever an unobstructed horizontal or vertical path between the Guard and the Saboteur, then the Saboteur will be shot and killed instantly (no matter how many charges he still has available).<br/><br/>The inlay indicates that a ZX81 with 16K memory is required. As with many ZX81 games, the inlay includes instructions for POKEs which alter the game. In this case, the speed can be altered, as can the number of ammunition boxes in each of the games.<br/><br/>"}, "147551": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Pursuit of Harmony", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1774843_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1774843.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Trivia"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "&quot;it's more than a game&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;A TRIBUTE TO<br/><br/>Forrest C.

The procedure is repeated for Contestant B.<br/>6. Should a tied score result - the following game is then played.<br/>7. The winner is entitled to play Super Match.<br/>8.Compere picks up Super Match card and asks the contestant to respond a word (e.g. for Game 1 use the word 'FACE'. For Game 2 use 'BABY' etc.)<br/>9.Contestant may ask all others at the table for help. Prize money is paid dependent upon which response the contestant selects corresponding to the three previous selected answers, (e.g. Word 1 'FACE', If Contestant says 'FACE MASK' he/she wins $50.<br/>10.If the contestant gives one of the three answers (i.e. Pack. Mask or Life, he/she is entitled to play for the Jackpot Match.<br/>11.If none of the three words is selected, the game finishes and another contestant is selected to play against the winner.<br/>(NOTE: The two number '9's' are actually listed on the instruction card.)<br/><br/>Jackpot Match<br/>1.Compere gives both the contestants and himself a pad and pencil.<br/>2.Compere reads out the word (e.g. Game 1 - he reads Comic).<br/>3.Compere and contestant each secretly respond on paper (e.g. Comic Book or Comic Strip). If the answers are identical, the contestant wins 10x his/her winnings from the immediate preceding Super Match round.<br/>4.The game is thus completed and a new contestant is selected to compete against the current champion.<br/>(NOTE: After completing Game 1, remove question card from wallet and lay face up on the table - then place Game 2 when completed on top, and so on. When the wallet is empty, turn the whole set of questions upside down and place them all back in the wallet - Remember to replace the Key Cards.)<br/><br/>"}, "147567": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1769790.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Inka Brand", "Markus Brand"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Axel Scheffler"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Schmidt Spiele"], "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1769790_t.png", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Novel-based"], "description": "In Der Gr&uuml;ffelo: Alles wird gut!, alles won't be gut unless you can reach the gruffalo before the owl, snake and fox fully emerge from the forest and eat you up, you being a tasty little mouse.<br/><br/>To set up play, arrange the nine tiles in a 3x3 field with the gruffalo tile at the end of the dotted path on these tiles.

This is Alteil: Horizons, the all new sequel to one of Japan&rsquo;s most popular online card games, soon to be ready for fantasy, tactical combat, card game, and anime enthusiasts worldwide.<br/><br/>Four Gods Sleep Under Lavato&hellip;<br/><br/>Harness Their Power!<br/><br/>You are an Iczer, a summoner and master strategist tasked with protecting the world of Lavato from the forces of Batora, the embodiment of evil accross all dimensions. An ancient struggle between Batora and the four Old Gods of Lavato drained the Gods of power, sinking them into a sleep that has lasted thousands of years. But the Gods still influence Lavato from the depths of slumber&hellip;<br/><br/>One night, a new Prince is born, and the sun suddenly rises. Night becomes day, and a miracle is proclaimed. The Church of the True God takes advantage of the miracle to orchestrate the installation of the Solar Prince to the throne - and the ensuing power struggle plunges Lavato into war.<br/><br/>With the violence, tragedy, and death of the war, Batora&rsquo;s hunger for evil and chaos is stoked - and he&rsquo;s set his sights on Lavato again! But with the Old Gods deep in slumber, who will protect Lavato from Batora&rsquo;s endless rage?<br/><br/>Now is the time of the Iczers. They&rsquo;ve studied the legends of Lavato&rsquo;s Old Gods. They&rsquo;ve learned to command the Gods&rsquo; powerful Four Spheres of Influence. They&rsquo;ve mastered the art of using these Spheres to summon heroes, monsters, and dragons to battle the forces of chaos and evil. Will you be the brave Iczer who saves Lavato from destruction?<br/><br/>As in any collectible card game, a game of Alteil: Horizons begins with carefully crafting a deck. There&rsquo;s a universe of over 1,000 cards to choose from, each representing the factions, heroes, villains, monsters and magic of Lavato&rsquo;s past and present. Your collection begins with any of four free 30-card starter decks, themed around the four Spheres.<br/><br/>Once you&rsquo;ve challenged another Iczer to a duel, use your resources wisely to play your cards. Spell cards represent your command of the Spheres; unit cards represent your ability to summon heroes and monsters. Each unit is a fully fleshed-out combatant, complete with hit points, attack and defense power, agility, and range. Combat takes place on a battle grid - maneuver your units so that their unique abilities fit your winning strategy. And their abilities really are unique! A fighter with two swords might be able to hit two enemies at once; a mage can tap into your resources to play spells that wreak havoc on the entire battlefield! You have complete control of each unit&rsquo;s abilities during combat.<br/><br/>A number of features set Alteil apart from the other online card games out there. For example...<br/><br/>Range based grid: position archers behind your front-line fighters to launch a ranged attack. Position your mages in the rear to protect them as they cast powerful defensive and offensive spells.<br/><br/>Resource recycling: when a card dies, you get back the resources you spent on it. Two small soldiers die? Use the Spell Points they originally cost to bring out something big and scary.<br/><br/>Revival system: if a unit dies you can spend a copy of it from your deck to revive it on the battlefield. Keep your best soldiers alive to execute killer multi-unit combos!<br/><br/>Soul Cards: influence the pace of the game by choosing your starting Life Points and Soul Skills. Give yourself stronger Soul Skills and less Life for a more offense-based approach, or give yourself more Life Points to buy time for a crafty strategy.<br/><br/>Day/Night cycle: as duels rage on, the sun rises and sets. Units like the Undead and Werewolves are stronger at night - while a holy warrior gets bonuses under the first rays of morning - so summon them when they&rsquo;ll be most effective!<br/><br/>Alteil has over two thousand individual pieces of art completed already. It&rsquo;s got the visual style and story of a Japanese RPG. It&rsquo;s got unique game mechanics. We hope you&rsquo;ll become a huge fan. We already are.

Most of them are tourists without the experience or skills needed to climb an eight-thousander. Without proper help they wouldn't make it to the Himalayas, let alone brave the mighty Chomolungma.<br/><br/>Fortunately, that's where you come in, an experienced mountaineer and mountain guide. You've got Broad Peak, K2 and other eight-thousanders under your belt, and you've climbed Mount Everest several times.

You gaze at the mountain and you know this to be true &ndash; what is child's play for you might be the last adventure of your clients.<br/><br/>You must plan where to set up camp and how to deal with acclimatization, who to take up to the peak and when, and who to lead down the mountain. When you look at your clients' enthusiastic faces, you know that their lives are in your hands.<br/><br/>In Mount Everest players take control of a team of two expert mountaineers who must lead as many tourists as they can to the peak and, of course, safely bring them back. Each player gets an identical deck of cards that are used for moving around the board. Players must decide where to set up camps and how much oxygen to bring to the top; only oxygen lets players get acclimatization cards, which allow tourists to survive the climb. Players must also decide what type of customers they want: the athletic, fairly competent climbers, or the wealthier and more prestigious amateurs. Climbing with one tourist in tow is easy, but the key to victory lies in guiding whole groups. Unfortunately, the more people you take with you, the higher the likelihood is of something going wrong. Also, as it is in the mountains, the weather will be a crucial factor.

Players moves either allow them end movement on locations or &lsquo;Chapter Disks&rsquo;.

Players on &lsquo;Chapter Disks&rsquo; of another player&rsquo;s color end their round.

It is basically the same thing to have characters describe in detail how they are sneaking about, but it is far more exciting than just making a single check and extrapolating the results from there.<br/><br/>Players may decide to enter an Encounter against un-alerted opponents in an effort to sneak past them or to take them out quietly. Either way, it&rsquo;s a tactical option and is treated as such, complete with increased chance of gaining Risk as well as earning SP rewards.<br/><br/>"}, "147652": {"rpgdesigner": ["Christopher De La Rosa", "Ivan Van Norman", "Robert B.

The game lets you choose between two specific styles of play &ndash; &quot;character driven&quot;, that supports a Story Now agenda, and &quot;classical&quot;, which is focused on more traditional adventuring.

It is an animistic world where living clouds, mountains and winds coexist with dragons and other mythical beasts. Life clings to the surface of the continental shields of gigantic beings submerged in the magma below. These shields have been forged into a world sphere in order to protect the burning Furians within. The entire world shows many signs of having been put in place according to some divine plan, but the actual work has been delegated to befuddled servants. In this way reality is a flawed and poor implementation of a divine design. Magic works, but rarely quite as expected. Magicians are feared but also suspected of interfering with the divine plans even further and are often hounded by clerics. Most powerful of all are those who know &quot;The High Speech&quot;, the forbidden words of the gods' that command creation and reality.<br/><br/>"}, "147670": {"rpgartist": ["Martin Bergstr\u00f6m", "Daniel Falck", "Tobias Tranell"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version Mod10-Jun-2013"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Last Days of Arhem", "rpgdesigner": ["Tomas H\u00e4renstam"], "rpgproducer": ["Dan Algstrand", "Christian Granath", "Peter Larsson"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1771997.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Fria Ligan"], "rpg": ["Svavelvinter"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1771997_t.png", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>Welcome to The Last Days of Arhem.

This is the eighth year of the common reckoning of the setting, which starts at the inauguration of a mechanical and chronometric masterpiece known as the 'Chronolaab'.

Each Extraordinaire is a larger-than-life character with extraordinary needs. They live in a unique environment, have different physical needs or have an unusual job. It's your job to design the ultimate objects to fit their worlds.<br/><br/>How To Play:<br/><br/><br/>     Pick three Extraordinaire from a shuffled deck. There are a range of Extraordinaires available, from a Merman to an Astronaut. Each card has a picture of the Extraordinaire on the front and, when you turn it over, a little more insight into their world.<br/>     Pick three Object cards from the deck - this is what your Extraordinaire needs you to create for them. Assign one Object to each character. These Objects could be something to sit on, something to wear and much more.<br/>     You also have Think cards in three categories - Research, Design, Improve. You sort these into three facedown piles.<br/>     Now choose which Design job you are going to do - pick an Extraordinaire and their Object from the three option.<br/>     It is now your challenge to design this object for this Extraordinaire.<br/>     Use your Idea Pad and Pen to design the ultimate Object to suit the needs of the Extraordinaire. Describe your ideas using doodles and words. You don't have to be a good artist - good design is about good ideas!<br/>     Use Think cards to help you with your design. Good designers ask questions and this is where your Think cards help you. <br/><br/><br/>- The Research cards prompt you to take a closer look at the       Extraordinaire's world e.g. What is different about where the Extraordinaire lives or works?                                           -  The Design cards introduce different aspects of design like materials, shapes and colours e.g. How will your design be put away when not in use?<br/>- The Improve cards push you to think about your design and make it even better e.g. How can you make your design more friendly to the environment?<br/><br/>     Once you're happy with your design, give it a catchy name!<br/>     Now it's time to share your ideas - present your idea to a parent or friend. Start with the name of your design and explain why the Extraordinaire needs your product. Describe your concept, your research and what makes your design great! This gives you a chance to rationalise your idea and tie all the aspects of the design together, as well as building up some really great presentation skills.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>You can also download an accompanying app that allows you to upload your designs and create a &quot;portfolio&quot;.<br/><br/>You can play alone or in multiplayer mode. In multiplayer, each player takes a design job. You can set a time limit on the game allowing the designs to be casual or serious. The designs are named and presented just like single player mode, however there is now the addition of Award cards. After the presentations, each player is dealt an award card e.g. Best Presentation, the player then awards the player they think gave the best presentation and explains why. If you want a more competitive game, play multiple rounds. The person who wins the greatest variety of awards is the winner.<br/><br/>The Extraordinaires gives your imagination and creativity a workout, challenging you to think in new ways.<br/><br/>"}, "147679": {"rpgdesigner": ["Herv\u00e9 Carteau", "David Millians", "Roderick Robertson", "Greg Stafford", "Jane Williams"], "statistics": [], "name": "Rule One (Issue 6 - Nov 2010)", "rpgartist": ["Roderick Robertson"], "rpgproducer": ["Roderick Robertson"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1772660.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Rule One"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Sects of Kralorela", "Soluthor the Creeping Dead", "The Great Temple of Rufdayan", "The Kingdom of Seshnela", "We Will Remember Them"], "rpg": ["HeroQuest (2nd Edition)", "RuneQuest (1st & 2nd Editions)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1772660_t.jpg", "description": "From the official website:<br/><br/>David Millians gives us a number of minor sects (lawful and otherwise) of Kralorela, while Herv&eacute; Cateau gives us a glimpse at life in the kingdom of Seshnela.

Once disparate tribes governed separate stretches of the river, but unification was followed by the institution of a sophisticated governing administration. But no-one goes to Hatrasis province. Tribal politics going back over a century fuel a modern-day insurgency there, a guerrilla conflict that the Mazandaran government is quietly attempting to put down with determined military force.

Points are awarded for helping citizens escape, keeping them alive until the Martians are destroyed and killing the Martian war machines.<br/><br/>The inhabitants of London have no say over the greater workings of the Martian invasion or the government's response to it, relying on garbled rumours and reports to keep them informed. Game plays out over a fixed narrative of eight 'Headlines', which reveal the next stage of the invasion and events within the narrative are controlled by a 'Tidings' deck which instructs the players how to manipulate the invaders and the military who are trying to counter the threat. The Tidings deck also contains the Red Creeper, which spread across the board as the game progresses. Once consumed by the alien plant a space is no longer safe from the Martian's terrible Death Ray. These Tidings can be manipulated by players through the use of five Character cards, each of which has a special ability and each of which can be used only once per game so timing must be chosen carefully.<br/><br/>Escape from London is achieved by leaving the board from one of five stations or the docks. As Headlines are revealed these escape routes begin closing and as the Martians grow more prolific, the Red Creeper spreads, the available military units dwindle and escape routes shut so the tensions build and players begin to turn on each other to compete for the few remaining avenues of exodus.<br/><br/>"}, "147741": {"poll": [], "name": "Moose Hunt", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1898", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Deer", "Sports: Hunting"], "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1774765_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Chaffee & Selchow"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1774765.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Moose Hunt game made by Chaffee and Selchow (later Selchow &amp; Righter) is a typical roll and move board game with wonderful graphics depicting a hunter and Indian killing moose.<br/><br/>The first player who crosses the &quot;start&quot; line wins the game.<br/><br/>"}, "147742": {"rpgdesigner": ["Todd Bolling", "Mike Colton", "Steve Kenson", "Jon F.

As long as the value is higher with the applied bonus or penalty (or neither if they're the same type of argument), you can play that card in response.<br/><br/>2nd is the roleplaying aspect. Every time you play a card, you must make an argument of the type of argument you played. Hence, if you're the zombie, you might make an 3 value Emotional plea of &quot;We've always been such good friends, and I would hate to have you be ripped to shreds by some other zombies. Let me eat your brain, and I'll turn you into a zombie so we can be friends forever!&quot; and as the survivor you might reply with a 2 value Logical argument which is actually a 4 against the previous 3 emotional and say something like &quot;One would think if you were truly my friend you would defend me from these other zombies, or at the very least stop trying to eat my brain.&quot;<br/><br/>3rd is the trick-taking mechanic. To win the game, you must win 5 arguments Each player starts the argument with a hand of 5 cards and uses those cards to make their argument. When they can no longer beat the argument on the table (or if they choose not to), the last person to play a card wins that argument. You may play two cards of the same argument type to overcome an existing argument. If a player completely runs out of cards and has no more to respond to their opponent's argument, they lose.<br/><br/>"}, "147760": {"poll": [], "name": "Crazy Machines 1.5", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Windows edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1782183.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Crazy Machines"], "videogametheme": ["Puzzle"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["FAKT Software GmbH"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "6", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Viva Media"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1782183_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Crazy Machines 1.5 is a stand alone sequel to Crazy Machines which uses the same engine and introduces new contraptions.<br/><br/>It contains 2 labs with 100 challenges each. &quot;Inventor's Training Camp&quot; contains 100 easy challenges targetted to children.  &quot;New from the Lab&quot; contains 100 new challenges with similar difficulty to the original Crazy Machines Game.<br/><br/>"}, "147762": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1784816.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["David Carl"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "12", "boardgamepublisher": ["Privateer Press"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1784816_t.png", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game"], "description": "Bolster your armies with The Big Guns, the first expansion for Warmachine: High Command! <br/><br/>The Big Guns contains 5 copies each of 16 different cards, plus 4 additional warcaster cards, to bring new strategies to your Cygnar, Khador, Protectorate of Menoth, and Cryx decks.<br/><br/>Requires Warmachine: High Command core set to play.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "name": "Warmachine: High Command \u2013 The Big Guns", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Deck / Pool Building"], "average": "6.97419", "boardgameexpansion": ["Warmachine: High Command"], "usersrated": "31", "boardgamefamily": ["High Command", "Warmachine"]}, "147763": {"rpgdesigner": ["Falk Behr", "Peer Bieber", "Lars Blumenstein", "Florian Don-Schauen", "Momo Evers", "Timo Gleichmann", "Tobias Hamelmann", "Christian Lonsing", "Martina Sofie Noeth", "Heiko Oertel", "Jens Ullrich", "Andr\u00e9 Wiesler", "Tobias Wolter (I)"], "rpgitemversion": ["German Softcover"], "statistics": [], "name": "Shadowrun - Die 6.

The first wraith in the book, the plague wraith (CR 7), is created by plague victims who are shut away and left to die by the healthy. They carry a number of deadly diseases, including the dreaded wraith&rsquo;s wasting, which slowly transforms the victim into a plague wraith himself, and they can possess the bodies of those suffering from diseases. The second wraith is the lifedrinker wraith (CR 9), whose touch instills a deadly curse that blocks healing, and which can drain the life force from victims in a 30-ft.-cone. Finally, there is the doom wraith (CR 14), which spawns large number of standard wraiths from the creatures it kills, and can leave foes in an apathetic stupor, though it can be fought by the power of concentrated hope and goodwill.<br/><br/>"}, "147772": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Gamma World (1st Edition)", "Gamma World (2nd Edition)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Mutant Manual II", "rpgdesigner": ["Brutorz Bill", "Les Braun", "Dirk Collins", "Bob Crichton", "Kim Eastland", "Robert Flack", "Gary Gygax", "Derek Holland", "B.

Immerse yourself in a fantastic world of cultures, myths, and legends. Magic is everywhere and with it the people can bend reality to their will or break it and unleash even more terrible things trapped in the emptiness called the Twain.<br/><br/>Ehdrigohr is a roleplaying game focused around storytelling, high drama, and horror. Players will create heroes and heroines who hold back the tides so the people can see another day.<br/><br/>Powered by Fate.<br/><br/>[Taken from introductory and site text.]<br/>In Ehdrigohr, tribal people in a broken world strive to unify while struggling against the horrors that wait for the night to fall.<br/><br/>Ehdrigohr is a Fate Core System based tabletop role-playing game. It is inspired from the mythology and lore of tribal peoples from across the world but has a particular foundation inspired from Lakotah stories and folklore.<br/><br/>In Ehdrigohr you get to play a character struggling to survive in this recovering world. It is a fantasy game of high heroics, myth and culture, powerful magic, and survival horror. The tides of darkness are overwhelming but this is not meant to be a game of nihilism. It is about hope. Your characters are the mythic heroes who do impossible things that push back the terrible tide.<br/><br/>There are multitudes of paths to greatness.<br/><br/>     A warrior, imbued with mystic martial arts who fights on The Line?<br/>     A storyteller who keeps the peoples' spirits up and empowers their hearts to fight another day.<br/>     A wandering peacekeeper that ferrets out the infiltrators and hatemongers who work to break the nations.<br/>     A reality weaving Way-walker who travels the wild places seeking the breaches where the creatures trapped in the Twain have broken through the pale into the world.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Culturally, Ehdrigohr is a non-traditional fantasy world. Rather than fantasy seen through a Euro-Medieval lens, Ehdrigohr is instead crafted to take inspiration from the myth and folklore of tribal, and indigenous, cultures around the world with particular inspiration from traditions of the Lakhota people.<br/><br/>Though it is a human-centric world, each of the cultures of Ehdrigohr promises to have its own flavor steeped in magic. These are not &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; cultures but nations that have chosen their own interesting paths and traditions in their effort to survive the ravenous hordes that come in the night. Though it presents a different flavor of fantasy, there is a point of entry for many styles of play. There is high adventure, political intrigue, delving, social plays, secret societies, monster bashing, monster fleeing, and so on.<br/><br/>Mechanically, Ehdrigohr relies on the Fate Core system to deliver its fun and focus on dramatic storytelling. The mechanics have been tailored to the ideals of the setting, though you can still expand on it with ideas from other FATE-based games out there in the market.<br/><br/>In addition to being a fun game and an interesting world to explore Ehdrigohr is also a game of allegories. It examines our relationships with each other and the powerful force that is depression and how it whittles away at us, sending terrible thoughts that come when we are in dark places, bring us shivers, and cause us to fade. We hope to inspire people to hold strong in the darkness and fight your way through to a new light.<br/><br/>So please join us. Make a character, choose your place, and hold the line in the night.<br/><br/>", "usersrated": "4", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Softcover version"], "average": "7.25", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure", "Culture", "Fantasy (Low Fantasy)", "Horror (Supernatural)", "Mythology / Folklore"], "rpgpublisher": ["Council of Fools"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1777349_t.png", "rpgpodcastepisode": ["74.

They marched all the way to  Abomey, the capital of the land, and found the rulers gone. They  amused themselves by looting the city for souvenirs. The French press  was most impressed by a white parasol decorated with human jawbones.<br/><br/>They never saw the inside of that parasol. Inside it was a map drawn  in human blood, a map that pointed to a legendary city deep in Africa's interior. This city was called the City of Brass, a bastion of ancient  African civilization full of treasure, both gold and knowledge. Sadi Carnot, the president of France, sent a expedition on that  doomed journey. It only took three weeks for them to become hopelessly lost in an uncharted land. To this day, no one knows what happened to them. According to legend, only one of them made it, and his  greatest wishes were given unto him.<br/><br/>In this game, you will play those lost souls.

Both have unique characteristics and abilities available only to their respective faction. In general, the Marines can perform ranged attacks and have strong firepower and good defensive positions. The Portalists, on the other hand, can deploy units for free, and their units can move quickly. Additionally, the area cards of the game board grant special abilities to the player who controls them. When a player manages to eliminate all enemy units on his turn, the game ends and that player wins.<br/><br/>To set up the game, players determine a start player, draw five unit cards to their hands, and take alternating turns to bring those units into play on their area cards. Then the game begins, with the start player using two action points (AP) in his first turn. In each subsequent turn, players have four action points at their disposal, which can be spent to carry out the following actions in any order as often as desired:<br/><br/><br/>     Draw a card<br/>     Play a card<br/>     Move a unit<br/>     Attack<br/><br/><br/>In addition to the actions above, players can get free actions and bonuses from the area cards they control and can use special abilities that are available only to their faction only. Units are one of three types &mdash; Regular, Elite, or Colossal &mdash; and can attack only one unit type. For instance, an Elite unit that can deal damage to Regular units cannot deal damage to Elite or Colossal units.<br/><br/>To achieve victory, players need to consider the defense and attack types of their army, and the faction strengths and weaknesses, along with the abilities that they get from the terrain that they control.

Sorcerers inherit their magic from their parents. Clerics get their magic from their god. Druids get their magic from nature. And witches get their magic from an eldritch pact made with a supernatural patron&hellip;at least in theory. But the mechanics behind the witch&rsquo;s patron class feature just don&rsquo;t promote that sort of thing. When choosing between patrons like &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; and &ldquo;moon,&rdquo; and knowing that the only real effect is a handful of bonus spells known, the excitement of choosing an otherworldly patron seems to just fade away.<br/><br/>This book takes witch patrons in a wild new direction that greatly expands them into something that can be fun and interesting at the game table. The book contains 10 new patrons, each of which is an individual entity rather than a vague concept, and each of which has extensive descriptions of his or her personality, background, and goals, as well as the types of familiars that the patron typically grants, information on other followers of the patron, and so on.<br/><br/>Even more exciting, choosing one of the patrons in this book does more than grant you bonus spells. Each patron comes with a number of mechanical benefits and drawbacks associated with making a magical pact with them, which function similarly to an archetype, meaning that one&rsquo;s choice of patron is meaningful mechanically, as well as flavorfully. With 10 patrons to choose from, there are plenty of options, including:<br/><br/>     Al&rsquo;Rajan, a crafy efreeti cursed to grant any wish asked of him, who attempts to pass this burden on to those to whom he grants magic.<br/>     Irashen, a celestial general who is happy to loan out some of heaven&rsquo;s power to mortals who will use it to fight evil.<br/>     Jodan, an insane spirit obsessed with humor, whose magic is incredibly unreliable.<br/>     Tesherazz, a powerful devil who empowers witches in his employ with the ability to make magically-binding contracts.<br/>     Thyrvinistar, a powerful dragon who is willing to share his magic in exchange for nothing more than raw gold.<br/>     And many more!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>So if you&rsquo;ve ever wished that your witch&rsquo;s patron was a little less one-dimensional, or just want some new options and archetypes for the witch class, this is the book for you. Even if you don&rsquo;t care one bit for witches, GMs looking for powerful cosmic entities to serve as enemies, allies, patrons, or temptations for their party will find a wealth of ideas and useful information on the various entities included in this book.

Little by little, they are losing certain feelings and certain emotions. It begins with joy and love, but once they are weakened, they also lose their most negative emotions, like anger or sadness. Eventually there will be the fateful day when indifference and apathy take over, when the emotionless townspeople reach a state known as the Coldness. Now that they have become mere automatons in the eyes of those around them, they are no more than soulless organic robots.<br/><br/>However, children and adolescents, all worried about their parents, still hold hope.

Each &quot;day&quot; begins at 0600hrs, with an interesting mechanic of rolling for the amount of elapsed time for each turn, where a turn can be as short as zero minutes to as long as three hours. Each &quot;day&quot; ends when the time record for the day passes 1800hrs (or both players pass). Combat occurs at then end of any turn where units of opposing sides occupy the same area. Combat is done by rolling 10-sided dice for each strengthpoint of either infantry or armor in the combat, with simultaneous losses. Victory is gauged by the accumulation of points for enemy casualties, objective spaces, and Axis across the Meuse/exiting the western map edge, with daily sudden-death victory point levels.<br/><br/>Components consist of an 11' x 17&quot; mounted map, 180 mounted counters/markers, a 12-page rule booklet, terrain effects chart, hours in the day and victory point charts, plastic bags for counter storage, and four ten-sided dice.<br/><br/>"}, "147922": {"average": "7", "poll": [], "name": "Aquanemo", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Card Games: Card Fishing"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2543308_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["GMK - Global MKT 4 Kids"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Janod Jeux"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2543308.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Animals", "Children's Game"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Aquanemo is a fast magnetic fishing game.

All you need is a standard deck of cards, the rules, one or more friends willing to learn the game and want to have fun.<br/><br/>Players start with a group of survivors, represented by the cards in their hand. Each turn, which represents a normal day, consists of gathering resources, creating defenses, expanding the group's strength, battling other groups of survivors, and of course killing zombies. Throughout the game, players use card combinations in order to experience unique scenarios like fighting against zombie hordes, training up soldiers, and even witnessing their own members turn zombie. The simplistic nature of this game offers great entertainment and interaction between players, yet it provides enough challenge and diversity to keep you playing over and over.<br/><br/>In order to win, players must survive through the deck by increasing the amount of cards in their hand. This is accomplished by gathering Resources, killing Zombies, creating Defenses, and battling other players. When the last card of the deck is drawn, each player takes a final turn. Then players count the remaining cards in their hand and keep track of that score. After three rounds of Outlast, whoever has the highest total score wins and has &ldquo;Outlasted&rdquo; everyone.<br/><br/>While the mechanics of this game is simple, the complex part of this game is that each card has a different value, whether it represents zombies, gas, food, defense, guns, or more. Combinations with different cards also add an extra layer of strategy as players must decide what to play to help themselves and hurt others.<br/><br/>The game offers an instruction manual, a place matt, specific player inventory cards, and player help charts (to keep track of the different card values).

The king has only so much time before he is overpowered by his own subjects but using guile and swords of his guards he may be able to eliminate the assassins and hopefully escape into the safety of his palace.<br/><br/>The gameplay is based upon Action Cards which show a limited number of Action Points available to both sides. First, the king and his knights move around the board securing their position or eliminating dangers by pushing aside the crowd, then the assassins hidden among the crowd prepare for their lethal strike by killing guards or making the king's progress slower. It's up to the players to make the most of the Action Points available in the current round. The king's player wins if he manages to escape from the board using one of the exits or if his knights eliminate all the assassins. The assassins win if they kill the king by dealing him two wounds or stall him long enough so that the Action Card deck is depleted.<br/><br/>Choose your strategy, hide the assassins among twelve beautifully illustrated citizens and play two different scenarios, each with a multitude of choices, in this simple yet rewarding game.

It is your sole responsibility to manipulate their decisions for the good of your vassals. You will have to evacuate as many as you can to the New Land using different fantastic vessels, hoping that the Atlaneans will recover and their legacy will endure for millennia to come.<br/><br/>End of Atlantis: Revised Edition, created by the acclaimed Polish game designer Marcin We\u0142nicki, is an upgraded and reinvented version of a great and masterfully illustrated game of strategy based on a unique action execution and resource management system. Each player will use various methods to achieve victory: senate factions that provide different abilities, politics cards with different actions, and special cards that change the flow of the game. You should also keep in mind that as the game progresses, global events will unfold - if used to your advantage, they may push you ahead or completely hamper your doings... and that's on top of other players plotting against you!<br/><br/>In comparison to the first edition of End of Atlantis, some major changes have been made. Firstly, the game is shorter and more dynamic thanks to completely new event cards which now affect the game from the very first round. At the same time, it's also more strategic as you can see future event cards and plan accordingly. Secondly, the mechanism used for choosing senate factions has been simplified and the factions themselves have many new, exciting functions and abilities. Thirdly, many politics cards have wider applications, allowing players to affect the game flow in more profound ways and giving them more flexibility in adjusting to the current in-game situation. Finally, the game and its rules have been generally streamlined and clarified with long card descriptions gone - &quot;End of Atlantis: Revised Edition&quot; is now fully language independent; you just need to master a few intuitive icons and keep on playing!<br/><br/>Think, scheme and manipulate, and use every trick and tool at your disposal to secure your place among the survivors of the New Land &mdash; and whatever you do, remember that every alliance is easily broken in the face of the apocalyptic disaster that awaits just beyond the horizon!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "German first edition"], "name": "End of Atlantis: Revised Edition", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Area Control / Area Influence", "Auction/Bidding", "Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "average": "6.23368", "usersrated": "38", "age": "10"}, "147932": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2666855.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Friedemann Friese"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Lars-Arne \"Maura\" Kalusky"], "boardgamepublisher": ["2F-Spiele"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2666855_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Expansion for Base-game", "Industry / Manufacturing"], "description": "Power Grid: Taxes (Funkenschlag: Steuern) is a promotional card for Power Grid that was first available in October 2013 for a donation at the 2F-Spiele booth during Spiel 2013.

One is that the group is hired to protect The Raven carrying cargo between two sky docks. Perhaps pirates, air elementals, flying creatures, or even dragons attack them in the air as they travel. Or maybe the pirates wait till they land at the sky dock to make their move and attack them while they are moving cargo from the ship to the dock. You could also have the Player Characters hired to infiltrate a sky dock and sneak on board The Raven and &ldquo;liberate&rdquo; the cargo. Maybe the Player Characters are even shocked to find out that their &ldquo;cargo&rdquo; was actually slaves. Of course, there could always be a twist.

DramaScape&trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.<br/><br/>This product includes an Arabian market in a Merchant&rsquo;s Quarter, and a more Poor Quarter where seedier business is conducted. In the Merchant&rsquo;s Quarter, the streets were laid out far in advance of construction and are kept clean and well maintained.<br/><br/>The four main guard outposts protect the two main roads leading to the market and are on constant lookout for thieves in the crowd and climbing the walls. The Arabian market is a cluster of shops, tables, and stalls where merchants hock their wares.<br/><br/>The market is always packed with customers during business hours. The merchants sell just about anything and everything legal that you can think of.<br/><br/>In sharp contrast, the Poor Quarter is a chaotic urban sprawl that is dirty and cluttered. The only area that is clean is a guard outpost to the northeast next to a small park where the guards try to keep the poor out of the Merchant&rsquo;s Quarter. Buildings are seemingly placed wherever the builders felt like it, connected by a maze of back alleys and wooden planks used to walk from rooftop to rooftop. Business is conducted here too, in grungy stalls, in dark alleyways, inside buildings away from prying eyes, and on rooftop tables and storefronts. In this seedier part of town anything could be sold, fenced goods, or even slaves.<br/><br/>There are a lot of adventures possible with this module. The Player Characters could be shopping at the Arabian market when thieves or cutpurses go after them or one of the merchants.<br/><br/>The merchant hires the Player Characters to go retrieve what is stolen, or the Player Characters go to retrieve their own goods, having to go into the Poor Quarter and find the thieves in their home turf. Or reverse the adventure, with the Player Characters going to the Poor Quarter and getting a job to steal from the merchants, assassinate a merchant, etc. and have to get through the guards and walls to do it. Perhaps the Player Characters are hired as guards to watch the outpost and they have to capture thieves or assassins before they can get to their merchant target.<br/><br/>Even if there are no planned adventures here in this city, this module can make an excellent base for a campaign. Using the Poor Quarter, you can plan out a small city&rsquo;s buildings. Twenty-one different building&rsquo;s insides can be anything the Game Master wants from forges to taverns to temples to guild houses.<br/><br/>"}, "147944": {"rpgdesigner": ["Steven J.

DramaScape&trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.<br/><br/>This module includes three crypt dungeons for use in any game. The first is a maze and dungeon full of coffins. The second is a pillared dungeon. The third is a shrine built into a volcano with a drawbridge that spans across a river of magma. Additionally, there is a tile page for the bridge down.<br/><br/>Game Masters can use these three large crypt maps in a variety of ways. The first crypt is a rather large dungeon maze. The left hand side of the map with its many small rooms and hallways is a great place to start with small encounters with undead, tomb robbers, carrion feeders, and other monsters. The right hand side of the map has a large room with many coffins and skeleton-filled mass graves. This room is great for an epic encounter with an evil necromancer, with massive waves of undead coming out of the charnel pits or coffins, fighting a bandit leader and his grave robbers, or even a huge carrion feeding mother monster laying eggs in the chamber. These doors are usually barred from the outside, unless something has opened them, like the grave robbing thieves, the necromancer&rsquo;s hulking undead assistant has smashed them open, etc.<br/><br/>The second crypt dungeon with the multiple pillars makes for a great setting piece for an epic large fight at the bottom of a dungeon. Pillars provide cover for archers and magicians and plenty of shadows and concealment for stealthy characters to sneak around and flank enemies. The open middle of the room is a great spot for warriors to enter a grand melee.<br/><br/>The third crypt makes for a tough encounter because it is a narrow bridge that the Player Characters must fight on, making ranged and spell attacks the biggest part of the encounter and falling off the bridge to the river of fire is almost certain incineration. On the other side is a shrine with a demon dog idol. What creatures worship this demon dog? Do they offer this idol sacrifices? Perhaps they are about to sacrifice a person to the demon dog, releasing them from a steel cage and leading them up the scaffolding to the demon dog idol&rsquo;s head. It is up to the Player Characters to stop the sacrifice. The guards will try to stop them from reaching the other side by wheeling the drawbridge up, so the Player Characters will need to incapacitate them before they can succeed at lifting it up to get to the other side. Then they&rsquo;ll need to deal with the head priest, the executioner, and the other worshipers.<br/><br/>This product makes an excellent additional resource for our Ossuary module, as these maps can be laid down so that the entrance is across from the northern bridge exit of that module as an additional area to explore.<br/><br/>"}, "147945": {"rpgdesigner": ["Steven J.

DramaScape&trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.<br/><br/>The Observatory includes a mystic's observatory tower with first and second floor and a roof with a telescope. The entrance to the tower is the front door in the southeast on the first floor. The first floor has an intricate pattern of runes in concentric circles around the center armillary sphere with its lower half visible.<br/><br/>The second floor has a pattern of wooden planks arranged in a hexagonal manner around the center armillary sphere with its upper half visible.<br/><br/>The roof has a telescope that can be moved up and down and left and right by two different gear systems.<br/><br/>One adventure with The Observatory could be the Player Characters find a treasure map that leads to an old tower on an adventure or perhaps sold to them in a local village. The treasure map indicates that the treasure is on the first floor, but that the telescope must be properly aligned first, and then the armillary sphere activated.<br/><br/>The first step is getting to the roof and aligning the telescope. The runes on the roof can be used for the first puzzle. Many of them are shaped like arrows, and if the Player Characters turn the gears toward them and in the proper way up or down, the puzzle might be solved. For example, the treasure map could indicate that the bow and arrow like rune in the southwest is the key rune. So the telescope needs to be pointed to the northeast with an angle up of approximated 30 degrees.<br/><br/>If the Player Characters think to look, they can note that the telescope is facing a certain celestial body such as Mars when they are finished aligning it. The second step is activating the armillary sphere, which is a puzzle on the first floor. For example, the Player Characters need to move all the furniture out of the second outermost ring to the wall, and then must stand on the circles from where they had moved the furniture.<br/><br/>Once they accomplish these two tasks, the armillary sphere whirls to life and moves faster and faster until suddenly a portal appears. From the portal could step out a demon, devil, trans-dimensional horror, alien, or any other being the Game Master would like. The creature may offer them treasure to fool them into letting their guard down, but had no intention of giving them anything.<br/><br/>The creature needs to kill the Player Characters. Only their blood smeared on the pattern of the twelve red runes on the floor can break the seal that has kept it in this place for millennia. Once the creature is defeated, the armillary sphere stops spinning and shatters revealing stairs underneath it that lead to a lower level. This lower level could be filled with traps and more puzzles but at the end is the treasure.<br/><br/>"}, "147946": {"rpgdesigner": ["Steven J.

DramaScape&trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.<br/><br/>Wagon&rsquo;s Roll includes a collection of carriages, covered and uncovered wagons, and carts with and without horses and oxen to pull them set on a grass field or cobblestone background allowing the module to be used in either wilderness or urban environments. There is a well-traveled path in a grass field with some surrounding forest and a cobbled city street surrounded by buildings that can be used to set up encounters with the carriages.  There are also obstacles such as overturned carriages, a dead ox, rocks, logs, barricades, etc. that can be used to set up a roadblock or as components of a chase scene.<br/><br/>Wagon&rsquo;s Roll can be used to set up a ton of encounters both in the wilderness and in town. The classic adventure is a caravan guard mission. The Player Characters are hired by a merchant to guard a collection of wagons to its destination where its goods will be sold. Bandits and thieves may be after the goods. In the crowded city streets before leaving town, they could set up a blockade with an overturned wagon. With the caravan stopped, they then climb out from the windows of nearby buildings rappelling and then leaping onto the top of the carriages. They then start a fight on the top of the wagons, trying to knock out the drivers, and perhaps hijack the carriages to another destination.  Once the caravan makes it to the wilderness, bandits on horseback may chase after them, leading to a chase scene using the obstacles. A different wilderness encounter could be like the one in town, they set up a road obstacle, and then ambush the caravan from the cover of the forest.<br/><br/>The Player Characters may even have an investigation scene when they find a dead ox and a flipped over carriage and try to figure out what happened to them. Bandits? Or something more sinister? The first thing to investigate would be how did the ox die? The ox could have died from being trampled, poisoned, diseased, or even famine. The second thing to investigate would be the condition of the carriage. The carriage could have been flipped, crashed into a tree, burned, crushed, etc. The Game Master could use this as an adventure hook or even a subtle warning of a possible danger later down the road.<br/><br/>Another encounter would be the Player Characters are wandering through the wilderness and happen upon a friendly traveling merchant in his carriage willing to sell the Player Characters some goods. This gives them a chance to supply on the road and continue an adventure without returning to town.<br/><br/>Even if not using Wagon&rsquo;s Roll to set up an adventure, Game Masters and Player Characters alike will find this module extremely useful. If a Player Character buys a small cart in town, he can get one of the small handcarts or wheelbarrows in this module for carrying extra goods. If a Player Character buys a large cart, he can get one of the larger carts and will likely need to buy some oxen or horses to pull the cart around for carrying larger amounts of extra goods.<br/><br/>"}, "147947": {"rpgdesigner": ["Steven J.

Two of these pillars have gargoyles resting atop them,  with a third gargoyle statue in the north center of the map.<br/><br/>The grounds are no longer well maintained, with the paths through the cemetery a mix of stone, gravel, and dirt intermixed with wilted grass and weeds choking  out the paths and giving the grounds a chaotic and uneven appearance.<br/><br/>The many trees and bushes have long since died, but have been brought back  to a strange sort of life by the hundreds of spider webs that now cover them.<br/><br/>Multiple rows of gravestones are in the western and eastern parts of the map  and some surrounding the main center path in the south leading to the mausoleum on a hill in the middle of the map.<br/><br/>Large rocks, two stone statues watching the path, and a wilted tree line the path  from the lych-gate to the mausoleum. The four corners of the map have larger  crypts and tombs, some cracked and in poor condition. A gazebo with moss  growing on the top is also in the southwest.<br/><br/>The old cemetery makes a great location for a necromancer to find corpses  to raise from the dead. The fact that mourners rarely visit the place is another  plus, meaning it keeps their activities away from the public and prying eyes.<br/><br/>This makes the old cemetery the perfect spot for a zombie or ghoul infestation  to fight off. We&rsquo;ve included some zombies and ghouls for just this use.<br/><br/>Perhaps there are powerful creatures buried in the mausoleum such as vampires  or mummies. They leave the mausoleum at night to feed on the living, always  needing to return to the mausoleum before the sun rises. A rash of night killings  could occur in the local village, with victims drained of life energy and having  a shriveled appearance when found. The Player Characters investigate and  find out about the old cemetery, entering during the day to put a stop to  the killings and needing to fight off vampires or life stealing mummies.<br/><br/>"}, "147948": {"rpgdesigner": ["Steven J.

The sixth location is three shops side by side, a futon seller, a container seller, and a fruit seller with a warehouse behind them for storing stock. The container seller could also be selling merchandise hidden in the containers as well. The seventh location is a dojo. The eighth location is an exclusive soba diner serving thin buckwheat noodles in various ways such as morisoba, zarusoba, and yakisoba. The ninth location is a mill. The final map is an upstairs area that is entered by stairways accessible via the street. Its decor matches the soba diner strongly and could be used as an additional dining area for patrons or the residency of the owner and employees of the soba diner. It could also be used as the upstairs area of the two larger shop locations or even the mill as well.<br/><br/>These maps can be used in a variety of settings from medieval to modern. Street side stands are likely to be seen popping up during festivals even in modern times.  They make great places for the Player Character&rsquo;s day-to-day activities. Places to live and sleep, eat and drink, buy and sell items, as well as train or work.<br/><br/>"}, "147952": {"rpgdesigner": ["Steven J.

The skulls are from all the fallen heroes who have tried and failed to gain the legendary treasure by challenging the beast. The lava pit is a place of sacrifice suitable for games ranging from fantasy to modern pulp adventure. Villagers on a volcanic island use the lava pit to throw in sacrifices to the fire god to remain calm.  Or villagers rely heavily on sacrifices to a whole pantheon of gods to appease them. Finally it could be a place for a secret society to perform sacrifices and blood magic for their arcane arts.

The ghostly ship is a derelict mirror of the Player Character&rsquo;s own ship. Its crew is composed of zombies that appear as rotting corpses that bear the same faces as the crew. The ghastly captain has the same face as the captain of the group&rsquo;s vessel. He warns them of a fate worse than death if they do not heed his advice. Turn back from the storm and return from whence you came else you suffer the same fate.

This sloop has to come out of the continent and return to sea sometime!&rdquo;<br/><br/>This product includes the top deck only of two ships, a smuggler&rsquo;s sloop and a nineteenth century screw-propelled steam ship with three sailing masts called The Wave Cutter. The area around the ship has been left blank for the PDF file to save on ink for printing at home. For the Print on Demand (POD) file, this surrounding area is replaced with water.<br/><br/>The sloop is intended for use in pirate themed or colonial games. The sloop can be used in any fantasy game that includes cannons as well (it has six cannons on the top deck). The screw-propelled steam ship can be used in a steampunk or Victorian era setting, as its main period of use was the nineteenth century to the early twentieth century. It can be used in a late period pirate game as well, perhaps as a prototype of the new vessel.<br/><br/>The sloop makes an excellent starting vessel for adventurers in a game focusing on high seas adventure and island exploration. The sloop can travel up rivers and channels to travel inland from the coast. The vessel also includes two dinghies that can be used to travel further inland via small canals and streams or carried overland till needed.<br/><br/>The sloop can be used for a smuggling adventure. The group can be smugglers or they can be privateers trying to stop them. The smugglers are using their mobility to try and evade the privateers. They go inland to escape them and try to chart a path through the island to escape. It is up to the Game Master if there is a route through the island. The privateers may eventually land on the island looking for the smugglers, but prefer to wait by the last river the sloop entered. If the sloop must turn around, they must somehow outrun the privateers or defeat them to get away.<br/><br/>The screw-propelled steamer could be a prize as a prototype near the end of the age of piracy. The group can be guards for the vessel on its maiden voyage or pirates out to collect a rare prize. Either way, The Wave Cutter is on a journey to prove it can out perform the older paddle-wheel steam ships. Complications arise when the ship&rsquo;s propeller has a mechanical problem with a calm wind. Here is where the pirate&rsquo;s strike. The player characters need to fix the propeller malfunction and get the ship moving in time or end up fighting the pirates off (or both at the same time!). After the malfunction and fighting off the pirates, The Wave Cutter returns to port. Another adventure idea is that The Wave Cutter is attempting to be the first screw-propelled steamer to cross the Atlantic Ocean and make the transatlantic journey from North America to Europe (or vice versa). They must fight off pirates, propeller malfunctions, and other adversities to make the trip.<br/><br/>"}, "147965": {"rpgdesigner": ["Steven J.

DramaScape&trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.<br/><br/>This product features a large-scale panoramic view of a modern city with four city blocks represented. The map features over 40 buildings.<br/> This map can be used as a base city for a modern setting, the place where the Player Characters live, eat, work, and sleep when they are not on adventures which may be an excellent setting for downtime in modern-based or super hero games.<br/> This dynamic map allows for larger scale adventures and scenarios than normal.<br/><br/>The first scenario is a chase scene, where either the Player Characters are being chased by Game Master Characters out to get them or vice versa. The Player Characters could also be tailing Game Master Characters who if they don&rsquo;t notice the Player Characters first will lead them to an important meeting. For example, the city parking lot where a deal is going down in the middle of the night. The four city blocks have several hazards; other vehicles on the roads, the center traffic signal, and stop signs at the end of the main roads. These can cause complications in the chase, and even bring police into the chase for not following the traffic laws. There are also a couple of back alleys for cars to try to slip through and sneak around, one of them being a dead end.<br/><br/>The second scenario is a monster rampaging through the city. Maybe the Player Characters are a team of super heroes coming in to fight a gigantic, super villain created monster intent on destroying the city. The humongous creature sends cars flying, debris tumbling down from buildings, and wreaks havoc upon the city. The super heroes have to save as many people as they can and somehow defeat the ginormous monstrosity at the same time. Perhaps the Player Characters are the massive monsters and the Game Master is controlling police and military forces (or even superheroes or other huge monsters) intent on stopping them from annihilating the city.<br/><br/>The third scenario is a military assault scenario. This city holds an important objective for two different military armies, and they roll into it at one of the four roads leading into the city featuring an array of tanks and armored personal carriers. One of the army&rsquo;s goals is to protect and defend the objective building, and the other army&rsquo;s goals could be to either take over or destroy the objective building. The objective building could be a hospital actively treating soldiers, a TV station that is blasting out propaganda, a hotel where a VIP is staying, etc. The Player Characters could be an elite unit dropped onto one of the roof of the objective building by helicopter. The elite unit&rsquo;s job may be to infiltrate the key building and then either extract or eliminate the VIP. Maybe it&rsquo;s their job to secure and defend the building or use explosives to blow it up before escaping. Perhaps they are taking control of the highest rooftop in the city in order to lend sniper support to the battle below.<br/><br/>You can either print it out with our easy to print instructions or use in any VTT software.<br/><br/>This map product is a full-color, 40 x 30 inch, 4 City Blocks.

The buildings range from merely cracked to a huge swathe of the roof missing to completely shattered. The streets and sidewalks are filled with debris, tires, garbage, bricks, and even downed telephone poles. The former military base in the northeast glows with a bright green sludge emanating from the buildings. Empty barrels lie scattered around the facility that held what before the city was ruined?<br/><br/>The first question to answer when using this module is what happened to make the city destroyed? A tornado, hurricane, earthquake, typhoon, or other natural disaster? A military action ranging from conventional to biological to chemical or even nuclear weapons to take out the military base? An experiment gone awry at the military base causing massive destruction to the base and surrounding city?<br/><br/>The Game Master should decide an answer to that question, and then its up to the Player Characters to investigate what destroyed the city. The Player Characters will likely need to investigate the military base to the northeast, and might want to come prepared perhaps with environmental suits to protect against radioactive, biological, or chemical exposure. Perhaps on the way to the military base, the Player Characters are attacked by the results of the failed experiment, mutants, oozes, zombies, or worse. The mutants may even wish to capture the Player Characters, take them back to the military base, and make them into mutants like themselves.<br/><br/>You can either print it out with our easy to print instructions or use in any VTT software.<br/><br/>"}, "147984": {"rpgdesigner": ["Steven J.

The warehouse and loading docks are enclosed by a stone wall with barbed wire at the top. The only entry point is a gate to the east to get into the loading docks and then the warehouse.<br/><br/>The Player Characters could be lured here by two things. One is the rumors of weapons, possibly even missiles stored in the warehouse for them to acquire. The other rumor is one about a large iron vault stuffed with cash or treasure to steal. Either way, the Player Characters are lured to the warehouse to get either better weapons or valuables to procure more equipment.<br/><br/>The Player Characters will likely need careful planning to extract the goods. Is it possible to scale the walls and cut the fences with wire cutters under the cover of night? Do they stakeout the warehouse and then stalk the A10 transport van to hijack it and disguise themselves as warehouse employees? Bust through the front gate? If this modern warehouse has advanced modern weapons and/or cash to protect, what kind of security and defenses does the facility have? If the crates do have missiles&hellip;is there something inside the facility that can use them?<br/><br/>Alternatively, the Player Characters could be hired as security guards to protect the warehouse.

The Vanguard shuttle is a solar-powered shuttle used for short trips between space stations, starports, planets, moons, ships, asteroids, or other satellites within a solar system. The Vanguard&rsquo;s interior includes a cockpit, a main body, and a rear section, with a detachable underbelly cargo container. Three cargo container pods are included for use.  The first is a passenger pod for missions with an extended duration, the second is a cargo pod for hauling goods, and the final pod can be used as a containment pod for transporting prisoners or as a dropship for transporting marines to the surface of a planet.<br/><br/>The Vanguard can be used in a lot of ways to bring the Player Characters into a scenario. The cargo pods make it a versatile ship; able to transport crew, cargo, prisoners, slaves, marines, weapons, armor, or anything else the Game Master can think of. The Player Characters can be the crew of the vessel, the marines, hired hands for guarding the ship as security guards, workers hired on to move cargo, the prisoners, the slaves, even stowaways in the access ducts, or any other reason the Game Master can think of for them being on the ship.<br/><br/>The Vanguard is useful as a ship for Player Characters to use as a base of operations to explore a solar system.  Solar-powered, the vessel may be cheap to buy, especially in more advanced settings that have access to warp drives, gates, and other much faster means of travel. In this case, it is suitable as a starting ship for the Player Characters to use with the passenger pod.<br/>Depending on why the Player Characters are on-board, many adventures are possible. If the Player Characters are prisoners or slaves, maybe an electrical power outage releases them from their bonds and they have to fight their way through guards to escape pods or even take over the vessel from within. The power outage could be caused by hackers paid by pirates or gangsters who wanted to bust out their guys at the main prison and have a plan in mind for the Vanguard shuttle. Maybe the shuttle continues its destination, the prison world/space station/mine etc., for a surprising break out attempt with the Player Characters and other prisoners or slaves dressed as the crew of the Vanguard as a disguise. Or they can be the guards trying to contain the prisoner break out on the ship.<br/><br/>Pirates who are after the cargo could assault the ship as well. This leads to a space battle possibly ending with pirates boarding the ship and the Player Characters trying to fight them off and keep them from stealing the weapons, armor, or other goods on board. <br/>As Marines, the officers brief them on their mission, and then the Game Master gets the fun of describing an orbital drop to them from this point of view and their deployment in a hot zone fighting who knows what, aliens, monsters, other races, or more.<br/><br/>"}, "147987": {"rpgdesigner": ["Steven J.

Stone trenches act as canals and funnel water to the mill and downstream. The house and mill were built on higher ground. A partially standing stonewall is all that remains of the warehouse that once stored the grain. There are remains of an encampment here; a fire pit has been built in this area. A large rock to the north, the stonewall, and the forest surrounding this spot make it a good area to hide the light of a fire.<br/><br/>The area hasn&rsquo;t been used in quite some time, making this a good hiding place for people familiar with the wilderness such as brigands, bandits, scouts, or even rangers. <br/>When visiting a local nearby village, the Player Characters are told about the old ruined mill. The miller was found downstream, dead of drowning. When the bravest villagers went to investigate, they found the mill wheel stopped up by strange seaweed. When they later turned up drowned downstream, the villagers became deathly afraid of the place, and made up a rumor about the ghost of the miller to frighten their kids to stay away from the area. The farmer may tell the Player Characters about the ghost of the miller and his wrathful spirit as well as having seen lights up in the hills during recent nights.<br/><br/>If the Player Characters go to investigate, they may find a group of bandits, brigands, scouts, or rangers. The bandits or brigands could have been using the area as a hideout from the law or as a staging point for raiding caravans on the road. Scouts may have been sent by a local army to look for weak points along the border with a foreign land or to scout the village for a takeover attempt. Rangers may be here hunting the bandits or brigands in the area.<br/><br/>One twist is that they find the brigands, bandits, scouts, or rangers, except they are all dead near the tree line, with the embers of their fire cooling. The Player Characters must investigate what killed them. A search of their bodies may reveal the cause of death; strangulation if they have any sort of Anatomy, Physiology, or Healing skills. Something killed these men, and it is up there stalking the Player Characters as their next victims. A stealthy plant or aquatic monster with a preference for strangulation and/or drowning is the suggestion for the adversary.<br/><br/>"}, "147988": {"rpgdesigner": ["Steven J.

The Player Characters are given mission orders to free the prisoners of war while the Allies make an assault on the castle as a distraction.

The Morgue is a good map to use as a backdrop for an investigation such as an autopsy to discover how someone died in a detective game. The Morgue excels as a centerpiece to a Horror-themed adventure.<br/><br/>Adventures in the morgue can start with bells ringing, as someone who they thought was dead is found to be still alive. They bring in the mistakenly deceased family to apologize profusely for their error and to reunite them with their dead relative. But when they enter the morgue, something is clearly off about their relative, unable to speak except in grunts and moans, and he even begins to lunge at his relatives and the medical staff.<br/><br/>The attendants and relatives run screaming from the room, barring the door. A frantic head nurse calls the police describing the man as going berserk probably as a result of shock.

He throws three dice and use two of them to choose an action, and then use the other die to asign materials to a structure. To build a structure you choose an action and deploy resources in that build. The player must build mandatory structures (radio, vital systems, spaceport, etc.) before a specific turn or he'll lost the game. In addition he can build other structures (factory, control station, missile base) to gain victory points and to defend colony from alien attack or asteroids.<br/><br/>2013 Solitaire Print and Play Contest results:<br/><br/>Best Greyscale Printed Game<br/>1st place - Colony 9 by Santiago Eximeno<br/><br/>Best Medium Sized Game<br/>2nd place - Colony 9 by Santiago Eximeno<br/><br/>Best Deck / Pool Building Mechanic<br/>1st place - Colony 9 by Santiago Eximeno<br/><br/>"}, "147995": {"rpgdesigner": ["St\u00e9phane Daudier"], "rpgitemversion": ["First printing"], "statistics": [], "name": "L\u00e9gendes Celtiques", "rpgartist": ["Didier Guiserix", "Lefko", "St\u00e9phane Truffer"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2290693.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "10", "rpgissuearticle": ["Le jour o\u00f9 le ciel tomba"], "rpggenre": ["History (Ancient)", "History (Britain / Ireland)", "Mythology / Folklore"], "rpgpublisher": ["Descartes Editeur"], "rpg": ["L\u00e9gendes Celtiques"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2290693_t.jpg", "description": "User description :<br/>This the first and only edition of this game which is a member of the Premi\u00e8res L\u00e9gendes family of french roleplaying games published by Descartes Editeur in the 1980s.<br/><br/>The content of the box consists of two books :<br/><br/><br/>     The 188 pages rulebook contains the game system.Based upon L\u00e9gendes, it presents :<br/>         A lighter - but still very complete - character creation part<br/>         Simplified game rules<br/>         A bestiary<br/>         A spell list<br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>     The 64 pages civilization book with the following parts :<br/>         Everyday life in the celtic world<br/>         Celtic heroes, both real and legendary<br/>         Celtic religions : gods of Gaul and of Ireland<br/>         The art of war of the celtic people and their weaponry<br/>         A scenario with &quot;ready to play&quot; characters<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>"}, "147996": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Darth Rimmer", "Travis Watkins"], "average": "6.75", "poll": [], "name": "Night of the Saucers", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Co-operative Play", "Hand Management", "Player Elimination", "Point to Point Movement", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2882883_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Michael Norman", "Darth Rimmer", "Travis Watkins", "Daryl Toh Liem Zhan"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Imp House LLC."], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2882883.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Science Fiction"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "The year is 1984. Your city is under siege. Grey alien soldiers are everywhere. Alien rule is immanent. It's up to you and the teenage trouble making Task Force to save humanity. The Night of the Saucers is upon us, and Earth's only hope just got out of detention.<br/><br/>Night of the Saucers is a collaborative game for 1 to 4 players, ages 8 and up. The average game lasts about an hour, but its not uncommon for a game to stretch towards the two hour mark. It all depends on how many missions you choose to complete and how many cards you decide to include in the alien deck.<br/><br/>Each player controls 3 high school students that are stuck in detention when aliens attacked and take over the city. Now it's up to the students to take the city back. You must move about the board searching buildings for supplies to fight the aliens with. At the end of every turn, each player draws an alien card that deploys new aliens onto the board and directs the movements of the alien army. Sometimes devastating Saucer Strikes will be drawn that blow up the buildings tiles and everything on them. This makes the board treacherous to navigate and supplies harder to come by. The way you win is by completing Task Force missions or by surviving the alien deck.<br/><br/>Night of the Saucers is a fun and easy game with cool miniatures set in an 80s action-movie inspired environment. We like to say it's like Red Dawn meets Independence Day with the Breakfast Club.
