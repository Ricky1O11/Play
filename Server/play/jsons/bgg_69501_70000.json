So are all of your opponents.<br/><br/>The daily life of the hermits is represented by tricks of cards, and there will typically be more than one trick in play at a time. The goal is to avoid taking tricks with personality cards in them. Tricks that don't have personalities in them don't matter one way or the other.<br/><br/>The above description is from the Decktet Book, where the game first appeared.<br/><br/>Hermit is a game akin to Hearts where players are attempting to avoid taking cards that are worth points. Rather than a single suit being avoided, Hermit requires that you do not win tricks which contain &quot;personality&quot; cards, one of the three sub-types of cards in the Decktet, which represent a person following you home and thus ruining your perfect life of solitude.<br/><br/>Regardless of the number of players, tricks are played open to the table. On a player's turn they must add a card from their hand to a trick with the requirement that the card being played shares at least one suit with the last played card on that trick. If they cannot meet that requirement they must use a card to start a new trick. If the card they play is the highest rank in the trick the entire trick moves in front of them. Thus any new tricks always start in front of the player opening them.<br/><br/>When a fourth card is added to a trick it is &quot;closed&quot; and the cards are captured by whomever the trick is in front of. If on a player's turn there are no available tricks, including the first turn of the game, each player simultaneously starts a new trick and that player then takes their turn, in effect allowing them to play two cards in a row. When the last player places their last card any unclosed tricks are discarded and each personality card taken counts its rank for scoring with Crowns being rank 10.<br/><br/>When one player reaches a predetermined score, typically 66 or 100, or a certain number of deals are completed the game is over and the player with the fewest points is the loneliest and thus the winner.<br/><br/>Special rules exist regarding Aces and Crowns as well as a Shoot the Moons/Suns variant, a &quot;House Party&quot; variant, and rules for 2-player Hermit games which incorporates a &quot;Cottage&quot; and laying off throughout the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Decktet Book"], "age": "0", "name": "Hermit", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Trick-taking"], "average": "6.59", "usersrated": "10", "boardgamefamily": ["Decktet Games"]}, "69638": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic738724.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["P.

Actions performed are similar to the boardgame and marked on a player card. Of the three dice rolled, one is chosen, one is passed to the next player and one is discarded.<br/><br/>Phase 3: one of three Person dice (depending on the period) is rolled and the player may choose to hire that person for the round performing that ability.<br/><br/>Phase 4: the plague check is determined for all players and the Notre Dame bonus is taken.<br/><br/>Files:<br/>Downloadable files include artwork for all dice faces, player cards and instructions for play.

The game is developed by Intelligent Systems and released by Nintendo in 2005. AW:DS is like the other Advance Wars games a turn-based tactic war game. <br/>In Advance Wars each side battles the other using ground, air and naval units. These units can be purchased using money that is received based on the number of buildings controlled. The goal is to either wipe out all the enemy units or to capture the enemy base. In campaign mode there are many levels with variations on both the goal of a level as well as on the basic gameplay.<br/><br/>AW:DS features the following game modes:<br/>- Campaign mode: A story driven series of levels.<br/>- War room: Battling against computer-controlled opponents. Options include the number of opponents (2, 3, 4 or Dual Front) and the use of skills.<br/>- Versus: Multi-player mode for up to 4 players.<br/>- Survival: Play a series of maps with one of three constraints: Number of turns, playing time or funds.<br/>- Combat: A series of maps featuring real-time gameplay instead of the usual turn-based gameplay. In Wireless mode this game mode can be played by up to 8 players<br/><br/>Apart from that you can buy additional maps with earned points, collect 300 different medals for achieving certain goals and design your own levels and share them with other owners of the game.<br/><br/>The game is very similar to the previous Advance War games, but it is well produced and very complete.<br/>Some of the new features in AW:DS include:<br/>- Skills: The possibility to choose certain skills per CO. The skills to choose from and the maximum number of skills usable per CO depend on the CO's rank. The rank goes up based on experience points. There are skills for increasing defence/offence, increase funding, lower production costs, etc.<br/>- Dual Front: Some battles takes place on two different fronts at the same time.<br/>- Tag Battle: The use of two CO's to command the troops (player can switch between CO's at the end of a turn).<br/><br/>"}, "69653": {"poll": [], "name": "Advance Wars: Days of Ruin", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Australian DS edition", "English/European DS edition", "Nintendo 3DS (Japanese Club Nintendo Platinum Reward) eShop edition", "North American Nintendo DS edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic733240.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Advance Wars"], "usersrated": "97", "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Intelligent Systems"], "videogamefranchise": ["Nintendo Wars"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo 3DS", "Nintendo DS"], "videogamehonor": ["2009 British Academy Game Awards Best Strategy Game of the Year Nominee", "2009 D.I.C.E.

As part of a larger effort, the 11th Worcestershire Battalion, 78th Brigade, 22nd Division aimed to capture &quot;06&quot;, a strongpoint of the Bulgarian 9th Division on &quot;Pip Ridge&quot; just east of Lake Doiran in Macedonia. At 2145, after days of intermittent shelling, the preparatory barrage ceased and the officers' shrill whistles rose from the din. British troops filtered down into Hana Ravine just before bounding up the slope to &quot;06&quot;.<br/><br/>Schneiders at Juvincourt<br/>As part of the Nivelle Offensive, Commandant Louis Bossut led five &quot;Special Artillery&quot; groups of 16 Schneider tanks each into German lines near Berry-Au-Bac at 0600. Groupment Bossut crossed the first German trench line with infantry against light resistance. But nagging artillery fires and mechanical failures began to nibble away at his force. Four kilometers later, Bossut swung northward to cross the second German trench line with his 60 remaining tanks and the 151st Infantry Regiment. After crossing around 0900, Bossut split his force sending two groups north toward Juvincourt, two more west toward Mauchamp and one south toward the Aisne.<br/><br/>The Lost Battalion<br/>On 2 October 1918, elements of the U.S. 77th &quot;Liberty&quot; Division from New York attacked north into the Argonne Forest. Major Whittlesey's force of two battalions from the 308th Infantry and two platoons of the 306th Machine Gun outpaced neighboring American units by penetrating a full kilometer into German lines. At dusk, Whittlesey's men dug in along the north slope of a valley between a road at the top and a stream at the bottom. Company K of the 307th joined the following morning. Seeing that this force had outpaced its flank protection, the Germans slowly encircled the &quot;Lost Battalion&quot;, in a pocket about 500 meters east of Moulin de Charlevaux. At 3 PM on October 3, the Germans launched their first attack.<br/><br/>Go to Hell!<br/>After 5 days of siege, the Lost Battalion was out of bandages, drinking from the Charlevaux Brook, and coughing on the stench of the rotting corpses that surrounded them. the Germans sent an American POW back to his comrades with a letter offering to accept an American surrender. According to legend, Major Whittlesey spat back, &quot;Go to Hell!&quot;<br/><br/>Kaiserschlacht<br/>The Kaiser's Battle began at 0435 with an unprecedented artillery bombardment of gas, smoke and high explosive rounds. About 9,955 tubes of all sizes rained over 1,100,000 shells across 40 miles of frontage. At 0940 the firing stopped; Stosstruppen immediately sprang from their shell holes as German regulars emerged from trenches close behind. Near Grugies not far from St. Quentin, Germany's 238th division slammed into Britain's 36th Ulster amid dense fog and lingering smoke. The recently arrived Ulster men had just taken over French positions and had yet to fully implement the new defense in depth doctrine.<br/><br/>War of Machines<br/>During the Second Battle of Cambrai, British troops of Byng's third Army broke through the Hindenburg Line to &quot;the green fields beyond.&quot; Leading the way, tanks of the 12th Battalion helped XVII Corps capture Niergnies. Just east of the town, Captain Roe's tank, L16, paused at Mont Neuve Farm. there he spotted four MIVs coming his way from the east. C Company - he thought.<br/><br/>Combined Arms<br/>After Ludendorff's Operation Georgette bogged down in the north, he made a thrust for Amiens. At dawn on April 24th, thirteen German tanks lumbered forward over a gloomy moonscape with infantry close behind. After plowing through Britain's 173rd Brigade, they covered 4,000 yards to reach the Cachy Switch Line, a stitch work arrangement of incomplete trenches between Villers Bretonneux and Cachy. At about that time, Captain Brown led three Mark IVs to the Cachy Switch Line with orders to hold at all costs.<br/><br/>(source: user's description)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "name": "In the Trenches: Through Mud and Blood", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "6.56", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["In The Trenches"]}, "69681": {"poll": [], "name": "SSX Tricky", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European PlayStation 2 (Platinum) edition", "English/European PlayStation 2 edition", "English/European Xbox (Classics) edition", "French Xbox edition", "German GameCube edition", "Japanese GameCube edition", "Japanese Playstation 2 edition", "Japanese Xbox edition", "North American Game Boy Advance edition", "North American GameCube edition", "North American PlayStation 2 (Greatest Hits) edition", "North American PlayStation 2 edition", "North American Xbox (Platinum Hits) edition", "North American Xbox edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic757023.jpg", "videogameseries": ["SSX"], "videogametheme": ["Sports - Snowboarding"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogamecharacter": ["Broderick Ford", "Edward Wachowski", "Elise Riggs", "Jean-Paul Arsenault", "Kaori Nishidake", "Mackenzie Fraser", "Marisol Diez Delgado", "Martin Stieber", "Moby Jones", "Psymon Stark", "Zoe Payne"], "usersrated": "98", "videogamedeveloper": ["EA Canada", "Electronic Arts (EA)"], "videogamefranchise": ["Best of Platinum Hits (Select Best Selling Xbox Games, US)", "EA Sports", "EA Sports BIG", "Platinum Range (Best Selling PlayStation Games, PAL)"], "videogameplatform": ["Game Boy Advance", "GameCube", "PlayStation 2", "Xbox"], "videogamehonor": ["2002 D.I.C.E.

Persona 3 was originally published in 2006 on the PlayStation 2 by Atlus in Japan; the North American release of the game was delayed due to issues with the publication of the official art book. An add-on disc entitled Persona 3 FES, containing a &quot;director's cut&quot; of the original game, as well as a new epilogue, was released alongside Persona 3 in Japan in 2007, and in 2008 in other territories. A PlayStation Portable version of Persona 3, titled Persona 3 Portable was released in Japan on November 1, 2009, and will be released in North America on July 6, 2010. The remake adds the ability to play as a female protagonist, new story elements and music, and a new interface designed for the PSP.<br/><br/>In Persona 3, the player takes the role of a male high-school student who joins the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad (SEES), a group of students investigating the Dark Hour, a time period between one day and the next that few people are aware of. During the Dark Hour, the player enters Tartarus, a large tower containing Shadows, creatures that feed on the minds of humans. To fight the Shadows, each member of SEES is able to summon a Persona, a manifestation of a person's inner self. The game's most iconic feature is the method by which the members of SEES release their Personas: by firing a gun-like object called an Evoker at their head. In addition to the standard elements of role-playing games, Persona 3 includes elements of simulation games, as the game's protagonist progresses day by day through a school year, making friends and forming relationships that improve the strength of his Personas in battle. The North American release of Persona 3 includes the aforementioned art book, along with a selection of music from the official soundtrack.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Persona_3,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "69691": {"poll": [], "name": "Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European PlayStation 2 edition", "Japanese PlayStation 2 edition", "Japanese PlayStation 2 The Best edition", "Japanese PlayStation Vita edition", "North American PlayStation 2 edition", "North American PlayStation Vita edition", "PSN Playstation 3 Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic704956.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Shin Megami Tensei: Persona"], "videogametheme": ["Anime", "Romance / Relationships", "School"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogamecharacter": ["Chie Satonaka", "Kanji Tatsumi", "Yosuke Hanamura", "Yukiko Amagi"], "usersrated": "103", "videogamedeveloper": ["Atlus Co.

It is a spin-off of the Shin Megami Tensei series of video games; the main difference between Digital Devil Saga and the main series is the focus on specific characters rather than summoning demons to fight alongside your party. The story to Digital Devil Saga is continued with its direct sequel Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga 2.<br/><br/>Notable features of the game include the ability to shapeshift between demon and human forms in battle, and a return of the &quot;press turn&quot; battle system from Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne. A large difference between Nocturne and Digital Devil Saga is the ability to change equipped skills at will, instead of at level up. Unlike in Nocturne, unlearned skills are not lost forever, which allows for much greater character customization. The game features a &quot;Mantra&quot; system where Macca gained after battle can be used to download new Mantras at a saving terminal. Atma, gained by devouring enemies in battle, then allows the characters to Master these mantras, imparting new abilities.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Digital_Devil_Saga,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "69693": {"poll": [], "name": "Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga 2", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European PlayStation 2 edition", "English/UK PlayStation 2 Collector's edition", "North American PlayStation 2 edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic704950.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Digital Devil Saga"], "videogametheme": ["Anime", "Post-Apocalyptic", "Science Fiction"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogamecharacter": ["Argilla", "Cielo", "Gale (Shin Megami Tensei)", "Heat", "Serph"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Atlus Co.

They were released on February 27, 2001 in Japan, May 14, 2001 in North America, and October 5, 2001 in Europe for the Nintendo Game Boy Color. The game features a brighter color palette when played on a Nintendo Game Boy Advance in order to make up for the darkness of the screen, and a special shop is also made available.<br/><br/>After experimenting with porting the original The Legend of Zelda to the Game Boy Color, Yoshiki Okamoto's Flagship team began developing three interconnected Zelda games that could be played in any order. The complexity of this system led the team to cancel one game; the remaining two were adapted into Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages. The two games, released simultaneously, interact via a Game Link Cable and a password system.<br/><br/>In Seasons, the Triforce transports Link to the land of Holodrum, where he witnesses the kidnapping of Din, the Oracle of Seasons, by Onox. The main plot is revealed once the player completes both games. The player controls Link from an overhead perspective, using basic controls copied from The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening for the Game Boy.

There are no lineups to decide upon and no score sheets to fill out yet the game unfolds inning by inning with a key player and action being revealed along the way. While it can be used to add on to existing full play baseball games, such as Inside Pitch Baseball, it can also hold its own as a season replay game.<br/><br/>Each team is represented by a single chart that shows all of the possible players and how they effect scoring in an inning when called upon to deliver as a key player. It could be the 3rd string catcher that comes through or maybe your backup shortstop. One roll per inning gets you all the action plus all the pitchers stats for that inning.<br/><br/>All hitters are rated for, basically, runs created. This is how runs can be scored during an inning. They also have ratings for HR, 3B, 2B, SB and hits in general. How often a hitter is called upon is based on how many plate appearances he had during the season being replayed. The bigger the hit type, a HR beats a single, the better chance to have that big inning. How many runs a team scored in an inning during the year is recreated with Scoreboard as each team has its own scoring chart.<br/><br/>Pitchers are rated on H, K and BBs. They also have ratings which can cause runs to score in an inning or block potential runs from scoring. The pitchers' stay in the game relies upon how many hits, runs and walks he gives up in his stint. Deciding who pitches doesn't slow the game down as pitchers have start and relief ranges that you can use to &quot;coach&quot; the team.<br/><br/>Relievers are not left out of the mix as all their appearances and stats can be tracked as well. When to bring in a certain reliever is also covered with 7 different scoring/inning breakdowns that are based upon actual year appearances. Your middle guys will come in at the proper times and be effective (non-effective) just like the year the charts recreate.<br/><br/>While most stats are gathered during the game some loose ends must be accounted for at games' end. These are handled with each player given ranges to fill in those RBI and hit stats so that the score sheet comes out even.<br/><br/>You don't just roll for a final score in Scoreboard but you get the ebb and flow of the game broken down per inning. Sometimes your less than stellar players will need to come through in a pinch recreating the excitement of a play-by-play game just done quicker. By the end of the game, you will have these stats for the players as well as see when and how they happened in the game.<br/><br/>Pitchers: W, L, SV, IP, H, R, ER, K, BB<br/><br/>Hitters: H, 2B, 3B, HR, SB, RBI<br/><br/>After a series or two from a team, multipliers are given to each player to show how many AB he would have based on the number of games his team has played. This can be used to get you batting average leaders, etc... for your league.<br/><br/>Get on the Board with Scoreboard Baseball !<br/><br/>"}, "69752": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic710895.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1989", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "8", "boardgamepublisher": ["Swedish Marketing and Trading AB"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic710895_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice"], "description": "A Game for Two Players<br/><br/>The object of the game is to try to place four counters of the same colour in a row.

Each player has four different sized units that can move different amounts of spaces on a turn (1-4).  Pieces are allowed free movement but may not move through a space they have already occupied that turn or move through another piece.  Pieces can only capture in a straight line of hexes equal to their movement amount and may jump other pieces when capturing.<br/><br/>A key aspect to Portal is the turn structure.  On alternating turns players will make one and two movements.  That is, on turn 1, P1 will move once and P2 twice.  On turn 2, P1 moves twice and P2 moves once and so on.<br/><br/>A portal board consists of three seperate types of &quot;special&quot; hexes.<br/><br/>The middle hex is the Portal.  If you begin your turn with a piece in the portal you may move it to any open open, non-special space on the board and then make your movement(s) for that turn.<br/><br/>The spaces surrounding the portal are weakened.  A piece in those spaces may not make a capturing move, except a &quot;1&quot; may capture into the portal only.<br/><br/>The red corner spaces are protected.  A piece in that space cannot be captured, however, it must be moved out of that space on the player's next turn or it is removed from the board.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player has one or fewer pieces remaining on the board.  Each remaining piece scores points equal to its movement value.

Each player must build a tower taller and more efficiently than the other players. Everyone grabs one of the 6 foundation boards, each with a unique build queue that you are trying to complete during the frantic trading sessions.<br/>After everyone has chosen a foundation board, the game can begin. There are 2 phases repeated throughout the game. The first phase is the Trading/Resource Gathering Phase. Everyone starts with the same deck of 40 Cards, but you will not be using your own cards to build your Tall Tower. Instead the trading/resource gathering is done through an interesting real-time blind trading mechanic. It is a quick thinking and chaotic trading session quite similar to games such as Pit, or Set. Everyone is trading simultaneously, so act fast to get the cards you need, and bluff your opponents into taking the bad cards from your hand.  <br/>The second phase is the Build Phase, where you use the cards you received in the previous phase to build your Tall Tower. Of course it is not as easy as it sounds. You must play the cards in the order you received them, you cannot rearrange your hand. Some cards are good and will help you finish up the next floor of your Tower, or they could be bad and send cracks through a few of the stones you gathered during the Resource Phase.<br/>The Players go through 8 Rounds (of 5 cards each) alternating between these 2 phases, and the one with the Tallest Tower wins. There is lots of chaos during trading, lots of speculation between players as they try to talk each other into taking their cards, and lots of fun as you flip over your resources and see how good you did or how bad you crumbled.<br/><br/>"}, "69794": {"rpgdesigner": ["Dominic Covey"], "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover"], "poll": [], "name": "The Lost City", "rpgartist": ["V.

Showcasing the many Battle Factions of the Untold universe, Untold Battle was created for two players to choose two opposing factions and fight with tooth, bullet, tentacle and spell until only one side remains. But Battle players are not limited - they can use all of the Untold cards to change and make their units unique, or even create their own character, just as if they were going to play the roleplaying game. And Battle doesn't need to be two sided, the rules work for one-on-one, one-on-many, or many-on-many. Untold Battle Rules provide a brutal, bloody, and hard-hitting game that packs a punch!<br/>The Battle Factions<br/><br/>Untold offers limitless possibilities for worlds and adventures. And on every world there are nations, corporations, shadow organizations, alien marauders, and so forth; we collectively call these Factions. We've built all the unique creatures, minions, soldiers, and things that go bump in the night and put them together in Battle Faction packs, so you can pick your favorites or mix and match to do Battle. Untold Battle offers an arena for all the forces of your imagination to duke it out. Now you can pit zombies against soldiers, or tentacled demons against steam punk robots. Or you can help shape the destiny of one of the Untold worlds: will the brave forces of the North American Union overcome the twisted Flux Horrors? Or you can help reshape the face of Europe as the Churl Confederation advances on the new knights of Novus Europa!<br/>The Untold Rules<br/><br/>Untold Battle utilizes Untold Minion Cards because they are quick to use. Minions are one card, instead of a number of cards, that represent a single character, and that is important when your Battle has a large number of forces. And Minions still offer the limitless customization of Untold Powers through Swapping.<br/><br/>Once players choose their Factions and/or characters, Battle is as simple as lining up the cards on the table across from each other and taking turns between their minions. Battle utilizes Untold's simple and quick combat mechanics (see our Online Primer for more, or just refer to back of the handy insert that comes with every Battle Faction pack), and all the rules you need for the minions are on the cards!<br/><br/>"}, "69806": {"rpgartist": ["Anthony Cournoyer"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Innocent", "rpgdesigner": ["Christopher A.

One player takes the role of the Colonial Marines, and his opponent assumes control of the hordes of deadly xenomorphs.<br/><br/>At their disposal, the Colonial Marines - very tough hombres - have a roster of high-tech, state-of-the-art weaponry.<br/><br/>The Alien player's objective is to eliminate all the Marines, before they escape the planet and &quot;Nuke the entire site from orbit.&quot;<br/><br/>The game has an asymmetrical design, with both decks featuring different cards and abilities.

Gameplay is quick and bloodthirsty with Marines butchered frequently, and aliens destroyed by the well-placed use of cards.<br/><br/>Numerous tricky decisions must be made throughout. For instance, the Colonial Marine player could choose to deploy the Powerloader during the Reactor Chamber battle, but the resources that this would require make it a very risky, but rewarding, play. Similarly, the Alien player can deploy the Alien Queen at any time during the conflict - she's free to play aboard the Sulaco, but hugely expensive if used during the APC Withdrawal, for instance.<br/><br/>Primarily a combat-driven card game, each player must manage his deck of cards effectively to win.

Before beginning play, carefully remove the counter pages and punch out the perforated counters.<br/><br/>The counters come in two types: characters and monsters. Character counters provide a blank space at the bottom for the character's name. For game purposes, the arrow in the top left corner indicates the direction that character is facing. Monster counters have a small arrow in the top left corner indicating direction, as well as a blank square at the bottom right, allowing the GM to assign numbers to multiple monsters of the same type. For example, the party may encounter four bugbears, which would be numbered 1 to 4. The GM can then keep track of the individual hit points and actions according to which particular bugbear is involved in the resulting combat.<br/><br/>Monster counters are not labled with monster type, as many characters may encounter creatures for the first time and out-of-character knowledge of the monster may prove to be an unfair advantage. The GM should use this to his or her advantage. For instance, rather than saying, &quot;You encounter four bugbears,&quot; the GM might say, &quot;You encounter four large goblinoids,&quot; then place the appropriate counters on your battle grid for the players to see the picture.<br/><br/>When you play with a Fiery Dragon adventure, you bring more to the table!<br/><br/>"}, "69865": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Tom Homer"], "poll": [], "name": "Loop", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Route/Network Building"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic711020_t.jpg", "average": "5.9", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["The Game Crafter, LLC"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic711020.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Card Game"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Loop is a semi-cooperative abstract strategy game for up to six players or teams.<br/><br/>Play involves laying cards to build colored loops, with longer loops worth more points at the end of the game.

Additionally, the game keeps two digital clocks: one depicting the time in the present-day era and another for whichever era Eike time-travels to. The amount of time Eike spends in the different eras also passes in the present-day one. The cut-scenes and dialogue takes up varying amounts of in-game time. When the clock arrives at the time of Eike's death, the chapter restarts; however, if Eike is not in his time period at the time of his death, the game ends.<br/><br/>The color tone varies depending on which era Eike time-travels to.

(RL!) is the seventh volume of Red Sash Games' Lace Wars series, and opens a new subject, the Nine Years War, sometimes called the War of the League of Augsburg, Toward the end of the 17th Century, at a time when Europe is consumed by war, the powerful Catholic dynasty of the Habsburgs, and the Pope, have formed an unnatural league with the Protestant states of northern Germany, and with the Prince of Orange, de facto ruler of the Netherlands, against their coreligionists, the French. They oppose the overweening ambitions of the Sun King, Louis XIV. To augment the strength of the League, William, Prince of Orange, has taken advantage of popular dissatisfaction with his father-in-law, King James II, to engineer an armed coup and take over the government of England. This will help fill the coffers of the League and ensure that England does not ally with France.<br/><br/>But the English throne brings with it the governance of Scotland and of Ireland. While some in these countries welcome the Glorious Revolution, many do not. Especially is this so in Ireland, where a small Protestant minority lords it over a helot population of Irish and Anglo-Irish Catholics - an Ascendancy secured only a generation before by the swords of Oliver Cromwell's men and still maintained by force of arms and by force of English Law. In the last years of King James' rule, his Deputy, Richard Talbot, Earl of Tyrconnel, has worked hard to overturn this Cromwellian Settlement, stuffing the Administration and the Army with Catholics. The Protestants are afraid.<br/><br/>King James, abandoned by many that he trusted, including his own family, suffers a nervous breakdown and leaves England for France, determined to devote the rest of his life to religious pursuits. But his cousin, King Louis, points to Ireland as a place where a fallen monarch may retrieve his fortunes. Tyrconnel and the new Irish Army, and a picked brigade of veteran French, will enable James to drive his son-in-law from the British Isles - and incidentally, force Dutch Billy to withdraw much of his army from the Low Countries, where the French hope to gain much in the next few campaigns.

It was released on September 11, 2006. Part of the Lego Star Wars series, it is based on the Star Wars science fiction media franchise and Lego Group's Star Wars-themed toy line. It follows the events of the Star Wars films A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The game allows players to assume the roles of over 50 Lego versions of characters from the film series; customized characters can also be created. Camera movement was improved from its predecessor - Lego Star Wars: The Video Game - and the concept of &quot;vehicle levels&quot; was explored more thoroughly. Lego Star Wars II was highly anticipated because of its predecessor's success, and was revealed at American International Toy Fair 2006. Promotions for the game were set up at chain stores across the United States.<br/><br/>Lego Star Wars II was critically and commercially successful; it has sold over 8.2 million copies worldwide as of May 2009. Critics praised the game for its comedic and &quot;adorable&quot; portrayal of the film series and for their preference of the original trilogy to the prequel trilogy. However, the game's low difficulty, and its Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS versions in general, were received more poorly.

Also setting itself apart from the NES-era games was the in-game presentation, which is more akin to the realistic &quot;TV style&quot; presentation of modern football games like the Madden series. After a big offensive play, or a turnover or sack on defense, a box would appear on screen with a small grayscale picture of the player involved alongside his current statistics for the game.<br/><br/>The series' shift towards greater realism is also reflected in the game's season mode.

The winner is the first to finish their hand.<br/><br/>The suits are related to Charlie Chaplin's general image; Canes, Shoes (untied), Neckties, and Hats.<br/><br/>This game is interesting because the card backs are unique to each card.

Originally planned for the PlayStation, Ico took approximately four years to develop. The team employed a &quot;subtracting design&quot; approach to reduce elements of gameplay that interfered with the game's setting and story in order to create a high level of immersion.<br/><br/>The titular protagonist is a young boy, born with horns his village considers him a bad omen. Warriors lock Ico away in an abandoned fortress and during his explorations Ico encounters Yorda, the daughter of the castle's Queen. Ico seeks to escape the castle with Yorda, keeping her safe from the shadow-like creatures that attempt to draw her back. Throughout the game the player controls Ico as he explores the castle, solves puzzles, and assists the less-agile Yorda across obstacles.<br/><br/>Ico introduced several design and technical elements, including a story told with minimal dialog, bloom lighting and key frame animation, that have influenced subsequent games. Though not a commercial success it was critically acclaimed for its art and story elements and received several awards including &quot;Game of the Year&quot; nominations and three Game Developers Choice Awards. Ico is listed on several overall top game lists, and is often considered a form of art. The game was reprinted in Europe in 2006 in conjunction with the release of Shadow of the Colossus, the spiritual successor to Ico.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Ico,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "69532": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic882551.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Christoph Cantzler"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": ["Public Solution GmbH"], "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic882551_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Electronic", "Memory", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Real-time"], "description": "Translated from the publisher's site:<br/><br/>Nothing beats the fresh Crab Burgers from Mr Krabs' Krusty Krab!.

It combines the fast-moving combat of Greek hand-to-hand warfare with the incredible mythology of Homer.<br/><br/>The ancient Greeks are well known as the most advanced of philosophers. From the abstract to the concrete, they theorized, postulated, and experimented. From algebra to calculus, from creation to ethics, they were the best of thinkers. And yet, in this environment of intellectual enlightenment, they worshiped deities as diverse as they were complex.<br/><br/>Imagine a young Greek warrior leaving home for adventure, fame, and fortune, seeking a place of honor among heroes such as Achilles, Heracles, and Agammemnon. Could he survive and reach his goal, or would he die in the trying? Only his skill, courage, luck, and the favor of the gods will lead to success.<br/><br/>Odysseus uses a role-playing format to simulate the epic adventure of mythic Greece. The rules are composed of six sections, each describing an aspect of play, mechanics, or genre in the game, such as combat between individuals and armies, sieges, and naval engagements, as well as the people, cultures, gods, and monsters of the Hellenic world. Together they form the backbone of a role-playing game that attempts to be &quot;realistic&quot; in nature, while remaining enjoyable to all the players.<br/><br/>May the gods favor your conquest!<br/><br/>"}, "69571": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jesse Benner", "James Jacobs", "Kevin Kulp (II)", "Robin D.

On a turn, a player has four action points available, with which he can play cards from his hand (which cost 0-4 points) or advance his squirrel down the trees on his trail, with each space costing a point. At the end of a player's turn, he can discard any number of cards he wants, then refill his hand to five cards.<br/><br/>Cards can either help you or attack opponents. Use a sacred tree to provide a safe haven that others can't destroy, and place the Divine Nut on your path, a special treat that can be claimed only after taking a nut from the stash. Take chainsaws and flamethrowers to opponents' trees, or send a bullzoer up their trail to demolish trees one by one over several turns.

Game board (15 x 15 squares)<br/>. 36 dice x number of players (72 for 2 player, 108 for 3 player, 144 for 4 players) &ndash; each player should have a different colour of dice<br/>. These Rules<br/>. Diagonal Arrow Tiles x 30 (Optional)<br/><br/>Set Up<br/>. - If using arrow tiles, place them 3 at a time (alternating who puts them down) on the board wherever you like.<br/>. - Players roll their dice 6 at a time and place them on their side of the board. Alternate putting dice on the board. You can place them within the five rows closest to them on the board (exactly where is generally irrelevant, but can ultimately be used as some sort of strategy depending on how you put them down). Keep doing this until each player has at least 30 dice on the board.<br/>.... - You may opt to hold 6 dice in reserve so you can place them in game at a later time.<br/>.... - When you play these reserves you can put any number of them on the board at a time, so long as they are on your own side of the board. Remember to roll them first to determine which side is facing up.<br/>. - Starting a die on the board so that it pincers an opponent&rsquo;s die does not count as a capture.<br/>. - Designate starting player.<br/><br/>Arrow Tiles<br/>. Landing on an arrow tile grants you an additional direction to move in - always a diagonal. If the arrow points up and to the left, then you may move up, down, left, right, or up-left.<br/><br/>Rules for Play<br/>. - Players alternate moving one die each turn.<br/>. - If you drop one of your dice on another one of your dice, the die at the bottom is removed and can be replayed on a later turn with a different number on its face.<br/>. - Any dice captured by your opponent are removed from the game. You don&rsquo;t get them back during this game.<br/>. - A die can jump in any of the four directions provided they a) stay on the board, and b) don&rsquo;t land on an enemy die with a number different to the die you are moving. You can drop any of your dice on top of any of your own dice, provided they are in range.<br/>. - You can only move your pieces in a straight line.<br/>. - If you jump your dice between two enemy dice, you don&rsquo;t lose that die. The opponent must manoeuvre into a position where they jump beside you.<br/><br/>Reinforcements<br/>You can play any number of reinforcements in your home zone (the first five lines on your side of the board) on your turn instead of moving one of your dice.<br/>If you place a reinforcement next to an opponent&rsquo;s die that already has one of your dice on an opposing side, it does not count as a capture.<br/><br/>Buffer<br/>One line of squares running from corner to corner of the board should act as a buffer if you intend to have more than 2 people playing a game. I.e. during initial deployment, you cannot place one of your own dice next to an opponent&rsquo;s dice.<br/><br/>Dice Rules<br/>. - Number 1 Dice: can move one square, capture enemy Number 1 Dice by jumping on them, or can push a friendly die into reserve by jumping on it.<br/>. - Number 2 Dice: can move 2 squares, capture enemy Number 2 Dice by jumping on them, or can push a friendly die into reserve by jumping on it.<br/>. - Number 3 Dice: can move 3 squares, capture enemy Number 3 Dice by jumping on them, or can push a friendly die into reserve by jumping on it.<br/>. - Number 4 Dice: can move 4 squares, capture enemy Number 4 Dice by jumping on them, or can push a friendly die into reserve by jumping on it.<br/>. - Number 5 Dice: can move 5 squares, capture enemy Number 5 Dice by jumping on them, or can push a friendly die into reserve by jumping on it.<br/>. - Number 6 Dice: can move 6 squares, capture enemy Number 6 Dice by jumping on them, or can push a friendly die into reserve by jumping on it.<br/>- Capture: Jumping on an enemy die with the same number on its face. Moving your dice into position so that there is one of your dice on either side (left and right or front and back) of a die with any number on its face.<br/><br/>Board Shape<br/>It was recently brought to my attention that the game can be played on grids that aren't necessarily square. To play on a triangular board, your pieces can move normally in all 6 directions, thus rendering the need for the arrow toils null.<br/><br/>Winning<br/>. Players who have less than 6 dice left on the board (with no reserves) lose. A player may concede defeat any time after they are reduced to ten dice less than their opponent (e.g. if they have 15 dice and their opponent has 25 dice, they can concede defeat).<br/><br/>"}, "69624": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Wally Davis"], "poll": [], "name": "Crime Crushers", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1986", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Copouts Ink"], "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Humor"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From the side of the box:<br/><br/>&quot;... a game of criminal pursuit, is a fast-paced, simulated street cop role-playing game that looks at the humorous side of law enforcement as it relates to the patrol division ...&quot;<br/><br/>Players take turns rolling the dice and moving about the game board.
