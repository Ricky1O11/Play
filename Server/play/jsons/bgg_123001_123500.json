Some of these consume Spirit Points, which slowly regenerate each turn. The game is divided into stages. Between each stage, the player is able to visit a shop and prepare his units before starting the next stage. Unlike most RPGs, characters do not gain levels for directly defeating opponents. Instead, completion of a map will reward the players with a number of level ups, which they can then distribute among their units as they wish.<br/><br/>As a crossover game, Namco Super Wars includes characters from a number of previous Namco games.

The player begins with a hand of four cards, drawing more as the duel proceeds. The battle system is similar to Yu-Gi-Oh! in that the three types of cards perform in a rock, paper, and scissors pattern. Attack cards are played against each other to compare values with the loser being discarded and deducting HP, an attack card played against a defense nullifies each other (except in the case of a counter), and two block cards cancel each other out. There is also a minor system of air juggling, which can be quite damaging given the correct order of cards.<br/><br/>Tekken Card Challenge also provides the player with a variety of game modes.

It was later ported to Nintendo's Game Boy Advance for international releases in North America and Europe two years later.<br/><br/>The game features characters and Digimon that were included in the first three seasons of the animated series of the same name in a somewhat simplistic fighting scenario, and also has slightly arranged samples of the show's soundtrack.<br/><br/>The Digital World, a computer-generated subspace that exists between all forms of digital devices, and home of the creatures known as &quot;Digimon&quot; is under attack by a malevolent and powerful force known as Millenniummon, who seeks to corrupt all the data present in the world and modify it to his own designs. In response, several Digimon and their human companions have set out to stop Millenniummon and his minions before any irreparable harm can be done. This is accomplished in a very round-about and a-typical way to the fighting videogame genre, by finding and defeating as many opponents as possible on the way.<br/><br/>While structured very similarly to a conventional fighting game, Digimon Battle Spirit is much more like a barebones representation of the genre, mostly due to the limitations of the handhelds it was released on. Each character only has a handful of special attacks they can perform, with the two action buttons, A and B, allowing them to jump or attack respectively.<br/><br/>Each match is won by collecting small blue spheres called &quot;D-Spirits&quot;. These are obtained by hitting your opponent, which causes a few of them to fly from their body and scatter across the battlefield. Different attacks can produce more spheres to fly out, and the player who has collected the most by the time the round ends wins. Each character can also digivolve into their most powerful or &quot;Ultimate&quot; (Mega) form by touching a flying Digimon named Calumon that appears every so often in each stage. This form grants them different, more powerful attacks for a limited time.<br/><br/>As the player advances through each stage, they will occasionally have to battle a character named Impmon. Winning or losing this encounter has no bearing on the actual game progression itself, and only serves to award more points. In the final stage, the Digimon must face off against Millenniummon himself.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Digimon Tamers: Battle Spirit&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "123009": {"poll": [], "name": "Digimon Tamers: Battle Spirit Ver. 1.5", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["JP WonderSwan Color edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Anime"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Bandai (\u30d0\u30f3\u30c0\u30a4)"], "videogamefranchise": ["Digimon"], "videogameplatform": ["WonderSwan Color"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Bandai (\u30d0\u30f3\u30c0\u30a4)"], "description": "Digimon Tamers: Battle Spirit Ver. 1.5 was released exclusively in Japan for the WonderSwan Color handheld console. It expands on Digimon Tamers: Battle Spirit (released in the United States and Europe as Digimon Battle Spirit) and contains many new features and characters.

In addition, Patamon and Gatomon were added, with Seraphimon and Ophanimon as their evolutions, respectively.<br/><br/>In addition, there were two unlockable Digimon; An Extra Guilmon (who is unlocked by obtaining the &quot;ultimate*&quot; level tag in single player mode) who, like the Extra Agumon that could evolve into Omnimon, evolved into Gallantmon Crimson Mode, and the returning Impmon (who is unlocked by obtaining the &quot;champion*&quot; level tag in single player mode), with Beelzemon Blast Mode as a new evolution .<br/><br/>Three new levels were added in Digimon Tamers: Battle Spirit Ver. 1.5.:<br/><br/>A train level, possibly a Locomon, was included as Patamon's level. The Train had two vents on either side of the level which worked similar to the trampoline in Terriermon's level. During the match, the train passes through a modern, unnamed town. DemiDevimon are constantly flying above the fighters.<br/><br/>A waterfall level was included as Gatomon's level. The Digimon fight beside and behind the waterfall, with bushes here and there on the sides. Makuramon can occasionally be seen in the bushes, and Gotsumon occasionally roll down the mountain. This is the only vertical level in the Digimon: Battle Spirit series.<br/><br/>Instead of randomly interrupting a fight, Impmon received his own stage, which appears to be loosely based on the net from the Second Digimon Movie. Television screens of Impmon line both sides of the level, and the entire stage has an odd feel to it. Interestingly, the level is vertically symmetrical; you can see a floor above you when you're on the highest platform. The suction effect, which draws loose data to Impmon, is automatically on.

The offense has 9 spots/plays to place their pawn.  The defense has 11 pawns with 16 spots to try and stop the play of the offense.  When the huddleboard is removed each team can see the result of the play. At each spot on the board a result of the play is posted as whether its a gain, loss, turnover, TD, or incomplete. After each play, you record the information on the yardage/down marker. Like football, the offensive player must make 10 yards in 4 downs to continue or the the board is turned around to switch positions.  The game can be played for 30 or 60 minutes depending on your preference. Note: All plays are based on national averages. There is no advantage to either team.

Herein lie seven dragon lairs and the serpents that inhabit them, following in the footsteps of the Seven Strongholds, Seven Cities, and Sacred Ground sourcebooks. Seven Serpents includes:<br/><br/>- The Blue Rat: A blue wyrmling has taken up residence in the palatial home of a djinni. The creature has become a nuisance by leaving droppings all over the place and attacking servants. Despite his best efforts, the djinni has been unable to catch it, so he needs some exterminators . . .<br/>- The Dragon Moot: Every few centuries, representatives from each of the dragon breeds gather at a fallen tree nearly four miles in length. Here their leaders put aside their conflicts and discuss larger matters at hand. The current sheriff is a young half-gold/half-green dragon named Kusig who has no idea how to keep the peace.<br/>- Cliffside: A juvenile copper dragon's lair is built into the side of a cliff, and is protected with traps and puzzles to ensure that those who seek him out deserve his help. Visitors who are unable to fly must rely on ropes and other climbing gear.<br/>- The Last Dragon Rider: The silver dragons of Talisantha Hall once served as warrior-mounts for the knights who dwelt there. Now the last of their number wanders its desolate halls, searching for the cure to the vampirism that infects him and his lady-love.<br/>- Tithe Bend: Frail and undersized from birth, the black dragon Dunstitz realised that the hoard he craved would require the very essence of dragon cunning and guile to attain. So, posing as a river spirit, he collects the tithe that sailors throw over the sides of their ships.<br/>- Smoke on the Water: In a mining camp dedicated to extracting a rare ore called bog silver, the blazing hot body of a comatose red dragon generates the steam used to power drills, boring devices, water pumps, and smelters. The adamantine spike shoved through the gargantuan dragon's head is to key to its imprisonment.<br/>- The Darkness of Space: A great gold wyrm has built her lair in the darkness of space. She survives through a combination of spells and magic items, and is served by an army of constructs. The lair houses a powerful artifact that keeps a terrible evil at bay, and the dragon does not take kindly to intruders.<br/><br/>"}, "123032": {"poll": [], "name": "F1 World Grand Prix", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Dreamcast edition", "North American Nintendo 64 edition", "North American PlayStation edition", "North American Windows edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1633710.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Driving"], "usersrated": "3", "videogamedeveloper": ["Paradigm Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo 64", "PlayStation", "Sega Dreamcast", "Windows"], "average": "5.83333", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["EIDOS Interactive", "Video System"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1633710_t.jpg", "description": "F-1 World Grand Prix is a Formula One racing game/sim first released in 1998 for the Nintendo 64 game console and to later platforms including Dreamcast, Game Boy Color, PC and PlayStation.

The final mode allowed 2 players to compete in a single, split-screen race.<br/><br/>F-1 World Grand Prix offered a fairly realistic experience for its time. Prior to races, allowed for the fine-tuning of the player's car; including tyre tread, amount of fuel and wing angle. The cars themselves followed realistic simulated physics and were at risk of damage and wear like their real-life counterparts. Weather (and its effects) was also simulated. Visually, the game offered the same trademark appearance of live F1 coverage, and aimed to have a photo-realistic appeal.<br/><br/>F-1 World Grand Prix was highly acclaimed by most critics, more so than its sequel F-1 World Grand Prix II, which many felt lacked a sufficient number of improvements over the original.<br/><br/>Due to copyright issues, WilliamsF1 driver Jacques Villeneuve is not featured in the game and in his place is a silhouette of his body and his name is simply Driver Williams.

The spinner itself is used to determine the 'colour' of the question you have to face.<br/><br/>The questions are intended for children to answer, not adults.<br/><br/>"}, "123083": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Bob Valvano"], "poll": [], "name": "He Shoots...He Scores!", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "1993", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Ice Hockey"], "average": "3", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Valgames"], "boardgameversion": ["Valgames First Publication"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Sports"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Statistical ice hockey game.

Play takes place on a board which represents a real city or historic location, and small chips are placed on building squares (buildings can be occupied, blockaded or vandalized). The Radical player chooses randomly from a small deck of objective cards and both players choose their tactics for the game. Victory is achieved by the Radical player if they complete their objectives in an allotted number of rounds. The Police player only gets a small piece of flavor text as a hint to the objectives of the radical player, and their objective is to keep the radical player from gaining victory points and completing their goals.

The rules are designed to be easy to learn, for speed of play (particularly with play-by-post style games), and to focus on character growth rather than looting and killing.  The game is written for play in the style of Sword and Sorcery. These adventures focus mainly on personal battles rather than world-endangering matters. The game is geared toward traditional medieval fantasy.<br/><br/>Dichotomy is designed for a group of about 4-6 players. One participant serves as the Game Master or &quot;GM&quot;; the other participants are referred to as &quot;players&quot;. The GM has a special role in that the GM is responsible for establishing scenes, acting as a referee, and playing the roles of the minor characters in the game. Each player is responsible for creating a character with a personality and motives. The player decides how their character acts or reacts to various scenes described by the GM.  The characters created by the players are called Player Characters (PCs), while the characters or monsters created by the GM are called Non-Player Characters (NPCs).<br/><br/>The game is played with the characters experiencing a series of adventures which may be pre-planned by the GM or arise organically out of the characters Motives.  The GM determines the pacing of adventures, depending on the scope of the game that the GM and players wish to participate in.  A game might last for a one-shot session, it could last for 10 sessions over a few weeks, or it could be an ongoing epic lasting a year or more.<br/><br/>"}, "123102": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Claude E.

There is nothing like a memorable magical weapon to help define a character throughout a campaign, just think about your favorite fictional heroes of fantasy and the weapons that they carry!<br/><br/>It is certainly possible to purchase a magical warhammer such as the dwarven thrower or a magical longsword like the nine lives stealer, but most weapons are not represented at all. For example, where are the magical falchions, flails, kukris, morningstars, spears, hand crossbows and whips? Sure, a creative player can take a look at the special abilities and come up with a concept of his own, but it will be a very limited concept, limited to the twenty-nine special abilities of the core rulebook. The Advanced Player's Guide makes this selection slightly bigger, yet, most weapons are still not represented among the specific magical weapons selection.<br/><br/>This series of short pdfs hope to bring new weapons and concepts to your game!<br/><br/>These are the 15 specific weapons from Volume 4:<br/>- Assassin's Mercy (kama)<br/>- Backwatching Boar Spear (boar spear)<br/>- Blade of Glories Past (intelligent falcata)<br/>- Boulder Thrower (sling)<br/>- Earthsplitter (gnome hooked hammer)<br/>- Earthwrack (warhammer)<br/>- Eldritch Piercer (repeating light crossbow)<br/>- Impact Storm (lucerne hammer)<br/>- Nature's Vengeance (quarterstaff)<br/>- Pit Bola (bola)<br/>- Rainbow Boomerang (boomerang)<br/>- Seeker (elven curve blade)<br/>- Spinning Peace (nunchaku)<br/>- Storm Hammer (meteor hammer)<br/>- Spiderwhip (whip)<br/>- Talon of Shadow Rending (flying talon)<br/><br/>Yes, there are 16 weapons and not 15 as announced!

Lovecraft stories. They are set in Boston, Providence, the British Isles, continental Europe and the Middle East. None of the scenarios need to be played at set dates or in a set order, but they could be run in the order presented to form a loose campaign using optional links between scenarios to draw investigators from one to the other.<br/><br/>Alternatively, the scenarios may be used to supplement classic Call of Cthulhu campaigns such as The Shadows of Yog-Sothoth and The Fungi from Yuggoth, the latter currently in print as The Day of the Beast, both of which suggest their component scenarios should be interspersed with others.<br/><br/>The first scenario in this book, &ldquo;The Art of Madness&rdquo; follows on from the events of the Lovecraft tale &ldquo;Pickman&rsquo;s Model&rdquo;. Artist of the macabre, Richard Upton Pickman, is now a ghoul living a subterranean netherworld beneath Boston creating a new school of art. There are several ways that player characters might be drawn into investigating his macabre activities and, while dangerous, Pickman&rsquo;s intent is not particularly lethal. The difficulty for investigators will be to resolve the situation without becoming compromised.<br/><br/>While in New England, the investigators discover &ldquo;The Crystal of Chaos&rdquo;, a retelling of the events of Lovecraft&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Haunter of the Dark&rdquo;. Hired by professors of Miskatonic University, the investigator seek out a fabled crystal with origins in Ancient Egypt, but they soon find a far greater evil lurks in an abandoned church in Providence. This scenario originally appeared in Different Worlds issue 34, May/June 1984, and has been expanded and revised in this publication.<br/><br/>&ldquo;The Return of the Hound&rdquo; draws investigators an auction in Yorkshire, in England, where a rare edition of the Necronomicon is going to be sold. The previous owners, the decadent occultists from Lovecraft&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Hound&rdquo;, are dead, as that tale recounts, but what they unearthed in &lsquo;a Holland churchyard&rsquo; has grown strong, and has schemes of its own to fulfill. The amount of danger the investigators face is dependent on how determined they are not to let this Necronomicon fall into the wrong hands.<br/><br/>&ldquo;The Jermyn Horror&rdquo; takes place in Britain, beginning in London and then moving to Huntingdon with the investigators seeking a rare edition of Regnum Congo, reputedly to be found in the crumbling estate of the deceased Jermyn family as described in Lovecraft&rsquo;s &ldquo;Arthur Jermyn&rdquo;. The search is imperiled by a creature that a Jermyn brought back from the Congo some three hundred years ago that haunts the mansion seeking a human vessel for its escape.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Nameless City, Nameless Terrors&rdquo; concludes this collection with an expedition into the heart of Arabia&rsquo;s Empty Quarter in search of Irem as described in Lovecraft&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Nameless City&rdquo;. This scenario requires investigators to risk their bodies and their minds as, in the midst of the desolate ruins of Irem, the investigators learn something of the nature of the Great Old Ones, and perhaps forestall the rising of Cthulhu from his watery grave.<br/><br/>"}, "123160": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1793962.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Robert Burke"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Fra Angelico", "Hans Baldung", "Jean Benner", "Richard Bergh", "William Blake", "Arnold B\u00f6cklin", "Hieronymus Bosch", "William Bouguereau", "Limbourg Brothers", "Ford Madox Brown", "Pieter Bruegel the Elder", "Miguel Cabrera", "Caravaggio", "Annibale Carracci", "Claudio Coello", "Juan Correa", "Giovanni Battista Salvi da Sassoferrato", "Pietro de Cortona", "Evelyn De Morgan", "Alonso Miguel de Tovar", "Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n", "Francesco del Cossa", "Taddeo di Bartolo", "Gustave Dor\u00e9", "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "Albert Gustaf Aristides Edelfelt", "Luis Ricardo Falero", "Luis Francisco", "Henry Fuseli", "Cornelis Galle, the Elder", "Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard", "Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me", "John William Godward", "Hans Holbein, the Younger", "William Holman Hunt", "Ernst Josephson", "Svilen Kostadinov", "Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer", "Carl Larsson", "Frans Luycx", "Andrea Mantegna", "Niklaus Manuel", "Quentin Matsys", "Hans Memling", "Fran\u00e7ois-Guillaume M\u00e9nageot", "Michelangelo", "Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo", "Michael Pacher", "Vasily Grigorevich Perov", "Pietro Perugino", "Nicolas Poussin", "James Powell (II)", "Raphael", "Guido Reni", "Ilya Repin", "Christian Reuter", "Dante Gabriel Rossetti", "Sir Peter Paul Rubens", "Martin Schongauer", "Joel Dorman Steele", "Esther Baker Steele", "Titian", "Michiel Van Coxie", "Rembrandt van Rijn", "Viktor Vasnetsov", "Johannes Vermeer", "George F.

The action centers around Fallos, mysterious creatures that resemble humans in some ways, and their ability to balance on a playing field of 3-D cubes.<br/><br/>Your role begins with creating a pair of Fallos inside your Wii Remote controller by shaking it up and down. Next, you&rsquo;re responsible for determining suitable destinations for them to land and then flinging the Fallos from your Wii Remote to the selected cube with a swinging motion. After that, the Fallos are on their own. If your placement is sound, the Fallos will remain stable and you&rsquo;ll clear the stage after tossing a required number onto the cubes. But if the weight or locations of Fallos causes the cubes to tilt and sway too much, the Fallos will lose their balance and fall off. Adding to the challenge, you&rsquo;ll find that some cubes have different properties, making tosses tricky and further threatening the stability of the Fallos.

Originally owned by James T. Blackwood in 1963, the house is passed to Christopher Milton after Mr. Blackwood is accused of murdering his wife. A couple of days later, Mr. Blackwood dies of a sudden heart attack though some in the town rumor he might have committed suicide. The police decide to close the case seeing there is no further evidence left. Shortly after acquiring the house, Milton inexplicably disappears in 1970 leaving no visible trace. The player assumes the role of the house's next inhabitant, Michael Arthate, an author seeking seclusion to work on his next book. He moves in only to find that the house still echoes its horrible past quite literally as scratches are heard all around, particularly in the basement and fireplaces, and soon becomes more interested in researching the house's history than his writing.<br/><br/>Scratches uses a first person perspective to navigate around the house. Using only a mouse, the player can access various rooms and other places in order to solve the mystery of both Blackwood and Milton's disappearances.

It is a hearty publication and not for nitpickers or miseries. There are some good gags in it, but it also plays well and enables players to conduct a very big battle in a reasonable period of time, leaving them more time to chat about the highs and lows and what ifs...&quot;<br/><br/>Pike &amp; Shotte closes the gap that Warlord Games left between the &quot;Hail Caesar&quot; and the &quot;Black Powder&quot; rulebooks. Using the hallmark Warlord Games orders system (a player must state what his units are about to do, then make a leadership roll dice to check the efficiency with whom of the order given is received), with a 3-phases turn modality that clearly brings the Rick Priestley firm, the game is very smooth, fast and less detailed and mechanic than its stronger competitor, the Field of Glory Renaissance system.<br/><br/>"}, "123224": {"rpgdesigner": ["Joseph Browning"], "rpg": ["Old School Reference and Index Compilation (OSRIC)"], "poll": [], "name": "Down the Shadowvein", "rpgartist": ["Joseph Browning", "William McAusland", "Stefan Poag", "Claudio Pozas"], "rpgproducer": ["Joseph Browning", "Suzi Yee"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1402990.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Softcover Version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Expeditious Retreat Press"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["AA - Advanced Adventures"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1402990_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>Down the Shadowvein is an OSRIC(tm) module designed for 6-10 adventures of levels 3-5.

Life Grids consist of four different tracks, or suits: Relationships, Wealth, Knowledge, and Experience. Each player must build the best Life Grid possible by balancing the development of all four suits with the hope of playing the Legend card and multiplying their points. Of course, the crowning achievement for any suit is for the player to achieve knighthood in one of their suits by playing all four cards in one suit without having any Hard Knocks.<br/><br/>"}, "123258": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Bring Out Your Gods", "rpgdesigner": ["Dylan Parker"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1282057.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Bring Out Your Gods"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["History (Ancient)", "Mythology / Folklore"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1282057_t.jpg", "description": "From the Introduction:<br/>Introduction<br/>Bring Out Your Gods is an RPG set in the ancient world, spanning<br/>from ancient Greece to Egypt.

This included a coalition of Russia, Prussia and Austria committed to defeat France and its allies, forging a domination of Europe that would lead to the Nationalism of Germany. While historians have drawn a myriad of contrary opinions about who were the good guys and bad guys, the battle encircles the city of Leipzig with 500,000 man armies facing each other.<br/><br/>The sheer size of this conflict can truly test a designer&rsquo;s skill when representing it at a battalion level. However, Leipzig is actually a series of smaller battles fought west, east, south and north of Leipzig as the Coalition armies concentrically move toward the City. La Bataille de M&ouml;ckern 1813 is the battle north of Leipzig.<br/><br/>M&ouml;ckern focuses on the raging struggle for this northern town which guards the passable roads to Leipzig moving south. As such, Napoleon entrusted the defense to Marshal Marmont and his VI Corps. In addition to veteran troops, Marmont has conscripts and sailors recently removed from the ports. Supporting Marmont is the III Cavalry Corps of de Casanova.<br/><br/>Coming down on this position is the Coalition&rsquo;s Army of Silesia commanded by Marshal von Bl&uuml;cher. This army has a Prussian Corps, a Russian Corps and a Russian Cavalry Corps. The Prussians are fresh from several victories including holding Berlin. The Russians are somewhat smaller units given their casualties in 1812. However the Russians have a strong contingent of Cossacks and line cavalry.<br/><br/>The player will note immediately the differences in the Coalition formations and how each must be managed to achieve success. The French, Prussians and Russians Corps all operate a little differently injecting some real historical significance to the simulation and advancing the player&rsquo;s skills as Corps Commanders.<br/>Marmont held and lost the town of M&ouml;ckern several times in this battle while the cavalry of Casanova held back the Russians. The fighting was intense, and continued into the dusk and evening hours.<br/><br/>Each 20 minute turn starts with a Command Phase for both sides followed by the French Player sequence and then by the Prussian Player sequence. The sequence includes movement, cavalry charges, fire and melee. During each, morale plays a decisive role. This is a great one player on one player game but will also accommodate two players on a side also.<br/><br/>The original rules have been updated but not expanded to any extent. The original designers of the La Bataille Series believe the Premier Rules facilitate / expedite the most accurate and competitive play. The new Premier Rules are an update of the original rules but make it easier to find specific topics and includes some user requested rules such as command control.<br/><br/>New rules for the players to consider are the effects of Elite Units, Landwehr skirmishing, Russian Dragoon&rsquo;s abilities, improved towns, dusk combat, the loyalties of certain units, command structures and plundering. Besides the historical battle, four scenarios are included. These provide for a cavalry on cavalry only battle, inspired attacks by von Bluecher and the ability to jump into combat for the struggle of Moeckern itself. This scenario will end whenever a player reaches a threshold casualties and disintegration of order.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.53571", "name": "La Bataille de M\u00f6ckern 1813", "playingtime": "420", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "15", "usersrated": "7", "boardgamefamily": ["La Bataille series"]}, "123276": {"poll": [], "name": "Super Stardust Delta", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["PlayStation Vita Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1282777.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Stardust"], "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "8", "videogamedeveloper": ["Housemarque"], "videogamegenre": ["Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation Vita"], "average": "7.5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sony Online Entertainment"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1282777_t.jpg", "description": "Using PlayStation Vita's dual analog sticks, players control a starship orbiting a planet, and the orbit itself is the playfield, filled with asteroids &amp; enemies.

The different game modes are &quot;Arcade&quot;, &quot;Planets&quot;, &quot;Endless&quot;, &quot;Bomber&quot;, &quot;Impact&quot;, &quot;Twin-Gun&quot;, &quot;Crush!&quot;, &quot;Disc Slide&quot;, &quot;Orbit Bomber&quot;, &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, and &quot;Trucker&quot;. The main game modes have three difficulty levels to choose from; &quot;Casual&quot;, &quot;Normal&quot;, or &quot;Hardcore&quot;.<br/><br/>Even more, many of the game modes let players choose whether to play the game with the &quot;Delta&quot; or &quot;Pure&quot; control configuration. &quot;Delta&quot; configuration features all the bells and whistles, with players using the touchscreen, motion controls, as well as button controls to play the game, enabling the Black Hole and Missile Strike smart bombs, as well as the speed boost getting the slo-mo feature. &quot;Pure&quot; configuration features simple button controls only, doing away with the Black Hole, Missile Strike and the speed boost's slo-mo feature.<br/><br/>Super Stardust Delta boasts global leaderboards via PlayStation Network.<br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Super Stardust Delta&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "123277": {"poll": [], "name": "Jumbly", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["UK ZX Spectrum edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Abstract"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["ZX Spectrum"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["dk'Tronics"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Jumbly is a nineteen block sliding-block puzzle game, which is to say you move two-dimensional blocks through a single opening to follow a path that will lead to a specific pattern.

While searching for the hidden documents, the player must gain access into a series of warehouses, some of which house keys that then allow access to other locations. This is done by cracking a safe code in the warehouse office; cracking the safe will reward the player with a key, which can then be used to gain access to the next warehouse.

The authorities then distribute posters depicting the fugitives, promising appetizing values for each catch. Each player represents a group of armed cowboys who wants to get the opportunity to enrich easily, while working with the sheriff and his co-workers. But the prices set for each capture are not invariable and it will take as much force as diplomacy to pocket.&quot;<br/><br/>Wanted! The rewards is a tactic game of area control, where players must capture the most fugitives they can, for the highest price. Each player has 16 cards (cowboys) with a specific strenght (0 to 5) and special habilities. Each card is played to influence the meeples (fugitives) that borders it. When an area containing meeples is completly surrounded, the player with more strenght wins the current money for each of them (if there is a tie, a duel happens!). Besides surrounding areas containing fugitives, players must also make the better use of their card habilities to obtain the best rewards. This happens because the prices are variable. The player who uses best the &quot;prices market&quot; will take an important advantage, because it's preferable to capture less if the price is higher. Cards may be played face up and face down. For each card side players may choose do to the card hability or not. When playing a card face down, besides the bluff, you may move the &quot;sheriff&quot; of your color up to two intersections. This pawn has a strategic interest, because he strenghts all the player cards of his color by +1 (only the ones he touches). Some strategic combinations of cards can be made to prevent other players to gain a lot of money.<br/><br/>Besides the basic game players may choose to play it in the advanced mode, which includes a Horse which helps the player who controls it to move his sheriff further, while being stronger, and a Prison (for an ending score).<br/><br/>In June 2012 the game was finalist in the Plateau d'Or Boardgame Design Contest (Canada).<br/>In April 2013 the game was finalist among 138 in Granollers Boardgame Design Contest (Spain).<br/>In April 2013 the game won the &laquo;Coup de Coeur&raquo; prize in the NTPSLM Boardgame Design Contest (Canada) among 124 games.<br/><br/>"}, "123323": {"poll": [], "name": "Soap Quiz: Emmerdale", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1283076_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Spear's Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1283076.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Spears First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Trivia"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Small quiz game that tests your knowledge of Britain's second longest soap, Emmerdale.

From the game instructions:<br/><br/>Words were spoken at the setting of time. Words which put together told a terrifying tale, a prophecy of doom. Man had crossed into the black land and returned diseased. Evil had found a door into another Kingdom. Somehow it had to be kept shut. Prehistoric man kept vigil until it was forgotten why. Of course they thought you were crazy, but you insisted on returning to that ancient place, just to make sure. You had a feeling about these relics, a feeling of death. Unwittingly you had sprung an invisible lock of an invisible door. A prophecy is about to be fulfilled. The Dead will rise again to eat the flesh of the living.<br/><br/>Zombie Zombie had the inclusion of a helicopter which could be piloted and used to alter the terrain. To kill the zombies you had to make them follow you to a high point then let them fall off the edge.<br/><br/>Zombie Zombie also presented two notable innovations. The first was the utilisation of two-channel sound, a then unheard-of feat of a computer equipped with only a single-channel piezo buzzer as its sound source. The second was that, through the use of the Sinclair Interface 1, the game's two-channel melodies could be played back on a MIDI-equipped synthesizer. Unfortunately, although a wiring diagram was supplied with the game, the interfacing code had been tested on a Yamaha DX7 with a ROM containing bugs - so the circuit would only work on that particular synthesizer. This came to light when Sandy White attempted to demo the game while connected to an unfamiliar synthesizer.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Zombie Zombie&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "123360": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Le Monde de Nemo: La Grande Evasion", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Fishes", "Movies: Finding Nemo"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2050110_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Tilsit"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2050110.png", "boardgameversion": ["Tilsit Edition 2004"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Card Game", "Children's Game", "Racing"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Object of the game is to escape from the aquarium first.<br/><br/>In his turn player draws a card and play a card.<br/>There are usual cards to move his fish to the next available slot<br/>or special cards to exchange his hand, force opponent to discard one card etc.<br/><br/>First fish who has completed his journey to ocean is the winner<br/><br/>"}, "123361": {"poll": [], "name": "Treasure Adventure Game", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1543919.png", "videogametheme": ["Nature / Jungle", "Ocean / Sea"], "usersrated": "7", "videogamedeveloper": ["Robit Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure", "Platform", "RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "7.57143", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Robit Studios"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1543919_t.png", "description": "Treasure Adventure Game is a huge, open-world, platform adventure game created by Stephen Orlando.

It has similar game mechanics to Lords, but adds more detail and complexity with the number of characters and locations increased.<br/><br/>After Doomdark's defeat in the first game, word reaches his daughter, Shareth the Heartstealer, that he has been overthrown. Enraged by this (not out of filial devotion, but because she had been planning a particularly gruesome parricide of her own), she decides to take revenge on the chief architect of his downfall, Luxor the Moonprince, by kidnapping his son Morkin. The game revolves around Luxor and his companions Rorthron the Wise and Tarithel the Fey (Morkin's beloved), and their attempts to rescue Morkin and defeat Shareth.<br/><br/>The game has five factions to be recruited or fought: the Fey, the Barbarians, the Dwarfs, the Giants, and the Icelords. The main difference between this game and Lords is that the lords now all move and react independently, no longer content to sit in their castles and wait to be recruited. Shareth also moves around, attempting to recruit armies and lords to her cause, so a major part of the game involves recruiting sufficient forces to counter hers.<br/><br/>This makes the relationship between lords very important, as some lords can only be recruited by certain others. Certain lords are vassals of certain others, and some may only be recruited by their lieges. Recruiting a liege does not, however, automatically recruit all his vassals, nor their respective vassals. Lords may also cooperate, recruit and fight each other independently, making the world much more dynamic than the previous game.<br/><br/>There are many magic items to be found, most belonging to a single lord and having 'power in battle', as well as magic crowns, and the landscape and its features hold many surprises for the player.<br/><br/>Doomsdark's Revenge reverses the first game's victory conditions by giving the computer only a single goal, the death of Luxor, Shareth wins outright if Luxor is slain. The player has many possible levels of victory, ranging from the mere rescue of Morkin and retreat to Midnight to the destruction of Shareth and the safe return home of Luxor, Morkin, Rorthron and Tarithel.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Doomdark's Revenge&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "123389": {"poll": [], "name": "Eye of the Moon", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["ZX Spectrum edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2479966.png", "videogameseries": ["Lords of Midnight"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamefranchise": ["(Unreleased Games - Cancelled)"], "videogameplatform": ["ZX Spectrum"], "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Unknown)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2479966_t.png", "description": "<br/><br/><br/>    <br/>        <br/>UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        <br/>This game was cancelled in development.

The sequel is even mentioned in the game's manual;:&quot;The third part of the trilogy, possibly the most exciting yet, is still to come, when Mike will send Morkin down to the warmer lands which lie below Midnight itself, to find the Eye of the Moon.&quot; The Eye of the Moon was to be a magical crystal, or jewel, that allowed its owner to look into the future. According to Singleton &quot;Luxor is dying, it's some years on and he's reached the end of his tether, and he wants to see what is going to happen to Midnight in the future. So Morkin goes off in search of the magical jewel called the Eye of the Moon which enables people to see into the future, so that Luxor can then rest in peace.&quot; Some of Singleton's plans included a game canvas four times bigger than the original Lords of Midnight, divided into twelve kingdoms set south-west of the original game, dynamic full-color graphics with black masking to hide any color clashes, unique graphics for all castles, unique, generated, full-scale facial graphics for all characters, a more convincing name generator, interior scenes of keeps and citadels, et cetera. There were even tentative plans to implement a multi-player mode, using the already existing mic/ear sockets to exchange data. Despite having already created a substantial amount of new game code&mdash;essentially all the above engines --, Singleton was involved in numerous other game projects at the time and thus put the game on hiatus.<br/>1985 presentation mock-up of Midnight Identikit.<br/><br/>In an article published in July, 1985 in Computer Gamer, Singleton disclosed quite a lot of details of the game. The game was to have 16,000 locations and 131,000 unique views, created with a new technique called Randscaping. The Randscaping engine made every view unique. In multiplayer mode, the two players would each control either Morkin or Tarithel on their quest to find the fabled jewel. His new Midnight Identikit could create personalized faces for all the 256 NPC's roaming the canvas. Some of the NPC's were to have unique capabilities; for instance, one character would have the magic ability to flatten mountains, and was to be a critical reqruitment for one of the mini-quests, allowing the player access beyond an insurpassable mountain range to retrieve an item. Another NPC could control the weather, and so on. At the start of the game, the player(s) would only be able to control Morkin and Tarithel, recruiting more characters to their cause as the game progresses. The recruited characters could be made part of teams headed by a character chosen by the player, making moving the characters around the playing field a lot easier. The last attempt by Singleton to get the game released was in April, 1989.<br/><br/>Today there exists no authentic material for the Eye of the Moon. Some presentation mock-ups were created by programmer Singleton; all still available screenshots&mdash;if any&mdash;are from these faked mock-ups. While the most serious intention of both Singleton and publisher Domark indeed was to create this third part, the sequel was later indefinitely shelved, partly due to Mike Singleton's other commitments and partly due to the original publisher being bought out by Telecomsoft. Because of this, the new management wanted to change the terms of agreement, demanding two distinct versions of the game--8-bit and 16-bit versions--instead of one. Singleton refused the new agreement and the Eye of the Moon entered the realm of myth.<br/><br/>Doomdark's Revenge would, however, be followed many years later by another sequel, Lords of Midnight: The Citadel.<br/><br/>Eye of the Moon has since been mentioned for a possible upcoming release, with Mike Singleton again involved, a significant amount of work has already taken place.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Doomdark's Revenge&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "123390": {"poll": [], "name": "Lords of Midnight: The Citadel", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Windows edition", "North American Windows edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Lords of Midnight"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Real Time Strategy", "RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Domark"], "description": "Lords of Midnight: The Citadel is the second and final sequel to the classic ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC game The Lords of Midnight by Mike Singleton.  The sequel departs quite radically from its predecessors, abandoning the previous installments' turn-based movement and opting for real-time 3D movement.  The character switching from the previous games is still present, although character movement is different. Game characters can be given autonomous tasks and these are then executed independently by the game engine, without further need of player input.<br/><br/>The story of the game is a direct continuation of Doomdark's Revenge. Morkin's father, Luxor the Moonprince, who by now is an old man, sets off on a quest to find the fabled Eye of the Moon. During his quest he is captured by Boroth Wolfheart and imprisoned in a Citadel. The main quest is to aid Morkin in finding and freeing his captured father.<br/><br/>Some storyline details were changed from what had been issued as the story for the Eye of the Moon, such as the game canvas being set in the Blood March, now located south-east of Midnight, instead of south-west as the original. Further, the original story had Luxor set Morkin out on the quest for the Eye of the Moon, whereas the story of The Citadel had Luxor already captured. Game designer Singleton explained the continuity error by stating the events of The Citadel take place some 20 years prior to the events in the Eye of the Moon.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Lords of Midnight : The Citadel&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "123391": {"poll": [], "name": "Frank Bruno's Boxing", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["EU Amstrad CPC edition", "EU Commodore 64 edition", "UK ZX Spectrum edition"], "average": "6", "videogametheme": ["Sports - Boxing"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamecharacter": ["Bear Hugger"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Elite Systems"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade", "Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["Amstrad CPC", "Commodore 64", "ZX Spectrum"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Elite Systems"], "vgcharacterversion": ["Canadian Crusher"], "description": "More than just another edition release, this modified version of Super Punch-Out!! was ported to the Commodore 64, the ZX Spectrum and the Amstrad CPC, and entitled Frank Bruno's Boxing. It was developed and published by Elite Systems exclusively in Europe.<br/><br/>Instead of the nameable wire boxer, real-life boxer Frank Bruno stars as the protagonist of the game. Only the first three opponents of the Super Punch-Out!! arcade were included in the game; however, their names were changed. Bear Hugger was renamed &quot;Canadian Crusher&quot;, Dragon Chan was renamed &quot;Fling Long Chop&quot; and Vodka Drunkenski was renamed &quot;Andra Puncharedov&quot;. Five exclusive characters were added to the game: Tribal Trouble, Frenchie France, Raviolo Mafiosi, Antipodean Andy and Peter Perfect. This version of the game featured a KO meter, which was an early version of the Super meter used in modern fighting games, allowing a more powerful punch to be thrown when the bar was filled.  Frank Bruno was also doing promotion for the compilation Frank Bruno's Big Box, a collection of several different games including Frank Bruno's Boxing.<br/><br/>Encore Software later rereleased the ZX Spectrum version of Frank Bruno's Boxing as Frank Bruno's World Championship Boxing.  As in the original Punch-Out!!, the player assumes the role of a green-haired boxer, known by three initials, who works through the ranks of the WVBA (World Video Boxing Association). During matches, the player's boxer is viewed from behind as a wireframe (so the opponents can be seen). The player must time his punches, dodges and blocks in order to defeat the opposing boxer. Hints are given as to the opponent's next move by subtle eye changes (the white of the eyes turn from white to yellow), but the player must ultimately predict what moves the opponent will make and react appropriately.<br/><br/>Once the player defeats the final opponent, the player will win the Heavyweight Belt, then defend it against the same characters that he has already beaten. Each successive time they are met, the opponents are harder and quicker. For each opponent, the player must knock them out within three minutes (three knockdowns guarantees a TKO, although the opponents will sometimes stay down on the first or second one). After the player's second loss, the winning opponent comes forward and taunts the player.<br/><br/>The game is housed in a modified upright cabinet. Like the previous game, it requires two monitors, one atop the other, for the game's display. The top monitor is used to display statistics while the bottom one is the main game display. Apart from this, the game is more or less a standard upright. The game has a joystick and three buttons. Two buttons control left and right punches, one for each arm. One button delivers an uppercut or knockout blow. Unlike the original Punch-Out!!, Super-Punch-Out!! also featured a joystick which could be pulled straight up (almost as if you were trying to yank the joystick out of the machine). Doing so caused your green-haired character to duck, which was crucial in beating certain opponents.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Frank Bruno's Boxing&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "123392": {"poll": [], "name": "Grand National", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["UK ZX Spectrum edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Sports - Horse Riding"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["ZX Spectrum"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Elite Systems"], "description": "Grand National is a British computer game that was developed by Andy Williams and Paul Holmes based on the horse race of the same name.

The game was released for the ZX Spectrum in July 1985, with the Commodore 64 release following one month later, and the Amstrad CPC conversion in 1986. The gameplay was split into three parts, and large sections of the programming was outsourced to others: Andrew Glaister (program conversion Spectrum, parts one and two), Dave Jones (programming Spectrum, part three), Ray Owen (graphics Spectrum, part three) and John Gibbons (programming C64, part three). The IBM PC version was developed for the Electronic Pencil company, by a developer called Brian Mallett. The PC version was written in 8086 assembler and used CGA graphics in 4 colour mode.

Most cards involve moving a specific Slime a specific number of spaces, but several special cards apply to Slimes in certain race positions (e.g. The Slime in first place may double the distance between it and the Slime in second). Some Slimes have a better set of movement cards than others, and therefore receive lower odds on the betting chart.<br/>Players each get a hand of 7 cards. Depending on what cards a player has, they can form a strategy for which Slimes they think they can push into first and second place at the finish line. The players bet on which Slimes they think will win. Players then take turns playing cards to move the Slimes until there is a first and second place winner. Players tally up their score and advance their score marker. First player to reach 50 points wins the game.<br/><br/>The rulebook is in Japanese, but there are many illustrations, so it is possible to figure out the rules.<br/><br/>"}, "123400": {"poll": [], "name": "Norrland", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows CD-ROM edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "10", "videogametheme": ["Hunting", "Minigame Compilation", "Morbid", "Surreal"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Other"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Norrland was made for an art exhibition at Kulturbygden in Sollefte&aring;, V&auml;sternorrland County, Sweden.

Each ball is launched from some sort of spring-loaded 'shooter' or cue, to the top of the board, where it then rolls towards the player, bouncing off the pins or landing in any of several scoring pockets.  These scoring pockets can be depressions in the playfield, nails arranged in a U-shape, or both.  They are marked with various score values, with the higher values usually protected by more pins or tougher paths to reach them.  By &quot;shooting&quot; the ball harder or softer, the player can try to control where the ball drops.<br/><br/>A spring-loaded shooter is normally in the bottom right corner of the board. A ball is placed before the shooter mechanism. The shooter devise is pulled back and let go, with the aim to fire the ball up to the rounded end of the board and then to bounce around the nails or pins and, hopefully, land in a scoring area. A cue shooter is just a wooden object, rather like a miniature version of a Billiards cue. To launch a ball, the player merely shoots it by hitting the back of the ball with the cue thus sending it to the top of the board.<br/><br/>Note that it is possible for a ball not to score at all. This usually means that the ball reached the bottom of the board without settling into a scoring pocket.<br/><br/>Typically, a player might get 3 or more balls and a note of the total score achieved is taken. The first to reach a pre-agreed number of points, wins.<br/><br/>Bagatelle sets can be made of wood, metal or plastic and they can be of any size (but it must be able to stand on an average table). They are often linked to a theme, really as an excuse to feature related graphics.

The gameplay was much slower and jumps and flying can take a lot of time and effort to perform correctly. There also seems to be a certain influence from Underwurlde in the gameplay and sounds used in the game.

It has 32 kilobytes of RAM, and its ROM includes BBC BASIC along with its operating system.<br/><br/>The Electron was able to save and load programs onto audio cassette via a supplied converter cable that connected it to any standard tape recorder that had the correct sockets. It was capable of basic graphics, and could display onto either a television set, a colour (RGB) monitor or a &quot;green screen&quot; monitor.<br/><br/>At its peak, the Electron was the third best selling micro in the United Kingdom, and total lifetime game sales for the Electron exceeded those of the BBC Micro. There are at least 500 known games for the Electron and the true total is probably in the thousands[citation needed].<br/><br/>The hardware of the BBC Micro was emulated by a single customized ULA chip designed by Acorn. It had feature limitations such as being unable to output more than one channel of sound where the BBC was capable of three-way polyphony (plus one noise channel) and the inability to provide teletext mode.<br/><br/>The ULA controlled memory access and was able to provide 32K &times; 8 bits of addressable RAM using 4 &times; 64K &times; 1-bit RAM chips (4164). Due to needing two accesses to each chip instead of one, and the complications of the video hardware also needing access, reading or writing RAM was much slower than on the BBC Micro. This meant that although ROM applications ran at the same speed, there was a substantial speed decrease on applications running from RAM.<br/><br/>The Electron was developed during 1983 as a cheap sibling for the BBC Micro with the intention of capturing the low-cost Christmas sales market for that year. Although Acorn were able to shrink substantially the same functionality as the BBC into just one chip, manufacturing problems meant that very few machines were available for the Christmas period &mdash; to the extent that some shops reported eight presales for every delivered machine.<br/><br/>This was a blow from which the machine never fully recovered, although games sales for it would ultimately outstrip those of the BBC Micro. Following Olivetti's 1985 cash injection into Acorn the machine was effectively sidelined.<br/><br/>With hindsight, the machine lacked the RAM (a typical program would need to fit in only around 20 kB once display memory is subtracted) and processing power to take on the prevailing Sinclair ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64. Despite this, several features that would later be associated with BBC Master and Archimedes were first features of Electron expansion units, including ROM cartridge slots and the Advanced Disc Filing System &mdash; a hierarchical improvement to the BBC's original Disc Filing System.<br/><br/>Whilst it may not have been as popular as the Spectrum, Commodore 64 or Amstrad CPC, it did sell in sufficient numbers to ensure that new software was being produced right up until the early 1990s. This meant the Electron had a lifespan not much shorter than those more popular micros and much longer than competitors such as the Oric-1 and Dragon 32.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Acorn Electron&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "123436": {"statistics": [], "name": "BBC Micro", "usersrated": "1", "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3366492.jpg", "videogamehwversion": ["BBC Micro Model A", "BBC Micro Model B", "BBC Micro Model B+128", "BBC Micro Model B+64"], "videogamehardwarecategory": ["Console"], "average": "9", "videogamehardware": ["BBC Micro"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3366492_t.jpg", "videogamehwmfg": ["Acorn Computers"], "description": "The BBC Microcomputer System, or BBC Micro, was a series of microcomputers and associated peripherals designed and built by Acorn Computers for the BBC Computer Literacy Project, operated by the British Broadcasting Corporation.

Renamed the BBC Micro, the platform was adopted by most schools and became a cornerstone of computing in British education in the 1980s, changing Acorn's fortunes. It was also moderately successful as a home computer in the United Kingdom despite its high cost.

In the simplest version of a round, the card played with the highest Irony value wins that round. If someone has played an Event card in the front position, then the round gets skewed in some fashion (explained on the card). Such things that could happen are the player with the lowest value wins, or you use the Irony value of both cards, etc.<br/><br/>When an event card is played, that is when the card to your right will be turned over. Some event cards also require you to play a third card onto the table.<br/><br/>After a winner for the round is determined, the round is over, and everyone puts any non-displayed cards back into their Six Pack, and draw back up to 6 cards if the Six Pack is not complete.<br/><br/>First player to win 7 rounds is the winner!<br/><br/>"}, "123457": {"rpgartist": ["Nick Bradshaw", "Niklas Brandt", "Kent Burles", "Mark Dudley", "Steve Edwards", "Joseph Scott Lawn", "Kevin Long", "Apollo Okamura", "Zachary Schoenbaum"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Rifter (Issue 52 - Oct 2010)", "rpgdesigner": ["James Cannon", "Travis Guerrero", "Paul Herbert", "Andrew Landers", "Kevin Siembieda"], "rpgproducer": ["Alex Marciniszyn", "Julius Rosenstein", "Kevin Siembieda", "Wayne Smith"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1610723.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["The Rifter"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Cannibal Magic", "from Ruins to Runes", "From the Desk of Kevein Siembieda", "The Crusaders & Black Crusade", "The Hammer of the Forge"], "rpg": ["Palladium Fantasy Role-Playing Game (2nd Edition)", "Rifts"], "rpgpublisher": ["Palladium Books"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF version", "Soft Cover"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1610723_t.jpg", "description": "The Rifter&reg; is your doorway to unlimited imagination and numerous Palladium role-playing worlds.
