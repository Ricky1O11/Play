Whatever your desire, the options and rules presented are intended to give you the utmost convenience and flexibility to make incredible anthro characters.<br/><br/>About Anthros<br/><br/>Anthro is a term that collectively refers to creatures of numerous races of anthropomorphic animals. All anthros have the humanoid creature type, appended with the (anthro) tag.<br/><br/>The typical anthro (if there is such a thing), is roughly human-sized and shaped. They have animalistic skulls, though sometimes the muzzle is shortened, giving the anthro a somewhat more human profile. While fur is the dominant skin covering for anthros (hence, the race&rsquo;s most common slang epithet: furry), other bloodlines might boast colorful plumage, a variety of reptilian and piscine scales, or even a chitin exoskeleton.<br/><br/>Fursona 5E is an update to the series for D&amp;D 5th Edition. It contains converted content from the original Fursona:The Definitive Guide to Creating Anthropomorphic Characters, plus new material exclusive to this sourcebook.<br/><br/>It features a streamlined approach to character creation, so generating an anthro has never been easier.

Now and again those nations&rsquo; armies would try to hunt down the worst of them, only to inevitably fall to the bog itself.

But he finally found it, and it was time to send a pigeon to that irritating halfling. Soon the cult would pay - one bit at a time.<br/><br/>The Hideout provides 5 scenarios, which are rather different from the Abyssal Rift main campaign. Should you manage to beat the cult, you'll secure a safe haven, at least for a time, allowing recovery and restocking.

Raids, sieges, naval battles, Indian alliances&hellip; nothing is left out.<br/><br/>One side controls the French and the other the British. The board covers the area from Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, to Virginia. It includes wilderness sites, Indian villages and British and French colonies with their settlements. Movement is point-to-point on land. Pieces can also be transported at sea. The French player starts with the most Indian allies in play. There are also neutral Indians who will eventually join one side or the other.<br/><br/>Bayonets &amp; Tomahawks offers scenarios that range from one year duration to the full campaign (5 years). In each, the British player can achieve victory by capturing a set number of key sites by game end (e.g. Louisbourg, Qu&eacute;bec, Ohio Forks, etc.). The French can win by preventing this or by knocking out the British colonies with raids in any single year. Each year has eight Action rounds where movement, constructions, and battles take place; and three Logistics rounds where fleets arrive with reinforcements, colonials enlist, pieces return to colonies for winter and reserve supply is drawn.<br/><br/>Action tokens drive the game: both players start the year with one reserve action token and draw a new one at the beginning of each Action round. They then secretly bid one of their tokens for the present round. Each supply point (SP) on a token allows one stack of pieces to perform one action: e.g. raid, muster, movement, construction, etc. With a varying number of SP per token, there&rsquo;s a built in degree of uncertainty for players regarding their capacity to act during each round.<br/><br/>With a diverse unit mix and game mechanics that immerse players in the fascinating military asymmetries of the 18th-Century colonial frontier, Bayonets &amp; Tomahawks will ensure fun for players of all levels.<br/><br/>"}, "206510": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Meeple Monthly (Issue 43 - Jul 2016)", "rpgdesigner": ["Sharang Biswas", "George Gonzalez", "Scott Morris", "Joe Neet", "Mike Richie", "Max Seidman"], "rpgproducer": ["Sam Peterson", "Jenna Piller"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3136555.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Meeple Monthly"], "rpgissuearticle": ["August 2016 Additional Releases", "Digging Deeper with Quartz", "Enter the Deadzone", "How to Ace Your Oral History Report", "New Releases September 2016", "Table of Contents", "The Weird Little Details", "We Come in Peace"], "rpgpublisher": ["ACD Distribution, LLC"], "rpgissueversion": ["Standard Edition"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3136555_t.jpg", "description": "Meeple Monthly<br/>Issue 43<br/>July 2016<br/><br/>Passport Game Studios' Quartz<br/>Mad Science Foundation<br/>Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Boardgame<br/>Deadzone<br/><br/>"}, "206511": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Dr. Rob Lusk"], "average": "6", "poll": [], "name": "Battles Before Time", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3137152_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Don Jackson", "Chris Malidore", "Chuck Quilty"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Jade Tower Studio"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3137152.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Fantasy", "Miniatures", "Prehistoric"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Battles Before Time is a prehistoric fantasy miniatures skirmish game for 28mm figures (as well as plastic dinosaurs &amp; giant mammals that more or less fit with 28mm cavemen).

Consider your investigators carefully, because it will take exceptional strength and will to escape a threatening Byakhee or an unsettling Nightgaunt.<br/><br/>The Suppressed Memories scenario is based on the collection&rsquo;s Call of the Wild content, meaning those with the original Call of the Wild expansion will be able to play as well. Adding the Forbidden Alchemy expansion as well, however, will increase the number of scenario variants available to you. Fans of the original game may recognize this scenario as a reimagining of a First Edition scenario, featuring the return of Zebulon Whately and an attempt to interrupt a sinister happening in Dunwich.

A key feature is that the game requires no erasing, so once an adventure is completed, the player can see every action they took on the page.<br/><br/>Players begin by designing a character using the games five skills, Dexterity, Ranged, Endurance, Accumen and Melee. Purchase equipment, and then set off to fight or outwit a dungeon full of monsters, finally clashing with the boss.<br/><br/>Players track their movement through the dungeon on a 5x6 grid. Upon entering a room, roll a die, add your depth, and look up the resulting number in the Bestiary. This can reveal anything from a chest full of loot, to a deadly trap, to a terrifying monster. Once they know what they're dealing with, players can choose how they want to deal with the situation. A roguish character may want to sneak past, or even risk pickpocketing a monster. A stronger character might simply choose a direct attack. A magically attuned character might try casting a charm spell. Each of these actions are performed using a single die roll, and players get a bonus based on thier character's statistics.<br/><br/>Sometimes a player might not be able to play to their strengths, such as an archer running out of arrows, or a swordsman fighting a flying enemy.

Despite our talents and skills, our culture tells us&mdash;over and over again&mdash;to make ourselves small physically, emotionally, and intellectually, to do extra work without complaint, to let others take the credit. We are feminists because we do not accept that the price of occupying a space marked &quot;woman&quot; is self-effacement.<br/><br/>We are feminists because we believe that every human should have the opportunity to live up to their fullest potential. In today&rsquo;s world, that is simply not possible. Sexism oppresses everyone, whether it&rsquo;s the woman who does a second shift of housework at the end of her paying job, the man whose parental love for a child is deemed suspect, or the trans and gender-queer people whose identities are erased on census form.<br/><br/>We are feminists who believe that the culture we consume can help us begin to undo the harms of sexism. And yet, that is difficult when our culture and its consumption is steeped in it. In the literary world, there is an old adage that books about men speak to &quot;humanity&quot; while books about women are &quot;for women.&quot;<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s true in the world of roleplaying games too. Scenarios about five men doing, well, nearly anything, get labeled as &quot;great games,&quot; while scenarios that focus on women's experiences are &quot;for women.&quot; We want to expand the designation of &quot;great games&quot; to include works that speak to our own lived experience. Feminism belongs in analog game design because women are human too. We produced this collection to highlight feminist voices and to create space for explicitly feminist design.<br/><br/>Our designers had juicy ground to draw from. Game-wise, what could be better source material than a world that pushes people into unequal power relationships, regardless of their skills and interests? This collection highlights different aspects of that power dynamic, from situational comedy to high tragedy.<br/><br/>Our feminism is an inclusive and plural feminism. We welcomed participants of all genders and game design experience, and accepted all the games they produced. We asked each designer to write a game about an aspect of feminism that is important to them right now. Rather than culling the collection to fit our own ideology, we tried to help each author realize their own vision. With nearly three dozen designers, these games represent many different feminisms, reflective of their individual authors.<br/><br/>As legendary feminist bell hooks once wrote, &quot;Feminism is for everybody.&quot; We wanted to make these games accessible to players of all genders and ideologies. The barrier to entry is low. Our games require few participants, little in the way of prep or props, and last an hour or less. They cover a wide range of topics and moods, so you&rsquo;ll find funnier scenarios about the word &quot;vulvas,&quot; dramas about women in the workplace, and heavier scenarios about rape and domestic violence.<br/><br/>We hope these games will help generate discussion in your community and inspire you to make your own feminist works.<br/><br/>"}, "206684": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Romance of the Perilous Land", "rpgdesigner": ["Scott Malthouse"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3138469.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy", "Mythology / Folklore"], "rpgpublisher": ["Trollish Delver Games"], "rpg": ["Romance of the Perilous Land"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3138469_t.jpg", "description": "(publisher blurb)<br/><br/>ROMANCE OF THE PERILOUS LAND is a game very much inspired by the oldest fantasy roleplaying game created in the 1970s,  but it is also its own creation.

The cards come in six colors, which match the six regions of Ethnos. Place three glory tokens in each region, arranging them from low to high.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with one card in hand, then 4-12 cards are placed face up on the table. On a turn, a player either recruits an ally or plays a band of allies. In the former case, you take a face-up card (without replacing it from the deck) or the top card of the deck and add it to your hand. In the latter case, you choose a set of cards in your hand that match either in tribe or in color, play them in front of you on the table, then discard all other cards in hand. You then place one or more tokens in the region that matches the color of the top card just played, and you use the power of the tribe member on the top card just played.<br/><br/>At the end of the first age, whoever has the most tokens in a region scores the glory shown on the first token.

(Not that anyone can remember what a gutter is, these days, but the general feeling is that it was something rather unpleasant, if fairly useful.)<br/><br/>And it was that heading &quot;Die Mutant Alien Scum&quot; that caused all the bother when it appeared in a space-wide holo-edition of the SoonDay Spirit. After several centuries of reading &quot;little green men turned me into a potato&quot; stories invented by SoonDay Spirit journalists, aliens throughout space were beginning to get just a little bit fed up with humanity. Naturally, human diplomats did their best to repair the damage, but your average little green man reading the SoonDay Spirit on the top of a Venusian omnibus wasn't swayed. As time went on, he got more and more fed up with being slandered and vilified in the holo-outpourings of a small and insignificant bipedal race that lived on a dirty little planet in the Sol system.<br/><br/>When the crazed SoonDay Spirit headline writer finally flipped his xenophobic lid and came up with DIE MUTANT ALIEN SCUM as a front-page lead story for the early edition one Tuesday, the clamour of outrage comng trom the top of the omnibuses throughout the galaxy could be heard on Earth. Alien anger continued to mount, and by the middle of Wednesday morning, political leaders on every civilized world in the galaxy realised there was only one course of action open to them if they wanted to get re-elected by their people: declare war on Earth.<br/><br/>So by lunchtime on Wednesday, every civilised race in the galaxy had declared war on Earth, the human race, and in particular all journalists working for the SoonDay Spirit. Expecting an easy victory in the game 'Earth V The Rest of God's Creations', alien hordes set out for the time-space adjacent to Earth and prepared to do battle with humanity's feeble space fleets. But they hadn't reckoned on the ingenuity of Earth's weapons scientists; they didn't realise that the Gemini Wing figher project was already complete. And their spies had spent so much time on earth chasing girlies and turning them into potatoes to report back on the development of awesome weapon systems such as the Windscreen Wiper of Death ....<br/><br/>What at first seemed to be an easy victory for alien forces turned into a bitterly-fought conflict, a space-war that is still raging in several dimensions. Which is about where you come in, as the pilot of a Gemini Wing fighter. Pausing only to shout the battle cry of the crack GW regiment you belong to - &quot;Die Mutant Alien Scum&quot; - you leap into the control seat of your craft, warp to a vertically-scrolling etherworld and start fighting the good fight ....<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>This is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up. The power-up system is interesting in that one-off shots of special weapons are collected and stream behind you ship in coloured orbs. Firing the alternative weapon shoots the weapons from the orbs in the order they were collected.<br/><br/>Most of the home versions state &quot;Produced by The Sales Curve Ltd for Virgin Mastertronic Ltd.

Among them was The Dramatist Approach in which the GM would say, &quot;Yes, you ARE completely annihilated by the horde of reporters and NO, I do _not_ have to roll dice to determine this&quot;; and The Chartmaster Approach in which the GM would say, &quot;Wait, 2^m beings trying to trample your character.

On the surface, it looks much like the world you and I live in. Just beneath that surface, in the shadows, rages an ancient conflict between supernatural factions who all seek dominion over the Earth and control over the souls of humanity. Angels, in service to Yahweh, fight to hang on to their failing grasp of the Earth. Demons, with a legion of Hellspawn at their disposal, ramp up aggression in an attempt to usher in the apocalypse. In the middle, various supernatural races and conspiracies push to make room for their own agendas in a shrinking world.<br/><br/>On the Winter Solstice of 2012, ancient gods known as the Ilu, long ago imprisoned by Yahweh and his angels, were released onto the Earth by Lucifer. The Ilu formed factions and began spreading out across the globe, trying to learn all they could about humanity and hoping to regain some semblance of their lost power and worship. In response to the reemergence of the Ilu, Yahweh ordered his angels to prepare for war. Only one among the heavenly host spoke of trying to bring the Ilu into the fold. Once the angels were told to ready for battle, the Archangel Tyra sought a private audience with Yahweh, offering a peaceful and diplomatic solution. In response, Yahweh cast her down for daring to question his orders. Yahweh hid this sin from the rest of the host, telling the other Archangels that Tyra had been sent on a secret mission of vital import within the Void.<br/><br/>Now, as the Ilu slowly gain a foothold on Earth, the forces of Heaven prepare for outright war. To add another level of looming doom to the mix, Hell&rsquo;s army, now under the command of Azmodeus, seeks to kickstart the apocalypse by any means available. The world is in a bad way, and for the first time in centuries, open war among the supernatural seems not only likely, but inevitable.<br/><br/>Slouching Towards Bethlehem places the player characters front and center in this looming conflict. This book contains a series of adventures designed to drag the player characters into the war and set up their choices to have a profound impact on how major, earth shaking events play out. Within these pages you will find a number of adventures and scenarios that will lead the characters to ground zero of a major event in the world of Contagion. How the characters handle these scenarios could determine the fate of mankind, Heaven and Hell. The characters could become the greatest of heroes or the foulest of villains. Their actions may save the world, or they may damn it.<br/><br/>Slouching Towards Bethlehem is a literal game-changer. The events within these pages will irrevocably alter the world of Contagion, though the degree to which things truly change is up to you, the players, and the dice. Given the scope of the events presented in this book it is highly unlikely that the world of Contagion on the whole will survive unscathed.<br/><br/>Slouching Towards Bethlehem contains:<br/><br/>    A ten chapter campaign for use with Contagion Second Edition<br/>    Earth-shaking events that will forever change the status quo of the world of Contagion<br/>    Game statistics for 20 ready to use NPCs, including never before seen characters as well as advanced statistics for characters featured in Falling Stars, Old Faces for a New World &amp; more.<br/>    Details on the whereabouts and plans of several prominent NPCs such as Archangel Tyra, Azmodeus, and Lucifer.<br/>    Detailed information on Mauston, Wisconsin, a complete and detailed setting for use in your campaign.<br/>    Detailed maps and interior art by Jack Badashski<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "206792": {"rpgdesigner": ["Wojciech Gruchala"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "statistics": [], "name": "Kemonomimi: Moe Options", "rpgartist": ["Sasha Turk"], "rpgproducer": ["Greg LaRose"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3139736.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Culture (Asian / Far Eastern)", "Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Mythology / Folklore"], "rpgpublisher": ["Amora Game"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3139736_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Moe Options?

In the original release, we had a projection (spell rune) specialist (the projector), an archetype built around a cape rune that gave the wearer arcane trickster functionality (the campaigner), and a way to duplicate equipment runes with slaved &quot;rentals&quot; (the forgemaster). The new animator archetype goes off in a totally different direction by trading away projection runes to gain animated objects as familiars.<br/><br/>Animated objects are really quite interesting, as the core rules grant them an entire customizability engine through construction points, or CP. The animator expands upon the CP system in two ways. First, by expending a couple of rune inscription points, an animated object can be given more CP. Second, the runesmith can spend said CP to give an animated object one or more equipment rune inscription slots. This second option takes an already-expansive system and adds half the spell options of an entire base class<br/><br/>In the end, the animator archetype is all about producing one or more customizable familiars each and every day at no cost, then piling on native enhancements and runes until it's the perfect throwaway pet.

It is said that it &quot;survived its own death&quot;, and there is truth in this. Poland's capital was largely destroyed during the Second World War, and its reconstruction was an exceptional urban development process. Warsaw is a combination of elegant buildings from Saxon times, architecture from between the World Wars, socialist blocks, and modern buildings. Walking through the streets of Warsaw's Wola district, one can see this diversity at a glance. Modern glass office buildings stand next to pre-war automotive garages, and concrete block buildings touch elegant older houses, which show the signs of time's decay. Some call it a spatial mess, while others see in it the residents' determination. Both views are right because that's how Warsaw is. Maybe not the most beautiful, but strong and determined. Nothing reflects the city's character more than its diverse buildings.<br/><br/>In Capital, players jointly build Warsaw over six epochs, from when Warsaw first became the capital at the end of the 16th century through modern times. Each player creates their own district of the city. At the end of each of the six epochs, districts give income and victory points to their owners. After six rounds, whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>In more detail, each epoch consists of a construction phase and an income phase, with wars at the end of the third and fourth epochs. During the construction phase of an epoch, players shuffle the city tiles with the current epoch's number, then deal several tiles to each player. Each player chooses one of the tiles, then places it face down onto the table. All players simultaneously reveal their selected tiles, and each player chooses one of two possible actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Discard their tile to the box and take three coins from the bank.<br/>     Pay the tile's cost in coins and build the tile in their district.<br/><br/><br/>Instead of placing a tile on an empty space, a player may choose to build on top of an existing tile. Simply place the new tile directly onto an existing tile, covering it completely. As a result, the new tile's price is reduced by the price of the older tile that it covers. A player's district can never be larger than a 3&times;4 or 4&times;3 rectangle of tiles. Each city tile is divided into four quarters, and each quarter has its own type of building, so a tile can have 1-4 different kinds of buildings. Public buildings and milestones are always separate individual areas, even if they are adjacent to each other. They also occupy an entire tile.<br/><br/>During the income phase, milestones are placed, and players receive coins and victory points.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "Polish first edition"], "average": "7.48841", "name": "Capital", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Tile Placement"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "415", "boardgamefamily": ["Cities: Warsaw"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["HLG-EXTRA 4: Spiel 2016 Deel 2"]}, "206804": {"poll": [], "name": "Cup Football", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English / European Amstrad CPC Cassette edition", "English / European Commodore 64 Cassette (EDOS re-release) edition", "English / European Commodore 64 Cassette edition", "English / European ZX Spectrum Cassette (EDOS re-release) edition", "English / European ZX Spectrum Cassette edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3161019.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Sports - Soccer"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Management", "Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Amstrad CPC", "Commodore 64", "ZX Spectrum"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Cult Games", "D&H Games", "Electronic Distribution of Software (EDOS)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3161019_t.jpg", "description": "From the inlay:<br/><br/>Cup Football is a gmae set amongst the top European Clubs.

The civil war of a decade ago is but a memory, and the Flavians have restored peace and order to all corners of the empire, save one. The people of Brittania remain fiercely resistant to the will of their Roman masters, and the emperor has charged YOU with the seemingly impossible task of bringing them to heel.<br/><br/>Agricola, Master of Britain is a solitaire game of governance and conquest. To master the delicate political situation, you will need the right blend of military force, administration, bribery, and diplomacy. Every action you take matters, changing how the native populace feels about you and your rule. But you'll never know exactly who's with you or against you, because the game tracks this &quot;under the hood&quot;, or, more precisely, &quot;in the cup&quot;.<br/><br/>Three chit-pull cups (Friendly, Unfriendly, and Hostile) represent the allegiances of the units contained within those cups. After each action you take, one or more of these units are blindly moved from one cup to another. You'll have a general idea of &quot;I'm really cheesing them off&quot; or &quot;I should have a lot of friendlies available for recruitment&quot;, but until you pull a chit, you won't know who your friends really are, or where the next rebellion will spring up. This isn't totally random: certain tribes naturally skew more in one direction or the other, and taking actions to stabilize a region after it's been pacified will diminish the chances of revolt there.<br/><br/>Building the right armies, and taking the right actions at the right time is key to your success. But the Flavians - and particularly the hated Domitian - expect greater and greater results with each campaign season.

While the book was created with ICONS in mind, there are many reasons that this is an essential resource for GMs of any superhero game.<br/><br/>The book classifies super villains not by what they can do (for example, &quot;control magnetism&quot;) but by their role in the story (&quot;I must make the world safe for my people!&quot;).
