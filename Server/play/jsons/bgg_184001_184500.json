The final step of character creation is equipping the character which is more straightforward then generating the statistics.<br/><br/>Combat and opposed skills are resolves through processes which utilize d12 rolls against target numbers.  There are numerous modifiers for situational effects.  Damage is handled through effects tables.  Magical effects are detailed in separate chapters and unwilling targets receive resistance rolls.

Priestly magic is based on Religions and Cults and is somewhat less complicated.<br/><br/>The core book also includes three major sections on Tigmar, The World of Cinis.

Dolemon Drake, a local hero, gives the call to all brave souls to join him in eradicating the devilish creatures infesting the sewers. Will our heroes join in Drake's noble fight?<br/><br/><br/>Toast of the Town is an adventure module for Risus: The Anything RPG in traditional-fantasy mode, designed for a single session of play. Toast of the Town runs well for as many as six Player Characters and a Game Master, but works best with small groups (2-4 PCs), or as a one-on-one adventure with a single Player CHaracter. Toast plays well with nearly any power-level: maxed-out clich&eacute;s and magic toys will have their uses, but won't erase any of the adventure's core challenges, which are social, ethical, moral and logistical. The adventure's core delights are those of character interaction, environment-exploration, and creative problem-solving.<br/><br/>The adventure's tone leans towards the pulpy and heroic. There is a villain with victims, and the PCs should be the sort motivated by a desire to help innocents in need. Purely mercenary delvers might be tempted by the potential for secondary rewards, or driven by curiosity, but the adventure's immediacy depends on a streak of empathy in the group, even if they tuck it under the surface in that scoundrel-with-a-heart-of-gold way. Toast of the Town is not specifically comedic; it's swashbuckly, where comedy elements will emerge from the eccentricity of the townsfolk or the general madness of Player Characters. The basic situation is, honestly, a bit grim.<br/><br/>The events of Toast of the Town stand alone, but also provide the foundation for the Saint August series of modules, each set within reach of the same town, and the same mountain lake.

For example, each Race, Ability, and Skill is purchased with points from the same pool.  Character generation is very complicated and involved (and involves several scores that are not thereafter referenced in the rules).  Race selection has a significant impact on subsequent character development.  There are twelve Races, namely: Blue Elf, Catling, Dogling, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Halfing, Human, Nephilim, Ogre, Pixie/Sprite, and Xenophobe.  Some races have a negative point cost, thus returning points to the common pool.  Half races of any combination are optional.  Height, weight, appearance, and age are generated randomly.  Social Status also is randomly determine and subsequently determines starting money.  Curiously, the character then selects an Myers&ndash;Briggs Type Indicator during personality determination (personality determination is quite complex).  Characters also select Blessings and Tests, which are used during campaign play.  Characters select one or more Skills from a lengthy list.  The character is then equipped.<br/><br/>For spellcasting characters, an equally detailed but separate process is followed to determine magical power, power pool points, and specific magical abilities.  Psionics are treated as a magic system.  The spellcaster generation also results in a starting spell list.<br/><br/>The remainder of the core rules is devoted to Combat and opposed skill resolution.  Combat, played on a hex grid, requires players to perform &quot;action declarations&quot; prior to each round; this locks in a specific action.  The round then proceeds through two phases (movement, combat) with characters acting in initiative or surprise order.  Combat supports several &quot;Extreme Dice Roll&quot; results, ranging from Fumbles (broken weapons, etc.) to Critical Hits (see below).  Several types of attacks are supported, such as &quot;Careful Aim&quot;, &quot;Disarm Attack&quot;, and &quot;Charging&quot;, etc.  A variety of special combat actions also are detailed (Tackle, Grappe, Sweep, Throw Heavy Object, etc.).<br/><br/>The remainder of the core rules provides Technology options and a bestiary, and a collection of tables.

The sum, positive or negative, is added to the Skill and Attribute score of the character and the target difficulty is subtracted from this to yield a negative number (failure) or a positive number (success).  Actions that take longer than a moment are called &quot;Tasks&quot; and use a series of skill checks to determine overall success.<br/><br/>Damage in combat is derived from either the characters HTH Damage plus a weapon modifier (for e.g., swords), or simply by a weapon standard damage number (for e.g., firearms).

Rolling both dice and joints, players make their way around the board in a quest for the perfect buzz while completing hilarious challenges and satisfying their lust for &ldquo;munchies.&rdquo; Pass the Grass can be played with 2 or more players but they must be 21 or over. Clearly, this is a game for adults (cough).<br/><br/>Take turns drawing cards (and puffs) and complete challenges to win. Includes: 1 game board, 2 dice, 6 game &quot;tokens,&quot; 2 decks of cards, and a rule book.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY: Everybody puts $1 in the jackpot. There are two sets of cards, you roll dice and there are places on the board that tell you to do different things. You take a card, and each card will tell you to do something different. There are credit and pass cards. A credit card means you do what the card says, which could be anything from taking a hit off a joint, to eating some munchies, to telling an embarrassing story. If you take a pass card, you pass it to anybody and then they have to do it. If they choose not to, they&rsquo;re out. If you land on the jackpot, you get all the money and everyone replenishes it with $1 each, but it can be more if players want. Players who choose not to ante up are out. Last player still playing wins the pot. (Everyone else wins a nice buzz.) For a shorter game, play ends when someone lands on the jackpot.<br/><br/>Players may substitute a shot of booze for a puff of pot.<br/><br/>"}, "184366": {"rpgartist": ["Earl Geier", "Christian Hanisch", "Pascal Kamp", "Thorsten Kettermann"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Der Teufelspakt", "rpgdesigner": ["Keith Herber"], "rpgproducer": ["Frank Heller", "Bettina Scholten"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2673295.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Cthulhu Classic (1920s & 1930s)"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)", "Pegasus Spiele"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Horror (Cthulhu Mythos)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2673295_t.jpg", "description": "From the Publisher<br/><br/>Im Boston Globe erscheint ein Artikel mit einem Bericht &uuml;ber einen Leichenfund auf dem Fairfax-Friedhof in Salem, Massachusetts.<br/>Zeit: 1920er Jahre<br/><br/>"}, "184367": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Tomoki Kondoh"], "poll": [], "name": "Twilight of Shogun", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Area Control / Area Influence", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "15", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2674353_t.jpg", "average": "7.3", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Game Journal"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2674353.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Civil War", "Political", "Wargame"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "This is a game on political conflict in the last years of Japanese Edo period (1856 to 1867).

The basic rules are solid but not completely developed.<br/><br/>Characters have five &quot;Characteristics&quot; (Strength, Speed, Will, Reason, Creativity) with values assigned from a pool of 20 points.  Values must be between 1 and 6.<br/><br/>Characters then select Skills and assign a &quot;Skill Rating&quot; to each skill from another pool of 20 points.  Selected Skills must have at least one point allocated and cannot have more points allocated than the value for the Characteristic linked to the Skill.  In this system, combat ability is a skill, including:  Aiming Skill (firearms), Archery, Axe Weapons, Blade Weapons, Club Weapons, Shield, Thrown Weapons, Thrusting Weapons, and Unarmed Combat.  Characters that do not take any combat-related skills cannot participate effectively in combat.  A successful combat use of combat Skills may not deal damage if the opponent in turn successfully utilizes a defensive Skill.  There is no mechanism noted for advancing Skill Ratings.<br/><br/>Damage usually ranges from 0 to 7 and is applied to the value of a Characteristic, which in turn will decrease Skill performance for Skills linked to the damaged Characteristic.  Generally, Damage is first applied to Strength or Speed until those scores are reduced to zero, then Damage is done to Will.  When Will is reduced to zero the character dies.<br/><br/>When an action is critical or opposed, the GM will call for a Skill check which is made using 2d6; the roll must be under the Skill Rating for success (the rules do not specify what happens if the roll equals the Skill Rating.  Various degrees of success are possible depending on the roll, namely:  Success, Superior Success, and Critical Success.<br/><br/>The document lists thirty-nine Skills and states that each Skill has component &quot;Secondary Skills&quot;, but these are not given in the rules except for Agriculture (Animal Husbandry, Horticulture) and an inferred Attack and a stated Parry under each hand weapon skill, or Attack and Dodge for Unarmed Combat.<br/><br/>Finally, the Speed Characteristics determines how many separate actions a character can complete in a single round of combat.  Each action has a speed cost (not noted in the rules) which is subtracted from a Speed Characteristic pool (renewed each round).  When the pool is expended the character can no longer act.<br/><br/>Note that as published, the rules would be difficult to use for a campaign; an experienced GM would have to make numerous assumptions and extensions.<br/><br/>"}, "184396": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Core Elements:  Revised Edition", "rpgdesigner": ["James D.

It also supports multi-genre mashup campaigns.<br/><br/>Characters are defined by Abilities, Races, Alignments, Levels, Ranks, and Skills.  Characters gain levels and &quot;Character Points&quot; by earning experience points.  Character Points are spent to purchase increased Ability scores or Skill ranks.<br/><br/>Characters have six Abilities, including:  Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

Skills are then purchased, expending the Character Points pool.  Skills are limited by the GM based upon the genre desired for the campaign.  A character has a &quot;Class&quot;, but this is primarily descriptive text based upon character concept.  Alternately, the GM can link specific Skills to specific classes.<br/><br/>Race is selected by the character, limited only by the GM and the campaign.

Alignment is also selected by the character, and follows the standard Lawful-Chaotic / Good-Evil dual-axis system, with the addition of &quot;Amoral&quot; (which is not available to characters).<br/><br/>Characters accumulate experience points based principally on combat or treasure.  Experience accumulates to certain discreet points at which time the character gains a Level, yielding Character Points which can immediately be spent on Skill ranks.<br/><br/>The Action Resolution system in the game uses a universal chart for everything.  A difficulty class, or Necessary Skill Roll, is determined and a character rolls percentile dice and adjust the roll by their Skill Rank.  Rolling under the target yield success.  Rules for automatic failure and automatic success, based on Level, are provided.  Character Resistance Rolls work much like Skill checks, but use a separate table.<br/><br/>Characters gain Action Points which may be expended during combat to influence outcomes.

One player is selected to play the Empress, an exceptionally cruel and all-powerful despot.  The remaining players play courtiers.  Courtiers have only two game characteristics--a name, and a favor to beg from the empress.  Sample names and favors are provided--favors, for example:  tax exemptions, favorable marriage for child, local monopoly, additional lands or titles, etc.<br/><br/>The Empress opens court and makes a request of some entertainment or activity to be provided by the courtiers.  Courtiers then take turns presenting themselves and begging their favor.  The Empress may engage in conversation with the Courtier, but does not have to do so.  After some point the Empress either sends the Courtier away to death, banishes them, or speaks to the next courtier.  This cycle continues until only a single courtier remains present at which time that player has won the round and accumulates points.  Play proceeds to the next round where the next player is the Empress and the former empress is now a courtier.  At the end of several rounds, the player with the most points is declared the game's winner.<br/><br/>The rules encourage suitable body language and demand first-person voice.  For example, the Empress should sit straight up and speak clearly.  Courtiers should be obsequious and pleading.<br/><br/>"}, "184414": {"rpgdesigner": ["Joseph Carriker", "Brian Dudolevitch"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgseries": ["Mountain Terrors"], "name": "Thunderbird", "rpgartist": ["Hal Mangold", "Mike Vilardi"], "rpgproducer": ["Tom Cadorette", "Hal Mangold"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2672687.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Chronicle System"], "rpgpublisher": ["Green Ronin Publishing"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2672687_t.png", "description": "Publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Sudden mountain storms may rise up out of nowhere, bringing the possibility of flash floods, mud slides, lightning strikes and similar dangers.

Each player leads their own civilization as it tries to expand its culture over a map board that stretches from the Mediterranean Sea to India.<br/> Although battles and territorial strategy are important, Mega Civilization is not a wargame as you might expect when looking at the map board. Instead, the objective of play is to gain a level of overall advancement involving cultural, economic, scientific, political, civic, and religious factors. The player who most effectively balances these various goals will achieve the best scores and win.<br/><br/>In more detail, the objective of Mega Civilization is to acquire the highest number of victory points (VPs) by building cities and developing Civilization Advances. This will be done over various phases and turns, some of which will be performed simultaneously by the players. After each turn, a check is made for each player to move forward on the Archaeological Succession Table (A.S.T.). Each step on this timeline represents a certain period of time in history reaching from the Stone Age. Advancement there will provide even more VPs. The winner will not necessarily be the first player to reach the end of the A.S.T. or the player with the highest number of cities or Civilization Advances, although these are the key factors in determining the winner.<br/><br/>Each civilization begins with a single population token, and every turn each player increases their population by adding tokens to each area they occupy. These tokens can be moved over the map board by land or (using ships) by sea. As each area has a population limit, a good strategic overview will give players advantage in occupying more and more areas. If a player manages to move sufficient tokens into an area, they can build a city there. These cities generate trade cards which will eventually lead to wealth. During trade sessions, players receive not only the commodities they need to complete sets; they might also receive calamities which will remove population or cities. Specific Civilization Advances will protect the players from natural or civic calamities. The development of these Civilization Advances is symbolized by turning in sets of trading goods, as the wealthier civilizations will acquire more Civilization Advances.<br/><br/>As civilizations develop, it will be harder for their rulers to find the right balance between future population growth, maintaining enough support for their cities, and increasing their treasury. If they cannot manage their token population, their cities might eventually revolt during the tax collection phase. The civilizations with the strongest economy traditionally score the highest.<br/><br/>A game of Mega Civilization can take 10-12 hours to complete. Players can also choose to play the beginner scenario &mdash; &quot;The First Game&quot; &mdash; which takes only 1-2 hours. Another scenario &mdash; &quot;The Short Game&quot; &mdash; provides the same excitement as the full game, although the game starts in a later age; by doing this, games can be played in &quot;only&quot; 6-8 hours.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "5", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "8.39599", "name": "Mega Civilization", "playingtime": "720", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Set Collection", "Trading"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "541", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Civilization"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BGA Ep 89 - Gamer FAQ: How Do You Rate Your Games?", "Episode 02: Board Games Are Bullies", "Episode 13: Essen 2015 Wrapup - Worlds Fair Preview - BGG Con, Space Hulk and More!", "Episode 15: Survive: Escape from Atlantis!, Trading Places, and Cardinal Quest", "Episode 21: Above and Below Review - Kevin Wilson Interview", "Episode 28:  HeavyCon 2016 Recap - Jon Gilmour Interview", "Episode 33 - Top 50, Picks 20-11", "Episode 35 - Mega Civilization: Part 1", "Episode 36 - Mega Civilization: Part 2", "Heavy Cardboard Episode 37 \u2013 All the games!", "Heavy Cardboard Episode 52 &ndash; Amanda&rsquo;s Top 50 &amp; Edward&rsquo;s Top 50", "MOBG podcast 39 This is the Real Deal, Part 2 of Spiel Essen", "What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing Week 52!!!

While the title character will be able to become the leader of the Huns, he is not yet in power at the start of the campaign.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Campaign<br/><br/>The campaign map for Total War: Attila spans from Bactria to Lusitania and from Caledonia to Garamantia in the Sahara. Provinces are groupings of three regions, and each region within a province can be conquered separately. The number of cities and regions is different from Total War: Rome II, but the size of the map is similar. The map of Total War: Attila further extends into modern day Russia in lieu of the eastern provinces of the Hindu Kush found in Total War: Rome II, shifting the player's attention to the nomadic Huns. The largest settlement in a province is designated as the province capital. These province capitals have more building slots than the other settlements and are also walled at the start of the game, though in a change from Rome II the small settlements can eventually be upgraded to have walls.<br/><br/>The game focuses on the latter stages of the Roman Empire after its split in 395 A.D. upon the death of Emperor Theodosius I with his sons each ruling a half: Honorius in the West, and Arcadius in the east. Since the days of Diocletian it has become a custom to divide Rome as the pressures to govern the empire have become too much for a single emperor to handle. With the split of the empire both sides face multiple threats on all sides, including internal instability undermining each of the young emperors control as part of the long term repercussions of the Third-Century Crisis. When the game begins, playing as the Western Roman Empire gamers will face waves of hordes entering their borders as the arrival of the Huns in the east have caused them to flee in search for new homes. Since the death of Emperor Valentinian I and the division of the empire, the weaknesses in the West have rapidly begun to show and edge the empire closer to ruin. With depleted funds from centuries of internal mismanagement, the West is unable to muster an effective army to combat the invaders. The Eastern Roman Empire, with its new capital in Constantinople as the gateway for trade between Europe and Asia along with administrative reforms have turned it into an economic powerhouse in the game. Yet the Eastern Romans face an initial threat from the Visigoths hovering in Greece, able to even make a direct assault on Constantinople itself, and remain wary of the Sassanid threat in the east. If chosen to play either of the Roman empires, gamers will be tasked with saving and preserving the once-great empire, and if possible unite Rome under a single emperor.<br/><br/>As &quot;Total War: Attila&quot; embraces an era of great change with the peoples of Europe migrating across the campaign map, Attila adds a new dimension in the form of a faction's religious conversion in the game that brings an array of unique benefits across the player's empire depending on the religion that they choose to favour. The presence of a faction's state religion offers bonuses, including provincial edicts assigned, temple buildings, churches, and even character traits. These factors all play an important role in how dominant the player's religion is over a province. If a province has a population with several religions it can have a negative affect on public order and thus lead to revolts. Factions also suffer or gain religious penalties when engaging in diplomacy with each other depending on their chosen religious affinity. Should the player choose to convert to a new religion, their faction's overall population must have at least 35% of that religion to convert. To find which religion is dominant in a region the campaign map may be searched using the religion filter provided. For players who choose Christianity as their state religion, the five cities of Rome, Constantinople, Aelia Capitolina, Antioch, and Alexandria that formed part of the Pentarchy have the exclusive option for their churches to be upgraded to &quot;Holy See&quot; status, which comes with major bonuses. The game includes a total of 13 religions available throughout the campaign map, although the effects of minor religions are not fully understood.<br/><br/>Based on historical accounts, a mini Ice Age in this period plays a part for the peoples of Northern Europe to move to the more fertile south as the winter cold moves further down and engulfs Europe in longer winters as the game progresses. As an added new feature included in Attila, the Fertility of a region plays a crucial part when settling in a region if playing as a migrating horde or creating important buildings that deliver food throughout your empire. The campaign map is divided on various fertility levels that are color-coded and labeled; from highest-lowest: Rich, Good, Average, Poor, Meagre, Infertile. The greater the fertility level, the greater the amount of food can be cultivated with the appropriate buildings. However, the amount of food harvested is affected by a number of various external and internal factors. These include: building consumption costs, razed areas within your controlled province, provincial edicts, character traits, foreign armies raiding within your borders.<br/><br/>The game features 56 factions, 40 of which are unplayable. each with their own unit roster and agenda. Ten factions are playable in the game at launch, with others added via downloadable content (DLC) packs.<br/>Playable Factions<br/><br/>* The Huns<br/>   * Eastern Roman Empire<br/>   * Visigoths<br/>   * Vandals<br/>   * Ostrogoths<br/>   * Saxons<br/>   * Franks<br/>   * Western Roman Empire<br/>   * Alans<br/>   * Sassanid Empire<br/>   * Suebi<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Total War: Attila&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "184457": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Hiroshi Kawase"], "average": "6", "poll": [], "name": "Jet Fighter", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "yearpublished": "1986", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2682577_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Yoshiyuki Takani"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Tsukuda Hobby / Original"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2682577.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Aviation / Flight", "Modern Warfare"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "The game of jet fighters air combat in the imaginary battle.<br/><br/>There are 28 different jets (US, USSR, GB, FR, JAP, etc...) each detailed on a separate card with its vital statistics.<br/>It seems quite close to Air Superiority.<br/><br/>This game use simultaneous movement like those used in the SPI games.<br/><br/>Components :<br/><br/>- 8 maps;<br/>- 1 rules manual;<br/>- 2 sheets about missiles;<br/>- 2 sheets of charts and tables;<br/>- 580 counters;<br/>- 1 Simultaneous Movement pad;<br/>- 2 six sided dice<br/><br/>"}, "184458": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2677485.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Charles Ward"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Vicente Sivera Catal\u00e1", "Bruno Cerkvenik", "Steven Tu"], "boardgamepublisher": ["EX1ST GAMES"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2677485_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Deduction", "Negotiation"], "description": "Blood &amp; Fortune is a tense, competitive card game of negotiation, deduction, and betrayal.

By modifying dice rolls, players puzzle out which processes produce gold. Whoever can get the most gold at the least cost is the winner.<br/><br/>In more detail, Alchemidus is a speed puzzle, with players trying to be the fastest to find the cheapest way to convert clay to gold.<br/><br/>The game has four pairs of d6 dice, in gold, lead, clay and white to show the process. The 2 gold and clay dice, and 1 of the lead dice are rolled and placed on their respective marker cards. The players must figure how to progress from the two clay numbers, to the one lead number, and then back to the two gold numbers.<br/><br/>To do this, there are three rows of five cards dealt out from three small decks. One row has spells to remove a die, so you need that to go from clay to lead. Likewise, another row is spells to add a die, so you need that to go from lead to gold. The third row is to modify dice values. The spells are varied and often symmetrical, so you might have one spell saying &quot;If the total is &gt;=7, do...&quot; and another saying &quot;If the total is &lt;=7, do...&quot;, or a spell for odd numbered dice, and another for even numbers.<br/><br/>Each spell card has a number on it, the cost of using that spell. The numbers go from 0 to 5 with five cards being 10 and one being 20 (Get any value die). Players must read the spells and quickly figure out the lowest cost method of going from clay to gold. It should always be possible, the spells have sufficient variety and there's enough of them.<br/><br/>When one player declares a cost, the others have a little time to declare a lower cost. The player that proves the lowest formula wins the round.<br/><br/>The game is well made, the dice and card stock are good quality. The game comes with Japanese rules only but the spell cards are all in English mainly, with notes in Japanese.

It retains a single game mechanic throughout most of its functions.  A design goal was to limit the mathematics involved during play.  Cychosys does not use &quot;hit points&quot; to track damage to characters.<br/><br/>Character creation is flexible but also quite complex.  Characters start with 80-100 experience points which are then spent during character creation.  Characters first spend points to buy &quot;Levels&quot; in Skills and Finesse.  Next, Tricks, Weapons, and Equipment are purchased.  Finally, a character purchases Trademarks.  Based on the final version, another round of modifications may be needed, as well as numerous computations to generate the characters statistics.<br/><br/>The core mechanic divides all tasks into seven categories (Trivial, Simple, Average, Tough, Remarkable, Fantastic, Legendary) and assigns a score, 1-100, to the task.  Resolution is determined by 1d12 plus possible modifier.  The 1d12 roll is interpreted in a non-standard way, however, with both 11 and 12 counting as zero but 11 signalling success (a &quot;surge&quot;) and twelve signalling failure (a &quot;crash&quot;).  In both cases the character earns an experience point.  A roll of 1 is called a &quot;nit&quot; but otherwise is used as normal.<br/><br/>During combat characters sustain injury to one of three Facets (Physical, Mental, Emotional) using a mechanism called &quot;Hit Pools&quot; and &quot;Fatigue Pools&quot;.  Hit and Fatigue Pools are fairly complex to generate, taking input from several character aspects.  Sustaining damage will result in reduced performance in a specified Facet according to a Wounding Effects List.  While a design goal was to avoid Hit Points, the replacement system is functionally similar and simultaneously very complicated, if nuanced.  Roughly half of the character sheet is set aside for Hit Pool tracking.<br/><br/>The Cychosys Manual is presented as an HTML document with an Introduction and ten Chapters and a Character Sheet.  Note that Chapter 10 was never completed.  A basic Character Sheet is provided, and at one time an internet support forum existed.<br/><br/>"}, "184466": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Tetsuya Iida"], "poll": [], "name": "Cat's Party", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "6", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Animals: Cats"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2673507_t.png", "average": "5.16667", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Yamato Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2673507.png", "boardgameversion": ["Japanese first edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "User Summary:<br/>Cat's Party is a card-drafting game where each player holds their own party and tries to invite cats.

The player controls the swarmites as a collective, but each swarmite has individual intelligence meaning interaction between the player and the swarm is always dynamic.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Swarm (2011 video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "184480": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2678750.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Pete Shelling", "Bill Sisler"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "0", "boardgamepublisher": ["Multi-Man Publishing"], "maxplaytime": "180", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2678750_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>Action Pack #12: ASL Oktoberfest XXX is a celebration of the 30th running of ASL Oktoberfest in Greater Cleveland, Ohio.

Die rolls usually are modified by an affective attribute and the result will modify a reactive attribute.<br/><br/>All attributes are generated using a random process.

Initiative ranges from -3 to 6.<br/><br/>The core mechanic involves rolling 2d6, adding the relavent Affective attribute, and comparing the result to a Success Level, meeting or exceeding the level indicates success.

One of the core differences from the game of its homage, is the main issue of having entirely symmetrical playable factions remade into asymmetrical ones. The four factions in the game are fighting for control of the large deposits of Chaos Stones, the namesake of the game, in a moon at the centre of the galaxy.<br/><br/>Each have different methods of engaging the enemy, with The Civilisation of Humanity boasting superior technology and the ability to promote your ordinary troops into higher elite ranks, maintaining its theme of being focussed on defence, as reflected in its regard for the maintenance of the precious lives of humans, as part of the enlightened doctrine that represents the utopian ideas of this advanced Civilisation of the future.<br/><br/>The second faction in the line-up is The Animagusi Coven, a very powerful sect of spellcasters who are adept at wielding magical powers, for which they use the potent concentrate of energy held within the Chaos Stones as fuel for these spells, to commit feats that even the Science of the technologically advanced Humans can barely achieve, for which they have resided in secret within the laws of their society, hidden from knowledge. They are arguably the most interesting of the factions to play, not to mention challenging and the most complex, given your need to manage two decks consisting of either Energetic State Cards, that determine the success rate of spells, or Magical Element Cards, for which are used in combinations in order to synthesise the various magical spells that form their arsenal, to destroy the enemy. Biologically speaking though, they are just a different group of humans with separate goals, but the focus of all factions is eventually the seizing of complete control of the moon that contains these precious Chaos Stones. The Animagusi actually take their names from the shapeshifting powers of their original members, able to transform into different animal forms.<br/><br/>The third faction in this sequence is called The Evolved Bionids. As the name suggests, they have characteristics that puts them in similar categories to the Zerg of StarCraft, or the Tyranids of Warhammer 40,000. They are a very interesting race that is focussed on the macromanagement aspects of a board game, centrally about managing your economy to produce and upgrade your Strains in huge and various amounts, and have the most diversified and myriad of all unit choices, given each Base Strain can be mutated into two Divergent Strains, with distinct and separate utility between their abilities, although you are not restricted from morphing both. The Bionids in fact have management of a secondary resource, as an emphasis of their distinct playstyle focussed around fuelling the pump of this living engine of war, to outproduce and overrun by sheer production of numbers.<br/><br/>The fourth and last, although designed second in order, is The Great Rhuds, the natural residents of this moon that is being contested over. And this moon, which we can call the Lunalode, is prized over precisely because of the presence of its great wealth of Chaos Stones. These powerful objects have a close symbiotic relationship with the Rhuds, in fact the cause for their sentience in the first place. Being rather primitive and unevolved compared to the other sentient beings in the galaxy, they make up for their lack of formidable technology by relying on the Chaos Stones for power, so in comparison to all other factions, they are the ones to utilise the power of the Chaos Stones and depend on them as a technology to engage on par with the other races, for nearly all their weaponry and warfare. A large focus on the Rhuds, or The Great Rhuds as they refer to themselves, since they are arguably the least advanced, they have a reliance on cheap and numerous troops, the usage of speed and mobility through interconnecting tunnels they can create throughout the board, and the potent yet risky power, presented by Chaos Stone Tech Weapons. The sheer power of the Chaos Stones, of which among the four factions, The Great Rhuds are the only ones to tap most directly into with raw effect, and access its potential in the way that it can ultimately or best achieve, making them the most able users of that particular technology.<br/><br/>If you read the categories and mechanics that the game falls under, you will realise it is an ambitious synthesis of many elements, some inspired and taken from other board games, into a complex and elegant whole. How the factions almost have their own mini-game within the mechanics of how they play, and the focus of each separate mechanic makes for very different playing experiences, and differing tactical and strategic approaches to winning the game.<br/><br/>Above all else, to know how the game is like, it is best experienced and played. It is my belief you will enjoy it, and with your support, you can expect the possibility for two expansions already planned.<br/><br/>"}, "184494": {"poll": [], "name": "Bite Nite", "playingtime": "75", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Deck / Pool Building"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Vampires"], "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3233648_t.jpg", "average": "9", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["4TIPS"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3233648.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Kickstarter edition"], "maxplaytime": "75", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Bite Nite is a new tabletop game about competition and supremacy among vampires.

If you're not familiar with the concept, technical debt is the drag on productivity that sloppy coding and testing create. Teams sometimes have to take shortcuts, but they pay the price, in the long term. Here's where to get it: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.game-change-llc.com/diceofdebt/' rel='nofollow'>http://www.game-change-llc.com/diceofdebt/</a><br/><br/>Teams often have a hard time justifying to their management, or to themselves, the investment needed to reduce technical debt. Fixing the existing code, or implementing practices that improve the quality of future code, have a cost. Under time pressures, and with an unclear picture of how much of a drag on productivity technical debt really is, teams are hesitant to make a hard choice, even if it increases the amount of software value that the team will eventually deliver.<br/><br/>The game simulates the work of an Agile software team over the course of 10 sprints. (If you're not familiar with Agile, or sprints, just suffice it to say that we're talking about the work that a team can get done in a series of 10 2-week intervals.) The 12 dice used in the game represent the team's capacity, which is split between coding new features and dealing with the burden of technical debt. You roll one set of dice to represent the value of the new features, then subtract the total from the roll of another set of dice to represent the burden of technical debt.<br/><br/>The players (working cooperatively, since they're the team) can decide to implement measures that will reduce technical debt. Either the pool of technical debt dice will get smaller, or you will subtract from the final result of rolling these dice. You have to set aside some time and effort to implement these technical debt-reducing measures, so your capacity for coding new features will drop temporarily.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to produce the largest amount of new software value (features) by the end of the game (again, 10 turns, representing &quot;sprints&quot;). There's no specific &quot;win&quot; condition, other than to see how much better you can do, in the end, than if you had taken no action to reduce technical debt.<br/><br/>The real victory the players can achieve is a good conversation about what they might do, in their own work on software teams, to reduce technical debt. Now that they've seen the long-term productivity gain they can achieve from a short-term productivity loss, it will become easier to justify the difficult choices.<br/><br/>The game is not designed to provide an extremely accurate simulation of the benefits that each technical debt-reducing measure might provide. However, it does simulate other aspects of decision-making about technical debt. For example, the players can see how important it is to invest earlier rather than later in reducing technical debt. In these ways, the game also provides simulation value.<br/><br/>Dice Of Debt is going to be part of a package of materials that the Agile Alliance is producing to help people combat technical debt. We will post more specifics when we have them. The current plan is to publish this package by the end of 2015.<br/><br/>"}, "184038": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1427653.jpg", "poll": [], "statistics": [], "boardgamecompilation": ["PAX: Nocturnus", "Pergamemnon: Antebellum"], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "5", "age": "10", "boardgamepublisher": ["Irongames"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1427653_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Ancient", "Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Mythology"], "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>PAX Expansion: the slaves are re-arming themselves and Rome, too, does not remain idle.

The Self-Esteem Game is a roll-and-move board game where players attempt to earn money by praising other players and building their self-esteem.  Players roll a die to move on a track, landing on various letters along the way.  When they land on a letter, they must use three (or four or five, depending on the level chosen) positive words describing the player to their left or right in sentences, within 30 seconds.  If they are able to do so, they earn an amount of money that corresponds to the difficulty of the letter (for example Y and U earn $1000, A and S earn $300).  One player is The Negotiator, a sort of gamemaster.  Players who are unable to think of enough words can buy a word from the negotiator (who has a book of suggested words) for half the value of the letter space.  The Negotiator also controls the money and the timer.<br/><br/>Players may not repeat words that have already been used.  Other players may challenge a word used by a player as being incorrect or not positive.  If the challenge is successful, the challenger gets double the value of the letter.  If the challenge fails, the original player gets double value.  The rules specify that a dictionary should be consulted by the Negotiator.  There are also &quot;self-esteem&quot; space where players draw a card which describes an effect of high or low self-esteem.  These cards either give extra money to the player or cause a penalty to be paid.  If a player must pay a penalty and has too little money, he or she must get a loan from The Negotiator, which must be paid back plus 10% interest.<br/><br/>Game play continues for 30 minutes.

Characters distribute eleven points among six attributes (Scout, Move, Keep, Special X, Special Y, and Talk), with each score ranging from one to three.  Perhaps the most significant attribute is Talk, giving characters five vocabulary words per point (e.g., five to fifteen words).  The Talk score also determines how many words can be strung together in a sentence or understood when listening (e.g., one to three).<br/><br/>In play, characters are able to do only those things the player can express using the characters' limited vocabulary.  Each character does get some &quot;free&quot; vocabulary words, however:  their name, &quot;Ugh!&quot;, &quot;Eh?&quot;, and &quot;Uhm...&quot;, and &quot;Yaaaa!&quot;.  Sign language (mimicry, gestures, body language) may also be used when words fail.<br/><br/>All characters elect the Barbarguden, or leader.  The Barbarguden takes the role of Game Master, making all decisions that need to be made.  Barbarians come from the land of Hau and adventure into the land of Bort (the rest of the world).<br/><br/>The core mechanic for all opposed or non-trivial actions is a die roll.  Characters attempt to roll d6 under the appropriate attribute.  The Barbarguden can determine (generally, before rolling--but after rolling if sufficiently bribed) whether the dice result should be modified.<br/><br/>Characters do not advance during play, but there are four goals shared by all barbarians:<br/>1- Make friends with some other barbarians,<br/>2- Become King of the Hauenstein (King of Hau)<br/>3- Go somewhere else<br/>4- Other stuff<br/><br/>"}, "184166": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Josep M.

Have you ever GM&rsquo;d for a player who always seemed to want to wander off into the woods (or the merchant district) in search of rare and exotic reagents and compounds for his next magical experiment, and struggled to come up with an exciting and suitably fantastic material for him to find?<br/><br/>Then this is the book for you. Successor to the critically-acclaimed A Necromancer&rsquo;s Grimoire: The Secret of Herbs and A Necromancer&rsquo;s Grimoire: Herbs of the Jungle, A Necromancer's Grimoire: Herbs of the Desert continues its predecessors' unique approach to the sorts of low-cost special substances that can be created with the Craft (alchemy) skill. Presented herein are ten new desert-themed herbs with very special properties, as well as everything you need to know about how to use them in your game.<br/><br/>Take for example the clinging fire plant. A parasitic herb, clinging fire is a bright red mass of needle-like webbing that grows beneath the skin of plants and animals, and is one of the few herbs that may wind up harvesting you, instead! Those brave enough to gather a few doses might use them to make a clinging fire bomb, a nasty splash weapon that exposes those it hits to the herb's spores, possibly infecting them with the parasite. Alternatively, it can be used to make the sickness siphon, an auto-immune booster that helps the body fight off diseases and infections using the dead clinging fire pathogen as a decoy.<br/><br/>Or perhaps you prefer the walking cactus, a monstrous plant that lives up to its name, and is the only herb that can truly fight back. These creatures may be monsters (with full stat-blocks for standard, giant, and deadly walking cactuses), but they're also herbs, and harvesting doses from slain walking cactuses can grant the ability to craft potent thorn armor, which damages those who attack you, cactus drool, a nasty acidic substance, or reinvigoration serum, a powerful curative, all of which are more effective the larger the walking cactus that they were harvested from.<br/><br/>Other highlights include berries that can render you invisible for a short time, poisons that are resistant to magical healing, numerous different perfumes, all of which enhance one's interpersonal skills in subtly different ways, and a very potent elixir that offers a permanent one-time increase to the imbiber's caster level.<br/><br/>By themselves, each herb can be specially prepared into a handful of different special substances called preparations with a successful check, and further information outlines additional compounds and poisons that can be created by mixing two of these herbs together, for a total of over 70 new special substances and poisons.<br/><br/>Also included are guidelines for foraging and preparing these herbs, as well as optional rules for cultivating herbs deliberately and identifying the properties of unknown herbs, and many of the herbs in this book have special properties even without any special preparation. Whether you want to make the best alchemist (or witch, or hedgewizard, or even druid or ranger) ever, and display your superior knowledge of special plants, or just want to make sure that your players never look at a flower stand the same way ever again, don&rsquo;t pass this book up.<br/><br/>"}, "184199": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2694077.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1992", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Parker Brothers"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2694077_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "description": "The object of the game is to be the first player to explore and mess up the objects given to you at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>In a two player game, each character must mess up 6 objects to win.

Characters have multiple attributes (intelligence, wisdom, constitution, strength, dexterity, speech, appearance, art, ethics, faith, etc.), some of which are scored by distributing a pool of 60 points, and some of which are randomized.  Secondary traits (class, gender, race, size, horoscope, social status, etc.) are either selected or generated based on attributes or random rolls.<br/><br/>Skills are then selected with skills being accessed via skill clusters, available only to some classes.  Skills are further distinguished by the cluster which granted access and by the method of study yielding proficiency in the skill.<br/><br/>Spells (magic or miracles) are categorized into several casting methods and are created through a specific spell skill (of which there are nine, roughly aligning with &quot;schools of magic&quot;).  Each spell skill grants tentative access to an exclusive spell list.  Spells are assigned a difficulty depending on effect, as well as a fatigue value for depleting character spell power.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved with the aid of a large array of matrices, each one devoted to weapons of a similar type (e.g., heavy impact weapons, light piercing weapons, etc.), cross-indexed with opponent's armor class to yield both &quot;to hit&quot; modifiers and damage ranges.

Characters have only one type of statistic, called a Trait.  Traits represent things like skills, professions, or talents.  Sample traits would be:  hacking, fortune telling, investigator, assassin, clever, strong, or vicious).  Characters can have multiple traits with score ranging from 1 to 5 (2 is considered &quot;normal&quot;).  Characters also have a &quot;trump&quot; suit, representing their best type of traits.  Optionally, characters have &quot;karma&quot; points that allow narrative revision when expended (a type of &quot;safety net&quot;).<br/><br/>During resolution, each opponent identifies a relevant trait and draws a number of cards corresponding to that trait.  A card is then played (or a set or a straight, if drawn) and the opponent must counter each card by beating it.  Sets give &quot;Slams&quot; and straights give &quot;Combos&quot;, both yielding excellent results.<br/><br/>Aside from the mechanics, the site also provides a list of adventure hooks, an assortment of &quot;goons&quot; to thwart the players, a character sheet, an example of play, and an optional system of talents and flaws.

The goal is to travel star systems in distant galaxies and bring home discoveries in the form of knowledge, exolife, exosubstances, and Zero-G product items. The more you bring home and the more variety there is in what you bring home, the more glory you receive. Whoever has the most glory wins.<br/><br/>The prototype-grade warp drive in your mothership is effective but hard to steer, making you part explorer and part test pilot on your brave journey into the unknown. You all travel by jumping between galaxies together in a convoy that's connected to a mothership where the warp drive is. About nine months elapse on each star system visited, separated into three turns. In each star system, you travel individually and compete to make discoveries that generate glory. At the end of the year at each star system, the warp drive tries to jump back to earth. If it is successful, the game ends and you make the final scoring; otherwise you spend about three months warp-travelling and end up in another star system, where you collect more discoveries.<br/><br/>"}, "184248": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2727293.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Valerio Aversa", "Luca Moscatelli", "Francesco Orioli", "Germano Preite", "Micol Raggi"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Clara Mingazzini"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Deus Games"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2727293_t.png", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Card Game", "Fighting", "Humor", "Party Game"], "description": "Sheep Happens is a look into a ridiculous world where incredibly dumb sheep will have to figure out how to save themselves from the angriest, craziest, and most bizarre goats you've ever seen.

The player can choose to start with a pole or a ball. Each player plays their turn using only one item at a time: a pole or a ball.<br/>Every piece played must be linked to the pieces played beforehand. As the poles are inserted in the ball holes a three dimensional figure will begin to form.

The players build up a three-dimensional network where there are different diagonals (2D or 3D) that allow placing 4 balls of the same colour in line. The game is considered a draw when both players use up their pieces and no player can place 3 poles more than their opponent into a ball or 4 balls of the same colour in line.

Players have to manage a portfolio of stocks, properties and bonds, and assess the risk-reward of holding them in different allocations.

In 2025 the first settlers arrived on Mars! The first small colonies were developed and 10 years later a group of very powerful space exploration companies established a major colony ruled by a terrestrial organization. The OMDE (Organization for Mars Development and Exploration).<br/><br/>2. The currency for this colonies was not established yet but the most usual and valuable currency was a kind of condensed energy called Power Cells.<br/><br/>3. As an astronaut from a private space exploration company, you want to be the pioneer in developing the most advanced and biggest colony on Mars, achieving the OMDE goals as well as your company hidden agenda.<br/><br/>4. By providing and managing settlers you will explore, mine, build, power and upgrade buildings.<br/><br/>5. You will lead the construction and assembling of farm domes, water compounds and power generators.<br/><br/>6. You will build and develop Rovers and Spaceships to mine Mars moons and the asteroid belt. This will grant you the precious Ore needed to build and improve your colony.<br/><br/>7. Trade or buy in small black-markets both locally and on Earth.<br/><br/>8. And finally become auto-sufficient and free from any terrestrial organization.<br/><br/>Do you dare to be part of mankind&rsquo;s next biggest conquest?<br/>Grab yourself a piece of it.<br/><br/>The game starts with a small colony and a few buildings already built, like the O2 factory, shelters, a generator, a farm and a water compound.<br/><br/>The game is played in turns using different phases:<br/>Players decide which OMDE goals will be part of the game, how the new settlers from earth will be distributed through the different colonies and which community buildings and materials Earth needs to authorize and provide.<br/><br/>Players dispute with each other a limited set of actions they can take in their turn and the raw materials sent from Earth.<br/>In turn order players take the actions, but they need careful planning, builds consume power and a second building may not be placed before a generator is upgraded.<br/><br/>Finally, all the Colony parameters are adjusted.<br/><br/>An auction will decide the paths of the players in game. The goals in play are different in every game as such the strategies pursued by players will also necessarily have to be different.<br/><br/>Actions may be: to build/upgrade buildings, rovers or ships, to produce, to trade, to explore, to develop.<br/>Actions have the form of cards to upgrade buildings, tokens, tiles or just the adjustment of a cube.<br/><br/>All actions have an energy cost, so upgrading the generators and the existent power grid is very important. At the same time most of the buildings need Ore to be built, energy, people and O2 to run. Settlers need food, water and shelter to be able to survive.<br/><br/>Food, water and O2 needs to be stored. If you can't store enough supplies, population will not grow and eventually die.<br/><br/>The game can be played with different goals varying the time of play from 60 min (beginner) to 180 min (experts).<br/><br/>"}, "184268": {"rpgdesigner": ["Darwin Leary"], "rpg": ["Darkly Through the Labyrinth"], "statistics": [], "name": "Darkly Through the Labyrinth", "rpgartist": ["Jeff Ward"], "rpgproducer": ["Keith Curtis", "Anita Hager"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2673661.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Softcover"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Crime (Criminal / Law Enforcement)", "Occult"], "rpgpublisher": ["Abstract Nova Entertainment"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2673661_t.png", "description": "(publisher blurb)<br/><br/>In the 1980s, a moral panic swept the United States.

The devil was everywhere and something needed to be done.

Characters may chose to specialize in non-combat skills, one of which allows spellcasting.<br/><br/>Non-combat contested actions are resolved by adding attribute plus skill plus die roll and comparing that to a target difficulty.

The game features the gameplay of the Total War series with factions of Games Workshop's Warhammer series. It is the 10th title in the Total War series and is the first title to be released in the Total War: Warhammer trilogy.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Total War: Warhammer is a turn-based strategy game with real-time tactical battles between armies. Unlike its predecessors, which feature historical settings, Warhammer introduces a fantasy setting as well as characters from the Warhammer universe. These characters, which include monsters, warriors, and heroes, can be controlled by the player. The game also features four playable factions at launch, which are the Empire, the Greenskins, the Dwarfs and the Vampire Counts. The Chaos faction is also available free to those who pre-order or purchase in the first week of release and subsequently available as downloadable content (DLC).<br/><br/>Each faction has access to their own unique units. For instance, the Greenskins faction features units such as Trolls, Giants and Arachnarok spiders. The Empire is a human faction, which features units like Steam Tanks. Each faction has their own unique campaign element. For example, a &quot;Waaagh&quot; system, which pushes the player to be constantly on the warpath, is unique to the Greenskins faction. A new quest mode featuring battles such as the &quot;The Battle of Blackfire Pass&quot; tasks players to complete missions and battles to receive unlockable items and abilities, is one of the new game modes offered in Warhammer. Flying creatures, such as dragons, also make appearances in the game. The campaign map is somewhat similar to the one in Attila with the exception being the diversity in physical terrain and climate as one moves from a particular point in the map to another. The campaign map spans from the Chaos wastes in the north to the Greenskin-infested badlands in the south and from the Great Ocean in the west to the Dwarven realms in the World's Edge mountains to the east. Magic is also one of the elements introduced in Warhammer with most of the factions such as the Empire and Vampire Counts having access to the various lores of magic and certain factions such as the Dwarfs and some non-Playable AI controlled factions having absolutely none or limited access to magic.<br/><br/>Unlike other Total War games, agents are featured in battles as well as the campaign map. Named agents can get injured in battles, while the unnamed ones could be killed and cannot be revived and used again. Total War: Warhammer features a wider variety of animations. For example, 30 types of different skeletons and body types are introduced in the game, instead of only five to six types as in its predecessors, as well as flying units. Other gameplay features from the Total War series, such as city-building, diplomacy and unit-building, remain unchanged in Warhammer.<br/><br/>Corruption is also featured in the game, although somewhat altered as it will be more of an external element caused by the presence of Vampire Count and Chaos armies rather than internal factors<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Total War: Warhammer&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "184314": {"rpgartist": ["Jeremy Mohler", "Paul Wolfe"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Bug Hunt", "rpgdesigner": ["Paul Wolfe"], "rpgproducer": ["Paul Wolfe"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2671219.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Space Opera)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Mystic Bull Games"], "rpg": ["White Star"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2671219_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>By Order of the Oberfuhrer!<br/><br/>All weltkriegsmarine are called to the planet formerly known as Churchill IV to exterminate invasive fauna introduced to the planet to quell dissidents.
