Players continue to move along their supply route, using the marketplace to trade tools and food as well as recruit workers.<br/><br/>The players have to decide how their wood will be transported to their lumberyards (by raft, by foot, or in the winter by sled), if the wood should be dried or be processed immediately, and when the wood should be sold. The player must also think about new acquisitions (such as saws, sleds and pasture land) and fulfill orders to sell the wood.

Four-sided, six-, eight-, tens-, even the dreaded twelve-siders... it didn't matter, so long as there was something to win or lose. Tomrick's problem came when his magical talents emerged. Suddenly, the dice had never thrown so well. Suspiciously well, in fact, and poor Tomrick's gambling days had come to an end. But all was not lost. After long study and many thousands of games played at the University's Causality Tower, Tomrick has emerged as the foremost Diceomantic authority in Arcadia (and gained a near encyclopedic knowledge of every game of chance known to mankind). No longer is Tomrick's good fortune restricted to just rolling dice. Why, his Grand Unified Gaming Theory posits that every living thing in the entire world is caught up in one great game, and that if you know the rules well enough, then you know just enough to break them in your favor.<br/><br/>The Tomrick expansion was a reward given out during the 2015 Dice Tower Kickstarter.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.63163", "name": "Arcadia Quest: Tomrick", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Modular Board"], "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": ["Arcadia Quest"], "usersrated": "49", "boardgamefamily": ["Anime & Manga", "Arcadia Quest", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "174162": {"poll": [], "name": "Odious Lists", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": ["Paper-and-Pencil"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "18", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "maxplayers": "12", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2582797_t.jpg", "average": "5.66667", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "Odious Gaming Company, LLC."], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2582797.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Mature / Adult", "Party Game", "Word Game"], "age": "18", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "In Odious Lists, players have a limited time to come up with answers to outrageous, irreverent, and offensive prompts... with all answers for a given round starting with the same letter of the alphabet.

Paladins are holy knights that wade into battle armed with sword, shield, and faith. They obediently go wherever they are needed to protect the faith and serve the faithful. They have great martial prowess and potent faith-based powers. In many games, paladins also observe a strict chivalric code while maintaining vows of poverty and chastity.<br/><br/>However, paladins aren't simply the stuff of legends. In actuality, paladins were very real. Following the First Crusade, knights banded together to serve the needs of the faith and the faithful. They lived the life of a monk while simultaneously following the path of a warrior. These warrior-monks formed a highbred of monastic life that was termed Military Orders. The most famous of these orders was the Knights Templar.<br/><br/>Ultimate Knights Templar Guide is a sourcebook for Savage Worlds that delves into the world of the Knights Templar from a historical and in-game aspect. The Knights Templar were the ultimate paladins during the Crusades who fought tooth and nail to reclaim the Holy Land. Their Order was shrouded in conspiracy and all of this results in excellent role-playing opportunities.<br/><br/>Ultimate Knights Templar Guide includes:<br/><br/>    A brief history of the Knights Templar.<br/>    Ranks of Templar knights.<br/>    A listing of grand masters.<br/>    Options for creating Templar characters.<br/>    Gear utilized by the Knights Templar.<br/>    Non-player Characters.<br/>    Templar adventures.<br/>    ... and more!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Ultimate Knights Templar Guide is your source for building Templar knights like those from the Crusades, or building the foundations of an alternate history set in the backdrop of the Crusades and the struggles to reclaim the Holy Land.<br/><br/>"}, "174175": {"rpgdesigner": ["Martin Dougherty"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Among the Trojans", "rpgartist": ["Amy Perret"], "rpgproducer": ["William J.

In &ldquo;Bridges to Nowhere&rdquo;, you are attempting to outwit your opponent and construct the most magnificent bridge. Will you plan for a sturdy long bridge, or maybe take a risk with a shorter multilevel bridge where your points can soar as you reach for great heights? Whatever you do, don't forget to keep an eye on your opponent or you may just hand them the victory.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Bridges to Nowhere&rdquo; is a 10-minute, 2-player micro game of strategic card drafting and bridge building. In 4 quick rounds, Players take turns drafting &quot;bridge cards&quot; which they will use to attach to larger &quot;pillar cards&quot; creating a unique Bridge tableau in front of them. At the end of 4 rounds, the Player whose bridge scores them the most points wins!<br/><br/>No one ever said building a bridge was easy though! The challenge and fun of Bridges to Nowhere is found in trying to plan and build within the very particular guidelines of the game. There are three different types of bridge cards (Truss/Cable/Suspension) and they may never be mixed together in the same bridge. Not only that, each bridge card has a numeric point value listed at the bottom along with two symbols, one on each side. Two cards with the same bridge number can never be placed side by side, AND a single line of adjacent bridge cards can only ascend and/or descend numerically once in a single bridge segment.<br/><br/>The Pillar cards are what you'll need to frame your bridge segments and possibly lay a foundation for a double or even TRIPLE decker bridge(if you've got the nerve). Be careful though, your Pillar cards are a strategic resource. If you don't play them just right you may end up with only a partially finished bridge, and that will cost you!<br/><br/>Oh, but don't forget those symbols! If you can match two of the same symbols side by side in a bridge segment you'll reap big point bonuses. Another way to gain bonuses in the game is by completing Contract cards. These give both players a very specific set of bridge construction goals to try and reach in order to gain a medium or large point boost to their total score.<br/><br/>Bridges to Nowhere is a fun and engaging game that plays as beautifully as it looks. With elegant gameplay that challenges players to keep their wits about them at every draw of a card, Bridges to Nowhere brings fun to the table again and again.<br/><br/>"}, "174244": {"average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Tell Me a Story: Volcano Island", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Storytelling"], "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Tell Me a Story"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2433889_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Alex Barrow"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["eeBoo"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2433889.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "Second Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Card Game", "Children's Game", "Educational"], "age": "3", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "As the 6th set in the Tell Me a Story series, Alex Barrow's cast of characters including monkeys, elephant, tiger and more providing recurring characters, locations and props which encourage linking the cards in endless combinations for fresh, new stories every time it's played.<br/><br/>Instructions are included for various ways to encourage storytelling.

They may be researchers or writers, spreading ideas to the far corners of the world that plant the seeds of change wherever they are heard or read or understood. They may be naturalists and explorers, insightful observers into the world around them as it exists, or they may be forward-thinking futurists and experimenters always pushing the envelope of the possible. Their areas of specialization and study range from ancient history to advanced technology, from clockworks and alchemy to manipulation of fundamental forces like electromagnetism and gravity. Equal parts archivist and tinker, from calm loremasters to raving mad scientists, a genius adapts the knowledge of the past and applies it to new situations and new opportunities for breakthroughs. A genius is a character whose mind is her ultimate weapon and who has never met a problem she could not think her way through. A genius is always thinking, always imagining, always listening, always recording, always planning, and always ready to try something new to demonstrate that the mind itself, not the magic it might wield, is the true path to greatness!<br/><br/>Path of the Genius includes advice on creating a concept for your mythic scholar, scientist, or brilliant battlemind, with half a dozen suggested builds, but the heart of this product is over 70 mythic path abilities tailored specifically for the genius' particular blend of inspired invention and technical expertise. Whether your stranger is a mad scientist or a curious professor, an inventor, tinker, battlemind, or well-rounded polymath, you'll find all manner of abilities designed to analyze the boundaries of possibility in the library or laboratory like genegineer, purging alchemy, and it's alive, or on the battlefield like probable path, lesson learned, and regression to the mean. Your genius can master all forms of information with abilities like perfect polyglot, eidetic research, and sage scholar, and can figure out anything he doesn't already know with elementary deduction, insightful calculus, and this just might work. A genius can be a master of the preindustrial sciences as a technological tinker, engineer, or in clockwork creation, or can plumb through Victorian sciences and future technologies like advanced gunnery, nanite replication, and rapid robotics. Whether your genius has his feet planted in alchemy, algebra, or advanced cybernetics, you'll find a wealth of genius ideas to make your heroes as learned as they are legendary!<br/><br/>"}, "174272": {"rpgartist": ["Frank Hessefort", "Tanya Sangsnit", "Colby Stevenson"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Imperial Heroes: Pregenerated Characters", "rpgdesigner": ["Neil Spicer"], "rpgproducer": ["Elizabeth Courts", "Timothy K.

Backed up by the prodigious strength of its arms and the savage ferocity of its many faces, this makes the Fearstalker a highly efficient hunter and killer of almost any organic creature.<br/><br/>This only makes it harder to control &mdash; for once a master has seen it in action, it is more likely to inspire fear, not just by its pheromones and psychic manipulations, but through the memories of the violence it has committed. Most of the hunters that employ Fearstalkers use emotion-dampening drugs when handling them. Some use robotic fear-suppression prosthetics. Eliminating fear is a necessity when controlling them, and even these tactics are not always enough. Controlling oneself through sheer willpower is certainly not an option. Once fear is eliminated, however, Fearstalkers can be quite docile, and take instruction easily.<br/><br/>The other ability the Fearstalker has that makes it such a fearsome tool is the ability to adapt to hostile environments. It does this so quickly that it can often be deployed on unfamiliar planets without warning. In moments it has acclimatized itself to burning gasses, corrosive winds, and radiation. Of course, the failure of the Xalvorians to conquer the slag miners of Illpath III can, in part, be laid at the feet of Fearstalkers eroded by the planet's insidious chemosphere, but many worlds that destroy unprotected human life do nothing to slow down the Fearstalker.<br/><br/>"}, "174322": {"rpgdesigner": ["Russell Brown"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Elusive Legends: Building Story in Tabletop Roleplaying Games", "rpgartist": ["Joshua Zentner"], "rpgproducer": ["Andrew Brown"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2522166.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Books about Roleplaying Games"], "rpgpublisher": ["Diceless Hero Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Non-Game Book (but RPG Related)", "Non-Rankable Item (item will not show in the rankings)"], "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2522166_t.jpg", "description": "From the product blurb:<br/><br/>Learn to be a good gamemaster by learning how to be a good writer.

Technology and greed rule the old west. Wild West Exodus: Unfinished Business introduces 4 new factions to the game; The Confederate Rebellion, Dark Nation, Golden Army, and The Watchers.<br/><br/>About The Confederate Rebellion:<br/>The Confederate Rebellion army has seen death and destruction ravage their states.  Beaten by the Union during the Civil War, the leaders of the Confederate States of America have abolished slavery and joined forces with all men and women of the South.  Their fight against a stronger and more advanced enemy has ignited a strong love of state and government.  The CSA generals fight side by side with their men and want nothing but the complete destruction of the Union army.  They use surprise assaults and gorilla warfare to even the odds against much more powerful foes.  Their men and women are supplied by Dr. Carpathian Industries allowing access to deadly and corrupt weapons.  Rumors of Voodoo magic and the undead fighting alongside Rebel troops have been whispered about for years.<br/>Wild West Exodus is a Sci-Fi Wild West Miniatures Game set in an alternate history wild west. Strange technologies corrupt the land and death lurks at every corner. RJ-1027, the infamous power source created by Dr. Burson Carpathian is the catalyst behind the constantly escalating arms race between the factions that make up Wild West Exodus.<br/><br/>About Wild West Exodus:<br/>Wild West Exodus is a miniatures game played by 2 to 4 players in control of the faction of their choice.  In the world of WWX, every model has the potential to be a hero or a villain.  The game mechanics and rule set feature exciting game play from the first dice roll.  Each player will be allowed to field a posse of 6 to 60 models or more.  The WWX rules have been designed to allow for scaling of the game to high or low model counts without causing rules issues.<br/><br/>One of the most exciting parts of the Wild West Exodus game mechanic is the reusable influence pool.  The influence pool will give players the option to gamble away a set amount of tokens in return for a reroll of the dice.  Be careful what you gamble on because once the tokens are committed they are lost for that turn.  The D10 system gives the game life and options that round out easily and allow for quick decision making.<br/><br/>The Halo that each model possesses creates an area of assault around the miniature allowing for fast and deadly close combat.  This helps move the game along quickly and gives each fight a more cinematic feel.<br/><br/>Wild West Exodus also benefits from an alternating 1-3 model activation system.  This system lets both players choose the most strategic way of advancing their characters across the battle field.  This means that you never have to wait more than a minute or two before taking control of your own posse for your next activation.<br/><br/>Each posse consists of a structured army list.  All factions will have 1 Boss model, 0 to 4 Underboss models, 0 to 8 Sidekick models, and an endless amount of Hired Hands.  Heavy and Light Support vehicles also make up an army list.<br/><br/>This really gives the gamer the option to field a force led by one mighty general commanding a horde of troops or the complete opposite.<br/><br/>Some gamers may choose to load up on skilled Sidekicks and Underbosses or go heavy on Hired Hands for a true horde army.<br/><br/>No matter what option you take, the world of Wild West Exodus will engulf you in fun and excitement from your very first game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "name": "Wild West Exodus: Unfinished Business \u2013 Confederate Rebellion Faction Bundle", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Variable Player Powers"], "average": "6", "boardgameexpansion": ["Wild West Exodus: Female Dark Council miniature", "Wild West Exodus: H-BOT 44 Mercenary miniature"], "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "174327": {"poll": [], "name": "Naruto Sugoroku", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2007", "boardgameimplementation": ["Mawari-Sugoroku"], "boardgamefamily": ["Anime & Manga"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2436161_t.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "4", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Viz Media"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2436161.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Comic Book / Strip"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Naruto Sugoroku is a roll-and-move game that was included as a tear-out insert in the Shonen Jump Naruto Collector magazine for Winter 2007/2008.

Technology and greed rule the old west. Wild West Exodus: Unfinished Business introduces 4 new factions to the game; The Confederate Rebellion, Dark Nation, Golden Army, and The Watchers.<br/><br/>About The Watchers:<br/>As the portals once again open on earth, mankind has no idea what is coming.  The destructive power of the Watchers will completely strip the land of all living things.  The Watchers use their Alpha leaders to guide and advance their many species of aliens.  Each and every member of the Watchers knows his role in their society and follow orders without question.  As their enemies attempt to stop the Watchers, the Betas drain the life energy from their bodies and transport it to their Alpha leader.  This transforms the Alpha during the course of any battle into an enemy that knows every move you will make before you even make it.  With inhuman weapons and a thirst for human blood, they plan to wipe mankind off the planet once and for all.<br/><br/>About Wild West Exodus:<br/>Wild West Exodus is a miniatures game played by 2 to 4 players in control of the faction of their choice.  In the world of WWX, every model has the potential to be a hero or a villain.  The game mechanics and rule set feature exciting game play from the first dice roll.  Each player will be allowed to field a posse of 6 to 60 models or more.  The WWX rules have been designed to allow for scaling of the game to high or low model counts without causing rules issues.<br/><br/>One of the most exciting parts of the Wild West Exodus game mechanic is the reusable influence pool.  The influence pool will give players the option to gamble away a set amount of tokens in return for a reroll of the dice.  Be careful what you gamble on because once the tokens are committed they are lost for that turn.  The D10 system gives the game life and options that round out easily and allow for quick decision making.<br/><br/>The Halo that each model possesses creates an area of assault around the miniature allowing for fast and deadly close combat.  This helps move the game along quickly and gives each fight a more cinematic feel.<br/><br/>Wild West Exodus also benefits from an alternating 1-3 model activation system.  This system lets both players choose the most strategic way of advancing their characters across the battle field.  This means that you never have to wait more than a minute or two before taking control of your own posse for your next activation.<br/><br/>Each posse consists of a structured army list.

What they call the fountain of youth has now kept them alive for hundreds of years endlessly searching for the source.  Their influence over the Mexican people and robust army has pushed them to the door step of the country&rsquo;s boarder.  The men of the Golden Army know of only one thing.  Fight until dead or until the enemy is destroyed.  This horde faction sends endless supply of men to battle.

On the one hand, there are the aloof aliens who held the world in their hands in all those late night flicks and on the other are all the mean and shortsighted problems that we have no reason to believe are native to our world alone. We peel back the Saucer's aluminum siding to show you what humanity was never meant to see: the real reason why the invasions always fail (it ain't human ingenuity), why redneck colons and eviscerated cattle hold such fascination for supposedly superior intelligences, and what happens when the Saucer fails to land on the White House lawn.<br/><br/>There are three things that set this apart from the vast majority of Fiasco playsets; and if you have a problem with any of them you may want to swap to a more conventional playset filled with lust, understatement, and humans.<br/><br/>1)  We keep things family friendly and generally G rated (an honest G rating, not an Andromeda Strain what-was-the-board-thinking sort of G). In case you didn't notice, most Fiasco playsets are solidly in the R to hard PG range, making them unsuitable for parent/kid groups and some new groups still trying to get comfortable with each other. Having said that, the playset is G but your group's imagina- tions may not be. Your game, your call.<br/><br/>2)  One of the most common pieces of advice for playset developers is to tone it down, that too many extreme options on the tables will lead to an overly intense mush of a game. We ignored all that advice from people smarter than ourselves; this is an absolutely gonzo, over the top, ice cream for dinner experience where each and every one of your choices should be ripe enough with possibilities to fill the Saucer with problems. Go big or go back to Omicron Persei 8.<br/><br/>3)  No one is going to be playing humans. You are going to have to make challenging characters work; how do you play a computer with an addiction to 1970s TV, a cardcarrying robo unionist, a creature that lives as much in the future as the past, or perhaps the Saucer itself? That is for you to figure out but our suggestion is: with gusto.<br/><br/>Power up your viewscope and try to remember where you left the Annihilator Beam;<br/><br/>This is going to be a Fiasco!<br/><br/>"}, "174402": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2038122.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Tide of Iron"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["John Goodenough", "Corey Konieczka", "Christian T.

It is the second edition of Tide of Iron (which was first released by Fantasy Flight Games in 2007).<br/><br/>Tide of Iron: Next Wave and Tide of Iron are essentially the same game. Overall, Tide of Iron: Next Wave is much more informative and organized. The rules are improved with corrected errors which make it better than the rules found in the 2007 edition. Also, a few of the scenarios have been adjusted for better game play. These and other improvements make this edition better than the older edition. Also included in Tide of Iron: Next Wave are some additional and useful items that were later introduced to TOI in some of the game expansions. Because of these differences, the two products have different entries on BoardGameGeek. For more information about the older 2007 version of Tide of Iron, you can Click Here.<br/><br/>Tide of Iron is a game of World War II tactical conflict for two to four players. The components in this base game allow players to simulate the dramatic struggle that took place between American and German forces in Northern Europe during the years 1944 and 1945.<br/><br/>Tide of Iron is a scenario-based game, with the available forces, objectives, map, and victory conditions being set by each given scenario. It features loads of plastic figures, including soldiers, equipment, heavy weapons, and combat vehicles, cards, dice, cardboard markers, and modular game boards that will represent the customizable terrain of this scenario-based wargame.<br/><br/>The twelve double-sided map tiles, plus the dozens of included terrain hexes, allow for limitless potential combinations, and each scenario can be enhanced by special rules, objective markers, troop allotments, and other variations.

As part of the project I intended to add some &lsquo;art&rsquo; or map insets around the edges.  This is the map inset for the Munda region.  You will note that while it follows the larger map image there are several features on it that are not present on the Munda map with the &lsquo;one mile per hex&rsquo; layout.  This is intentional, the idea of the large map is to give a framework with cities and towns and general terrain but to leave room for the villages shown on the inset map as well as small, but significant, terrain features.<br/><br/>As to the inset map, the villages are named from local village names or terrain features, but the hills (aside from Bibilo and Gib) and the two named islands have what you may recognize as fairly normal American last names - why?<br/><br/>I have made no secret of the fact I am using WWII era maps and histories in designing this fantasy campaign, and this particular feature that I encountered in my research was something I could not ignore.  The hills shown lie on the route from Zanana to Munda, the route the US Army advanced along in its effort to take Munda during the New Georgia Campaign.  This campaign was mostly fought by American National Guard units, and between their inexperience and the in-depth Japanese defenses they suffered significant casualties, especially among their leaders.  At a point they took to naming &lsquo;hills&rsquo; &ndash; actually small humps of ground that the Japanese had fortified- for the officers who died taking them.  To quote from the book, &ldquo;Munda Trail&rdquo; by Eric Hammel on the naming of one such hill;<br/><br/>Early in the morning of July 27, the 1st Battalion, 161st, (State of Washington National Guard) descended into the low-lying rain forest in front of O&rsquo;Brien Hill toward the next hill, another nameless hump that would soon bear the name of another fallen Amercian. &hellip;&hellip;  Second Lieutenant Louis Christian was taking a breather alone when he saw his platoon begin to pull back.  As the surprised American riflemen tumbled to the rear to find safe positions from which they could beat off the counterthrust, Christian remained where he was to direct fire from supporting mortars.  A short burst of machine-gun fire found him as he searched for targets, and he died in a pool of blood.  The hill had a name. (page 193)<br/><br/>The terrain on the map named for the following who actually had hills and ridges named for them:<br/><br/>    Bartley Ridge- Second Lieutenant Martin Bartley<br/>    Christian Hill- Second Lieutenant Louis Christian<br/>    O&rsquo;Brien Hill- First Lieutenant Robert O&rsquo;Brien<br/>    Kelly Hill- Second Lieutenant  John Kelly<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Terrain on the map named for guys who died bravely but didn&rsquo;t get a hill named for them:<br/><br/>    Doyle Island- First Lieutenant Neil Doyle<br/>    Allison Hill- Sergeant Earnest Allison<br/>    Heitman Hill- Corporal Marvin Heitman<br/>    Miller Hill- Corporal James Miller<br/>    And finally Scott Island for First Lieutenant Robert Scott, who actually survived! He got separated from his unit and made a solitary advance onto a hill that the Japanese had (temporarily) retreated from, and as Mr. Hammel describes it;<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The hill was American, but only Lieutenant Scott was there to claim it.  And only Scott was there to stand off the counterattack that would have brought the hill back within the Empire of Japan.  Scott cared less about the hill than he did about the future of Robert Scott.  He could not retreat, the Japanese were coming his way firing rifles and hurling hand grenades, and all Scott could do was make his stand.(page 182)<br/><br/>He did and got the Medal of Honor for it.<br/><br/>For more information on the above events and people, please refer to &ldquo;Munda Trail&rdquo; by Eric Hammel, Orion Books, New York, NY, 1989<br/><br/>As to the RPG, the hills in the game will be memorializing warriors who died clearing them of an orc invasion with at least one or two potential adventures in the works on the background material for the island.<br/><br/>"}, "174410": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Season One Gimmicks", "rpgdesigner": ["Nathan D.

Harsh deserts and baking salt flats are commonplace, as are bleak interior plains of cracked badlands in which little moisture forms and rains are too infrequent to allow any form of agriculture. And yet the very size of the realm ensures that there are also a few highly fertile regions, and it was in these, usually at the coast or at the mouth of great rivers, that the mighty cities of the realm were founded.

When Queen Isabella arrived with her defeated band of followers, she feared pursuit and capture more than she feared the harsh conditions of the realm itself. For this reason she encouraged the growth of a new morality, one very distinct from the morals of Pendragon. Sexual freedom was promoted even whilst political freedom was curtailed, and both male and female followers were encouraged to believe that it was their duty to procreate and thus build a newer, stronger and larger body of followers for their Queen.

They entertain us with the daring deeds of colorful heroes and villains. They inspire us to go on adventures of our own and see the world in whole new ways. And they remind us that no matter how dark life gets, there&rsquo;s always hope, always a reason to fight for our dreams. Inspired by the fairytale lore we&rsquo;ve come to love. 12 Realms is a constantly expanding game that offers players the chance to act as fairytale heroes&mdash;everyone from Sinbad to King Arthur to Red Riding Hood, Nutcracker, Snow White, Hansel &amp; Gretel, Pinocchio, Robin Hood and beyond&mdash;facing down villains and interacting with other lively characters and companions. There the players are tasked with leading their beloved heroes through a magical journey full of excitement and danger to save the Realms from the Dark Lords&rsquo; overwhelming hordes. Every hero is represented by a lovingly crafted miniature, already included in the box.<br/> Bedtime Story continues to build on that legacy and brings four new realms: Tang Dynasty, Horrorville, Clockwork Shire and Atlantis. This time Heroes must destroy once and for all the Dark Forces! In Tang Dynasty a god has been born with unlimited power. Player begin their journey from the same realm and they must travel from one land to another but to do that they must destroy the Walls which separate each land. Each Wall has three parts and they can be destroyed by accomplishing different tasks: Find all Artifacts, destroy a Dark Lord or destroy the Black Fortress. When a part of  the Wall is removed, the player who did wins some extra and new Talents: the Green ones. These Talents determine the vulnerability of the player at the end of the game. In each round archers on top of the wall attack and all players lose talents, making the game progressively more difficult! Things will become more challenging... As long as player try to destroy the Wall in a Realm, Invaders take over the rest Active Realms! When you get at the Palace, you must all face the god who born there and then one of you can take that power!<br/><br/>On the other other side of the fairy world, Atlantis is sinking and the flood affects all the rest active Realms. Each time you destroy Invaders the water level rise in more than one Realms and you need more Talents to travel there as for the Invaders, they become more powerful. Save as many people, sacrifice your character and buy some time trying to find the solution and save yourselves. The time is running but in Clockwork Shire there is no time. Pinocchio and Geppetto must work to find all the missing gear wheel and re-activate all the Areas and only then you can attack the Invaders who raid the Realm. Use speed, travel among all the realms and find the correct gear wheel but be careful! Steam Baron will be there and you must face his mechanical skills! Regroup your team, this war is not over yet. A madman is running loose in Horrorville, a doctor who transforms people into beasts. If he transforms them all, you lose, so you must work together and find the cure and then you must find this madman and cure him but he is way to strong!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "7.85714", "name": "12 Realms: Bedtime Story", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Co-operative Play", "Partnerships", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "11", "boardgameexpansion": ["12 Realms: Companions Pack", "12 Realms"], "usersrated": "14", "boardgamefamily": ["12 Realms", "Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Crowdfunding: Spieleschmiede"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BGA Ep. 76 - Listener Feedback, the Return!"]}, "174471": {"poll": [], "name": "Skramplokremala", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!"], "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2437553_t.jpg", "average": "4.05", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Remoundo"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2437553.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Party Game", "Word Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "&Sigma;&kappa;&rho;&alpha;&mu;&pi;&lambda;&omicron;&kappa;&rho;&epsilon;&mu;\u03ac&lambda;&alpha; is a boardgame combination of two word games (scrabble and 'hangman game') creating  a completely new and fun game!<br/><br/><br/>"}, "174474": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2546905.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jos\u00e9 Manuel Astilleros Garc\u00eda-Monge"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Jos\u00e9 Manuel Astilleros Garc\u00eda-Monge", "N\u00e9stor Romeral Andr\u00e9s"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "nestorgames"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2546905_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "description": "DuploHex is a connection game, related to Hex, that includes disc and rings.

Steam Court is a 1&ndash;12 player card game that mixes elements of traditional trick-taking, with character based abilities and victory point win conditions.<br/><br/>Steam Court is a game of Victorian hierarchy where the more powerful your position, the greater your opportunity in the game. You'll want to try and hold onto the throne, but don't play your cards right and you'll end up serving the lousy Tea Boy. Each round, players rotate position at the table, and depending on their seat they gain/lose privileges. Even though the game is stacked in favor of those at the top, the luck of the deal, use of special cards, and player strategy are guaranteed to make it interesting.<br/>  <br/>There are multiple variations on how to play, but the typical game involves four rounds of cards and usually takes around 60 minutes.<br/> The original artwork, intriguing theme, and clever game play will have you ratcheting for the top in Steam Court.<br/><br/>Goal: get rid of the cards in your hand before other players do. There are many strategies you can employ do this, but the most common is to be the controlling player to start the trick. The player who wins the trick starts the next trick. This allows you to decide how many cards of the same number you will play. Then all other players must match the quantity of cards played and also beat the number that is on the cards. For example, if a player lays three 1s, then the next player must lay three cards of a higher number - like three 2s or three 3s. What gives this game an extra dimension are the variable character privileges. Each Engineer is granted a different privilege by their Courtier that can be employed at the beginning of the Quarter or throughout the game. For example, the Duke can lay matching numbered cards instead of having to play higher numbered cards on a set of cards.<br/><br/>End of the Quarter: After everyone's cards have been played the Quarter ends and players re-seat based on the order they went out in (first player out becomes the Queen, and so on). They then gain the privileges of a different character for the next Quarter.<br/><br/>7-12 players: When playing with a large group a new element is added to the game -- a second table full of Renegades. Players who do poorly in the Royal Court are banished to the Renegade table, while the top two engineers at the Renegade Table are promoted to the Royal Court. In Steam Court, anything can happen. The lowest of low can climb to the top, or the Queen&rsquo;s engineer can wind up working for the vagabond.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.15217", "name": "Steam Court", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Trick-taking", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "23", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 22: Kemet Review - Ta-Seti Review"]}, "174493": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2442564.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Anthony Natale"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "3", "boardgameartist": ["Dino Natale"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Nostalgic Big Kid Games"], "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2442564_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "5", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Math"], "description": "Two children have lost control of their pet Monsters.

What does this mean for our intrepid heroes? Will all semblance of civilization fall into disorder and chaos? Will the universe, under the weight of so many simultaneous timelines, implode on itself into a cosmic Big Bang?<br/><br/>Well. Maybe. But for now it means the Alien Registration Center has reset the database and is allowing new registration of all previously registered aliens! That's cold, hard Woolong just out there for the taking, baby!<br/><br/>The Space Dandy: Galactic Deck-Building Game brings the bizarre space-faring antics of the hit anime series seen on ADULT SWIM TOONAMI to the game table. It's similar to other Deck-Builders like Dominion and Ascension&mdash;with an extra helping of phantom space ramen goodness. Each player begins the game with the same rather low-powered starting cards, but through careful play, you can acquire more to expand your options. Which cards you choose to take directly influence the kind of game you play!<br/><br/>Cards can grant new abilities, make it easier to acquire new cards, allow you to take extra turns, or even destroy cards from the game altogether! But the most important cards are the aliens. Not only can they improve your hand just like any other card, they can be played Planetside and directly attack the other Player. Why fiddle around endlessly with your deck when you can stick it to them and mess up their carefully laid plans? That's the Dandy way to play!<br/><br/>Even more importantly, aliens are how you win! When you register aliens, they are removed from play, but you get to score precious, precious Woolong that you need to win the game. But be careful! It can be difficult to decide if an alien is more useful in your hand, on the Planet, or in the Alien Registration Center's bank.<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s not to say the other cards aren&rsquo;t important, too! Effect Cards cannot be registered OR played Planetside, but they let you manipulate the game to your advantage. Sick of that really great card the opponent keeps playing? DESTROY IT! Changed your mind about the card you played Planetside? WARP IT BACK! Keep your opponent&rsquo;s on their toes with your carefully constructed (or hazardously haphazard) deck!<br/><br/>You can also fill out your space crew with other humans (and the occasional robot) that can&rsquo;t be registered as aliens (obviously).

Whether you&rsquo;re trying to get a unit of warriors to move, seeing how effective it&rsquo;s shooting or fighting is, or how well it has defended itself, you&rsquo;ll be using the same dice pool mechanism.  You determine the number of dice to roll and each result of 4+ is a success.  The more successes you roll, the better your units will do, and the more likely you are to win.  Simple!<br/><br/>Of course fighting a good tactical battle, getting your units into advantageous situations, and making effective command decisions will mean you&rsquo;ll be far more likely to win.  Coming up with effective tactics for your chosen army to defeat your opponents is what will take you time to master.<br/><br/>So with Warband&rsquo;s intuitive rules you&rsquo;ll be fighting the battle not the rulebook, and hopefully having a lot of fun into the bargain!<br/><br/>You'll be able to decide which of the fantastic races you'd like to command and then construct your force from the lists provided.  <br/>Warband includes complete army lists for twelve armies, with abilities, options, spell lists, and descriptions including; <br/>Barbarian men, Dark elves, Dragon men, Eldritch vampires, Goblins, High elves, Hill dwarves, Lizardmen, Samurai apes, Taurians, Undead, and Wood elves.  Each army is balanced by being constructed from a fixed 500 point cost.  Powerful units cost more so are rarer.  A typical warband will have 10-12 units, representing an army of maybe 3000 warriors.<br/><br/>Army composition and optional upgrades are highly flexible, allowing you to build the force that best fits your style of play.  If you'd like to command a horde of bison riding barbarians, rampaging minotaurs, skirmishing ghouls, or serried ranks of deadly elven archers then you'll find something to suit you in the Warband rules.  This flexibility means that you should be able to play with your favourite fantasy race in a way that suits your personal style and preferences, while your force still retains a unique and interesting character.<br/><br/>"}, "174024": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Chris McCann"], "poll": [], "name": "Elemental Dice", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "yearpublished": "2005", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2444588_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Minds United Ltd"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2444588.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Elemental dice is inspired by the classical elements of Earth,Water,Fire and Air.

Players should write something wacky, funny, weird, embarrassing, physically demanding or thought-provoking -- the more creative the challenges are, the more fun the game is. After all the discs have a challenge written on them, place them face down discs into cells of the box. Players then take turns bouncing the ping pong off the table and into the box. If you miss - you take a penalty drink, if you hit an empty cell - everybody drinks, but if you bounce the ball into a cell with a disc - that player pulls out the disc and must do whatever is written on the back of the disc. After you&rsquo;ve completed your challenge, keep the disc and pass the ball to the next person. You get one bounce per turn, and the ball is passed clockwise around the table/group. Continue playing until all the discs have been drawn.

Demoludy is a reimplementation of a Reiner Knizia game Gem Dealer. This game is also a sequel to the game Pan tu nie sta\u0142! (which is a Polish version of Great Wall of China).<br/><br/>The mechanics were wrapped into a theme of 70's and 80's in communist countries of eastern Europe. In this game players take a trip from Poland, travelling by popular in that time cars and try to collect a set of items bought in four (out of five) different countries. The countries presented in the game are: GDR (German Democratic Republic), Czechoslovakia, HPR (Hungarian People's Republic), Turkey and USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics).<br/><br/>Every round is an auction. The starting player takes one tile of a chosen color (country) and place it in the middle of the table. She then make a starting bid which has to contain at least one card of a matching color. The next player may present a higher bid or pass. After every bid or pass a player draws one new card from the deck and adds it to her hand. The player who already passed is omitted. The auction continues untill all but one player pass. The winner takes the tile, puts it in his car and starts a new round.<br/><br/>The first player to collect a set of four tile in different colors is the winner.<br/><br/>The game also features advanced rules. In this variant in order to win the players have to collect the four color set of tile with a value of at least 10. There are also action cards which can help to it's owner or mess up with other players' cards.<br/><br/>Demoludy vs Gem Dealer - differences<br/>- In Gem Dealer starting player receives one card less than the others. Every player gets 5 cards at the beginning of Demoludy.<br/>- In Gem Dealer there is a rule that if you lose a bidding contest while using wild card 10, you lose one of your previously gathered gem. There is no such rule in Demoludy.<br/>- There is an advanced variant in Gem Dealer in which you have to gather 5 different gems, while in advanced variant of Demoludy you need 4 different items with a total value of 10 or more.<br/>- There are no action cards in Gem Dealer which are in Demoludy.<br/>- Demoludy also contains the expansion for Pan tu nie sta\u0142!

Cards can path off in any direction, limited only by your table space, but must match connecting symbols.  These symbols also grant one time special actions, some good, some bad.  No matter what one action you choose on your turn (draw, place, take track from back on line) the mine cart always moves one space further.

A large pillar of smoke showed that a bomb had exploded in the Houses of Parliament.

He thinks it will be an easy task that he can do from the comfort of his armchair in the Diogenes Club &mdash; until he is informed of disturbing news; his younger brother Sherlock Holmes, Consulting Detective, has been hired by the boy's parents to prove the innocence of his son, who believes to be a scapegoat of a dark conspiracy.<br/><br/>For the first time, the brightest minds in London face each other. Was the young laborer involved in this terrible attack or he is just a scapegoat for a dark conspiracy?<br/><br/>A game of Holmes: Sherlock &amp; Mycroft lasts seven turns (days of investigation). At the beginning of each day, famous characters extracted from the books of Arthur Conan Doyle appear in London.<br/><br/>Each player has three action tokens that move from one character to another to use their special abilities, knowing that a player can never have two tokens on the same character. Therefore, a character must be freed before reuse. The abilities of each character allow them to obtain Evidence Cards or gain Investigation Tokens in multiple ways.
