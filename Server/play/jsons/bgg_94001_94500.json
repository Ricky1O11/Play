From 1741 to 1748 this relatively unknown conflict raged on the continent of Europe. The primary land actions took place in three theatres: the Low Countries, Germany, and Italy. Each of the other games covers one of these theatres. Charlie's Year covers the famous Jacobite Rising of 1745-46, which was instigated by the French, partly as a plot to topple the Georgian regime and partly as a ploy to divert the British Army from its operations in Flanders.<br/><br/>From 1743 on, Britain and France were formally at war. In late August of 1745, Charles Edward Stuart, better known as Bonnie Prince Charlie, landed at Loch nam Uamh with seven men, raised the Standard of the outcast Stuart kings at Glenfinnan, and gathered to himself an army to challenge the might of King George II's realm. Composed of wild Highlanders, Lowland peasants, discontented gentlemen and diehard Jacobite nobles, the Pretender's army defeated the local garrison forces and laid all Scotland at his feet. A descent on England should now have given the Prince's reluctant French allies the diversion they needed to invade. Marching on London however, the Jacobites lost their nerve after reaching Derby and retreated, pursued now by the best regiments of the British Army. The French, working with information a couple of weeks out of date, were still not ready to aid them.<br/><br/>Confronting each other at the battle of Falkirk in the winter of 1745, neither side appeared to prevail, and both withdrew to lick their wounds. However the tide of war was now firmly against the Jacks, and they withdrew again into the mountain fastnesses of Scotland, hoping to wage a guerrilla war and so encourage the French. The idea proved impractical, especially in mid-winter, and in the wet spring of 1746, the British Army under the Duke of Cumberland met the remaining Jacobite forces under Charlie himself at the battle of Culloden and crushed them. While Scotland suffered the fire and sword of the conqueror, the Prince flitted through the heather, and after many romantic adventures escaped to France, never to return. His allies the French were unconcerned, as the withdrawal of the British Army from Flanders allowed them to seize the vital port of Antwerp and a number of key fortifications necessary for taking the war to the Austrian Netherlands. At war's end, the price for surrendering these gains would be the fortress of Louisburg, Nova Scotia and the temporary restoration of French colonial dominance in North America.<br/>The Game<br/><br/>Charlie's Year Redux is a remake. Like its predecessors, it is a two player strategy game. You play one of the royal contenders, with all of Scotland and England as your battleground. You must decide when and where to commit resources, where to feint and where to strike. But you also have command of any immediate battlefield, and must array your forces for battle, deciding when to employ the cavalry, when to release your reserves, or whether to launch a fearsome 'highland charge'. Technically CYR can be rated as an operational game for scale, but at that time there was no operational theory of war: individual regiments were temporarily banded into armies for a single campaign (often with no clear purpose beyond the seeking of glory by an aristocratic officer corps), and the army commander, or even the King himself, would be in charge on a battlefield still small enough to see his entire command.<br/><br/>The game is played in a series of turns, each representing one month, and broken into a series of discrete 'operations' by your mobile forces, using garrisoned fortifications as bases and pivot-points. As the seasons change, a variety of weather conditions will plague your decision making. You have many sources of assistance, but their employment in this 'sideshow' may ruin your chances of victory elsewhere and thus lose you the game. The primary focus is on the campaign game, but there are also shorter historical scenarios covering portions of the Rising and even individual battles. The campaign game is quite flexible in its victory conditions, allowing you to experiment with different ideas for victory. There are also variant campaign rules.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Third edition"], "name": "Charlie's Year Redux", "playingtime": "480", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "8.05", "boardgameexpansion": ["Highland Quorum", "Perdition to King George!"], "usersrated": "10", "boardgamefamily": ["Age of Kings", "Lace Wars"]}, "94260": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1125496.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ian Weir"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "12", "boardgamepublisher": ["Red Sash Games"], "maxplaytime": "480", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1125496_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "480", "boardgamecategory": ["Age of Reason", "Expansion for Base-game", "Wargame"], "description": "Perdition to King George! (PKG) is a study of two hypothetical events in the history of the Jacobite Movement: the plots to overthrow the Georgian regime of Britain by landing Swedish, or alternatively, Spanish troops in Britain.<br/><br/>The famous Swedish monarch, Charles XII, was sympathetic to the Jacobite Cause, and in the years 1717-1719 was not that far away, fighting the Danes in Norway. Rumours have it he was preparing a base of operations for an invasion of England or Scotland with 12,000 men; James Edward Stuart, the Old Pretender, would be set up as a puppet king. In the event, Charles XII was killed in 1718 and the plots came to nothing, but what if he had not died?<br/><br/>With the death of the Last Viking, the Jacobites were forced to look for another backer, and found it in Spain, where the shifty Cardinal Alberoni was engineering a war against France that would ultimatey drag in the Empire and the English. (It should be noted that the Jacobites' traditional supporter, France, now under an insecure and anglophilic Regent, the Duc d'Orleans, was uninterested in helping them. Indeed, d'Orleans offered a brigade of French troops to help England stave off the threat of a new Spanish Armada!) In the event, the Armada was wrecked, but a small independent party of Jacobites and Spanish soldiers did land on Scotland's rugged west coast, even fighting a battle with loyalist troops before surrendering.<br/><br/>Either invasion could have succeeded. King George I of England took the blame for most of the country's ills following the late War of the Spanish Succession. He relied too much on his Whig friends, which on the one hand gave Parliament more power over royal affairs than ever before, and on the other, encouraged many who would not otherwise have done so to support the Jacobite Cause of restoring the Stuart dynasty. Furthermore, Scotland had suffered a political union with England in 1707, and many in that country were unhappy. The Swedes and or the Spanish would be seen as liberators (the Swedes with the advantage of their Protestant faith, the Spanish with the advantage of closer ties to James Stuart, Scotland's &quot;true&quot; king).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "Perdition to King George!", "playingtime": "480", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "7.25", "boardgameexpansion": ["Charlie's Year Redux"], "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": ["Age of Kings", "Lace Wars"]}, "94261": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Ray Tapio"], "poll": [], "name": "Forgotten Counters of World War II", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "yearpublished": "1994", "boardgameexpansion": ["Advanced Squad Leader"], "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Advanced Squad Leader"], "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Critical Hit, Inc."], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Wargame", "World War II"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This is an early ASL scenario pack by Critical hit used for tournament competition at ASL Oktoberfest.

Players must be quick to grab the particles according to the correct sequence in the first moments of the universe after the Big Bang: first neutrinos, then lepton-antilepton pairs and lastly quarks and antiquarks to form baryons and mesons (which must be correctly formed). The player with most lepton-antilepton pairs and mesons and baryons is the winner.<br/>     Let's detect (2 players): The players use their cards to form correct particle decays.

CSGMD! can be played using different settings and themes (some suggestions are given in chapter Four, but they are, of course, guidelines only). The one general rule is that the players take on the roles of supervillains: evil businessmen, mutants, aliens and criminal masterminds, united in a common goal - to destroy their arch-nemesis, Captain Superguy. This is not an easy task, however. Captain Superguy is powerful and all attempts to defeat him have come to naught. The time has come for an unlikely alliance...<br/><br/>To play the game you will need at least four players, one of which will act as the Gamemaster for your session (or sessions), several 10-sided dice and some time before actually starting playing to generate your characters and the main Non-Player Character, Captain Superguy himself!

The planet's surface is nothing but water as far as the eye can see and always has been since time immemorial. But man does not live on the seas. Instead he lives in the many massive cities floating in the skies. All told there are several hundred such cities in Aquaero, each typically several hundred miles apart and at least a mile off the surface. As such, travel in Aquaero takes place almost exclusively by air. Gyrocopters taxi people about the cities. Planes of all sizes and shapes run goods to and from the various ports of various cities, and the wealthy take cruises in zeppelins and dirigibles. There are a few boats, but not many. Sea travel is slower, less efficient (unless those aboard are using sails), and just as dangerous. The waves can become violent, as can the creatures of the deep. All of this is to say nothing of the hassle of transferring goods from boat to plane. Still, the threat of running out of fuel and crashing into the seas is a very real danger, especially considering the ever-shifting nature of cities. As such, almost every aircraft in existence comes equipped with pontoons or other gear for a water landing. It's only practical.<br/><br/>Life on Aquaero, or at least human life, lives in the Cities, enormous masses of power and steel sometimes as much as ten miles across suspended in air, held aloft by technology they cannot pretend to understand, a legacy left to them millennia ago by the ancient and enigmatic Engineers. No record remains of who built the cities or how the machinery works. People only know they must keep the generators running at all times or the city loses power. When they lose power, the turbines stop, and an entire civilization crashes to their doom in the icy waters below. These generators run on a rare and precious fuel called trozine gas, which can only be found at the Platforms, refineries resting atop the ocean's surface which gather the crude substance from somewhere within the watery depths and refine it into trozine, after which it is stored in large canisters free for the taking. The entire process, as far as anyone can tell, is automated, and a volunteer police force sprouted up around most Platforms to ensure that no one city monopolizes the trozine. That isn't to say there aren't those who would love to have a trozine refinery all to themselves...<br/><br/>"}, "94276": {"poll": [], "name": "Tiki 10 Pin Gold", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat"], "videogameversion": ["iPhone edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic952921.png", "videogametheme": ["Animals", "Nature / Jungle", "Sports - Bowling"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Half Fast Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["iPhone"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Half Fast Games"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic952921_t.png", "description": "Experience Monkey Bowling like you never have before!<br/><br/>Fully physics driven 10 pin Monkey Bowling with spectacular special FX!<br/><br/>Flick fast for that risky shot at a strike!

With war on the horizon and whisperings of a prophetic storm approaching, now is the time to gather all your strength and set out to forge your place in Terrinoth's book of legends!<br/><br/>Rune Age is a deck-building game of adventure and conquest for 1-4 players. Set in the fantasy realm of Terrinoth (Runebound, Descent: Journeys in the Dark, Runewars, and DungeonQuest), Rune Age puts players in control of one of four races, vying for dominance in a world embroiled in conflict.<br/><br/>Designed by Corey Konieczka, Rune Age is a unique deck-building game that centers around scenarios. The four different scenarios included in Rune Age present alternate win conditions for players, from an all-out war to determine the victor to a cooperative game experience where players all win or lose together. Scenarios not only dictate the win conditions, they also determine which card types will populate Terrinoth (forming the central card pools) and which Event cards will form the Event deck. The Event deck contains thematic challenges, enemies, and happenings that are tied to the chosen scenario, creating a new play environment each turn.<br/><br/>Gameplay in Rune Age centers around players working to develop their individual deck of cards. At the beginning of the game, each player begins with a small assortment of cards in their deck, drawing five cards each turn to carry out their actions. Each player's deck represents their faction's military strength and capabilities. These decks will be formed with their faction-specific Unit cards and a central collection of Neutral Unit cards, Tactics cards, and Gold cards.<br/><br/>While players begin with limited cards in their deck, through cunning and strategic use of their available cards, players can expand their deck to create a destructive force of their own clever design. Will you create brutal deck of formidable Units? Or will you rely on Gold and Influence to acquire neutral forces and powerful Tactics?<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Chinese edition", "English first edition", "French first edition", "German first edition", "Italian edition", "Japanese edition", "Korean Edition", "Polish edition", "Spanish edition"], "average": "6.86611", "name": "Rune Age", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Deck / Pool Building", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": ["Rune Age: Oath and Anvil"], "usersrated": "3562", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games", "Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["The Realms of Terrinoth"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["1P 037 - Rune Age", "An Entourage of Swift Canoes", "AP Podcast \u2013 Episodio 3: Especial Terrinoth", "Episode 10 - Not Just Another Hurricane", "Episode 1: Troyes, Willow, and Warhammer Quest", "Episode 36: Losing Geek Cred - Nothing Personal + Guilty Pleasures", "Episodio 3 \u2013 Hom\u00ednidos 2011 y entrevista a Pol Cors", "Podcast #045 - Edge Days 2011", "Session Impressions: Rune Age", "Strange Assembly 040 \u2013 Beyond Gamers and Evil", "The Game Pit: Episode 20 - Picking Over the Bones", "The Game Pit: Episode 44 - Lobstercon", "The Good, The Board and The Poodle Puddle: Episode 62 \u201cStorytelling in Games\u201d"]}, "94363": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Pierre Bourque"], "average": "6.18947", "poll": [], "name": "Vizia", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "38", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic935501_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Alex Weldon"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["MJ Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic935501.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual first edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Vizia consists of 72 colored triangular tiles, with a dozen triangles in each of the primary and secondary colors, and 48 player tokens, a dozen in each of four colors.

Each tile must be laid adjacent to at least one other tile in play, and the color of the tile must be next to the color of adjacent tiles on the color wheel.

However, it has the fewest exclusive rules of the three games currently in the series (Saipan &amp; Tinian and Attu &amp; Kiska). This means that it should be the easiest and quickest to learn. The large size of the island allows both players to employ a wide variety of strategy options. As with most of the other games in the series, the victory conditions do not focus on geographic locations. The situation is simply a fight between both sides.<br/><br/>Planning is the first step, and quite possibly the most important one too. The US player has to examine the Japanese dispositions, by looking over the map and using the limited intelligence rules to try to figure out where the Japanese main defenses are. Next in the planning cycle is to pick landing locations and then select the composition and order of your beachheads and landing forces. Once the US player lands on the island he has to eliminate the Japanese units. That is a pretty simple goal, but it may not be as easy as it sounds! You have to do it within the game&rsquo;s time limit. He will have to find that perfect balance between time, maneuver, and combat. Too slow, cautious, or methodical and you run out of time. Too impatient and aggressive and you will suffer too many casualty points to win.<br/><br/>In Guam the Japanese player has many options; the most of all the games in the series. You still have many of the same conditions as the other games, such as fortifications, being outnumbered, defending against an overwhelming invasion, and your opponent has air and naval superiority. However, you have a large enough force on a large enough island to allow far more opportunity for maneuvering. The Japanese player also has a variety of terrain types to incorporate into his defense. The clever use of dummy positions can fool the US player, making him attack unmanned positions or chasing scattered dummy units all over the map. But as in all the games, the Japanese player must have a well thought out plan with several courses of action in mind. Fortifications and dummies must be well placed in anticipation of US player moves.<br/><br/>The Series<br/><br/>Game scale:<br/><br/>Unit size: Platoon, Company, and Battalion.<br/><br/>Scale: Hex scale: 1/2 mile.<br/><br/>Game Turn: Each turn represents 12 hours.<br/><br/>The Pacific Island Series game system is a simulation of ground combat in the Pacific during World War II.

One player takes the role of Marlborough, commanding the British and Allied forces, and the other of Tallard, leading the Franco-Bavarians.  At Blenheim Marlborough found himself confronting a superior Franco-Bavarian force in a strong defensive position. Like Hannibal's great victory at Cannae, Blenheim was won by the successful implementation of a bold and imaginative plan. The flanks of the Franco-Bavarian forces were pinned by furious attacks at unfavourable odds which denuded their centre of troops re-deployed to buttress the hard-pressed wings. Then Marlborough released his cavalry to smash what was left of Franco-Bavarian centre and cleave Tallard's army into two. The threat that Louis XIV's France would come to dominate Europe was over.<br/><br/>The Seven Hex System (SHS) derives its name from the map which is divided into areas comprised of seven hexes which enables the player to adopt various positions within an area to reflect different tactical formations thereby making it more likely that an attack will succeed or defending units will stand firm.   The SHS incorporates several unique features intended to replicate in a simple and intuitive way the options available to a commander (the wargamer) of a large army.  So whilst the commander has complete freedom to devise a plan, and a good deal when positioning units which have yet to encounter the enemy, once battle is joined the options become increasingly limited and unforeseen events can play a part in determining the outcome of events but the commander can still influence these at a tactical level. The key to success is a sound plan with a margin for error which allows for ill-fortune, the shrewd deployment of units so as to be able to implement that plan, and the timely commitment of reserves.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>    22&quot; x 34&quot; Game Map<br/>    176 - EasyPunch 6/10&quot; Counters<br/>    16 pages Game Rules<br/>    3 Charts Player Aids<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "0", "name": "The Battle of Blenheim, 1704", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "5.66667", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": ["Age of Kings"]}, "94372": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Mark Woloshen"], "poll": [], "name": "Battles of the Northwest Rebellion", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Canada"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic936627_t.jpg", "average": "4.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Legion Wargames LLC"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic936627.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "(from the company website)<br/><br/>In 1885, western Canada is rocked by the specter of rebellion.

The result was the Northwest Rebellion, which started with the Battle of Duck Lake in March and ended with the Battle of Loon Lake in June. In the meantime, 5,000 government soldiers covered thousands of kilometers and fought four pitched battles against various First Nations and Metis opponents. Fish Creek was a meeting engagement that caused the government forces to re-evaluate their strategy against the Metis. Cut Knife Hill was a reconnaissance in force, which almost cost the government a &quot;Custer&quot; like tragedy.

One player represents France and her colonial troops. The other player represents the armed force of Viet Minh, the communist/nationalist independence movement of Vietnam. This is a cage fight. There are no victory points, there is no marginal victory and there is no draw. Viet Minh wins by forcing the French troops to surrender. France wins by not surrendering.<br/><br/>Map and scale: The map covers the former village of Dien Bien Phu and surrounding areas. There is a small sub map of the French strongpoint &quot;Isabelle&quot; further south in the valley. There are several groups of French strongpoints scattered around the map, each one with a female name (all named after the commander - de Castries' - mistresses, according to lore). The map is divided into three divisional sectors (plus a fourth one facing the sub map &quot;Isabelle&quot;). Each sector has several zones that that represent Viet Minh trenches winding from the map edge towards the center of the map. Each hex represents 150 meters and each game turn covers three days. There are 21 turns in the game, but historically, it ended after 19 game turns with a Viet Minh victory. The scale allows a stacking of three French units (usually infantry companies) in a hex, but there are no stacking limits for Viet Minh battalions, which creates a chess feeling.<br/><br/>Three Viet Minh battalions form a regiment and three regiments become a division and there were almost four full divisions in the valley, as well as a full artillery division off map. There was also an equivalent of another three divisions in a replacement pool outside the valley. The French troops were a colorful array of colonial paras, Vietnamese troops, units from French Algeria and Morocco, and, of course, the French Foreign Legion. Some units are of average quality, some are outright terrible, but some are the very best that could be mustered...anywhere. A French battalion consisted of four companies and there were 12 battalions together with 11 auxiliary light companies at the start of the siege, as well as 16 artillery and mortar batteries, and three tank platoons. Waiting in Hanoi were another five para battalions together with an expected replacement pool of about 14 companies. In neighboring Laos, there were four battalions ready to march and perhaps save the day at the very end.<br/><br/>French supply: This battle took place far out in the wilderness of Vietnam and both sides had to adjust to the limited flow of supplies that could be brought forward, though air to the French, and through vast forests to the Viet Minh. Supplies, as historically was the case, tend to be a lot less than wished for. There are several supply tracks on the map showing how much ammo, food &amp; bullets, fuel &amp; spares, medicine as well as the amount of truck transport available for the French. Each game turn air transports will bring in a mix of supplies together with replacements and reinforcements. This is done on a chart with a grid where a mix of supply markers are placed together with eventual reinforcements and replacements. Weather will then decide what will arrive and what will abort back to Hanoi. The French player will never know for sure what and how much will arrive and has to take that into account.<br/><br/>Viet Minh supply and morale: Viet Minh will receive a more steady flow of ammunition, but not enough to barrage whenever wished. There is a large pool of replacements to use, but although it is large, it is not infinite. If Viet Minh losses are too heavy, then the fact that you can only replace one step per regiment per game turn will be a painful experience. If loses are too heavy for too long, then the pool will dry out. Viet Minh's main concern is troop morale. The battle force starts with excellent morale, but each division's morale will decrease when taking replacements thus diluting the experienced veterans with newly drafted peasants with no combat experience. Morale will rise slightly when resting (not assaulting). But then again, time flies and there is a battle to win. Morale is a very important part of the game and if it falls too low, the troops will be rendered useless.<br/><br/>Artillery: Artillery is another important aspect in the battle. There are barrages from both sides before assaults commence. You wish to achieve two things with barrage: Losses, and to make the target shaken. Targets that are shaken lose abilities to react and support combat, and they become easier to assault. Defending units bring in barrage to make it harder for the attacker to succeed. Both sides, of course, bring in barrage in order to inflict as many casualties as possible before clashing in combat. Viet Minh artillery is off board and safe from counter barrage fire (mainly that they were dug deep into the mountain sides). French artillery and mortar units, on the other hand, exist as units on the board and may fall prey to Viet Minh counter barrage fire. French artillery units that are reduced and/or shaken are not as efficient, and those that are eliminated are...well, destroyed and out of play. Both sides have a limited amount of ammunition so spend it wisely<br/><br/>Combat: The main effort in the game is, of course, the assaults. Each player will conduct two die rolls during the course of an assault to determine the outcome. The defender first conducts defensive fire in the hopes of inflicting losses, but also to possibly force the attacker abort the assault. The defender&rsquo;s first die roll is compared to their strength and will show how well they defend (as a positive or negative modifier to the second die roll). The defender&rsquo;s second die roll (modified from the result of the first die roll, and defensive barrage), is compared to the assaulting unit's morale and will determine the result of the defensive fire. Providing the assaulting units do not abort, the attacker (who has suffered the effects of the defensive fire) conducts two die rolls. The attacker&rsquo;s first die roll is compared to their strength to see how well the assault is conducted (as a positive or negative modifier to the second die roll). The attacker&rsquo;s second die roll (modified from the result of the first die roll, and if the defender is shaken), is compared to the defender's morale to see the outcome of the assault. Other modifications, such as trenches, terrain, support from other units, etc., adjust the strength of a unit and make it stronger or weaker to compare against for the player&rsquo;s first die rolls.<br/><br/>So, even though many strength modifiers might be in your favor when you make the first roll, you will never know for sure what that result will be and therefore you will never know for sure if the second roll will suffer a positive or negative modification. Through this, a strong attack may go sour but a weak one may heroically succeed. By rolling two times, you won't be able to quickly calculate your chances with a glance at a single table. You will know what your chances of success should be but you have that damn barrage that may spoil the best laid plans, plus you won&rsquo;t know if your troops will crumble or stand strong against the incoming fire.<br/>Dien Bien Phu &ndash; The Final Gamble, will be as tense and brutal a simulation as was the historical battle that determined the fate of a war as well as shaping the events of things to come.<br/><br/>Kim Kanger<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "8.22256", "name": "Dien Bien Phu: The Final Gamble", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "0", "usersrated": "82", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["First Indochina war"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["I've Been Diced! episode 54: Kim Kanger", "I've Been Diced! episode 68: Randy Lein (Legion Wargames) and Roger Miller (Revolution Games)", "Three Moves Ahead 305: Kim Kanger and French Colonial Wargaming", "Wild Weasel #1"]}, "94374": {"rpgdesigner": ["Peter M.

There goal was to take territory in an effort to put pressure on the British government.<br/><br/>In 1866, a large, well armed and organized Fenians launched an attack on Canada West (Ontario) to put pressure on the British government. In June of that year, 1,000 Fenians, many of them Civil War veterans, marched into Ontario and were confronted by an equal number of Canadian militia. The Battle of Ridgeway ensued, and ended with the Canadians leaving the field to the Fenians. British regulars were on the way, so the Fenians had to make their escape back into New York.

The invasions took place between 1806 and 1807, as part of the Napoleonic Wars, when Spain was an ally of France.  The invasions occurred in two phases. A detachment from the British Army occupied Buenos Aires for 46 days in 1806 before being expelled. In 1807, a second force occupied Montevideo, remaining for several months, and a third force made a second attempt to take Buenos Aires. After several days of street-fighting against the local militia and Spanish colonial army, in which half of the British forces were killed or wounded, the British were forced to withdraw.<br/><br/>THE WATERS OF OBLIVION is an operational level wargame of the British attempt to conquer the River Plate area in 1806-1807.  There are two players in each game. One player controls Spanish and Platense forces, the other commands the British forces.

Each turn is half a day making for a 17 turn campaign game (uniquely playable among Market Garden games).<br/>  <br/>The expansive five map area allows each of the airborne division fights to be geographically isolated and separate, as was the case historically.

Both players are always &ldquo;in the game.&rdquo;<br/>  <br/>While the Allied player is busy dropping paratroopers, establishing bridgeheads and running a ground offensive to link up with them, the German player must devastate the airborne forces clinging to Arnhem, defend the various river crossings and counterattack to sever the Allied supply lines.

It was originally developed as a simulator of Konami's popular arcade game series Dance Dance Revolution, and has since evolved into an extensible rhythm game engine capable of supporting a wide variety of rhythm-based game types. Released under the MIT License, StepMania is free software.<br/><br/>The primary game type features the following game play: as arrows scroll upwards on the screen, they meet a normally stationary set of target arrows. When they do, the player presses the corresponding arrows on his or her keyboard or dance mat. The moving arrows meet the targets based on the beat of the song. Stepmania strongly utilizes a player's sense of rhythm in its game play. The game is scored based upon how accurately the player can trigger the arrows in time to the beat of the song. The player's efforts are awarded by letter grades and a number score that tell him/her how well they have done. An award of AAAA (quadruple A) is the highest possible award available on a standard installation and indicates that a player has triggered all arrows with &quot;marvelous&quot; timing (within 0.0225 seconds under official settings) and avoided all mines and completed all hold arrows. However, a patch is available that provides &quot;ridiculous&quot; timing (within a window of 0.01125 seconds, or half the timing of marvelous) and a top grade of AAAAA (quintuple A). An E indicates failure for a player to survive the length of the song without completely draining his/her life bar. Default scoring and grading for Stepmania is almost identical to scoring in Dance Dance Revolution; however, timing and scoring settings can easily be changed.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Stepmania&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "94404": {"poll": [], "name": "M.U.G.E.N.", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic936373.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Other"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Elecbyte"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "2", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Elecbyte"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic936373_t.jpg", "description": "M.U.G.E.N (also known simply as MUGEN) is a freeware 2D fighting game engine designed by Elecbyte, written in C which originally used the Allegro library.

There were two battles outside this tiny Missouri town, one in 1862 as the Confederacy sought to tap the agricultural produce and mineral resources of the surrounding region, and another in late 1864 when Sterling Price&rsquo;s Army of Missouri sought a brief rest during its retreat after the Battle of Westport. Each scenario exemplifies a different tactical situation.<br/><br/>I Newtonia shows a Federal &ldquo;demonstration&rdquo; against the town. A &ldquo;Demonstration&rdquo;, in Civil War parlance, is a threatened attack on a stronger enemy which doesn&rsquo;t actually intend to get heavily involved. Demonstrations are economy of force missions, occupying a larger enemy to support other operations. Here, a &ldquo;Demonstration&rdquo; simply reminds the Confederates that there was an active opponent in the areas.<br/><br/>II Newtonia is a classic delaying action. Both armies are fatigued and at the limit of battle worthiness. In addition, Confederate morale was low because of their defeat at Westport, lack of food and absence of any meaningful time to rest. The Federal army is buoyed up by their victory, but is equally tired and hungry.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "94440": {"rpgartist": ["MKultra Studio"], "rpg": ["Mutants & Masterminds (3rd Edition)"], "poll": [], "name": "Pack-Rat", "rpgdesigner": ["Aaron Sullivan"], "rpgproducer": ["Jon Leitheusser", "Hal Mangold", "Chris Pramas"], "usersrated": "1", "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic936982.jpg", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgsetting": ["Emerald City"], "average": "7", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Green Ronin Publishing"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Threat Report"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic936982_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Pack-Rat: The rodent that walks like a man... a cunning rat mutated into humanoid form, with a knack for taking the castoffs of modern society, both technological and human, and turning them to his advantage.

However soon after, his lab exploded and the scientist himself mysteriously disappeared. Now several years later there are new buildings on top of the forgotten slum where the experiments took place and suddenly a genetic virus has started to spread among the tenants turning them into vicious mutants. The two protagonists return to town after having been away for a long time and upon seeing what is happening they take it upon themselves to clean the town up before the mutants spread across the nation. Along the way they come across not just the mutants but also mechanically modified foes that the mad scientist has created to stop them.<br/><br/>One or two players fight their way through the five levels of various mutated and mechanic enemies, each level containing one or more sub-bosses before an actual boss appears at the end of each stage. The game plays close to the usual beat 'em up mold allowing the player to utilize various combos, jumping attacks, throws and special moves to utilize on the opposition. Rather than the standard fare of allowing players to pick up objects to use as weapons against the enemy however, Mutation Nation instead uses a system where the player can pick up one of four elemental spheres that allows the player the ability to unleash screen filling super attacks. There are also neutral spheres that will give life back to the player and increase the number of super attacks that they can use.<br/><br/>These are the various elemental spheres that can be picked up by the player and used for special attacks.

Each player has stats which can be upped by buying and eating food; special moves are learned by purchasing tattoos.

This particular supplement is driven to explore the extra-human consciousness of the Great Old Ones, in particular Cthulhu. Cthulhu, in his namesake story, remains dreaming in sunken R&rsquo;lyeh, transmitting his madness to the world around him at different times and to different people based off their sensitivity to such phenomena.<br/><br/>In a bit of a twist off the original story -- albeit not a large one -- the Great Old Ones represented here can be both tangible entities and intangible representations of natural forces beyond what human science can understand. Few of the Great Old Ones are represented here, largely for the sake of time and convenience, and in the course of these adventures, the investigators will never directly encounter the Great Old Ones. Nonetheless, this setting does employ the Mythos both in species and technology. In fact, several human technologies, displayed here as experimental and purely science fiction, are indirectly influenced by the Great Old Ones through a form of mental osmosis.<br/><br/>This work contains a scenario from the 1920s that pertain to another two scenarios later in the work in modern times. This understandably involves two separate groups of investigators played by the same players. There are a few recurring motifs throughout the work, as well as unmentioned plot devices that can either gain or lose significance based on how much of the mystery is unraveled.<br/><br/>"}, "94021": {"rpgartist": ["Brian Bolland", "Stephen Cook", "Adrian Czajkowski", "Anthea Dilly", "Andrew Dobell", "Brett Ewins", "Carlos Ezquerra", "Kythera", "Pete Schlough", "Chad Sergesketter", "Anne Stokes", "Alejandro Villen", "Sami Walu"], "statistics": [], "name": "Signs & Portents (Issue 19 - Feb 2005)", "rpgdesigner": ["Vincent Cooper", "Marc Farrimond", "Joanne FitzRoy", "August Hahn", "Ron McClung", "Alejandro Melchor", "Jonny Nexus", "Ed Stokes", "Todd Tjersland"], "rpgproducer": ["Christopher Allen", "Ian Barstow", "Ian Belcher", "Ted Chang", "Alexander Fennell", "Richard Ford", "Richard Neale", "Mark Quennell", "Bob Roberts", "Matt Sharp", "Matthew Sprange"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic931342.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Signs & Portents"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Design & Conquer", "Drazi Hunt!", "Editorial", "Eye on Mongoose", "From Beyond the Grave.", "Full Eagle Day", "Inside the Chainmail Bra", "Jonny Nexus", "Mongoose Open Day", "Mongoose Publishing Product List", "Power Classes Seer", "Snap Shots", "Subscription Page", "Tales from Mongoose Hall", "The New White Star Fleet", "The Wilds of Hyboria", "Write for the Mongoose"], "rpg": ["Babylon 5: The Roleplaying Game (1st Edition)", "Conan: The Roleplaying Game", "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)", "The Judge Dredd Roleplaying Game (Mongoose)", "OGL Steampunk"], "rpgpublisher": ["Mongoose Publishing"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic931342_t.jpg", "description": "Table of Contents:<br/><br/>6, Tales from Mongoose Hall: Dark Legacies Part 1 - Ian Barstow    <br/>8, The New White Star Fleet - August Hahn        <br/>12, From Beyond the Grave - Alejandro Melchor    <br/>24, Inside the Chainmail Bra: Tells the Tale of ...

It is a side-scrolling Beat 'em up game.<br/><br/>The game was developed by the same team of the X-Men arcade game.<br/><br/>An evil king has risen from the dead to rule the planet once more. But the souls of four guardians are inherited by four heroes, Ban, Max, Claude and Ivan, to fight the evil once again. The guardians wield the ability to shift into anthropomorphic beasts, augmenting more power as they fight their enemies.<br/><br/><br/>Athena (Top) sending from left to right: Ban, Claude, Max and Ivan.Ban(\u86ee), a Japanese Judoka. His guardian soul is a Fighting Bull, hence his beast form is a Minotaur. His signature color is red.<br/>Claude, a French swordsman. His guardian soul is a white wolf, and so his beast form is a white werewolf. His human form fights with a Sabre. Yellow is his signature color.<br/>Max, an American fighter with boxing style. His guardian soul is a black panther, and he predictably transforms into a panther-man. His signature color is blue.<br/>Ivan(\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d), a Russian Hunter with wrestling style. His guardian soul is a bear, so he transforms into a werebear in beast form. His human form fights with a small log. Green is his signature color.<br/><br/>The game's four main characters, Ban, Max, Claude and Ivan, are able to morph into anthropomorphic &quot;beasts&quot; (referred to as Beast Mode) by collecting a golden statue power-up. The power-up drops from either a random chest that falls from the sky, or through an anthropomorphic mouse appearing at random times and supplying the player with either a POWER-UP or a Beast Statue. The mouse will drop power-ups after a certain period of time, or if the player attacks him, similar to the elves in Golden Axe. When the players collect a statue when already in Beast Mode, the character performs a &quot;Screen Attack&quot; which destroys all onscreen enemies (if the statue is collected during a boss fight, the boss is hit hard and usually twice, but they can survive). The enemies are also anthropomorphic animals such as frogs, elephants, lizards, hedgehogs, boars, and others, and include bosses like Baphomet and Ra. Model DD6 and Model DD7 of Konami's Bemani games originate from this game. Model DD6 is used in the boss battles here while Model DD7 is used on Stage 5's main boss. In two-player games, players can choose from a selection of the main characters. In four-player games, each main character is applied to his respective player position.<br/><br/>"}, "94058": {"rpgdesigner": ["Brian Asbury", "Steve Barber", "Simon Burley", "Graham Cole", "Jim Donohoe", "Lee Gold", "Malcombe Griffiths", "Peter Harris", "Lewis Pulsipher", "David Row", "Slim", "Karl Tebbutt"], "statistics": [], "name": "Trollcrusher (Issue 8 - Mar 1978)", "rpgartist": ["Brian Asbury", "Steve Barber", "Jim Donohoe", "Barry \"Daisy\" Goble"], "rpgproducer": ["David Row"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic932159.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Trollcrusher"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["First Printing"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic932159_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Cover art is uncredited.<br/><br/>Page 2...Subscriptions<br/>Page 3...Editorial David Row<br/>Page 5...Aryxia III Brian Asbury<br/>Page 10..Oh Oh Ogre Eaters Needed - Review of Ogre by Metagaming Karl Tebbut<br/>Page 11..What's the Point?

Ryan Brown worked closely with Konami on the game's development.<br/><br/>The player characters in the game are Cowlorado Kid, Dakota Dude, Marshall Moo Montana, and a new character made for the game named Buffalo Bull. The game can be configured to allow up to four players to play simultaneously.<br/><br/>The game's controls consist of an eight-way joystick and two buttons for shooting and jumping.

Incentive Software published a version of this arcade game for many 8-bit home computers of the time. It will also be released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on March 9, 2010.<br/><br/>Moon Cresta is a two-dimensional, single screen shoot-em-up in the same mould as Taito's Space Invaders and Namco's Galaxian. The player begins the game with a small spaceship armed with a single laser cannon. After successfully completing the first four waves of alien attacks, the player must attempt to dock his ship with the next 'stage' of the ship. This second stage has two lasers in addition to the original one. After successfully clearing two more waves of aliens, the player must again dock with the third and final piece of the ship which also has two more lasers (giving the player 5 lasers in total). The trade-off for this is that the entire ship is a much larger target. Failure to correctly align the stages during either docking sequence causes the destruction of the stage being docked with.<br/><br/>After completing the first eight waves the player's ship reverts to the first stage and the process is repeated.

Every level was filled with a wide variety of different fighter craft and ground forces that all preceded the end-level boss (generally a large aircraft).<br/><br/>Players had a typical vulcan weapon that could be upgraded three times in order for the shot pattern to widen. Players also had an unlimited amount of ground force bombs that would increase in firing speed with the vulcan.

Soldiers are powerful, and affect the city they are played in.  Beasts are easily double the strength of the average soldier, but occupy two slots in the player's available army, and may be discarded to access powerful special abilities.

The Merchant guild is ready to pay outrageous amounts of money, and all the Seekers roam about to find them. Breaking news! The surface of the &quot;forgotten planet&quot; on the edge of the galaxy is full of them. In a few days, a new gold race will begin, with men replaced by robots that search, explore and fight to control the precious mineral!<br/><br/>The Forgotten Planet is a tile-laying management game in which tiles represent safe areas on a planetary surface on which robots walk and take other actions. These tiles also accumulate energy from the sun, then conduct it to robots, giving them (and the player) more actions if they absorb enough energy &ndash; so building and maintaining ownership of these tiles is fundamental in the game strategy. Players and robots use this energy to build new bases, discover mines, build walls to keep out other robots, push those same walls out of the way, produce more robots and much more.<br/><br/>If your robot falls out of contact with tiles you control, however, then it loses power and falls inactive for the round. Control of tiles is determined by the distance from a particular tile to each player's closest base; whoever is closest to the tile (with walls serving as barriers that players must &quot;walk&quot; around while counting distance) controls it, and the more tiles you control, the more energy you have available to you.<br/><br/>Thus, players need to maintain an energy connection for their robots while trying to extend their area of control on the planet's surface with their bases. They also need to control mines, of course, as that's how a player produces new resources, which are subsequently converted into new bases, sold for victory points (VPs) or converted into new robots.<br/><br/>The game ends when the playing area is filled with tiles or no land tiles remain in the supply. (Players can &quot;consume metal&quot; as one of their actions to speed along the endgame and crimp someone else's efforts to keep building.) Players then score points for the land and mines they control, with bonuses going to the player(s) with the most robots in play, the most common mines and the most bases. The player with the high score wins.<br/><br/>"}, "94124": {"poll": [], "name": "Tom & Jerry's Trap Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Cats", "Animals: Mice", "Cartoons: Hanna-Barbera", "Promotional Board Games"], "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic932444_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Kellogg's"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic932444.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Kellogg's First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Tom &amp; Jerry's Trap Game is a very basic game published on the back of a Kellogg's Rice Krispies cereal box.

You will begin in the store area with tyres bouncing around and a tidy robot to harrass you. You must go to the stock room, identify the parts required, and go up the ladders to each level to collect them (moving over the part will collect it). The gangplanks are none too safe and you must jump the gaps to reach the relevant parts.  There are various items strewn on the floors which again you have to jump over. These appear in different places on each screeb, so the game is a constant challenge.<br/><br/>You will then return to the assembly area to place the parts in their correct position on the car, but to deposit the upper parts of the car (e.g. windscreen, roof etc.) you will have to jump in the correct position.<br/><br/>You will start with 3 lives and gain an extra life for each car you complete.

After many years of hard work and loving care Pedro now has the most beautiful flower garden in Old Mexico. The trouble is all the animals for miles around have acquired a taste for Pedro's succulent blooms and are always looking for ways to break into his garden to eat them. From dawn till dusk as Pedro slaves away, the animals never give him a moments peace. He tries everything to stop them getting to his prize blooms, from blocking the garden paths with compost and bricks, to chasing them away and even jumping on them; but even so, some still manage to get through. Everytime an animal gets into the garden and eats his flowers Pedro has to plant more seeds, it's problem after problem, and if things aren't bad enough the village tramp keeps sneaking in to try and steal Pedro's seeds, so he has to be chased off as well. What with marauding animals and thieving tramps it doesn't look as if you're going to get much of a siesta either. So look lively, you can't put things off till manana.<br/><br/>AIM OF THE GAME<br/><br/>To stop the animals from eating his plants Pedro must collect bricks or compost from the bottom corners of the screen and block the maze exits. He may not carry or place more than one object at a time. Any animals getting into the garden will make for the plants and start eating them. You must decide on whether to block up the maze or stamp out the animals, then you must re-seed the gaps in the garden, at every possible opportunity.<br/><br/>"}, "94169": {"poll": [], "name": "Buzz!: Le Plus Malin Des Fran\u00e7ais", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["French PlayStation 2 edition", "French PlayStation 3 edition", "French PlayStation Portable edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Buzz!", "Buzz!: Brain of the World"], "videogametheme": ["Abstract"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Relentless Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Trivia"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2", "PlayStation 3", "PSP"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "description": "Buzz!: Brain of... is the eighth title in the Buzz! series of quiz video games.

The game includes all the characters from the GameCube version, and four more characters&mdash;Blaze, Frost, Jax and Kitana&mdash;from Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance that are exclusive to the PlayStation Portable system. The four characters, however, have one fatality and no hara-kiri in contrast to other characters. An Endurance mode is an exclusive new feature where players can compete against a constant wave of opponents. The system's Wireless Ad-hoc functionality can be used for multiplayer games. Characters who remain hidden in the other version appear unlocked in Unchained. The producer Shaun Himmerick commented that the staff wanted to show players characters that were difficult to obtain in Deception such as Liu Kang.
