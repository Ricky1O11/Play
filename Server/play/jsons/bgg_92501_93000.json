Each player will field a squad of tyrants, giant walking robots armed to the teeth with cannons, rockets, and lasers in an attempt to dominate the battlefield and crush his opponent under his metal heel. Sometimes, victory may mean simply being the last player with tyrants left standing, but a variety of scenarios are provided featuring a range of victory conditions so that every game is a completely different experience.<br/><br/>A full campaign is also included. The campaign will have players fighting for one of three factions over control of Gateworld Atropos and the future of the Allyrian Sector.  Rules are included for the variety of environs on the gateworld such that the gateworld's weather and conditons bring the battlefield to life.<br/><br/>The system is d10-based and features several areas of resource management leading players to balance risks versus rewards with nearly every decision on the table. The key behind this is the Overload mechanic in which a tyrant may be pushed well beyond its normal capabilities but at great risk to both the machine and the pilot. Players also have a limited supply of Tactics Dice which are used both in determining initiative and in activating special abilities provided by unique commanders. Gameplay is filled with difficult decisions in which every choice has a consequence.<br/><br/>The game was intended to be played on a tabletop filled with terrain but hexmaps may also be used without issue. All game measurements are made from a 1-inch round base so units may be represented by any appropriate miniature. In the very near future we will be releasing printable miniatures for each tyrant in the game.<br/><br/>It's a game about tough choices. It's a game about resource management. Most importantly, it's a game about giant robots blasting the hell out of each other across the torn landscape of the future.<br/><br/>"}, "92517": {"poll": [], "name": "Great 1000 Miles Rally", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA Arcade Edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1554621.png", "videogametheme": ["Driving"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Kaneko Co.

During this time, increasing numbers of people suffer possession by shikigami. Although the shikigami grant great spiritual powers, the strain inflicted on the host causes them to die exactly one year after possession. However, a legend has sprung up regarding Guwange, the malevolent god trapped in Mt. Gokumon (i.e. Hell Gate). If one possessed by a shikigami can gather talismans of the five Chinese elements--wood, fire, earth, metal, water--from five demons serving Guwange, then infiltrate Gokumon and slay Guwange, the shikigami will be destroyed and the one possessed will not suffer a premature death.<br/><br/>Shishin (age 35), with shikigami Rikiou (age 500+). Attacks with kunai. Unlike most hosts of shikigami, Shishin has been able to live for more than a year after possession. This is because Rikiou has made an effort to keep Shishin alive, so long as he kills other humans for Rikiou to devour. The fact that Shishin never speaks, and always wears the mask of an oni, has led to commoners speaking of him as actually being the human-eating ogre in question. However, one day, Shishin experiences a vision of a goddess explaining to him how destroying Guwange will not only free him of Rikiou, but also restore the one he loves to him--his lost daughter Mikoto.<br/>Kamono Gensuke (age 15), with shikigami Kirinmaru (age 300+). Gensuke is in training as a pharmacist, and the son of an onmyouji. Kirinmaru is a bloodthirsty tengu who holds a grudge against the elder Kamono. To fulfill that grudge, Kirinmaru has possessed Gensuke. In order to channel the tengu's malice away from innocents, Gensuke has become a bounty hunter, all the while looking for a way to free himself from the curse.<br/>Hiiragi Kosame (age 17), with shikigami Yatsuhisha (age 200+). Attacks with bow and arrows. Kosame is a miko and member of a family of demon hunters. During a conflict with demons, Kosame became possessed by Yatsuhisha, a kyuube no kitsune, and has been commanded by her father to exorcise herself of him by destroying Guwange. Unusually, Yatsuhisha is perfectly willing to help Kosame in this quest. Yatsuhisha was raised by a demon with little use for malice towards humans, and has come to regard Kosame as a close friend. Even though it would mean his own death, Yatsuhisha intends to put all his effort into saving Kosame from her own death.<br/>Each player gets a unique introduction, and ending after completing the game.<br/><br/>Guwange's gameplay contains elements that are unique or uncommon in the vertically-scrolling shooting game genre. The screen will often scroll horizontally or even diagonally, depending on the course the protagonist must take to reach the demon leader. Each character has a limited bomb attack in the form of an energy blast that can be sent in any direction, and will dispel any bullets it touches. Another special attack involves sending the shikigami into the midst of the enemies, with two particular advantages. First, the shikigami does not have to attack in the same direction as the player is firing, and can even get past obstacles that would otherwise thwart normal shots. If an enemy projectile touches the shikigami, it will change to a pink color and will drastically slow down. If the shot passes the shikigami, it will return to its original color and resume at full speed; however, if the bullet is caught in an explosion, it will be cancelled and turned into coins.<br/><br/>Score is almost entirely dependent on the continuous, uninterrupted collection of coins. The player must constantly damage or destroy enemies in order to replenish a countdown timer; when the timer (represented by a meter in the upper-left corner of the screen) depletes entirely, the player's coin count returns to zero. Guwange is unique in that the player may maintain a &quot;chain&quot; of coin collection throughout the entire game, instead of a more conventional stage-by-stage approach. This makes Guwange's scoring system extremely unforgiving.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Guwange&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "92543": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Lewis D.

It is Konami's second fighting game released after their 1985 arcade-hit Yie Ar Kung-Fu. It is also the first fighting game with multiple playable characters with different move sets, as well as the first mecha-based fighting game. Later examples of mecha-based fighting games include licensed games like Banpresto's Mobile Suit Gundam: EX Revue, as well as originals like HOT\u30fbB's Schmeiser Robo and Capcom's Cyberbots: Full Metal Madness.<br/><br/>The game is controlled with an 8-way joystick and three buttons: the attack button, the guard button, and the weapon selection button. There are six stages, each with different themes and environmental effects based on gravity. Some other features introduced in Galactic Warriors that were used in later fighting games include block damage, air-blocking, the ability to shoot/throw projectiles, the ability to execute multiple attacks while airborne, a modern health bar (as opposed to a health meter with notches like in Capcom's Mega Man series that made their debut two years later) and attacks of varying levels of strength.<br/><br/>Another feature introduced at the time allows the player to choose one of three Mechas, each with their own movesets: Samson, Gaea and Poseidon. When one is selected, the player must use it to destroy other robots in each planet. Other than the playable characters, there are several non-playable characters and bosses with original designs and unique movesets. In the final battle, the player will face the same character he or she chose. After defeating the final opponent, the game goes back to the beginning and the player's chosen character and the opponents will have an extra weapon.<br/><br/>Unlike in the single player modes of other fighting games, Galactic Warriors lacks continues and gives the player a number of lives similar to ones in some other genres from platform games to beat 'em ups. When the player loses all of his or her lives, the game is over and it returns to attract mode. In each battle, the timer starts at one minute and thirty seconds, and when it drops to zero before any player is knocked out, the player with the least amount of damage wins. Players can monitor this by looking at your life bar, at the start of the fight both players life bars are blue, but as the fight progresses, the life bar changes to a pink color for the player with the least amount of health remaining or most damage taken. Therefore, if a player's life bar is pink when/if time runs out, that player will lose. I haven't seen a game that monitors this since. The game tracks it right from the first attack.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Galactic Warriors (1985 arcade game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "92576": {"poll": [], "name": "Hachoo!", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Arcade Edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1556303.png", "videogametheme": ["Martial Arts"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Jaleco Ltd"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade", "Beat 'em Up", "Scrolling"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Jaleco Ltd"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1556303_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A side scrolling beat em up game.

The goal of the game is to use your Fighters and other cards in your Flight-Deck to destroy your opponent's Battle-Carrier, before he or she destroys yours.<br/><br/>Gameplay consists of drawing cards from your Flight-Deck on your turn, then spending Resource Cards (Fuel, Energy and Ammo) to launch Fighters and shoot their weapons in an attemp to destroy the opponents Battle-Carrier. The Flight-Deck also contains other cards to aid in the fight, such as Skill Patches for your pilots, Refits for your Fighters, Modules that upgrade your Carrier, and even Support ships to increase your firepower or defense. Resources must spent to play these other cards as well.<br/><br/>There are various kinds of Fighters at your disposal: Interceptors, Assault Fighters and Bombers are just a few. Each has their own strengths and weaknesses. Knowing when to attack with which Fighter is vital to winning the game.<br/><br/>Using your Resources, dice rolls, and other cards in your deck, your goal is to get your Fighters across the Combat Zone to the opponent's Battle-Carrier so they can make attack runs in an attempt to destroy it. Your opponent will send out Fighters to try to intercept and destroy yours as well. Any of your Fighters that make it through will be able to attempt an attack run on the enemy Battle-Carrier. Each Battle-Carrier has a limited amount of Armor Points. Once the enemy Battle-Carrier's Armor Points are depleted, it is destroyed and you win!<br/><br/>A combination of deck construction, Fighter tactics, and using your Resource Cards wisely is the key to victory. Resources can give a Fighter or a Pilot strengths and abilities that can win the day over the enemy. They can also be used to make your Battle-Carrier more efficient and deadly as well, thus increasing its chances for survival, and increasing your chances to win the game.<br/><br/>"}, "92593": {"poll": [], "name": "Monopoly: 2010 Fifa World Cup South Africa Edition", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: South Africa", "Monopoly", "Sports: Football / Soccer"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic983770_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Winning Moves UK Ltd."], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic983770.png", "boardgameversion": ["Winning Moves edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Sports"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "Version of Monopoly themed on the 2010 Fifa World Cup, including competing nations in place of the traditional coloured property sets, stadia in place of the stations and half time/full time cards instead of the chance/community chest cards.<br/><br/>"}, "92594": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic916258.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Claus Kuderna"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Artur Fast"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Elfenherz"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic916258_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Expansion for Base-game", "Exploration", "Fantasy", "Fighting"], "description": "The expansion pack was printed as price support for tournaments and as give away for the game fair Essen 2010.<br/><br/>It contains four new races and four new runes to play with the base game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["German first edition"], "name": "Die Insel der Steinernen W\u00e4chter Expansion Pack", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Area Movement", "Card Drafting", "Modular Board"], "average": "7.64286", "boardgameexpansion": ["Die Insel der steinernen W\u00e4chter"], "usersrated": "7", "age": "12"}, "92595": {"poll": [], "name": "Wings of Fury", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Amiga edition", "French Amstrad CPC edition", "Spanish Amstrad CPC Cassette edition", "Spanish Amstrad CPC Floppy Disk edition", "US Apple II edition", "US Commodore 64/128 edition", "US DOS edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic991930.png", "videogametheme": ["Flight", "War - World War II"], "usersrated": "9", "videogamecharacter": ["Grumman F6F Hellcat"], "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)", "Broderbund"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Scrolling"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "Amstrad CPC", "Apple II", "Commodore 64", "DOS", "Game Boy Color"], "average": "7.37778", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Broderbund", "DROsoft"], "vgcharacterversion": ["Grumman F6F Hellcat"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic991930_t.png", "description": "Wings of Fury is an action game with some minor simulation aspects, in which you are the pilot of an American F6F Hellcat plane aboard the USS Wasp.

Unfortunately, to escape Nuke&rsquo;s evil clutches, she has dematerialised into the Funpark&rsquo;s computer network, so Tracy will communicate only via a computer screen.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll need intuition, courage, wit, diplomacy, charm and a surreal sense of humour.

Other nations attempted to challenge the Vikings, and some met with success.<br/><br/>With a new world open to them, the learned minds of Europe were able to escape the grip of the Church, and the Renaissance bloomed unchallenged in Terra Nova.

Most travel is by horse, aeroship, or the occasional rail line. Though signal lines are slowly being strung across the landscape, most communication is done by pigeon, pony, or aeropost.

This battle is the one fight where the Hungarian paratroopers actually did a combat drop. Ok this is not 100% historically accurate, the landing was unopposed and the Hungarians marched into battle but still somewhat captures the action of a bridge capture. Uses boards 23 and 49 and is medium sized.<br/><br/>FE 51 Wolf Pack in the Hills: Many of you have been clamoring for a good ambush scenario. Ok maybe one of you, but here is a cool situation. An Italian convoy moves across the board 50 hill and runs into a Partisan ambush. Partisans basically have to annihilate the convoy, while the Italians basically have to survive.<br/><br/>FE 52 With Friends Like These: Set on boards 32 and 50 this scenario features the Italians (actually Albanians serving for Italy) fighting the Bulgarians. A nice tourney sized scenario the Italians have to capture some buildings from the defending Bulgarians.<br/><br/>FE 53 Operation Braun: This is the meatiest of the bunch with a large Partisan force defending against Croatian troops backed up by some armor. Set on boards 41 and 50, the Croatians have to capture some buildings. Tough to accomplish against stone buildings.<br/><br/>FE 54 Dubrovnik 2: This is an interesting one set on board 48. Attacking Croatian troops have to kick out a small Partisan force from the village. Then they have defend against a counterattacking force. The victory conditions are tied around holding buildings, with fortified buildings (which can be made during play) counting for more VP. A smaller sized scenario that should allow for some good replay.<br/><br/>FE 55 Friends No More: Here is cool scenario set on boards 4, 8 and FE1 (free for download from my website, for use with VASL). Germans and Rumanians try to control a bridge with the Germans having to get some VP over the bridge. Again, another smaller tourney sized scenario.<br/><br/>FE 56 Covering the Retreat: This is a medium sized scenario set on boards w and 18. Defending Germans get some armor including French tanks and have to defend against a tidal wave, well a small wave of Russian combined arms. Germans try to hold onto a building or 3.<br/><br/>FE 57 War Without End: Defending Germans with some Italian tanks and assault guns defend the board 12 village from very powerful British armored troops crossing the board 50 hill mass. The Germans who are very brittle try to keep a hold of a building or two while the Brits race against time.<br/><br/>FE 58 The End is in Sight: A medium sized scenario featuring Croatian infantry and armor trying to break through a Partisan blocking force. Set on boards 10 and 44. This is another one of those scenarios featuring vehicles from Armies of Oblivion; another example of the vast amount of scenarios that can now be played with ASL.<br/><br/>FE 59 But We&rsquo;re Not Quite There!: Once again a tired Croatian armor and infantry force, this time smaller due to previous battles tries to blast through a Partisan blocking force.

This is a dark fantasy noir game (with bits of science fiction added in for good measure) which means that the game has warriors charging in on horseback, necromancy, and strange beasts. As Midian is in the Dark Fantasy genre, the game focuses less on slaying monsters in caves, saving princessess, and amassing obscene amounts of power and wealth, but rather it focuses more on personal struggles, man's inhumanity to man, grey morality, personal horror, and the other less pretty aspects of life.<br/><br/>Playing Midian requires no dowloads or purchases. It is a table-top roleplaying game, meaning you and your friends play this together with pencils &amp; dice, rather than using cards or a board, or in front of a computer.

Offering a brief, comprehensive history of the universe and an in-depth look at events from the Truce of Tukayyid through early 3062, this update is a must for any BattleTech fan. Shattered Sphere also includes detailed maps showing the current state of the Inner Sphere and the Clans.<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>Although Shattered Sphere was released at something of an odd time as it fell halfway through the release schedule of the BattleTech Field Manual series. It provides a general update on the major changes and events affecting the various Houses, Clans and major Periphery powers from the 3050s through to around 3061; the detailed state and border maps are very useful for BattleTech and BattleForce 2 campaigns, and this sourcebook is one of the few to touch on two of the up and coming Periphery powers, the Marian Hegemony and the Circinus Federation.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "6.25", "name": "BattleTech: Shattered Sphere", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": ["BattleTech Field Manual: Federated Suns", "Classic BattleTech: FedCom Civil War", "Battleforce 2", "BattleTech", "BattleTech Field Manual: Lyran Alliance", "BattleTech Field Manual: The Periphery", "BattleTech: 20 Year Update", "BattleTech: Handbook \u2013 House Steiner", "BattleTech: Objective Raids"], "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": ["BattleTech"]}, "92687": {"videogame": ["JetFighter 2015"], "poll": [], "name": "JetFighter V: Homeland Protector", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogamecompilation": ["JetFighter 2015"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["JetFighter"], "videogametheme": ["Flight", "War - Modern"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamecharacter": ["General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon", "Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor"], "videogamedeveloper": ["InterActive Vision Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Flight Simulator"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "videogameversion": ["NA Windows release"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Global Star Software"], "vgcharacterversion": ["General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon", "Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>In JetFighter V, a terrorist cult has invaded Western America, and you, as an American pilot, must combat their mysterious army.

The design became the basis for what later became the ORIC, ATMOS and later computers, which had similar keyboard addressing and tape I/O as in the Microtan 65. The Microtan 65 had a single step function that could be used for debugging at the hardware level. The computer was available as ready-built boards or as kits consisting of board and components requiring soldering together.<br/><br/>The Microtan 65 was intended as a general purpose microcomputer which could be used by laboratories, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM)s and the computer enthusiast, and it was designed with expandability in mind. In this way the customer could customise the system, be it as a specialised control system, as a learning tool, or as a general purpose computing device.<br/><br/>Price of the Microtan 65 board in 1981 was &pound;79.35 (inc. VAT) in kit form or &pound;90.85 ready-assembled. The system was not generally available in the shops, one of the few stockists at the time being Henry's Radio of Edgware Road, London.<br/><br/>The Microtan 65 was quite simple by today's standards, with:<br/><br/>an NMOS 6502 CPU running at 750 kHz clock rate<br/>1K byte of RAM, used both for display memory and user programs<br/>1K byte of ROM for the monitor program (not even called an operating system)<br/>video logic and a television RF modulator, for the 16 rows of 32 characters display<br/>a software scanned hexadecimal keypad<br/>an optional ASCII keyboard<br/><br/>The major advance that the Microtan 65 had over a lot of the competition at that time was that the video display was flicker free. At the time a lot of microcomputers would either access the screen memory asynchronously to the video timing (causing flicker and splats on the screen), or would write to the screen memory during a non-display period (which was slow). The Microtan 65 got over this problem by making use of a major feature of the 6502. The 6502 (unlike most other CPUs) has a regular period in each instruction cycle when all CPU activity is inside the chip, leaving the external memory available without using complex external arbitration logic. This made video display design simpler and meant that video accesses could be made at maximum speed. This technique is also used on the ORIC and ATMOS computers.<br/><br/>The 32&times;16 characters was the reason that the 6502 was clocked at 750 kHz. To get the circuitry to work at a (nearly) standard video rate meant that the pixel clock had to be 6 MHz. When the Microtan 65 was designed only a 1 MHz 6502 was available, and so 750 kHz was used (6 MHz divided by 8).<br/><br/>The 1K byte monitor program (later increased to a 2K) was called TANBUG. The software facilities were rudimentary:<br/><br/>M = Memory modify / examine<br/>L = List a block of memory<br/>G = Go command (Run a program)<br/>R = Registers display / modify<br/>S = set Single step mode<br/>N = set Normal mode (cancel S command)<br/>P = Proceed command (execute next instruction in Single step mode)<br/>B = set Breakpoints<br/>O = calculate Offset for use in branch instructions<br/>C = Copy a block of memory<br/><br/>The Microtan 65 memory map is shown below ($ representing a hexadecimal memory address):<br/><br/>$0000 Zero Page<br/>$0100 Stack<br/>$0200 Screen RAM<br/>$0300<br/>$0400 End of Microtan 65 RAM - map continued from $0400 to $0700 as RAM on TANEX<br/>$8000 I/O<br/>$C000<br/>$F800 TANBUG V2<br/>$FFFF<br/>The screen memory occupies the space between $200 and $3FF. In addition to the standard 8 bits of screen RAM, there was an additional single bit RAM shadowing the $200 to $300 space. This was configured as a 9th bit write-only plane, and was used by the Microtan 65 for rudimentary, or &quot;chunky&quot;, graphics. Setting the 9th bit displayed a Minitel type block graphic.<br/><br/>The display is 32 characters across by 16 lines down, with memory address $200 representing the top left hand displayed character, $220 the second row, etc. The character representation is standard ASCII. Several pieces of Microtan 65 software write to the bottom line by writing to memory starting at $3E0 - the leftmost character on the bottom line, rather than vectoring through TANBUG.<br/><br/>I/O in the Microtan 65 is decoded into a 16 KB space to simplify the hardware. In fact the 1 KB of RAM is mirrored through the bottom 32 KB, the I/O through the next 16 KB, and the EPROM through the top 16 KB. If you added an expansion board (see TANEX below) the decoding was modified and the wasted space reclaimed.<br/><br/>In common with other 6502 designs, I/O is mapped into the memory space. There is no dedicated I/O space as on the Z80, 8086 etc. The I/O ports are (when fully decoded):<br/><br/>Write to $BFF0 Clear Keyboard Flag (Keyboard would generate an IRQ)<br/>Read from $BFF0 Turn Graphics On (enables &quot;9th bit&quot; graphics writes)<br/>Write to $BFF1 Used by the hardware single step<br/>Write to $BFF2 To write a scan pattern to the hex keypad (if fitted)<br/>Write to $BFF3 Turn off Graphics (disable &quot;9th bit&quot; graphics writes)<br/>Read From $BFF3 Read Keyboard Port (either keypad or ASCII keyboard)<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Microtan 65&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "92702": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Junior Dessinez c'est gagn\u00e9", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": ["Paper-and-Pencil", "Partnerships"], "yearpublished": "1989", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "18", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic924530_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Milton Bradley"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic924530.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Milton Bradley Junior Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Racing"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "User review: One player tries draws the object designated on the card while the drawer's teammates try to guess what the object is.

It was later re-released on the PlayStation 2 exclusively in Japan, as part of the Oretachi Game Center Zoku collection.<br/><br/>Haunted Castle is a typical platform game with six levels, which are played through in a linear progression. The player controls the main character, whose primary mode of attack is via his whip. He must fight various enemies which consist partially of skeletons, zombies, fishmen, and hunchbacks. By destroying certain enemies, he can switch his weapon to a more powerful spiked mace or sword. In addition, various &quot;sub-weapons&quot; can be obtained which provide different means of attack which consist of bombs, boomerangs, stopwatches, crosses, and torches. Hearts are collected to use each of these &quot;sub-weapons.&quot; The player can only carry one sub-weapon at a time.<br/><br/>Each of Haunted Castle's six levels conclude with a boss fight. Like in other games of the series, these bosses are generally taken from horror literature or legend, and include Medusa, Frankenstein's monster, and of course, Dracula.<br/><br/>Count Dracula slept for a hundred years. As he did, the village was at peace, and Dracula was nothing more but a mere legend.<br/><br/>However, one day a young couple named Simon and Serena were celebrating their wedding at the village's church. The couple were very happy as the wedding bells rang. Their future seemed blessed, but suddenly, the empty sky filled with dark clouds.

It is said to be the hockey version of Midway's Arch Rivals.<br/><br/>The game is unique because instead of having six players per team (like Konami's Blades of Steel), this game only has three (forward, defense, and goalie). Instead of being normal sized, the players look more like football players and have an older look to them.<br/><br/>In the arcade version there are only two teams (Red and Blue) and players can be chosen for each position. When Taito released the home console versions, more teams were added and players were automatically assigned to teams in order to get to the game faster. For the SNES version the colors were also given city names: Montreal Reds, New York Blues, L.A. Yellows, Toronto Whites, Chicago Orange and Minneapolis Green.<br/><br/>Hit the Ice is based on the game of ice hockey, the aim of the game being to outscore your opponent by shooting the puck into the opponent's net more often than your opponent over three periods of play.<br/><br/>Since the game is &quot;the hockey version of Arch Rivals&quot;, however, there are very few rules. Players have special moves, most of which are illegal moves in actual ice hockey (such as slashing, tripping, elbowing, or kicking opponents in the groin). Fights are common, though a player losing a fight is not penalized. Instead, he becomes sluggish for a short period. If the player loses several fights in one period, he leaves the game with an injury.<br/><br/>Every player is capable of a &quot;super shot&quot;, which must be charged beforehand. If allowed to charge and shoot, the shot will hit the goaltender with such force that he is knocked back into the net along with the puck, counting as a goal. If a team is far enough behind, his team may receive a power-up in the form of a &quot;super drink&quot;, making the stick of the player who consumes it flash with energy and turning every shot into a super shot for a short time.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Hit the Ice&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "92721": {"poll": [], "name": "American Horseshoes", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA Arcade edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1574888.png", "videogametheme": ["Sports - Other"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Taito"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade", "Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Taito"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1574888_t.png", "description": "American Horseshoes is a 1 to 4 player &quot;horseshoes&quot; arcade game released by Taito in 1990.

It was later ported to the Xbox in 2003, Microsoft Windows in 2005, and the Wii in 2008, in a compilation with The House of the Dead 2. The game continues the story of the previous games and introduces new gameplay concepts. The game's main protagonist is Lisa Rogan, daughter of Thomas Rogan, the first game's main character, and players control either Lisa or Thomas' former partner, G. This game was the most violent entry in the series until the release of The House of the Dead: Overkill.<br/><br/>The House of the Dead III departs from the original games in many ways: the most obvious being weaponry and story branching. The former is immediately apparent upon playing the Xbox version. The shotgun used in the game no longer requires the traditional &quot;point off-screen&quot; reload, but rather reloads automatically. Reloading still takes time, but happens without prompt as soon as the gun needs it. The arcade version differs here, because there is the presence of light guns, allowing for similar speedy reloading. A reload is achieved by pumping the shotgun controller. While playing the game on Xbox, the light gun controller released by Madcatz may be used; however, the traditional &quot;shoot off-screen&quot; reload was reintroduced in the Wii version.<br/><br/>A branching storyline existed in the previous games, but was handled differently. In The House of the Dead III, the player is given options for navigating through the game prior to the start of most stages, ultimately going through the same areas with different results dependent on the order chosen.<br/><br/>Another important difference is the absence of civilians. Unlike the first two The House of the Dead games, in which players could rescue various people in peril, The House of the Dead III contains no extra personnel beyond those central to the plot. Instead, &quot;Rescue Events&quot; occur during each stage in which the player will need to rescue his or her partner from attacking zombies. An extra life is rewarded for each successful rescue.<br/><br/>A new concept of the series comes in the form of a &quot;Cancel&quot; bar. In previous installments, the bosses' weak point would only need to be shot once to stun the attack. In this game, the bosses' weak point must be shot repeatedly to drain the &quot;Cancel&quot; bar and stop the attack.<br/><br/>Another major change to the gameplay comes in the form of a new rank and grade system. Players are now graded on how fast they dispose of the zombies, ranging from Excellent, Good, Faster, and Twin Shot, the last taking place if two zombies are killed with the same bullet. A letter grade is also given at the end of each stage, ranging from S, A, B, C, D and E. Completing the stage with an A rank will award the player with one bonus life, while an S rank will reward the player with two. A final grade is given at the end of the game, and depending on how many S ranks were received for each stage, the player may be given a &quot;SS&quot; rank as his or her final grade.<br/><br/>Extra lives and bonus points are also handled differently. In the previous arcade installments, nothing would happen if a player had all five lives and gained another. Now the player can have up to nine lives at a time, and any additional lives are turned into bonus points. In the previous games, bonus points could also be gained by shooting hidden objects such as a golden frog, or coin. The House of the Dead III expands upon this, introducing a silver coin that can be shot repeatedly, a wind-up robot that must be shot several times, and a golden miniature version of recurring boss the Magician. Decaying zombies and weak points on stunned bosses can also be shot repeatedly for extra points.<br/><br/>On the Xbox, PC, and Wii versions, there is a &quot;Time Attack&quot; mode where the player's lives come in the form of a timer, starting at 45 seconds, showing a play style similar to Time Crisis. Excellent, Good, Faster and Twin Shots give extra time, as do clocks in the background, successful rescue events and end-of-stage bonuses. Getting hit by a zombie subtracts 7 seconds, projectiles subtract 5, and bosses subtract 15. Stunning a boss grants the player 10 seconds. Every successful hit on the final boss also grants two seconds, and does not require a stun. The game cannot be continued if the timer reaches zero, and at the end of each game Dr. Curien gives his analysis of the player's performance. The player may also note the average distance at which they managed to hold back the undead in metres.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;House of the dead 3&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "92723": {"poll": [], "name": "The House of the Dead 4", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Arcade Edition", "PlayStation 3 PSN edition"], "average": "6.8", "videogameseries": ["The House of the Dead"], "videogametheme": ["Horror", "Zombies"], "videogamefranchise": ["The House of the Dead"], "videogamedeveloper": ["SEGA Corporation"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade", "Light Gun Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade", "PlayStation 3"], "usersrated": "3", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SEGA Corporation"], "description": "The House of the Dead 4 is a light gun arcade game with a horror theme and the fourth installment of the House of the Dead series of video games, developed by Sega. The game is an interquel and takes place between the events of The House of the Dead 2 and The House of the Dead III, and introduced several new gameplay concepts. Players can control characters James Taylor, from The House of the Dead 2, or Kate Green, a new character to the series.<br/><br/>The House of the Dead 4 is the first game to run on the Sega Lindbergh arcade system board. Currently, it is also the last game in the series to use Tarot Cards as names for bosses. It has yet to receive a console port despite the game's popularity and demand by gamers for it to be ported; the game has been in arcades for years, with no current plans for a console release in sight.<br/><br/>The player can reload the gun by shaking it. The game also features grenades that the player can throw to destroy large numbers of enemies. Additional grenades can be earned by completing certain tasks or by shooting crates. At some points in the game, players are required to shake the gun vigorously in order to escape certain situations.<br/><br/>The game features branching paths. Most of the paths lead to the same point in the game's story. As with The House of the Dead III, there is an end-of-stage bonus where players can receive extra lives depending on critical shots, accuracy, and score. Another returning factor is the presence of the &quot;Cancel&quot; bar.<br/><br/>The game runs on a critical shots counter where the player is encouraged to go for headshots rather than spraying ammo at the enemy. It starts off as Good, Excellent, Amazing and then Perfect. Getting hit, or killing an enemy not by the head resets the counter.<br/><br/>The most common enemies have three attacks. A &quot;normal attack&quot;, a &quot;grab,&quot; and a &quot;push&quot;. The foremost inflicts one point of damage, while the second forces a shaking sequence that, if successful, pushes back attackers for easier disposal, but if unsuccessful, will result in the player being bitten or the player's character being knocked down and vulnerable. Multiple zombies may also pile on top of both players in an attempt to stomp on them.<br/><br/>There are also a number of secrets in the game. Different hidden treasures, such as coins and golden shapes, which increase the player's score, as well as &quot;lives&quot;, etc. can be found by interacting with the game's environments. There are also &quot;treasure rooms&quot; that can be accessed using different techniques (such as shooting a certain spot or throwing a grenade in a certain area), which contain multiple items that can be obtained at once within a limited time.<br/><br/>In 2003, former AMS agent James Taylor and newcomer Kate Green (whose face bears resemblance to Britney Spears and an English/French woman) are gathering intelligence at the fifth basement floor of the AMS European branch office. The former of the two still has the events of the 2000 &quot;Goldman Case&quot; on his mind, and believes that the ordeal had not yet ended. A sudden earthquake rocks the room while they talk, collapsing the basement walls and leaving the agents trapped.<br/><br/>Several days later, Kate and James await a rescue team. James' PDA goes off, and a group of undead are seen on the security cameras. Realizing that they are in danger, James has Kate gather all the weaponry they can find in preparation for the arrival of their foes.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The House of the Dead 4&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "92724": {"poll": [], "name": "Hot Shots Tennis (Arcade)", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA Arcade Edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1556276.png", "videogametheme": ["Sports - Tennis"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["StrataMax Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade", "Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["StrataMax Games"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1556276_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A tennis game from strata.

It was originally released in 1993 for the arcade in Japan; however, it was later released on November 22, 1996 for the Sega Saturn console in Japan. The game is not widely known because it was not released elsewhere. Hyper Duel largely resembles the Thunder Force series that was also developed by Technosoft.<br/><br/>The game&rsquo;s story is not well-known as there is no English translation, but apparently it follows the archetypical shooter plot. A militant/alien group is threatening Earth and in response, Earth sends a unit of elite machines dubbed &quot;Buster Gears&rdquo; in order to defend itself. Thus, you assume the position of one of three pilots: Keith Spader, Lisa Rowling, or Dr. B. Lloyd. You then embark to defend the Earth through a series of several battlefields.<br/><br/>The Buster Gears are seemingly the typical fighter spaceships with various upgradeable weapons systems in the &ldquo;Fighter&rdquo; mode, but they can transform into an &ldquo;Armor&rdquo; mode, a humanoid warrior robot with several heavy fire arms. The Fighter mode is easily maneuverable, small, and fast; it also shoots straight in front of it. The Armor mode, on the other hand, is slower, bigger, and less responsive; it is capable of shooting up and down at a 45 degree angle, as well as straight. The firepower of the Armor mode is also superior. The weaponry of both modes can be upgraded by collecting P items which appear from defeating enemies. The ships can also acquire helper units by collecting either the T or G items. The Tracer unit is similar to the Fighter mode and it shoots forward when closing in on an enemy, while the Gunner unit is similar to the Armor mode and it homes on enemies. Both units also act as destructible shields.<br/><br/>Buster Gears change mode by pressing the alternate button. There are two buttons, one for the Fighter mode and one for the Armor mode. Pressing both buttons results in the activation of a special attack, involving two units that appear above and below the Buster Gear. In Fighter mode, they are stationary and shoot in a circular manner. In Armor mode, the units rotate around the ship and provide forward cover fire. This special attack depletes the special attack meter and when it runs out, the units stop firing. The meter is filled up by unit inactivity and by collecting B items.<br/><br/>Gameplay is similar to other Technosoft scrolling shooters, particularly the Thunder Force series. There are 8 stages in total. Stages consist of traveling through a scenario infested with enemies, which drop the various items aforementioned. Sometimes, there are minibosses, but there is always a rather large boss at the end of the stage. Defeating these bosses requires quick reactions and exploiting an inherent weakness. Enemies that are defeated yield points and upon completing a stage, several point bonuses are awarded. Extra lives are gained by acquiring a certain number of points. Unique to &lsquo;&rsquo;Hyper Duel &lsquo;&rsquo;is a ranking system, based upon how many P items have been acquired. The higher the number of upgrades the Buster Gear collects, the higher the number of bullets and shots on the screen.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Hyper Duel&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "92729": {"poll": [], "name": "World Cup USA 94", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Amiga Edition", "UK Game Boy Edition", "UK Game Gear Edition", "UK Genesis Edition", "UK Master System Edition", "US Sega CD Edition", "US SNES Edition"], "average": "4.5", "videogametheme": ["Sports - Soccer"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["U.S. Gold Ltd"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "Game Boy", "SEGA CD", "SEGA Game Gear", "SEGA Genesis", "SEGA Master System", "SNES"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["U.S. Gold Ltd"], "description": "World Cup USA '94 is a soccer video game developed by U.S. Gold for Sega Genesis, Sega CD, Super Nintendo, Master System, DOS, Game Boy and Game Gear released in 1994.

The Genesis/Mega Drive version carried the PolyGram Video logo across the stadium advertisement boards in the game.<br/><br/>This is the last official FIFA World Cup franchise game before Electronic Arts acquire the rights in 1996 for the FIFA Soccer series.<br/><br/>The game is viewed from a bird's eye-view perspective. Game time may be customised from as short as a minute per half to the full regular 45 minutes. A coin toss is determined by the 'home' team and play will commence. Depending on the options set before the match, the gamer may opt to have less dribble control (resulting in the game ball sliding in the direction of the player movement); manual goalkeeper control which puts the player in control of all goalkeeper saves and kicks; ball-trapping, of which the player will not be able to shield the ball and allows opponents to snatch it away without necessitating a tackle; and no pass-back rule which was implemented during World Cup '94 where a keeper may not pick up the ball whenever an outfield player passes it back to him.<br/><br/>If the gamer opts for manual goalkeeper control, the player would have to make a save by guessing where the opponent will place the ball and jumping into the general direction with any of the console buttons and the directional keys if applicable. Similarly, outfield players have the option to either pass the ball, kick it (when attempting to score a goal) or attempt a lob. Freekicks may also be executed using any of the above. However, a penalty kick is done in a different game screen similar to that of World Cup 98 (video game) and where a hovering indicator swings from side to side to indicate the direction of the shot.<br/><br/>Basic tactics (or preset tactics) can also be customised prior to the game and may be changed in-game. Team rosters, while not based on real-life players, have variable attributes amongst its players and divided into 3 major skills which are speed, dribble control and shooting accuracy.

The game was later renamed to Kick Man.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each round, a set of balloons and (in later rounds) Pac-Man characters hover above the clown. As each object is dropped towards the clown, different colored balloons fall at different rates. The player must catch each falling object on the clown's hat. If the player does not catch a falling balloon or character, they have a chance to kick the object back into the air. This gives the player another chance to catch the object.<br/><br/>If the player fails to catch a balloon or Pac-Man character before it reaches the ground, the player loses a clown (or life). They resume the round with one of their remaining clowns. A player starts with 3 clowns. When the player loses all their clowns, the game is over.<br/><br/>In the first round, the balloons &quot;pop&quot; as soon as they hit the clown's hat (no Pac-Man characters appear in this round). In subsequent rounds, as a player catches objects, they stack up on top of the hat. Each new object must be caught on top of the stack. As the stack gets higher, there is less time to catch a dropping object. After a certain number of objects are caught, the game will pause and the clown will pop all the balloons currently stacked on the hat (or the top Pac-Man eats all the balloons and ghosts above him), making it easier to continue catching objects.<br/><br/>There are two types of Pac-Man characters in the game: ghosts and Pac-Men. Both are caught on the clown hat, just like balloons. When a Pac-Man is successfully caught, it will &quot;eat&quot; any ghosts and balloons at the top of the stack.<br/><br/>After some rounds, a special bonus round will be played, where balloons and bombs will be randomly dropped from the sides of the screen. The player must catch the balloons while avoiding the bombs. Missing a balloon or touching a bomb ends the bonus round, but does not lose a clown.<br/><br/>The game was controlled by a trackball and a kick button. There was a technique to slow the ball down so that the player could walk away and take a break. The balloon was wedged between a short stack of balloons and the side wall. When you rolled the clown on the unicycle away the balloon would have a flat trajectory and move very slowly. It would take several trips across the screen to work its way up to the top, then repeat back down. A good player could talk on the telephone, take a bathroom break, or catch a snack from the vending machine before the balloon would come back down to the clown. Nobody could tamper with the game while it was in this mode.<br/><br/>The end of the game brought a screen dump of sprites, looking more like a crash of the machine.

The object in the game is to shoot outlaws in order to eradicate crime from a stereotypical Old West town. Like in the original, lives can be lost by shooting innocent civilians. The game was ported to the Mega Drive/Sega Genesis and Sega CD. It was also planned to be ported to the Super NES, but it eventually got canceled. Also, The Mega Drive/Sega Genesis port of the game, did not get released in: Japan, unlike the original game.<br/><br/>Lethal Enforcers 2 has five stages: &quot;The Bank Robbery,&quot; &quot;The Stage-Holdup,&quot; &quot;Saloon Showdown,&quot; &quot;The Train Robbery,&quot; and &quot;The Hide-Out.&quot; During each stage, the player must shoot the armed outlaws without harming any innocent townsfolk or fellow lawmen. If the player does hit a townsfolk, the computer will issue and admonishment like &quot;Don't shoot innocent folks!&quot;. One shot is usually enough to kill most enemies. At the end of each stage, a boss that must be defeated in order to complete the stage. Like the enemy bosses in the 1992 arcade game, they often shoot projectiles at the player.<br/><br/>In the game, the player's gun (a six-shooter) can carry up to six bullets. To reload, the player must aim his or her lightgun away from the screen and pull the trigger. In case of the Sega console versions, if a controller is used, the player only needs to press a specific button to reload.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, three to five life units are available. In the arcade version, more can be purchased by inserting additional coins. Life units are also awarded based on how many points the player scores while playing the game. Every time the player is shot or an innocent townsperson or lawmen is shot, one life unit will be lost. The game ends when all life units are gone, but continuous play is available.<br/><br/>There are different ranks that the player can attain, depending on how well the player performs. The ranks are: Posse, Deputy, Sheriff, Deputy Marshal and U.S. Marshal. When the game begins, the player's rank is Sheriff, and after each stage the player will be promoted, provided they have not killed any innocents. If the player has killed innocents on any stage, they will either maintain their rank or will be demoted. On the Sega Genesis, your accuracy for each stage corresponds to the rank you are given. 60%&ndash;69% will earn you the rank of Deputy. From 70%&ndash;79% is Sheriff. 80%&ndash;89% is Deputy Marshal and 90% or above is U.S. Marshal.<br/><br/>Additional weaponry can be found throughout the game that will give the player better firepower: 50 calibre sharps, rifles, double rigs, shotguns, Gatling guns, and cannons. The Gatling guns and cannons can each be used only once but the other four weapons can be reloaded the same way as the regular gun. If a player is shot while he or she has one of those weapons, however, they lose any special guns they have collected and will return to the regular gun.<br/><br/>In the arcade version, a DIP switch allows users to set the game to &quot;Arcade Mode&quot; or &quot;Street Mode.&quot; In Arcade Mode, one assignment follows directly after the other where, between each assignment, there is a target practice session where the goal is to try to shoot all the required targets to improve the player's accuracy. Street Mode gives the player a choice of which stage they would like to go to, including a target practice stage.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Lethal Enforcers II: Gunfighters&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "92753": {"poll": [], "name": "Lethal Enforcers 3", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["EU Arcade Edition", "JP Arcade Edition", "NA Arcade Edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Lethal Enforcers"], "videogametheme": ["Crime"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Konami"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade", "Light Gun Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Konami"], "description": "Lethal Enforcers 3, known as Seigi no Hero (\u6b63\u7fa9\u306e\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc&mdash;Heroes of Justice) in Japan is a 3D arcade light gun game which is the third installment to Konami's Lethal Enforcers series.<br/><br/>In Lethal Enforcers 3, players play as six different law enforcement roles in various scenarios in present day Tokyo, Japan. Players make their ways to checkpoints while shooting criminals, terrorists, or fugitives along the way.<br/><br/>Lethal Enforcers 3 is similar to World Combat which players shoot outside the screen to activate the shield.

In eras when the battlefield was dominated by heavily armored knights, archers represented the idea that skill and determination can level the playing field, both in warfare and conflicts between the social classes.<br/><br/>Robin Hood and his merry men are the classic icons of the heroic archer, but they are far from the only examples of that archetype. Historic examples of archer warriors range from the horse archers of Attila the Hun to the English and Welsh longbowmen at the battle of Agincourt. And when an archer&rsquo;s talent is great enough, the facts of his life often become overshadowed by legends and mythology, as is the case with China&rsquo;s Zhou Tong and Norway&rsquo;s Einar Tambarskjelve. Ancient gods such as Artemis and Apollo were famed for their skill with bows, as were the heroes Arash, Hercules, Houyi, Orion, and Ulysses. Plus, if we broaden our definitions a bit to accept any hero using ranged weapons, William Tell&rsquo;s shooting an apple off his son&rsquo;s head and David slaying Goliath further expand the ranks of heroic archers.<br/><br/>Such heroics are difficult to achieve using the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, and with good reason. The rules are designed to provide broad, flexible, balanced characters for players to take through adventures and, as history shows, skilled archers very much tip the balance in almost any combat in which they participate. But with the addition of archetype packages&mdash;a new character creation option&mdash;and a few new ranged weapon combat feats, it is possible to heighten the role heroic archers can play in your campaign without making them the overwhelming force they were on the battlefields of our ancient world.<br/><br/>"}, "92768": {"poll": [], "name": "Earth Defense Force", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US SNES Version", "Wii Virtual Console edition"], "average": "6", "videogametheme": ["Space"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Jaleco Ltd"], "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["SNES", "Wii"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Jaleco Ltd"], "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>The graphics will dazzle you, the speed will astound you... but if you don't think fast and shoot faster, you won't have a choice against the alien firestorm.

Guards! A Discworld Boardgame sees players taking on the role of newly recruited members of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch. With the Eight Great Spells missing from the Unseen University, the future of the Disc hangs in the balance. Each player is tasked with collecting and returning a number of the spells to the university before it is too late. Each player selects one of four Guilds to infiltrate: Thieves, Assassins, Alchemists or Fools. Their chosen Guild Card will give them a specific selection of the Great Spells to collect and grants them a unique Guild Ability which can be used to hinder their opponents. It is also used to mark the players Charm, Guild and Magic abilities, which can be developed throughout the game.<br/><br/>There are twelve locations on the board where players may charm (or bribe) volunteers to join them on their quest.<br/>The characters are split into three Volunteer Decks each representing the range of inhabitants who might be found in different locations within the city: Lords &amp; Ladies, Man &amp; Beast and Shades &amp; Shadows. Each Volunteer is assigned a set of skill attributes which can be used individually to protect the Spells, or combined with those of other volunteers and used to complete the Wizards Challenges - five tests of strength, brain, and worthiness which the runners must complete in order to enter the Unseen University with the Spells. A selection of enchanted scrolls, weapons, armour and magical items can be purchased by players to equip their volunteers and boost their attributes.<br/><br/>A number of volunteer cards carry the &quot;Mark of the Brethren&quot;, the name of a secret society which aims to summon a greater dragon to the city in a plan to overthrow the powers that be in Ankh-Morpork. If a player holds three of these cards at any time, he may choose to call a dragon to a specific city quadrant. This effectively shuts down that area of the city until the dragon is driven off. (Handy if spells are located there that your opponents need.) Opposing players may choose to face the dragon individually or to co-operate with other players and send a combined squad of volunteers to see off the beast. (Dragons may also be called to the city automatically during the game on the turn of a fate card. If this happens, all players must send at least one volunteer to face it.) Members of the Brethren may also be secretly planted in city quadrants to operate as saboteurs.<br/><br/>When a player feels has recruited the right volunteers, he moves to collect and return the first required Spell (as marked on his Guild Card). You can send up to four volunteers on a Spell Run. Opponents may use magic, or Saboteurs if they have one in play, to try to stop a spell run. If all (or any) of your runners make it to the Unseen University, they must attempt one of the Wizards Challenges (resolved by totalling a specific attribute score of the successful runners, with any bonuses gained from items or magic and a dice roll). If successful they have returned the Spell. The volunteers used are seen to have fulfilled their duty and are discarded. The player then goes on toward his next spell (recruiting new volunteers along the way). The winner is the first to return the five Great Spells shown on his Guild Card.

What they found within the tomb was astonishing &ndash; a hitherto-unknown papyrus the decipherers nicknamed &ldquo;The Book of Life.&rdquo; Similar to the Egyptian Book of the Dead (or, more properly, &ldquo;The Chapters of Coming Forth Into the Day&rdquo;), this papyrus detailed spells and rituals involving the Egyptian gods and death. But rather than being a guidebook with which the spirit could enter the afterlife, the &ldquo;Book of Life&rdquo; presented secret rituals and incantations apparently designed to bring the magician everlasting life in this world.<br/><br/>Cartouches on the sarcophagus identified its occupant as Setna, scribe and son of Rameses the Great. According to ancient Egyptian tales, Setna was a renowned magician who discovered the Book of Thoth, a source of great magical power. Upon opening the sarcophagus, the arch&aelig;ologists found it empty, except for the papyrus. Partial decipherment of the Book of Life revealed that it was penned by Setna himself, and it appeared that the only copy was buried in the sarcophagus, although what became of its author remained unclear.<br/><br/>Deeming the world unready for the secret to immortality, the Nags team created a catalog of the contents of Setna&rsquo;s tomb, surveyed the corridors and chambers to create an accurate floorplan, then set about re-burying the secrets within. They covered the entrance again, and did the same for the ancient grave robbers&rsquo; tunnel they&rsquo;d found, leaving the area looking as much like a natural and unexplored part of the Valley of the Kings as it had before their excavation.<br/><br/>The Cairo campus of the NAGS Society has been keeping a careful eye on the excavations in the Valley of the Kings, thanks in part to a Nag who is also a member of the Antiquities Service, a government council that oversees arch&aelig;ology along the Nile. Recently, they were quite alarmed to learn that some European archaeologists had discovered Setna&rsquo;s tomb and were in the process of excavating its entrance. Even more alarming, this excavation was being done in as much secrecy as possible, and in the heat of the off-season (most excavations being done in the Winter season, October &ndash; March). Could it be that the Nags are not the only ones to know of the existence of the Book of Life?<br/><br/>The NAGS Society has quickly assembled a team for an &ldquo;extraction&rdquo; mission. Their instructions are to enter the tomb &ndash; before the rival archaeologists break through the entrance, if at all possible &ndash; and retrieve the Book of Life from the sarcophagus within. Failing that, they are to destroy the Book of Life rather than allow it to fall into the wrong hands.<br/><br/>"}, "92786": {"poll": [], "name": "Menace", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["UK Amiga edition"], "average": "6", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction", "Space"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Rockstar North"], "videogamegenre": ["Scrolling", "Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Psygnosis"], "description": "Taking place in an alien galaxy, a group of planetary dictators are banished from their home planets for their megalomaniac crimes and rally together to plot their revenge.

This is R.A.R.E. (Realistic Advanced Roleplaying Engine), and it powers the universe of Broken Swords &amp; Battered Shields.<br/><br/>This fantasy setting takes place in the world of Soluna.  Players can take on the personas of well known races such as Humans, Elfare, and Dulklakan, or try out one of many more exotic races, like the majestic Solgard, descendants of the Phoenix, or the reclusive Polaren, towering creatures of ice from the north.<br/><br/>Create Spells and many other exciting features for your character, completely from scratch.  We supply the tools, you supply the imagination to make it happen.<br/><br/>Combat is tracked not in rounds, but in seconds, and every action takes a set amount of time to perform.  In this way, combat never is forced into a set pattern throughout the entire fight and provides dynamic gameplay for those at the table.<br/><br/>And the gem of R.A.R.E. is the MAX (Mote Advancement Experience) system for rewarding players for playing their character well, staying in character, and making the night as enjoyable as possible.  Gone are the days where killing things is required to level up your character.  Simply immerse yourself into the world and reap the rewards.<br/><br/>This Broken Swords &amp; Battered Shields Lorekeeper's Tome is an all-in-one book for both the player and Lorekeeper.  This is a revised and modified edition of visioNation studios' previous edition.

Filled with young souls seeking adventure and freedom, the Periphery is a watershed for every stripe of humanity. This diversity has spawned powerful Inner Sphere-like political coalitions, roving pirates, one-world lesser powers and bandit kingdoms striving for legitimacy. Wild, uncivilized and deadly, the Periphery is a turbulent frontier where any warrior who dares can be king. <br/>BattleTech Field Manual: Periphery describes the various factions that make up the Periphery: Magistracy of Canopus, Taurian Concordat, Marian Hegemony, Outworlds Alliance, Circinus Federation, the Lesser Periphery States, Bandit Kingdoms and the Deep Periphery. This sourcebook describes the history, military doctrine, traditions and tactics of each Periphery faction, plus special rules that reflect the exclusive capabilities of each Periphery regiment, as well as new weapons and 'Mechs unique to the Periphery.<br/><br/>User report:<br/><br/>This sequel to the earlier BattleTech: The Periphery (second edition)  is the final volume in the Field Manuals series for BattleTech to be published by FASA.

It was the first sourcebook to effectively treat the Marian Hegemony and Circinus Federation as states equal to the three long-established major Periphery states.<br/><br/>Whereas the other Field Manuals add new high-tech options to BattleTech, the Periphery Field Manual adds a low-tech option instead - the Rocket Launcher - a fairly primitive but dangerous set of one-shot weapons, and adds a fair number of assorted variants to existing 'Mechs that have been adjusted to carry Rocket Launchers as a part of their weapon arsenal.<br/><br/>This sourcebook was originally published by FASA in 2001, but was re-released with a new cover and new product code by FanPro in 2003.

If she draws an action card, she may be able to take a second turn, steal from another player, or force an exchange of one bone for another; she may also be forced to discard a card, or she might end up with a rock, which is placed back in the dig area for everyone to work around.

The screen shows a first person perspective from inside the car, through the windshield. To separate it from other driving titles of that era, stunt loops and other road hazards were added. The game generally consists of 1 or 2 laps around the stunt track. In certain modes, if the player scored in the top 10, the player races against the computer controlled car, Phantom Photon. In this race, it was possible to race the wrong way around the course and beat the Phantom Photon across the start-finish line. The game challenges the players in a daredevil fashion and broke away from traditional racing games like Out Run or Pole Position. Stunts, a racing game produced later, has similar visuals, controls and tracks. It was also one of the first games to allow for more than three initials on the high-score board; which enterprising drivers could use to their advantage to construct sentences during the course of game-play.<br/><br/>A notable feature of the game is the &quot;instant replay&quot; display that is presented after a crash, which sets Hard Drivin' apart from most driving games of its time, which after a crash would just put the player back on the road, stopped, and let them accelerate again. Before resuming play after a crash, Hard Drivin' would run an approximately ten second animation, captioned &quot;Instant Replay&quot;, which showed a wide aerial view of the movements of the player's car and surrounding vehicles leading up to the crash, with the player's car always centered on the screen.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Hard Drivin'&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "92923": {"rpgdesigner": ["Frank Brunner"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Spellbound Kingdoms Combat Primer", "rpgartist": ["Dover Pictorial Archive Series", "Igor Kieryluk", "Kismagu", "Jason McLellan", "Gillian Pearce", "Mark Quire", "Sade"], "rpgproducer": ["Zach Hoefler"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic919745.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "9", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Swashbuckling / Pirates)", "Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["T.

Among the jewels was a beautiful silver tiara, a gift from the easterling kingdom to the Elf Queen. Set with seven magical stones, the headpiece was worth a fortune. After sinking the elven ship, the corsairs turned for home, but a freak wind storm (summoned, perhaps, by the curse of the elves) blew them off course. The waves battered the ship until it sank. Only two corsairs managed to swim to a small island; one of them had the tiara stuffed in his shirt. The rest of the treasure was lost.<br/><br/>The corsairs decided to build a skiff and sail to the mainland. Fearful that the tiara would be lost during the uncertain voyage, they agreed to bury it on the island and return for it when they were better equipped. Since neither trusted the other,<br/>they bent the fine filigree work, and broke the crown in two. Separately they went into the forest, where each hid half.

Street Racer offered 27 game variations, grouped into the following sub-games:<br/><br/>* 1&ndash;6: Street racer<br/>    * 7&ndash;12: Slalom<br/>    * 13&ndash;16: Dodgem<br/>    * 17&ndash;20: Jet shooter<br/>    * 21&ndash;24: Number cruncher<br/>    * 25&ndash;27: Scoop ball<br/><br/>Each of the sub-games has roughly the same gameplay: the player controls a vehicle that must avoid or collect certain objects as they scroll down the screen. Between one and four players can compete simultaneously by using the paddle controllers, which allow the vehicle to move left and right along the bottom of the screen. If a one-player game is selected, the player competes with a static computer opponent that allows objects to collide with it or pass by.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Racer_%28Atari_2600%29' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Racer_%28Atari_2600%29</a><br/>],&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "92972": {"poll": [], "name": "Super Cobra", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Atari 2600 edition", "Intellivision edition", "North American Atari 8-bit edition", "US Atari 5200 edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic999823.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Military", "War - Modern"], "usersrated": "5", "videogamedeveloper": ["Konami", "Parker Brothers"], "videogamegenre": ["Endless Runner", "Scrolling", "Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Atari 2600", "Atari 5200", "Atari 8-bit family", "ColecoVision", "Intellivision", "MSX", "Odyssey\u00b2"], "average": "6.7", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Parker Brothers"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic999823_t.jpg", "description": "The player controls a helicopter and has to guide it across a scrolling terrain, battling obstacles along the way.

The player uses an &quot;x&quot; cursor to select and move pieces, rather than using chess notation. If an attempted move is illegal, a warning sound is made and the move is not made. If the right difficulty switch is set to A the computer plays as white; setting it to B lets the player play as white. With the left difficulty switch, selecting A allows the board to be set as the player pleases, whereas selecting B sets up the board for a regulation chess game.<br/><br/>There are eight different difficulty levels, with the computer-player taking a variable amount of time to determine its moves for each level. The approximate time length ranges between ten seconds (level 8, for beginners) to ten hours (level 7).<br/><br/>Bugs<br/><br/>A feature of the two most difficult levels (6 and 7) is that the computer-player's prospective moves are displayed while it is &quot;thinking&quot; -- in easier levels the screen is blanked to solid, changing colors while the computer is selecting its move. When &quot;thinking&quot; on levels 6 and 7, the computer-player sometimes fails to return a piece to its original position, resulting in its making more than one move per turn.<br/><br/>Development<br/><br/>At first, the idea of chess on the Atari 2600 was considered to be impossible due to the limitations of the technology at the time. For example, Atari had to overcome sprite limitations; the Atari 2600 was only capable of displaying three sprites in a row, or six (such as in Space Invaders) with the right programming. The eight-piece-wide standard chess board exceeded this limitation. To rectify this, Bob Whitehead developed a technique known as &quot;Venetian blinds&quot; where the position of each sprite changes every scan line; this allows for eight or more sprites in a row. Additionally, the concept of bank switching ROMs was invented for earlier prototypes of Video Chess that were larger than four kilobytes in size, however the released version ended up fitting the standard 4K size.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Chess,&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Chess,&quot</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "92974": {"poll": [], "name": "Monolith", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic946499_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Schowanek"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic946499.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "This is a dice game; 27 white dice are stacked in a 3x3x3 cube (the building or monolith).

After creating monuments in 'Doshin 1' and their counterpart pavilions, children will appear in the Expo area and you can &quot;tinkle&quot; on them with your hearts and they will join you, becoming what are known as Teamers or teamsters. There are two other teams you can choose from at the start of the game, and with enough pavilions completed you can battle the other teamster groups in a tinkle contest. If you win, the loser's team members become neutral and can be added to your team. You can have 6 other children on your team.
