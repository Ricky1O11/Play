Helper Elves (the remaining players) then choose a CONCEPT card that they feel best matches the IDEA card.  Receiving the cards face down, the Head Elf then shuffles and (reading aloud) presents the CONCEPTS on the table.  Using ANY criteria, the Head Elf then chooses which Combination of IDEA and CONCEPT to green light and send to production - thus scoring one point towards the win for the player whose CONCEPT was chosen.

Later, Genki Mobile ported the game exclusively to Japanese mobile phones.<br/><br/>Story<br/><br/>The year is 1999. The player is put in the middle of a war already lost when the Akudama Empire (known as the Krion Empire outside of Japan) attacks the Earth with its army of robots. No conventional weapon in existence is efficient against this opponent. The robots are however totally vulnerable to magic. A hired mercenary, Kagemaru, summons the only non-sealed witch, Doropie (known as Francesca outside of Japan) to stop the Akudama Empire's offense.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Players control the wand-wielding character, who can fire different objects based on the wand type the player has selected. The gameplay resembles Capcom's Mega Man series, while the cut scenes resemble the ones in Tecmo's NES version of Ninja Gaiden. Among other things, her outfit color changes when a different wand is selected (using a similar style menu). The powers included are the normal shot (red outfit), the phoenix ability (pink outfit), the freeze shot (blue outfit), the bouncing ball shot (green outfit), the shield ability (orange outfit), and the broom ability (purple outfit). There is also at least one enemy which resembles a Mettool (the hard-hat enemies; officially spelled &quot;Mettaur&quot; in the U.S.). Unlike the first three Mega Man titles back then, The Krion Conquest allows players to shoot directly upward, crouch to dodge enemies and projectiles, and shooting charged magic before the release of Mega Man 4 (December 6, 1991) and most later Mega Man titles that feature the charging &quot;Mega Buster&quot;.<br/><br/>Development<br/><br/>According to its designers, the development of the Magical Kids Doropie project took approximately 10 months to finish. The title was originally planned as a licensed game based on the 1986 anime, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, because the main designer wanted to. However, in Japan, the anime's copyrights were held by TV Tokyo. Therefore, the designers were unable to use it and decided to think up their own basic design until Doropie came about like that. Doropie's name is a remains of Dorothy in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz anime. The rest of Doropie's design didn't have any other Dorothy nor Oz references nor model in particular. But the character designer gave high priority to the point that quite a few people noticed in her design. Which is, Doropie having no eyelashes. Drawing eyelashing is a one of a expression method of a female character. But the character designer tried to make it cute without symbolic parts, and she was created. Her witch costume with a magical broom was the oldest heroine's design used in arcade and home video games back then.<br/><br/>Release differences<br/><br/>The North American version, The Krion Conquest, excluded some features from the Japanese version, Magical Kids Doropie, such as the removal of the &quot;Continue&quot; feature (making it more difficult), no lives to pick up, and no official English names for other characters (making its plot weaker). The most obvious difference between the original Japanese release and the North American version is the removal of every cut scene, except the introduction sequence and several redrawn in-game graphic elements. The circled hexagram seen at the end of each stage in the Japanese version was removed in the North American version due to Nintendo of America's rules not allowing religious beliefs in video games.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The Krion Conquest,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "86652": {"rpgdesigner": ["Wyn F.

The gameplay is fast paced and very arcadey; don't even think about hiding behind cover in this one folks! A unique new scoring system asks you to chain kills together in quick succession, building up your combo and grabbing you more points. The higher your combo the faster the bar ticks down, so it gets tougher and tougher to continue your deadly killing spree.<br/><br/>To keep your score high you'll need to burst into rooms of enemies with all guns blazing; the combo system pushing you further and further to your limit. However, don't take too long dispatching your target or your score will drop. If there are 30 bad guys in the level, that's potentially a 30x combo you could earn... practice, practice, practice!<br/><br/>The Club has been compared to all sorts of games in a variety of genres; is it a shooter, a racer, or a fighting game?

Never fear- there is of course no bookkeeping. At the start of each turn players figure out how much &quot;change&quot; they gather to fuel their activities for the turn. Simply marching off into arid and barren territory, even if it is strategically important, will leave you high and dry and out of supply- forcing a humiliating retreat. Players must plan carefully where they are going, how long they will be there, and what can go wrong; losing a battle will deplete your treasury as well as your army.<br/><br/>The opposing armies are different too, adding another element to strategy. The Franks have excellent cavalry and good foot troops, but not many skirmishers. The Greeks have an abundance of archers and ambushers as well as hard fighting regulars, and a corps of Turkish mercenaries (of dubious loyalty..). Both sides have to pick their battlefields and their timing must be near-perfect to pull off a game-winning battle.<br/><br/>The terrain is not the friendliest; each players base is green and lush, but you can't win by sitting still. Feint and counter-feint will be the order of the day, but when the time comes, you must strike. Sieges can be long, but sudden assaults costly. Greeks can set up ambushes while the Franks can attempt impetuous charges- either one can, if handled properly, bring about your opponent's overthrow.<br/><br/>This is the kind of game where there can be no wasted moves; everything is important, and dilly-dallying will hurt you sooner rather than later. This is a game that will lead to taut nerves and a lot of beard stroking!<br/><br/>Does it take long to play?<br/>That's entirely up to you.

In the game, the player moves through a map of an enchanted forest, battling monsters using their own summoned monsters through a puzzle-game battle based on PopCap's Bejeweled Twist. In these battles, the player rotates groups of four in a grid of gems to line up three or more jewels of the same color; when enough lines have been created damage is dealt to the enemy. Between battles, a story is told through a series of cutscenes, while the player and the summoned monsters gain experience and power using role-playing game elements.<br/><br/>The initial idea for the game was inspired by Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords, a 2007 video game which members of both companies were playing at the time. The game was proposed to Square Enix half-jokingly by PopCap's chief creative officer Jason Kapalka during a meeting between the two companies in 2007, and was released on the Xbox Live Arcade and on the Steam platform for Windows PCs by Square Enix on November 18, 2009. Gyromancer received a generally positive reception from reviewers. Critics took issue with perceived limited graphics, some aspects of the music, and a weak and confusing plot. Despite these flaws, in general they found the game to be fun and addictive, and to have a great deal of replay value.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Gyromancer&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "86782": {"poll": [], "name": "Doug Brown", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iPhone release"], "average": "2", "videogametheme": ["Detective / Mystery"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Avallon Alliance"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["iPhone"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Avallon Alliance"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Doug Brown is 46 levels of 24 relatively straightforward mini games.

In the mode of the first Indiana Jones movie, Aztec involves an intrepid, fedora-wearing explorer daring to plumb the depths of the Tomb of Quetzacoatl with the object of finding an invaluable jade idol that is supposedly hidden there.  It was given a respectable 5.79 out of 9 in the reader ratings published in the May-June 1983 issue of Computer Gaming World; in a review published in the same issue, Tom Jones wrote: &quot;The graphics are among the best that are now available on the market.&quot;<br/><br/>The large tomb that is to be explored is randomly created with each new game and consist of rooms divided into three on-screen vertical levels that connect horizontally with each other and are sometimes connected vertically by stairs.  One room usually has a staircase that descends to the level below, although it is also possible to blast through the floor using dynamite.  Armed with a pistol, machete, and the aforementioned dynamite, the player has to make his way past everything from Aztecs, snakes, and jaguars to strange tentacled monsters living deep in the bowels of the tomb.<br/><br/>But the most dangerous aspect of the Aztec god's tomb is the numerous traps, which can involve doors that lock behind you, ceilings that descend upon you, trapdoors that open beneath you, and water that fills up the room.  Once trapped, there is no cleverness that can save you, only dynamite will serve.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the tombs are liberally populated with chests and piles of trash, some of which inexplicably contain bullets, dynamite, and other useful items.  The movement controls have an unusual quirk in that jumping is faster than either walking or running, so players often preferred to move by repeated leaping from point to point rather than walking or running.<br/><br/>The graphics are quite detailed for its time and the random nature of the tombs allowed for a greater depth of gameplay than was common in 1982, although they also occasionally led to tombs that were impassible dead ends from the very first room.  There are eight difficulty levels which relate primarily to the number and aggressiveness of the tomb's denizens.<br/><br/>From the game<br/><br/>A few weeks ago a rumor surfaced that Professor G. Von Forster, noted tomb robber and archeologist, had discovered the entrance to the Tomb of Quetzalcoatal. <br/><br/>Inside this tomb there is a jade idol worth a fortune to any one who can find it and return alive.<br/><br/>You are now standing at the entrance to the tomb.<br/><br/>Before you enter remember that the tomb is guarded by terrible monsters and men without mercy.  Also, don't forget about Von Forster's nasty streak... He may have left some deadly surprises behind...<br/><br/>One more thing... the value of the idol is high right now but dropping steadily.  The faster you return under the greatest difficulty the larger your reward will be.  If you are good enough you could well become a millionaire...<br/><br/>Press any key...<br/><br/>"}, "86802": {"poll": [], "name": "Reforger '88", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US Apple II edition", "US Atari 8-Bit edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1117609.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Military", "War - Modern"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Strategic Simulations, Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Apple II", "Atari 8-bit family"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Strategic Simulations, Inc."], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1117609_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>A division-level wargame simulating an attack by the Warsaw Pact against NATO in Central Germany.<br/><br/>By Gary Grigsby<br/><br/>"}, "86803": {"poll": [], "name": "Mech Brigade", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US Apple II edition", "US Atari 8-Bit edition", "US C-64 edition", "US DOS edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1117582.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Military", "War - Modern"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Strategic Simulations, Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Apple II", "Atari 8-bit family", "Commodore 64", "DOS"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Strategic Simulations, Inc."], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1117582_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>Using a modified system of their Kampfgruppe game, Mech Brigade is SSI's platoon-level game of modern combat between Warsaw Pact and NATO units in Europe.<br/>Major equipment types are modeled for four countries, the US, Britain, West Germany and the USSR.<br/>Four scenarios as well as a random battle generator are included.<br/><br/>By Gary Grigsby<br/><br/>"}, "86804": {"rpgartist": ["Marlon deRivera", "J.

You can also use the core rules to simulate different genres (modern day, futuristic, pulp) simply by changing a few details. Often all you need to do is remove or restrict spellcasting classes and incorporate appropriate weapon and armor rules. Core Rulebook II contains rules for varying your campaign style to fit different time periods, including stats for handguns, grenades, futuristic ray-guns and so on. In some ways, this can actually be beneficial, because many superheroes use weapons common to fantasy settings, and many of the staple monsters of a fantasy bestiary would make perfect foes for super-powered heroes. We even include a new class in this book, the Specialist, which represents more mundane characters, who rely on knowledge, education, or training, like real-world people. With just the Fighter, Hero, Rogue, and Specialist, you can easily create heroic characters for the modern day, without needing anything beyond the core rules and this book.<br/><br/>However, you may choose to use another rule-set for your game. The most common superhero tales are set in the modern age or in the near future. For these games, we recommend that you use one of the modern d20 system games or settings that are available. You&rsquo;ll find d20 games and settings out there based on modern-day spycraft, on 1930s pulp, or on futuristic fantasy. Regardless of what ruleset you prefer to use, as long as it uses the d20 system rules as its basis, you should be easily able to add the rules from Four Color to Fantasy.<br/><br/>"}, "86805": {"poll": [], "name": "Battle Group (1986)", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US Apple II edition", "US C-64 edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1117506.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Military", "War - World War II"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Strategic Simulations, Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Apple II", "Commodore 64"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Strategic Simulations, Inc."], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1117506_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>Sister game to Kampfgruppe, Battle Group is a platoon-level simulation of the West European theater of WW2.

Played solo or between two players with roles of questioner (later on just Q) and interpreter (N). The interpreter leads the game and the questioner is the one receiving information about his/her home, work, personality, love, future and past.<br/><br/>Game-play - The game-play is divided into two phases 1) the card turning and 2) the pendulum swinging.<br/><br/>1) The card turning phase starts by picking up the proper coloured scarabs to the game board; the hair, eyes and favourite colour of the Q. The Q shuffles the purple 54 card deck and hands it over to N. N divides the deck into 3 separate decks of 18, 9 and 27 cards. The cards are dealt on the game board in the order 18, 27 and 9. The 18 cards are dealt on locations shown at the front page of the rule leaflet. The cards have 6 words in them and one of those is picked depending which is forming a pyramid with the game board (the black half of the pyramid on the left side of the card and the white half of the pyramid on the game board). While the cards are dealt, the N questions the Q if the word on the cards have any special meaning. The forming words are related to either home (1st vertical row), work (2nd), personality (3rd), love (4th), future (5th) or past (6th), depending which vertical row the cards are placed to. The 27 cards are then dealt on the game board (some restrictions apply, see the rule leaflet). Then the deck of 9 cards is used as a key to whole interpretation. At last the rest cards of the deck of 27 are used to check if something is being dominant on some areas of the Q's life. The final interpretations varies each playing time.<br/><br/>2) The pendulum swinging phase starts by placing the four decks of 28 cards onto the game board. The decks are placed on lower part of the game board, around the pyramid (letter A shown on the first page of the rule leaflet). The decks represents the areas of home, work, personality and love. The players decide one of the four categories and Q decides a question he/she wants to get answered related to that category. The transparent pyramid is placed on the game board and the pendulum is used for random number selection. There is numbers of 1-28 around the pyramid on the game board and the random pendulum swing decides the number of the chosen card. The N reads the text on the proper card to the Q. Same is repeated to other categories and questions.<br/><br/>Goal of the game - Interpreting the message gotten with cards and pendulum and gaining more self-consciousness.<br/><br/>The game includes:<br/><br/>1 game board<br/>1 transparent pyramid<br/>1 pendulum<br/>4 decks of cards (28 cards each)<br/>1 purple deck of cards (54 cards)<br/>2 bags including different coloured scarab buttons<br/>1 rule leaflet (4 pages)<br/><br/>From Finnish intro on the rule leaflet:<br/><br/>&quot;Karnak on kiehtovan j&auml;nnitt&auml;v&auml; ennustuspeli, jota voi pelata yksin tai yhdess&auml;.

Senator Weatherby was the senior Member of Parliament from Persephone and served in that position for over 15 years. The Senator is better known throughout the system as the &lsquo;Voice of the Browncoats.&rsquo; It was Senator Weatherby who successfully led the campaign to grant clemency to all the independent soldiers who fought against the Alliance in the War of Unification.

To do so, they throw a dice with the 3 different colors on it. A player must stop in a room of that color. When 2 players are in the same room, they have to switch presents.

And as with other forms of play, costumes and props are not a necessity. And yet it is more fun to play cops &amp; robbers, when the robbers look like robbers and the pistols say &quot;Bang!&quot;. And therein lies part of the explanation for the popularity of larp in Denmark. For we are a small country with nearly 5.5 million citizens, and of those more than 100,000 play larp. 15 years ago that number was below 1,000.<br/><br/>There are many reasons for this growth - not the least of them being the Lord of the Rings movies and the wave of Fantasy literature. But one of the most important reasons is, that the play has become more visual. Beautiful costumes and impressive settings can sometimes make you feel like you are part of a movie, and who doesn't dream of being the hero of one's own adventure? It was these reflections that laid the foundation for this, which is a collection of pictures from some of the larps we have done in 2008 - for children through the organization Junior Roleplaying Copenhagen and for the adults through The Roleplaying Factory organization. Because even though this is only the tip of the iceberg, when it comes to what Danish larp has to offer, it shows a little of the variety, diversity and enthusiasm that is hidden in the realm of imagination. So come with us through the universe of play.<br/><br/><br/>User Summary:<br/><br/>A book of larp photos. Nearly all pages contain a single large colour photo.

It's the beginning of the 22nd century and the Council of Galaxy faces a terrible threat: Vrangor, a scientist and escaped criminal has sent them an ultimatum: either the entire population of Terrapolis, capital city of Selenia is evacuated within 10 days and Selenia officially given to Vrangor, or the whole planet will be vaporized. Selenia being the only known source of khergol, the starship fuel, the Council sends an elite agent of the B.A.T. (&quot;Bureau des Affaires Temporelles&quot;, Bureau of Temporal Affairs) to Terrapolis. His mission, find Vrangor and his accomplice M&eacute;rigo and stop them.<br/><br/>B.A.T. is primarily an adventure game in which the player explores the huge city of Terrapolis (more than 1000 different locations) looking for clues and questioning the population, but it also features some RPG elements (the character has stats and skills and there is a level-up system), and several games inside the game (a 3D flight simulator, fighting sequences...). The game uses a point-and-click system for player interaction, and a feature called B.O.B., a microcomputer carried by the character on his wrist that keeps track of the character stats, translate the languages spoken by the many different aliens and robots present in the game, and can even be programmed by the player (a BASIC-like scripting language with few features). Another feature of the game is its open-endedness, as players can use many different strategies to complete the steps required to find M&eacute;rigo and Vrangor.<br/><br/>The game received a lot of praises when it was released, earning a &quot;Tilt d'or&quot; as best computer game of the year by French videogame magazine Tilt.<br/><br/>"}, "86864": {"rpgartist": ["Jesper Ejsing", "Jan Kj\u00e6r"], "rpgitemversion": ["Hardcover Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Magi & sv\u00e6rd", "rpgdesigner": ["Merlin P.

The game will involve dice-based combat, but will have multiple paths to victory for both the monsters and the humans, both fighting for different things.<br/><br/>One group will consist of six monsters: a cow; a crayfish; an asian carp; a gorilla; a bluegill; and two deep-tunnel sewer rats. The other group will consist of humans, plus humans with functions like workmen, fire fighters, police, nat'l guard, and some super-humans like Lara Croft and ninjas might appear during gameplay.<br/><br/>The game is driven foremost by the HO scale minis used in the game, and the plastic monsters. The toy value is what this &Uuml;ber-Ameritrash game is about.There will be multiple rule sets developed. Really, this game started with the toys, and a desire to improve an old game or two, while thematically morphing it into a game which featured downtown Milwaukee, WI USA.<br/><br/>At this point it's a prototype. The game is a homage to The Creature That Ate Sheboygan, borrows from Heorscape and Monsters Menace America, requires some D&amp;D features like THACO, and has lots of other options for tweaks and alt games.<br/><br/>The &quot;ha ha&quot; is deliberate in the name because of the twisted humor woven into the fabric of the game. The &quot;bronze fonz&quot; is on the map, and either side will get a bonus for either destroying it or simply rubbing it for good luck. Names for the creatures also have built-in humor:<br/><br/>Vince Gill: the bluegill who is also a Packer fan, but hates Milwaukeeans because of their fascination with the Friday Fish Fry. His desire is to crush restaurants which serve fish.<br/><br/>Son of Samson: the undead giant son of the most famous ex-resident of the Milwaukee Zoo, whose goal is to get to the top  of the Firstar/U.S. Bank tower and fling poo.<br/><br/>Carpie Diem: an asian carp, who seized headlines recently as the no.1 environmental enemy to Lake Michigan. He can jump across city blocks and smash things under his weight. Very easily distracted by the Ladybug Club, thinking they are asian lady beetles.<br/><br/>Holey Cow: a sympathizer with O'Leary's Chicago firestarter, this copycow is a Cubs fan and happens to breathe methane gas fires from her four stomachs, and out her nostrils. She's also capable of making massive cowpies which block city streets.<br/><br/>'Hood Ratz: a pair of residents from our failed Deep Tunnel system, these rodents are skaven mad *wink* and capable of chewing through even the five foot thick walls of the Fed Bldg. They're also attracted to hip-hop music.<br/><br/>Rebecca the Boiling Crayfish: (no relation to our new Lt. Governor of WI) she's looking for her crawdaddy in one of the restaurants that serve her brethren. The humans are in hot water this time.<br/><br/>The game narrative is such that an event has taken place that, combined with the deep tunnel sewer failure, has caused six local creatures to grow in size and terrorize Brewtown.<br/><br/>The Federal Bldg. is within the now quarantined section of Brewtown, and the goals of the monsters are many, but they have to achieve them before they are killed or the feds are able to call in the antidote. Meanwhile, the humans are to stay alive and kill monsters,while protecting buildings from fires, repairing blocked roads, and achieving other goals along the way.<br/><br/>There are several groups of humans:<br/><br/>Firefighters: complete with a new ladder truck, these six individuals have axes and hoses in hand *wink* to face any challenge.<br/><br/>Police: one car (Milwaukee police are grossly underfunded) and a handful of officers help with attacks, rescue civilians, and keep the peace among the surviving humans.<br/><br/>National Guard: these weekend warriors with five tanks were setting up for maneuvers downtown, ending in at the Veterans Memorial nearby when this hit. They've not got much live ammo with them for this reason, but they have plenty of rubber bullets of all sizes-and they look scary as hell. The can fly in one helicopter from General Mitchell Airport in a couple of rounds, and it will have the firepower they need, but the rest of the military is on furlough.<br/><br/>Municipal Construction: several men on a job site with a huge dump truck, a CAT backhoe, and two CAT scoopshovels. They're tough enough to fight the monsters on their own with their equipment and they're experts at &quot;catcalls&quot;.<br/><br/>Waste Management: one unmanned truck full of Milwaukee's finest refuse, abandoned.<br/><br/>Superhumans: activated at different times in the game when humans accomplish certain goals: a Lara Croft lookalike, with the guns to prove it; a ninja; two advanced swordplay students from the T'ai Chi Ch'uan center of Milwakee, and their leader Mike. Mike's wearing a Yoda costume he found at the Milwaukee Film office, and his mastery of push hands gives him the equivalent of the &quot;force push&quot;. He hopes the creatures watched the trilogy, and fear him...<br/><br/>The two collaborative groups struggle until the game ends for a variety of reasons.

McClellan has formed and trained a large army, transported it by sea in an outflanking maneuver, marched it to the gates of the Confederate capital, and is poised to capture the city and probably bring an end to the rebellion.  On the Confederate side Lee has taken over the Army after Johnston was wounded.  Unlike Johnston, who was content to fight a largely defensive campaign, Lee gathered every unit he could get his hands on and launched his own offensive.  The Union had placed its army in an awkward position, with one corps north of Chickahominy River and the rest south of it.  Lee&rsquo;s plan, and the position of the units when the game starts, was to crush the Union Corps and then drive the rest of McClellan&rsquo;s army from the capital, destroying as much of it as he possible could.  With that accomplished he would have a free hand to turn north.<br/><br/>The system is a simplified version of two games, the last area-impulse Avalon Hill published, Breakout: Normandy, and MMP's Monty's Gamble: Market Garden.<br/><br/>The game features leaders who are rated for initiative and combat effectiveness. Another mechanism in the game is the &ldquo;advantage&rdquo; marker which can be traded to the opponent to do things like rally, conduct a combined assault, declare a heroic defense that turns a success into a stalemate, or receive additional replacements.<br/><br/>The victory conditions are based on territorial control.  For the Union that was Richmond.  For the Confederacy that was the Union supply heads &ndash; White House Landing and Harrison&rsquo;s Landing &ndash; and Malvern Hill.

In particularly dangerous swamps, travelers go so far as to create travelers shrines to the aegire, though the aegire have no interest in such recognition.<br/><br/>The select few druids, rangers and sages who know the truth about the aegire are silent when queried. Even they do not know the reason why this shortlived race provides aid, though a few legends exist. The most common tells of druids from an extinct race that protected the swamp. According to the legend, the druids gave up the last vestiges of their racial heritage to defend the swamp. Whether this story is true or not may never be known. However, any druid or ranger who respects life can be comfortable knowing they have allies in the shadows of the swamp.<br/><br/>"}, "86964": {"rpgartist": ["LAV Pech-Sambour"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Alratheen", "rpgdesigner": ["Rodney West"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic847274.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgproducer": ["Rodney West"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Primal Urge Games"], "average": "0", "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Emerging Forms"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic847274_t.jpg", "description": "From Overview:<br/><br/>They are errant thoughts of Terminus.
