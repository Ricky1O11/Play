Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.<br/><br/>As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in and effort to exploit low or high market demands.<br/><br/>Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):<br/><br/>1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.<br/>2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.<br/>3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.<br/>4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.<br/>5) Loan - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:<br/><br/>6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)<br/><br/>The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.<br/><br/>Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.<br/><br/>Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.<br/><br/>New &quot;Sell&quot; system<br/><br/>Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.<br/><br/>Birmingham features three all-new industry types:<br/><br/>Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.<br/><br/>Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.<br/><br/>Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.<br/><br/>Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to $8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham is a finely brewed sequel to one of history's most industrial economic games. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor. Many of the tried and true strategies of the original are no longer as powerful as they once were, and other interesting new strategies are waiting for you to discover.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "8.735", "name": "Brass: Birmingham", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Route/Network Building"], "age": "14", "usersrated": "20", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Cities: Birmingham (UK)", "Country: England"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap; Fugitive; Valeria Card Kingdoms; Veggie Garden", "Episode 49 :: Vast Review + Watch it Played &amp; The Secret Cabal"]}, "224518": {"rpgdesigner": ["Malcolm Wolter"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version 1.0"], "statistics": [], "name": "Map Folio: Early Phase", "rpgartist": ["Malcolm Wolter"], "rpgproducer": ["Malcolm Wolter"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3489721.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Arthurian Legends"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Arthurian)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Nocturnal Media"], "rpg": ["Pendragon (1st - 5th Editions)"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3489721_t.png", "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>Here be Pendragons...<br/><br/>Ancient Britain is a land like no other.

Clever use of these pieces can tip the balance to your side and name you the ultimate victor!<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to make the most and/or biggest triangles with the pieces available to earn the most points.  Every newly formed triangle adds to your score.  However, there is one rule:  You cannot place pieces where the same colored lines overlap.<br/><br/>There are four different ways to play Triangle Maker:<br/><br/>1. Card Game<br/><br/>a. Shuffle the cards<br/>b. When it is your turn, draw the first card and place the corresponding piece onto the board. (Earn tokens based on the number or size of the triangle<samp> made)<br/>c. You can use either of the movable pieces during your turn instead of drawing your next card.<br/>d. Whoever gets the most points wins!<br/><br/>2. Strategy Card Game<br/><br/>a.

(Earn tokens based on the number or size of the triangle<samp> made)<br/>c. During the next turns, remember to draw a card to replace the one used and then repeat the above step.<br/>d.

While keeping only the movable pieces, transfer all your pieces to another player.<br/>b. When it is your turn, the other player will choose the piece he/she wants you to place onto the board.

You and your teammates take on the roles of 4 different emergency room staff members of James Young Memorial Hospital, a failing medical center on the verge of being shut down by a government agency. You only have until the end of your shift to prove to them that the hospital deserves to stay open.<br/><br/>To accomplish this, players will need to coordinate care and prioritize which patients need to receive care first and which can wait until a later turn. Every round, patients will be added to the emergency room via ambulance or private vehicle with various conditions, needs, and risks. Patients with more critical conditions such as a heart attack or stroke have the risk of death, while others with more minor injuries, like an elbow sprain or knee pain may leave the ER against medical advice, if they don't receive treatment quick enough. Unexpected events such as an external disaster, code blue, and patients removing their IVs may also occur, causing more problems for the staff to deal with.<br/><br/>There are 3 ways to lose the game, and only one way to win. The players will lose if they are unable to place an incoming patient into one of 12 rooms, if 3 patients expire, or if they have not earned enough points from patient discharges to demonstrate to the agency that the hospital is worth staying open.

The concept of the game is rather simple. The company you work for, has suddenly been having problems with all of its production machines. One of your fellow employees, (players) has been tampering with the machines, &quot;After Hours&quot;. The problem is, no one seems to knows who it is, because every employee seems has an alibi. There for, the Board of Directors, (The Narrator(s)), have decided that one employee will be fired during each &quot;Day Shift&quot; via a 60% majority Employee vote, until the machines are no longer being tampered with. To help facilitate this, a member of local law enforcement (Undercover Cop)and the FBI (in larger games of over 15 players), have secretly joined the ranks of rest of the employees. Their goal, is to help weed out the real problem person; The elusive The Monkey Wrench. However, this individual has an edge: Once per &quot;After hours&quot; round, they can secretly convert one of the other employee towards their goal, and make them into a fellow Monkey Wrench. However, both the Police Officer, and FBI can also once per &quot;After hours&quot; round, secretly &ldquo;Fire&rdquo; or &quot;Arrest&quot; one employee, thwarting their dastardly goals. While the rest of the employees, can all through social deduction, vote during the &quot;Day shift&quot; round, to have 1 of their fellow employees (Players), removed from game. So its up to you fellow employee&hellip;<br/><br/>Will you side with the Monkey Wrench and take down the company? Will you help the Corporate Security to weed out the problem person? Or... are you secretly the Monkey Wrench, all along?<br/><br/>General game play:<br/>Each player is given 3 cards at the beginning of the game:<br/><br/>1 - &quot;Day shift&quot; card, which denotes their public role within the company, that every other player is completely aware of. This card reflects that players normal operations within the company during the day, while they are working. It further operates as  each players &quot;titled&quot; position within a standard normal office environment. Each titled position, is sometimes granted certain abilities, that are usually made public to all players in play, during the &quot;Day shift&quot; phase.<br/><br/>1 - &quot;After hours&quot; card. which designates the given players roles, duties and Private activities when they are not at work, during the &quot;After hours&quot; phase of the game. During this phase of game play, some players are lumber into various secret shadow groups, that operate in secret. Some of them are trying to resolve the crime within the company. Others are trying to ruin the company, by either overthrowing it (Such as the Monkey Wrench), or corrupting the internal operations of the company. While others yet still, have absolutely little value, or influence upon the companies operations, and function as nothing more than benign red herrings, to offset the various groups investigations.<br/><br/>Lastly, the 3rd card, is the &quot;Vote/ Fire&quot; card. Operates as each individual players ability to either cast a vote against one person they believe should be removed from game, on their &quot;Current player&quot; turn (Fire side of the card), or support another players choice of someone that they believe should be removed from play, (The &quot;Vote&quot; side of the card).<br/><br/><br/><br/>Average game time: <br/>15 minutes for a 7 to 10 person game<br/>30 minutes for a 10 to 15 person game<br/>45 minutes for a 15 to 20 person game<br/>60 minutes for a 20 to 30 person gameIntended age of play:<br/>This game is intended for persons 16 years or older. However, the production website says &quot;18&quot;, only because the options, are 12 or 18. However, the content that is questionable, within the game, is sexually suggestive adult humor, found within 4 &quot;After hours&quot; cards. Which are not essential for general game play, and may be removed as needed for smaller games, of less than 25 persons playing.<br/><br/>Number of players:<br/>A basic game consists of at least 7 to 10 players:<br/>Advanced games can handle 11 to 33 players.<br/><br/>Please note, that for every 10 &quot;Employee&quot; players in the game, 1 &quot;Board member&quot; (Narrator), will be needed.<br/><br/>"}, "224635": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Mike Elliott", "Satoshi Nakamura", "Rudy Ng"], "poll": [], "name": "Dragoborne: Rise to Supremacy", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2017", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3492663_t.png", "average": "8.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Bushiroad South East Asia Pte.

The player with the best value collects all the cards.<br/><br/>2) GeoMundi Double (2 players)<br/>This is played like GeoMundi, but both players choose a category.

Each player may then select any of their cards to use in the battle. Best value in the category wins the cards.<br/><br/>4) Handicap (4+ players on 2+ teams)<br/>Teams take turns. One player on one team picks a card and then must give clues so that their team can guess the name of the country. The clue provider may not use any of the words on the card or give clues related to the country name, although rhymes are allowed.<br/><br/>5) Touch! (2+ players)<br/>This game is similar to Slap Jack. Each player turns over a card on their turn.

Or the players can only use the capital city as the clue and the players must guess the country name.<br/><br/>9) Take Your Pick (2+ players)<br/>This is played like Clue-in but the clue giver draws two cards, states the name of each country, and chooses a category. The players must guess which country has the better value or if they match.<br/><br/>10) Map-it<br/>This is played like Clue-in.

Armed with only your wits and a list of antidote ingredients, you must battle the wilds, monsters, and your fellow players to be the first to return to the apothecary with the items you need.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/>&bull; 1 Game Board<br/>&bull; 6 Wooden Colored Pawns<br/>&bull; 6 Wooden Colored Breath Trackers<br/>&bull; 6 Sets of 10 Ingredient Cards (60 total)<br/>&bull; 50 Monster Cards<br/>&bull; 18 Meddling Cards<br/>&bull; 10 Loot Cards<br/>&bull; 8 Drop Cards<br/>&bull; 1 10-Sided Battle Die<br/>&bull; 1 6-Sided Movement Die<br/>&bull; 1 Wooden Debris Token<br/><br/>Preparing the Game:<br/>Each player selects a colored pawn, the corresponding breath-tracker token, and the corresponding deck of ten Ingredient Cards. Players place their pawns on the Apothecary&rsquo;s hut in the center of the board and place their breath-tracker tokens on the number 50 on the breath tracker.<br/><br/>Next, players shuffle their ten Ingredient Cards and randomly select four ingredients. These will represent the ingredients they will need to collect for their unique antidotes. Players will place their four Ingredient Cards on the table in front of them face-up with the black vial at the top. Each player&rsquo;s remaining six Ingredient Cards can be returned to the box.<br/><br/>Players are dealt Meddling cards based on the number of players:<br/>&bull; In a game with two players, five Meddling Cards are distributed to each player.<br/>&bull; In a game with three players, four Meddling Cards are distributed to each player.<br/>&bull; In a game with four or more players, three Meddling Cards are distributed to each player.<br/>Meddling Cards are dealt face-down and go into the player&rsquo;s hand.<br/><br/>Rules &amp; Gameplay:<br/>Health:<br/>Each player starts with 50 &ldquo;breaths.&rdquo; Every time a player rolls the 6-sided movement die or a 10-sided battle die, he/she loses a breath and gets one step closer to expiring. All players&rsquo; breaths are tracked around the edges of the board on the breath tracker grid. If any player is reduced to zero breaths, that player expires and is out of the game.<br/><br/><br/>     Tip: Select one player at the start of the game to manage the breath tracker.<br/>         Note: Even with bonuses, no player may have more than 50 breaths at any point during the game.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Movement:<br/>Each player will start his/her turn rolling the 6-sided movement die to determine how many spaces to move on the board. That player may choose any path and may move spaces forward and/or backward in any direction, even in the same turn.<br/><br/><br/>     Remember: Each time a player rolls the 6-sided movement die, he/she loses a breath on the breath tracker!<br/><br/><br/>Fighting a Monster:<br/>A Monster fight is triggered when a player approaches a Monster Deck and lands on a red space leading to the Monster Deck. However, if a player lands on a red space while traveling away from a Monster Deck, no Monster fight is triggered. In other words, if traveling in the same direction as the red arrow is pointing, you enter combat; if traveling in the opposite direction of the arrow, no combat is triggered.<br/><br/>When a Monster fight is triggered, a player flips the top card of the Monster Deck and must defeat the revealed Monster before moving on&hellip; or die trying. Players may also retreat and reverse direction if they have any movements left from their movement roll.<br/><br/>The Monster&rsquo;s level is listed at the top of the Monster Card.<br/><br/>To defeat the Monster, a player must roll the 10-sided battle die and get a number that is equal to or higher than the Monster&rsquo;s level. The player rolls until the Monster is defeated or until he/she decides to retreat. Once a Monster is defeated, it is put in a discard pile on the table.<br/><br/>Bonuses &amp; Drops:<br/>Some high-level Monsters, though difficult to beat, may offer helpful bonuses or valuable drop items that can greatly assist a player. Bonuses and drops are listed at the bottom of high-level Monster&rsquo;s cards. Some drops benefit the player for the remainder of the game while others are used once and then discarded.<br/><br/>Meddling:<br/>Meddling Cards can be used at any point during the game to hinder fellow players from advancing. Meddling Cards can also be traded in at any time to regain five breaths on the breath tracker. Once a Meddling Card is used or traded in, it is discarded from the game.<br/><br/>Collecting Loot and Ingredients:<br/>To collect an ingredient, a player must land on the corresponding starred green space on the board. Once an ingredient is collected, the player flips his/her corresponding Ingredient Card.<br/><br/>To collect loot, a player must land on the starred yellow space that abuts it. If a player gets a Loot Card, it is added to his/her hand and may be used at any time. Like drops, Some Loot Cards give players temporary abilities while others award advantages.<br/><br/>Dueling:<br/>During a player&rsquo;s turn, if he/she ever occupies the same space as another player, then he/she may challenge that player to a duel. A player can only challenge another player to a duel when that other player has an ingredient that the challenger still needs.<br/><br/>During the duel, each player rolls the 10-sided battle die. Whoever has the highest roll wins, and in case of a tie, the advantage goes to the challenged player. If the challenger wins the duel, he/she takes the needed ingredient item from the challenged player, who now has to either go back and get the ingredient again or give chase to get it back. If the challenged player wins, then the challenger automatically loses 5 breaths and cannot duel that player again this turn.<br/><br/>Note: Players may use any applicable Drop Cards or Loot Cards during their duels.<br/>Looting:<br/>If a player runs out of breath, his/her pawn is left on the spot of expiration. Each other player may loot the body if they ever occupy the same space as the expired player&rsquo;s pawn. A player may only loot an expired pawn once per turn and only for needed ingredient items or unused or perpetual drop or Loot Cards.<br/><br/>Ending the Game:<br/>The first player to return to the Apothecary&rsquo;s hut center of the board with all of the necessary ingredients for his/her antidote is victorious! Sometimes, though, all players expire and the game wins!<br/><br/>"}, "224657": {"rpgdesigner": ["Craig Judd"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version 1.1"], "statistics": [], "name": "PowerFrame Fantasy Characters", "rpgartist": ["Craig Judd"], "rpgproducer": ["Craig Judd"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3493810.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["PowerFrame Games"], "rpg": ["PowerFrame Roleplaying System"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3493810_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Fantasy Characters gets you straight into the action with a selection of ready-made starting characters, complete with equipment and spell selections!

After all, real Glory comes from the adoration of the people!<br/><br/>Between the unpredictable attacks, Heroes have downtime to visit the bustle of the City and buy new weapons, learn new abilities, and replenish their elemental energies in preparation for battle.<br/><br/>The Soothseers foretell that the Heroes will vanquish the Colossus after five grueling battles. Though all contribute, only the Hero with the most Glory in both deeds and renown can take credit for the Deathblow and be declared Savior of the City!<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Colossal Deathblow is a rules-light, Euro-style, majority control game with unique placement eligibility mechanisms. There are three main phases in each of the its five rounds.<br/><br/>First, while preparing for the Colossus attack during each round (and while the outcome of each battle is still uncertain), players must make hard choices about which of the majority-control areas on the board they might want to use in a later phase.<br/><br/>Second, during the attack, players secretly choose which vulnerability of the Colossus to target using one of their weapons, and which type and how much elemental energy to use to boost the damage. Players are then ranked according to the amount of overall damage they do to the Colossus. The player who does the most damage goes first during the next phase, but also becomes a target when the Colossus strikes back.<br/><br/>Finally, after the battle, players must decide where to place popularity tokens from their limited supply, subject to their eligibility decided earlier. Tokens represent renown, which is converted to VPs (Glory) via majority control at the end of the game.<br/><br/>While players can choose to place as many or as few tokens as they wish during a round, choices are final and there is a hard limit to the number of tokens they can place over the course of the game. Deciding when to double-down to gain a majority and when to conserve tokens are major considerations during each round.<br/><br/>The game is medium-weight and plays in 75-120 minutes, and (despite the impression the name might give) has minimal direct player interaction. It thematically combines the deliciously agonizing choices of classic area control and hand management games (El Grande, Auction 2002) with resource management and simultaneous action selection mechanisms.<br/><br/>"}, "224688": {"average": "0", "videogamebg": ["Jaipur"], "name": "Jaipur", "videogamemode": ["Asynchronous Multiplayer", "Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android edition", "iOS edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3565959.png", "videogametheme": ["Card / Casino Games"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Asmodee Digital"], "videogamegenre": ["Classic Games"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone"], "poll": [], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Asmodee Digital"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3565959_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/>The digital version of the wildly popular 2 player card game Jaipur<br/><br/>"}, "224689": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version 2.2"], "poll": [], "name": "Wardrow's Feat Compendium", "rpgartist": ["Michael Kormack", "Todd Lockwood", "Anthony Palumbo"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3495045.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3495045_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>This is a list of homebrew feats that try my playgroup uses, plus many that I came up with.

This green menace is not only stronger than their human counterparts, but they also tend to gather into massive hordes that ambush the survivors when they least expect it. Uncover the many surprises the Green Horde has in store for you!<br/><br/>They were a brave people, living on the edge of the Orcish lands?on the Western frontier. It was a rough country, where nature grows wild, and the weather can change at a moment&rsquo;s notice. They fought with the brutish Orcs many times, withstanding raids on their villages and fields. Never once, in all those battles, did they consider leaving for safer regions of the world. This was their land, their ancestor&rsquo;s land. Generations had grown up in its green forests and fields, taking what the earth gave them, and defending what was theirs. But the Orcs were relentless, becoming bolder and bolder as time went on.<br/><br/>When the plague hit, it wasn&rsquo;t long before the Orcs became infected. All it took was one bite, and the sickness spread through their ranks like wildfire. What the plague robbed the Orcs of in intelligence, agency, and personality, it replaced with a single-minded goal: destroy the living and feast on their flesh. The Orcs band together now, a pack, a horde. They travel the countryside, attacking the towns they come across, but now stealing some crops or a cow or two doesn&rsquo;t suffice. They&rsquo;re not satisfied until the people of the village are dead... or perhaps worse, undead.<br/><br/>Zombicide: Green Horde is coming to Kickstarter on May 30. It is the standalone sequel to Zombicide: Black Plague. Set in the same medieval era, players will take on the role of Survivors looking to defeat the shuffling, undead menace by any means possible.<br/><br/>In Green Horde, up to six players can join the battle for survival. They&rsquo;ll combine forces and work cooperatively to accomplish their goals, and against all odds, stay alive. Fans of the Zombicide series have become familiar with the Walkers, Runners, Fatties, and Abominations that shuffle around, looking for victims. But the creatures they will face are not just zombie humans, they&rsquo;re zombie orcs! The Survivors will have to gear up with a wide variety of medieval equipment if they hope to outlast these fearsome foes. Zombie Orcs are stronger than the classic zombie and represent a stiffer challenge to even seasoned undead-hunting veterans.<br/><br/>Orc Walkers used to be the grunt warriors of the Orcish tribes. Their intelligence is gone, but they retain their strength and ferocity in battle. Orc Fatties were the real strength of the tribes. Tougher than even the average Orc, battles with them should not be entered into lightly. The Runners in Zombicide: Green Horde were once goblins, the smaller cousins of Orcs. They are fast, unpredictable, and have retained their instincts for survival. Not much is known about the origins of the Orcish Abominations. However, there are two things that are certain: you&rsquo;ll need to have a solid plan to destroy them, and you&rsquo;ll need an escape route. As the different zombies are dispatched, the Survivors will earn experience points, unlocking abilities and better preparing them for the challenges they will face.<br/><br/>A new challenge for the Survivors is the Horde. It represents a growing group of Orc zombies that are ready to enter the board in an unexpected location and ambush the Survivors. As zombie cards with the Horde symbol are drawn, one extra zombie miniature of the same type is set aside, collectively forming the Horde. They will be locked into place until an &ldquo;Enter the Horde!&rdquo; card is drawn, spawning the Horde on the board. Any Survivor caught on their own near this roving menace would best beat a hasty retreat.<br/><br/>With such menacing new foes, the Survivors are going to have their hands full dealing with the Green Horde. Luckily, they&rsquo;ll have some awesome new weapons and spells on their side to help combat the rotting masses. Things like the Lava Burst, the Norse Sword, and the Bone Kukri will all be helpful when hacking through a pack of the undead. Oh, and if they should gather together too tightly, the Survivors can always hit them with the catapult...(did we not mention the catapult?).<br/><br/>Zombicide: Green Horde includes ten new challenging quests, featuring some of the toughest scenarios a Survivor has ever had to face. With new terrain, like ledges and water holes, and the ever-present threat of the Green Horde making an appearance, the team will have to plan their routes carefully. Sometimes avoiding trouble is better than facing it head on! Zombicide: Green Horde is the next chapter in the ever-evolving world of Zombicide. There&rsquo;s no rest for the Survivors if they hope to battle their way to a new hope and a new beginning.<br/><br/>Fans of the series will delight in the new challenges placed in front of them, but Zombicide: Green Horde is also a great introduction to the series. Even new players will be firing Spiked Bows or Telekinetic Blasts at the enemy in no time.<br/><br/>Strap on your armor, sharpen your sword, and prepare for adventure. Zombicide: Green Horde is coming to Kickstarter on May 30, and only the brave need apply.<br/><br/>"}, "224714": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Rocky Heckman", "Stefanie Heckman"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Troll Bridge", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement", "Secret Unit Deployment"], "yearpublished": "2017", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3533885_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Daniel Salcido"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Cravon Studios"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3533885.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Fantasy"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>In Troll Bridge you play an intrepid messenger competing against other messengers to deliver their messages across a very unstable, Troll-infested bridge. But these aren't your normal Trolls, that would be boring.<br/><br/>There are two types of Trolls, Ug Trolls which aren't all that smart and would rather smash the bridge and create holes to avoid than get into any kind of friendly small talk. Then there are their smarter counterparts, the Tollosophers which want to chit chat and you have to answer their questions to pass.<br/><br/>Along the way you can collect Treasure that can help you fight Ug Trolls, hinder your opponents, patch the bridge, and even swap Ug Trolls for Trollosophers and many other interesting and sometimes useful things.<br/><br/>Just make sure not to die along the way.<br/><br/>Players take turns moving their messengers along the bridge one space at a time. Each space reveals a tile that indicates if they fight an Ug Troll, a Trollosopher, or if they have found some treasure and possibly nothing, which grants an extra move.<br/><br/>Players must navigate around holes in the bridge created by Ug Trolls. They can risk death by jumping over a hole and hoping they don't fall through the rickety bridge on the other side. In some cases this may make sections unpassable and players will have to go around those sections.<br/><br/>Defeating the Ug Trolls is determined by dice roll to damage the Ug Trolls.  Each turn the Ug Troll remains, the player cannot advance and he knocks out sections of bridge. Defeating a Trollosopher is done by successfully answering their trivia questions. While they remain, they just keep a player from advancing.<br/><br/>Play continues until one player successfully reaches the end of the bridge. Once that happens, the game is over and the winner is determined by score. Players score points for finishing first, and for each Troll defeated as well as any treasure they have remaining.<br/><br/>"}, "224715": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3503242.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Morgan Hubbart"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2017", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Morgan Hubbart", "Becky Young"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Uber Dungeon"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3503242_t.png", "minplaytime": "5", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Comic Book / Strip", "Humor"], "description": "Goblins: Ready Set Destroy is a fast paced card game for 2-4 players, or 2-6 players with the addition of a second deck.

With the improvised storytelling of a roleplaying game and the pick-up-and-play nature of a card game, you can jump right into things and tell a great story together over the space of a few hours.<br/><br/>The deck includes 5 characters: the naive and heroic Apprentice, the wily and demonic Bound Servant, the ancient and wise Hermit, the hardened and perceptive Inquisitor, and the reckless and dangerous Fringe Occultist. Players each pick a character and customise them by choosing ability cards, relationships with the other characters, and cosmetic details (name, appearance, personality etc). Then the group drafts Goals and Assets for each character - these are the objectives they're trying to achieve, and the resources they have to try to do that.<br/><br/>Play then starts, with each player taking a turn to play through a short scene of their character working towards their goal while the other characters help, interfere, or push their own agendas. Within scenes, characters can activate special abilities to do things like revealing an incredibly expensive possession, providing another character with a refreshing cocktail, or fixing someone with an imperious gaze that forces them to reveal their secrets. These are all paid for with a limited pool of tokens, meaning players must carefully plan when they use their abilities to guide the story in their preferred direction.<br/><br/>As characters make progress on their goals they accumulate special tokens they can cash in for an all-or-nothing attempt to complete the goal. Once someone has completed all their goals, the game wraps up with an epilogue showing how things worked out for each character.<br/><br/>User Note: this item also has an RPG item entry: Wizards Aren't Gentlemen<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "150", "name": "Wizards Aren't Gentlemen", "playingtime": "150", "boardgamemechanic": ["Acting", "Co-operative Play", "Hand Management", "Role Playing", "Storytelling", "Variable Player Powers"], "average": "8", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "224743": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version 1.0"], "poll": [], "name": "Hartkiller's Horn", "rpgdesigner": ["Greg Marks"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3495561.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Forgotten Realms"], "rpgproducer": ["Claire Hoffman", "Adam Lee", "Christopher Lindsay", "Mike Mearls", "Matthew Sernett", "Travis R.

This caused much of the past cards to get bluelining, which means that even though Drizz't Do'Urden doesn't say Elf(Drow), he still is.  Another major concept never fully followed up on was cards that were effectively based on the time of day outside of the game (such as various wizards of the _____ robes, Dagger of Night (#65), and Time Shift: spells) .  We also had the first time we use what is now the standard chase configuration (1 chase per 4 packs).  This gave TSR many headaches, as apperently the boxes were poorly labeled and many purchasers thought that it was a chase a pack.  Finally, the last big advance that this set gave us swimmers, who were champions that could attack realms other than the lead one if the realm showed coastline, and earthwalkers, champions who could attack any realm regardless of position (but not restrictions).

Artifacts were made for many worlds that had few, rule cards had a rarity less than full rares, we found holdings for any world, all champions got better powers, and Dark Sun finally had enough realms to be a viable theme.  This was also the first of two sets that had only 20 chase instead of 25.  However, it was also a set that started using only 1 rare per pack.

In this set, we saw two new types of cards used: Psionicists and Psionic Power Cards.  There always mixed reviews of psionicist due to this set.  Some thought (for some unknown reason to me) they were way too powerful.  The rest of us thought they still were highly underpowered compaired to wizard spells.

For instance, all realms in this booster have the back printed upside down, being very reminicent of many 1st edition realms.  Another key mistake they made is that all the wizards in the set had the wizard spell icon.  The other big thing this set gave Spellfire was Unarmed Combat Cards, in this case, only useable by heroes.  Also, we had the first artifacts that were attached not by world, but by champion type.

She is a member of an elite group of scientists, chosen to embark on one of the most critical missions ever conceived on Earth. Now Rachel is alone, orbiting an unknown planet. Her only companions are J.U.L.I.A., the space probe&rsquo;s artificial intelligence and Mobot, a huge reconnaissance robot. Together, this unlikely trio will explore the mysteries of this solar system. But are they prepared for what they will find?<br/><br/>Story<br/><br/>After countless years of careful space observation, the enormous telescope Chandra 17 suddenly locates a solar system quite similar to our own. As all earthly observatories turned their attention towards this new discovery, a signal of artificial origin is detected from deep within the system.<br/><br/>Reaction was immediate and a mission plan was conceived. No expense was spared in the construction of a massive space probe. It was designed and equipped to be ideally suited for the ultimate challenge: to meet and study extraterrestrial sentient life-forms. Equal care was taken with the crew. Only the most prominent scientists were selected and trained to ideally represent planet Earth. Everything was perfectly planned and success was certain. Yet somehow, everything has gone terribly wrong&hellip;<br/><br/>Now, imagine being jolted awake by an emergency alarm. As your surroundings come into focus, you realize you were deep in cryogenic sleep on a vast space probe. But why you are there is an elusive memory. Disoriented, you rush to the control room searching for answers. Once there you learn from the ship&rsquo;s AI that not only have you been asleep for decades, but you are also the last surviving member of the probe&rsquo;s crew.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, the probe is severely damaged by a disastrous impact with a passing meteoroid swarm. First, you must make repairs. Not only is your own survival at stake, but you need to find out what happened to the crew and why you alone survived.<br/><br/>Are you prepared to:<br/><br/><br/>     step into the spacesuit of Rachel Manners and find out why she was the sole survivor of this ill-fated expedition?<br/>     utilize an ingenious MOBOT &ndash; a mobile robot designed for planetary exploration to investigate this solar system and all its wonders?<br/>     solve the mystery of the mission&rsquo;s failure and locate the missing crew?<br/>     travel to six unique planets and uncover their secrets?<br/>     solve puzzles, gather clues and communicate with the most temperamental artificial intelligence ever designed?<br/>     Are you prepared for&hellip; J.U.L.I.A.<br/><br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>J.U.L.I.A.

You can use the Go board or play with a set of stones (checkers) on any flat surface. The goal of the game is to deprive the opponent of all available moves. To do this, you need to block all the stones of the opposite color. In this game there is no war or direct confrontation of pieces. All the stones are interconnected and constantly depend on each other. During the game, the position passes through various metamorphoses and, having exhausted all its energy, freezes as a result. This game is inspired by the ancient philosophy of the Far East...<br/><br/>You can play with:<br/><br/>16 stones - If you prefer quick tactical games. <br/>36 stones - If you like the balance of tactics and strategy. <br/>64 stones - If you have a worthy opponent and a lot of time.<br/><br/>Average game length - 100-110 plies (with 36 stones). Strategy is more important than tactics. The first player has no advantages. The game can begin with any compact arrangement of stones. You can play with a handicap, if necessary. It is possible to eliminate draws by changing one rule. Connectedness of the position and irreversibility of the game is the basis of krona.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Each player has an allocated color, Black and White. Players alternate turns, starting with Black. The stones must all stay connected in a single group. You cannot pick up a stone to move if doing so disconnects the remaining stones, even if they would be reconnected after putting the stone into its new location. Each stone always has neighbors. Their number can be from 1 to 8. Stones are considered to be neighbors if they stand on the nearby squares. Neighbors are divided into two types - diagonal and orthogonal. The stone can be moved to any empty square, where the number of neighbors are less than it is now. Their color does not matter. The stone can also be moved to any empty square, where the number of neighbors does not change, but orthogonal ones among them become less. The game ends when one of the players has no legal moves on his turn. If his opponent also has no moves it's a draw. If he has any move, he wins the game. In this case, the winner does as many moves as he can and earns one point for each move.<br/><br/>"}, "224803": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Craig Duncan"], "poll": [], "name": "Daisy Chain", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Building"], "yearpublished": "2017", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "3", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3503793_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3503793.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Children's Game", "Farming", "Print & Play"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Basic idea: In Daisy Chain, players conduct a &quot;Battle of the Garden Paths.&quot;  Players aim to place paving stones of their color into a garden courtyard in order to construct a path leading to more flowers than any of their opponent's garden paths.<br/><br/>Daisy Chain is played on a hexagonal grid surrounded by flowers.

Discovery can be played as a solitary game or with up to 9 players, between humans only or with automatons (virtual players), in teams or individually, with simple fast 5-mins games or complex longer ones (&gt;1hr). Adults and children, beginners and experts, all can play together by adjusting the game difficulty and relative player strength.<br/><br/>In Discovery Simple, each player receives 5 cards and plays in turn. During your turn you can place one or more cards from your hand. If you don't, you must discard one card. You can also liberate cards from other players&rsquo; discards (but not from your own). The game ends when a player places his last cards. The winner is the player who has earn most points. Points are earn by placing or liberating cards, inaugurating new eras.<br/><br/>In Discovery Flash, all players select the cards they want to play at the same time, and then place them in turn. This creates a strong element of risk and suspense, as your outcome will depend on the selection made by the other players.<br/><br/>Discovery Battle is a more complex game in which each card has specific attributes which allow you to attack your opponents, capture loot, make alliances, etc.<br/><br/>"}, "224806": {"rpgartist": ["Jon Gibbons"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "After Zombies Adventure Locale #1: White Star Trailer Park", "rpgdesigner": ["Charles Rice"], "rpgproducer": ["Charles Rice"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3496957.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["AZ: After Zombies"], "rpgpublisher": ["Apocalyptic Games (II)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Horror (Zombies)", "Modern"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3496957_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Welcome to White Star Trailer Park, Adventure Locale #1.

Players work to complete constellations of stars, and build up victory points to win the game.<br/><br/>There is a pool of dice (in a 4 player game, 10 dice for example). These dice are all rolled together, and players choose two from the pool, leaving two dice shared between all players. Now each player combines the two dice they have and the two pool dice to make combinations of two pair. For example, if a player grabbed a 1 and a 3, and the remaining pool dice are a 2 and a 5, they could make the following combos:<br/>a 3 and an 8 (1+2, 3+5)<br/>a 4 and a 7 (1+3, 2+5)<br/>a 5 and a 6 (1+5, 2+3)<br/><br/>Then, using one of these combo pairs, the players place cubes onto the cards of constellations. When a card is full, it scores for each player who got cubes onto it.<br/><br/>A round ends when a player is out of cubes or a fifth card is completed. Bonus points are scored, the game is reset and play continues. When a player gets to 40 points, the round is completed to end the game. The player with the highest score now wins.<br/><br/>Whilst there is some luck in the game, there is choose as well. The last player to take from the pool decides which two will be the pool dice, so there is plenty to consider.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>A new dice game is born from a Supernova!

But take heed, as you outwit and steal influence from other consorts, they will retaliate with distrust and hostility to hinder your pursuit of power.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30ec\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3<br/>\u30cd\u30ac\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30c3\u30af<br/>\u7d0d\u5f97\u306e\u884c\u304f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u6b32\u3057\u3044\u65b9\u306b<br/><br/>\u7e2e\u5c0f\u518d\u751f\u7523\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u305f\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30ec\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u3059\u3002<br/><br/>\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3068\u76ee\u7684<br/>\u3000\u5f8c\u5bae\u306b\u65bc\u3044\u3066\u3001\u738b\u306e\u5bf5\u611b\u3068\u6a29\u52e2\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u3001\u5983\u9054\u304c\u76f8\u4e89\u3046\u306e\u306f\u73cd\u3057\u3044\u5149\u666f\u3067\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002\u305d\u3046\u3001\u3068\u3042\u308b\u738b\u56fd\u3067\u3082\u3001\u73fe\u6642\u70b9\u3067\u306f\u6709\u8c61\u7121\u8c61\u3067\u3057\u304b\u306a\u3044\u59be\u5983\u9054\u304c\u3001\u6709\u529b\u306a\u5983\u9054\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3001\u51fa\u3057\u629c\u304d\u3001\u81ea\u3089\u306e\u5f8c\u5bae\u3067\u306e\u6a29\u52e2\u3092\u9ad8\u3081\u3088\u3046\u3068\u753b\u7b56\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3059\u3002<br/>\u3000\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306f\u3001\u59be\u5983\u3068\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3001\u5f8c\u5bae\u3067\u306e\u6a29\u52e2\u3092\u5f97\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u76ee\u7684\u3068\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u6a29\u52e2\u306f\u70b9\u6570\u3067\u8868\u73fe\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3059\u306e\u3067\u3001\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u7d42\u4e86\u6642\u306b\uff11\u756a\u70b9\u6570\u306e\u9ad8\u304b\u3063\u305f\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u52dd\u5229\u3068\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u306a\u304a\u3001\u51fa\u3057\u629c\u3044\u3066\u6a29\u52e2\u3092\u596a\u3063\u305f\u5983\u9054\u304b\u3089\u306f\u8b66\u6212\u5fc3\u3084\u6575\u610f\u3092\u6301\u305f\u308c\u3001\u884c\u52d5\u3057\u8f9b\u304f\u306a\u308b\u306e\u3067\u6c17\u3092\u4ed8\u3051\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002<br/><br/>"}, "224841": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Douglas Schulz"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Championship Formula Racing: Driver Supplement #1 \u2013 The Ligier", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Action Point Allowance System", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2017", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "12", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Auto Racing"], "boardgameartist": ["Ginger Ludden"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ultra PRO"], "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Racing", "Sports"], "age": "13", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "This page does not exist.

Living in twisted family clans, they raid wasteland settlements and seek the flesh of their foes. Led by the matriarch or the patriarch of the family, a host of gruesome family members are at your command. Whether it&rsquo;s the deceptively lovely Petunia, the simple, but gargantuan Tiny, or even the blood-crazed psychos who hold torture as an art form. The cannibal mutant warband also feature the ability to access to wasteland critters such a great rats, rad roaches, or the powerful psychic husk.<br/><br/>The mutant cannibals bring with them an array of deadly weaponry and deviant equipment. With everything from new vicious close combat weapons, to guns that literally boil the enemy alive with blood, and armor made out of the skin of their poor victims, the armory in this supplement is a true terror to behold.

Each day, players choose a Planning Card, which allows them to travel through the Wilderness and paint (i.e., pick up Landscape Cards). At day&rsquo;s end, they can sell paintings to earn Renown (i.e., turn in Landscape Cards to gain Commission cards worth Renown). Players also earn Renown by completing  Daily Goals and by possessing Landscape Paintings at game&rsquo;s end.<br/><br/>GENERAL PLAY<br/>Each day starts with a simultaneous Planning Phase, followed by individual Trek Phases, and ends with a Clean Up Phase. After the sixth day, a final Scoring Phase occurs.<br/><br/><br/>     Planning Phase: Players draw three Planning Cards and select one for the day. This sets the time they'll leave (initiative) how far they can move, and how many paintings they can paint.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Trek Phase: Based on when players started their hike, each player completes their Trek Phase. During their Trek phase they'll move through the Wilderness, paint landscapes, and sell as commissions for Renown. There is also a end of turn check for the Daily Goal.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Clean Up Phase: Once all players have taken their Trek Phase, the Wilderness, Commission Cards, and Daily Goal are update and then next day begins.<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "8", "name": "Sunset Over Water", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement", "Set Collection", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "224905": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Witch Girls Adventures: Pre-Generated Star-Character Files 1", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3499338.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Animation / Comics", "Fantasy (Modern Urban Fantasy)", "Kid-Friendly", "Occult (Magic)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Channel M Publishing"], "rpg": ["Witch Girls Adventures"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3499338_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>This accessory presents eight pre-generated characters, intended for print-and-play use.

This serves to extend the adventuring day by delaying the party&rsquo;s need to return to civilization, which in turn allows characters to continue exploring dungeons, looting crypts, and slaying monsters.

As a result, most players tend to forget about Recovery Dice in the middle of a fight.  But no more...<br/><br/>Recovery Dice Options takes the concept and runs with it. Rather than relegating Recovery Dice to the role of emergency healing, this sourcebook provides a range of optional ways for<br/>characters to use this mechanic.

The ponies and the hay go inside, filling out a 5&times;5 square. As soon as the outer perimeter of the paddock closes, the ponies can no longer walk out and the game is lost. However, if we manage to fill the 5&times;5 paddock with ponies and hay, then the game is won. Remember, the secret is to work together!<br/><br/>How to play?<br/><br/>During his turn a player needs to take two types of action &ndash; one prevents victory, while the other brings it closer.<br/><br/>What prevents victory is the need to build the paddock by playing all the available fence cards in one&rsquo;s hand.<br/><br/>What brings it closer is putting 3 ponies which have some trait in common into the paddock or using the horseshoe to break two fence cards or adding one hay card into the paddock.<br/><br/>Note that players can share cards to help each other collect the three ponies that they need. You can also discuss and plan moves together, as well as judge whether or not a certain action will be useful. The players are not competing, they are trying to win by working together.<br/><br/>In order to win, the players need to fill the paddock with hay and ponies before the fence is completed. Otherwise the game is lost.<br/><br/>Who can play?<br/><br/>This game is ideal for children who are 4+ years old, as well as mixed groups of kids and adults and families. Great as a fun activity in day care centers, at parties and during trips.<br/><br/>"}, "224995": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Reiner Knizia"], "poll": [], "name": "Wickie: Schatz Ahoi!", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Press Your Luck", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3504200_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3504200.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual first edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Description from the back of the box:<br/><br/>&quot;Vickie the Viking&quot; and his Strong Men are setting sail to capture merchandise, golden coins, jewelry and diamonds. <br/>With some fortune rolling the die and willing to take some risk you'll help the vikings to gather many valuable treasures.<br/><br/>"}, "224996": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Maria Aleksandrova", "Daria Ermakova", "Daria Ermakova"], "average": "10", "poll": [], "name": "Quick Eye", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3504377_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Anna Hidekel"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Simple Rules"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3504377.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Children's Game", "Educational", "Fantasy", "Word Game"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Quick Eye is an amazing game for kids and grown-ups that requires you to use your imagination and notice the surroundings.<br/><br/>How to play?<br/>The rules are simple.
