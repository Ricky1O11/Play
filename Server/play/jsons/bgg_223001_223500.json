It usually uses the exact same spell list as a wizard or sorcerer, but, for some reason, the world can explode when the chaos mage so much as sneezes. To me, wanting to be the chaos mage, the tabletop equivalent of &quot;that guy&quot;, always seemed selfish; moreover, the designs that made &quot;chaos magic&quot; possible seemed a little lazy, for they were almost always something draped over something else that already existed. Nobody wanted to make a dedicated chaos splatbook.<br/><br/>Ultimate Herbalism nips both problems in the bud, introducing a druidic chaos magic system that has been built from the ground up with fun, non-party-killing play in mind.<br/><br/>The Flavor<br/><br/>Herbalists, gourmends, and naturalists are champions of the natural world selected by Mother Nature Herself. In this way, they represent a spontaneous acquisition of power, much like a sorcerer, and not a slowly-learned acquisition of power, like a druid or wizard. Nature's reasons for choosing a particular champion vary widely from individual to individual, but given the variety She maintains in the biosphere to ensure life goes on after a major disaster, this almost-schizophrenic selection process really shouldn't be a surprise.<br/><br/>The Process<br/><br/>1: Each morning, pick random herbs from a selection based on your current biome.<br/><br/>2: Each evening, store leftover herbs overnight day in preservation vessels.<br/><br/>3: When you have enough, plant your favorite herbs in cultivation pots so you always have them.<br/><br/>4: Learn and collect the ingredients for recipes, which give you huge, awesome effects that reward you for being a compulsive gatherer.<br/><br/>Modular Customization<br/><br/>Generous Kickstarter backers have piled on the bonus content in Ultimate Herbalism to make sure the experience any player wants is there with a little twiddling.<br/><br/>A: Give up either the ability to store or the ability to plant in exchange for the ability to collect rocks. Rocks act like detonating AoE herbs, but don't spoil. (Geologist archetype - has its own spellbook)<br/><br/>B: Give up recipes in exchange for the ability to collect bugs. Feed bugs to activate them again and again multiple times per day, giving you a spammable ability if the core system is too random. (Entomologist archetype - has its own spellbook)<br/><br/>C: Force your first herb collection roll of the day to be made in a special high-chaos biome, increasing the chaos for a taste of variety nobody else can have! (Mycologist archetype - has its own spellbook)<br/><br/>D: All of the above - Special care has been made to allow archetypes to stack, utterly transforming the base class with their cumulative effects. Who's up for an entomologist/geologist/mycologist?<br/><br/>Product Features<br/><br/>     3 base classes, the master chef gourmend, the classic herbalist, and a martial specialist with a pet venus fly trap - the naturalist.<br/>     3 naturalist archetypes: creationist, mycologist, and sporekeeper<br/>     9 herbalist archetypes: aromatologist, compounder, entomologist, flowerchild, gardener, geologist, mycologist, poisoner, and zen cultivator.<br/>     9 biomes sharing a 22-page herb log<br/>     27 recipes<br/>     Dozens of feats<br/>     9 microcosms, each with four unique herbs that modify core biome tables<br/>     Over 50 tables.

Let me start off &ndash; I love games. I do. I do. Don&rsquo;t let anyone tell you otherwise: nobody loves games more than me, and when it comes to games, I love them. I do. I&rsquo;ve made plenty of games &ndash; I&rsquo;ve provided more games to the American people than Obama ever will, ever has been, will go, games. And this one &ndash; it&rsquo;s the greatest game of all time, mark my words. The best. Anyone that says different &ndash; we&rsquo;re fighting a war here, ladies and gentlemen, a war, against fake news. If this game doesn&rsquo;t get funded, we&rsquo;ll know &ndash; it&rsquo;s phony, America. This game is going to be huge. *Small loans of a million dollars are accepted and encouraged.<br/><br/>How It Works?<br/><br/>Based off the popular game Mafia, Not My President is a high-energy, 3-12 player game of deception that lasts 5-10 minutes per round. Using your best poker face, diversionary tactics, and a lot of finger pointing, the goal of Not My President is to either find the Trump Supporters amongst you, or, if you are one, to keep yourself hidden through any means necessary. Lying, spreading chaos, and blaming others are highly encouraged tactics. The game begins when players randomly select and privately view a &ldquo;role card,&rdquo; dividing the party into two groups: Trump Supporters and Reasonable People. Players then close their eyes for the election night. During this phase, the free app guides you through the special abilities of your assigned roles. Players secretly swap cards, change identities, and cause more mayhem than a private email server. When everyone has taken their turn, players open their eyes, and the accusations begin. After 5-10 minutes, players vote for who they believe to be the most likely Trump Supporter. If they&rsquo;re wrong, the Trump Supporters win. If they&rsquo;re right, it&rsquo;s probably fake news, and the Reasonable People win.<br/><br/>Narration:<br/><br/>Because this game is so great and since we don't want anyone to feel left out of the party we have made a free downloadable app to narrate the game! Trust me its not Skynet, an extremely credible source told me so.

The wrestlers must have good Chanko-Nabe from the kitchens (Chanko casseroles, a typical food for Sumo wrestlers). You must recruit new Rikishi (wrestlers), and they visit the Ozashiki (parlours) to gain support from Geisha and Oiran. Ultimately the wrestlers will gain victory at the Dohyo (Sumo ring) by pushing off the opponent, sometimes with support from Ninja actions.<br/><br/>This is a 2 player game of comparing numbers in three areas, the Dohyo, the Kitchen, and the Ozashiki. Each section gives you a different victory bonus which you can use further on. Play RIKISHI cards face-down from your hand against these sections, apply any extra actions (such as revealing cards or moving cards) and then compare strengths. The winner of the section advances their chip and this helps them further.<br/><br/>Winning in the Dohyo is crucial to victory, but without Kitchen and Ozashiki support, you would eventually fail there.

Play is very swift and physically as well as mentally demanding.<br/><br/>This game, Color Code, is basically the same. The difference is that there are no illustrations on the played cards, but instead a single color is printed on them. The Reader doesn't read a phrase, but calls out an HTML color-code, like #FFFFFF or #FF0000. When the Reader calls a code, the players must know which color it is and make their play.

Hollandspiele is proud to be bringing two of Mr. Train's most interesting designs to your table in a single box.<br/><br/>Ukrainian Crisis simulates the Russian intervention in the Ukraine beginning in 2014. Diplomacy, propaganda, and international prestige play just as big a part in the proceedings as military force, if not more-so: it's entirely possible for the situation never to result in armed conflict at all. Each of these various elements feeds into and off of the others, resulting in a complex and decision-rich strategic situation. Event cards provide opportunities to turn things to your advantage, or to collapse in folly. The game is driven by the allotment of Resource Points chits. These chits are divided into three categories that each provide a random range of Resource Points: Minimum (1-4), Medium (2-5), and Maximum (2-12, trending toward 7). Each player has a finite number of each type of chit. This not only means that the commitment of chits among different activities within a given turn is important, but that as the game progresses, the choices you made on previous turns limits the range of options available for the end-game. While the decisions are rich and nuanced, the game system is relatively straightforward, making it a great introduction into &quot;pol-mil&quot; gaming.<br/><br/>The Little War is a smaller game about a smaller conflict: the week-long 1939 border war between Hungary and Slovakia. This is more of a straight-forward military engagement, but that doesn't mean it's any less interesting, clever, or innovative. The Little War is driven by an ordinary deck of playing cards (which you'll have to provide yourself). On each turn, six cards are drawn from the deck. One player gets the Hearts (movement) and Diamonds (combat), the other the Spades (movement) and Clubs (combat). The luck of this draw might favor one player this turn, but this will result in it being more likely to favor his opponent on the next.<br/><br/>Together, these two games provide hours of entertainment for adventurous gamers.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Hollandspiele boxed edition"], "name": "Ukrainian Crisis & The Little War", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "age": "0"}, "223437": {"rpgartist": ["Daniel Comerci"], "rpg": ["Ars Gladiatoria"], "statistics": [], "name": "Ars Gladiatoria: The Duel", "rpgdesigner": ["Alberto Tronchi"], "rpgproducer": ["Tobie Abad", "Denise Turner", "Francesco Zani"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3467102.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure"], "rpgpublisher": ["LuceOmbra"], "rpgcategory": ["Quick Start / Fast Play Rules"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3467102_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>Ars Gladiatoria - The Duel is a fast narration and strategy game, designed to be read while playing.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>This light-weight version of the game is typically distributed in a ZIP archive including nine two-page PDF files which are intended for print-and-play use.

For instance; Player X would place 3 green X&rsquo;s and 1 pink. Each player will then play the pieces from the line-up area,  (numbered 1-4) when it is empty the players fill it with 4 new pieces in the same colour order as before. <br/> This way each player will have to place every 4th piece in the opponent&rsquo;s main colour &ndash; this piece can benefit both players &ndash; one can benefit from the shape and the other can use the colour to his/her advantage. <br/> When you achieve 5-in-a-row you earn a number of points based on the placement of the row on the game board. In each square there are dots, like on a dice, that indicates how many points you get from that square. When a player reaches 20 points, he/she wins a set. The game is won, when a player has won 3 sets, with one exception; regardless of point/set score the game can be won instantly by Knock Out.

Your quest is to break each seal, which binds the ancient tome, in order to reveal the mystical knowledge and save New Atlantis from catastrophe. But it isn't easy.

When injured by an enemy, players add a wound card to the top of their deck.  Each class has a certain number of cards and abilities that must be played each turn, and the party is defeated if any player is forced to play a wound.  Special abilities and attacks require charges from crystals, the major Atlantean power source.  Loot and experience are awarded after each battle which can be used to upgrade weapons, crystals, and cards within each player's deck. After each seal is completed, the party can return to Atlantis to receive special benefits such as removing all wounds of one color from their deck, trading in loot, and recharging all of their crystals.<br/><br/>"}, "223474": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jost L.

Join Olive and her friends from the popular children's book series on an adventure to meet the local stream residents and clear out the invaders!  While it may be based on a book series for kids, the  gameplay appeals to a much broader audience.<br/><br/>In Chuckin' Bugs, you collect an assortment of flies in your &quot;fly box&quot; (your card hand) and make casts to The Big Stream where you encounter 10 species of fish, Invasive Species, and hazards that get in the way of your fishing!  Match fly colors to the fish's preferences and roll dice to reel them in!  You also get to cooperate with other players to get Invasive Species out of the river and prevent them from completely shutting down the fishing.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>On their turn, players draw a card to their fly box (hand) and either make a cast with a fly of their choosing, or play one of several special &quot;helper&quot; cards.  When making a cast, the player places their fly on the table and declares which card in The Big Stream they are casting to.  The Big Stream card is turned over revealing either a fish, invasive species, or hazard.  If a fish is revealed, it shows its fly preferences, which dictates how many dice you get to roll and what number is needed to succeed in catching it.<br/><br/>The game includes two card decks: The Big Stream and Camp Tightloops.  The Big Stream contains fish, Invasive Species, hazards, and weather events.  Camp Tightloops contains three different types of flies in four different colors and special cards to give you an edge when you need it.  Some high points fish in The Big Stream require very specific flies to have a chance at them, just like big fish int he real world!  But, if you don't have the right fly in the box, you have the option of playing your special cards, wild cards, or creating a &quot;wild&quot; out of playing different fly type/color combinations with multiple cards.  Invasive species yield points to both players who cooperate in defeating them, and the player who cleans out the most invasives gets a bonus point token at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Is the best strategy to go for several smaller fish or take a chance on the larger high point fish? Should you go after the growing invasive species threats hoping they will pay off, or go immediately for the easy fish you know are there? Do you take chances on netting another player's fish to split the points with them or hope they fail their roll? Every time you play Chuckin' Bugs, The Big Stream has changed like your favorite fishing river.

It combines the Doom first-person shooter franchise with role-playing video game elements. The storyline incorporates many similar events of Doom 3, but involves different characters than those in the third game. The game retains many of the elements of Doom, and is shown in the first person like the original. It is also visually similar to the original Doom. However, the game is fundamentally different in that it is a turn-based role-playing game, rather than a shooter, with greater emphasis on the plot. Combat and movement are turn-based, allowing the player time to select their responses in combat. The player turns at 90 degree angles and moves space by space. It is very important to speak to the scientists and access computer terminals to attain vital information in order to progress through the game, similar to Doom 3.<br/><br/>Many features of the original are retained, including the status bar face, sound effects and the majority of the weapons and monsters. Notably absent are the Chainsaw, Arachnotrons and Spider Mastermind. A difference from the original is that each monster is one of three levels of difficulty, and is colored to indicate this.<br/><br/>The game also adds several new elements. New weapons include the fire axe and fire extinguisher which are useful in combat against certain enemies. The dogs from Wolfenstein 3D appear as a new enemy, known as Hellhounds. A dog collar-like mind-control device allows the hellhounds to be captured as pets, which can then act as both a melee weapon and a shield.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_RPG Doom RPG]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "223001": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Masato Kumagai (\u718a\u8c37\u96c5\u4eba)", "Yu Shimizu (\u5fd7\u745e\u7950)"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Dorahuto Sengoku Daimyou (\u30c9\u30e9\u30d5\u30c8\u6226\u56fd\u5927\u540d)", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Card Drafting", "Simulation"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Masato Kumagai (\u718a\u8c37\u96c5\u4eba)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Yushido Games (\u904a\u5fd7\u5802)"], "boardgameversion": ["Japanese first edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Medieval", "Wargame"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "80", "description": "User summary<br/>\u30c9\u30e9\u30d5\u30c8\u6226\u56fd\u5927\u540d (Dorahuto Sengoku Daimyou) in English is 'Draft Sengoku Daimyo'.

The player who doesn&rsquo;t go first is dealt one additional card. The remaining cards serve as the deck.<br/><br/>The players may then proceed to freely exchange the cards in their hand with cards from the row on the board closest to them to form their own &ldquo;base&rdquo;.

The board and pieces are made of ceramic.<br/><br/>The Lion is the King and the Elephants and Giraffes are the Pawns. The winner is the first to capture the opponent's Lion, or to move their own Lion onto the opponent&rsquo;s Lion's base area.<br/><br/>Pieces have dual natures; one is their shape and the other is their species.<br/><br/>Players move their own pieces and try to sandwich any of the opponent's piece or pieces. If the player's pieces making the sandwich are of the same species, this is a capture and the captured animals are removed from the board. A Lion can sandwich and capture any opponent&rsquo;s pieces, using their own Elephant or Giraffe piece as the other end of the sandwich.<br/><br/>But the dual nature of the pieces gives the game more complexity.<br/><br/>For example, a player's own Elephant piece will sandwich and capture the opponent's Giraffes and Lion by using the opponent's Elephant. The same specie will work together! Likewise, the opposing Giraffes will work together to capture the opponent's Elephants and Lion. Only the two Lions will not work together.<br/><br/>This dual system is a unique and very interesting system first invented by the designer Mitsuo Yamamoto in 2008, and the game was first produced in 2011, a small and a large edition.

Many believe it to be a joint military/alien underground facility where horrible experiments are being conducted on abducted humans and various life forms held captive there. In the base&rsquo;s subterranean depths is where you are being held prisoner. Welcome to the bizarre and top secret world of &lsquo;Escape from Dulce,' Sentient Cow Games first installment in our themed anthology board game series called &ldquo;Secret Unknown Stuff, where players are taken through science fiction adventures, supernatural stories and unexplained events.<br/><br/>Escape from Dulce is a collaborative, turn-based, sci-fi adventure game for 2 to 6 players, ages 14 and up. Players choose from 8 hilariously bizarre prisoners, including a two-headed mutant cow that can strap machine guns on its back, to a alien hybrid super solider who dreams of being a normal teenager and hanging out at the &lsquo;mall.&rsquo; Each player starts with special skills and different abilities, which they can increase as they escape.<br/><br/>Escape from Dulce will be different each time it's played, because of how the player decides to customize their character, interact with the encounter cards, and how our 'artificial intelligence' combat system dictates how the enemies will focus their attacks. Story based encounter cards add an organic 'role-play' feel to game play, forcing the players to adapt to an ever-changing base full of traps and self-strategizing human and non-human enemies. The game thinks. It's alive. And it&rsquo;s trying to kill you.<br/><br/>Players must find hidden objectives to gain entry to the next level, while constantly working to keep the alarm from reaching critical and releasing the dreaded 'Man in Black.' The alarm building aspect creates a sense of urgency and drive to the game. Players can also enlist the help of strange 'hidden characters' along the way, as they progress up seven dangerous levels of a 3D game board to freedom.<br/><br/>"}, "223170": {"rpgdesigner": ["Joshua L.

A residual force left from the act of creation that brought this reality into being, this energy is the cause of nearly all the strangeness found in the world: from the bizarre monsters spawned within the foul slicks pooling in caves deep under Bl&ouml;tland to the hidden kingdoms of the faeries; it is responsible for the floating lands above the Desolation and countless other oddities one encounters when traveling the lands of R&ucirc;l and beyond.<br/><br/>This energy has even been harnessed and channeled into the creation of artifacts and relics of wondrous and terrible power. More common, however, than all of these supernatural phenomena and wonders are spells: magical effects discovered, codified, and devised by those people who make a study of magic in its many forms. From the destruction of the fireball spell to the awful glory of hateful defecation, spells offer staggering power to those individuals with the patience, cunning, and will to learn them.<br/><br/>The Paths of Shadows series expands and updates certain paths from Shadow of the Demon Lord to create new variations and possibilities. Paths of Power deals with the sorcerer, spellbinder, warlock, and wizard, and in most cases offers upgrades and enhancements to make them even more exciting to play.
