Each player starts with a cash loan and one of 57 available sections of land, and may buy more land on any turn.  On each section of land, players may plant one of four crops or raise one of four kinds of livestock. <br/> Each turn represents one of the four seasons.  The game consists of 20 turns (five &quot;years&quot; or full crop cycles).  Each turn or season is divided into 3 phases which are played simultaneously by all players.  In the &quot;Purchase&quot; phase players may buy land and animals and (if in season) plant crops.  The &quot;Event&quot; phase consists of drawing cards which introduce events or conditions which may or may not affect players.  For example, when a Tornado or Oil Strike event is drawn, a die roll mechanism is used to select specific land sections which are affected. In the &quot;Harvest&quot; phase, players sell any mature crops or livestock at the market price listed on a master Harvest card drawn for that turn.<br/><br/>Players may pay off their initial loan at any time.  The amount due (representing combined principal and interest) grows substantially each &quot;year&quot;.  After the final turn, the player with the most cash left after paying off the loan is the winner.  Land and other permanent farming assets may not be sold to raise cash.  This simulates the practice of the first generation retiring and handing the farming operation intact to the next generation.<br/><br/>The game mechanism allows for solitaire play, in which the object would be to record a personal best amount of cash at the end.  The primary effect of introducing more players is the competition for prime farmland.  The length of play is not affected greatly since each phase is played simultaneously by all.  Game testing showed a substantial increase in speed of play after players had played 2-3 times.  For a game in which most or all players are novices, allow 4 hours.<br/><br/>Although the game includes a substantial amount of luck (farmers cannot control weather or market prices) it cannot be won by luck alone.  Successful players will learn how to best farm different types of land (it is not all equal), manage risk, and select appropriate crop or livestock strategies (the various options include a wide range of risk/reward trade offs).<br/><br/>The game could be used in an educational setting either to illustrate the historical settling of the prairies or to demonstrate the basics of investing in any context (managing risk, balancing a portfolio, using leverage, etc.)<br/><br/>"}, "34918": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Reise Durch das Bistum Osnabr\u00fcck", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Cities: Osnabr\u00fcck"], "maxplayers": "7", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic304861_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Kirchenbote des Bistums Osnabr\u00fcck"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic304861.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Travel"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From the box--<br/><br/>Kurzbeschreibung: Das Spiel zeigt das Bistum Osnabr&uuml;ck mit vielen wichtigen und interessanten Orten.

Cards show one of five different colors/symbols, each corresponding to one path; in addition, each card shows a number (0-10, twice each). In each color, each player can play his cards in either ascending or descending order. As in Lost Cities, it's better to concentrate on a few paths since the final spaces on a path grant high points, but ending early gives negative ones.<br/><br/>The active player plays one card (out of a hand of eight) or discards one, then moves the corresponding playing piece on the path. Many of the spaces have a token that grants some bonus: either immediate points (counted on the scoring track), an extra move on a path, or wishing stones that are needed at game end to avoid negative points.<br/><br/>The game ends when five playing pieces (from any combination of players) have reached the seventh (or higher) space on their respective paths. Now, scoring happens: <br/><br/>     Pieces that moved only 1-3 steps earn negative points (-4, -3, -2).<br/>     Pieces with 4+ steps earn points (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10). <br/>     One piece of each player twice the height of other pieces scores double, either positive or negative. <br/>     Holding fewer than two wish stones earns negative points (-3 / -4), while a collection of five or more stones yields a bonus of 10 points.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>All endgame points are added to any scored during the game. The player with the highest score wins!<br/><br/><br/>Primary differences between Lost Cities: The Board Game and Keltis:<br/><br/>1. In LCBG you play 3 rounds, scoring at the end of all 3 for the monuments you collect. (Normal scoring occurs each round.) In Keltis, you only play 1 round, and score everything each round. This is not just a rule difference, as the scoring is different for the monuments/stones based on the number collected.<br/><br/>2. In Keltis, you may play your cards in either order, high to low, or low to high. In LCBG, you must go low to high.<br/><br/>Note: the rules for LCBG have the Keltis rules as variants, and have the board elements necessary for #1 above. Keltis does not have the rules nor board elements to play LCBG.<br/><br/>There are more differences that are non-substantive.

Please subscribe to my game design blog for latest updates.<br/><br/>Sturm Europa! is a grand strategic simulation, currently in pre-production, that recreates the entire European conflict during the Second World War.  Euro-style wooden pieces are used to depict resources, that depending on placement, represent air, land, and sea units. Each player has a privacy screen that creates &quot;fog of war&quot; by keeping resources and units not on the front line hidden.  Sturm Europa! will distinguish itself from other games of the genre in these key areas:<br/><br/>Playability:  The entire war, Fall 1939 to the bitter end (Spring 1945 or later), can be played in 6-8 hours. No hexes, no counters, and low luck.<br/><br/>Scale:  The map board employs area movement over land regions but the low unit density allows players to realize the full impact of mobile warfare and appreciate the daunting size of Mother Russia without slowing game play unnecessarily.  A unique front-reserve combat system allows for operational level details like blitzes, assaults, encirclements, feints, static defense, and defense in depth which are normally lost in grand-strategic simulations.<br/><br/>Units:  Units are not only rated by movement, but attrition, assault, and blitz strength.  Elite units are created by combat experience, events, and tech research - introducing an extra dimension as units are upgraded and downgraded throughout the war, reflecting varying levels of experience, training, leadership, and technology.<br/><br/>Production:  Sturm Europa! goes beyond the standard model of linking military production to a GDP estimate.  Nations must mobilize to achieve full wartime production but it takes much more to wage war than just massive production lines.  Manpower, oil, steel, and even trained pilots are all tracked without ANY bookkeeping through an innovative system of collecting resources as strategy cards are played.  Resources are consumed by prolonged offensives so logistics plays just as much a factor as unit strength.<br/><br/>Strategy Cards:  Sturm Europa! is a card driven game (i.e. Paths of Glory). Events introduce historical and political events in a realistic fashion while eliminating scripting and &quot;look up&quot; rules.  There is a tangible cause-effect relationship to every event and nothing occurs in a seemingly random or ahistorical manner.  Players play the cards - the cards don't play the players.  Most importantly, the core mechanic of tough gut wrenching decisions which make CDGs so fun is still preserved.<br/><br/>Technology: Players can customize their units to fight the style of war that best suits their strategy. Germany can develop the He 100 long range fighter that greatly improves their chances in the Battle of Britain. The Americans can develop a heavy-medium tank instead of sending Shermans to get chewed up by King Tigers. Tough decisions will have to be made to implement new technologies though.

Each player champions one of the characters at Miskatonic University in 1923. The game host reads an opening hook about how bodies have gone missing from the graveyard. At this point the players take over telling the tale. Each turn a player buys the right to make the next action in the game. They make up a short scene and pick another player to be their referee. The ref sets the &quot;to happen&quot; roll and the player rolls. It either happens and is written down by the players or doesn't. If players like they can buy the right to make a counter-argument to the first players action. A dice rolling contest settles what happens. As you see the rules are very simple but they allow a completely unique game every time.<br/><br/>Players quickly learn how to play - it only takes a turn or two and then never need to look at the rules again. It does take creativity though. If you don't like making stuff up then this is not the game for you but if you do like quick paced back and forth creation then you'll love it.<br/><br/>The boxed board game comes with a hard back board that is color and varnished but I must say that these are hand crafted by the game maker so this is more an art product than a slick made in China game. The game uses wooden counters with stickers but as you wish they can be replaced by metal figures.

INTRODUCTION<br/>With the hero's success in destroying the Black Knight's plan in Dawn, it took longer for him to organise his minions. But the time has come at last, the Great War has begun! Backed up by a very strong Dark Magic, he commands a huge army of Greenskins including the fierce  Goblorcs, unnatural Beasts, and now the Ice Monsters and even the Undeads have joined his army. The worst part is the Light Sword's new power -- the Black Knight now can heal his minions around him, including himself, in seconds!<br/><br/>Approaching from the west , in a very short time three castles have fallen to his hands, and his armies are swiftly heading to the capital of D. Once again everything seems hopeless and the King of D has called the 18 legendary heroes to gather in the Dungeon of D, deep in the Forest of D to the south, where legend says that centuries ago the Great Wizard of D hid the Amulet of D'eugor. It is believed that only the legendary Amulet of D'eugor can nullify the Light Sword&rsquo;s power. Unfortunately, the Black Knight knew about this too, so he placed a very strong magical barrier on the entrance to keep anyone from entering.<br/><br/>Luckily, the King has also summoned Daryn and Derek. They can combine their magical abilities to open the barrier for a very short time, allowing just one person to enter the dungeon. But even with their combined power, they can only do this once every three hours. So, one by one the 18 heroes enter the dungeon, hoping to find the Amulet of D'eugor and survive to exit the dungeon. So far no one has returned&hellip; and you are hero number 18, the last person to enter the dungeon. Daryn looks into your eyes before you enter the crack in the barrier. &quot;Please, you are our last hope&hellip;&quot; You nod a little, then jump in&hellip;.<br/><br/>2.

There are Corps HQs for the Nationalists and Army HQs for the Republic. There are one 22&quot; x 17&quot;map, and two &frac12;&quot; counter sheets including Nationalist, Republicans, Italian, French, German, Portuguese and British units. The sequence of play is quite classic: Mutual Administrative Phase (Events, replacements, reinforcements, withdrawals), Nationalist Movement-Combat, Republican Movement-Combat, Victory/Attrition Phase. Supply is checked for both sides at the end of each turn.<br/><br/>The main trouble designing this game was how to simulate the first months of the war and the transition to a more conventional conflict during and after the battles for Madrid (October 1936-March 1937). The main unit during the firsts stages of the war was the &quot;column&quot; formed by a mix of police, army, paramilitary forces, volunteers, etc. The &quot;column&quot; tactics was used during the Moroccan wars, and consisted in separating a force in small independent groups, highly mobile but with few possibilities of supporting each other. These tactics were mostly used by the Nationalists, but also by the Republicans. For the Nationalists, it worked against the militias of the early months of the war but failed against a better organized, armed and commanded army during the battles for Madrid. To simulate this, most early Republican units have two steps: the first would be the &quot;column&quot; or &quot;militia&quot; side, the second the &quot;Ej&eacute;rcito Popular&quot; (People&rsquo;s Army) side. After passing a &quot;Conversion&quot; or &quot;Militarization&quot; phase, the Republican columns are flipped to their EP side. The &quot;Militarization&quot; , that began during the Fall of 1936, was the conversion of the politically enthusiastic but poorly led and trained militia in more orthodox military units. The Nationalist columns are divided between &quot;Army of Africa&quot; columns and the rest. Their colonial units are two-steppers and are withdrawn and substituted by brigades and divisions during 1937. The O.B. of the first months of the war is also a problem. Between July and November 1936 both sides formed dozens of small military and paramilitary units, called &quot;battalions&quot;, &quot;columns&quot;, &quot;regiments&quot;, etc., etc. It is rare to find two authors that have the same OB, and the few that offer an Order of Battle are rather imprecise. Sometimes the same column receives different names. One author names it after their commander, other after their area of operations, and so on... so I had to compare and check which column was cited in most of the sources.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "average": "7.40108", "name": "The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939", "playingtime": "360", "boardgamemechanic": ["Chit-Pull System", "Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "0", "usersrated": "186", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Cities: Ceuta", "Country: Portugal", "Country: Spain", "Spanish Civil War"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode Twelve of The Gaming Gang"]}, "34660": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "AppLEOpoly", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Dice Rolling", "Player Elimination", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Set Collection", "Stock Holding", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "1989", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Monopoly"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic309215_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Leo Burnett Company, Inc."], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic309215.jpg", "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Negotiation"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "AppLEOpoly is a promotional game published by the Leo Burnett Company, Inc to give to their employees on their 54th anniversary.

The rulebook has a general information section on dogs, including what meaning of different behavior in dogs, what an angry/scared dog looks like, and how to teach children about dogs. Sometimes, the rules instruct the players to act dog like (barking, rolling etc.)<br/><br/>The game includes a board with an imaginary village printed on it, 4 playing pieces (dogs) on plastic bases, a deck of cards which represent 24 breeds of dog - some of which are &quot;leaders&quot; - and one 6-sided die. All of the dogs belong to families living in the village, identified by the first letter of a dog's name.<br/><br/>The game is subdivided into 6 different variants:<br/><br/>Game #1: 2-4 players, 10-15 minutes. This is described as a &quot;warm-up&quot; game, the board is not used. Players are &quot;leader&quot; dogs trying to gather their own pack by drawing cards blindly. The player with the most dogs after all non-leader breeds have been drawn wins.<br/><br/>This game also has a solitaire variant.<br/><br/>Game #2: 2-4 players, 30 minutes. Again, the players represent leaders trying to gather a pack. This is accomplished by visiting the 4 houses in the village to pick up dogs, then take them to the dog park.<br/><br/>This game has rule variants to make it a bit more challenging.<br/><br/>Game #3: 2-4 players, 20-30 minutes. Again, the players represent leaders, but this time they already have a pack. The players must return the dogs in their pack to the families, then find a way to their own house.<br/><br/>Game #4: 3 or more players, 10-20 minutes. This time the players must co-operate to gather a pack and take it to the dog park, playing against time (die rolls).<br/><br/>This game also has a solitaire variant.<br/> Game #5: 2-4 players, 20-30 minutes. This is basically a version of the Game of Authors - players are trying to complete series of dogs belonging to the same family.<br/><br/>Game #6: Solitaire, variable playing time.

Instead, players builds their own word puzzles in front of them. Letters are worth points (vowels are worth 1 point, consonants 2 points, and super consonants J, K, Qu, X, and Z, are worth 4) the object of the game is to be the first player to reach 500 points. Every player randomly selects eight tiles and places them face down. Simultaneously, players turn them over and begin building the puzzles with as many letters from their individual pile as possible. Once someone has used up all eight tiles, he or she says &quot;Saygo&quot; and all players will select another tile. If nobody can use their tiles it is a stalemate, and everyone selects another tile. Should players find they can not use all of their tiles, they have the option of rearranging their puzzles as often as needed, in attempt to use all letters. The game continues until all tiles are used and the last person to use his/her last tile yells &quot;done&quot;. Once the group verifies the accuracy of the winning player's words, the winner collects the remaining letters and adds them to his/her score. Once a player has 500 points (that number can be lowered or raised if desired), the round is finished and players can play again.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "34684": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Tom Espen"], "average": "4.33333", "poll": [], "name": "M\u00e4rchenland", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move", "Set Collection", "Storytelling", "Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1500989_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Tom Espen"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Espenlaub"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1500989.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Fantasy", "Novel-based"], "age": "4", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "This is a children's game based on the fairy-tales by the Brothers Grimm.<br/><br/>It comes with a colorful board, 36 story tiles, 4 player pawns and a six-sided die.

You'll find a preview of the upcoming World at War boxed game, World at War: Blood and Bridges. Two new scenarios, Clearing Hell's Highway, and Poor Bloody Infantry.  Two battle reports with semi-fictionalized accounts recounts of WaW scenarios (Some of you call these after action reports). A ten page article examining strategy in the World at War series and the specific tactics needed to win all six Eisenbach Gap scenarios.  Even variants for night fighting, and a design your own scenarios &quot;how to&quot; article. And much more... including a unit-by-unit analysis of the platoons of Eisenbach Gap...<br/><br/>World at War has been a pleasant, if mild, surprise for Lock &lsquo;n Load Publishing. I designed the game because I wanted to play it. Yes, in the back of my mind, I felt that there might be a market for something depicting the war that never happened, but primarily I created the game because it interests me.<br/><br/>In ten years of writing and designing, that&rsquo;s the only thing I&rsquo;ve found that works. I&rsquo;ve designed and written on spec, and gave those pieces my best shot, but it seems that the games, the writing, that gets my juices flowing are the things other people also enjoy.<br/><br/>I absolutely love playing World at War. I like the combat system, am intrigued by the era, and fascinated by the idea of a series of games that link together to tell a story. So, I&rsquo;m happy that other people enjoy it too.<br/><br/>I also hope that this guide enhances your enjoyment. We have strived to make a guide that is visually appealing, interesting, and diversified. Inside you&rsquo;ll find articles on strategy, the percentages of rolling dice in World at War, battle reports (or after action reports as some of you prefer), and unit analysis. What you won&rsquo;t find are dry as dust articles on the actual forces that lined the West German border or mind-numbing diatribes on Soviet Doctrine. Why? Because that stuff just doesn&rsquo;t interest me.<br/><br/>There are lots of tables comparing the strength and weakness of an M1 Abrams platoon and a T-72 platoon in the World at War system.

Indeed, unlike many conventional wargames with little or no &lsquo;role-playing&rsquo; element, in Dresda you are your units' Commander in the field, and you not only have the responsibility of commanding the unit in battle, but also the headaches of paying your troops, buying their equipment and generally trying to improve your (and their) financial position.<br/><br/>Dresda is a scenario driven game, not points based one. This means that careful thought needs to be given to the designing of scenarios by the GM. So, although you can line up your troops on opposite sides of the table and simply advance until you bump into each other in the centre, you'll find this isn't really much fun, and you'll quickly find that your games will be much more enjoyable if you (and/or a good GM) put some effort into designing an interesting or challenging scenario.<br/><br/>Of course, it also helps to create a feeling of unit continuity by treating your unit as a group of individuals rather than disposable 'cannon (or halberd)-fodder'. Name each of them, decide what they like to eat, drink and how they feel about their Mum, and suddenly you can see them as characters in a role-playing game, not just as troops in a &lsquo;one-off&rsquo; wargame.<br/><br/>Over a number of games you'll see your unit develop, watch their fortunes wax and wane and individual characters come and go. Eventually you'll find that some of these factors will start to dictate your actions on the battlefield, for instance you may see &lsquo;heroic&rsquo; traits develop in one character or cowardly traits in another as the miniatures begin to become characters in their own right, and not just anonymous lumps of painted white metal.<br/><br/>The Aim of the Game<br/><br/>The basic aim of Dresda is to raise a small unit of fighters, fight battles and get rich!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, whilst this basic aim is simple, it isn't necessarily easy. What's more, this is likely to be a more 'hands-on' experience than you may be used to, even in skirmish wargaming.
