The goal is to draw a small, medium and large asteroid from the deck and play them face up in front of the player.  Once at least on asteroid is played, the player can then begin to seed the asteroid with mineral cards (also found in the deck).<br/>  <br/>There are six unique minerals, and each asteroid has a requirement of how many minerals are needed to seed it.  Once a player has the correct number of minerals for the asteroid, they play them on top of the face up asteroids they have discovered so far.<br/><br/>The final step for the player is to mine the minerals on a fully seeded asteroid.  Players only seed and mine their own asteroids.  To mine an asteroid, the player must use a pricing contract card (found throughout the deck).  These pricing cards have various values from 20 to 120 and are an important part of the scoring.  The player is allowed to mine one mineral for each drill on their starship per contract card they hold.<br/><br/>Once the player fully depletes an asteroid of minerals, they turn it sideways to score additional points. The first player to mine all three of the asteroids wins the hand, and all players tally their score up to that point.<br/><br/>The first player to reach 4000 points wins the game.

They will choose an Objective, which tells them if they are heroic or villainous, it also determines the goal in which they need to accomplish to win the game. They will create a 40-card play deck, with characters, objects, and one-shot single use action cards. Lastly, they will choose a 12-card Location deck to represent where the epic battles in Slab City will take place. Battle For The Universe has multiple paths to victory, and not all involve killing your opponent. Some players may opt to rescue civilians. Others may try to amass wealth or simply beat and bring opposing characters to justice. All of these goals are possible, and more.

Its profits catapulted the British Empire to global dominance and shaped the fate of some of the world&rsquo;s great nations. But, its ascent was anything but easy. The Company was filled with diverging interests and struggled constantly at home and abroad.<br/><br/>John Company attempts to tell the story of the British East India Company from the inside out. Players will steer their dynasties through the company&rsquo;s history, vying for position, power, and prestige. The goal of the game is simple: use the Company and the Company&rsquo;s trade to secure your place in society back home. To this end you will guide your scions through their careers, exchanging favors for positions in London or plush colonial posts. Players will collectively control the Company, facing tough budgetary decisions and conflicting interests. Should a Governor conduct a campaign to expand company holdings or invest in his region&rsquo;s infrastructure? Perhaps the honest tax revenues would be better diverted to expand his summer estate back home...<br/><br/>As the game continues, the Company may face open rebellion in India or outright failure as it grapples with increasingly bold attempts at regulation from the British government. It&rsquo;s even possible that the Company&rsquo;s trade monopoly will be revoked, leaving the players to form and operate their own trading firms. Each game offers a huge range of possibilities, informed chiefly by the decisions the players make. In addition, players can tailor their experience by using one of the three tournament scenarios that cover the Early, Mid, and Late company that can be played in about 90 minutes. The game also offers a full campaign game that will take players from 1720 to 1857 in an evening.<br/><br/>Taking its inspiration from Phil Eklund&rsquo;s seminal Lords games, John Company offers Food Chain Magnate by way of Republic of Rome. And, with only sixty cards and a modest footprint, John Company is one of the most accessible SMG offerings to date.<br/><br/>"}, "211717": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3227776.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Micha\u0142 Oracz", "Jakub Wi\u015bniewski"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Pawe\u0142 Nizio\u0142ek", "Micha\u0142 Oracz"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Galakta"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3227776_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Exploration", "Negotiation", "Video Game Theme"], "description": "After hours of efforts, the generator has finally started working and the screen is turning blue from its long-dead black.

Dark cults serving nameless horrors must be stopped by brave heroes. Epic quests spawned by divine machinations put heroes into strange lands battling bizarre monsters. Godly ambition drives characters into places not meant for mortals.<br/><br/>But the problem is gods are given short shrift at the game table. Clerics and other player characters draw powers from these beings and wield it in their names, yet what thanks do the gods get for this? Those players who bother to write the name of a deity on their character sheet soon forget about it along with the 10 foot pole in their backpack. Neglected and ignored, gods underperform for your campaign, making your job as GM tougher.<br/><br/>The gods should be active plot agents for you! They should inspire factions and villains to threaten the PCs. They should provide you (un)holy places and dungeons for the party explore. And gods should give you a wonderful platform to drive stories from, and inspire and enhance your plots with.<br/><br/>However, we feel this is should not be done with simplistic confrontations with gods where they beat the PCs over the head with quests and plot hooks. Nothing breaks immersion more than NPCs with obvious golden exclamation marks over their heads. Instead, aim for subtle. Render the gods' influence through mortal religions, followers seeking divine favour, and monsters transformed by immortal threads.<br/><br/>This book will show you how to do this. We give you a system that starts at the top - god creation - and guides you through the layers of pantheon creation, religion creation, and divine-touched monster design so you have everything you need to meddle in the character's lives with the subtlety of Shakespeare. No longer will your gods be taken for granted and be just spell sieves for spoiled PCs. It's time for your gods to take part in your milieu and be active agents within it, to make your job of plotting and creating cool foes and encounters much easier. It's time to wield the Mythic God Generator!<br/><br/>Become a Divine Game Master<br/><br/>This book arms you for your GMing life.

The scales of power can shift suddenly all with a change of wind or an enemy's skills as a master gunner, skilled sailor, or clever scoundrel.<br/><br/><br/>How to play<br/><br/><br/>Set up<br/><br/>Each player gets a Home Island a sturdy Sloop to begin their quest for adventure and riches and the race to gain the most Power &amp; Influence over the islands.<br/><br/><br/>Player turn<br/><br/><br/>1- Check Wind<br/><br/>Check wind timer and reset wind direction if necessary.<br/><br/><br/>2- Perform actions<br/><br/>During their turn a player gets 4 actions.<br/><br/><br/>     Sail up to 2 steps leeward or straight to leeward<br/>     Sail 1 step to windward (may not sail straight to windward)<br/>     Use Gunnery card<br/>     Use a Sailing card<br/>     Dock/Go to town<br/>     Upgrade a ship<br/>     Buy a new sloop<br/>     Relaunch a sunken ship<br/>     Dive for sunken treasure<br/>     Buy up to three cards (Sailing and/or Gunnery) for 2 gold each<br/>     Buy 1 Power and Influence token for 8 gold (once per turn, not allowed during final round)<br/><br/><br/><br/>3- Collect Power and Influence tokens &amp; claim accomplished Missions<br/><br/><br/>     +1 Selling cargo for 2 gold per ton during a docking action<br/>     +1 Buy Power and Influence for 8 gold (not allowed during final round)<br/>     Sink an enemy ship<br/>         +2 for a Sloop<br/>         +3 for a Frigate/Barque<br/>         +4 for a Indiaman/Man o' War<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>All awards doubled during final round<br/><br/><br/>4- Draw and carry out 1 Event card<br/><br/><br/>The Wind<br/><br/>The wind can be an unpredictable ally or fierce opponent. It dictates how far and which directions ships can sail and a change in the wind change quickly shift the balance of power.<br/><br/><br/>Sailing &amp; Fighting<br/><br/>A players hand consists of Sailing and Gunnery cards which are used then discarded to move across the board with ease, to attack other players ships or perhaps fend off an opponent. The diversity and strength of these two decks can turn vulnerable seeming Sloop into a fierce or wily opponent.<br/><br/><br/>Trading<br/><br/>By filling a ship's hold with one of 3 commodities in the game and trading it to the neighbouring islands, players can begin to amass gold and gain Power &amp; Influence.<br/><br/><br/>Upgrades<br/><br/>This gold can be used to add ships to their fleet or upgrade their Sloop or Sloops to be fierce fighting ships like Frigates and Man o' War or rich merchant vessels like Barques and the famous Indiaman and take on enemies to win Power. But be careful, as a ship becomes laden with treasure, it will become targets for other players.<br/><br/><br/>Events<br/><br/>Events add another wrinkle of unpredictability in the game. At the end of each players turn a random event occurs which may effect their fleet, or the entire board with positive or perhaps disastrous consequences.<br/><br/><br/>Missions<br/><br/>Missions set out tasks that players can accomplish during their turn for a significant payout. Be sure to store as much treasure on your home island as possible because treasure still on a ship at the end of the game only counts for half of what gold on shore is worth.<br/><br/><br/>End Game<br/><br/>In the final round the stakes are raised as the race to get the most Power &amp; Influence over the Lunar Islands nears an end. Players who have thought strategically and planned can turn this to their advantage and sweep victory out from under their opponents.<br/><br/><br/>Victory<br/><br/><br/>End of game awards<br/><br/><br/>     +1 for each Sloop in your fleet<br/>     +2 for each Frigate/Barque in your fleet<br/>     +3 for each Indiaman/Man o' War in your fleet<br/>     +1 for first Mission, +2 for second, +3 for third, etc.<br/>     +1 for every 10 treasure<br/><br/><br/>At the end of the game the player with the most Power and Influence wins.

Corruption Resistance is how susceptible a character is to the dark forces still at work in Ilkannon.  This is used mostly during events.  Movement is how far the character can move on their turn.  Restoration is how many tiles a character can restore on their turn.  Ingenuity is used for events, and is based on how well the character deals with certain situations outside of their normal state.  Corruption Resistance and Ingenuity affect how many dice the character rolls during certain events.<br/><br/>The city of Ilkannon is composed of sixteen tiles, laid out in a grid of four by four.  These tiles are double sided, with one side being Wilderness and the other side being the Restored city.<br/><br/>Turn order is as follows:<br/><br/>1) Move or Restore<br/>2) Draw an Event<br/>3) Corruption activates.

Any number of decisions or events could have altered the outcome, and 'To The Last Extremity' gives players the chance to see what might have been.&quot; --from the rule book.<br/><br/>In To The Last Extremity the forces of the fledgling United States of America, consisting of Continental Army infantry and artillery, local militia, and allied Oneida Indian units, face off against the besieging forces consisting of British Army infantry and artillery, Hessian J&auml;gers, Canadian militia, and American Indian allies. Each side receives a deck of cards representing its military forces and the various leaders instrumental in the campaign, such as the American commander, Col. Peter Gansevoort, and the British commander, Brig. Gen. Barry St. Leger, plus many others (including American Indian leaders and Benedict Arnold before he turned traitor!).<br/><br/>Players face off on opposite sides of a period map of the area surrounding Fort Stanwix. At the beginning of each turn, the American player will roll to see if a Chance card is drawn. Chance cards introduce historical events into the game and their effects on one or both sides. The rule book has detailed historical descriptions of each event, which are informational only, but help to bring the history and drama of the Siege of Fort Stanwix to life. Following a possible Chance card draw, players will secretly assign forces and leaders to each of the four sides of Fort Stanwix: north, south, east, and west. How the players choose to distribute their forces will determine the outcome of the siege. Players then reveal their cards. If the British have assigned forces to assault one or more sides of the fort, players will compare the strengths of the opposing forces on that side and roll a die to determine the resultant casualties and whether a breach of the fortress walls has occurred. If the British achieve two breaches on the same turn, they have taken the fort and win the game. If, after 13 turns, the British fail to take the fort, the outnumbered Americans have broken the siege and have defeated the British.<br/><br/>On each turn, the British may also elect to dig entrenchments to protect their artillery, or bombard or skirmish with sides of the fort to effect American morale.<br/><br/>Easily playable in under an hour, &quot;To The Last Extremity&quot; is a simple wargame that provides a great deal of historical flavor surrounding one of the earliest American victories achieved in U.S. history.<br/><br/>"}, "211965": {"rpgartist": ["Andrew DeFelice", "Shutterstock.com"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Beyond the Firelight Quick-Start Rules: Goody Eleanor", "rpgdesigner": ["Aaron T.
