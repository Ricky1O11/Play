Volleys are done all at once, with the opponent not announcing hits until the volley is over.  Players track these developments by crossing off boxes on their paper.  When a player sends a volley, if he has previously received any hits, those hits are subtracted from the 15 bombs he may fire on his current turn.<br/><br/>Airplane bombs strike only the square called by the player, rockets strike the first square and any two adjoining squares called immediately by the player, and atomics strike the initial square as well as the four adjoining squares along all four sides.

Now in card game form, no real blood will be spilled, but the strategy, tactics, and power-plays still abound. Based upon a game that exists in the True Blood universe, Night Eternal: The Game is a competitive card game of intrigue, power-plays and betrayal where vampires jockey for power, position and ultimate control of the rival factions: The Authority and The Monarchy.<br/><br/>Players must ante blood from their pools to both factions each turn of the game. Players build up their hands by acquiring cards from a powerful, but temperamental Immortals deck and a willing and able Agent deck. The cards that a player chooses to play will determine the faction to which he or she is loyal...for now. In turn order, each player plays out one card (face up) during each of three rounds each turn, so you never just how much power it will take to seize control of a faction each turn.<br/><br/>Players must pay attention to the cards their opponents are playing. It's more difficult to enable a powerful card's special ability if your opponents are playing weaker cards. Weaker card special abilities are easy to resolve, but weakness doesn't win the war. Special abilities might allow a player to steal blood from a faction or move it from one faction to another, so switching your loyalty to a new faction (by playing cards of that faction) might just throw off your opponents' best laid plans.<br/><br/>In the end, power still rules the day. At the end of each turn (after three rounds of card play), the cards are scored. The player with the highest value of Authority cards earns that faction's blood pool. The player with the highest value of Monarchy cards earns that faction's blood pool. The key to victory is to have more blood tokens than any other player when the first player dies...by running out<br/>of blood.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "age": "15", "name": "Night Eternal: The Game", "playingtime": "30", "average": "6.308", "usersrated": "45", "boardgamefamily": ["Vampires"]}, "138128": {"poll": [], "name": "Spawn (GBC)", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Game Boy Color edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Comics"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Konami"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Beat 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Game Boy Color"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Konami"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Based on the comic books of the same name, players control Spawn through many levels.

In this position, and with the backing of the army, Arabi was the de facto ruler of the country. Arabi was viewed with distrust in both Britain and France. This distrust was not without reason as he and his followers viewed the Khedive as a puppet of the Europeans, attacked Europeans in the streets, and threatened to nationalize the Suez Canal leaving the stockholders without a cent, and to repudiate Egypt's foreign loans.<br/><br/>A combination of fear for the Canal, the shortest route to India after all, the outraged cries of the investors and a pinch of concern for the Europeans in Egypt, plus a heavy dose of Jingoism led the British government to prepare for war. France, for some very convoluted internal political reasons, reversed policy and refused to help.<br/><br/>While an Army was being assembled the British decided that their first step should be to neutralize the extensive coastal batteries defending Alexandria. On 10 July,Vice Admiral Sir B. P. Seymour demanded that the forts, then being strengthened, be surrendered. The navies of other nations and all commercial shipping quickly sailed out of port. The Egyptians refused this demand and Queen Victoria&rsquo;s Navy cleared for action.

Pirates do not have an ounce of reflection and throw themselves headlong into the adventure, taking all the risks, regularly receiving memorable blows that would kill an average whale but which merely slow down the pirates. They are superstitious and have a kind of moral code of their own which is usually the cause of crazy situations.<br/><br/>This is a game for those who know nothing about navigation, sailing, geography in the seventeenth century nor anything too serious. There is no real immersion, just the &quot;color&quot; and laughing. Think of it as a pirate movie who will not teach you anything, but will give you a good time. Thanks to the rules, the GM has very little work and will mostly give story primers and hit back the PCs, the game will move on its own. The rules also encourage players to play together, not against each other.<br/><br/>The topic require some maturity, after all it is a question of murder, teasing ladies, drinking, rapine... This is a light and fun caricature of a world which in reality was much darker. Here beatings given or received have little importance, there is no display of blood or guts, just the infantile &quot;bam! you're dead&quot; and &quot;bing! in your teeth.&quot; You must also learn to accept the frequent disappointments that your character will suffer.<br/><br/>Pirates! differs from other games on the same theme by the extreme simplicity of the rules, the rather low preparation involved and the tone which is light hearted rather than epic.<br/><br/>"}, "138156": {"poll": [], "name": "Kerbal Space Program", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Macintosh Downloadable edition", "PSN PlayStation 4 Downloadable edition", "Windows Downloadable edition", "XBLA Xbox One Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1695388.png", "videogametheme": ["Flight", "Physics", "Space"], "usersrated": "31", "videogamedeveloper": ["Flying Tiger Entertainment", "Squad"], "videogamegenre": ["Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["Linux", "Macintosh", "PlayStation 4", "Windows", "Xbox One"], "videogamehonor": ["2013 Global Game Awards Best Sci-fi Game of the Year Winner", "2014 Game Developers Choice Awards Audience Award Winner", "2014 Game Developers Choice Awards Best New IP of the Year Nominee", "2014 IGF Awards Seumas McNally Grand Prize Nominee", "2015 Golden Joystick Best Indie Game of the Year Winner", "2016 D.I.C.E.

But still, it&rsquo;s quite necessary for envoys at least to explain the indigenes what are they talking about before persuading them to buy all these surely useful miracles of culture, science and engineering because the only way to talk to the Onkilons is in primitive pictograms which represent simple words such as &ldquo;fish&rdquo;, &ldquo;mother&rdquo;, &ldquo;egg&rdquo;, &ldquo;cold&rdquo; or &ldquo;above&rdquo;.<br/><br/>My Understands You is a board game of associations and creative thinking. Players one after another take a role of civilization ambassador, who should explain any expression of the modern world using simple images. Others play as the Onkilons and try to guess what the guest of the Big world is talking about. Victory points charge by right conjectures and understandable explanations. When everyone will play as an envoy for 2 to 5 times, depending to the number of players, the game ends and the winner is defined according to the earned points.<br/><br/>At the game beginning each player gets a set of the voting tiles with the numbers from 1 to 6 on them and 3 stake tiles: smoked herring, reindeer hide and mammoth tusk. By the way, players acquire 3 big cards with civilization achievements, 2 words on each (for example, &ldquo;oil derrick&rdquo;, &ldquo;backpack&rdquo;, &ldquo;deodorant&rdquo;, &ldquo;calculator&rdquo;) and 6 small cards with pictograms (such as &ldquo;woman&rdquo;, &ldquo;bird&rdquo;, &ldquo;loud&rdquo;, &ldquo;night&rdquo;).<br/><br/>Each turn the envoy puts his achievement cards in a column. Upper word or phrase is counted as the first, the one under it as the second and all way down to the lower as the sixth one. Then the envoy decides which of the achievements he will explain with the gained pictograms. He should use 2 or 3 small cards: for example, &ldquo;water&rdquo;, &ldquo;fire&rdquo; and &ldquo;below&rdquo; for &ldquo;oil derrick&rdquo;. After the decision about the achievement and its explanation he puts the needed small cards with face up and the number tile face down.<br/><br/>Other players acting as the Onkilons join the round. They try to guess which of 6 achievements the presenter is trying to show. They find the word or phrase on the big cards that is the most suitable for the played pictograms and lay out the appropriate number tiles face down as well. Also the indigenes need to use one of the stake tiles. Victory points depend on the stake if the word hypothesis will be right: 1 point for a herring, 2 for a hide and 3 for a tusk.<br/><br/>When all the Onkilons have made their choice, everyone turns the voting tiles face up to see who guessed the achievement correctly. If all the players guessed or nobody did (in other words, the explanation was very clear or too complicated), tribesmen get 1 point each and the ambassador has nothing. If the right choice was made only by few natives, they get points according to their stakes and the envoy gains points for the biggest stake of the correct answer. <br/>Ex-presenter takes new cards in exchange for used and hand over the turn.<br/><br/>My Understands You suits for the company of friends and for families as well. The most comfortable gameplay is for the 3-4 players &ndash; everyone can be a presenter for enough turns. Still the game can become longer for more player as well: achievement cards can be played for another round.

They allowed the new, not necessarily young, wargamer to fight the glorious actions they had heard about in their school history lessons. Often starting with the Battle of Waterloo as their first action, the general would deploy his hastily painted soldiers from Airfix&rsquo;s Napoleonic range. Airfix offered British and French infantry, as well as cavalry and guns for both sides.<br/><br/>Napoleonic tactics were simple in principle, but were hard to master in practice; for example infantry in a line maximized its firepower, but was vulnerable to cavalry. Changing to a square kept the infantry safe from the cavalry, but made them vulnerable to artillery and reduced their musketry to &frac14; of the unit&rsquo;s strength2. The games, just like the battles of history, were all about combining the efforts of the infantry, cavalry and artillery using &lsquo;combined arms tactics&rsquo; to sweep the enemy away. The key problem with these games was the &lsquo;helicopter overview&rsquo; of the action the players had of their largely divisional sized games. While representing the battles of the Napoleonic Wars in some ways, they did not recreate experience of the commanders of the time.<br/><br/>Paddy Griffith&rsquo;s excellent book aimed to fill the gap and offer no less than seven different sets of rules to simulate the experience of command at different levels. Just as the early wargamers took the Airfix Napoleonic&rsquo;s and converted them for use in a wide range of periods, the ideas offered by Paddy in these rules have equal potential to transform any wargamer&rsquo;s tabletop experience. I am very pleased for the opportunity to reprint this classic work.<br/><br/>This book contains no less than seven sets of rules:<br/><br/>Skirmish level<br/><br/>Divisional game<br/><br/>Brigade game<br/><br/>Army level game<br/><br/>Generalship game<br/><br/>Map Kriegsspiel<br/><br/>Tactic Exercises Without Troops<br/>&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "138173": {"poll": [], "name": "AirFrame", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1586558_t.jpg", "average": "4.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Precinct Omega Publishing"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1586558.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Aviation / Flight", "Science Fiction"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "A standalone miniatures wargame of future air superiority from One Pound Wargames, AirFrame allows players to assemble and customize their formation using existing air combat models from their collection.

Skirmishes are standalone games played for a single victory, with no lasting repercussions.  Campaigns are a series of skirmishes. In campaigns, players begin with a squad of recruit characters.<br/><br/>The game board for STA is built from modular tiles which are themed to represent different environments.  The default game board is a destroyed urban setting.  Players build the game board with nine modular tiles, each of which are divided into a 7x7 grid.  Characters use the grids for movement.<br/><br/>STA is a scenario driven game.  Each scenario typically has multiple objectives, and combat between factions is usually a secondary or tertiary objective.

Players can ram their opponent's cab to steal their fare or use the new interference feature to make them crash or slow down their fare delivery time.<br/><br/>Crazy Taxi: Fare Wars gives users the ability to record about 80 seconds of gameplay footage and then transfer it to a computer for media uses. Another feature unseen in previous Crazy Taxi games is the ability to play any MP3 files stores on a memory stick, in the game. Almost all of the sound effects have been re-recorded and are completely different than older versions of Crazy Taxi.<br/><br/>Differences<br/><br/>The original game's soundtracks contained songs by the bands Bad Religion and The Offspring has been removed, as well as many of the real-world stores in game, due to licensing issues, though many retain the iconic designs of copyrighted stores (eg. Pizza Parlor using Pizza Hut's iconic &quot;Red Roof&quot; prior to 1999). However, the game allows custom soundtracks; MP3 files stored on the memory stick can be played in-game.<br/><br/>Other differences include the afforementioned multiplayer via Ad-Hoc wireless, and game sharing, using only one copy of the game, and the ability to record your game footage; about 80 seconds of game footage is recordable and transferable.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Crazy Taxi: Fare Wars&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "138230": {"rpgartist": ["V.

However, the machine delights in being vague and twisted. A card reading &quot;Old Age&quot; could mean you die in your sleep at age 120, or it could mean you're run over tomorrow by an elderly driver who forgot to take his pills today. Players of the game take the role of assassins, who must use the various tools at their disposal -- from storytelling to a slew of items available from specialty Black Market shops -- to create a situation in which a target is killed in a way in line with their Death Prediction. The Machine of Death Game uses this basic idea, of assassins working in a world were cause of death is known to create various game modes.<br/><br/>The General Gameplay of most modes works like this:<br/><br/>     A target is assigned, and given certain details (including Death Prediction, and extra Intel details, such as things they particularly like or dislike &ndash; to help predict their behavior).<br/>     Players &ndash; assassins &ndash; are given Black Market Gift Cards. These are the items they are allowed to use in order to accomplish their goal: killing the target.<br/>     Players use the Gift Cards to devise a plan. Each Black Market card provides an item to be used in an Action. Three actions should chain together in some way that results in the death of the target. <br/>     The plan is greenlit, either by a Chief player, or via consensus, depending on game mode. <br/>     The timer starts and the plan is put into action. This is represented by dice rolling to beat a &quot;difficulty score.&quot; An unlikely plan hinging on a single item may need to roll a 6 for that Action, but a rock-solid intricate plan may need to only roll a 2 for each card. <br/>     The skull face on the die also adds a frantic element (replacing the 1 face, if the skull is rolled it prompts the flipping of a Fate Coin to add additional randomness). <br/>     In case of failure of any die roll, that Action didn't work, and the plan must be revised. While the timer continues running, the assassins draw a new Black Market item, amending their previous plan and rolling for a new Action. They may also call in &quot;Specialists&quot;, who are characters with special skills (earned in previous rounds).<br/>     If any three Actions are successful before the timer runs out, the target is killed. With the remaining time, the players may roll for Aftermath tasks (such as fleeing the scene or destroying the evidence). Completion of these tasks earns Specialist cards to be used in later rounds. This is the only way to replenish the group's overall Budget of playable cards.<br/>     If the timer runs out before three Actions are completed, the target escapes. This is the end of the round.<br/>     In the published rules, this also ends the game. This rule was subsequently revised, allowing players to make another attempt on the same target, or take the loss and move on to additional targets. Hard-core players may end the game at this point.<br/>     The team wins if they can accomplish four successful kills before their total Budget of Black Market cards are exhausted.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Game Variants:<br/><br/>     Chief Mode is where one player takes on the gamemaster role of the Chief, answering questions and deciding on the difficulty of the plan being created by the other players. Groups of 4 or more work best in this mode. In groups of 2-3 players, each player states their opinion, and the hardest value is the one used.<br/>     Psychopath is similar to Cards Against Humanity or Apples to Apples. Each player holds a hand of Death Prediction cards that represent hostages. One psychopath announces a murder weapon (based on a drawn Black Market card), and players each toss in the hostage they believe will be most likely to be killed by that weapon. Designed for 4+ players.<br/>     Speed Round is faster-paced and useful for introducing players to the death prediction concept. One Chief presents the Death Prediction Card of an assassination target, and players rush to play a Black Market or Specialist card that they think can kill the person in the predicted way. The Chief assigns a difficulty value to the fastest player's proposed plan, and the player rolls to see if they can pull it off. If they do, they earn that Death Prediction Card as a point; if they fail, another player may propose a plan. <br/>     Mechanical Chief uses 14 regular playing cards to replace the subjective judgments of the Chief. Each Black Market card is dealt with a playing card, the value of which is kept hidden until the die is about to be rolled. This variant is good for faster play, and directs discussions toward justifying the revealed values within the story, rather than debating the merits of various plans.<br/>     Teams is useful for very large groups. The players split into two rival assassination teams, and alternate attacking targets, with a single Chief moderating.

The rules are available from the designer's blog and consist of separate cover and body documents.  The cover includes a cover page (blank), title page and table of contents, the body document contains the rules alone.<br/><br/>From the Introduction:<br/>Welcome to a fantasy world where the men are Baldrick, the dwarves are punk, and the dogs are small but vicious. Welcome to a world of bawds, grave robbers, excisemen and witch hunters; a place where &ldquo;Blather&rdquo;, &ldquo;Flee!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mime&rdquo; are legitimate skill choices; and where all material on the insidious threat of Chaos is officially interchangeable between settings.<br/><br/>Welcome (back) to the Grim World of Perilous Adventure.<br/><br/>Whisper it (that fanboys may not hear and descend a squealing), but for all the charm of its skewed familiar 16th century milieu and the lurking horror of Chaos, Warhammer Fantasy Role Play was little more than a modcop of classic Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Yes, our beloved WFRP was yet another &lsquo;fix D&amp;D&rsquo; fantasy heartbreaker, albeit one which had the clout of the biggest name in British gaming behind it. Whole chunks of the system were lightly disguised D&amp;D mechanics adapted to a roll under d% system1, and many setting<br/>elements not gleefully ripped off from Tolkien, Leiber or Moorcock were already established D&amp;D tropes by the time WFRP was published.<br/><br/>But that's ok. Indeed, that's part of why all right thinking people &ndash; Brits, Italians and Poles especially &ndash; love WFRP. To paraphrase a better man than I: we took an American invention, soaked it in a witches' brew of Bosch, Durer and Dor&eacute;, Mervyn Peake and Tom Sharpe, Blackadder, The Young Ones, pints of bitter, cheap weed, Iron Maiden and The Damned, and then we played the hell out of it.<br/><br/>And that&rsquo;s what this ill considered rules hack is about. Your humble author &ndash; a dirty little yahoo from a rainy, grimy, post imperial isle in the northern seas &ndash; decided to have a go at welding D&amp;D and WFRP together. Why? So I could play games of WFRP ish misery and despair with rules of B/X ish brevity, thus achieving personal gaming nirvana. This here resulting travesty is a 90% pure game mechanics kitbash with minimal background material or context.

Izamu is an ancient blood thirsty warlord that lived during the old days of the Katanaka clan that Yan Lo was also a member of. Today, he is called upon by Yan Lo to bring death to all those that oppose him.<br/><br/>Izamu's mobility is pretty unimpressive with a bog standard 4/6 move/charge and only one mobility trick to speak of which is Shove Aside (allows Izamu to nove through ht1 and 2 models). He does have a very respectable 3&quot; melee range though. He also benefits greatly from mobility tricks given by other models, be it the Soul Porter with Empower Ancestor, Toshiro with Tenki no Juden or Molly and Imbue Vigor.<br/><br/>Now we are cooking with gas! Izamus is a melee monster packing Melee Expert, a base + to all his damage flips, a respectable combat of 6 on a range 3 weapon and a very nice damage spread of 3/4/6. That damage spread is his edge compared to the dead rider, Izamu can nuke a most low mid cost models in one severe strike. He also has a cute trigger with his Daodao that lets his weapon be considered magical if you get a tome which is nice since it's a suit ressers don't use much and is always nice to have that possibility when facing spirit heavy crews.<br/><br/>Ironically, Izamu does not even have an armour rating. Instead he is an Object 2, which is actually better. This means he is reducing 2 damage from anything heading his way unless it ignores object and for now, very few things actually do that. His tankiness doesn't end there, he is also immune to influence, so WP strikes do nothing against him. He is able to nullify enemy triggers if he cheats fate on his defense and resist flips, the suit of the card he uses to cheat will not cause any of the triggers the enemy may be packing, so Lady Justice getting you down? cheat with a Ram and yeah, you may be taking the hit, but there is no onslaught or critical strike going in with it.<br/><br/>"}, "138423": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Ananda Gupta", "Jason Matthews"], "statistics": [], "bgaccessoryversion": ["Deluxe Third Edition"], "boardgameartist": ["Viktor Csete", "Rodger B.

Each player takes control of one or more agents with unique powers to defend the planet from the alien invasion. Gameplay revolves around a tactical combat system, using custom ten-sided dice. Each player sequentially plays his Agent turn and then one Aliens turn. Players carry out their turns [agent and aliens] in clockwise order until the last player finishes his Aliens turn. Once done, the game passes to the Event phase that will bring the players to the next round. Players may choose up to five agents:<br/><br/><br/>    Marine: Coming from U.S. Special Forces, the Marine is an excellent soldier who can manage different combat situations, especially multiple enemies.<br/>    Biotech: The Biotech is the most technologically adept agent in service. He can use Nano-Technology to heal wounds or control war drones.<br/>    Infiltrator: A deadly and stealthy agent. This lethal specialist prefers hiding in the shadows. She has fast movement and good short-range combat ability.<br/>    Sniper: A silent sharpshooter and expert in camouflage and ranged combat. The sniper has average movement and excellent long-range firepower.<br/>    Hulk: The Hulk was a successful mercenary and now is one of the best agents; although slow, he enjoys an extraordinary resistance to damage and has high firepower.<br/><br/><br/>There is no &quot;Alien player&quot; in Galaxy Defenders; instead, the aliens are controlled by the game system itself, through an artificial intelligence system based on two types of cards:<br/><br/><br/>    Alien cards, which define the behavior of each different alien and detail its skills and combat abilities.<br/>    Close Encounter cards, which are used at the beginning of each alien turn to determine which aliens activate.<br/><br/><br/>The combination of a unique AI for each alien species and the uncertainty about alien activation in a turn provides a realistic simulation of the chaos of battle and a sophisticated challenge for the players. Since having more agents brings more alien activations for the aliens, the turn structure allows the level of difficulty to scale dynamically based on the number of agents in play. If agents die during the game, the system &quot;recalibrates&quot; the difficulty to a reasonable and enjoyable level, so you still have a chance to complete the mission.<br/><br/>The battle for Earth will be carried out in a series of twelve missions organized in a completely story-driven campaign. Mission events influence future games in two different ways:<br/><br/><br/>    Each mission has multiple endings, and the outcome of any mission will change the flow of the story.<br/>    The agents gain experience during the missions. This experience transforms a good soldier into a perfect Galaxy Defender agent with multiple skills, basic and improved tactics, and the ability to use new devices, improved human weapons, and Alien technology.<br/><br/><br/>With the downloadable Galaxy Defenders: Alien Mind variant, you can transform the game into a competitive affair, with one player becoming the alien mastermind and controlling the alien army and the card in play, attempting to thwart each mission undertaken by the Agents. To do this, the alien player completes his own game objectives, obtaining new &quot;alien signals&quot; that can be teleported onto the battlefield. This variant, which allows for play with up to six players, can be used in a single mission or for a whole campaign of Galaxy Defenders. Using Alien Mind may increase the game difficulty and is suggested only for expert players.<br/><br/>Official FAQ: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.galaxy-defenders.com/faq.php' rel='nofollow'>http://www.galaxy-defenders.com/faq.php</a><br/>Additional Missions: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.galaxy-defenders.com/mission.php' rel='nofollow'>http://www.galaxy-defenders.com/mission.php</a><br/>Galaxy Ball: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.galaxy-defenders.com/gb-cards.php' rel='nofollow'>http://www.galaxy-defenders.com/gb-cards.php</a><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "German first edition"], "average": "7.54476", "name": "Galaxy Defenders", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Modular Board", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["Galaxy Ball", "Galaxy Defenders Agent: Niobium", "Galaxy Defenders Agent: Tritium", "Galaxy Defenders Master Alien: Kingator", "Galaxy Defenders Master Alien: The Experiment", "Galaxy Defenders Master Alien: Xeno-Lord", "Galaxy Defenders: 5th Column", "Galaxy Defenders: Close Encounter Danger Variant Cards", "Galaxy Defenders: Elite Alien Army", "Galaxy Defenders: Elite Alien Legion", "Galaxy Defenders: Extinction Protocol", "Galaxy Defenders: Operation Strikeback", "Galaxy Defenders: Vintage Weapon Set 1"], "usersrated": "1140", "boardgameaccessory": ["Galaxy Defenders: Special Dice"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games", "Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Aliens", "Campaign Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Solitaire Games"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 22 - We All Stand Together", "I've Been Diced! episode 62: Our 2014 in review"]}, "138432": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1617510.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Darrell Louder"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Darrell Louder"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Greater Than Games (Dice Hate Me Games)"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1617510_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Expansion for Base-game", "Industry / Manufacturing"], "description": "The Chemical Chaos promotional expansion pack adds 14 new Compounds and 1 additional Lab Fire to your game of Compounded.

She creates and spreads woods terrain, and then makes that woods terrain very scary for her enemies. She retains most of the abilities of her pre-Avatar form, though many become more woods-dependent. Lilith also gains some very useful long-range attacks and damage effects, which can assist in pushing opponents around and controlling board position.<br/><br/>In Avatar Form, Lilith suddenly needs to worry about two things that didn't matter as much before, woods terrain and Blood Tokens.<br/><br/>Woods Terrain: An overwhelming portion of Lilith's Actions, Spells, and Attacks work only in woods terrain, or work much better in woods terrain. Lilith wants to stay near the woods, and to keep her enemies near the woods too. Place your initial woods terrain carefully, keeping near any objective locations and any likely spots for enemies to congregate. Be sure your Illusionary Forest is in a good place, too, before you Manifest Lilith's Avatar. You can spread woods further from these existing locations, using Lilith's Sanguine Proliferation spell. This requires a 9 card or better, and suits don't matter, so you should plan to have a card in hand for it in case your flip isn't enough. This growth can seem very slow, however, since you can only expand by 3&quot; for every action, so it's usually best to do this only if you're setting up an immediate attack on an opponent who's not quite in reach of the forest on Lilith's turn. Note also that Sanguine Proliferation costs a Blood Token, which can be in short supply.<br/><br/>Gaining Blood Tokens: If you're fighting against living or Undead opponents, Lilith can usually gain a Blood Token every time something dies: anyone killed by her Nature's Revenge spell, or killed within 8&quot; of her and in base contact with a woods terrain, generates a Blood Token. Note that you also generate Blood Tokens when your own models are killed within 8&quot; of Lilith if they're in base contact with a woods terrain. Lilith's most likely crews (Nephilim and Waldgeists) are all considered living, so this may provide some benefit or at least consolation. She can also gain a Blood Token when she kills a living or Undead unit by using Drain Blood, but this is a (0) Action so she can only use it once per round. Note, though, that if your enemy has a lot of Constructs, Nightmares, Objects, Spirits, or Soulless models, these won't give you any Blood Tokens so it may not be worth Manifesting.<br/><br/>Spending Blood Tokens: While pre-Manifest Lilith only really keeps her Blood Tokens to feed her young or try to meet a scheme for VP, in Avatar form she has tremendous need of Blood Tokens. Avatar Lilith uses Blood Tokens to use her Erupting Underbrush mass melee attack, to expand the woods with her Sanguine Proliferation spell (though she can use Blood Tokens from nearby minions within 6&quot; instead for this), and to attack units with her Nature's Revenge spell (though this may also give her Blood Tokens back, possibly generating a profit if she kills a lot of wounded minions). On top of this, she can also use Blood Tokens to grow and mature her Nephilim. The demand and uses of Blood Tokens are quite high for Lilith, so take some care in choosing the right way to spend a Token. A good general rule is: if it's going to kill at least one enemy model, it's worth spending a Blood Token, especially if that model is living or Undead. Otherwise, the Blood Token is probably better spent growing a Terror Tot.<br/><br/>Card Flow Control: Avatar Lilith retains her Rush of Magic Ability and Bloody Fate trigger, so you will often pull a card and discard it during play. This doesn't give you more control cards, but it can be a helpful way of raising the average value of your cards and helping you find the Mask (or occasionally Crows) cards you need. Remember to use these card flow effects, since they will help refine your hand.<br/><br/>"}, "138448": {"poll": [], "name": "Malifaux: Ophelia Born on the Bayou", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven"], "yearpublished": "0", "boardgameexpansion": ["Malifaux"], "usersrated": "5", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1571714_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Wyrd Miniatures"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1571714.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy", "Horror", "Miniatures"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki:<br/><br/>Ophelia is a gunfighter, capable of dishing out good amounts of damage from a distance.

With over two hundred unique unit types the variety is endless.<br/><br/>All units in Runestar are made using a mathematical formula, so all army lists start from a level-playing field.

With five Era's worth of fantastical history, players can re-fight legendary battles in the Runestar canon or forge the future in the fires of war.<br/><br/>The one-roll combat system (attacker strength + defender weakness = to-hit roll) ensures that games play swiftly, and the mighty D12 allows for plenty of variation between units whilst keeping things slick.<br/><br/>The Rune-magick system is unique. Mages combine rune cards to form spells, stacking the abilities of different runes on top of each other to create their own chants. Players must use their own initiative to cast magick effectively, and the creative possibilities are boundless.<br/><br/>Magick items are extremely rare, and most champions must rely on runic blades which need to be charged by mages to have any special effects.

The object of the game is to reach the top of the Crag, retrieve the Scroll, and then make it off the Crag again. The game board is defined as a series 49 four inch squares arranged in four tiers. The top tier is the peak of Star Snag Crag.<br/><br/>Each player controls a team, or Quad, made up of 4 different specialists, selected from the 8 possible types listed in the game. Some types focus on mobility, others on combat, and some, like the Beastmastr [sic], level the playing field with unusual abilities. These character types also rely on items (magical &amp; non-magical) to give them an edge in certain situations.<br/><br/>Each turn the players perform game actions in a set order of phases: Activation, Movement, Exploration and Occurrences (weather effects or wandering monsters), Conflict Resolution, and Evening (a time of healing and recharging). Both players act simultaneously so occasionally members of one Quad will end up in conflict with each other quite by accident. Random game elements can also send creatures or primitives to attack members of a Quad. Terrain effects are randomly determined the first time the member of a Quad enters a new square. These effects can produce anything from a Refreshing Spring to a Dragon Nest.<br/><br/>Unlike most miniatures game, death isn't a feature of Piptwynn's Scroll. When one side wins a conflict, the other side is driven away. Since this is fundamentally a race to the peak of Star Snag Crag, getting pushed back on any given turn can make the difference between winning and losing. In this way the game is more family-friendly than the many miniatures games that focus on death and dismemberment.<br/><br/>The rulebook also contains several rules variants, including set up a larger board for tournament play. Also included are reproducible sheets, charts, tokens, etc., along with tips on how to paint miniatures and how to build a proper three-dimensional game board. (Players must provide their own miniatures, a playing surface--which can be simple map or more traditional war game terrain, and a set of polyhedral dice)<br/><br/>There were several planned follow-up games for this title, including an RPG crossover.
