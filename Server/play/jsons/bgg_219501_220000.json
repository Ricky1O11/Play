Then. 1978.<br/><br/>&quot;In those early days, she vibrated with occult activity. Forests fringing the north of the town glowed bright with the light of burning torches. Hooded figures murmured in underground temples. People, unprepared for the rise of eldritch phenomena, were shocked by events that seemed biblical in tone. The police seemed powerless, or somehow snared within a web of occult corruption. A once green and pleasant land was swollen with a deep, unwholesome energy and the air crackled and sparked like a living entity.<br/><br/>&quot;Those were the last days of the Earth. Though we didn't know it at the time; these were the death throes of life as we knew it.<br/><br/>&quot;Did they come from unfathomable voids between the stars? Did they rise from the murky depths of ocean trenches, or oblivion sockets hidden far below ground? Nobody of this time - of the After Years - knows which doom was the one true doom.<br/><br/>&quot;Perhaps all were triggers for armageddon, each playing a part in man's final perdition. Perhaps something else was to blame. It hardly seems relevant in these latter days, when nothing but staying alive consumes our every waking thought.<br/><br/>&quot;We who survive know only that the Earth was transformed and the great works of man obliterated overnight. The mundane - all so firm in its foundations; immovable and vibrant - shifted by degrees and the cities, civilizations, lights and laughter of our world fell away, replaced by the dark... and The Mist.<br/><br/>&quot;In place of our towns and cities came their monoliths, architectures belched forth from the diseased minds of ineffable, unknowable designers. In place of our sprawling society and concrete realms, the earth fell away into pits of empty shadow and spearing mountains of green mold-obsidien, like lime coloured ice lancing into shattered skies. Their mountains. Their skies.<br/><br/>&quot;No builders from an alien realm erected these mausoleum cities. They simply arrived, unfolding from the inner realm of nightmares in ways that made them seem - to those of us who witnessed their coming - as though they had been there all along, patiently awaiting this apocalypse dawn.<br/><br/>&quot;Out of such necropolis towns came tendril mists, rolling like dragon-breath across the fields and downs of our homeland. And from the cold, white gloom came shapes and silhouettes whose very forms were a blasphemy against nature. They writhed, seethed and hissed in their idyll, alpha predators to whom all the world and all worlds were now prey.<br/><br/>&quot;We call it The Morbus. Not a fog but The Fog - a relentless, diseased mist from which nothing escapes. It drifts over the hills and about the roots of those livid, alien mountains. It slides across the grey ruins of our fallen homes and our wastelands alike. It hides Them - the stalking horrors whose piping and hooting portends imminent death and whose all-permeating mould-stench chokes the air with an inescapable reek of decay.<br/><br/>&quot;They are the things that dwell within the mist, born from who dares know where or what. Stealthy, furtive and sly, they slide on slick coils or scrabble on deformed limbs until that moment when prey comes within reach and suddenly all turns to whiplash violence, screams and blood. No more need for creeping. No more need to hide and watch. The nights are always filled with the sound of their feasting.<br/><br/>&quot;Midwich. Now. 1985.<br/><br/>&quot;Seven years have passed and somehow, against all the odds, we few prevail.

The crew of the Galaxy Voyager have crashed landed on the planet Nephilim. The giants there genetically have weak senses and are officious, oafish, ignorant dullards. They are also insufferable cowards and sexually licentious (despite, surprisingly, their low-birth rate and ruthless State-enforced biological infanticide campaigns for 'Those Unfit For Life'). Their low-birthrate and survival unto adulthood combines with their cowardice to make them reluctant to close for combat. However, they will always attempt to capture human earthlings due to fascist government directives and they fear their tyrannical police state more than their natural and selfish instincts. The capture policy is because the planet of Nephilim has spied Earth and its tiny Earthmen across space and are greedy for Earth's water and resources but lack the sufficient technology in space travel to get there. The fascist giant government sees it as imperative to capture the lost humans' small spacecraft to use their miniaturisation and macro- and retro-engineering on to gain space flight They have gluttonous appetites that will distract them easily. Average Nephilim may lift their own body weight and carry it at normal movement encumbrance Giant society has a fiat, non-precious metal and paper currency and does not favour the use of precious metals or jewels to enhance themselves which they see as garish and effete. The giants speak a form of English that is distinctly flavoured unto itself with a slur. S.I.G. is a world government and there are different races of Nephilim of different colouration and racial abilities. Nephilim live to the age of 140 years but suffer dementia by 120 years. Nephilim is ruled over by a tyrannical bureaucracy known as 'The S.I.G.' (&quot;Signals Intelligence Group&quot;). S.I.G. members, known as Inquisitors, wear sharp and stylish black leather coats and leggings with paramilitary insignia and trench coats. The S.I.G. has the fascist and corporatist leash on life and death over the other Nephilim inhabitants of the planet who are too slovenly and stupid to stir or revolt. Instead they revel in being subjected to despotism where oppression is a cultural meme. Surveillance is central to this society where each Nephilim is constantly informing on the activities and suspected activities of his fellows. An old Nephilim witticism goes: &quot;Why didn't anyone on Nephilim see last night's Inquisitor-General's report on the synth-box? Because they were all out checking in their neighbours' windows to see if they were dutifully watching the broadcast ...&quot;. The levels of suspicion created by Nephilim society is positively overheated and paranoid.

June 20th, 2016 A.D.: Over 3,000 tourists are killed at Teotihuacan by a blinding, searing light. The bodies remain bleaching in the sun, unable to be recovered by authorities. What is the mystery of Teotihuacan and its strange ziggurats dedicated to Solrac Votan??? On June 20th as over 3,000 visitors crowded the Avenue of the Dead of the Teotihuacan, the solar god of the Votan &ndash; Solrac Votan &ndash; returned in a burning, incinerating intervention. Solrac Votan, god of the Votans, immediately inhabited the Temple of the Sun in its lower chambers and began his cosmic countdown: in exactly 6 months Solrac Votan will burst from the ziggurat and rampage across the Earth, destroying it with the additional powers he has meanwhile gained. With the solar intervention of Solrac Votan on the Avenue of the Dead at Teotihuacan on the June 20th solstice, Mexican military authorities established a 6 mile radius cordon perimeter around the site.

The campaign&rsquo;s beginning date is what is suspected to be (and has been ordained by the surviving elites) the 1st of January, 2080 AD. A shattered civilization reels on its knees to regain its balance. A world thrust inexplicably into a technological Dark Ages of the 600s-1200s AD. MIRVed ballistic missiles replaced with wooden and stone clubs. Electricity: a mystical wonder of the perhaps-magical elite. Mutation and desolation. A neo-feudalism descends on Earth&hellip; Details are sketchy in the physical remnants of libraries and media outlets hit hard in the prolonged nuclear exchange now referred to as &lsquo;The Social Wars&rsquo;.

The correct date as per the now-operational UKBC is set at January 1st, 2080 AD (United Kingdom Broadcasting Center which is again kept broadcasting constantly in the prospect should any of the now-lost ex-British N-sub flotilla ever re-crew, reactivate, find no signal, loose its missiles and restart a limited nuclear exchange with &ldquo;The Combine&rdquo;). &lsquo;Yew-Kay-Bee-See&rsquo; (actually UKBC - the transmissions and bunker area of the UKBC, the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Broadcasting Centre, 60 miles north of Old London) - cult among Commoners and primitives with radio access.

Do you have the wits to survive, with other participants, on a deserted tropical island? Or simply want to win $1,000,000? If so, HUNGER is searching for self-reliant contestants to attempt this bold adventure.<br/><br/>HUNGER is a fast paced family game with rich player interaction. To win, you have to predict your opponent&rsquo;s actions. On the island, you can gather fruit and catch chickens to get more food. But to win, you also have to collect raft pieces. It's a good thing that no one would ever think of stealing food and raft parts from other participants...<br/><br/>HUNGER is a family/filler game for 2-6 players, ages 7 and above, lasting 20 minutes.<br/><br/>Story: Welcome to HUNGER Reality Show! There is a 1 Million Dollar Prize and there can only be one winner. Alongside other participants, unfortunately not your best friends, you are cast onto a desert island. There is some food provided by the TV crew but it will not last long. You will be hungry very soon and will have to start picking fruit or catching chickens. You will also need to build a raft if you are serious about winning the prize. The first person to leave the island will be declared as winner. You will need rope and raft wood, which are hard to find. Well, you could always try to steal from the others, but would you?<br/><br/>Mechanic: Players simultaneously choose their next action and destination on the island. To be successful, players need to predict the other players' actions but also stay focused on their goal: having enough food to survive the next day (or otherwise being evacuated by the film crew according to the principle &lsquo;your safety is our highest priority&rsquo;) and building the raft as quickly as possible. Balancing those needs is key to winning the game. This is what makes the game so broadly appreciated among gamers but also non-gamers, families and children. The game is fast, smooth and easy to play and has no downtime, while allowing for a lot of player interactions. The better player will on average usually win most games but it is possible for a 7-year-old to win on occasion too, which makes the game a fun experience for everyone.<br/><br/>"}, "219671": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Printer-Friendly PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Prison of Eternal Torture", "rpgdesigner": ["Thomas Huff"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3384614.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Dungeon Module J"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3384614_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>South of the city of Leoben lays the small island of Krisaga.

You may even befriend the local merchant with the game's brilliant purchasing system.<br/><br/>OBJECT OF THE GAME:<br/> To mine the caverns below and find an ancient vain of untold riches. Only then may you stake your claim to the Stone Throne. You do this by mining and fighting your fellow Dwarves, buying new items and weapons in order to mine faster and find missing clues as to the location of the fathers gift.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY:<br/>- Each player chooses a Dwarf to play as, Each dwarf has their own special skill set and abilities. <br/>-Once chosen each player get a chance to purchase items from the local merchant.<br/>- A map is then chosen and all players enter that map.

And, for an equal measure of time, riches have flowed like water from its gates, courtesy of The Father&rsquo;s Gift, a legendary vein of ore said to make even the vast riches of the ancient kings seem like mere trinkets in comparison.<br/><br/>Under the rule of the Irongaard clan, there came a time of prosperity, peace, and trade with the neighboring kingdoms. But the opulence of the dwarves also attracted attention of a less savory nature. The greedy eyes of heathen beasts, and bandits were ever vigilant in searching for avenues that would allow them to take, either by force or guile, the riches of the dwarves and claim them for their own.<br/><br/>The dwarves were unbending in their defense, though, and they kept their foes at bay, repelling attack after attack. But their enemies were persistent. Every bauble they stole, no matter how small, served only to further incite their greed.<br/><br/>In time, their patience paid off. The tunnels beneath the Godsfell Mountains were numerous and, even after centuries of diligent exploration by the dwarves, many remained unexplored. Eventually, a way in was found, one that would bypass the nearly impenetrable gates that served as Stonewatch&rsquo;s vanguard.<br/><br/>Following this discovery, a great conclave was called among the dwarves&rsquo; many enemies. After much petty squabbling, they pledged to form a dark alliance aimed at crushing Stonewatch and seizing the Father&rsquo;s Gift from the great kingdom that had so long vexed them.<br/><br/>So it was that the Great War began during the watch of Gildor Irongaard, seventh king of his line.<br/><br/><br/>     * *<br/><br/><br/>Now, the war is finally over. With the swing of an axe, the head of Gorve Bloodclaw, mightiest of the heathen beasts chieftains, was cleaved from his shoulders. Their morale broken, the remnants of his forces scattered, bringing to an end the years of misery and bloodshed.<br/><br/>The victory has been a costly one, though. Stonewatch lies in ruins. Gildor Irongaard is dead, along with his sons. No king sits upon the Stone Throne. Worst of all, the Father&rsquo;s Gift has been lost, the mines leading to it having been collapsed to prevent their enemies from gaining a toehold.<br/><br/>It is a dark time for the dwarves, but perhaps it need not be.<br/><br/>There are rumors that the many battles of the war opened up new tunnels to the deep, passages previously unknown. Perhaps one of these will lead back to the Gift, allowing its riches to once more inspire the dwarven people with the drive they need to rebuild their once great civilization.<br/><br/>Whoever can find it will be hailed a hero and savior. The Stone Throne will be theirs for the taking.<br/><br/>Will you undertake this quest? Are you brave enough to explore the dark confines of collapsed tunnels, abandoned mines, and whatever may be waiting inside of them? Are you clever enough to outsmart those who are likewise searching for the Father&rsquo;s Gift?<br/><br/>Only time will tell if you have what it takes to survive what lies beneath.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition"], "age": "12", "name": "Beneath", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Player Elimination", "Role Playing"], "average": "10", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "219704": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Kuro"], "poll": [], "name": "Pocket Pharmacy", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3432674_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "Manifest Destiny"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3432674.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Japanese/English edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Dice", "Fantasy", "Medical"], "age": "14", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "A dice game where you brew potions out of 5 different ingredients.

Your team has been charged with confiscating these items and returning them to their proper locations in time, so you now need to infiltrate the mansion and abscond with four items before Prof. Evil can secret four of them in locations inaccessible to you. Thankfully the old soul is a bit daft and won't evaporate you should he catch you lurking through the mansion, but simply scoot you out the front door where he'll forget about you immediately.<br/><br/>On a turn, you first draw and reveal two cards from your tiny deck, then keep one of the cards based on what you think will help you this turn. You then take three actions, such as open a door in the room you're in, move from a room (or outside) to another room (assuming the door is open), disable a trap, or grab a treasure; using a card isn't an action unless it says otherwise. You can repeat actions as desired or needed, but you can't enter a room with Prof. Evil and you can't exit the house on your own (in order to run across the grounds to another window) once you enter. You're now committed to grabbing those treasures!<br/><br/>After you finish your turn, Prof. Evil now moves, but again he's not all there, so he doesn't necessarily move in a logical manner. To move him, you roll three dice: One die advances the secondary Prof. Evil figure on the clock on the board either five or ten minutes; the other two determine where Prof. Evil moves and how far. What's more, as he walks through rooms, he closes the doors through which he travels and reactivates any inactive traps he encounters. If you roll a blue and a 1, for example, he moves through the blue doorway into the next adjacent room; a red and a 3 will move him through three rooms, walking through the red doorway each time. A color and a particular signal will teleport him immediately to the treasure bearing the same colored marker.<br/><br/>Let's look at these treasures in more detail: Each treasure shows a time value and one or more traps on it. Three treasures are placed on the board, then a blue, red and green token are placed on the treasures, with a matching blue, red and green token placed on the game board clock on the time matching what's on the treasure. The Magna Carta might say 45 minutes, for example, and after placing a blue token on the Magna Carta, you place a blue token on the clock 45 minutes away from where the Prof. Evil figure is located. If Prof. Evil moves onto this token on the clock, then that treasure is lost &mdash; and if you lose four treasures, then you've lost the game. Remove it from play and replace it with a new treasure, marking the proper time on the clock.<br/><br/>Note that you can't just grab a treasure, however. Professor Evil can't be in the same room (of course), but you also must ensure that all the traps shown on the treasure are currently deactivated. The game board starts with eight traps on it &mdash; half active, half not &mdash; and you'll play tug-of-war with Professor Evil over keeping them in this status. Collect a treasure, and a new one will be added to the game board; collect four treasures before Prof. Evil does, and you all win Professor Evil and The Citadel of Time.<br/><br/>"}, "219710": {"rpgdesigner": ["Tracy Hickman"], "rpgitemversion": ["Manuscript Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Orthanc: The Dark Seed Quest", "rpgartist": ["Tracy Hickman"], "rpgproducer": ["Tracy Hickman"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3387230.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Middle-earth"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["AD&D First Edition (1e) Compatible Products", "Unpublished Prototypes"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Unpublished)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3387230_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>This scenario describes the entry level and two of the dungeon levels of Saruman's tower of Orthanc, based on an alternate history of Tolkien's Middle-earth.  In the scenario, Orthanc has been abandoned and largely is in ruins.<br/><br/>The scenario is an unpublished manuscript - Tracy and Laura Hickman papers for Orthanc role-playing game; MSS 8180; Tracy and Laura Hickman papers; L. Tom Perry Special Collections; Literary Manuscripts; 1130 Harold B. Lee Library; Brigham Young University; Provo, Utah 84602.<br/><br/>The scenario has a manila card cover with (apparently) professionally printed graphics.  The text is typewritten, single-sided pages, with numbering.  Several maps are included, many of them laminated.  Not all maps are labeled, however.  The scenario is three-hole punched.  The scenario includes about twenty pages of maps and notes from an unrelated science-fiction scenario.<br/><br/>The scenario is divided into three &quot;chapters&quot;.  Each chapter begins with a 2-3 page fictional introduction and then proceeds to a keyed room-by-room description of a single level of the tower.<br/><br/>Chapter 1 describes &quot;The Hall of the March of Kings&quot;, which is the main entrance level of the tower.  Based on illustrations included in the manuscript, this entrance level is well above ground level, accessed through a long and steep set of stairs.  The original function of the level was the &quot;reception of guests&quot;.  The level consists of seventeen keyed areas, and opponents include bandits, a gelatinous cube, and an evil cleric.  It is unclear whether levels above the entrance level were contemplated.<br/><br/>Chapter 2 describes &quot;Oracles &amp; The Tower Guard&quot;, which is the level beneath the entrance level.  The original function of the level was the &quot;housing and care of tower guards&quot; and also for &quot;mining rich ore&quot; and &quot;slave quarters&quot;.  The ore referred to appears to have been external to the tower.  The level consists of thirty keyed areas, and opponents include a gelatinous cube, zombies, orcs, a sixth-level magic user, and a trapper.<br/><br/>Chapter 3 describes &quot;Lockholes&quot;, which is the next level down.  The original function of the level was &quot;prisoner security&quot; and the provision of &quot;support areas&quot; for the guard.  The level appears as a maze of corridors with numerous small rooms (&quot;lockholes&quot;) used as prison cells.  The level consists of thirty-five keyed areas (many containing multiple cells), and opponents include giant centipedes, orcs, and two seventh-level evil clerics.  This level is unique in providing a partially complete table of random encounters (&quot;wandering monsters&quot;).<br/><br/>Numerous maps are included in the scenario:<br/><br/><br/>        Unlabeled partial lower level<br/>        Laminated unlabeled level (probably level 1)<br/>        Two illustrations that appear to be simple maps<br/>        Laminated &quot;Level G&quot;, subtitled &quot;Seeds of Saruman Quest&quot;<br/>        Three minor variants of a map labeled &quot;Level III Orthank&quot; (note &quot;k&quot;); two are laminated, one appears to be a play-generated map<br/>        Two unlabeled maps - based on the keyed areas and the rooms these almost certainly are the third level &quot;lockholes&quot;; one appears to be a design balance tally - they are significantly different from the three &quot;Level III Orthank&quot; maps noted above<br/>        Two minor variants of a map labeled &quot;Level 5 Treasure Hold&quot;; one is laminated; one appears to be a design balance tally; they both note the level as 165 rooms<br/>        Unlabeled map<br/>        Unlabeled map and on reverse several unlabeled map fragments<br/><br/><br/>These two maps appear related to each other but likely are not part of the scenario (though included with it) - they are on different graph paper and have a different visual appearance:<br/><br/><br/>        Unlabeled map with fragment of second map<br/>        Unlabeled map<br/><br/><br/>Four pages of illustrations of the tower are provided; it has a unique outline - and appears to be in good repair (as illustrated).  One illustration appears to show the tower floating in air (may simply be an incomplete rendering).<br/><br/>General comments.  The manuscript is available for public access in a controlled reading room environment (photography, copies, etc., are not permitted).  The loose pages in the manuscript are stored in a folder and the pages are mingled with approximately 20 pages from an obviously unrelated science-fiction locale.  The page count indicated here is a &quot;best estimate&quot; because it's unclear whether all maps belong to the scenario and because many maps have duplicate copies.  The design suggests at least a few more deep levels were contemplated.  The scenario is more developed than most &quot;homebrew&quot; dungeons, but not as developed as a commercial module.  The fusion of proprietary game system with unrelated proprietary setting indicates the scenario probably was not contemplated for commercial release.  The scenario appears to date from about 1980.<br/><br/>"}, "219711": {"rpgdesigner": ["Peter Dell'Orto", "W. A. Frick", "Cole M.B.

Each player takes on the role of a brave adventurer, making their way through a series of dark dungeons. Your goal is to find treasure while avoiding creatures and other obstacles, like traps and locked doors. You&rsquo;ll have some help along the way in the form of useful equipment and beneficial encounters.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>60 Dungeon Cards<br/><br/>21 Equipment Cards<br/><br/>Set Up:<br/><br/>First step is to separate the Dungeon Cards and Equipment Cards into two decks and give them both a good shuffle. Next take the Dungeon Cards and deal out the first dungeon, laying 20 cards out face down in a 4 x 5 grid. This will be the first dungeon that the players will take turns exploring.<br/><br/>Next deal out three equipment cards at random to each player. This is your starting equipment. Players are free to look at these cards. You can place them either face up or face down on the table in front of you. Playing with them face down adds a bit of additional suspense to the game since other players won&rsquo;t know if you have the equipment needed to get past a particular encounter until you reveal it.<br/><br/>Now you&rsquo;re ready to play.<br/><br/>Taking a Turn:<br/><br/>The game is played in a series of turns. A player starts their turn with 6 action points or APs. Once its decided who goes first, players one begins their dash through the dungeon. They select and flip over any card on the 5 X 5 dungeon grid, then subtract the AP cost of that card from their remaining APs. In some cases, like flipping over the Pit Trap, the card may tell you that you must &ldquo;lose all remaining AP and end turn&rdquo; which means you&rsquo;re turn is done. Some equipment cards, like the Float-Up Potion, can be used to cancel out these cards. A card that&rsquo;s canceled in this way costs 0 AP. Some equipment cards can also be used to reduce the AP cost of certain cards, like Bandage, or even reduce them to 0, like Freeze Bomb. Your turn ends when your AP reaches 0 or you flip over a Treasure. When your turn ends you take any cards you flipped over, keeping Treasure cards separate from the other dungeon cards.<br/><br/>Then it&rsquo;s the next player&rsquo;s turn to explore. Players continue until all the cards of the first dungeon have been flipped over. When the last card is flipped, the AP of the player who flipped it is reduced to 0 and their turn ends.<br/><br/>Another 4 X 5 grid of Dungeon Cards are then laid out and the next player&rsquo;s turn begins. Play continues in this order until a total of three dungeons have been explored.<br/><br/>Winning the Game:<br/><br/>Once all three dungeons have been explored players add up the value of their treasure cards. They then count up all the other Dungeon Cards they&rsquo;ve collected and add the amount to the value of their treasure cards. Whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>"}, "219742": {"poll": [], "name": "Bushido: Genji & Eiji Takashi", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Dice Rolling", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2013", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3432420_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["GCT Studios"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3432420.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Miniatures", "Wargame"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Born to fight, there was never a doubt that these twins would take any path other than that of the samurai.

They raise The Stars and Stripes on a flagpole and send out radio signals calling for survivors to come to Dade City, Pasco County, Florida to Fort Dade for sanctuary in between very patriotic and military music being played.<br/><br/>When they get to Dade City, they find the place in ruins with dirty water flooding much of the area from the nearby swamp. There is a base here to the east near Florida State Route 301 where the expanding swamp has sunk most of the eastern part of Dade City. However, when they get close to the base, they witness robots inside wielding lasers at a distance with deadly precision against humans, zombies, mutants, and mutated creatures alike who approach the base. If any make it inside the base, the robots use giant whirling bone saws in close combat to decapitate perceived threats.

You're going somewhere, and there's something wrong, and you know these people here with you, or maybe you only think you do. All you really know for sure is that you can hear this Bell.<br/><br/>This is a science fiction suspense live roleplaying game inspired by The Fountain (Darren Aronofsky), Five-Twelfths of Heaven (Melissa Scott), Vacuum Flowers (Michael Swanwick) and the works of Cordwainer Smith.  The Bell is intended to be an emotionally intense game that pushes moral dilemmas.  (It isn&rsquo;t recommended for novice roleplayers.)  It can be run for 12 to 20 players with a play duration of two hours.<br/><br/>The premise of The Bell is that the players are the crew and passengers of a space ship called The Soul which is travelling to a planet called Castilia and experiencing technical problems.  People are normally put to sleep for the journey, with the crew waking for short periods from time to time to make repairs that the ship cannot handle by itself.  In this case, the ship is damaged with problems with critical systems.  The players wake as amnesiacs with only partial memories about who they are and why they are there.  At several points in the game they will hear a tolling bell indicating that they have to return to their sleeper pods for the next phase of the journey.  In these bell interludes they will be able to recover more memories about themselves and other people.<br/><br/>The Bell draws on a trope of science fiction which treats space travel as a spiritual journey.  It doesn't make assertions about any particular religion, but it does examine metaphysical themes and ethical issues.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>The game consists of a 194-page manual with character sheets and handouts, and an MP3 soundtrack.<br/><br/>"}, "219863": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["HTML Version", "PDF Version"], "rpgseries": ["Kapcon Scenario Design Contest"], "name": "The Devil's Brood", "rpgdesigner": ["Malcolm Harbrow"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3392509.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["The Devil's Brood"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)", "Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["History (Britain / Ireland)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3392509_t.jpg", "description": "A Plantagenet Family Drama LARP<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/><br/>Christmas 1183: King Henry of England, the most powerful king in Christendom, has summoned his family together at Chinon to celebrate Christmas.

Many adventurers are familiar with wading into combat against monsters and small groups of enemies, but this is nothing next to the glory and chaos and carnage that is true war. More than simply a change in scale, the difference between war and other combat can be profound. In a war, the characters are part of something larger than themselves, contributing to the efforts of their armies, or perhaps leading those armies themselves. The priorities of a soldier are different from those of an adventurer, and often the challenges that they face are, as well. While many characters can translate their talents as adventurers to the battlefield, one who specifically focuses on warfare and battlefield tactics will have the edge on others when it comes to true war. Each installment of Weekly Wonders: Archetypes of War provides six new war-themed archetypes for a variety of classes.<br/><br/>For this book, we focus on archetypes of the common soldier. These brave men and women comprise the bulk of every army, and it is through their hard work, courage, and determination that an army is able to accomplish anything at all. While it may not be glamorous to be one of the grunts, these tough-as-nails soldiers are nonetheless each a hero in their own right. This book includes the following archetypes:<br/><br/>    The military bloodline, for bloodragers with a long ancestry of soldiering and war, who find unnatural combat instincts and training seem to come to them suddenly in the haze of battle.<br/>    The versatile combatant, a brawler archetype that retains its incredible flexibility in combat, while focusing on fighting with more traditional arms and armor, rather than unarmed strikes.<br/>    The career soldier, a fighter archetype that replaces bravery with a series of minor benefits, allowing them to march, take cover, flank, and charge more effectively.<br/>    The battle mage, a magus archetype that specializes in the manipulation of raw arcane energy to blast foes, or create barriers to help hold the line.<br/>    The military discipline, a psychic discipline for those whose psychic abilities come from military programs to create psychic soldiers.<br/>    The warmonger, a warpriest archetype for those that worship battle above all, and trade out some of their healing powers for the ability to better make war.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Whether you're about to embark on a campaign of military exploits (such as the official Paizo adventure path dealing with invading forces), or you just want to play a more military character, this book has lots of tantalizing options to offer. Even GMs can get in on the fun, as several of the archetypes here are perfect for militarily-inclined NPCs as well, and can make for exciting and memorable encounters.<br/><br/>"}, "219907": {"rpgartist": ["Angela Deland-Baldwin", "Mark Dudley", "Scott Johnson"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Rifts Primer: How to Play Rifts and Create Adventures", "rpgdesigner": ["Carl Gleba", "Kevin Siembieda"], "rpgproducer": ["Kevin Siembieda", "Wayne Smith"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3394092.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Rifts Earth"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Horror", "Mecha", "Science Fiction (Post Apocalypse)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Palladium Books"], "rpg": ["Rifts"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3394092_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Carl Gleba and Kevin Siembieda join forces to create a tour de force of information about Game Mastering games and creating adventures.

Each turn, a player places a new Path card from a draw pile or manipulates an existing Path, then rolls a Movement Die to determine their movement, and finally accounts for their loss in body temperature. The game acts as a race against both your friends and the weather itself, as players lose temperature on each turn. If their temperature reaches zero, they're frozen solid and eliminated from the competition.<br/><br/>Players can disrupt one another's paths as a defensive move, at the potential cost of their own path development.

In this edition you are fighting for the supremacy in the western Mediterranean and Western Europe, the geographical area which the Romans and Byzantines designated as Occident. In the western Mediterranean powers, the Greeks, the Carthagians and the Romans compete for hegemony; in the north are powerful nations such as the Celts, Germans, and Dacians, who, if they are not at war to each other, aspire to the warm, sweet and rich regions of the South. The Iberians fight for their own survival. It was the time shortly after the Celtic storm on Rome, done by Brennus and after the death of Alexander the Great. It was the period of the Punic wars, followed by the beginning of the Germanic invasions of the Cimbri and Teutones, which once again placed Rome at a great danger. They were defeated only by consul Marius after his military reforms. Now you play for the supremacy in the Occident in those last pre-Christian centuries, in which the gates of the Roman Temple of Janus were only closed once. Choose your people and win!<br/><br/>While playing, you have to successfully develop several skills to win, namely those of a military strategist, a prudent economist and a skilled diplomat. Increase your empire revenue through urban development, conquests and through your navy, which dominates the trade revenue in sea zones. Use your diplomats and support your army leaders or trade with other players, instigate revolts, gain neutral provinces peacefully, manipulate the opposing army commander, or send huge sums of money to support your allies. Secure your domains by garrison troops and fortifications. Build powerful armies, recruit the best of your people to increase the performance of your army, and develop strategies to force your powerful enemies to their knees. Hope, that Fortuna favors you. May the gods be with you!<br/><br/>Reach the supremacy of your nation in the Occident. You can achieve this dominance by leading the victory-chart at the end of 8 rounds or you can eliminate one of your adversaries in a Deathmatch by conquering his last province. Several winners in different order categories are possible. If a last province of an opponent has been conquered by your army, you place one of your markers on the skulls on the game board. No matter how the game evolves, you are one of the game winners, as long as you do not lose your last province, too. Any player remains in the game until he has completely lost his last province (does not apply to the nation of BRITANNIA, they stay always in the game!)<br/><br/>"}, "219951": {"poll": [], "name": "Tyler: Model 005", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Mech / Robot"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Reversed Interactive"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Reversed Interactive"], "description": "Tyler: Model-005 is a 3D action-platformer and exploration game set in the 1950s where you control a spunky miniature robot named Tyler.

Players furiously attack each other and defend themselves in order to be the last ninja standing. Each card can be used in attack or defence and placed in the Head, Body or Legs position depending on it's tabs. There is an Active Character Token (or A.C.T.) which signifies the active player. On receiving this you draw one card and can play one card on the players sitting next to you. They then have to block this attack with a card of their own OR give you a hit token (you have 3 of these in the standard game). When you lose a hit token you recharge your hand back up to 5 cards. Lose all 3 and you are defeated.<br/><br/>There are three special indicators which can appear on the cards and these signify 'Flurry', 'Riposte' or 'Ninja Star' cards. When a Flurry card is played in an attack you immediately draw another card and can play another attack card. If another Flurry card is played then you draw and play another attack and so on...<br/><br/>When a Riposte is played in a defence you immediately draw another card and can play an attack card on the player your attacker. If a Flurry card is played then its free second attack can hit any valid player.<br/><br/>The third type of card is the Ninja Star which can attack anyone.<br/><br/>Flurry and Riposte cards chain without limit which means your games get very hectic very quickly. The more people who are playing the more fun it becomes because more players means more ACTs!<br/><br/>It is not uncommon for other players to attempt to kill steal by lobbing a ninja star across the table, or you having to change tactics when your carefully prepared Flurry chain gets blocked and you have Riposte attacks to survive.
