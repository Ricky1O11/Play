But nearly all were afflicted to at least some small degree save the pure and the simple. Was it perhaps a sign of sin? Yet, even the priests bore some mark, but as none are without sin, this still seemed possible, and over time, eyes grew darker and darker. Given just how many peasants developed Shadowed eyes suggested <br/>that it was a reflection of sin. After all, they were coarse, unrefined, filthy. They couldn&rsquo;t even read the bible on their own, and their poverty clearly proved God showed them no favor.  <br/> Then came the reports of the fires, the screams, the burning. Men were seen to burst violently into flames in their fields. Princes in their chambers, priests in their cathedrals. Most, though not all, bore at least some whisper of deep corruption and shame, and those for whom no sin could be determined, it was said, they must have carried their sins deep within their hearts and behaved most wickedly in private. Why else would the Lord see fit to have them taken by the fires of Hell? <br/> Worse still, when one would be consumed by the hellfire, others often followed. Perhaps it was the invisible demons, who once loose, wished to cause as much mayhem as possible before they returned.  <br/> It is said that those who go on pilgrimage to atone for their sins, to find those whom they have wronged and make amends are able to wash their eyes clean and turn them white once more. <br/> So serious is this plague, that lords and ladies are known to grant far more leeway to their serfs who suffer from sinner&rsquo;s eyes to leave the lands untilled. Perhaps this is because they do not wish their hellfire consumed, damned souls on their conscience should the peasantry not cleanse themselves of sin in time. Perhaps they simply do not want their crops and their mills consumed by fire. <br/> Unfortunately, as will all sin, there comes temptation, corruption, those eager to do the devil&rsquo;s work in order to hide from the devil. This came in the form of Angel&rsquo;s Milk, a sweet drink that brings feelings of peace and forgiveness, and whitens the eyes for a few hours, only for the stains to come back darker not long after.  <br/> Now the roads are littered with black-eyed travelers, called Shadow Pilgrims, each out to find those they have sinned against and do right by them. One should be warned, however, that those who seek absolution for the wrong reasons, merely to lift the Shadows that stain their eyes rather than to actually do good works, often find themselves worse for their troubles, if not consumed wholly in fire. Heaven will not be deceived. To purify one&rsquo;s eyes, one must seek to purify one&rsquo;s soul. <br/> You are such a Shadow Pilgrim, walking the lonely road, enduring the judging gazes from those who know that you are a great sinner. Living among those who would cross the streets to be away from you, who would bar their doors to you, both for the welfare of their souls and to avoid the flames should you burn soon. Beware, oh traveler, for even those who would not flee from you may abuse your trust, and put you to ill use saying that to labor for them will show God that you are contrite and humbled and will surely cleanse you. Beware such <br/>Shadow Slavers who will guilt you into servitude. There day will come for their sins to black their eyes to coals that the fires of Hell may burn them, but yours approaches much sooner and you may not have time to tarry.  <br/> Can you face the wounds within, make amends with the world, and save not only your body, but also your soul?<br/><br/>"}, "213045": {"poll": [], "name": "WarFire", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Military"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["D&K Games Studio"], "videogamegenre": ["Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["D&K Games Studio"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>WarFire is an adventure shooting game.<br/><br/>"}, "213046": {"rpgdesigner": ["Shawn McCarthy"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Printer Friendly PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Spiral Arm", "rpgartist": ["Shawn McCarthy"], "rpgproducer": ["Shawn McCarthy"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3469280.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpg": ["Spiral Arm"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpgseries": ["2016 RPG Geek 24 Hour RPGs"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3469280_t.png", "description": "declare title SPIRAL ARM&gt;<br/><br/>"}, "213047": {"poll": [], "name": "Gravity Shot", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Space"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Drunk Animations"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Drunk Animations"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Sling shot explosive nuclear warheads into collision course with your planetary assassination targets.<br/><br/>"}, "213049": {"rpgdesigner": ["Kyle Peters"], "rpg": ["I Reckon So"], "poll": [], "name": "I Reckon So", "rpgartist": ["Kyle Peters"], "rpgproducer": ["Kyle Peters"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3255339.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["Word Version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["History (American West)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpgseries": ["2016 RPG Geek 24 Hour RPGs"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3255339_t.jpg", "description": "I Reckon So is a competitive RPG for 4 or more people.<br/><br/>One of those people will be in charge of running the game and portraying any personality in the game who isn&rsquo;t one of the characters being portrayed by the rest of the players at the table.

The entire product is also super cheap (never a bad thing) and ultra accessible as it comes in a variety of formats (including 'standard', 'printer-friendly', and 'super printer-friendly'), and it also comes with printable art cards and a monster index (also available in 'standard', 'printer-friendly', and 'super printer-friendly' formats).<br/><br/>We could prattle on and on about Trouble at Grimhallow Manor but it's probably best to leave you to discover the sleepy manor-house and horrors that lurk within it for yourself.

The legends say that after the comet struck demons spewed forth from the mountain&rsquo;s zenith and plagued the land. The demons were only stopped by the Guardians, mighty wizards that ascended the mountain and sealed the gate that was opened by the meteor strike.<br/><br/>When an earthquake hits the mountain range where Vredemont resides a century later, suddenly demons appear and attack the people living at the nadir of the mountains. If they are saved by the player characters, the townsfolk beg them to climb to the summit of Vredemont and find the Guardians if they are still alive to help them reseal the demons.<br/><br/>At the top of the mountain, the group finds two extremely old men, an elderly wizard and an aged sculptor. They warn them to not approach the cave to the west as they have sealed it with the Guardian Statues to prevent things from exiting the cave but they also prevent others from entering the cave on this side.  They have felt the earthquake as well, but cannot leave these gateway undefended due to an ancient oath. The Guardians may be persuaded to help the group if they give them an oath to their cause. In that case, the sculptor helps them carve two more Guardian Statues from the crags to be placed wherever the new rift is at in the mountains to seal it as well. But while they are trying to make new Guardian Statues, suddenly they are attacked by gargoyles swooping down from the top of the cliffs!<br/><br/>"}, "213156": {"rpgdesigner": ["Steve Donohue"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Strays", "rpgartist": ["Steve Donohue"], "rpgproducer": ["Steve Donohue"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3255349.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Animal"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpg": ["Strays"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpgseries": ["2016 RPG Geek 24 Hour RPGs"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3255349_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>You and your friends are a pack of stray dogs.

In the mirrored and silvery world of Mirn, you thrive in the several nations among high society, and utilize the natural and lightning fueled technology that your world spawns, called techolony.<br/><br/>What makes this era particularly unique is the intrinsic soul bindings between the denizens of each world. As the green sun sets in Umbra, your adventure there is put on pause, and the story you had set aside in Mirn re-ignites. This soul connection is important to the game, as it allows your two character to share experiences, memories, items, and unique powers! This especially drives home the importance of unique events, characters, and interactions, as those very things are passed back and forth between your characters as they enter their dream cycle. Beyond this, your dreaming character can pass forth their dream logic to grant reality-bending powers to their waking other.<br/><br/>Play two unique characters across two fascinating worlds, or change it up, play one character who has become unbound and passes between their world and this new and foreign world, where their soul-tethered other once lived. The simple Attribute + Specialties system ensures your game begins quickly, while the unique attributes to each world help solidify the uniqueness of those same worlds.

He also receives a pawn of his color and a tent of his color.<br/>During the game, each player can find cards that help them improve their skills or increase their lives.<br/>The forest is represented by 73 tiles that are initially face down in the center of the table, we will turn them when we go exploring them, and a river that we must cross to go to the different zones of the forest.<br/>During the turn of each player can choose between three actions:<br/><br/>-Explore the jungle; He moves his pawn to an adjacent tile, and turns it face-up. Once you have seen the type of tile, you must steal a card from the corresponding deck and solve it with a dice roll, which depends on the skill you have.<br/><br/>-Recover territory explored; You can move your pawn by adjacent tiles from one to three, as long as they are scanned.<br/><br/>-Getting a camp; If your pawn has been placed in an abandoned camp tile, you can place your camp there by placing the tent of your color on this tile.

Paradox Girl combines mechanics like those you might find in Chrononauts, Carcassonne, and Reversi to create a kind of battle-of-wits on an ever-changing board, which offers lots of chess-like tactical thinking in a more social atmosphere. Paradox Girl is streamlined enough to be welcoming and accessible to new gamers and all general audiences, but thought provoking and dynamic enough to engage more experienced and calculating gamers.<br/><br/>The game is played on a 4x4 grid of cards representing possible events along a timeline/continuum. Players represent different manifestations of the same character (since the gag is that Paradox Girl frequently crosses her own timeline and interacts/fights with herself). The object of the game is to score points for yourself or to deny points to your opponents by claiming and locking down event cards on the timeline with your pawns. Unlocked events and their point values are subject to be changed every turn when players &quot;change the future&quot; (deal new cards). Control of individual spaces/cards can be contested through a very light combat mechanic called a &quot;paradox brawl.&quot; Players can also accumulate secret bonus points by snagging Waffos (tokens), Paradox Girl's favorite brand of toaster-waffles.<br/> The game is based on characters created by Cayti Bourquin and appearing in &quot;Paradox Girl&quot; by Hanako Games/Hana Comics.

In 1870, Otto von Bismarck expertly played on a millennia of tension to orchestrate the Franco-Prussian War that led to a unified German state, and the dissolution of the Second Empire of Napoleon III. This resurgent (and increasingly belligerent) Germany sent diplomatic shock-waves throughout Europe, setting the stage for the Great War, which saw pickle-helmed German troops invade the West in 1914. Resentment over the eventual Allied victory paved the way for the rise of Nazi Germany, which pointed its panzers toward Paris in 1940, delivering a crushing and humiliating defeat to France and its allies.<br/><br/>Each of these conflicts saw France invaded by Germany, and resulted in a desperate, bloody struggle. In what other ways were these conflicts similar? How were they different? Why did they turn out the way that they did?<br/><br/>Teutons!: Assaults on the West, 1870-1940 seeks to answer these questions by simulating these three conflicts utilizing a common basic ruleset and map, with modifications specific to that era and conflict. Each Unit represents an Army or Corps, and each hex represents 35 kilometers. This keeps the counter density fairly low, and the playtime reasonable. The game uses a Move-Combat sequence and odds-based CRT, and allows for some flexibility when resolving Combat. In the 1914 and 1940 games, the German Player has a special Breakthrough (exploitation) phase. These familiar mechanisms are further enhanced by clever bits of chrome, from the amorous misadventures of Mata Hari to the Miracle at Dunirk. It's an ideal introductory wargame - or rather, three ideal introductory wargames in a single box.<br/><br/>For years, designer Lou Coatney has been designing simple, fun hex-and-counter wargames which he has released for free download on his website. For some gamers - including Hollandspiele co-founder Tom Russell - Mr. Coatney's designs were the first wargames they ever got onto the table. Hollandspiele is excited to present three of these games in one affordable package, with new, attractive, super-thick counters, and a beautiful new map created by artist Patrick Tremoureux.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Hollandspiele boxed edition"], "name": "Teutons!: Assaults on the West, 1870-1940", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Press Your Luck"], "age": "0", "usersrated": "9", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "average": "8.85556"}, "213372": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Tom Russell"], "average": "9.25", "poll": [], "name": "Blood in the Fog", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Chit-Pull System", "Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "yearpublished": "2017", "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3259408_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Ilya Kudriashov"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Hollandspiele"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3259408.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Hollandspiele First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Post-Napoleonic", "Wargame"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "Description from the designer:<br/><br/>Blood in the Fog is a two-player game recreating the 1854 Battle of Inkerman, one of the most fascinating battles of the Crimean War. An Allied force made up of French, British, and Turks had laid siege to the major naval port of Sevastopol.  Desperate to lift the siege, their Russian enemies probed the allied line for a weak spot. They found it on Mount Inkerman, held by less than 7,000 British. On October 27, the Russians initiated a brief skirmish to test the British defenses (later called &quot;Little Inkerman&quot;). On November 5, they were ready to crush them with over 35,000 Russians.<br/><br/>It did not go quite as planned. The disorganized Russians had their forces divided in two parts, under the command of three generals, each of whom had a different, contradictory, battle plan. A cold and dense fog allowed the Russians to get the drop on their enemies, but visibility was so poor that there was little command structure in place for either side. Regiments and companies had no choice but to fight (or flee) on their own initiative, giving Inkerman the nickname &quot;the Soldier's Battle&quot;.<br/><br/>While the fog reduced the range of the Allied Mini&eacute; rifle, it was far more accurate and deadly than the Russian muskets, especially at point-blank range. The Russians relied on ferocious but bloody bayonet charges to make up the difference. But as Russian morale started to flag, the fog began to lift, and nearly 9,000 Allied reinforcements arrived-- particularly the fearsome French Zouaves-- the battle turned in the Allied favor. In the end, there were 4,676 Allied killed and wounded, and over 10,000 Russian.<br/><br/>The game uses a unique variant on chit-pull activation mechanisms, with each player alternating pulling from their own pool. The number of activations per turn is tied to the current Fog level. At the start of the game, it's somewhat difficult for the Fog to rise, but once it starts to do so, it happens rapidly. Russian morale is simulated via its own chit-pull pool, and like the Fog, it begins the game in solid shape but once it starts to flag, it quickly collapses. In this way, the odds start to shift to favor the Allied Player. Generally speaking, the Russian Player is strong in the early game and his opponent in the late game.<br/><br/>Step-losses and the gradual erosion of fighting strength is modeled using the &quot;stack of steps&quot; mechanic featured in some earlier Tom Russell designs, such as 2012's Blood on the Alma. The game is Regimental in scale, with each hex representing roughly one-tenth of a kilometer.<br/><br/>"}, "213373": {"rpgartist": ["Luigi Castellani", "Thomas Fayen", "Rick Hershey", "Matt Jackson"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "WWII: Operation Whitebox", "rpgdesigner": ["Peter C.

It was the first game to include the individual allocation of funding in a budget. A significant portion of the game involves special events, such as the 1988 Armenian earthquake or the Chernobyl disaster. The player's responses to these events can involve taking the historical route or a dramatically different approach; the player is given usually three to five choices after picking up the appropriate telephone.

Roberts Award-winning game Downtown. Red Storm is a standalone game that utilizes the Downtown game system to depict a hypothetical air war in May/June 1987 over the central portion of the NATO/Warsaw Pact front in central Germany.  Like Downtown and Elusive Victory before it, Red Storm is an &ldquo;operational&rdquo; level air warfare game where players manage large strike packages and numerous combat air patrols in an effort to strike enemy targets, protect their own ground troops, and secure control of the air over the land battle raging below.  Both sides have highly advanced all-weather aircraft, long-range missiles, precision bombs, sophisticated electronic warfare assets, and dense air defense networks of surface-to-air missiles and radar-guided AAA.<br/><br/>As the NATO player, you fight outnumbered in the air, but with a qualitative edge in technology and better-trained pilots.  NATO faces the daunting task of contesting the air in the face of the initial onslaught from the WP air forces while also getting bombs onto targets on the ground both on the frontline and rear echelon forces of the Soviet and East German armies.  As the Warsaw Pact player,  you must push your numerous but less flexible forces to the absolute limit in an effort to overwhelm NATO forces in the air and destroy them on the ground, all while supporting advancing ground forces.  Both players also have to manage their air defense networks consisting of overlapping layers of SAM and AAA.<br/><br/>Units<br/>Like earlier games in the series, units in Red Storm are flights of 1 to 4 aircraft, each tasked with different roles such as bombing, combat air patrol, close escort, or jamming support.  Red Storm features more than 50 types of aircraft, including both older &ldquo;3rd Generation&rdquo; workhorses like the F-4E Phantom II and MiG-23 Flogger as well as advanced &ldquo;4th Generation&rdquo; fighters including the US F-15 Eagle, the UK/West German Tornado, and the Soviet MiG-29 Fulcrum. Aircraft from the air forces of Belgium, West Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and East Germany are provided.  Ground units depict various types of troop concentrations, SAMs, and AAA assets.  The SAM network on both sides is both more numerous and more dangerous than ever, with low-altitude SAMs like the UK Rapier, US Chaparral, and Soviet SA-13 Gopher joining a daunting array of medium/high altitude SAMs like the US Patriot and Soviet SA-10.<br/><br/>Maps and Terrain<br/>Two 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map sheets depict the rough terrain in the central portion of the NATO front line, reaching from the Rhine river in the west to the Thuringia region of southwest East Germany.  The map uses the same scale of approximately 2.5 nautical miles per hex used in earlier games in the series.  This densely populated region of Europe features numerous rivers, cities, and airfields dot the map.  Unlike earlier games in the series, Red Storm features a frontline that moves steadily west as the Warsaw Pact armies advance.<br/><br/>Game System<br/>Like the earlier games in the series, Red Storm requires both players to do planning for both their air and ground forces prior to a scenario.  Raid forces must be generated, targets and routes planned, and aircraft loadouts determined.  SAM, AAA, and radar units must be placed to take advantage of the rough terrain and frequently poor weather of central Germany.<br/><br/>During a scenario, players go through a sequence of phases each turn where they conduct electronic warfare, use various means to detect and track enemy flights, and move and fight with their flights while potentially being attacked from the ground.  The heart of game is the movement phase where players use a chit-draw system that allows players to alternate moving one to five flights at a time.<br/><br/>Scenarios<br/>The war depicted in Red Storm is a short one, with just six weeks between the start of the air war and a fateful initiation of nuclear warfare by both sides.  More than 20 scenarios feature a mix of day and night operational missions for both sides, including missions to directly support frontline ground troops as well as many missions that &ldquo;go deep&rdquo; behind enemy lines to strike enemy airfields, logistics, and air defense networks.  These range in size from smaller, partial-map ones that can be played in an afternoon to very large, full-map scenarios that might take a couple of days to complete.  There are also scenarios depicting reconnaissance missions, airborne drops, helicopter assaults, special forces insertions, cruise missile strikes, and delivery of nuclear weapons.<br/><br/>Components<br/>Two 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; maps<br/>1,260 die cut counters<br/>One Rules Booklet<br/>One Scenario Booklet<br/>Four Full-Color Player Aid Cards<br/>Four Full-Color Aircraft Data Cards<br/>Two 10-sided dice<br/>NATO and Warsaw Pact log sheets<br/><br/>"}, "213498": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Mike Heim"], "poll": [], "name": "Steampunk Admirals", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Player Elimination", "Press Your Luck", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3267410_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3267410.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Wargame", "World War I"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Description from the designer:<br/><br/>Steampunk Admirals is a skirmish card game where two people duel in steampunked WWI ironclads.
