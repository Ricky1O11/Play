One hundred forty-four thousand souls felt the Rapture that was the touch of God Almighty and were assumed into Heaven.  Then came the Day of Reckoning.  Those who had marked their heads, hands and hearts with the Mark of the Beast were cast into the lake of fire.  Los Angeles, the modern Babylon, was torn from the land and swallowed by the sea.  Mankind's lordship over the beasts of the Earth has been shriven from him.  The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse were loosed upon the unrighteous.  The Great Beast was given free reign to roam the wastelands of the world and a third of the stars were torn from the heavens by the wings of Michael the Archangel.  In the end, Death claimed almost every human that lived.<br/><br/>Then things went horribly wrong.  God's hand fell upon the dust that was neither wheat nor chaff.  There were people in this brave age that had neither chosen God nor His Adversary.  The risen Christ could not damn them for their sins, nor could they enter the Kingdom.  So the Lord of Hosts hardened His heart to their cries, and left them to the clay in which they had placed their faith.  The Archangels cast down the last of the Demonspawn and withdrew forever into Heaven.  God's greatest creation, Man, was finaly left to his own devices.

It encompasses the lower half of the great desert of Haradwaith, and area labeled Far Harad on the maps of the northern world. Its watering holes and seaports teem with trade and intrigue - its wilds hold ancient mysteries and untold dangers. Though the region is little more than arid highlands, tortured canyons, and a half-score of oases, adventure and high-living await you under the southern sun of Far Harad.<br/><br/>Adventurers find Far Harad rich with challenge. In the port city of Dar, hired swords are always in demand. The vast desert looms ominously with its secretive population of Sandmen and natural hardship. Men tell of entire cities swallowed by the Dune Sea. Ghosts and demons are said to walk the shifting land, guarding treasures beyond imagination. All this and more await the brave in the Scorched Land.<br/><br/>FAR HARAD The Scorched Land includes:<br/><br/>4 FULL-COLOR MAPS covering the region and two major cities: Dir Halon and Caras Pharaz&ocirc;n<br/>A 4-PAGE CITY MAP of the great trade center of Bozisha-Dar.<br/>MAJOR LAYOUTS: detailed layouts of a key fortress, Gusar's Djebel; the oasis of Sud Sicanna, and other adventure sites.<br/>IN DEPTH INFORMATION on cultures, people, creatures, treasures, politics, and warcraft found in the deserts of Southern Middle-earth.<br/>BACKGROUND AND STATISTICAL INFORMATION for key figures like the 7-regent councilors of Bozisha-Dar, Haradan warriors, and the accursed desert minions of the Lord of the Rings.<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>Far to the South of the warring realms of Gondor and Mordor, encompassing the lower half of the great desert of Haradwaith lies an area of harsh winds and blazing sun known to its inhabitants as Bozisha-Miraz. On the maps of the Northern world the region is a labeled Far Harad. The people who dwell there have passed in and out of sight of Middle-earth's great powers, but in times of great conflict between light and dark, such remote regions have been left to fend for themselves in favor of more important lands to the north. Thus, this piece of land, while it has been swayed by outsiders, has always been given time to return to its traditional ways when greater nations grow distracted.<br/><br/>The land of Far Harad is mostly taken up by the broad deserts of Haradwaith. Its northern boundaries are lost in the desert haze some leagues south of Umbar. To the south and east stand badlands where the farthest flung fingers of Haradan civilization fall well short of touching the neighboring states. To the west swells the endless sea. At the nation's center is its only reasonably fertile area, Raj, where an inlet from the sea and a fair-sized river, the Rijesha, bring moisture to the soil. The remainder of the territory holds little more than rocky hills and a half-score eases. The sun is blazing hot in the daytime and unyielding until nightfall.<br/><br/>Where the Rijesha meets the ocean inlet stands the region's largest settlement, known to some by its Westron name of Harshport. To its people, it is called Bozisha-Dar, or &quot;Gift of the Goddess&quot; in Apysaic. Harshport is a hedge-podge of cultural styles, where that of the native population is generally dominant, but the power of Umbar and old N&uacute;menor can be seen and felt. A more traditional settlement is found across the Hills of the Moon from the Oar in the forest known as The Gaj. The town is Tresti, or &quot;Rock,&quot; named for the stone that built it. Tresti's citizens are almost all of pure Haradan descent and are a proud and powerful people.<br/><br/>Though the land has ever been only loosely involved in the great affairs of the North, the history of its people is rich and colorful, and there is plenty room for adventure and high living here under the southern sun of Far Harad.<br/><br/>NOTE: Far Harad also links with the WARLORDS of the Desert and FOREST of Tears adventure modules.<br/><br/>"}, "48121": {"rpgdesigner": ["Paul D.

This is the original version of the game, which went through several iterations before ultimately appearing as a boxed game as Railway Rivals and Dampfross. It was designed by David Watts, a Welsh geography teacher and train buff.<br/><br/>It was always intended first and foremost to be a good game to play, but David also wanted to use it for general education &ndash; explaining why railway lines were laid where they were, etc. The game is fundamentally straightforward &ndash; players build railway lines on a map (a tesselation of hexagons) with towns, rivers, hills, coastlines, etc. After a building phase there is then a racing phase &ndash; players race between randomly generated combinations of towns. Players with the most extensive efficient networks tend to win more races, and thus the game.<br/><br/>It always existed as 'just' a set of rules, with a number of official or unofficial maps available from various sources. The earliest and crudest manifestation was just a few (5 or 6) A4 hexagon sheets, and colouring instructions to make the maps up. When postal games players showed considerable enthusiasm for the game, David moved on to produce large size (slightly bigger than A2) hexagon sheets, also with colouring instructions. Later on the maps were printed in one colour on big maps, which you could colour highlight yourself, and cover with sticky-back plastic sheets, so that maps could be reused if water-based pens were used that could be washed off. Multicolour maps followed, which were later printed with a laminate covering.<br/><br/>The railways cost more if you go over mountains etc, but this gives you shorter routes. You can run parallel to other lines at a cost, or simply link into another player's track and rent the tracks of other players when you race.<br/><br/>The mechanics are very simple, and there is some luck involved with the random races that appear, and in racing. Nevertheless, the better players nearly always come out on top. Despite the apparent simplicity, there are plenty of opportunities for thoughtful play, especially with tactics such as blocking other players out of areas of the map.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Rostherne First Edition"], "average": "7.32889", "name": "Railway Rivals", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Crayon Rail System", "Dice Rolling"], "age": "11", "boardgameexpansion": ["Railway Rivals Map A: South Wales Coalfield (East)", "Railway Rivals Map AUS: Austria", "Railway Rivals Map B: London to Liverpool", "Railway Rivals Map C: Western USA", "Railway Rivals Map D: New York and Chicago", "Railway Rivals Map E: Atlantic and Lake Erie", "Railway Rivals Map F: South Scotland", "Railway Rivals Map G: Central Scotland", "Railway Rivals Map H: Western Canada", "Railway Rivals Map I: Ireland", "Railway Rivals Map IOW: Isle of Wight", "Railway Rivals Map J: Mersey & Humber", "Railway Rivals Map K: London and South Eastern", "Railway Rivals Map L: France", "Railway Rivals Map M: London and the Midlands", "Railway Rivals Map N: New England", "Railway Rivals Map O: South Wales Coalfield (West)", "Railway Rivals Map R", "Railway Rivals Map SWE: Southern Sweden", "Railway Rivals Map SZ: Switzerland"], "usersrated": "9", "boardgamefamily": ["Railway Rivals", "Tube Games"]}, "48160": {"rpgartist": ["Svetlana Chmakova", "FuFu Frauenwahl", "Matteo Lolli", "John Tuckey"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Soft Cover"], "statistics": [], "name": "Victoriana (1st Edition)", "rpgdesigner": ["Richard Nunn", "John Tuckey"], "rpgproducer": ["John Tuckey"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic520239.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "rpgsetting": ["Victoriana"], "average": "7.33333", "rpgissuearticle": ["Non D20 Product Reviews", "The Review Que"], "rpggenre": ["History (Alternative)", "History (Victorian Era)", "Steampunk"], "rpgpublisher": ["Heresy Gaming"], "rpg": ["Victoriana (1st Edition)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic520239_t.jpg", "description": "This is the core rulebook for the 1st edition of the Victoriana RPG.<br/><br/>This an alternate history game set in London, 1867.

Rampaging hobgoblins and their allies threaten to destroy the realm and all who stand before them. Characters who dare confront the horde soon discover that these particular hobgoblins worship Tiamat, the evil queen of dragons, and eventually come face-to-face with her draconic minions. The excerpts below include the introduction and adventure outline, two sample encounters, and statistics for the encounters. (Crafty DMs may find the encounters and their relevant statistics useful in other ways, too!)<br/><br/>Introduction<br/><br/>The dry hilltops danced with fire.<br/><br/>Throughout the heart of the wild badlands the humans called the Wyrmsmokes, great bonfires had been kindled atop the ridges overlooking Elsir Vale. There thousands of warriors had gathered -- hobgoblins in armor dyed scarlet, thick-thewed bugbear berserkers, goblin worg riders and skirmishers and archers, and the scaled ones as well, who often towered over the rest. For so long they had fought each other, tribe against tribe, race against race, engaged in the endless test of battle, feud, and betrayal. But tonight . . . tonight they stood together, hated enemies shoulder-to-shoulder, shouting together as brothers. And they saw that they were strong, and together they danced and sang and shook their blades at the smoke-hidden stars overhead.<br/><br/>&quot;We are the Kulkor Zhul!&quot; they shouted, and the hills shook with the thunder of their voices. &quot;We are the People of the Dragon! Uighulth na Hargai! None can stand before us!&quot;<br/><br/>One by one the tribes fell silent. Armor creaked as thousands turned to look up to the Place of Speaking. There, a single champion emerged from the assemblage and slowly climbed the ancient stone stair cut into the side of the hill. A hundred bright yellow banners stood beneath him like a phalanx of spears, each marked with a great red hand. The warpriests holding the banners chanted battle-prayers in low voices as the champion ascended.<br/><br/>On the hundredth step he stopped and turned to face the waiting warriors. He was tall and strong, one of the hobgoblin chieftains, but dull blue scales gleamed along his shoulders, and jutting horns swept back from his head. &quot;I am Azarr Kul, Son of the Dragon!&quot; he cried. &quot;Hear me, warriors of the Kulkor Zhul! Tomorrow we march to war!&quot;<br/><br/>The warriors roared their approval, stamping their feet and clashing spear to shield. Azarr Kul waited, holding his hands aloft until they quieted again. &quot;The warpriests of the Doom Hand have shown us the way! They have taught us honor, discipline, obedience -- and strength! No more will we waste our blood fighting each other. We will take the lands of the elf, the dwarf, and the human, and make them ours! Under the banner of the Red Hand of Doom we march to victory and conquest! Remember that you stood here this night, warriors of Kulkor Zhul! For a hundred generations your sons and your sons' sons will sing of the blood spilled by your swords and the glory you win in the nights to come! Now, my brothers -- to WAR!&quot;<br/><br/>The burning hills were too small to hold the shout the Kulkor Zhul gave in answer to their warlord's call.<br/><br/>War is gathering in the dry brown hills known as the Wyrmsmoke Mountains. As midsummer settles over the land, smothering everything in heat and dust, the fierce warriors of the Kulkor Zhul -- &quot;People of the Dragon&quot; in the hobgoblin tongue -- gather beneath the dreaded Red Hand banner, ready to sweep down out of the Wyrmsmokes and conquer the human lands below. Your player characters face an onslaught of fire and steel the likes of which few have ever seen.<br/><br/>Encounter Levels:Red Hand of Doom is designed for a party of four characters who begin the adventure at 5th level. Over the course of the adventure they should accumulate enough experience to reach 10th level before the climactic encounters at the end of the adventure.<br/><br/>From the back of the book<br/><br/>Who can stand against the Son of the Dragon?<br/><br/>The Wyrmsmoke Mountains shook with the thunder of ten thousand screaming hobgoblin soldiers.  From the phalanx emerged a single champion.  One by one the tribes fell silent as the warlord rose up, blue scales gleaming along his shoulders, horns swept back from his head.  A hundred bright yellow banners stood beneath him, each marked with a great red hand.  He stood upon a precipice and raised his arms.  &quot;I am Azarr Kul, Son of the Dragon!&quot; the warlord bellowed, &quot;Hear me! Tomorrow we march to war!&quot;<br/><br/>Red Hand of Doom is a Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure designed to take characters from the 6th level to the 12th level.  Confronted with the relentless advance of Azurr Kull's horde, the characters must undertake vital missions to influence the outcome of the war.  Can they shatter the armies of the enemy, or will Azarr Kul's dreams rain destruction upon the human lands?<br/><br/>Expanded by;<br/>Red Hand of Doom Creature Appendix<br/><br/>"}, "48337": {"rpgartist": ["Dana Andrews", "Roy Boholst", "Stephen A.

Real power is held by the sentinels, a group of powerful robots programmed to seek out and capture or destroy all human mutants and all beings with any hint of super poewrs.  Sharing power with the sentinels are a handful of political demagogues who keep the population whipped into a constant frenzy about the mutant menace.  Any super heroes who survive in this hostile environment do so by constantly facing the full military, political, and technological might of a new totalitarian state in the making.<br/><br/>The X-Potential is the second in a series of MARVEL SUPER HEROES game adventures set in the nightmare world of the future.  It can be played as a complete adventure in its own right, or as part of the ongoing MX series<br/><br/>"}, "48495": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "SphereWars", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "14", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic515802_t.jpg", "average": "8.14286", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic515802.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Fantasy", "Miniatures", "Wargame"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "SphereWars is a fantasy skirmish game based around player built warbands.<br/><br/>Using the I Go, You Go format-- the game requires miniatures, a ruler, and six sided dice.<br/><br/>Combat, however, is fought simultaneously.
