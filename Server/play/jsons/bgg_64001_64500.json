For seven thousand years Kiraz was the largest and richest city of Harn. The dwarves made her well, and she endured the coming of men, their haste and pestilence, their greed and wars, yntil, that is, the tyranny of Lothrim, the Foulspawner. Now gloom hangs like a shroud about Kiraz, sealed with enchantment and good stone. Her dark and cavernous, haunted halls, seem yet to ring with the muted sounds of hammers no hand has touched for six centuries. Even the woods echo with the voices of a hundred ghosts. Now and then, an adventurer grown brave from too much ale, and greedy from tales of treasure, conies to Kiraz. If he is not enslaved or slain by the Equani or gargun, he will try the Gate of Hrazadar, seek other entrances, give up in disgust, and return whence he came - if he is lucky, Ushet The hills surrounding Kiraz are home to numerous bands of ores. There is a major gargun colony at Ushet, a rave-complex just four leagues southeast of the Kiraz, Ushet is inhabited by a hybrid culture of Gargu-Khanu, and their Gargu-Arak and Gargu-Hyeka slaves. The Khanu, also known as black ores, are the largest, strongest, and most murderous of the five gargun species. The Horns of Ikarus Kiraz is also the scene of the second quest m the epic search for the mysterious, otherworld, arch-mage, Panaga. In the first quest, The Staff of Fanort, players were introduced to Panaga's misdeeds; in this quest they will come to realize that he is their nemesis.

You'll play ordinary people with powerful ambition and poor impulse control. There will be big dreams and flawed execution. It won't go well for them, to put it mildly, and in the end it will probably all go south in a glorious heap of jealousy, murder, and recrimination. It's designed to be played in a single session, usually around two and a half hours, with no prep.<br/><br/>From the Designer:<br/><br/>Fiasco is a GM-less game for 3-5 players, designed to be played in a few hours with six-sided dice and no preparation. During a game you will engineer and play out stupid, disastrous situations, usually at the intersection of greed, fear, and lust. It's like making your own Coen brothers movie, in about the same amount of time it'd take to watch one.<br/><br/>A game of Fiasco begins with The Setup -- a group activity where you and your friends create a potent and unstable set of circumstances. You choose a Playset, which fixes the game in a particular time and place -- a contemporary southern town, maybe, or the old west. Using a pile of dice, you create an interconnected circle of Relationships and Details pulled from the Playset. Once you&rsquo;ve created a situation poised on the brink of juicy disaster, you define characters based on your choices.

July 12 in Ireland has become a day of pride and anger, lawsuits and fisticuffs. Called &ldquo;The Twelfth,&rdquo; it commemorates the Battle of the Boyne, 1690, when William of Orange (hence today&rsquo;s Protestant &ldquo;Orangemen&rdquo;) and his polyglot army ended the Jacobite hopes for James II to regain the throne and allow (at least) more religious freedom for Catholic Ireland.<br/><br/>In one sense, The Boyne might be considered the last battle of the English Civil War&mdash;a conflict that had spilled into both Scotland and Ireland along the way. And it might be considered one of the last battles of the Protestant Reformation, since much support on both sides had to do with which religion other countries wished to prevail, which is evident when you find that William&rsquo;s army included Danes, Dutch, English, Huguenots, Welsh and Protestant Irish. James&rsquo; army was mostly Catholic Irish but also included a brigade of crack French infantry and some of the best cavalry in Europe.<br/><br/>The Boyne also represents a key transition point in military technology&hellip;the last of the matchlocks and pikes and first of the flintlocks, a final time when cavalry caracole competed with pressing home a charge<br/><br/>So what&rsquo;s with &lsquo;Lillibulero&rsquo;? It&rsquo;s a song that was a popular tune before this time but became locked with the whole Irish campaign. Trust us, you have heard the tune. It used to be used by the BBC, various British army groups, and the movie Barry Lyndon, and has been featured in alternative lyrics versions for several wars since&mdash;including the ACW and WW2&mdash;and in Ulster folk tunes. It was &ldquo;said to have sung James II out of three kingdoms,&rdquo; and is still part of the Orange marches mentioned above.<br/><br/>What about the game? Philip Jelley&rsquo;s design brings us area movement for the broad area of eastern Ireland relevant to the battle, with units representing the various regiments, battalions, squadrons, and batteries that fought in the battle. Each turn represents roughly one hour of time, with weather, mist, and gunsmoke affecting command and control and unit activations. Scenarios are included for the full battle with historical deployments, the full battle with free-set-up, and for specific parts of the battle (for shorter playtime). Also included is a smaller battle &ldquo;delaying action&rdquo; that some people say is what James should have done, plus, there are optional rules for units who could have been involved or who had pressing reasons to NOT be involved (Even William might not be there!). You&rsquo;ll have plenty of chances to try various ways of heading off &ldquo;The Troubles&rdquo; of three centuries ago, or of pressing William&rsquo;s claims and making a truly &ldquo;United Kingdom.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Map - One full color 22&quot; x 34&quot; mapsheet (plus a second half-sized map covering the battle of Aughrim)<br/>Counters - 176 full color 5/8&quot; die-cut pieces<br/>Rules length - 12 pages<br/>Charts and tables - 2 pages<br/>Complexity - Low<br/>Solitaire suitability - Low<br/>Playing time - Up to 3 hours<br/><br/>Design - Philip Jelley<br/>Development - Lembit Tohver<br/>Graphic Design - Mark Mahaffey<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Against the Odds edition"], "average": "7.18056", "name": "Lilliburlero: The Battle of the Boyne, July 1690", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area-Impulse"], "age": "14", "usersrated": "18", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Magazine: Against The Odds"]}, "64143": {"rpgartist": ["Petri Hiltunen", "Joona Vainio"], "statistics": [], "name": "Seikkailija (Issue 7 - 1991)", "rpgdesigner": ["Vesa J\u00e4rvinen", "Jouko Kilpel\u00e4inen", "Timo Konttinen", "Jaakko M\u00e4ntyj\u00e4rvi", "Tapani Ronni", "Tom Sj\u00f6blom", "Joona Vainio"], "rpgproducer": ["Janne Kempi", "Jouko Kilpel\u00e4inen", "Timo Konttinen", "Sami Koskinen", "Jaakko M\u00e4ntyj\u00e4rvi", "Tapani Ronni", "Tom Sj\u00f6blom", "Joona Vainio"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2278487.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Seikkailija"], "rpg": ["2300 AD", "Basic Dungeons & Dragons", "RuneQuest (3rd Edition)", "Seikkailija", "Twilight: 2000 (1st Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Finnish Game House"], "rpgissueversion": ["Issue 7"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2278487_t.jpg", "description": "Contents:<br/><br/>* Kuopan pohjalta - Reviews of 2300AD, Twilight: 2000, Battletech and Laserburn<br/>    * Short'N'Sweet - Short reviews<br/>    * Pranamurtin lohik&auml;&auml;rmeet - A short story<br/>    * Merlinin j&auml;ljill&auml; - Bards in RuneQuest<br/>    * Bardien kieli - Celtic languages<br/>    * Lyijymyrkytys - Review of Julie Guthie's Grenadier miniatures<br/>    * Kadonnut torvi - An adventure set in 1188 AD (stats for RuneQuest and Basic D&amp;D)<br/>    * Kirkko - Medieval church<br/>    * Strategiapelit - Wargaming column<br/><br/>"}, "64144": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Peter Schurzmann"], "average": "5", "statistics": [], "name": "Die Drachenburg", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2005", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Animals: Dragons"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic826887_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Peter Schurzmann"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Spiel Spass"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic826887.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "poll": [], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "One player attacks the dragon's lair with numerically superior forces to free a captured lady, the other player tries to defend the dragon.<br/>The attacker needs to get two pawns into the dragon's lair, the defender has to eliminate five attacker's pawns.<br/><br/>"}, "64145": {"rpgdesigner": ["C.

The other Spiders, called Vorpeeds, participate as needed: Venters are the rank-and-file Spiders, able to spit highly-corrosive acid at a distance; Shockers generate massive electric currents that can take you out with one hit; Bullnoses are the party-crashers, melee specialists that can also make short-ranged plasma attacks; Jammers have evolved a very advanced ranged weapon that ignores most forms of armor; The &quot;Tlisk&quot; is a failed Tlisky, unable to lead and not as tough, but faster.<br/><br/>Spiders are not under any form of Corporate control. They enter the arena looking for two things: freedom, and puppets to control.

The frontiers of that extensive monarchy were guarded by ancient renown and disciplined valour. The gentle but powerful influence of laws and manners had gradually cemented the union of the provinces. Their peaceful inhabitants enjoyed and abused the advantages of wealth and luxury. The image of a free constitution was preserved with decent reverence: the Roman senate appeared to possess the sovereign authority, and devolved on the emperors all the executive powers of government. During a happy period (A.D. 98-180) of more than fourscore years, the public administration was conducted by the virtue and abilities of Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, and the two Antonines.

One faction controls the Caesar, who can reward and punish, wage war and make peace and takes the cream of Rome&rsquo;s wealth. Every hand is raised against him and to claim victory he must survive assassinations, rebellions and the attentions of the Praetorian Guard. Foreign wars interfere with internal politics, the expansion of the empire leads to great glory and renown, but Germanic tribes and Parthian kings may invade at any time and the generals sent to repel them may march on Rome to claim the imperial purple.

When natural calamities repeatedly occurred, it was clear that the old regime had lost the Mandate of Heaven. Then the reigning monarch, facing the inevitable, should elect the wisest and most virtuous man to replace him, so as to make the change of dynasties a peaceful transformation.

King, Lords and Commons, landlords and merchants, the City and the countryside, bishops and presbyters, the Scottish army, the Welsh people, and the English Fleet, all now turned against the New Model Army. The Army beat the lot.&quot;<br/><br/>Sir Winston Churchill<br/><br/>The New Model Army was created by Parliament in 1645 to defeat the armies of King Charles I in the 1st Civil War. As Lord-General they chose Sir Thomas Fairfax, who had little interest in politics, but his second-in-command was Oliver Cromwell, already a leading member of the Independent Party in Parliament. As a military machine the New Model did all that was desired of it. They beat the Royalists at the Battles of Naseby and Langport, besieged his capital of Oxford and in 1646 Charles surrendered. Parliament needed to reach an accommodation with the King for a Settlement of the Kingdom, but he refused to yield any of his Royal Prerogatives. Secretly, he negotiated with Irish Catholics, Scottish Presbyterians and English Radicals, anyone who could return him to power.<br/><br/>By 1647 agitators elected by the Army rank and file were expressing increasingly radical politics and under Cromwell it had become a haven for religious independents. Parliament proposed to ship troublesome regiments to Ireland, disband others without payment of arrears and establish a Presbyterian Church to suppress religious dissent. In response the Army kidnapped the king and marched on London. Their opponents fled and the Army began its own fruitless negotiations with Charles, but he had other plans; he made an Engagement with the Scottish Duke of Hamilton, promising a Presbyterian Church in England if they restored him to power. In the spring of 1648 Hamilton began to recruit a 36,000 army to invade England,  the Parliamentarian armies in Munster and Wales declared for the King, the Cavalier Sir Marmaduke Langdale seized the border fortresses of Berwick-upon-Tweed and Carlisle, the Navy mutinied, there were pro-Royalist riots across England and major rebellions broke out in Kent and Essex.<br/><br/>On 30th April 1648 the Army Council met at Windsor Castle for a three day prayer meeting where they decided &quot;that it was the duty of our day, with the forces we had, to go out and fight against those potent enemies&quot;. Despite being outnumbered two, three or even four to one the New Model Army beat the Welsh at St Fagans, the Royalists at Maidstone and Colchester and the Scots at Preston. The victorious regiments occupied Edinburgh and London, purged Parliament and brought &quot;Charles Stuart, that man of blood, to an account for that blood he had shed&quot;. They tried him waging war on his people, cut off his head and proclaimed a republic.<br/><br/>Man of Blood is an area movement and impulse game for two to four players recreating the Second Civil War of 1648, the direct cause of the English Revolution and the execution of Charles I. One player controls the New Model Army, John Lambert's Northern Association, George Monck's Irish Army, Scottish Whiggamores, lukewarm militia and a mutinous fleet. The other player a loose alliance of the Royal Navy, Cavaliers, Presbyterians, Welsh, Scots, the Ulster Army and free-lance privateers. He has more men, but worse generals and variable reinforcements. They manoeuvre their regiments and warships from area to area across the map in order to destroy the enemy, capture towns, control counties and take the king.

If, at the end of the game, the player is able to pay the full amount of the loan back (i.e. by selling the Oscar to the bank), s/he wins a day.<br/><br/>10. The game is over when the first player reaches the space &quot;The Oscar.&quot;<br/><br/>The player in second place receives one &quot;Lose a day&quot; card, the player in third place receives two &quot;Lose a day&quot; cards, and the player in fourth place receives three &quot;Lose a day&quot; cards.<br/><br/>11. The Oscar is awarded to the player who spent the most money on staff/equipment. The Oscar is worth $ 10,000. If more than one player spent the most on staff/equipment, the Oscar prize money is split equally.<br/><br/>12. At the end of the game, each player counts his/her remaining money. Each player also calculates his/her &quot;Lose a day&quot;<br/><br/>(- $ 5,000) and &quot;Win a day&quot; (+ $ 5,000) cards.<br/><br/>The player with the most money left wins the game. If all players end the game without any money left, the player closest to his/her budget wins the game.<br/><br/>"}, "64234": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Josh Siegel"], "poll": [], "name": "ADDIE", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1995", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic633970_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic633970.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Trivia"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Two to four people may play at the same time.

The number of points needed would be dependent upon how much time could be allotted for the game. A quick game could be played up to 100 points. A greater point total would be set for a more in-depth game experience.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>1. Each player must roll one die. Whoever gets the highest roll selects a playing piece and places it on a Mission Card Spot. The player with the next highest roll chooses next. This continues until everyone has placed their piece. Note: Players do not get to draw a Mission Card at this time.<br/><br/>2. The player who placed their piece last gets to play first. This follows until the player who placed their piece goes last.<br/><br/>3. The players roll two dice. When the game begins the players must decide which way they will be travelling. On following turns they must continue the direction they were travelling on the previous round. The players may choose to stop moving at any time during their turn. For example, if a player rolls five on the dice, but only need three to get to a Question Spot, they may cease movement on the Spot.<br/><br/>4. The direction of movement cannot be changed until one of the following has occurred: the player lands on a Question Spot; the player lands on a Mission Card Spot; or the player has a Mission Card that allows reversal of motion.<br/><br/>5. Players must land on question spots to be asked questions. The answers will be presented in a multiple-choice format. When a question is answered correctly, the player recieves the number of points printed on the card. The person who moved previously acts as the questioner. If this happens on the first turn, the player who goes last asks the question. The questioner draws a Question Card corresponding to the map grid and the color landed on by the player. There are three levels of difficulty for answering questions.<br/><br/>Level One: Beginning learners would play for the full point total and would have the multiple choice answers read to them.<br/><br/>Level Two: Intermediate play would have the most options; the learner can answer the question for full points by not having the multiple choice answers read to them and for half points if they need to have their answer options read to them.<br/><br/>Level Three: Advanced learners would play for the full point total without having the multiple choice answers read to them.<br/><br/>6. If the player does not answer the question correctly, the remaining players may attempt to jump in and steal the question. If they answer correctly, they gain half the points that the original player would have recieved. If they answer incorrectly, they lose half of the points the original player would have recieved. All other remaining players may attempt this with the exception of the Questioner.<br/><br/>7. After successfully answering a question, the player must move to another map grid before stopping at another Question Spot. This does not apply to players who jumped in on someone else's question.<br/><br/>8. When the players land on a Mission Card spot, they get to draw one Mission card. Some Mission Cards may be saved for later and others must be played immediately. The card should state when it comes into effect.<br/><br/>9. The game concludes at a predetermined win scenario. The game can be played towards a point limit. For example, the first player with 100 points could be the winner. Alternately, the game can be played to a time limit.

Place one chip on any circle with a black circle in the middle, this is your initial infection. The player who was last sick goes first (their parasite is closer to the surface). Play will continue clockwise.<br/><br/>Play<br/>A turn consists of two phases:<br/>1) Growth<br/>Some circles have a set of numbers in them. The first number is the amount of parasite chips that grow every turn. If you have at least one chip in the circle, you will add this number of chips to the circle. If you do not have enough chips of your color, you may choose where to grow. The maximum number of chips a single player may have on the board is 50. The second number is the maximum amount of parasites this circle can support. If you begin the turn beneath the maximum, you may grow to the maximum number. If you begin the turn above the maximum, your parasites are strangled and you LOSE the amount of chips you would have gained (down to the maximum, but not below). <br/>Examples:<br/><br/>     Parasite Influidia has 3 chips on a circle with +3/15. This turn Influidia gains 3 chips to be at 6.<br/>     Parasite Betonium has 16 chips on a circle with +2/10. This turn Betonium loses 2 chips to be at 14.<br/>     Parasite Steve has 14 chips on a circle with +3/15. This turn Steve gains 1 chip up to the circle maximum of 15.<br/>     Parasite Rogainium has 11 chips on a circle with +2/10. This turn Rogainium loses 1 chip down to the circle maximum of 10.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>2) Movement<br/>Once all your parasites have grown, you may move them. Parasites may move across one black line connecting two circles. Parasites may only move one circle per turn. All parasites must move in stacks of a maximum of 5. You may split your parasites into smaller stacks at any time. The unnumbered circles may only have one stack inside at a time (so a maximum of a 5). Any parasites inside of an  unnumbered circle MUST MOVE this turn or lose one chip. Any parasite moving into a circle occupied by another player begins combat. Combat When one player's parasites moves onto another player's  parasites, they fight. Each attacking parasite kills one defending parasite by sacrificing itself. If the attacking player has more parasites, the remainder now occupy the circle. If the defending player has more parasites, any that are left remain on the circle. If both players have the same number of parasites, all are destroyed and the circle is left empty.<br/><br/>Elimination / Winning<br/>If at any time a player has no more parasites on the board, they are eliminated. The game is over when one player controls all green-colored circles.<br/><br/>"}, "64304": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Donald L.

Even so, its outcome was very important for the whole world, as it settled the overall course of Poland until 1939, including opposition both to the Third Reich, as well as USRR.<br/><br/>What started as an officers' demonstration led by First Marshall J&oacute;zef Pi\u0142sudski against the unpopular center-right government rapidly expanded into an unsuccesful coup d'&eacute;tat and ended as a short, albeit intensive quasi-revolutionary civil war. It put Poland at the brink of revolution and annihilation.<br/><br/>It is a rare example of an unsuccessful coup followed by a successful civil war.<br/><br/>&quot;Przewr&oacute;t majowy&quot; had a very special climate. At the beginning it was partly a traditional &quot;szlachta&quot; foray (polish: &quot;zajazd&quot;), partly a political demonstration, with all of the 18th century &quot;honorable war&quot; traditions (including dueling officers and shooting above opponents' heads).<br/><br/>Unfortunately in a few days it fall into an abyss of bloody total civil war, with mass use in the center of Warsaw of tanks, armored trains, heavy artillery and aerial bombardments; with general strike, assassinating, sniping, and execution of prisoners as well as masses of civilian combatants, on both sides. It was really close to use of gas warfare.<br/><br/>The game &quot;Maj 1926&quot; (name may change) depicts those days in an innovative way: a card-driven euro-wargame.<br/><br/>Occupying areas in Warsaw (like the Citadel, telephone center, Prime Minister chancellery, Ministry of Railroad, Ministry of Defense, hospitals, supply depots; also railroad, power, gas and water stations) brings advantages (bonuses to combat, movement, logistics, politics, and many more, including variable phase order).

The game is designed for easy set up with a playing time of about thirty minutes.  Information regarding the world&rsquo;s treasures will pique the interest of all playing. The game is straight forward in play with each participant trying to acquire as many treasures as they can as quickly as possible.  Wealth is accumulated by seizing treasure tokens, retaining situation cards of value, and collecting treasure notes.  For those who enjoy a quick search of facts, an informative twenty-page booklet listing historical finds of treasure has been provided.<br/><br/>Treasure Trove was created to provide an opportunity for parents and grandparents to sit down together with older children and enjoy a board game that is not too time consuming.  The game was designed to invite the interest of all ages targeting 7-12 year old.  The theme of treasure was chosen because it fascinates people of all ages.  The game has unique colorful player tokens, and the multiple treasures allow each player to collect their share in the process of playing the game.  An element of strategy is evident, but there is enough chance and luck to prevent that from dominating the game.  The beginning player has just as much chance of winning as one who has played often.<br/><br/>The game board is designed to be colorful and imaginative. Any quest for treasure entails adventure.  Illustrations of strange animals, castles, lost cities, sunken ships, and temples add to the experience of traveling the world in search of treasure.<br/><br/>There are 72 situation cards that keep the game entertaining. Historical facts, tales of wealth and hidden truths about treasure are revealed in the cards.  Some contain as much value as the treasure pieces, while others cause the loss of a turn or opportunity to move to another location on the board, adding to the element of chance.  Some of the cards are witty to keep the game light-hearted.<br/><br/>"}, "64372": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Tootsie Roll Train Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1969", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Promotional Board Games"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic635048_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Hasbro"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic635048.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Hasbro Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Trains"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This advertising travel game circa 1950's says on the Game box to &quot;Have fun being the Engineer&quot; in order to win TOOTSIE ROLLS.<br/><br/>Tootsie rolls were a brand of &quot;chewy candy&quot; manufactured in the USA since 1896.

You need 1 more seat than there are players.  Therefore, if you have 10 players, you will need  11 seats.  In this way, there will always be one empty seat during the game.  Define the target goal - usually a couch (aka the Couch of Power) with room for four people.  Starting with the Couch of Power, fill up all positions in the seating area except, of course, the empty seat.<br/><br/>Hand out slips of paper to the players.  Each player writes their name on the slip.<br/><br/>Gather the slips up, and randomly distribute them back to the players.  Make sure each player does not receive back their own name.<br/><br/>Divide the players into two teams.  The easiest method is to take the current seating arrangement and alternately assign them to a team.  One effective method is simply having every other player roll up a pants leg or sleeve to indicate which team they are on.<br/><br/>Game play:<br/><br/>The game is played a number of rounds until the Couch of Power consists entirely of players from one team.<br/><br/>Every round, the person sitting to the left of the empty seat is the caller.  They get to call out a name.  The person holding the slip of paper with that name on it moves from their current spot to the empty seat.  The player now to the left of the newly vacated empty seat is the new caller.  Play continues in this manner until the Couch of Power consists entirely of players from one team.<br/><br/>The callers may not repeat the same name twice in a row.  This helps prevent a player from ping-ponging between two spots.<br/><br/>It's important for players to remember who is holding which name.  The game is a combination of strategy, memory, and luck.  Strategy - is it better to pull an opposing team member off the couch or place one of your members on the team?  Memory - you need to remember who is holding what name.  Luck - in the beginning of the game, who is holding what name is unknown.<br/><br/>"}, "64405": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Team Identity"], "poll": [], "name": "Blik op de eeuw spel", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1998", "usersrated": "7", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic638599_t.jpg", "average": "2.85714", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Identity Games International B.V.", "PTT Post"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic638599.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Trivia"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "'Blik op de eeuw spel' is a Dutch game, published by PTT Post (Dutch postal service) at the end of the 20th centrury for promotional use.<br/><br/>The game has a lot in common with Trivial Pursuit.
