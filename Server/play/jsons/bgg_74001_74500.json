It plays across a game map that is territory-intensive in Europe and East Asia, with Africa and North America trailing along as close seconds.  The setup is abstractly accurate to the situations of the five powers (Nazi Germany, Empire of Japan, British Commonwealth, Soviet Union, and the United States) around the end of 1939 (with a few liberties taken in South America), and features neutral nations (That Japan, Germany, and Russia can attack), vassal-like allied nations (especially prevalent with Britain and Germany), capitol cities, key cities, research facilities, tanks, bombers, oil, and unique special abilities for each nation.  The objectives encourage playing across the entire map, instead of just Europe, and in fact might be more advantageous to do so.<br/><br/>Summary of National Situations:<br/><br/>1) Nazi Germany: Having taken Czechoslovakia, Austria, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, Poland, and France; and supported by its allies in Vichy France, Italy, Romania, and Hungary; the Nazi-aligned forces are poised to strike at Greece, Britain, and the Soviet Union (though the latter two are incredibly tough battles).  It has been recently brought to the attention of high command that the British-aligned forces have been building in North Africa, however, and Hitler has ordered Rommel there to advance the African front and take Libya and Egypt.  (Note: in a three-player game, one player controls both Axis powers)<br/><br/>2) Empire of Japan: Having annexed Taiwan and Korea, set up its puppet government in Manchukuo, and advanced down through Northern China, the Japanese Empire suddenly finds itself cut off from trade with the United States, a prime source of its oil.  The Japanese do have some reserve oil remaining, however, and if used sparingly, might be able to last until the Empire can secure its own sources.  There is much debate on whether Japan should declare war on America, and there is much incentive to do so, but there are some who believe that focusing on conquering China and British-dominated Southeast Asia might be a better strategy in the long run, and others still who believe the Soviet Union is an easier target. (Note: in a three-player game, one player controls both Axis powers)<br/><br/>3) The British Commonwealth: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom and its colonies have all declared war on Nazi Germany.  Commonwealth and British troops alike have poured into the battlefields of Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, as well as moved in support of British-dominated Southeast Asia and India.  The British Commonwealth also keeps a wary eye across the Pacific to the expanding Japanese Empire, hoping that their Chinese allies can hold off the insatiable Asian power long enough for the Commonwealth to get its bearings.  Sir Winston Churchill meanwhile petitions the United States to join them...<br/><br/>4) The Soviet Union: Having seen the rapid expansion and great success of Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union now seeks to expand its own borders.  The obvious choice is Finland, but Persia and Turkey to the south also seem inviting.  The success or failure of the Soviet Union rests on its ability to conquer and annex territory in much the same manner as Germany, and thus be able to display a strong showing against the remaining great powers of the world.<br/><br/>5) United States: Haunted by the spectre of the first Great War and rifled with its own domestic problems in the Great Depression, the American people want to stay out of the European War altogether, despite having become the protectors of Iceland.  President Roosevelt sees the danger of a Nazi-controlled Europe, but is having a difficult time convincing Congress of his views.  Although America could possibly get involved in the war on its own, it seems likely that the only thing that could draw the Americans is a direct attack against the United States.  However, there is a more definitive resolve to intervene if the war comes to the Americas... (Note: in a 3 or 4 player game, America is controlled by the British player, who keeps attempting to rouse the sleeping great power against Germany and Japan)<br/><br/>"}, "74025": {"videogame": ["Burnout Anthology"], "poll": [], "name": "Burnout 3: Takedown", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Xbox edition", "US Playstation 2  Greatest Hits version", "US Playstation 2 version", "US Xbox version"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic773301.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Burnout"], "videogametheme": ["Driving"], "videogamegenre": ["Racing"], "usersrated": "152", "videogamedeveloper": ["Criterion Games"], "videogamefranchise": ["Greatest Hits (Best Selling PlayStation Games, US)", "Platinum Range (Best Selling PlayStation Games, PAL)"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2", "Xbox"], "videogamehonor": ["2004 Game Critics Best Racing Game of the Year Winner", "2004 Golden Joystick Best Online Game of the Year Nominee", "2004 Golden Joystick PlayStation Game of the Year Winner", "2004 Japan Game Awards Best Unreleased Game Winner", "2004 Spike Best Driving Game of the Year Winner", "2004 Spike Game of the Year Nominee", "2004 Spike Most Addictive Game of the Year Winner", "2005 D.I.C.E.

Before play starts, players choose their vehicle based on its speed and weight. In the race modes, the player gains &quot;boost&quot; by driving in the oncoming traffic lanes, narrowly avoiding traffic, drifting around bends, getting air time, and by causing competitors' cars to crash (called a &quot;Takedown&quot;). In &quot;Race&quot; mode, the object is to win the race around the track like a standard racing game, while in the &quot;Road Rage&quot; mode, the player must takedown a set number of computer-controlled opponents.<br/><br/>In the crash mode, the player is not racing opponents on a track. Instead, in each crash attempt, the player races at high speeds towards an intersection and tries to do as much monetary damage to the vehicles there as possible, while collecting cash and multiplier bonuses. The three crash modes are very similar. In some, you drive alone, in others you crash as a team with a combined score, etc., but the goal of doing the most damage remains the same.<br/><br/>In any mode, medals are awarded for achieving certain scores. These medals are used to unlock hidden tracks and vehicles.<br/><br/>Burnout 3 features 173 different events in the offline mode, and 67 cars to unlock, including a City Bus, Truck Cab, Fire Truck, and a Trash Truck for use in the Crash mode. There was also an online mode where up to six players could compete in a race, and eight players could compete in a Crash event. In online races, there was less aggression than in single player. This service was shut down on April 15th 2010. Racers must focus on good drifts and avoiding traffic, not just takedowns, in order to win. This gave the online mode a different feel from single player. There is a racing variant known as Road Rage where players are divided into two teams. The blue team receives a three second head start and must drive a certain number of miles without being eliminated by being taken down.

The people of Eranon came to know Grynix as not only a wealthy metropolis, but also as a model for unity among the races. The city&rsquo;s founders also designed and built extensive underground structures beneath Grynix; these were  intended to hold prisoners and treasures, and to shelter innocents in times of war. Unfortunately, these &quot;dungeons&quot; reached the edge of the Dark Sprawl, not far from a Druegarn outpost of considerable size.<br/><br/>In 2274, the dark elves invaded Grynix from below, swiftly conquering a city that had been a symbol of the free races. Although the Druegarn were eventually defeated, Grynix was razed in the process. The city was lost and its dungeons all but forgotten for a time.<br/><br/>When the Druegarn took the city, many people evacuated to the relative safety of the dungeons. But, unfortunately for them, no rescue ever came, and several other reasons prevented these escapees from returning to the surface. Thus, for more than two millennia, the survivors and their descendants have lived and died beneath the ruins of Grynix, closed off from the rest of the world, in a set of complexes they know as Lower Grynix.

It is the fourth game in the Battlefield series. BF2142 is set in the 22nd century, during a new ice age which sees two military superpowers &ndash; the European Union (EU) and Pan Asian Coalition (PAC) &ndash; battle for survival.<br/><br/>The game was designed primarily for multiplayer gameplay, allowing a maximum of 64 players on a server or a maximum of 16 players in single player mode against bots on Conquest mode. It has its own ranking system to keep track of the user's stats similar to the one used in its predecessor, Battlefield 2. It also opens up new categories of vehicles and weapons not seen in Battlefield 2. Battlefield 2142 has an unlock system allowing the player to choose a new unlock every time they achieve a new rank rather than making them purchase the item. EA Games has also released a booster pack called Northern Strike, which contains new maps, unlocks, and vehicles.<br/><br/>Battlefield 2142 includes two gameplay modes, Conquest and Titan,  the latter of which can only be played online in multiplayer maps (without using mods). Both modes support varying numbers of players, up to 64, depending upon the server a player chooses to join online. The single player mode consists of a maximum of 16 players, which includes 15 AI bots.<br/><br/>Battlefield 2142 features 4 different playable kits. These kits can be selected at any time, and the player will get them when they spawn. The kits are a bit of a combination of the kits in Battlefield 2, which had seven playable kits, which were less customizable/upgradeable. Each kit has different weapons and equipment that are unique to that kit. Each kit contains a basic weapon, secondary weapon, and a knife (with the knife differing to Battlefield 2, as when a player is killed with a knife, the killer acquires the player's dog tags.) The player is able to gain rank, options, and equipment by gaining points in the game. Battlefield 2142 now has customization, allowing the player to gain more unlocks using the one kit which makes it more effective. Each class has two unlockable weapons and one passive unlock which upgrades the soldier's helmet, each helmet upgrade having different functions. The benefits of one soldier's helmet upgrade will also be shared with his or her squad mates.<br/><br/>* Assault: The Assault and Medic classes from Battlefield 2 are combined as the Assault kit in Battlefield 2142. The main weapons are assault rifles with unlockable rocket or shotgun add-ons. Other unlocks include advanced first-aid kits which can be deployed to restore the health of anyone standing close to it, smoke grenades for screening, and a defibrillator for reviving fallen comrades. The Assault kit has helmet upgrade that allows the user to determine what type of kit the enemy soldier is using, and assigns the appropriate icon above the &quot;enemy spotted&quot; marker.<br/>    * Recon: The Sniper and Special Forces classes from Battlefield 2 are combined as the Recon kit in Battlefield 2142. The main weapons are sniper rifles, while there is also an unlockable carbine for close-range encounters. This class can unlock a variety of explosives, including APMs and remote-detonated RDX charges, both of which can kill infantry upon detonation, and the latter can also be used for destroying enemy vehicles, assets and strategic objects (SAT Track, UAV, Orbital Strike and EMP Strike). Another unlockable item is the Active Camo system, which makes the user 90% invisible to other soldiers, but if the user gets too close to an enemy, the user can be easily spotted because of the electronic and static sounds the Active Camo system creates. The Recon kit's helmet upgrade increases the time the &quot;enemy spotted&quot; marker stays on the HUD.<br/>    * Engineer: The Anti-Tank and Engineer classes from Battlefield 2 are combined as the Engineer kit in Battlefield 2142. The default weapon for this class is a directable anti-vehicle rocket launcher. Other unlockable main weapons include a high-velocity anti-tank rifle lacking guidance systems and an anti-air missile launcher with guidance systems. The equipment unlocks include motion-sensitive anti-vehicle mines, a vehicle repair kit, and a defusing device for enemy explosives. While the other classes carry a pistol as their sidearm, the Engineer class has a submachine gun to compensate for its lack of an anti-infantry weapon. The Engineer's helmet upgrade works similarly to the Assault kit's, but identifies and assigns icons for vehicles instead of infantry.<br/>    * Support: The Support class from Battlefield 2 remains fairly unchanged for the Support kit in Battlefield 2142. The default weapon is a light machine gun. Unlike other weapons, this machine gun becomes more accurate the longer it is fired. Other unlockable main weapons are a heavy machine gun and a shotgun. The equipment for this class includes ammunition hubs, deployable sentry guns, a sonar device to locate enemy infantry (Northern Strike only), EMP grenades (useful in revealing nearby enemy Recon soldiers using their Active Camo), and individual deployable energy shields. The Support kit's helmet upgrade passively spots any enemy within a certain range that starts using the Active Camo. The cloaked enemy's marker will appear on both the HUD and the mini-map, and both will track as long as the enemy is within the Support's line of sight.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Battlefield_2142,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74034": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Pete Ruth"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Epic Engagements", "playingtime": "240", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic754527_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Pete Ruth"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic754527.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Epic Engagements"], "maxplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": ["Print & Play", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "240", "description": "From Manual Prologue:<br/><br/>The Story So Far...<br/><br/>Shortly after the discovery of faster&minus;than&minus;light travel, humanity reached for the stars and expanded beyond its home solar system to colonize planets throughout the Milky Way galaxy. Hundreds of planets have been inhabited, with the species seeing unprecedented growth and prosperity, all ruled autonomously and under the protection of the Free Alliance of Stars. Man had believed, after almost limitless exploration and colonization, that mankind was unique, and that no other intelligent life of any kind existed outside of human&minus;controlled planets. Then, the Continuum attacked the Sirius system. Human defense forces did not believe there to be a threat in the universe, and were woefully unprepared for the invasion, with nearly every man, woman, and child murdered by the alien menace.<br/><br/>Three weeks after the last message was received on Earth, the human fleet dispatched from Jupiter Base reached the Sirius system only to find that every colonized planet had been bombarded from orbit, utterly devastating the colonial surfaces. No sign was left of life, human or otherwise, until a small lifeboat was recovered in space with a dying scientist, Dr. Mark Wallace, who chronicled the assault on the colonies shortly before his death. Humans were not alone in the universe, and they were being systematically eradicated.<br/><br/>30 years later, the war was being waged in every corner of the galaxy, and Humanity had taken advantage of its genetic predisposition of reason and their inherent ability to quickly learn and adapt. They first learned the name of the enemy via decoding communications taken during battles, and later reverse&minus;engineered power sources, propulsion systems, and most importantly, the highly advanced weapons systems that the enemy had used against them. Humanity now had a hope of repelling the invaders, and would stop at nothing until the Continuum was stopped.<br/><br/>The Continuum is a collective of enslaved worlds, made up of several hundred species native to planets outside of our galaxy, all burning with the sole desire to subjugate all habitable planets and species, or destroy them if they were deemed a threat. The only chance that humanity has to stop them is to travel to the Continuum Homeworld, located somewhere in the Crab Nebula, and to destroy their leadership and command and control structure, defeating the threat forever.<br/><br/>Epic Engagements is a stand-alone tactical starship combat game that can use included components as well as models from Star Wars Miniatures: Starship Battles or any other models.

The premise behind the game is to create your own heroes and weave their self-authored chapters of legend and immortalized legacy in to The Book- the ultimate annals chronicling Ramlar&rsquo;s world. Will it be easy? No, otherwise anybody could do it. Not everyone is capable of slaying dragons and monstrous creatures terrorizing the countryside, banishing rapacious entities with the sole arsenal of divine faith, or channeling the mystical energy of the leylines to defend entire civilizations.<br/><br/>But you are.<br/><br/>And in your exploits, you may experience any of the wonders Ramlar wrought upon his world, from the exhilarating height of the Cliffs of Eternity to the soul-screaming depth of The Mouth, from the monumental Arbor Palace to perhaps the fabled Hethmarkn archive where The Book rests and epic tales culminate. Tales that could be your tales. Maybe you will choose to side with the Druegarn and their fellow spawn of the Dark God Gabrun. Perhaps you will oppose the honored warriors on the battlefield of the next Dakass Luot, prefacing the Song of Unmaking. Whatever your destiny, the power to cement your glory lies in your hands.<br/><br/>Your chapter in The Chronicles of Ramlar has just begun.<br/><br/>REVISED EDITION? WHAT ABOUT THE PREVIOUS ONE?<br/>Good question. Apart from being &quot;bigger, better, faster!!!&quot; this version is compatible with the first edition (save for the inclusion of &quot;Expertise&quot; which overhauled and supplanted the original skill system). All additions presented herein expand and improve upon the original game system. All you&rsquo;ll need to make are a few quick and simple conversions and you&rsquo;re good to go....We want to make it as breezy as possible for Ramlar fans to upgrade their game at nominal or no extra expense.<br/><br/>"}, "74036": {"poll": [], "name": "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Athena Sword", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Dutch Windows edition", "IT Windows Release", "US Windows Release"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic754773.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six"], "videogametheme": ["Crime"], "videogamefranchise": ["Tom Clancy"], "videogameexpansion": ["Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Red Storm Entertainment", "Ubisoft Entertainment S.A.

It was developed by Pandemic Studios and LucasArts  and released on September 20, 2004 for PlayStation 2, Xbox, Macintosh  and Microsoft Windows, the same day as the release of the Star Wars Trilogy DVD set. Aspyr released a Macintosh port in July 2005.<br/><br/>A sequel, Star Wars: Battlefront II, was released on November 1, 2005 for Microsoft Windows, Xbox, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. Unlike Star Wars: Battlefront, it was not released for Macintosh.<br/><br/>Star Wars: Battlefront encompasses battles between four main factions from both the original and prequel trilogies: the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS) of the prequel era, and the Rebel Alliance and Galactic Empire of the classic trilogy. However, factions can only play their historical adversary; there cannot be any Rebels vs. Separatists or Clones vs. Empire fights. In each faction, five different classes of characters become available. Four of the classes are similar for each faction: a basic infantry soldier (a Super battle droid for the CIS), heavy weapons soldier, pilot and sniper. Both factions have a set amount of reinforcements. When the reinforcements have been depleted, the faction loses. Scattered around the battlefields are command posts. AI units and players use these command posts to spawn from after being killed. If a faction controls all command posts, they win the battle unless capture of one of these points is disrupted. Each faction has special units such as the Droideka for the Separatists, and a Jetpack-wielding darktrooper for the Empire. Several ground and air vehicles are also available to the player on the battlefield. Ranging from the hulking AT-AT, to the fast speeder bike, there are more than 25 vehicles at the player's disposal.<br/><br/>In Star Wars: Battlefront, Jedi heroes are featured: Mace Windu battles for the Galactic Republic, Count Dooku for the Separatists, Luke Skywalker battles with the Rebel Alliance and Darth Vader the Galactic Empire. Unlike its successors, jedi characters are not playable.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Star_Wars:_Battlefront,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>", "videogameseries": ["Star Wars: Battlefront"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Pandemic Studios"], "videogamehonor": ["2004 Game Critics Best Online Multiplayer of the Year Nominee"], "videogamepublisher": ["LucasArts"], "name": "Star Wars: Battlefront (2004)", "average": "7.12403", "usersrated": "154", "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Shooter"]}, "74050": {"videogame": ["Devil May Cry HD Collection", "Devil May Cry: 5th Anniversary Collection"], "poll": [], "name": "Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogamecompilation": ["Devil May Cry HD Collection", "Devil May Cry: 5th Anniversary Collection"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic774447.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Devil May Cry"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy", "Horror"], "videogamefranchise": ["Devil May Cry", "Greatest Hits (Best Selling PlayStation Games, US)", "Platinum Range (Best Selling PlayStation Games, PAL)"], "videogamecharacter": ["Dante", "Lady", "Mundus", "Vergil"], "usersrated": "41", "videogamedeveloper": ["Capcom Co., Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Beat 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2", "Windows"], "videogameversion": ["Japan PlayStation 2 Special Edition", "Japan PS2 Original Edition", "Japan Windows Special Edition", "Nordic PlayStation 2 Original Edition", "Steam Special Edition", "UK PlayStation 2 Original Edition", "UK PlayStation 2 Special Edition", "UK Windows Special Edition", "US PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits edition", "US PS2 Original Edition", "US PS2 Special Edition", "US Windows Special Edition"], "average": "7.23415", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Capcom Co., Ltd.", "Valve Corporation"], "vgcharacterversion": ["Dante", "Lady", "Mundus", "Vergil"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic774447_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening, released in Japan as Devil May Cry 3, is an action game that was developed by Capcom Production Studio 1 and published by Capcom in 2005 for the PlayStation 2 (also ported to the PC in 2006).

The game follows Sonic the Hedgehog as he attempts to restore the world to normal after his nemesis, Doctor Eggman, splits the world into pieces, as well as his struggles with his new beast form, Sonic the Werehog. Gameplay features two distinct styles, with each being played either during daytime or night-time. Daytime stages incorporate Sonic's traditional platforming and trademark speed, with a combination of behind-the-back third-person viewpoints and 2D side-scroller platforming; gameplay seamlessly transitions between these two views. Night-time levels see Sonic transform into the Werehog; gameplay slows down to accommodate greater platform play, and involves combat against waves of enemies using the Werehog's brute strength.<br/><br/>The game's existence was first brought to light when Sega trademarked the Unleashed name, and shortly after, images and a gameplay video were leaked to the public in March 2008. Public anticipation for the game was high, owing to the video's demonstration of some two-dimensional gameplay, seen as a possible return to Sonic's platforming roots. However, critical reception for the game was mixed, with reviewers praising certain elements, such as the sense of speed in daylight stages and the graphics and audio that make up the environments, and criticizing others, such as the new Werehog game mechanic, as well as several gameplay and design concepts.

It was developed and published by LucasArts  for the Microsoft Windows and Xbox platforms. The game uses Epic Games' Unreal Engine. As of April 19, 2007, this game is backwards compatible  for the Xbox 360 with a downloadable patch.<br/><br/>The game features some gameplay elements that resemble features in other first-person shooters, including Metroid Prime, Halo, and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six. The Heads-Up Display (HUD) in the game resembles the Metroid Prime helmet display. The context-based squad  order system is similar to the Rainbow Six games. The usage of health and recharging shields, as well as the general combat gameplay, resemble styles seen in Halo 2. An unusual feature is that blood, or any fluid from a dead enemy that will splash onto the helmet, can slightly affect vision until an energy-based &quot;windshield wiper&quot; cleans it off.<br/><br/>The squadmate order system allows the player limited tactical control over the NPC squadmates. The order system resembles a simplified version of the context-based command menus seen in Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear. Many objects in the game environment will highlight when the crosshair is placed over them. The player can then press the use key to issue an order automatically associated with the object; for example, a door may highlight with a breach command, while a pile of cargo boxes may provide a &quot;Sniper cover/Anti-Armor&quot; command. The player can also order the squad to secure a certain position (where the crosshair is pointed), or search-and-destroy.<br/><br/>In single player mode, the player and squadmates do not die when they run out of health, but rather are incapacitated. If the player character is downed, the player can order the squad members to attempt to revive the player or to continue with their current orders. Therefore, the game is only truly over when the player and all members of the squad are incapacitated at once. While reviving a downed commando restores a small amount of health, bacta charging stations are necessary to fully regain it. Republic Commando maintains a first-person perspective throughout the game, presenting the story from the eyes of Delta 38.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Republic_Commando,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74070": {"poll": [], "name": "Booty", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Commodore 64/128 budget re-release", "English/European Amstrad CPC edition", "English/European ZX Spectrum edition", "English/European ZX Spectrum Silver 1.99 edition", "European Commodore 16 / Plus4 edition", "North American Commodore 64 edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic760261.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Pirates"], "usersrated": "4", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["Amstrad CPC", "Commodore 16", "Commodore 64", "Commodore Plus/4", "ZX Spectrum"], "average": "6.75", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Firebird", "Firebird Silver 1.99", "Telecomsoft"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic760261_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Players take the part of a cabin boy who has to collect numbered keys to open corresponding numbered locks while avoiding the ship's pirates.

It is developed by Digital Illusions CE and published by Electronic Arts for Microsoft Windows.<br/><br/>Secret Weapons of WWII brings many new features to the original game, such as new weapons, vehicles, battles, factions, and a new gameplay mode that focuses on fulfilling objectives more than destroying the enemy army. These new features help to bring variety to its predecessor's gameplay without overhauling the series. For example, while an Allied engineer may still maintain his original role as being able to repair vehicles, his long-ranged rifle has been replaced with a shotgun, which is effective at short distances.<br/><br/>As in Battlefield 1942, players play the role of a soldier in a two-sided battle and can choose what weapons or vehicles he or she wants to use in accomplishing this task. Usually, the team that works together more effectively wins by reducing the enemies tickets to zero. (A team loses tickets when its members are killed, but also when the other team holds a majority of the capture points on a map.) Even more so than in Battlefield 1942, the weapons in Secret Weapons of WWII are designed to be used in unison with other weapons in order to compensate for weaknesses and maximize strengths.<br/><br/>A gameplay mode introduced in Secret Weapons of WWII is an objective-based mode in which players focus on accomplishing specific objectives in order to win the battle. For example on Essen, the German forces must prevent Allied forces from destroying key portions of a weapons factory. If the Allied forces successfully fulfill these objectives, the German tickets are drastically reduced, usually winning the game for the Allies.<br/><br/>The default Allied (US) Army and Axis (German) Army have received new weapons and vehicles in addition to the creation of two entirely new factions, the SAS (British Commando) and the German Elite Troops (the SS and the Fallschirmjager). The accompanying update package 1.41 introduces an additional three new factions, USMC, RAF, and Luftwaffe. Each faction has unique weapons to their faction that can only be obtained by playing as that faction or picking them off a fallen enemy soldier. They also have unique vehicles that are only available at their bases. Even with the creation of these new factions, all the maps in the expansion pack are Axis versus Allies, as is the custom in the Battlefield series.<br/><br/>Also of special note is the Jet Pack, which allows players to fly in the air while firing a weapon. In order to maintain gameplay balance, the Jet Pack is very susceptible to blowing up while under fire, instantly killing the player. As opposed to other weapons, the Jet Pack is not unique to one faction, and instead, it can be found at one or more locations throughout a particular map as an item that replaces the player's current equipment. However, there are only four maps which have the Jet Pack in them.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Battlefield_1942:_Secret_Weapons_of_WWII,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>", "videogamedeveloper": ["EA Digital Illusions CE AB (EA DICE)"], "videogamehonor": ["2003 Spike Best First-Person Action Game of the Year Nominee", "2004 D.I.C.E.

The software distorted complex sprites so the character was required to be simple, hence the choice of an egg.<br/><br/>The game is a platform adventure where Dizzy must search the fairy tale land of Katmandu for a Leprechaun's Wig, a Cloud's Silver Lining, a Vampire Dux Feather, and a Troll Brew and deposit them in a cauldron to make a potion to defeat the evil wizard Zaks. The gameplay involves collecting items and moving to other locations where the item is required; for example, at one point a raincoat is needed to protect against damaging rain. This is made more difficult because only one item can be carried at any given time.<br/><br/>Unlike later games in the series, which focus more on the inventory-based puzzles, this game features a very large number of hazards that impede the player's progress.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Dizzy_-_The_Ultimate_Cartoon_Adventure,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74082": {"videogame": ["Quattro Adventure (1993/NES)"], "poll": [], "name": "Treasure Island Dizzy", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Commodore 64 edition", "UK Atari ST Edition", "UK/EU Amiga Edition", "UK/FR/ES/DE/IT Amstrad CPC cassette edition", "UK/FR/ES/DE/IT Amstrad CPC floppy disk edition", "US Amiga Edition", "ZX Spectrum Edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1728136.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Dizzy"], "videogametheme": ["Cartoon", "Fantasy", "Pirates", "Puzzle"], "usersrated": "5", "videogamecharacter": ["Dizzy"], "videogamedeveloper": ["The Oliver Twins"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "Amstrad CPC", "Atari ST", "Commodore 64", "ZX Spectrum"], "average": "7", "statistics": [], "videogamecompilation": ["Quattro Adventure (1993/NES)"], "videogamepublisher": ["Codemasters"], "vgcharacterversion": ["Dizzy (Treasure Island)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1728136_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Treasure Island Dizzy was the second game in the Dizzy series, and is the sequel to Dizzy - The Ultimate Cartoon Adventure.

The game is a direct sequel to Max Payne and is followed by Max Payne 3. It was released by Rockstar Games for Windows on October 15, 2003, for Xbox on November 25, 2003, and for PlayStation 2 on December 2, 2003. In Max Payne 2, the player controls Max Payne, a detective for the New York City Police Department  (NYPD) and a fugitive undercover cop framed for murder in New York City at the end of Max Payne. Two years after the events of the first game, Max has cleared his name and is now an NYPD detective. He reunites with Mona Sax, who he first met in the previous game, as they set out to resolve a conspiracy of death and betrayal, finding the mysterious Inner Circle in the center of it all.<br/><br/>Video game critics gave Max Payne 2 generally favorable reviews. Praise focused on its action and story, while criticism targeted its short length. Despite the positive reception, the game sold poorly, leading Rockstar Games' parent company Take-Two Interactive to cite Max Payne 2's sales as a cause for the company's reforecasted finances of 2004. Max Payne 2 received several industry awards, including Outstanding Art Direction at the Golden Satellite Awards 2004, and Editors' Choice Awards from GamePro, IGN, and GameSpy.<br/><br/>Max Payne 2 is a third-person shooter, in which the player assumes the role of Max Payne for most of the game, but plays as Mona Sax in several levels.  Initially, the player's only weapon is a 9mm  Pistol. As they progress, players access other weapons including handguns, shotguns, sub-machine guns, assault rifles, long-range rifles, and hand-thrown weapons. To move the game along, the player is told what the next objective is through Max's internal monologue, in which Max iterates what his next steps should be.<br/><br/>When first played, the game only offers one difficulty level that is adjusted on the fly if the game is too difficult for the player. For example, if the player's character dies too many times, the enemies' artificial intelligence is made less effective, while more health in the form of painkillers is made available. After completing the game once, other difficulty levels are unlocked. Two special game modes are also activated: New York Minute and Dead Man Walking. In New York Minute, the player is given a score based on the time taken to complete each level. The Dead Man Walking mode places Max in one of five scenarios, in which he must survive for as long as possible while fighting off endlessly respawning enemies.<br/><br/>Similar to its predecessor, Max Payne 2 allows the player to enable Bullet Time, a mode that slows down time to grant the player more time to determine what they want to do. In this mode, the screen's color changes to a sepia tone to act as a visual cue for the player. When in use, the Bullet Time meter will decrease until it is either empty or the player disables Bullet Time mode. The meter will eventually increase when not in use, but can be replenished more quickly by killing enemies. To simulate the Bullet Time effect, Max can also execute a shoot-dodge maneuver. When the maneuver is performed, Max jumps in a direction specified by the player, and although Bullet Time is activated while Max is in mid-air, this will not deplete the Bullet Time meter. The combat system has been improved for Max Payne 2; the player can now arm Max with a secondary weapon such as a grenade or Molotov cocktail, and when near an enemy, Max can hit them with his weapon as a melee attack. The game includes a rudimentary co-op system that occasionally gives Max allies to back him up when in difficult situations.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Max_Payne_2,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74105": {"poll": [], "name": "Don't Look Back", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iPhone/iPad edition", "Web Browser edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic755888.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Mythology"], "usersrated": "18", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)", "distractionware"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform", "Puzzle", "Run-and-gun"], "videogameplatform": ["iPad", "iPhone", "Web Browser"], "average": "6.42778", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "(Web published)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic755888_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Don't Look Back is a retro styled platform game playable through Adobe Flash and designed by Terry Cavanagh.

Set between Episode III and Episode IV, it focuses on the fledgling struggle between the Empire and the Rebels. It uses Petroglyph's game engine Alamo. The most recent patch was released on July 20, 2006. In October 2006, an expansion entitled Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption was released.<br/><br/>There are three game modes: storyline-based Campaign, Galactic Conquest and Skirmish. Battles can take place on a planet (land battle) or above the planet (space battle). Land battles are fought with infantry and ground vehicle units, while space battles are fought with starfighter squadrons and large spacecraft.<br/><br/>Galactic Conquest is the sandbox campaign, in which the player controls Rebel Alliance as it struggles to achieve freedom or command the Empire and strive to achieve galactic domination. A weaker, neutral faction of Pirates exists, but makes no attempt to battle the Rebels or Empire unless attacked. Each faction has at least one of three broad objectives for Galactic Conquest, which vary depending on which scenario is being played: kill the enemy leader (Mon Mothma or Emperor Palpatine), protect or destroy the Death Star, or completely remove the other faction from the campaign map. Grand strategy, production, and resource management is facilitated through a two-dimensional galactic map. The player receives funds from planets they control,and from mining facilities. Money is used to research technology, build defenses and vehicles, and train troops. Each planet confers different advantages to its owner, even though some bonuses are specific to each faction (for example, controlling Kuat reduces the price of Imperial Star Destroyers by 25 percent).<br/><br/>When enemy forces meet (either fleets in space or ground forces landing an enemy planet) a battle ensues. The player(s) can use only the equipment they brought to the battle (be it an X-wing squadron or an AT-AT). Factions must battle across both space and land maps. The defender may also use any buildings (land) or his space station (space) if he has constructed them. In each battle, each side may only have a certain number of units on the field at a time; the rest are retained as Reinforcements, which can be called in any time to designated areas when allowed. In land battles, a player can field more units at a time if he captures Reinforcement Points.<br/><br/>The storyline Campaign follows a semi-open linear path, where the given side must complete sequential mission objectives (such as stealing X-wing prototypes). Campaign missions build up to the plot of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope and eventually, the Battle of Yavin. Campaign is very similar to Galactic Conquest, although the Galactic Map is gradually opened for play as the player completes scripted events and completes missions.<br/><br/>Skirmish mode is the familiar, classic RTS mode. Skirmishes come in two types: land and space. In land skirmishes, all players start with bases and must research upgrades and capture resource nodes while fighting to destroy the enemy's base or command center. In space skirmish mode, all players have a space station that can be upgraded. The player buys land or space units to attack the enemy with until the enemy base/space station is destroyed or the enemy forces are destroyed. The player can advance in technology levels to access more powerful ships as the player gains more money. The player can build more buildings and defenses, and the space station can also be upgraded to better defend itself without requiring the player to leave ships behind to defend it. Skirmish battles require the least time investment, so it is better suited toward casual players. It also has some &quot;free-play&quot; to it. Maps can support two, three, or four players, and the difficulty is scalable as easy, medium or hard.<br/><br/>All modes are played in real time. Days on the galactic map pass continually. When a battle occurs, galactic time is paused while the battle wages. After the battle, the galactic day timer resumes. When playing against the computer, the player can accelerate time or pause time on both the galactic and skirmish maps.<br/><br/>All modes also make use of important Star Wars characters, such as Darth Vader, as Heroes. Each Hero is a single, moderately powerful unit with special abilities. For example, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Emperor Palpatine, and Darth Vader can use The Force. Some characters can be used in both land and space battles,(e.g. Darth Vader becomes a special tie fighter unit in space.) while others can be used only on land or only in space (a land-only Hero will remain on board a landing craft during space battles and have no use of their special abilities).&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Empire_at_war,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74107": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic754169.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Tom Decker"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Scott Everts", "Chris Taylor"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Victory Point Games"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic754169_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Science Fiction"], "description": "You command an intrepid starship crew, venturing onto new worlds and charting the unexplored quadrants of deep space!<br/><br/>Euro Game #3<br/><br/>Boldly go where no one has gone before in Final Frontier, where you command a vaunted starship crew of humans, aliens and robots, venturing onto new worlds and charting the unexplored quadrants of deep space to face fantastic challenges in the best storytelling traditions of episodic space operas.<br/><br/>While engaging in heroics and daring-do, relationships can form between your crew-members even as they win fame and experience, so only the best leader managing all of the skills and personalities aboard will triumph at the Final Frontier!<br/><br/>Final Frontier is a card-based adventure game for 2-4 players where players manage the crew of a starship as they perform heroic missions.

The game was developed by Mad Doc Software. It is the sequel to Star Trek: Armada. Star Trek: Armada II was released by Activision a year after they acquired the full rights to all the franchise holding of the PC Game's franchise from Viacom.[citation needed] It was the first of the three major Star Trek CP game sequel titles that were released by Activision from 2001 until their departure from the franchise in 2003.<br/><br/>Like its predecessor, Armada II is set in the Star Trek: The Next Generation universe. The game showcases events in the Alpha Quadrant between the United Federation of Planets, the Klingon Empire, the Romulan Star Empire, the Cardassian Union, Species 8472, and the Borg.<br/><br/>Star Trek: Armada II employs many of the same features of its predecessor, though with a few improvements. The crew resource can now be gathered by creating planet-based colonies in addition to Starbases, as opposed to the bonus given for placing Starbases near planets in the first game. Depending on the type of planet, establishing a colony can produce crew at a far higher rate for a much lower cost, though colonies sacrifice defense for efficiency.<br/><br/>Two new resources are also added: latinum and metal. Metal is mined from planets and balances out the dilithium costs in the first game. Latinum can be traded at trading stations for metal and dilithium, and is essential to research structures. The Klingons, Romulans, and Cardassians rely heavily on latinum, while the Federation has very little use for it. The Borg eschew latinum completely; they do not trade with other species, they assimilate them. To compensate for the lack of a trading station, the Borg have a structure which can convert metal into dilithium and vice versa. Species 8472 converts all three types of resources into an all-purpose &quot;bio-matter&quot; resource, and likewise cannot trade with other species.<br/><br/>The races available in campaign mode are The United Federation of Planets, The Klingon Empire, and The Borg Collective. In other methods of play, such as Multiplayer and Instant Action (Skirmish), the Cardassian Union, Romulan Star Empire, and Species 8472 are added as playable factions. There are also third-party mods for download that will add extra races.<br/><br/>While most races' gameplay is essentially the same, Species 8472 are different because of their biotechnology. The crew resource is not used by them; they instead use one officer per ship and have a much smaller officer limit. Since Species 8472 have no crew on board their ships, they are unable to take over enemy ships or be taken over themselves.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Star_Trek:_Armada_II,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74112": {"videogame": ["Lara Croft Tomb Raider Collection"], "poll": [], "name": "Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["IT PlayStation 2 edition", "IT Windows edition", "NA PlayStation 2 edition", "UK PlayStation 2 edition", "Windows CD-ROM (GIGABYTE Technology Bundled Edition) edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic754874.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Tomb Raider"], "videogametheme": ["Puzzle"], "videogamefranchise": ["Platinum Range (Best Selling PlayStation Games, PAL)"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Core Design"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Macintosh", "PlayStation 2", "Windows"], "usersrated": "20", "average": "5.475", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["EIDOS Interactive"], "videogamecompilation": ["Lara Croft Tomb Raider Collection"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic754874_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness is the sixth game in the Tomb Raider series, and is the sequel to Tomb Raider Chronicles and The Last Revelation. It was developed by Core Design and published by Eidos Interactive. The game was originally released in 2003 for PlayStation 2 and PC, and was the first Tomb Raider title to be released for the PlayStation 2 console. The storyline follows Lara Croft as she attempts to clear her name while she is hunted across Europe, accused of murdering her former mentor Werner Von Croy. The game has been panned universally as perhaps the worst Tomb Raider game ever made.<br/><br/>Much like the Tomb Raider games before it, The Angel of Darkness is a 3rd-person action-adventure-puzzle game that stars Lara Croft. The player controls Lara as she explores thirty-one levels, manoeuvring carefully across traps and solving puzzles to progress. Lara's new moves include a back-flip, a small hop, stealth, army-crawling, rolling out of the crouch position, hand-to-hand combat and the &quot;super-jump&quot; that can be performed whilst sprinting. Unlike other Tomb Raider games, it is sometimes necessary for Lara to acquire a strength upgrade to manage to clear certain jumps. An RPG element was added to the series, with the player choosing what Lara says in conversation, such as polite questions, bribery, or threats. Although this does not affect the main storyline, it does alter the route taken to ultimately reach Lara's goal. For example, she enters the club 'Le Serpent Rouge' differently depending who she talks to, and may be shot by Bouchard by saying the wrong thing. This, however, is mostly the case only at the start of the game (Parisian ghetto); after that, choosing what you say only affects the replies you get when entered in dialogue with another character.<br/><br/>Angel of Darkness is also the first game in the series to feature an additional playable character besides Lara Croft (later DLC for Tomb Raider: Underworld would feature another).

Both elements make use of the Prince's acrobatic capability and agility. Throughout much of the game, the player must attempt to traverse the palace by running across walls, ascending or descending chasms by jumping back and forth between walls, avoiding traps, climbing structures and jumping from platform to platform, making other types of well-timed leaps, solving puzzles, and using discovered objects to progress.<br/><br/>During combat, many of the same moves vital to the player in other situations can be put to use to overpower enemies. An example is the ability of the Prince to rebound off walls in order to strike enemies decisively. The player generally attacks enemies and blocks using a sword, although other objects/factors, such as the Dagger of Time and its time-control abilities eventually prove to be critical to victory.<br/><br/>In The Two Thrones, the Prince's acrobatic skills have improved. He is now able to launch himself off walls at 45 degree angles at strategically placed vertical shutters, slide down chutes, and balance on swinging poles, among other things. The designers have also improved the stealth system. Instead of merely being able to do more damage when striking without being seen, The Two Thrones uses a speed-kill system. If the player does not complete the speed kill, the enemy knocks him off and the speed kill fails. The amount of moves or the length of time required depends on how strong the opponents are. The same system is also used in some of the boss battles.<br/><br/>The Prince also develops a split personality, known as the Dark Prince, and this alter-ego constantly bickers with him in his mind about right and wrong. At times, the Prince physically transforms into the Dark Prince. These transformations are scripted and not controlled by the player. During these times, however, the Prince retains control of his body, and the player still has control over the character. For the most part, the Prince's dark side is simply an inner voice.<br/><br/>When controlling the Dark Prince, the player loses the ability to wield a secondary weapon, instead using the &quot;Dagger tail&quot;, a bladed whip fused to his arm. This allows medium range combat moves and new interactions with the environment. The Dark Prince also constantly loses health as a result of the semi-transformation, with eventual death from the loss. He goes back to full health whenever he collects Sand, from either a monster or object. Also, his Dagger tail gives him a different button combination for speed kills, in which he strangles his victims. Coming into contact with water will allow the Prince to return to normal.<br/><br/>&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Prince_of_Persia:_The_Two_Thrones,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74120": {"poll": [], "name": "Combat Mission: Barbarossa to Berlin", "videogamemode": ["Asynchronous Multiplayer", "Hotseat", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "usersrated": "39", "videogameversion": ["English/European Windows edition", "German Windows edition", "North American Windows (Strategy First) edition", "North American Windows edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic754887.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Combat Mission"], "videogametheme": ["Historical", "Military", "War - World War II"], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogamecharacter": ["Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger Ausf.

One where the super-spy and commando characters that languished for so long are given interesting plotlines interwoven with Cold War tensions.<br/><br/>Wargames 2 has seven superspy organizations including:<br/><br/>U.S.H.E.R. (The United States Headquarters for Emergency Response): U.S.H.E.R. is the primary American agency for superhuman affairs and also boasts a formidable brigade of power armor. After the emergence of the Iron Curtain, U.S.H.E.R. transitioned into the new mission of monitoring and opposing the Communist threat and established itself as the American security agency that would deal with threats too powerful and strange for conventional forces.<br/><br/>Shutrmovik: Shturmovik serves as the &quot;power armor&quot; branch of the Soviet military, in addition to functioning as an independent military intelligence agency. Its operatives are deployed to support Soviet military and intelligence operations, to carry out covert information gathering and sabotage missions, to assist with super-crime emergencies in the Eastern Bloc, and occasionally in support of the People's Revolution superteam.<br/><br/>P.H.A.N.T.O.M. (The Philanthropic Harmony Association for National Treaties, Order, and Militarism): P.H.A.N.T.O.M.'s founding ideal is avoiding the horrors of global war by instituting a world government with themselves firmly in control. In addition to ruling the small European nation of Ruritania, P.H.A.N.T.O.M. is a puppetmaster that controls more than a dozen countries from the shadows, with influence over several dozen more. The organization recruits from intelligence agencies, militaries, governments, and criminal organizations.<br/><br/>Foundation for World Harmony: With legions of operatives wielding high technology gadgets, the Foundation for World Harmony is an independent global security organization established and financed by the UN, with the mission of securing global political order in general, and specifically to oppose P.H.A.N.T.O.M. in its goal of world domination. It is international in both scope and make-up. The nations of the world, Eastern Bloc and Western Bloc, First World, Second, and Third World all provide resources<br/><br/>Red Directorate: Led by the enigmatic Supreme Commissar, the Red Directorate is the primary Soviet agency for the oversight of superhuman affairs. It monitors metahuman and supernatural threats to the Soviet Union. It oversees the Soviet super-soldier creation program and is charged with monitoring the Eastern Bloc population and recruiting all metahumans it discovers into government service. It functions as the supersoldier branch of the Soviet military machine, providing superhuman support to military and intelligence missions.<br/><br/>Stonehenge: This ancient organization is charged with guarding the magical artifacts of Great Britain and defending the nation and the world against super-natural threats - be they otherworldly or merely Soviet in origin.<br/><br/>Fourth Reich: The Fourth Reich was founded during the last days of the Second World War by a group of Nazi super-soldiers and cultists. From the safety of a secret Antarctic base, the Fourth Reich plots revenge against the Allies and the restoration of their empire across Europe and eventually its expansion across the world.<br/><br/>Wargames 2 includes over a dozen fully stated NPC and amazing secret base maps for several of the organizations<br/><br/>"}, "74138": {"rpgartist": ["Jacob Blackmon", "Darren Bulmer", "Darren Calvert", "Jon Gibbons", "Dan Houser", "Bradley McDevitt"], "rpg": ["Mutants & Masterminds (2nd Edition)"], "poll": [], "name": "Wargames 1: Superhuman Threats of the Cold War", "rpgdesigner": ["Mike Lafferty", "Charles Phipps"], "rpgproducer": ["Kirsten Nokes"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1861331.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)", "History"], "rpgpublisher": ["Vigilance Press"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)"], "rpgseries": ["M&M Superlink", "Wargames"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1861331_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Why a book about supers in the late Cold War?<br/><br/>Well...because. Because the Golden Age of comics birthed fistfuls of flag heroes- but hasn&rsquo;t really given them much to do since 1945. While movies such as Red Dawn, the lamentable Iron Eagle franchise, and Rocky IV (heck...Dolph Lungren&rsquo;s entire filmography) used the Cold War as an interesting backdrop for dramatic stories, comics (not always, but too often) were strangely removed from it. Rather than capitalize on such rich material, they were content to let Captain America type characters continue to confront an endless cycle of generic villains of the week or recycled WW2 threats such as the Red Skull and Baron Zemo.<br/><br/>To be clear, this is not a thought exercise about how the Cold War would have &quot;really&quot; been different if superheroes existed. Not at all. This is what I wish the 80s and 90s had been like for flag heroes in superhero comics. This is the Iron Age that never was. This was a time in comics when Captain America, Union Jack and Captain Britain were side-by-side facing down their spandex-clad Soviet opposite numbers across the Berlin Wall and engaging in a shadow war of a super-powered covert adventures.<br/><br/>Why a book about supers in the late Cold War? Because it&rsquo;s a niche that hasn&rsquo;t been done before. There are supplements that do a great job of covering the Golden Age, the Silver Age, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age of comics. But one that tackles an alternate Iron Age where the focus was on battles between the flag heroes of the NATO Alliance and Warsaw Pact? That I have not seen.<br/><br/>Why a book about supers in the late Cold War?<br/>Well...Because, when you really think about it, wouldn&rsquo;t Red Dawn have been a whole lot cooler if Captain America had been in it?<br/><br/>If you answered that question in the affirmative, then this book is for you.

Featuring Mr. Dream is a boxing video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) developed and published by Nintendo in 1987. It is a port of both the Punch-Out!! and Super Punch-Out!! arcade games (mostly the latter) with some variations. It has consistently been ranked among the best games released for the NES platform.<br/><br/>Release dates: <br/>October, 1987 (North America) <br/>November 21, 1987 (Japan) <br/>December 15, 1987 (EU)<br/><br/>Development<br/>Genyo Takeda, who produced the Punch-Out!! arcade games, directed the NES versions. Because the NES was not as powerful as the arcade hardware, Takeda and his crew realized that it would be impossible for the NES port to faithfully emulate the arcade graphics. Instead of making the playable boxer wire-framed or transparent to see an opponent, they decided to shrink the playable boxer, so that players could easily see opponents over his head. Though the arcade's playable boxer didn't have an official name, he was referred to as &quot;Little Mac&quot;, because of his small stature and the &quot;Mac&quot; part being a play on the popular McDonald's meal, the Big Mac. Other things added to the NES version that the arcade versions lacked were a rough plot, a background music track played during fights, animated cutscenes and a password system for saving progress.<br/><br/>Around the time the Gold Version was released, Nintendo of America's founder and former president Minoru Arakawa attended a boxing match featuring Mike Tyson. While watching the boxer fight, Arakawa became so astonished with the athlete's &quot;power and skill&quot;, he was reportedly inspired to use the athlete's name and likeness in the upcoming port of the Punch-Out!! series to help the game sell.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Punch-Out!! features a boxer named Little Mac working his way up the professional boxing circuits, facing a series of colorful, fictional boxers, leading to a final fight with real-life boxer, the then-World Heavyweight Champion, which is Mike Tyson in the original version and Mr. Dream in the later version. The game requires good reflexes in reaction to the computer-controlled boxers' moves, as the more advanced boxers give very little indication of their coming moves. However, Punch-Out!! can be mastered by learning the computer-controlled boxers' consistent patterns.<br/><br/>Little Mac has a limited repertoire compared to most of his opponents. His punches are limited to left and right jabs, left and right body blows, and a powerful uppercut. The uppercut can only be used once the player earns a star, which is typically accomplished by counter-punching the opponent directly before or after certain attacks are launched. The player can acquire up to three stars. To perform the powerful uppercut the player needs to simply press the start button once a star is received. For defensive techniques, Mac can dodge left or right, duck, and block attacks.<br/><br/>Little Mac also has a heart meter, which decreases by three upon being struck by an opponent and one upon blocking an attack or an opponent blocking the player's attack. When the heart meter decreases to zero, Little Mac temporarily turns pink and appears exhausted, leaving the player unable to attack, but still able to defend. At this point, Mac can regain some hearts (and his normal color palette) only by avoiding the opponent's punches.<br/><br/>A bout can end by knockout (KO), if a fighter is unable to get up within 10 seconds after being knocked down; by technical knockout (TKO), if a fighter is knocked down three times in one round; or by decision, if the bout lasts three full rounds without a clear winner. In order to win by decision, the player must accumulate a high enough point total by punching the opponent and/or knocking him down. However, some bouts cannot be won in this manner.<br/><br/>When Little Mac loses his first bout, the opponent will offer a rematch. However if he loses a Title Bout, he will be ranked down (sometimes more than one place in the rankings.) On his second loss (if the loss was a rematch), he drops one place in the rankings (unless he is already at the bottom of his circuit) and must fight his way back up. A third loss (not necessarily a consecutive one) ends the game. The exception is the final fight against Mike Tyson/Mr. Dream; a loss to them automatically results in a game over.<br/><br/>&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Punch-Out!!_(NES),&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74162": {"poll": [], "name": "Jimmy Connors Pro Tennis Tour", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Amiga edition", "North American Game Boy edition", "North American NES edition", "North American SNES edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1293448.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Sports - Tennis"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["Blue Byte Software GmbH (Blue Byte Studio GmbH)", "NMS Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "Game Boy", "NES", "SNES"], "average": "5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Ubisoft Entertainment S.A.

KI2 is the sequel to Killer Instinct (1994), an arcade game which was also ported to the SNES. Like its predecessor, the game features two 8-way joysticks with six buttons each for attacks (three punch and three kick), allowing for both a single player mode or a two player versus mode. A modified version of KI2 appeared on the Nintendo 64 as Killer Instinct Gold in 1996.<br/><br/>As with most fighting games and indeed its predecessor, two characters square off with the goal of depleting the opponent's life bar. As with the original Killer Instinct, when a player's original life bar is fully depleted, he or she will fall to the ground, and immediately begin on his or her second lifebar.<br/><br/>As with the first game, Killer Instinct 2 relies on an automatic combo subsystem in its matches. The matches, as with Killer Instinct, revolve around a three strength system (Quick, Medium, and Fierce.) However, normal moves have lost a lot of their priority and range, as well as gaining extra recovery time. Throws have been added into the game to deal with blocking characters (as opposed to the top attack in Killer Instinct.) Additionally, characters can be knocked down much easier with normal moves than in the first game, ending the possibility of opening with a 'glitch' combo and also weakening the effectiveness of normal moves. Normal special moves no longer are judged on priority, but instead follow a three tiered 'rock, paper, scissors' system, in which a certain special move will always break another certain special move (similar to the three tiered system in Soul Calibur.) The system has been seen as flawed due to little differences between the special moves themselves.<br/><br/>Additionally, a Super bar has been added to the game (similar to Street Fighter Alpha or King of Fighters). This super bar fills as players take damage. After the bar reaches a certain point, the player can use a multi-hit super special move (normally referred to as Super Move,) which is usually an extended version of a normal special move.<br/><br/>The combo system has its roots in the original Killer Instinct. By pressing a certain strength button after an opener move, a player will launch an auto-double and initiate the combo system of the game. However, unlike the first game, players can now open up combos with new and much less risky moves than before (most notable a close Fierce punch or close Fierce kick.) Additionally, Super Moves can be placed into combos, greatly increasing their damage and potency as well as being unbreakable. Additionally combos can be extended using throws, super linkers, manual-doubles, and super end specials.<br/><br/>As a result of the weakened normal moves and other changes to the system, combos have now become more devastating in Killer Instinct 2. In an apparent effort to help ease this dominance, combo breakers are now easier to perform. Unlike combo breakers in the first game, which also required a three tiered 'rock, paper, scissors' system based on strength to break, combos are now broken depending on the type of attack. Punches break kick doubles, and kicks will break punch doubles.<br/><br/>As popular as its predecessor was this next installment, in addition to praise, was reportedly criticized for its more liberal combo engine which changed the dynamics of the game considerably.<br/><br/>Parry, an advanced new addition, allows an open counter-attack after a successful parry block. A player can assume a standing defensive position and cause the attacker to temporarily freeze if the parry is successful.<br/><br/>The finishing moves have also been reworked. Now each character can only execute these attacks when the opponent's second life bar flashes red (unlike the first Killer Instinct the opponents falls when he or she loses all of his or her energy bars). Each characters has two Ultimate combo moves (one of them can be executed without executing a combo), the Humiliation sequences were dropped, and the Ultra combo feature is still intact.<br/><br/>Killer Instinct Gold <br/>Killer Instinct Gold is the Nintendo 64 version of Killer Instinct 2. It was released shortly after the launch of the console. The game suffered some graphical downgrades and the endings for each character do not change (as they would in the Arcade version) due to the memory limitations of the Nintendo 64 cartridge. Other than that, Killer Instinct Gold remains faithful to the original Killer Instinct 2.<br/><br/>These differences include:<br/><br/>Team Battles, in which one can fight with up to 11 characters. <br/>Team Elimination Battles, in which one has to finish his or her opponents off with Fatals (finishing moves similar to Mortal Kombat's Fatalities, which can be executed immediately) instead of simply depleting their life bar with normal moves, or they will simply return later on in the match (however as the computer player will sometimes use Gargos as the last opponent, victims can be removed from play anyway as he lacks a finishing move). <br/>Training and Advanced Training, in which the player can learn the moves of the character they have chosen as well as the correct execution of combos, doubles, auto-doubles link moves, etc. <br/>Options menu, which allows the player to modify certain data, such as the speed of the game, the color of the blood, button configuration, sound and manage Controller Pak data. <br/>Unlockable content, such as alternate colors for characters and scenarios, and faster degrees of speed for the game. <br/>KI Gold is compatible with the Nintendo 64's Controller Pak to save options and high scores, though the cartridge also includes battery save.<br/><br/>Unlike the arcade version, however, this home port had most of its FMV scenes and several frames of character animation removed, due to the memory limitations of the Nintendo 64 cartridge. Since this system was cartridge-based, and full-screen FMVs can take up hundreds of megabytes of space, the FMVs had to be replaced with a simple animation consisting of a zoom of the character the player was using. To compensate for the loss of animation, the stages in the game were fully rendered in 3D, as opposed to the scaling and distorting FMVs used for the stage backgrounds in the arcade version, allowing more dynamic camera takes at the beginning of the battle, while using less memory consumption. However, the quality of the animation of the sprites was notably decreased in comparison to KI2.<br/><br/>&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Killer_Instinct_2,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74166": {"videogame": ["Midway Arcade Treasures"], "poll": [], "name": "Smash T.V.", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Arcade edition", "Australian NES edition", "English/European ZX Spectrum edition", "European Amstrad CPC Cassette edition", "European Amstrad CPC Floppy Disk edition", "NES edition", "North American Genesis edition", "North American Sega Master System edition", "SNES edition", "Spanish Amstrad CPC edition", "XBLA Xbox 360 Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1562412.png", "videogametheme": ["War - Future"], "usersrated": "57", "videogamedeveloper": ["Beam Software", "Digital Eclipse Software", "Ocean Software", "Probe Entertainment", "WMS Industries, Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Amstrad CPC", "Arcade", "Commodore 64", "NES", "SEGA Genesis", "SEGA Master System", "SNES", "Xbox 360", "ZX Spectrum"], "average": "6.5407", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Acclaim Entertainment Inc.", "Erbe Software, S.A.", "Flying Edge", "Midway Games Inc.", "Ocean Software", "WMS Industries, Inc."], "videogamecompilation": ["Midway Arcade Origins", "Midway Arcade Treasures"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1562412_t.png", "description": "&quot;The play mechanic is very similar to that of Eugene Jarvis' earlier Robotron: 2084, with dual-joystick controls and series of single screen areas. The theme of the game, borrowing from The Running Man, involves players competing in a violent game show, set in the then future year of 1999. Moving from one room to the next within the studio/arena, players have to shoot down hordes of enemies as they advance from all sides, while at the same time collecting weapons, power-up items, and assorted bonus prizes until a final show down with the show's host where you are finally granted your prizes, your life, and (logically) your freedom. One of the enemies is fat and is named Mr. Shrapnel who roams aside of the walls of some rooms and after a short period of time he explodes. In the NES version, he is replaced by a giant rolling bomb.<br/><br/>The game features verbal interjections from the gameshow host such as &quot;Total Carnage! I love it!&quot;, &quot;dude!&quot; and &quot;I'd buy that for a dollar!&quot;. The former quote gives itself to the title of the 1991 follow-up, Total Carnage, which, while not a direct sequel, features similar gameplay. The quote &quot;I'd buy that for a dollar!&quot; is a reference to the catchphrase of Bixby Snyder, a fictional television comic in the popular 1987 film RoboCop.<br/><br/>The announcer in the game is voiced by sound designer Paul Heitsch. The script was created by the game's sole composer and sound designer Jon Hey. The voice of General Ahkboob in the follow up game Total Carnage is Ed Boon, coding creator of Mortal Kombat.<br/><br/>The game is somewhat famous for its extreme difficulty as well as its (for the time) high level of violence.<br/><br/>Ports<br/>Smash TV was ported to consoles, including the NES, SNES (as Super Smash TV), the Sega Game Gear, Sega Genesis/Sega Master System/Sega Mega Drive (as Super Smash TV). On some home systems such as the NES, players have the option to use the directional pad on the second controller to control the direction the character will shoot on-screen. Using this option for both players requires a multitap. The dual control aspect of the game works particularly well on the SNES, as its four main buttons, A, B, X and Y, are laid out like a D-pad, enabling the player to shoot in one direction while running in another.<br/><br/>Home computer versions were produced by Ocean for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST and Commodore Amiga, all released in early 1992. The Amiga version scored 895 out of a possible 1000 in a UK magazine review.[3] The Spectrum magazine CRASH awarded that version 97%, a rating which proved controversial as the game was very different from the arcade; the programmers believed a game more closely resembling the coin-op would be impossible on such a system.[citation needed] The Amstrad and Commodore 64 versions are similar to this and again, very different and much more basic when compared to the Williams original.<br/><br/>It is part of Arcade Party Pak which was released for the PlayStation in 1999.<br/><br/>It is part of the Midway Arcade Treasures collection, which is available for the PC, Nintendo GameCube, Xbox and PlayStation 2 and was released in 2003. These versions give the player the option to save high scores.<br/><br/>Smash TV has also been made available for download through Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade service on the Xbox 360 and is the first version of the game to officially allow two players to play the game online. It costs 400 Microsoft Points to purchase on the Xbox 360.<br/><br/>In an interview made available on Midway Arcade Treasures, Eugene Jarvis and Mark Turmell both agreed that a Smash TV 2 game had been contemplated.<br/>&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Smash_tv,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74167": {"rpgartist": ["Jason Ammons", "Kristen M.

A new faction was added to the game: the Stronghold. Moreover, an additional upgrade was added to all dwellings, which acts as the alternate upgrades of Heroes IV. The player is, however, able to choose between the two upgrades whenever a type of concerned creatures is being hired. The actual upgrade is also not permanent; a player can choose to change the creature to the other upgrade for a small fee.<br/><br/>Continuing the Hammers of Fate story, three full campaigns linking a single storyline are included. The first involves the Necropolis faction, featuring Arantir (the antagonist from Dark Messiah of Might and Magic). The second focuses on the new Stronghold faction, starring the Orcish leaders Gotai and Kujin. The final campaign is primarily focused around the Academy faction, involving the return of the Wizard Zehir from the base game, along with an alliance of other factions against the demonic Inferno armies. There is also a prologue campaign, consisting of a single mission, that introduces the Orcs. <br/>The combat interface features are redesigned to allow easier access to certain spells, including Rune Magic and Might abilities. New spells have been added with the intent of rebalancing the combat and adding more content to the gameplay. The options for in-game and combat modes have a slight redesign for new settings, such as the creature's health change indicator and life bar span.<br/><br/>The map editor is redefined to support campaign creator and feasible to support the previous versions of game maps along with expanded terrain and texture creation possibilities. Model editor for the standalone product only can also be part of the game package upon release.<br/><br/>Many items are now part of a set that provides additional bonuses when worn together. They are also carried over between missions in the campaigns provided that the hero carrying them appears again. Some of these bonuses are specific to one type of hero, others can be gained by all of them.<br/><br/>Some racial skills have been reworked, particularly Necromancy. Instead of raising only skeletons, Necromancers can now raise any Necropolis unit provided they can pay enough Dark Energy and suitable corpses are available - for instance, Bone Dragons can only be raised from slain Dragons. The dark energy is renewed every first day of the week. &quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_V:_Tribes_of_the_East,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74181": {"rpgartist": ["Jason Ammons"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Universal Monster Rules and Simple Template Cards", "rpgdesigner": ["Connie J.

It is a reflection of the character&rsquo;s beliefs and what they hold dear, and explains why they do much of what they do. It serves them as their profession or vocation in life. Sometimes a character is drawn to a specific class because of their beliefs; sometimes they mold their attitudes to fit the class they have chosen. Either way, nothing represents a character quite like their class does.<br/><br/>Just as we in the real world can choose from many different paths in our lives, so should our characters. Go beyond the standard options with Paths of Power.<br/><br/>Paths of Power details five new base classes (Anti-paladin, Gladiator, Samurai, Voyageur &amp; Witch), three prestige classes (Child of Bast, Crypt Stalker &amp; Envenomed), and four class options for player characters (Air, Earth, Fire &amp; Water Elementalist &quot;schools&quot; for Wizards).

The original Japanese version of this game is simply known as Rune. The game was released in Japan on April 25, 2002; in North America on May 27, 2002; and in Europe on August 9, 2002. Lost Kingdoms is a card-based action role-playing game where battles are fought in real-time.<br/><br/>A sequel, Lost Kingdoms II, was released a year later.<br/><br/>Story<br/>The story begins with a substance known in the game as black fog. This fog is known for consuming people, towns, and other signs of civilization or life, nothing ever to escape from within. In Lost Kingdoms, the fog invades the land of Argwyll, home of the main character Katia, who is also the princess of this kingdom. The fog has been terrorizing the land for a long time, and Katia's father - the king - eventually ventured out to help try and deal with the deadly substance. However, since her father hadn't returned in some time, Katia soon leaves to find him.<br/><br/>Before she leaves, however, she is granted access to the castle's runestone, a key item in this game. With the runestone, Katia is able to use special magic cards to battle for her against the monsters that have spawned inside the black fog. Using this runestone, Katia is granted to leave the castle in the hopes of saving the kingdom, as well as finding and possibly rescuing her father. Unfortunately for her, she later finds that monsters killed her father. Later Katia finds a new enemy in the form of another runestone wielder, a girl named Helena that she repeatedly runs into. Eventually, Katia fights and kills Helena, but before she dies Helena reveals to Katia that she was trying to save her own land from the black fog. Katia eventually discovers that a man named Thalnos is behind the black fog, as well as the existence a malevolent entity known as the God of Destruction. After fighting and killing Thalnos, it turns out that he was just a vessel for the God of Destruction. Katia then fights defeats the evil god as the final boss of the game.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Lost Kingdoms is best known for its unique system of combat. Battles are played in real-time, where the player has to keep their character moving to avoid enemy attacks and plot tactical points to attack. Katia uses her cards for battle purposes only, as she cannot fight. Lost Kingdoms also has a multiplayer system in which two players can use their own decks to battle one another. When compared to single-player, the multiplayer has various restrictions to make the fight fair. Healing and one-hit kills are forbidden. Since some cards have the ability to return used cards back to the deck, these types of cards are also prohibited.<br/><br/>Cards<br/>There are three special types of cards. Along with the battle types are elements. The elements of these cards includes fire, water, wood, earth, and neutral. Each type has its own advantage over another: Fire is strong against wood, but weak against water. Wood is strong against earth, but weak against fire. Neutral is a special and rare element, as it has no weaknesses against the other elements. Aside from finding new cards, Katia can also buy, sell, transform, and capture new cards.<br/><br/>Katia is capable of purchasing, finding, or getting her foes to submit to becoming new cards. Katia can also sell unwanted cards, and have her old cards transformed into new and/or stronger cards. Only a couple of cards are available after each level is completed, and they are not always completely new. Transforming cards is a part of the games experience point aspect, since defeating enemies with a card will earn the card experience points. Once cards earn enough experience, the shop will transform them into a different card for a certain amount of experience points. Capturing cards is a special process that allows Katia to transform her foes into cards. By initiating a capture throw, Katia can force weakened enemies into submission and transform them. If a capture throw fails, then the enemy only lose a small part of their life.<br/><br/>Card types<br/>Weapon-type<br/>A weapon-type card is a card for quick use. Upon choosing a card of this type, a monster will appear, attack, and then disappear. These cards can often be used two or more times, depending on the card.<br/><br/>Summons-type<br/>A summons-type card is a card that will temporarily replace Katia with the summoned monster. This monster will then attack. Most summons-type cards can only be used once. Once the monster's attack is complete, it will disappear and Katia will reappear.<br/><br/>Independent-type<br/>An independent-type card is a card that will act on its own after being summoned. After which, this monster will stay on the battlefield until either its hit points are depleted, or until the allotted time runs out. Most monsters are given a time limit as to how long they can be on the battlefield, but there are some exceptions. The action an independent-type monster will make varies; some will attack the enemy while others are only there for the sake of either enhancing allies or downgrading enemies, as well as decoy monsters who are used to distract enemies.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Lost_Kingdoms,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74213": {"poll": [], "name": "Lost Kingdoms II", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/UK Gamecube Edition", "Japanese Gamecube Edition", "North American Gamecube Edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3023508.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Lost Kingdoms"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "5", "videogamedeveloper": ["From Software"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["GameCube"], "average": "6.1", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Activision"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3023508_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Lost Kingdoms II, known as Rune II in Japan, is a role-playing video game for the Nintendo Gamecube developed by From Software and published by Activision in North America and Europe.

Lost Kingdoms II is a card-based action role-playing game where battles are fought in real-time.<br/><br/>Story<br/>Generations after the events of Lost Kingdoms, Katia of Argwyll is now remembered as a legendary queen. The heroine of this story is Tara Grimface, a reserved member of a guild of thieves, who is trying to find her way through a dangerous world. While she is an outcast even among her allies, they respect and fear her because she possesses a True Runestone that allows Tara to use powerful magic cards in battle.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>In Lost Kingdoms II the player engages enemies during exploration and may revisit levels after they have been completed. There are a number of new cards, though most of the original cards from the first game are retained. Many of the originals have their effects reworked in various ways. Notable changes in the card effects include giving each summon card two effects that the player may choose from, and a new type of card that transforms the player into a creature.<br/><br/>A notable interface addition is the ability to pay double the cost for any card in exchange for enhanced effect. Also, certain card combinations can be combined into a single, generally highly potent effect.<br/><br/>A new element is also introduced along with the original elements of fire, water, wood, earth and neutral. The new element, mechanical, is much like neutral as it has no weakness and strengths versus other elements. The only difference between the two is that mechanical and neutral have separate power levels, which the player can increase by using cards of the same element repeatedly, but lowering all other elements slightly and the opposite element even further. The main villain of the game is a user of the mechanical element.<br/>&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Lost_Kingdoms_II,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74215": {"poll": [], "name": "Battletoads", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Genesis edition", "Japanese Famicom edition", "NES Edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic825454.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Battletoads"], "videogametheme": ["Animals"], "usersrated": "98", "videogamedeveloper": ["Rare"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting", "Scrolling"], "videogameplatform": ["NES", "SEGA Genesis"], "average": "6.34413", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["NCS", "Nintendo Co., Ltd."], "videogamecompilation": ["Rare Replay"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic825454_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Battletoads is a video game developed by Rare Ltd. Starring three anthropomorphic toads named after skin conditions (Rash, Zitz and Pimple), the game was created to rival the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games.<br/><br/>The first game was developed by Rare for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991. It was subsequently ported by Mindscape to the Amiga in 1992, by Sega to the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis and Sega Game Gear both in 1993, by Rare to the Game Boy in 1993 retitled as Battletoads in Ragnarok's World, and by Mindscape to the Amiga CD32 in 1994. Ports for IBM PC and Atari ST were planned by Mindscape but never released. A fully developed Sega Master System version was also reportedly kept unreleased by Sega.<br/><br/>It is arguably one of the most graphically advanced video games ever released for the NES, at a time when the video game market was turning to the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The game became famous for its extreme difficulty and humorous ways of beating enemies, as during finishing attacks, the character's body parts transform into gigantic, exaggerated appendages for devastating attacks and comic effect.<br/><br/>Story<br/>See also: List of characters in the Battletoads series<br/>After her defeat by the Galactic Corporation at the battle of Canis Major, the evil Dark Queen and her renegade space troops retreat to the outer reaches of the universe, hiding out in dark spaces between the stars. Meanwhile, on board the spaceship Vulture, Professor T. Bird and the trio of Battletoads - Rash, Zitz and Pimple - are escorting the Princess Angelica back to her home planet, where her father, the Terran Emperor, awaits her safe arrival. Along the way, Pimple, the biggest Battletoad, takes Angelica out for a cruise in the Toadster to a nearby Leisure Station, but the Dark Queen ambushes them before they can get there, and they are kidnapped and carried away to Ragnarok's World, the Dark Queen's planet. Professor Bird sends remaining Battletoads down on Ragnarok to save Pimple and Angelica, but it will be a hard battle against planet's dangerous environments, traps and Dark Queen's troops. They have to go a long way from planet's rough surface to deep caves and landed Gargantua and ultimately to the Tower of Shadows, where the Dark Queen awaits.<br/><br/>The comic with the backstory of Battletoads, written by Rare employee Guy Miller, was also published in a Nintendo Power.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Different levels of the game have very different play styles. There are a few 3D and traditional 2D &quot;beat-em-up&quot; levels in which the player progresses by defeating enemies, though even these levels tend to have many lethal obstacles. The most difficult levels are the obstacle course and race levels, where the character must dodge a series of obstacles while driving or flying at high speed, or outrun an enemy that can instantly kill the player. These levels typically required the player to memorize the sequence of obstacles in the way, and to have extremely rapid reflexes. Other levels include a climbing/jumping &quot;snake maze&quot;, an underwater level with lethal spikes and dangerous monsters, and two difficult &quot;tower climb&quot; levels, including the final climb of the Dark Queen's tower.<br/><br/>Part of the series' marketable appeal is due to its exaggerated ways of finishing off enemies. These include a headbutt that has the Battletoad sprout ram horns (or, in Pimple's case, a football helmet in the arcade game), a punch with an extremely enlarged fist, a two-handed smash into the ground that yielded only the enemy's head sticking out, a kick move with the character sprouting a very enlarged boot, and on climbing/falling levels, the ability to transform into a wrecking ball by having your character line up with the wall on either side of the screen.<br/><br/>&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Battletoads,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74216": {"poll": [], "name": "Godzilla Generations: Maximum Impact", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Dreamcast edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "videogamecharacter": ["Godzilla"], "videogamedeveloper": ["GE (General Entertainment)"], "videogamefranchise": ["Godzilla"], "videogameplatform": ["Sega Dreamcast"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SEGA Corporation"], "vgcharacterversion": ["Godzilla (Maximum Impact)"], "description": "[User summary]<br/><br/>On rails shooter in which you play Godzilla as he battles his way through various city scapes fighting off the EDF in order to confront a selection of bosses from the movies such as, Biollante, Space Godzilla and Destoroyah.<br/><br/>"}, "74217": {"poll": [], "name": "Battletoads in Battlemaniacs", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Sega Master System Edition", "SNES Edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic766698.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Battletoads"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "12", "videogamedeveloper": ["Rare"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting", "Scrolling"], "videogameplatform": ["SEGA Master System", "SNES"], "average": "6.16667", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Nintendo Co., Ltd.", "Virgin Games"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic766698_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Battletoads in Battlemaniacs is a game released by Tradewest in 1993 for the Super NES.

It was originally released for the NES and later ported to the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, Super NES, and Game Boy.<br/><br/>Overview<br/>The Ultimate Team is a crossover of both Technos Japan's Double Dragon and Rare's own Battletoads game franchises, although Technos had little or no credited involvement in the production of the game outside of the Double Dragon license. The game features the characters from the Double Dragon series, Billy and Jimmy Lee, two young martial arts experts. Also included are the three humanoid toad protagonists from the Battletoads game. Some of the enemies are from the Battletoads and Double Dragon games, while others are original. The game's engine and design are directly based upon the Battletoads series.<br/><br/>Plot<br/>After being defeated by the Battletoads, the humiliated Dark Queen flees to the outer reaches of the universe. The 'Toads and their mentor get on with their lives. However, one day the Earth's military is neutralized and a giant spaceship called Colossus emerges from the moon. Apparently, the Dark Queen is back in another plan to dominate the galaxy, and she has allied herself with the Shadow Warriors (from the Double Dragon series) to supplement her forces.<br/><br/>Deciding to even the odds, the Battletoads get in contact with Billy and Jimmy Lee and asks them for their help. The brothers agree, and all five immediately take off for the Colossus in a mission to stop this two-pronged threat.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>The player has a choice of five playable characters: Billy and Jimmy Lee (from Double Dragon), and Zitz, Pimple and Rash from Battletoads. The player must then proceed through seven stages, kicking and punching each enemy that comes onscreen. A boss is included at the end of each stage, challenging the player before they can progress to a higher level of the game.<br/><br/>With two players, the continues are overlapping. Whenever one player continues, then both players have to start at the beginning of the level. This is the opposite of games like Contra, where a strong player can tow a weak player along to advanced levels. In Battletoads &amp; Double Dragon, a weak player will hold a strong player back.<br/>&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Battle_Toads_&amp;_Double_Dragon,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74222": {"videogame": ["Space Channel 5: Special Edition"], "poll": [], "name": "Space Channel 5", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Australian PlayStation 2 edition", "Japanese Dreamcast edition", "North American Dreamcast edition", "North American Gameboy Advance edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic786921.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Space Channel 5"], "videogametheme": ["Music", "Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "24", "videogamedeveloper": ["AM9", "SEGA Corporation", "THQ", "United Game Artists"], "videogamegenre": ["Rhythm"], "videogameplatform": ["Game Boy Advance", "PlayStation 2", "Sega Dreamcast"], "videogamehonor": ["2000 Game Critics Best Social/Casual/Puzzle Game of the Year Nominee", "2001 D.I.C.E.

Extraction Point is an expansion pack for the horror themed first-person shooter computer and video game F.E.A.R., published by Vivendi Universal and developed by TimeGate Studios, rather than Monolith Productions, the developers of F.E.A.R.. It was released on October 24, 2006 for Windows and requires the full original game in order to be played. Also, a stand-alone single player demo has been previously released.<br/><br/>This expansion owes its name to the game's ultimate goal for the player, to reach the extraction point and leave the city where the adventure takes place. Extraction Point adds new weapons, enemies, and single-player levels, but no new multiplayer content. Additional improvements were also made to the enemy artificial intelligence.The sequel to F.E.A.R., F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin, ignores the events of both expansion packs.<br/><br/>Gameplay remains essentially the same as in the original F.E.A.R., though Extraction Point touts some new additions, including 3 new weapons (a minigun, a laser weapon, and a deployable turret), a few new enemies, as well as new locales (though frequently similar to the original game's environments, a common complaint of reviewers).Firefights are still cinematic and usually on a grander scale than in F.E.A.R.  - there are frequently a larger number of enemies to deal with and lengthier battles. Another new feature of Extraction Point is the ability to bash open doors by using the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e function, as well as blast them open with explosives. The 'hallucination' sequences are notably more gratuitous and frequent than they were in the first game. In addition, certain supply crates bearing the ATC logo can be bashed open, revealing weapons or health packs.<br/><br/>Extraction Point also has higher system requirements than the original F.E.A.R., and users may notice signs of system overload (such as graphical slowdown) if they run Extraction Point using the same performance settings as the original game.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;F.E.A.R._Extraction_Point,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74227": {"poll": [], "name": "Cossacks II: Napoleonic Wars", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Windows edition", "North American Windows edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic755763.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Cossacks"], "videogametheme": ["Historical"], "usersrated": "12", "videogameexpansion": ["Cossacks II: Battle for Europe"], "videogamedeveloper": ["GSC Game World"], "videogamegenre": ["Real Time Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "6.41667", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["cdv Software Entertainment"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic755763_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Cossacks II: Napoleonic Wars is the fourth computer game in the Cossacks series of real-time strategy games, released in Spring 2005 to mixed reviews.

Therefore, fewer technologies can be researched than in other Cossacks games, and there aren't as many different unit types for each country as before. On the other hand, Cossacks II allows a large number of units to be trained and it has many tactical options and an updated graphical engine.<br/><br/>The Cossacks series has always been noted for having a large number of units on screen simultaneously, and that all are controllable at the same time; this game is no exception.

It started as The Dreamland Chronicles: Freedom Ridge being produced by the Mythos Games, original developers of the X-COM series, until 2002 when it was bought by ALTAR and restarted.<br/><br/>In concept, the game is similar to unreleased X-COM: Genesis. Player assumes the role of the Earth's last hope - the commander of the last, scattered humans left on the planet. It is up to him to guide your forces through the planet's time of crisis, and overcome the alien threat. UFO: Aftermath combines global strategy with tactical missions, weaving them together with a storyline and a strategic, RPG-like approach to each soldiers attributes and skills.<br/><br/>With its roots deeply in the X-Com series, the game combines elements of strategy with squad-based tactics. The game therefore consists of two separate parts which are played alternately: A strategy phase in which the player controls and expands his organization, and a tactical phase in which player-controlled units do battle with alien enemies.<br/><br/>The strategic phase allows the player to outfit his/her troopers for action, acquire new equipment and personnel, and conduct research to enable the production of more advanced equipment. Mission markers pop up on the globe indicating locations where a team can be dispatched to do battle. Winning or losing a battle may have the effect of expanding the player's territory, allowing more access to resources which enable further expansion. This is much in line with X-Com strategic mechanics.<br/><br/>The tactical game can be described as pause-based real-time combat. All combatants on the tactical battle area move and act simultaneously, rather than using turns. The player can pause time (or tell the game to automatically pause on certain events), and issue orders to his/her troopers, which will only be carried out once time is unpaused. Also in deviation from the X-Com series, the battlefield is presented in fully rotatable 3D, and as such dispenses with the technical limitations of isometric view.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;UFO_Aftermath,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74231": {"rpgdesigner": ["Darrel Miller"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF"], "statistics": [], "name": "Supers!

Otherwise, they may rejoin the sheep to the flock face-down wherever they please.<br/><br/>As soon as any player thinks they know where four sheep of the same colour are in a 2x2 group, they yell &quot;Happy Sheep&quot; and turn over the four tiles. If they're right, they win; if not, they're out and play continues.<br/><br/>It sounds simple, but with other players moving tiles, bluffing and sabotaging, it's easy to get beaten to the win or tricked into calling incorrectly.<br/><br/>For strategic players, the backs of the tiles come in with and without daisies, so by some careful calculation it is possible to improve your decisions...<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English First edition"], "age": "6", "name": "Happy Sheep", "playingtime": "5", "boardgamemechanic": ["Memory", "Tile Placement"], "average": "4.25", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Sheep"]}, "74244": {"rpgartist": ["Paul Daly", "Darkroom Productions, Inc.", "James D.

Several mission types cause a small battle. It also has a mish-mash set of original units: A ring of raiders, renegades and ruffians eventually expands to eclectic exotic equipment as the Consortium appropriates everything it can lay its hands on.

The skirmish mode includes maps for the new planets alongside the previous maps, with the optional feature of having a third player on the map.

It is best known for its full three-dimensional movement, engrossing storyline and unique soundtrack...<br/>Homeworld is known both for its multi-player online and single-player elements. The player may choose to play as either the Kushan or Taiidan, both online and in the single-player campaign. While each unit serves a particular function and represents a tradeoff in strength, offensive power, speed, and cost, the differences between the two factions are mostly in cosmetic ship design. Parallel ships (the &quot;Vengeance&quot;-class Kushan Assault Frigate versus the &quot;Kudaark&quot;-class Taiidani Assault Frigate) look different but have identical armor, speed, weapons power, etc - although tests have shown that the Kushan Assault Frigate has a tendency to survive longer due to the way its turrets give it an almost 360&deg; firing arc. However, each race does feature two unique units (the Kushan Cloaking Fighter and Drone Frigate versus the Taiidani Defense Fighter and Defense Field Frigate), and equivalent ships often have different gun positioning, usually in favor of the Taiidan.<br/><br/>The screen is devoted entirely to maximize the field of view, so the only toolbar is hidden and appears only when the cursor is moved to the bottom of the screen. Orders such as moving and formations are given both from right-click menus, and hotkeys for more advanced gameplay.<br/><br/>The inclusion of unrestricted unit movement in all three dimensions adds a tactical dynamic not encountered in typical ground based real time strategy games where movement is on a two dimensional plane. Since the area of play is generally void of significant obstacles to create &quot;terrain&quot;, there is little emphasis on the control of a certain choke point in order to establish defensive perimeters...<br/>The single-player campaign includes 16 missions, and focuses on a persistent fleet concept, which causes all ships built during a mission to appear in the next (as long as they are not destroyed). The ultimate goal of the single player mode is to find the Homeworld of the chosen protagonist race, though the vantage point will remain unchanged regardless of the player's actual choice of race (in this and subsequent Homeworld games, the Kushan, called Hiigaran in &quot;Homeworld 2&quot;, are the canonical &quot;heroes&quot;)...<br/>Homeworld can also be played in a deathmatch mode where the player can choose the number of opponents, the map, enabling or disabling researching and fuel consumption. These games can be played with up to seven computer-controlled opponents, which have an adjustable difficulty setting and a setting that allows you to determine whether they attack the human player or other computers more often...<br/>Homeworld's original multiplayer lobby system was closed in October of 2008. To play online the player needed to create an account and download the latest patch (or version). However, users are still able to play online through usage of third-party solutions such as GameRanger and Hamachi.<br/><br/>&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Homeworld,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74249": {"poll": [], "name": "Homeworld 2", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["IT Windows PC Release", "US Mac Version", "US Windows Version"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic755908.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Homeworld"], "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction", "Space"], "usersrated": "50", "videogamedeveloper": ["Relic Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["Real Time Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Macintosh", "Windows"], "videogamehonor": ["2003 Game Critics Best Strategy Game of the Year Nominee", "2004 D.I.C.E.

Delveloped by Krome Studios under the name Beam Software and published by Mattel in 1991, and released only in Australia. It was the first AFL themed video game ever released and also included some of the very first spoken voice recordings on the NES. (although the quality of these voice samples was dubious at best; they were often muffled and difficult to understand)<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>The game involves playing a game of Australian rules football from a third-person perspective, with the ability to perform the basic actions of a typical Australian rules football player. The game can be played by one person playing against the computer team, or by two players against each other. There is also a kick to kick mode, and a season mode where 1, 4 or 6 players can play multiple games in a season finishing with a grand final.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is for the players team to have the highest score at the end of the game. A team can score by kicking either a goal (6 points) or a behind (1 point). To move the football, a player with the ball can either kick or handball the ball, and a player without the ball can either mark the ball or tackle an opposition player with the ball. See the Australian rules football article for more information on the basic rules of the game.<br/><br/>Controls<br/>In Aussie Rules Footy the basic controls are:<br/><br/>Player with the ball:<br/>A - handball<br/>B - kick<br/><br/>Player without the ball:<br/>A - mark<br/>B - tackle<br/><br/>Scoring<br/>When a player is close to the goal (approx. 55-60 metres), an accuracy bar appears at the bottom of the screen. When the ball is kicked, the closer the marker is to the centre of the bar, the more accurate the kick to goal. The accuracy bar makes it considerably difficult to kick a goal on the run, especially from a distance. When a player is very close to the goal (approx. 15 metres), the accuracy marker will always be in the centre of the bar and any kick by the player will be a goal.<br/><br/>Start of play<br/>As in the real rules of Australian rules football, there are times in play where a player from each team tries to take possession of the ball that has been bounced (for the start of play after a goal, or a ball-up), or thrown (for an out of bounds) by the umpire. During a bounce, using the arrow keys will start the player moving, only after the ball has touched the ground. Pressing A at the moment of contact will tap the ball to another team member, while pressing B will knock the ball a larger distance but not to a particular player. During a ball up or a boundary throw in, pressing A will make the player leap into the air, and then the same actions apply as a bounce when the player reaches the ball with his hand.<br/><br/>Teams<br/>The teams in the game are based on 14 of 15 teams in the 1991 AFL season. However, despite West Coast Eagles players being depicted on the games cover, within the game itself the Western Australian team was simply known as Perth. In addition, there are the teams, Darwin, Canberra and Hobart, who were fictional teams.<br/><br/>&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Aussie_Rules_Footy,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74277": {"videogame": ["CSI: Crime Scene Investigation Super Pack"], "poll": [], "name": "CSI: Hard Evidence", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Australian Mac OS X Release", "Australian PC Release", "Australian XBox 360 Release", "English/UK Mac OS X Release", "English/UK PC Release", "English/UK Wii Release", "English/UK XBox360  Release", "US Mac OS X Release", "US PC Release", "US Wii Release", "US XBox360 Release"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic808442.jpg", "videogameseries": ["CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"], "videogametheme": ["Detective / Mystery"], "videogamefranchise": ["CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Telltale Games", "TransGaming Technologies"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Macintosh", "Wii", "Windows", "Xbox 360"], "usersrated": "5", "average": "5.2", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Ubisoft Entertainment S.A.

Two to seven players compete to establish their empires, responding to unexpected discoveries that could represent either a boon or a challenge. The blank map of Africa is before you; will Great Britain build an empire from Cairo to the Cape of Good Hope, will the French restore their pride with an empire second to none, or will other imperial powers old and new claim a place in the sun? <br/> Scramble for Africa recreates the European partition of Africa in the final decades of the nineteenth century, combining a strong historical theme and the random element of discovery with a simple positional game system reminiscent of the Japanese game of go. Each player manages one of the great imperial powers, exploring, staking claims, and developing areas. Intended as an introductory game for the uninitiated or light entertainment for the veteran, Scramble for Africa will appeal to &quot;Euro&quot; gamers and historical gamers alike. <br/> Played on an authentic 19th-century map of Africa, Scramble for Africa includes two scenarios, one historical and one hypothetical, each playable in under two hours.

The game was developed and published by Nintendo, and was released in 1984 in Japan. The ducks appear one or two at a time, and the player is given three shots to shoot them down.<br/><br/>Duck Hunt was one of the two original pack-in titles for the first release of the game system. The game was not initially reviewed often, but given mediocre critical praise and positive gamer reaction. Prior to the NES version, Nintendo also made a Duck Hunt game based on Laser Clay Shooting System released in 1976.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>In Duck Hunt, players use the Nintendo Zapper Light Gun and attempt to shoot down either ducks or clay pigeons in mid-flight. Duck Hunt was also released as an arcade game in 1984, as Vs. Duck Hunt, and is included in the PlayChoice-10 arcade console.<br/><br/>The game has three modes:<br/>One Duck - In each round, there are 10 ducks for the player to shoot down. Only one duck appears on screen at a time, and the player has three shots to hit it. <br/>Two Ducks - Identical to &quot;One Duck&quot; except that the ducks appear on screen in pairs. A new pair of ducks will not appear until both of the previous pair have either escaped or been shot down. <br/>Clay Shooting - In each round, there are 10 clay pigeons for the player to shoot down. Clay pigeons are fired off two at a time from a first person perspective and are aimed into the distance. In Vs. Duck Hunt, Clay Shooting mode appears as the second round with the first round being the two duck variation (the arcade version never had one duck). <br/>In the first two modes, a dog retrieves the ducks a player shoots, and laughs at the player if both of the birds on screen escape (and if the player fails to advance to the next level).<br/><br/><br/>The dog being shot in Vs. Duck Hunt.During bonus stages in Vs. Duck Hunt the dog jumps out from the grass as a distraction to the player as they try to shoot ducks, thus putting himself in the line of fire and enabling a player to inadvertently shoot him. If the dog is shot, the bonus round ends.<br/><br/>Several unofficial remakes of Duck Hunt have been released which enable the player to shoot the dog. The nameless dog makes a cameo appearance in the NES game Barker Bill's Trick Shooting (another Zapper game) and he can be shot.<br/><br/>While Duck Hunt does not have a traditional multiplayer mode, the manual states that a second player may plug in a standard NES controller in the other controller port and control the duck that appears. This option is only possible in the one duck mode.<br/><br/>Development<br/>Nintendo Research &amp; Development 1 created the game. They also developed the Light Gun used in Duck Hunt. The game was supervised by Takehiro Izushi, and was produced by Gunpei Yokoi.<br/><br/>Packaging<br/>Duck Hunt has been placed in several combination cartridges. In the Action Set configuration of the NES in the late 1980s, Duck Hunt was included with Super Mario Bros.. This particular cartridge is found very often in the United States, due to it being included with the purchase of a NES. A Power Set was also available, which included the Action Set, the Power Pad and a 3-in-1 cartridge that included Duck Hunt, World Class Track Meet and Super Mario Bros.<br/><br/>Audio<br/>Clay Shooting releases two clay pigeons at once.The original music was composed by K\u014dji Kond\u014d and Hirokazu Tanaka, both of whom did music for several other Nintendo games at the time.[The game's music was represented in the classic games medley on the Video Games Live concert tour.<br/><br/>Legacy<br/>Allgame called the game an &quot;attractive but repetitive target shooter&quot; and &quot;utterly mindless... the game is fun for a short time, but gets old after a few rounds of play.&quot; Several user groups have rated the game positively. 1UP.com users gave it an 8.7 out of 10, and the GameSpot community gave the Mario-Duck Hunt package a 9.1 out of 10. It was rated the 150th best game made on a Nintendo System in Nintendo Power's Top 200 Games list. IGN also placed the game at number 77 on its &quot;Top 100 NES Games of All Time&quot; feature.<br/><br/>Spinoffs (user submission)<br/>There are several iPhone apps that have been directly inspire by Duck Hunt. Titles include Duck Hunter, Duck Hunting and iDuck Hunt. iDuck Hunt is available on the iPad as iDuck Hunt HD. These titles have not been included as releases in the VGG entry because they were not officially licensed or developed, and may differ significantly from the original.<br/><br/>Wii Play introduced players (and potential developers) to the basic applications of motion control possible on the Nintendo Wii.

It was released in Japan for the Famicom on February 18, 1984 (1984-02-18) and alongside the launch of the NES in North America in October 1985. The Famicom version of the Zapper, made for the game Wild Gunman, resembled a revolver-style handgun, but the North American version resembled a futuristic science fiction ray gun that also tied into the design of the NES. Early versions of the Zapper were a dark gray, but its color was later changed to orange, as was now required for all &quot;toy guns&quot; under U.S. Federal Regulations. Although originally included in some configurations of the NES, the Zapper was available for purchase separately.<br/><br/>The Zapper allows players to aim at the television monitor and shoot various objects such as ducks, clay pigeons, targets, cowboys, or criminals, or other objects. Pulling the trigger emits a loud, characteristic noise akin to a combination of a high-tensile spring snapping and a mechanical &quot;click&quot;.<br/><br/>History and usage<br/>The Zapper was first released in 1985 with the launch of the NES in North America. It came bundled with the NES console, the Robotic Operating Buddy and two games Duck Hunt and Gyromite.<br/><br/>The Zapper is used on supported NES games such as Duck Hunt and Wild Gunman. To hit targets on the screen, players point the device by lining up the front and rear sights with the desired target and pulling the trigger. The Zapper could also be used on the title screens of games to move the cursor done by pointing the device away from the screen and pulling the trigger or starting the game (pointing at the screen and pulling the trigger).<br/><br/>When the trigger on the Zapper is pressed, the game causes the entire screen to become black for one frame. Then, on the next frame, the target area is drawn in all white as the rest of the screen remains black. The Zapper detects this change from low light to bright light, as well as which frame the change was detected. This is how the game knows which target has been hit.After all target areas have been illuminated, the game returns to drawing graphics as usual. Another technique involves making the entire screen black in one frame and white in the next. Calculations are used to determine electron beam position. This technique works only on conventional CRT television sets; modern plasma or LCD screens are incompatible with this method.In either case, the whole process is almost imperceptible to the human eye, although one can notice a slight &quot;flashing&quot; of the image.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;NES Zapper&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74297": {"poll": [], "name": "Marvel vs Capcom: Clash of Superheroes", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Dreamcast edition", "North American PlayStation edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1085624.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Marvel vs Capcom"], "videogametheme": ["Comics", "Superhero"], "videogamefranchise": ["Marvel", "Street Fighter"], "videogamecharacter": ["Chun-Li", "Mega Man", "Ryu", "Zangief"], "usersrated": "13", "videogamedeveloper": ["Capcom Co., Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Beat 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation", "Sega Dreamcast"], "vgcharacterversion": ["Mech-Zangief"], "average": "7", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Capcom Co., Ltd."], "videogamecompilation": ["Marvel Vs.

When enemies appear, they are accompanied by a box showing a word, sentence or phrase which must be typed to neutralize the enemy. The length, and complexity, of the phrases increase during the game's progression. Other features retained include the challenges of saving survivors, which will alter the path the player character will take to his final destination, and the secrets/bonus items hidden throughout the game.<br/><br/>All levels contain specific challenge areas, where the player is required to kill a certain number of zombies in limited time, and are ended with a boss battle using some sort of alteration of usual gameplay (e.g. a long phrase, typing the correct answer to a question etc.) The console ports have two modes, &quot;Original&quot; and &quot;Arcade,&quot; for the main storyline, as well as &quot;Tutorial,&quot; &quot;Drill,&quot; and &quot;Boss&quot; modes for additional typing training.

Each of those days is presented as its own scenario. THD puts you in control of British Fighter Command, responding to air raids launched by the Luftwaffe, which is controlled by the game system.<br/><br/>Each one-day scenario represents up to 14 hours during which the Luftwaffe launches raids against targets in southern England, defended by the squadrons of RAF Fighter Command. German raids include bomber Gruppen (groups), attempting to hit specific targets, and fighter groups protecting those bombers and attacking British fighter squadrons. The German goal is twofold: inflict damage on targets and destroy squadrons to gain air superiority in preparation for the invasion of England.<br/><br/>The game system controls German strategy and tactics. You use your fighter squadrons to respond to the raids in an attempt to destroy or turn back the raiders and prevent their effective bombing of their targets, while minimizing your own fighter losses. Your fighter squadrons and German fighter groups may participate in several raids in a given day, while German bombers, flying from distant bases, participate in only one raid per day. To track the passage of time, as measured by the sequencing of raids and the turnaround of squadrons and groups during each &ldquo;Raid Day,&rdquo; the action is divided into seven two-hour time segments, from 0600 to 1800 hours, inclusive.<br/><br/>One inch on the area map equals 10 miles.

The assumption is, when Hitler ordered his army to march into the Rhineland, the Allied powers, instead of appeasing him, ordered their armed forces to resist. The ensuing chain of events leads to the war expanding throughout Europe. A war fought at that time would&rsquo;ve found all European militaries woefully unprepared.<br/><br/>Central to the play of the game are its &ldquo;crisis chits.&rdquo; They represent various diplomatic and military events that could bring other powers into the war. Players pick crisis chits depending on the number of crisis hexes (printed on the map) they control. The more such hexes they control, the greater the chances they have of gaining more allies. At the same time, grabbing too much territory can lead to political collapse at home, as domestic foes work to undermine your power before the conflict explodes into a wider war.<br/><br/>Rhineland Crisis War is a two-player game. One player commands the Axis, controlling Germany and the countries that choose to align with Berlin. The other is the Allied player, who controls the anti-German forces. Each hex on the map represents 62 miles (100 km) from side to opposite side. Each full game turn represents one month.

However, it was decided to pass on the release of Earth Bound and to localize Mother 2 under the title EarthBound.

Perhaps the most notable instance of streamlining is the combat system. Rather than having multiple units battling it out at once, combat is one-on-one, similar to a collectible card game. A player will choose which unit they wish to send into battle, and so will the computer (or the other player in multiplayer games). The units will then battle to the death, with no retreating. Once a unit is killed, the player or computer sends in another, and so on, until one side is victorious. Surrender is not an option during or between battles. Spells can be cast before or between battles that will help to increase the chance of success. Groups or &quot;stacks&quot; of units can number up to eight for traveling parties or up to sixteen units for cities.<br/><br/>The basic flow of the game consists of producing units in cities, based on the amount of resources currently available to the player, and then sending those units out to conquer other cities and/or explore ruins, while learning spells along the way. The amount of time it takes to produce a unit, move a unit to a place on the map, and learn a spell is determined by a specified number of turns. For example, a weak unit or a common spell make take one or two turns to produce or learn; while a powerful unit may take as much as four turns to produce and a rare or &quot;arcane&quot; spell may take as much as sixteen turns to learn. While the player is performing these steps, the opposing player(s) are as well. As many as eight players can play a game at a time. These can be any mixture of human or AI players. The game ends once all but one warlord (player) is defeated. The object of the game is to capture enemy cities, which will result in more resources and units. Cities come in four levels and can be upgraded at the cost of gold. A higher-level city can produce more powerful units and is more-resistant to enemy sieges. The player can also explore different ruins which dot the map, which can yield great amounts of experience points, magical items which can be used by hero units (discussed below), additional resources, or additional combat units. Depending on the surrounding buildings a player's capital city has, quests may become available which consist of the player clearing out four random ruins on the map as steps towards a great reward. These can help increase the power of a player's army.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Warlords_IV:_Heroes_of_Etheria,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74334": {"videogame": ["Call of Duty Deluxe Edition", "Call of Duty: War Chest"], "poll": [], "name": "Call of Duty: United Offensive", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/EU Windows edition", "IT Windows PC Release", "North America Windows edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic755830.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Call of Duty (Core Series)"], "videogametheme": ["War - World War II"], "videogamegenre": ["First Person Shooter"], "videogameexpansion": ["Call of Duty"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Gray Matter Interactive"], "videogamefranchise": ["Call of Duty"], "videogameplatform": ["Macintosh", "Windows"], "usersrated": "46", "average": "7.76087", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Activision"], "videogamecompilation": ["Call of Duty Deluxe Edition", "Call of Duty: War Chest"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic755830_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Call of Duty: United Offensive is an expansion pack for the popular first-person shooter computer game, Call of Duty.

Scott Riley, the United Kingdom as Sgt. James Doyle and the Soviet Union as Pvt. Yuri Petrenko. The game also includes historical battles, such as the Battle of the Bulge, Battle of Kursk, and the Invasion of Sicily. A minor deviation from the original game is a bombing mission in which the player mans several M2 Browning machine guns. Several new abilities are added to the game as well, including the ability to actually deploy light machine guns, use flamethrowers, to sprint; which makes the character run faster but at the cost of not being able to fire their weapon, and the ability to &quot;cook&quot; grenades (allowing the fuse to burn somewhat before throwing the grenade).<br/><br/>The biggest changes made by United Offensive are in the multiplayer aspect of the game. There are new maps which are much larger than the ones in the original game, new weapons from the single player campaign, an in-game rank system which grants additional bonuses with more points, and vehicles such as tanks and jeeps.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Call_of_Duty:_United_Offensive,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74335": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic755839.jpg", "videogametheme": ["War - World War II"], "videogamegenre": ["First Person Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Macintosh", "Windows"], "poll": [], "videogamecompilation": ["Medal of Honor Allied Assault, Battlefield 1942 & Command & Conquer Generals"], "statistics": [], "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Dutch EA Games Top Series Windows edition", "Dutch Windows edition", "Italian Windows edition", "North American Macintosh (Deluxe Edition) edition", "North American Windows edition"], "videogamecharacter": ["Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger Ausf.

It is the first game in a series with the same name. The game simulates the infantry  and combined arms warfare of World War II. The game is based on the Quake III: Team Arena engine. It was accompanied in September 2004 by an expansion pack, Call of Duty: United Offensive, which was produced by Activision, and developed by Gray Matter Interactive, with contributions from Pi Studios. Call of Duty is similar in theme and gameplay to Medal of Honor, as it is made out of single-player campaigns and missions. However, unlike Medal of Honor, the war is seen not just from the viewpoint of an American soldier but also from the viewpoint of British and Soviet soldiers.<br/><br/>The game is somewhat unusual in that throughout the single-player mode, the player is joined by computer-controlled allies who range in quantity from two infantrymen (in some of the British missions) to an entire regiment of tanks (in the Soviet missions). The computer-controlled allies will support the actual player during the missions. They also further the game's goal of providing an immersive and realistic experience; that is, soldiers in World War II were usually part of a larger group, as opposed to the &quot;lone wolf&quot; seen in video games such as Wolfenstein 3D. However, there are some missions where the player is alone.<br/><br/>Call of Duty also featured &quot;shellshock&quot; (not to be confused with the psychological condition of the same name): when there is an explosion near the player, he momentarily experiences simulated tinnitus, appropriate sound &quot;muffling&quot; effects, blurred vision, and the action moves slower.<br/><br/>The &quot;Hardened&quot; and &quot;Prestige&quot; editions of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, released on November 10, 2009, includes a redemption code to download the game onto Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 hard drives, retitling it as Call of Duty: Classic.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Call_of_Duty_(video_game),&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74338": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic785969.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy", "Moral Choices"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Macintosh", "Windows"], "poll": [], "videogamecompilation": ["Baldur's Gate 4 in 1 Boxset", "Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition", "Baldur's Gate II: The Collection", "Black Isle Compilation Part Two", "Dungeons and Dragons Anthology: The Master Collection", "Forgotten Realms Deluxe Edition", "Ultimate Dungeons & Dragons"], "statistics": [], "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Windows edition", "French Windows edition", "German Windows edition", "North American Macintosh edition", "North American Windows edition"], "videogamecharacter": ["Aerie", "Anomen Delryn", "Biff the Understudy", "Cernd", "Cespenar", "Dynaheir", "Edwin Odesseiron", "Haer'Dalis", "Imoen", "Jaheira", "Jan Jansen", "Keldorn Firecam", "Khalid", "Korgan Bloodaxe", "Mazzy Fentan", "Minsc", "Nalia de'Arnise", "Quayle", "Sarevok Anchev", "Valygar Corthala", "Viconia DeVir", "Yoshimo"], "vgcharacterversion": ["Aerie", "Anomen", "Biff the Understudy", "Cernd", "Dead Yoshimo", "Dynaheir", "Edwin", "Haer'Dalis", "Imoen", "Jaheira", "Jan", "Keldorn", "Khalid", "Korgan", "Main Series Version", "Mazzy", "Minsc", "Nalia", "Quayle", "Sarevok", "Valygar Corthala", "Viconia"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic785969_t.jpg", "videogame": ["Baldur's Gate 4 in 1 Boxset", "Baldur's Gate II: The Collection", "Dungeons and Dragons Anthology: The Master Collection", "Forgotten Realms Deluxe Edition", "Ultimate Dungeons & Dragons"], "description": "[User Summary]:<br/><br/>Throne of Bhaal is the last chapter of the Baldur's Gate saga.

For character levels 4-6.<br/><br/>Synopsis:<br/><br/>1,000 years ago, a race of locust-like inter-dimensional humanoids known as the villoi came to the Prime Material Plane on a colonization mission. In the name of their deity, the Hive Queen, they initiated the construction fortified temples in the forested regions to the northwest of Cannabaudes.Once completed, the temples became the base of operations for a campaign of terror against the good peoples of the regions surrounding Cannabaudes. Their hit and run attacks instilled fear across the region. After many decades, the villoi abandoned the Prime Material Plane. But a few enclaves of the vile creatures remained behind, hidden deep within their mighty temples. These communes of villoi entered into an artificially induced hibernation, in the hopes of being resuscitated in later centuries by new and hopefully more formidable ambassadors of their race, and continue their plague upon the inhabitants of the Verm&amp;eacute;an continent.And now the villoi have been awakened from their centuries-long slumber by an evil greater even than themselves. Can your party of intrepid adventurers stop the combined menace before all the lands are over-run? Enter the lands west of the infamous Blood Pass to uncover the secret, and thwart The Awakening.An all new adventure based in the Usherwood Adventures campaign setting, by Alphonso Warden.

The game was developed by Shiny Entertainment, released for the Mega Drive/Genesis in 1994, and subsequently ported to the SNES, Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Master System, and years later, the Game Boy Advance. Upon its release it was praised for its detailed animation, polished gameplay and surreal humor; it became the first game ever to receive a 100% review in GamesMaster magazine. A special edition of the game was released for the Sega CD which features a Red Book audio soundtrack, improved graphics and expanded levels, and an even further enhanced version with redrawn, 256 colour graphics and an Earthworm Jim desktop theme, as well as all the Sega CD improvements, was released for Microsoft Windows 95. The Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version was released through Wii's Virtual Console service in Europe on October 3, 2008, and in North America on October 27, 2008. Gameloft released a version for the iPhone and Symbian S60 Devices; and has recently developed an HD version for Xbox Live Arcade.<br/><br/>Plot<br/>The storyline involves many colorful characters. Jim himself (a character designed by Doug TenNapel) was at first an ordinary Earth earthworm who did very earthworm-like things such as flee from crows and eat dirt. One day, in the space above Earth, the evil Psy-Crow had cornered a rebel spaceship pilot who had stolen an &quot;Ultra-high-tech-indestructible-super-space-cyber-suit&quot; built by Professor Monkey-For-A-Head. The suit had been commissioned by the evil Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Pus-filled, Malformed, Slug-for-a-Butt so that she could further conquer the galaxy. In the ensuing space fight, the suit was dropped to Earth, and fell on Jim. By a stroke of luck, Jim managed to land within the collar of the suit, and it ended up mutating him into the large and intelligent (at least by earthworm standards) superhero he is today.<br/><br/>Jim overhears Psy-Crow talking to Queen Slug-for-a-Butt about the scorch marks left by the suit and her plans for her sister, Princess What's-Her-Name. Jim thus sets out to rescue the princess, fighting many enemies along the way, such as Major Mucus, Chuck and Fifi, Evil the Cat and Bob the Killer Goldfish, although none of this is apparent throughout the game.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Earthworm Jim in the 'New Junk City' level on Super NintendoThe gameplay of Earthworm Jim could be considered bizarre. Launching cows, using Jim's head as a whip, and other bizarre twists add to the insanity. The player controls Jim at all times of the game. In the level sections, Jim can run, use his gun, swing on hooks, and get powerups for the blaster. The in-between levels called Andy Asteroids place Jim in a semi-3D race against the evil Psycrow. If Psycrow wins, then Jim must fight him in one-on-one combat in order to progress. Throughout the game were many added features, such as mini-bosses whose weaknesses Jim would need to find through trial and error. Crystal treadmills, underwater pod races, and other related things also appear.<br/><br/>Cameos<br/>Shiny have also made references to Earthworm Jim in its later titles; their game Sacrifice features an earthworm-like god called James, and there were additional references in the game MDK. Over ten years after its original release, Earthworm Jim was the featured game in Nintendo Power's first ever edition of Playback. On the PC CD-ROM version of the game there is an Assets folder, containing a PC desktop theme and another folder named EWJ_DT00. This folder contains a picture of a boy wearing a white Snoopy shirt standing next to a screen, the words &quot;Tin with 1,000,000 points in Activision's Laser Blast, from 1982.&quot; written in white at the top. The remaining file is a wave file 26 seconds long of someone cussing while playing Earthworm Jim, with increasing frustration due to repeatedly &quot;getting hurt&quot; on the game. Earthworm Jim also appears as a secret character in the first Battle Arena Toshinden game for PC.<br/>&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Earthworm_Jim,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74357": {"rpgartist": ["Sam Inabinet", "Greg Porter"], "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Renegade Dreams", "rpgdesigner": ["Greg Porter"], "rpgproducer": ["Greg Porter"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic755939.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Cyberpunk)"], "rpgpublisher": ["BTRC (Blacksburg Tactical Research Center)"], "rpg": ["SpaceTime"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic755939_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>From the back of the book<br/><br/>You don't hear the constant drone of the street, or the blaring ads of the video billboards.

It is a sequel to the original Earthworm Jim. The music was composed by game music veteran Tommy Tallarico. Earthworm Jim 2 follows the exploits of annelid superhero Jim and his new sidekick Snott as they try to rescue Jim's beloved Princess What's-Her-Name from a forced marriage to the nefarious Psy-Crow. While chasing them across the universe, Jim comes across the summer homes of a number of villains from the first game, including Evil the Cat and Bob the Killer Goldfish.<br/><br/>The game originally appeared on the Mega Drive/Genesis, Super NES and the PC operating system MS-DOS, with enhanced versions later released on the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. It was also ported to the Game Boy Advance in 2002 and the Wii Virtual Console in 2009. Like the original game, Earthworm Jim 2 contains a lot of irreverent, surrealist humor. It also features more diverse gameplay than the original, with each stage having a different style and mission, as well as various new weapons.<br/><br/>Gameplay is much more diverse than in the first Earthworm Jim, largely departing from the template of a standard platformer. Although the majority of levels are based on platformer elements, they also incorporate gameplay from a variety of different genres, including mazes, trivia contests, arcade game style levels, and a marathon race which acts as the game's final level in lieu of a boss battle. Many levels are heavily non-linear and are navigated in an unusual manner.<br/><br/>For instance in the third level 'The Villi People/Jim's Now A Blind Cave Salamander!', the player must guide Jim, defenceless in the guise of a blind cave salamander, through intestinal passages while avoiding exploding sheep and hazards embedded in the floor and walls. In another, the player controls Jim as he floats upward through a warped circus setting by means of his inflated head, avoiding touching sharp objects and light bulbs which will cause him to fall to the start of the level.<br/><br/>Jim's movement has changed from the original Earthworm Jim. For instance, he can no longer use his head to swing or to hover like a helicopter. Instead, Jim is accompanied by a living mucus named Snott, who resides in Jim's backpack and allows him to float by morphing into a parachute and swing by sticking on ceilings that are covered with dripping goo.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Earthworm_Jim_2,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74373": {"poll": [], "name": "Outlaw Golf", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/UK Playstation 2 edition", "English/UK XBox edition", "EU GameCube edition", "Japanese XBox World Collection edition", "US GameCube edition", "US Windows edition", "US XBox edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic809510.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Sports - Golf"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogamecharacter": ["Harley (Outlaw Sports)", "Ice Trey", "Killer Miller", "El Suave", "Suki", "Summer (Outlaw Sports)", "Trixie"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Hypnotix"], "videogamefranchise": ["Outlaw Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["GameCube", "Windows", "Xbox"], "usersrated": "5", "average": "6.3", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Microsoft Game Studios", "Simon and Schuster", "TDK Mediactive"], "vgcharacterversion": ["El Suave", "Harley", "Ice Trey", "Killer Miller", "Suki", "Summer", "Trixie"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic809510_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Players take control of 10 playable characters, each with their own unique caddy.

And as such, a planned PlayStation version of the game was cancelled.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Earthworm Jim 3D borrows much of its gameplay from other platformers of the era, notably Banjo-Kazooie and Super Mario 64. New locations in Jim's brain are opened up by collecting Golden Udders, and new levels in each location are opened by collecting Jim's marbles. Like previous Earthworm Jim games, despite many platforming elements, Jim's primary method of combat comes from shooting his Blaster.<br/><br/>Plot<br/>Earthworm Jim is hit by a flying cow that sends him into a coma. Jim awakens within his own mind and discovers he has gone insane. His past villains have entered his mind and if something doesn't happen soon, Jim will be in the coma forever. His super ego has been unleashed within his mind to stop the madness. To restore his sanity he must find the golden udders of lucidity.<br/> Main characters<br/>Earthworm Jim - The hero of the game. After getting hit by a falling cow, Jim's worst fears and anxieties were unleashed and are destroying his psyche. As a last line of defense, Jim's four worm brains embody Jim as his own superego, and send him out to collect his marbles to repair his damaged IQ. When he starts off the game, he's as smart as pond scum. More levels within Jim's brains open as Jim gets smarter. <br/>Peter Puppy - Earthworm Jim's friend. He basically tells Jim inside of his mind what happened after the cow fell on him and what to do about the resulting turmoil his mind is in. <br/>Snott - A booger who is also Jim's friend. He appears from time to time, giving Jim hints and telling him how to perform moves. <br/>The Sacred Cow of Contemplation - A cow that controls the portals to Jim's brains. His powers can only be recharged when Jim finds Golden Udders. He is a master of disguise (i.e., he wears an afro in Fear, a chef hat in Happiness, a cowboy hat in Fantasy and an army hat in Memory).<br/><br/>Jim's Mind<br/>When Jim enters his mind, he finds out that his four mind chambers have been taken over by his worst fears. He must collect Golden Udders to unlock the other three chambers and Green Marbles to unlock the levels within the chamber.<br/><br/>Development<br/>During its drawn-out three year development cycle, Earthworm Jim 3D changed publishers several times. This caused some problems as the game was based on the Earthworm Jim TV series which by the time of release, had been off the air for over 3 years. Also many locations displayed in early versions of the game are nowhere to be found in the released copy (such as a level set in a house, where Jim is ant-sized), and locations that were kept from early screenshots changed drastically before release. In some cases, entire characters were changed - originally, Evil the Cat was to be the boss of Fear, but was changed to Professor Monkey-For-A-Head at the last moment, although his face can be seen on the records and record needles in the level &quot;Boogie Nights of the Living Dead&quot;. Additionally, Evil Jim, Earthworm Jim's evil twin from the TV series, was reportedly a part of the game. Early screenshots also display Jim riding his Pocket Rocket.<br/><br/>The characters of Earthworm Jim had to be redesigned for the shift to 3D. When the game was almost three quarters done, it suffered from framerate problems and poor animation.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Earthworm_Jim_3D,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74377": {"poll": [], "name": "Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Windows edition", "UK Windows edition", "UK Xbox edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic757031.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Spy / Espionage", "War - Modern"], "usersrated": "17", "videogamedeveloper": ["Raven Software"], "videogamegenre": ["First Person Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows", "Xbox"], "average": "6.32353", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Activision"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic757031_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix is a video game created by Raven Software, a sequel to Soldier of Fortune.

It was developed by Computer Artworks. A PlayStation 2 version of this game was released in North America on August 19, 2002, and in Japan on February 27, 2003.<br/><br/>The game used a fear system and a trust system to increase the realism of the game. This was implemented by making it possible for one of the player's teammates to be 'turned', and for the player to not realize that until it was too late.<br/><br/>In the trust system, the player may lose the trust of his squad if he kills a teammate on the belief that that teammate had been 'turned'. The squad would react to the killing depending on if the slain teammate was or wasn't 'turned'. If the teammate had been 'turned', the squad will praise you for killing him. However, if the teammate was still human, the squad will lose faith in you and may even try to kill you.<br/><br/>In the fear system, the squad reacts to the environment of an area. An area that is covered in blood, or an area where there is a lot of wreckage present, might inspire fear in the squad. Also, the number of 'things' present or the sizes of the 'things' may frighten the squad members. The individual members of the squad may react in one of three ways:<br/><br/>1. The teammate runs away.<br/><br/>2. The teammate becomes irrational and begins shooting (with both regular guns and flamethrowers) indiscriminately. As this places the player and the squad in significant danger, the player often has to kill this teammate. If the player kills this teammate, the squad will neither gain nor lose trust in the player.<br/><br/>3. The teammate will simply give up and commit suicide.<br/><br/>There are several different ways that a player may kill a 'thing'. A small 'thing' may be shot to death, while a larger 'thing' will have to be shot to near death with a regular gun and then torched with a flamethrower. This does not carry over to the boss 'things'; it varies from situation to situation as to whether a player can kill the boss with a traditional gun or kill the boss with the flamethrower.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The_Thing_(video_game),&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74379": {"poll": [], "name": "Power Blade", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["EU NES Edition", "NA NES Edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1290864.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Power Blade"], "usersrated": "10", "videogamedeveloper": ["Natsume"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["NES"], "average": "6.3", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Taito"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1290864_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Power Blade, known in Japan as Power Blazer (\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30d6\u30ec\u30b6\u30fc), is an action platform video game developed by Natsume and published by Taito for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

The reworking included a complete overhaul of the levels, a change of the look of the main character from a cartoon like robot to an Arnold Schwarzenegger look alike, and a significant improvement in gameplay controls. The game's name comes from an item found in several levels; The Power Suit is an item that looks like a helmet. When collected Nova automatically equips the metal suit.

The gameplay could be compared to Halo but is closer to the Rainbow Six game series, or Star Wars Republic Commando.<br/><br/>Squads can be commanded into various formations or ordered to regroup, ceasefire and various other commands. Squad members can share ammunition and heal one another. They can also fix vehicles or be left on top of a mountain (for example) to provide cover for other members.

In this respect, players can choose to tackle many of the missions in several different ways.<br/><br/>The player shoots his way through numerous enemies and completes mission objectives given to them by the commander.

There is a heads-up display which shows the player's ammunition count, armor, and equipped weapon, as well as a compass and squad commands. The player can carry two weapons at a time and there is a wide selection of weapons at one's disposal, everything from energy weapons like plasma cannons to your standard assault rifle and a few exotic alien weapons. There are also a range of vehicles such as an APC, jeep, and a space fighter which can be used at certain points in the game. Friendly gun emplacements can be used, such as the guns on the drop ship. Enemy gun emplacements can also be captured and used to your advantage. The single player AI can be left to control emplacements to give you covering fire. In a few instances players can pilot an aircraft from outer space, head through the Earth's atmosphere, then continue their journey down to the planet's surface.

The player takes on the role of Arthur King and is accompanied by two Knights of Justice controlled by the game console. The player battles enemies using a regular sword swing or a special attack, and can block high and low attacks.[2] Twelve Knights are available from the start (including Arthur King), each with his own weapon, personality and statistics for life force, defense, strength and speed. Each boss of the game has a specific weakness against one of the Knights.[3] Changing party members is done by visiting the Round Table room in Camelot.<br/><br/>Each character has a life meter, and Arthur also has a power meter.[4] Various items must be collected to complete quests and objectives, while some can be used to restore a character's life meter.[5] An overworld map feature allows the player to directly access locations already visited once. The game has no saving feature but allows accessing various points of the storyline with a system of passwords.<br/><br/>Plot<br/>The events of the game are set in a fictional England in the 5th century.[8] The evil sorceress Morgana has magically imprisoned King Arthur and the Knights of the Round in the Cave of Glass beneath her castle, past Hadrian's Wall. At Camelot, the King's wizard Merlin uses a crystal ball and locates a brave team of &quot;warriors&quot; in the future, led by Arthur King and dubbed &quot;The Knights&quot;. They are actually American football players, though Merlin interprets their names as a sign of fate. He summons them back in time, and the Lady of the Table transforms them into &quot;Knights of Justice&quot;. Merlin asks them to break the seal on King Arthur and the Knights of the Round by gathering the twelve Keys of Truth<br/><br/>The party retrieves the Excalibur sword from the Lady of the Lake, proving their worth by claiming the Pendragon Shield from a young dragon at Shield Heights. They assist Erek, the deposed ruler of Tintagel Castle, and recover the first Key of Truth in the castle. They make their way into the village of Welton, which is under a mind control spell, and recover the second Key of Truth at Gruesome Keep. After breaking the spell on Welton and crossing the Blinder's Way, they claim the third Key of Truth at Castle Sanguine.<br/><br/>During the event, a Warlord infiltrates Camelot and poisons Squire Everett. The party collects an antidote in the Swamp of Zagar and saves the Squire. They then claim the fourth Key of Truth in Stone Keep. They rescue the son of the Gnome King to obtain the fifth Key of Truth, and collects four Elemental Keys to unlock access to Castle Vilor and the sixth Key of Truth. The party finds the seventh and eighth Keys of Truth in Crownhorn village and the Cape of Death, respectively. The ninth and tenth Keys are found in Blackroot Keep and the Dark Citadel while searching for the missing pieces of the Staff of Rhiothamus, which can break open a path in Hadrian's Wall.<br/><br/>Using the Staff, the party goes past Hadrian's Wall and into the Dark Forest, where the eleventh Key of Truth is found. In a cemetery, they stumble upon a statue of Morgana, which fires a magic beam that kills the two Knights in the party. Arthur travels to the Town of the Dead by himself then to the Plain of the Dead and retrieves his two dead Knights. They reach Morgana's castle, Stone Gardens, and defeat Morgana's dragon form, thus obtaining the last Key of Truth. In the game's ending sequence, the party members are congratulated by the real, freed King Arthur, and Merlin uses Stonehenge to send them back to their era.<br/><br/>[edit] Development<br/>King Arthur &amp; the Knights of Justice was the first Enix game developed by an American company. The development team of the project was composed of roughly two dozen people. The game was initially planned for a 16-megabit cartridge, but 4 additional megabits were eventually added as the developers wanted to expand the game. Development spanned about two years.<br/><br/>In addition to the original cartoon series, the developers gathered ideas from several sources for inspiration, including The Legend of Zelda action-adventure game series, and books such as T. H. White's The Book of Merlyn and fables from Medieval poet Marie de France. They noted that the hardest part of development was coming up with puzzles for each of the regions, as they had to be &quot;fun and challenging, but not repetitive&quot;. While they tried to maintain a balance between action and puzzles, they noted that they focused more on the puzzle aspect of the game. Favorite parts of the game for the developers include the dragon battles, the boss Blackwing and Morgana's Warlords&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;King_Arthur_&amp;_the_Knights_of_Justice_(video_game),&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74390": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1289852.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Kevin G.

All racing in ProStreet takes place solely on closed tracks, making ProStreet the first game in the series since Need for Speed II that doesn't animate illegal racing. Rather, the type of racing appears to be Clubman Racing. The performance tuning feature is enhanced, compared to previous versions, especially Autosculpt. Unlike Carbon, where only certain body kits can be autosculpted, this can now be applied to all body kits, including stock bumpers and wide body kits. Furthermore, some adjustments through autosculpt impact the car's aerodynamics.<br/><br/>In ProStreet there are four different game modes: Drag (a race in a drag strip, point to point), Grip (similar to Circuit races but with four different types of Grip races available), Speed (similar to a Sprint race) and Drift.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Need_for_Speed:_ProStreet,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74412": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jeff Cisneros", "Scott Douglas", "Ed Greenwood", "Randall Lemon", "James Lowder", "Kevin Melka", "Erlene Mooney", "Roger E.

It was released on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, and mobile phone in November 2008. The game was later released on the iOS on April 27, 2009. The game takes place some time after Need for Speed: Carbon and some time before Need for Speed: World Online. According to EA, the game has sold over 5.2 million copies on all 8 platforms combined. Need for Speed: Undercover is also the very last Need for Speed game to be released for a sixth-generation gaming console (in this case, the PlayStation 2).<br/><br/>Undercover features a new open world map (like the Midnight Club series) consisting of 109 miles (175 km) of road and a large highway system, making it the largest Need for Speed &quot;world&quot; EA has created so far. The game's environment consists of four boroughs: Palm Harbor, Port Crescent, Gold Coast Mountains, and Sunset Hills. Some boroughs are the same as Need for Speed Most Wanted, just shifted to different positions. These four boroughs make up the city, Tri-City (referring to the real-life city in Tri-City, Oregon), presumably a city located on Gulf Coast. The road system includes four water crossings, going clockwise: the Main Guy Causeway (Ocean Expressway connecting Sunset Hills to Port Crescent via man-made island), the Vale Causeway (Sunset Hills to Palm Harbor), the North T Causeway (Man-made island to Palm Harbor), and the Memorial Tunnel (Port Crescent to Palm Harbor). Undercover also features a new continuous highway system. In previous installments, highways were relatively small circuits concentrated within separate boroughs. In Undercover, the main highway circles Tri-City, with each of the four boroughs sharing a piece of the larger circuit. The longer highway length gives a more realistic shape, with long straight areas, gentle curves, rest areas and large interchanges. Lastly, the entire map is open from the start of the game, unlike previous installments where boroughs had to be unlocked.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Need_for_Speed:_Undercover,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74414": {"poll": [], "name": "Need for Speed: Shift", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Australian Xbox 360 edition", "English/European PlayStation 3 (Special Editon) edition", "English/European Xbox 360 (Special Edition) edition", "English/European Xbox 360 edition", "German Windows edition", "iPhone edition", "North American PlayStation 3 edition", "North American Xbox 360 edition", "Russian PlayStation 3 edition", "Russian Windows edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic886032.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Need for Speed"], "videogametheme": ["Driving"], "usersrated": "19", "videogamedeveloper": ["EA Black Box", "Electronic Arts (EA)", "Slightly Mad Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Racing"], "videogameplatform": ["iPhone", "PlayStation 3", "Windows", "Xbox 360"], "videogamehonor": ["2009 Game Critics Best Racing Game of the Year Nominee", "2009 Spike Best Driving Game of the Year Nominee", "2010 D.I.C.E.

Although the gameplay of these two titles are similar, Shift recreates car handling much more realistically than ProStreet, and does not contain a story.

Killing monsters usually increases the player's fame while killing good characters (for example merchants) decreases the player's fame. Enough character points are needed to enter certain villages.<br/><br/>The world<br/>The game takes place in a world of five lands spread out over three continents. There are four types of land: plain, forest, mountains and desert. Enemies become more dangerous in different types of land, with plains being the safest terrain to cross. The continents are separated by oceans and storming sea around the last continent. A ship is required to sail the oceans. A special ship is needed to cross the storming sea but it can only be helmed by someone with pirate blood in his veins.<br/><br/>Throughout the world are several towns. Towns have smiths, who can repair armor, and healers that can heal and sell herbs. Shops sell weapons and some towns provide information while one person per village buys fangs for fifty guilders each.<br/><br/>There are also villages, which serve special purposes, such as selling ships or special magical items.<br/><br/>Several caves exist in the world. They house guardians that protect the mystical armors of legend. Throughout the world are also monuments, statues of Iason, which show the path to Terarin's lair or house a lair underneath them.<br/><br/>Finally there are also various castles. These can be visited to get the weapons of legends if the kings are impressed enough by your valor.<br/>&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Miracle_Warriors,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74431": {"rpgdesigner": ["J.

Human published the game by themselves in Japan whereas Nintendo did it overseas. It was released in Japan in 1991 and in the United States on May 1992. The game consists of exhibition games and tournament games. In exhibition, one can choose to play either a game or a shootout. In tournament mode, one plays until one beats all other teams. At the end of the tournament, the player must play one final team, Nintendo. When the tournament has been won, the player receives a code to play the game in a more advanced mode.<br/><br/>Originally, Formation Soccer was a PC Engine native game that was released around the time of the 1990 FIFA World Cup. The series was then carried over to Super Nintendo and, ultimately, to Nintendo 64.<br/><br/>The game is innovative because of its viewing perspective, to this day unique in soccer video games: the field is shown plainly on a vertical view, and the opposite goal can be seen from anywhere in the field, making use of the Mode 7 chip. This feature, however, is exclusive of the Super Nintendo games in the series.<br/><br/>At the opening screen, players can choose to compete in penalty kicks without playing an actual game.

There are 24 playable international teams, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Argentina, France, Spain, England, Brazil, Poland, Uruguay, Hungary, USSR, Sweden, Czechoslovakia, Cameroon, Ireland, Japan, Korea, USA, Mexico, Australia, Scotland, Colombia and Yugoslavia. Before the game, the player can choose the formation of their team as well as number of overall attributes, including offense and defense, as well as luck. Unlike other similar games at the time, Hyper Soccer featured more advanced moves such as bicycle kicks, flying headers and volleys. The game features a scrolling view of the pitch and 2-Dimensional sprites for the players, one of two background midi tracks can be chosen to play during the match.

Two players can alternate as each progresses through the levels of the 1-player game, or they may go head-to-head in a number of race tracks.<br/><br/>Story<br/>The excess of the industrial revolution was doomed to haunt the earth. As the 20th century faded into the 21st, the planet's largest economies were focused on the service industry. Over population and few environmental quality regulations created an exodus of traditional industry to less developed nations. Fueled with cheap labor, factories churned out consumer products with obsolete &quot;dirty&quot; machines purchased from the former industrial giants. Each year billions of metric tons of pollution were dumped into the biosphere. Global warming increased exponentially.<br/><br/>As the 21st century progresses the greenhouse effect began to take its ugly toll. The polar ice caps melted at an ever increasing rate. International tensions rose with the water level at a time when the world had never been better armed. The end of the cold war over a hundred years earlier saw huge arsenals of weapons capable of mass destruction. As coastal cities sank under the oceans, people demanded action. Politically the easiest solution was to point fingers and launch attacks against &quot;environmental terrorists.&quot; Between global warming and global warfare the earth was forever changed.<br/><br/>The start of the 22nd century saw a true new world order. Survivors of the devastation lived in city states. Technology sophisticated and jaded by years of war the people demanded a new sport for their new age....Battle Cars...technology...aggression...Battle Cars. Afforded the same popularity earlier cultures had given artists or pop musicians, Battle Car drivers are heroes. Their only rule is to win.<br/><br/>Vehicles<br/>The player can select from three vehicles at the start of the game in a variety of colors. Each vehicle handles the same, so the choice is a matter of personal preference. The player uses his chosen vehicle for the length of the game. The choices are a spiked vehicle, a hot rod, and a formula one-style race car.<br/><br/>The vehicles driven by the level bosses are more exotic and unavailable to play.<br/><br/>Vehicle Upgrades<br/>The player can upgrade his vehicle by spending cash earned by defeating enemies on cross-country circuits. Each category may be upgraded to level eight.<br/><br/>Engine: The base speed of your vehicle if turbo becomes deactivated. <br/>Turbo: Faster speed than engine power alone, but can become deactivated if you take many hits in a short period. You must then wait five seconds for it to recharge. <br/>Tires: Upgrading prevents skidding and provides better braking ability. <br/>Dampener: Keeps your car from bouncing off the walls. <br/>Jump: Allows you to jump over enemy cars and disks. <br/>Shocks: Reduces the bounce caused by jumping.<br/> Weapons<br/>The game features three weapons. These can be upgraded up to five levels, each increasing in speed and accuracy. Weapon upgrades are purchased using credits obtained from quickly completing Cross-Country races.<br/><br/>Disks: Fast-moving disks that slide along the track and ricochet off of the sides. Causes 1/3 damage to minor enemies. <br/>Missiles: Homing missiles that can go off-road. If a missile goes out of view, you will need to wait 10 seconds before you can fire again. Causes 1/3 damage to minor enemies. <br/>Grenades: Thrown a set distance in front of your vehicle. Difficult to aim, but will completely destroy minor enemies in one shot, often several at once.<br/><br/>Levels<br/>The main game features nine levels, each with two race tracks; one cross-country and one circuit.<br/><br/>Cross-Country: The player must first complete a Cross-Country track. These are linear courses in which the player must make it to the end of the course while destroying enemy cars to score cash. A countdown timer will be periodically displayed and if the player spends too much time on a cross-country track, he will be attacked repeatedly by the Peace-Net satellites scattered about the track.<br/><br/>Circuit: Upon successfully completing the level's Cross-Country race, the player is challenged by the level's boss racer to a circuit race. The race is for two laps, and while there are many enemy cars present, they are merely a foil to the human player as destroying them does not provide any cash rewards. To increase the challenge, the boss's vehicle cannot be destroyed, but can be slowed down with attacks.<br/><br/>The names of the levels and bosses are:<br/><br/>Newtroit: Metalhead Mike <br/>Katmandu: Dirty Knuckle Ned <br/>Meltdown: Doctor Diana <br/>Fuji: Maniacal Mariko <br/>Neuvo Vegas: Buffed Bachmed <br/>Dakar: Nomad Nathalmu <br/>The Zone: Medfly Max <br/>Cantauri IV: Fourarm Foxtherm <br/>New Atlantis:Foxwharmpit <br/>In addition, there are five circuit tracks and nine cross-country tracks in 2-player mode.<br/><br/>Level Descriptions<br/>Newtroit: Possibly a conjunction of &quot;New&quot; and &quot;Detroit.&quot; It is a large city with many factories. <br/>Katmandu: A country setting with desert, mountains and waterfalls. <br/>Meltdown: The remains of a power generating station that has seen better days.

Much of the planet surface is water, except for an archipelago near the raceway.

The game was directed by Hideo Kojima and made its worldwide release on June 12, 2008, ten years after the release of Metal Gear Solid and twenty years after the US release of Metal Gear.<br/><br/>Guns of the Patriots received widespread critical acclaim, garnering perfect reviews and Game of the Year awards from several major gaming publications, including GameSpot, which claimed that game is &quot;technically flawless&quot;. The game has been a financial driving force for Konami, helping the Metal Gear franchise reach 5 million units in the financial year of 2009.<br/><br/>In MGS4, players assume the role of Old Snake, utilizing stealth, CQC and traditional combat techniques. The overhead camera of earlier Metal Gear games has been replaced by a third person camera, with first-person view and over the shoulder cameras optional.<br/><br/>A further addition to gameplay mechanics is the Psyche Meter. Psyche is decreased by non-lethal attacks, and is influenced by battlefield psychology. Stressors (including temperature extremes, foul smells and being hunted by the enemy) increase Snake's stress gauge, eventually depleting his Psyche. Adverse effects include difficulty in aiming, more frequent back pain and the possibility of Snake passing out upon receiving damage. Among the available methods of restoring Psyche are eating, drinking, smoking and reading a magazine.<br/>Snake has a few gadgets to aid him in battle. The OctoCamo suit mimics the appearance and texture of any surface, decreasing the probability of Snake being noticed. The Solid Eye device highlights items and enemies, and can operate in a night vision and a binocular mode. It also offers a baseline map, which indicates the location of nearby units. The latter function is also performed by the Threat Ring, a visualization of Snake's senses that deforms based on nearby unit proximity and relays them to the player.<br/><br/>Metal Gear Mk.II, later substituted by Mk.III, offers codec functionality and a means to the in-game menu for a large part of Snake's mission. It can be remote controlled to stun enemies, provide reconnaissance and interact with the environment. Its design is based on the namesake robot from Snatcher, a game designed by Hideo Kojima.

The player takes on the role of a young adventurer who can have up to two sprites, creatures that perform tasks such as healing or long range attacks, following you at one time. There are five dungeons in the game: The Tower of Light, Ancient Ruins, the Ice Castle, Droog Volcano, and Platinum. You start out in the town of Arcs; there is only one other town, Toronto (not to be confused with the real city of Toronto, Ontario). In Toronto there is a battle arena in which the player can fight for money. The player can also bet on other competitors. The game features several kinds of weapons including bows, boomerangs, swords, axes, and flails. An aspect of the game that sets it apart from RPGs such as Final Fantasy is the main character's inability to gain experience or level up. Defeated enemies yield gold, not experience points. Throughout the game the player can acquire better armor and weapons to increase his defensive and offensive capabilities, similar to the Legend of Zelda series. The sprites that accompany the protagonist could level up by picking up blue 'XP' orbs that were dropped randomly by defeated enemies.<br/><br/>Story<br/>Remeer's father, the last of the dragon warriors, was sent on a quest to find the last of the dragons terrorizing the village.

Reviewers mainly noted that although the developers intended for the game to be strategy-based, most of the game saw players driving a tank through a linear level, from point A to point B. Thus, the game was deemed strategy lite. Reviewers also noted that the on-foot sections of the game were dull and repetitive, but luckily could normally be avoided. The multiplayer aspect of the game received mixed reviews. Most reviewers noted that the multiplayer game was more strategy heavy, because the games sub par artificial intelligence was replaced by a human opponent. Besides the core gameplay, the graphics were also criticized.

Believing it will solve the dilemma, he leads them to the deserts and kills himself. His body becomes two stones, light and dark, and he gives one to each boy to rule their own kingdoms respectively. The people of the lightstone form the kingdom of Androth, and the people of the Darkstone form Ka'dra'suul. But while Androth respects their stone, Ka'dra'suul reject theirs, and are eventually transformed into monsters by it. In this time, a ka'dra named Sarlac seizes power. He forms an army and leads them against Androth. Knowing of his people's doom, the ruler of Androth, King Vlaros, with the aid of the Androth magician Galadril, sends his son Kyle to Earth to save his life.

The player can then fly into the outline, and take on the form of the enemy robot, taking control of its weapons, agilities and special attacks.<br/><br/>There is also addition to the boss battle scoring: similar to some shooters, players have the opportunity to increase their scores by beating the end level bosses within a certain time limit. Every time a boss battle is initiated, a timer will count down and once the boss is destroyed/killed before the timer reaches zero, then the time left will add to the player's end-level score; if the timer runs out, then the score at the end of the level will remain unaffected. Extends/1 Ups were awarded every 300,000 points.<br/><br/>The Bio-Cyborgs<br/>Mars: A Bio-Cyborg armed with the three-way firing Mega Cannon and comes equipped with three Atomic Shields which are two-second long explosive rings that protect the cyborg from harm.<br/><br/>Grain Beat/Odyssey: A Bio-Cyborg armed only with the Funnel guns which can be arranged to fire in three different forward-firing positions.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade: The fastest of the Bio-Cyborgs which comes equipped with the Twin Cannon and the Dimension Field which makes the ship invincible for ten seconds.<br/><br/>Titan: A muscular Bio-Cyborg armed with the Slice Laser and comes equipped with unlimited homing missiles.<br/><br/>Neptune: A horned Bio-Cyborg armed with the Wide Lazer and is equipped with two Hyper-Bombs, a powerful blast that fires forward.<br/><br/>Baron: A winged Bio-Cyborg armed with the Sonic Gun and is equipped with unlimited Diffusing Bombs, a bomb that fires onto ground forces.<br/><br/>Hyper D: The slowest of the Bio-Cyborgs which comes equipped with the twin, diagonal firing Beam Gun and is equipped with unlimited Vertical Shields&rsquo;, a flare weapon that not only hurts enemies but also destroys most enemy shots.<br/><br/>Port Differences<br/>BlaZeon was ported fom the arcades to the Super Nintendo/Famicom. However, there were some significant differences between the two:<br/><br/>The animated opening from the original was completely removed from the console version. <br/>2 Player co-op was removed from the home console port, although an option to change the game's difficulty and ship color was included. <br/>Many enemies were cut from the home console version: in stage 3, the walker enemies were removed and placed only once in the final stage while some of the organic enemies in stage 4 were either removed or their AI was changed. <br/>Many parts of the battleship Guanols were cut in the SNES port including a transport carrying parts of the level boss. <br/>The design to the underground stage, Shurice, was redesigned in backgrounds, foregrounds and mini-bosses in the console port. The level was also originally the third level in the Arcade version, but switched to Stage 4 in the console port. <br/>The ending (which only showed the game's Credits) was removed entirely from the home console version; instead, players restart the game with the same score and lives they beat the game with on a higher difficulty. &quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;BlaZeon,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74455": {"rpgdesigner": ["Doug Click", "Andrew Ferguson", "Chris McFarlane", "Mark Plemmons"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version", "Soft Cover"], "poll": [], "name": "Player's Primer: A Guidebook to Tellene", "rpgartist": ["Keith DeCesare"], "rpgproducer": ["Brian Jelke", "Steve Johansson", "Jennifer Kenzer", "Mark Plemmons", "Clayton Van Sickle, III"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic760409.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "rpgsetting": ["Kingdoms of Kalamar"], "average": "8", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (3.5 Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Kenzer and Company"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Fantasy (Sword & Sorcery)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic760409_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the book:<br/>UNIQUE CHARACTER, UNIQUE VISION<br/>Welcome to Tellene!

The inhabitants of the city, guarded by a mighty Dragon, lived in peace and abundance. However, King Berebus, the ruler of Berimya, desired to expand his kingdom. He ordered the scholars to research the Tower.<br/><br/>Soon, one of the scholars brought a tome written in an ancient language from the tower to Berebus, which they started deciphering. As they were deciphering the tome, some scholars feared that they might be laying their hands on the forbidden knowledge of the ancients.<br/><br/>When the scholars decipher the tome, it read, &quot;The Great Guardian of Berimya, the Dragon, and the Essence of Power lies in the top of the Tower; the one who possesses the Essence will possess all.&quot; Undaunted by the otherwise ominous words of the tome, Berebus decided to make the Essence of Power his own.<br/><br/>He secretly organized an army, which soon seized the Tower and raised their swords against the Dragon. Even the Dragon could not resist the power of Berebus' army. As Berebus grasped at the Essence of Power, the Dragon gave up its own life to destroy the Essence of Power. The Essence, losing control, transformed the King into a hideous monster and sank the entire kingdom of Berimya, including the great tower, under the ground. All people on the surface of the earth forgot about Berimya and the Tower in its center, and a thousand years passed.<br/><br/>A mysterious swordsman, known as Varik, is pursued by a sorceress named Alexis (Dela Delon in Japan) who seeks revenge for the murder of her master.

Jack (the player) must avoid them or get arrested. When a group of Popper Police manage to bunch up on the player and halt his movement, a message will pop up with the words &quot;You are under arrest.&quot; This renders any further progress in the game impossible pending a cut scene. Depending on how many times the player has broken the law and whether he has nickels (coins) or not, the player will either get a lecture by Detective Frank Harris and/or be forced to pay bail money. 10 coins is the usual bail required by Detective Harris; bankrupting players who either haven't been to Las Vegas to increase their nickel stash or opened a Cool World bank account.<br/><br/>Buildings<br/>Near the center of Cool World, there is a bank (with an animated Bald Eagle) that allows the player to store nickels in a bank account.

Holli's doorbell has a tendency to spit out a fireball attack at a random moment causing a life to be instantly lost.<br/><br/>After withstanding anywhere between five to seven hits from a Doodle using any form of weapon except fire attacks, the player's character curls himself into a ball and turns into a tombstone with an R.I.P. epitaph on it.

They are business simulation games, presented in an isometric view in 2D with graphics by Simon Foster, in which the player is in control of a transport company, and can compete against rival companies to make as much profit as possible by transporting passengers and various goods by road, rail, sea or by air. The Deluxe version is an expanded and improved version of the original game.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>To start building a transport empire, the player must construct transport routes, consisting of stations near industries or towns, and in the case of trains or road vehicles, near physical routes. One transport route can utilize several different forms of transport, e.g. truck&rarr;ship&rarr;train. The player's company and the individual stations each have ratings that depend largely on their efficiency at moving goods from one stations to the other. A station with high ratings may attract more goods.<br/><br/>The game begins in 1930 (1950 in TTD), and ends in 2050. The player starts out by borrowing money to finance construction of transport facilities, and is charged interest until the loan is repaid. As the user plays the game and earns revenues, they have the choice of expanding service along existing routes, or expanding their transportation network. The game features a progression of technology: in any particular year of the game generally only contemporary types of technology are available. For example, railroad signals which allow more than one train to use a section of track are initially semaphores. Later they are replaced by red and green traffic-light signals. Similarly, in the beginning there are only steam engines, but later diesel and electric engines are introduced. In the game year 1999, monorails become available. These require a separate track system from railroads. If the player remains in business until 2050, the game announces that they have won, allows them to post their name on the &quot;hall of fame&quot; and then continues. At this point, the year stays 2050 and never goes any higher, although the game can continue indefinitely. Playing the entire 120-year campaign takes about 40 hours. The game allows the player to save at any time, and multiple saves of a particular game at any point are possible.<br/><br/>Vehicles in the game must be constructed at corresponding depots, which must be connected to the road or rail networks. Towns and cities have their own road networks, but extra roads may be needed to connect them to other towns, or to various resources.<br/><br/>The player earns revenue by picking up resources or passengers at a certain station, and delivering them to another station where there is a demand for them. Demand is determined by the area which surrounds the station; for example stations close to towns will demand passengers. The revenues will depend on the delivery time, distance, and quantity delivered. The influence of these factors on revenue varies according to the type of goods being delivered. For example, mail will rapidly fall in value, meaning that it can only be delivered profitably over short distances, or over long distances very fast. On the other hand coal loses value very slowly, so it can be transported in bulk over long distances whilst remaining profitable.<br/><br/>At times, subsidies are offered to the first company to move a particular resource from one place to another. This encourages the player to create a larger more complex transport network, rather than focusing on previously profitable routes.<br/><br/>The game features a system of Local Authority. Each city has a rating for every transport company based on the impact of their transport network. When the rating falls too low, the player will no longer be able to demolish buildings or construct new stations. The rating depends on, among others, the level of service and the deforestation caused by the company.<br/><br/>In the course of a game cities develop and expand according to various economic factors, and new industries (demand) or other resource sites (supply) may appear. Some natural resources may also eventually be exhausted and industries without adequate transport service may shut down. Also, new models of vehicles are introduced and eventually come to replace older models. At introduction such a new model will likely have improved characteristics, but may suffer from reliability issues.<br/><br/>The game was initially published by MicroProse. It can still be found for purchase as a budget title, but may not be compatible with modern operating systems. Transport Tycoon works with Windows 95, and can be run on other OS's from DOSBox). A fan-made game engine recreation OpenTTD is also available.<br/><br/>Locomotion<br/>Further information: Chris Sawyer's Locomotion<br/>After the success of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, Chris Sawyer turned his attention towards a sequel, but during development he changed his mind and produced RollerCoaster Tycoon, which turned out to be a runaway hit. After RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 was done, work on the third version was left to another development team, and Sawyer returned to work on his Transport Tycoon sequel, Chris Sawyer's Locomotion. It was released in September 2004 and was described by Sawyer as the &quot;spiritual successor to Transport Tycoon&quot;, but received poor reviews and was not a commercial success. Despite this there is an active Chris Sawyer's Locomotion community who continue to produce modifications.<br/><br/>Music<br/>The music in Transport Tycoon was originally composed by John Broomhall, from 1994 to 1995.[clarification needed] It features old-style blues and jazz tunes including parts of Herbie Hancock's Cantaloupe Island. The music is presented in MIDI, and stored with the file extension &quot;.gm&quot;.<br/><br/>Third party updates<br/>Several development teams are currently working to improve Transport Tycoon. TTDPatch provides gameplay enhancements and numerous bugfixes to TTD by patching the original binary. OpenTTD is an open source complete recreation of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, achieved by reverse engineering the original game, and delivers many bug fixes and general enhancements to the game, like making it possible to run TTD on multiple platforms, including Mac, Linux and PSP. While both games allow new graphic sets for vehicles and terrain to be used, at present, TTDPatch still requires the original TTD graphics, sounds, binary and music files to run. OpenTTD does not need any of the TTD files to run as it has free graphics and sounds, however it can still use the original TTD graphics and sounds.<br/><br/>&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Transport_tycoon,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74468": {"poll": [], "name": "Kingdom Under Fire: Circle of Doom", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["IT XBox 360 Release", "NA Xbox 360 Release"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic763311.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Kingdom Under Fire"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "13", "videogamedeveloper": ["Blueside Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Action RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Xbox 360"], "average": "4.57692", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Microsoft Game Studios"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic763311_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Kingdom Under Fire: Circle of Doom is an Action RPG video game developed by Blueside and published by Microsoft Game Studios exclusively for the Xbox 360. It is the fourth installment in the Kingdom Under Fire series and the first released for the seventh generation of consoles. Chronologically the game's story follows Kingdom Under Fire: The Crusaders released in 2004 and its prequel Kingdom Under Fire: Heroes released in 2005. It was first released in Australia  on December 5, 2007, followed by Japan on December 13, 2007 then later in North America on January 8, 2008 and in Europe on February 1, 2008.<br/><br/>Unlike the previous Kingdom Under Fire games in the series, Circle of Doom's gameplay is significantly different, with the real-time strategy elements completely absent, with much of the gameplay focus being on the role-playing and hack and slash combat aspect.<br/><br/>Unlike the previous instalments in the Kingdom Under Fire series, Circle of Doom is entirely a hack and slash role-play, much is the vein of dungeon crawlers and focuses entirely on the player&rsquo;s chosen character out of five (sixth can be unlocked), thus lacking the real-time strategy formula of the previous games. Given the single character focus, much of the gameplay revolves around close quarter combat with multiple AI controlled opponents throughout each level. As the player progresses with each kill, they gain experience that eventually leads to gaining a level, the maximum being level 120. Each time the player levels up they receive a given number of experience points to boost their overall health, skill points and luck.  Higher-level players will also be able to wield better weapons and armour and allow more options for magic use. Levels are also generated at random, with differing paths and amount of foes between each (while foes are still confined to certain areas) and destructible environments with the use of heavier weapons.<br/><br/>While the player has a standard health bar, the skill points forms another (SP bar) that when the player performs an attack or uses magic, their SP becomes depleted and recovers when nothing is performed, so the player will be unable to attack if there isn&rsquo;t enough SP at that moment of use. The more SP and the faster rate it can recover allow longer chains of attacks. The Luck skill determines the quantity and quality of loot and gold dropped by slain foes. The Luck skill can also help in the game&rsquo;s &quot;synthesis&quot; system, one which lets players pay gold combine items to improve one, for example combing a powerful weapon with a weaker one will result in its overall attack power being somewhere in between, with enchantments from both also present. Luck improves the chances of a successful synthesis along with a larger investment of gold.<br/><br/>Items can also be bought and sold when the player encounters an Idol in each level that serves as buyers and sellers of various items. There are three different Idols in total; Death, Love and Greed who excel more in certain items than others who appear at certain times of the in game&rsquo;s &quot;moon phases&quot;. The Idol also provides a safe sanctuary where foes cannot enter, thus allowing players to &quot;sleep&quot;. When the player sleeps, they appear in the dream world where they interact with other characters who progress the story by providing quests, insight and allowing players to learn new skills, most usually requiring a certain number of particular foes to be killed. Magic and weapons can assigned to 4 commands buttons on the Xbox 360 controller at any given time, X and A buttons for use of weapons/attack and B and the right trigger for use of magic. Potions that can quickly boost health and SP or cure magic affects inflicted by enemies can be applied to the left and right bumper buttons. The player also has Accessory slots where armour and stat increasing jewellery are applied for effect, more being available for purchase from Idols. The game features three difficulty levels; Normal, Hard and Extreme that differ between the strength of foes, but however only Normal can be played to begin with and the other difficulties are unlocked by completing Normal (then Hard for Extreme mode) and are only playable with the character that unlocked them.<br/><br/>Circle of Doom also allows up to four players to play through each level and corresponding boss fights over Xbox Live.This can allow joining players to play through levels they have yet to progress to as long as the host has. Players that receive items and experience online will still reap the benefit for their character offline at the same time, thus allowing players to trade items and complete quests with others but foes toughness increases the more players there are. The Xbox Live headset is also supported for use.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Kingdom_Under_Fire:_Circle_of_Doom,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74469": {"poll": [], "name": "Heimdall 2", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["International (PAL) Amiga CD32 Release", "International Amiga 500/600 Release", "International Amiga1200 Release", "International PC-DOS 3.5\" Disk Release", "International PC-DOS CD-ROM Release"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic757915.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Heimdall"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy", "Mythology", "Viking / Norse"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["The 8th Day"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "DOS"], "average": "7", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Core Design"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic757915_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Heimdall 2 (also known as Heimdall 2: Into the Hall of Worlds) is an isometric action-adventure video game developed by The 8th Day and published by Core Design for Amiga, Amiga CD32 and MS-DOS platforms in 1994.

The title was downloadable over the Nintendo Power peripheral in Japan and was also released as a demo onto the Nintendo Super System in 1991. F-Zero is the first game of the F-Zero series and was one of the two launch titles for the SNES in Japan, but was accompanied by additional initial titles in North America and Europe. In late 2006, F-Zero became available for the Virtual Console service on the Wii.<br/><br/>Players control fast hovering craft and use their speed-boosting abilities to navigate through the courses as quickly as possible. The game takes place in the year 2560, where multi-billionaires with lethargic lifestyles created a new form of entertainment based on the Formula One races called &quot;F-Zero&quot;.<br/><br/>F-Zero is acknowledged by critics to be the game that set a standard for the racing genre and the creation of the futuristic sub-genre. Critics lauded F-Zero for its fast and challenging gameplay, variety of tracks, and extensive use of the graphical mode called &quot;Mode 7&quot;. This graphics-rendering technique was an innovative technological achievement at the time that made racing games more realistic, the first of which was F-Zero. As a result, the title reinvigorated the genre and inspired the future creation of numerous racing games. In retrospective reviews of the game critics agreed that it should have used a multiplayer mode.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>F-Zero is a futuristic racing game where pilots race inside plasma-powered hovercars in an intergalactic Grand Prix at speeds exceeding 500 km/h. There are four F-Zero characters that have their own selectable vehicle along with its unique performance abilities. The objective of the game is to beat opponents to the finish line while avoiding hazards such as land mines, slip zones and magnets that pull the vehicle off-center in an effort to make the player damage their vehicle or fall completely off the track. Each machine has a power meter, which serves as a measurement of the machine's durability; it decreases when the machine collides with the side of the track or another vehicle. A race in F-Zero consists of five laps around the track. The player must complete each lap in a successively higher place to avoid disqualification from the race. For each lap completed, the player is rewarded with an approximate four-second speed boost called the &quot;Super Jet&quot; and a number of points determined by place. An on-screen display will be shaded green to indicate that a boost can be used, however the player is limited to saving up to three at a time. If a certain amount of points are accumulated, an extra &quot;spare machine&quot; is acquired that gives the player another chance to retry the course. F-Zero includes two modes of play. In the Grand Prix mode, the player chooses a league and races against other vehicles through each track in that league while avoiding disqualification. The Practice mode allows the player to practice seven of the courses from the Grand Prix mode.<br/><br/>Leagues<br/>F-Zero has a total of fifteen tracks divided into three leagues: Knight, Queen, and King. Difficulty is determined by the league selected and difficulty level chosen. The game has three initial difficulty levels: beginner, standard, and expert. The master difficulty level is available for a given league once that league on the expert class is completed. The multiple courses of Death Wind, Port Town, and Red Canyon have a pathway that is not accessible unless the player is on another iteration of those tracks, which then in turn closes the path previously available. Unlike most F-Zero games, there are three iterations of Mute City that shows it in either a day, evening, or night setting. In BS F-Zero 2, Mute City IV continued the theme with an early morning setting.<br/><br/>Story<br/>F-Zero is set in the year 2560, when humanity's multiple encounters with alien life forms had resulted in the expansion of Earth's social framework. This led to commercial, technological and cultural interchanges between planets. The multi-billionaires who earned their wealth through intergalactic trade were mainly satisfied with their lifestyles, although most coveted more entertainment in their lives. This resulted in a new entertainment based on the Formula-1 races to be founded with vehicles that could hover one foot above the track. These Grand Prix races were soon named &quot;F-Zero&quot; after a rise in popularity of the races. The game introduced the first set of F-Zero racers: Captain Falcon, Dr. Stewart, Pico, and Samurai Goroh. IGN claimed Captain Falcon &quot;was thrust into the limelight&quot; in this game since he was the &quot;star character&quot;. An eight-page comic was included in its SNES manual that carried the reader through one of Captain Falcon's bounty missions.<br/><br/>Development and audio<br/>A merger between Nintendo's various internal research and development teams led to the creation of Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development (Nintendo EAD), which was headed by Shigeru Miyamoto. F-Zero was one of the launch titles for the SNES that Nintendo EAD had approximately fifteen months to develop completely. The game was produced by Shigeru Miyamoto and directed and designed by Kazunobu Shimizu. Takaya Imamura, an art director for the game, was surprised to be able to so freely design F-Zero's characters and courses as he wanted since it was his first game.<br/><br/>Notable in the development of F-Zero was its use of Mode 7 graphics. Mode 7 is a form of texture mapping available on the SNES which allows a raster graphical plane to be rotated and scaled freely, simulating 3D environments without processing any polygons. The Mode 7 rendering applied in F-Zero consists of a single-layer which is scaled and rotated around the vehicle. This pseudo-3D capability of the SNES was designed to be represented by both F-Zero and Pilotwings, with 1UP.com stating these two games &quot;existed almost entirely for the sake of showing them off&quot;.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;F-Zero_(video_game),&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74478": {"rpgdesigner": ["John A.

A sequel to the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) arcade game, it is a scrolling beat 'em up based on the 1987 TMNT animated series. Originally an arcade game, Turtles in Time was ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV: Turtles in Time in 1992. That same year, a similar game, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Hyperstone Heist was released for Sega Mega Drive/Genesis.<br/><br/>Years later, the arcade version of Turtles in Time was revisited on newer consoles. A slightly altered version of the arcade game was included as an unlockable bonus in the 2005 game Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3: Mutant Nightmare. In August 2009, Ubisoft released a 3D remake of the game, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time Re-Shelled, for Xbox Live Arcade.The remake was released onto PlayStation Network on September 10, 2009.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Up to four players (two players in the SNES version) can take control of Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo, and Raphael. Each playable character has his own strengths and weaknesses. New features in this game include the ability to execute a power attack by hitting an enemy several times in a row, and the ability to slam Foot Soldiers into surrounding enemies or to throw them out of the playing field, towards the camera.<br/><br/>The game features the same control scheme of the previous arcade release a joystick for movement, an attack button and a jump button. Certain joystick/button combinations can make a Turtle run, perform a slide or dash attack, jump higher, perform a stationary or directed air attack, or perform a special attack.<br/><br/>Players guide the turtles through a series of levels, starting out in the streets of New York City before being transported to levels representing various eras of history. In each level, players face enemies from the 1987 cartoon, including foot soldiers and stone warriors.<br/><br/>Plot<br/>Shredder taunts the Turtles after Krang steals the Statue of Liberty, in the intro of the arcade game.The introductory cut scene of the game details the game's plot. It begins with the Turtles watching a TV newscast on a Sunday evening, with April O'Neil reporting from Liberty Island. Suddenly, Krang flies in using a giant exosuit (seen occasionally in the animated series) and steals the Statue of Liberty, moments before Shredder hijacks the airwaves to laugh at the Turtles. The Turtles jump into action in downtown New York and pursue the Foot to the streets and the city sewers (then to the Technodrome in the SNES version), where Shredder sends them through a time warp. The Turtles must fight Shredder's army in both the past and the future in order to get home.<br/><br/>Development<br/>The original music of the game's soundtrack was composed by Mutsuhiko Izumi a TMNT veteran who also composed the music for the previous arcade game in the series. It was produced by Kazuhiko Uehara and Harumi Ueko, both of whom went on to produce several Konami games, including the following TMNT game, Tournament Fighters. In addition to an original musical score, the attract mode of the arcade game is noted for featuring the song &quot;Pizza Power&quot;, which was taken from the TMNT live concert known as the Coming Out of Their Shells Tour. The game's music was released as part of the compilation album Konami All-Stars 1993 ~ Music Station of Dreams, published by King Records in 1992.<br/><br/>The 2005 version of the game included in Mutant Nightmare features new music and voices, updated to match the new TMNT series. The same would apply to Turtles In Time: Re-Shelled.<br/><br/>Super NES<br/>The Super NES version was retitled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV: Turtles in Time in North America in order to tie it to the first three Ninja Turtles games for the NES. Like the NES version of the first arcade game, the SNES version of Turtles in Time is not a direct port of the arcade original, as it did present some notable differences in presentation and gameplay.<br/><br/>While the SNES version is missing some animations and graphics effects from the arcade version, it features a Mode 7 forward scrolling effect in the &quot;Neon Night-Riders&quot; level and unique skin tones for each turtle. The SNES version is also missing certain voice samples for both the turtles and boss characters. In addition, the arcade version's title theme song, &quot;Pizza Power&quot;, was replaced with an instrumental version of the cartoon theme song.<br/><br/>The second part of the SNES-exclusive &quot;Technodrome: Let's Kick Shell!&quot; level, features a fight sequence in an elevator.Various alterations were made to the SNES version's gameplay. &quot;Sewer Surfin'&quot; and &quot;Neon Night-Riders&quot;, were changed to bonus levels and a new technodrome stage was added. Four new bosses were also added: Slash, who replaced Cement Man, the Rat King, Battletank Shredder, and the duo of Bebop and Rocksteady. The game also replaces the final boss with Super Shredder from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze (who previously appeared in the NES game Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project). The SNES version also adds two regular enemies: Roadkill Rodneys (which replaced the boxing robots) and Mousers. The game also features a time-trial mode, and a two-player versus fight mode. Each turtle was given unique attributes in areas such as speed and strength. In addition, the throw and slam moves can now be performed intentionally, instead of just randomly.<br/><br/>Re-Shelled<br/>The 2009 remake, Re-Shelled, features new graphics and sounds. The graphics were remade completely in 3D, with players now moving in and out of a true 3D camera. The opening and closing cinematics were remade with a stylized 2D look. The vocal quips of the arcade version return, re-recorded by the cast of the 2003 cartoon.<br/><br/>Re-Shelled is based on the original arcade machine rather than the SNES version, meaning that the extra stages and enemy characters from the earlier home version are not included. The gameplay remains similar, except that players can now attack in eight directions. The game can also be played online with up to 4 players. This version also features a Survival mode, Quickplay mode, multiple difficulties and achievements/trophy support.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles:_Turtles_in_Time,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74480": {"rpgartist": ["P.

Each turtle has his own strengths and weaknesses. Donatello has a long range of attack, but attacks slowly, Raphael's attack is fast but has a very short range, and Leonardo and Michelangelo are well-balanced.

The bosses of the game are the standard villains: Bebop, Rocksteady, Baxter Stockman, General Traag, Granitor, Krang, Shredder and Super Shredder, though just like Fall of the Foot Clan, Krang serves as the final boss.

Michelangelo can hover using his nunchakus as a helicopter, Leonardo can drill the floor by spinning with his katana, Raphael can hide himself inside his shell to enter passages that are otherwise too small to enter, and Donatello can stick to and climb walls.<br/><br/>The bosses are Scratch, Dirtbag, a Triceraton, Scale Tale, and Shredder (in this game known as Cyber-Shredder).<br/>&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_III:_Radical_Rescue,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74491": {"poll": [], "name": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Mega Drive edition", "English/European NES edition", "English/European SNES edition", "Japanese Mega Drive edition", "Japanese Super Famicom edition", "North American Genesis edition", "North American NES edition", "North American SNES edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic901430.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon"], "videogamefranchise": ["Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Konami"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["NES", "SEGA Genesis", "SNES"], "usersrated": "23", "average": "5.56522", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Konami"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic901430_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters, or Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles: Tournament Fighters in Europe, is the title of three different fighting games based on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise, produced by Valve for the Nintendo Entertainment System, Genesis, and Super NES and released during a period between 1993 and 1994. Konami produced a different fighting game based on the series for each platform, featuring their unique gameplay and cast of characters.<br/><br/>Nintendo Entertainment System version<br/>The NES version of Tournament Fighters was the final game Konami released for the platform in North America and PAL region in 1994. Unlike the other versions of Tournament Fighters, it was not released in Japan. Tournament Fighters was one of the few fighting games released for the NES during the fighting game boom.<br/><br/>The game's single-player Story mode has the player taking control of one of the four turtles (Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello), as they hold a contest amongst themselves to see who is fit to take on Shredder's challenge. After defeating the first four opponents (including a clone of the player's character), the player proceeds to fight Casey Jones and then Hothead (a character based on the Dragon Warrior from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures comics) before the final match with the Shredder. In addition to the Story mode, the game also has two Versus modes (one against the CPU and another against a second player), as well as a four-player tournament mode. An option mode where the player can adjust the game's difficulty, continues, and speed is also available.<br/><br/>The gameplay follows many of the standard fighting game conventions. Battles consist of three-round matches and the first player to win two rounds is the victor. Each character has their own repertoir of basic punch and kick techniques, as well as command-based special moves. During battle, a flying capsule with Splinter will sometime appear that will drop a fireball power-up at the middle of the stage that can be retrieved by either fighter. Whoever retrieves the fireball power-up will be able to use it by inputting the appropriate command.<br/><br/>The NES version allows the player to match any character against a clone of himself, with the exception of Hothead. The game doesn't allow such a match under normal circumstances, but there's a way to bypass this restriction in the game's &quot;Vs. CPU&quot; mode. The second Hothead will be colored differently, as with all same character matches in the game, but the game will also flicker due to the large size of both characters.<br/><br/>Super NES version<br/>A tournament has been organized and many fighters have entered, Shredder being one of them. The turtles decide to participate in order to stop their nemesis as well as proving their strength in the tournament.<br/><br/>This game's controls uses a four-button scheme (two punches and two kicks, weak and strong). A particular feature is the possibility to use a super special attack. In order to achieve this, the player must fill a green bar under the life bar, by hitting their opponents. Once full, the player must press the two strong attack buttons simultaneously. There is also the option of enhancing the speed of the game, making the fights more intense but also harder to follow.<br/><br/>In addition to the main and versus modes, there is a story mode in which the turtles must rescue April O'Neil and Splinter. Only the four of them can be playable whereas the other characters (as well as a turtle clone) are the opponents. There is also a watch mode, which basically makes the computer control the characters.<br/><br/>There are ten characters available, and two bosses. Aside from the turtles and Shredder (who goes under the name of Cyber Shredder in this game), these characters are also available:<br/><br/>War - A monstrous purple creature with big claws, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures comics published by Archie. The game version of the character is said to be an alien. <br/>Aska - A ninja girl seeking to open her own dojo. Aska is an original character who makes her first and only appearance in the franchise. <br/>Wingnut - A humanoid, alien bat who appeared in several issues of the Archie Comics series, as well as in an episode of the animated series. <br/>Chrome Dome - An android from the animated series, he was initially created by Shredder to destroy the turtles. <br/>Armaggon - A mutant shark from the future. Also from the Archie Comics series. <br/>The bosses are:<br/><br/>Rat King - A deranged man who cast away his humanity and considers himself a rat even though he has not been mutated. The character in the game is based on the cartoon version <br/>Karai - The female leader of the Foot Clan in Japan. She only appeared in the original comics by Mirage Studios at the time of the game's release.<br/><br/>Genesis version<br/>The Genesis version uses the standard three-button controller, with only two buttons for attacking (punch and kick). To perform stronger punches or kicks, the player must simply hold the directional pad towards the opponent while pressing either attack buttons. The third button is used for taunting. Some of the stages in the game feature destroyable scenery that gives the player and their opponent access to new areas in the stage.<br/><br/>The game has eight playable characters, which includes the four Turtles and Casey Jones, as well as April O'Neil (who differs from the cartoon version of the character featured in other versions), Ray Fillet (a character from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures comics), and Sisyphus (a new character, named Musha Beetle in the Japanese version). The player can adjust their power and speed after selecting their character.<br/><br/>The main &quot;1-Player&quot; mode features the turtles and their allies traveling to various planets in Dimension X, fighting against clones of themselves, as they seek to rescue Splinter from Krang. After defeating the eight clones, the player travel to the final three stages to fight against a Triceraton, Krang's Android, and Karai (in that order). The game has a 2-Players mode, as well as a &quot;Practice&quot; mode in which the player faces the computer in a 1-round match, and a &quot;Tournament&quot; where the player must defeat 88 opponents with one life gauge.<br/><br/>&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles:_Tournament_Fighters,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74493": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1062878.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ted Alspach"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Ted Alspach"], "boardgamepublisher": ["B\u00e9zier Games, Inc."], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1062878_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Trains", "Transportation"], "description": "This are two full size, full color mounted maps that fold to a size that fits in both the Steam and Age of Steam boxes. At first glance, both have similar rules changes: an option to forsake delivery of goods cubes or an increase of locomotive and replace it with a special function that will be key to winning the game. But the differences between the maps and how they are played are substantial.<br/><br/>California Gold Rush takes place in the mid 1800&rsquo;s in Central California. Pockets of gold have been found, and you need to lay claim to the mines before your opponents. To do so you need to build railroads out to the gold mines and pick up the gold. The mechanics are modified slightly during the delivery phase: you always have the option of picking up any available gold cube wherever your track has been laid instead of delivering a regular good cube or increasing your locomotive. At the end of the game, each of the gold cubes increases your income (VPs in Steam) by 5. California Gold Rush is for 3-6 players.<br/><br/>Underground Railroad takes place in the years leading up to the civil war all across the Eastern United States. During the goods delivery phase, players may opt to move slaves north to a free city instead of delivering a goods cube or increasing their locomotive. They don&rsquo;t receive any income for doing so. The winner is determined by who frees the most slaves...as long as they don&rsquo;t go bankrupt before the end of the game.  Underground Railroad is for 3-5 players.<br/><br/>The 2010 Essen Aos/Steam map pack from Bezier Games features 7 new maps, including 6 mounted ones on 3 double-sided expansions.
