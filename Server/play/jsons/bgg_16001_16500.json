The deck is dealt out face down evenly among the players. Cards depict Power Rangers, bad guys, or puzzle pieces. Each player simultaneously turns over their top card and the player with the highest value card wins them all. If there's a tie, the tying players continue turning over cards one at a time until someone turns over a higher value card. The player that wins the trick takes all point cards and places them in a separate pile (to be counted up later). Then the winner collects all puzzle cards and puts them in the center of the table either starting or adding to a puzzle. There are 2 six-piece puzzles: one depicting a Megazord, and one depicting Rita Repulsa. The game ends when either puzzle is completed. If the Megazord puzzle is completed, the point values on Power Ranger cards are added up. If the Rita Repulsa puzzle is completed, the point values on bad guy cards are added up. The player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>"}, "16386": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Reise durch die Schweiz", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1953", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Switzerland"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1711423_t.jpg", "average": "4", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Otto Maier Verlag"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1711423.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["German edition 1956", "Multilingual 'Weber Shops' edition 1953", "Multilingual edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Transportation", "Travel"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The game is a round trip through Switzerland, departing from and returning to Z&uuml;rich.

PLAYERS WATCH THEIR STOCKS FALL, RISE, CRASH and SKYROCKET . . . RIGHT BEFORE THEIR EYES! For added excitement, players also Mine for Gold and participate in a Gold Rush!  The &quot;Game Play&quot; in Stock Rush is so unique and diverse that it spans many game categories including: Strategy, Family, Party, Simulation, Educational, Action and Adventure!<br/>  <br/>For 2 to 10 Players, Ages 8 and up.<br/><br/>DETAILED SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Game play begins on The Opening Bell space and a peg is used to keep track of the trading day.  Players can play a regular game and spend a full business week on Wall Street [Mon-Fri] or they can play a shorter game by starting on Wednesday.  The game usually ends when the trading day peg reaches &ldquo;Game Over&rdquo; which is the slot after Friday.  Other ways the game can end are: &ldquo;Market Collapse&rdquo; in which all companies go bankrupt; One player left in the game after all the other players go bankrupt and All players are trapped in a Cave In.  At the end of the game, all players liquidate [sell] their holdings to the bank and the player with the most cash wins the game.<br/><br/>STOCKS . . .<br/><br/>Players buy and sell [Trade] stocks at the current market price shown by the &quot;Market Display&quot; [4 Stocks comprise the market in the game, A,B,C and D]. The stock prices are affected by news and rumors that randomly occur throughout the course of the game. There are two types of news and rumors that occur: Market News and Rumors affect the entire market; and Company News and Rumors which only affect a given individual company. Although rumors occur at random; how long they remain alive can be strategically predicted. The longer a rumor remains alive the higher the chance it will be confirmed or dispelled on the next turn. Consequently, players must trade accordingly; they must decide on 4 Criteria: [1] Buy or Sell?; [2]Which Stock to Trade?; [3] How many Shares to Trade?; and most importantly [4] When to Trade?.<br/><br/>COMMODITIES [MAINLY GOLD] . . .<br/><br/>The Stock Rush name was inspired by the California Gold Rush of 1849. As a result, a significant portion of the game is dedicated to that historical event. Players randomly mine for Gold and participate in many Gold Rushes throughout the game. During a &ldquo;Gold Rush&rdquo; players may become trapped in a &ldquo;Cave In&rdquo;.  Trapped players may escape on their own or be rescued by other players.  <br/>Once players accumulate Gold they may strategically sell any amount they wish on the &quot;Gold Exchange Market&quot;. They must sell according to 3 Criteria:<br/>[1] How much Gold to Sell? [2] At What Price to Sell? [3] When to Sell?  The other commodities in the game are Groceries, Toys, Clothes and Gear&hellip;the STUFF we use in our everyday life.<br/><br/>"}, "16397": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Casdon Football", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Simultaneous Action Selection"], "yearpublished": "1966", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Football / Soccer"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1180317_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Casdon", "Harbert"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1180317.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Casdon English First Edition", "Casdon English Second Edition", "Harbert French Edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Sports"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Hands on soccer much like the &quot;bubble&quot; hockey games of today where two players face off in a match of dexterity and control while moving the soccer ball down the field.<br/><br/>"}, "16398": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic104062.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Division War", "TacDex: Halo", "TacDex: Pirates", "TacDex: The Walking Dead", "A War of Suits"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamecompilation": ["Kidz Cardz 4 Favorite Card Games"], "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Jim Davis"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Public Domain)", "Autogrill", "Cardinal", "Children's Television Workshop", "Fundex", "Golden", "Grimaud", "Hallmark Games", "Hasbro", "Hoyle Products", "International Games", "La Poste", "Max Hamburgerrestauranger AB", "Milton Bradley", "School Specialty Publishing", "Stancraft Products", "The United States Playing Card Company", "University Games", "Western Publishing Company"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic104062_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Children's Game"], "description": "War can be played with a standard 52 card deck as well as special themed decks of different sizes.<br/><br/>The deck is dealt out evenly to the players into face down piles.

Later campaigns saw the Japanese-Allied struggle for the Indian Frontier, the deployment of the Chindits, and the final Japanese grasp during the Imphal campaign, followed by the Allied counter-attack that won victory in the theater.<br/><br/>CBI is intended to be a simple game: it allows for the completion of the entire four year campaign within 16 turns.

Players conduct operations with their units in their own turns.

Each airstrike represents one or two British wings, US groups or Japanese air regiments.<br/><br/>The game includes three scenarios. Scenario 1, &quot;Singapore to Calcutta&quot; is the campaign game, 1941 - 1945 (16 turns). Scenario 2 covers the last Japanese offensive in Southeast Asia: &quot;Imphal&quot;.

The two dealers want to store spices so that they know where everything is, but they also have to keep the rats at bay.  Stack your crates, keep your spices together, and cover up the rats.<br/><br/><br/>Rat Hot is a two-player game developed from Michael Schacht's Dschunke: Das Legespiel on his own label Spiel aus Timbuktu, which in turn was developed from his game Dschunke, also published by Queen. The Rat Hot tile distribution differs slightly from Dschunke: das Legespiel but you can very nearly use the Dschunke: das Legespiel rules with a Rat Hot set.<br/><br/>All the games use the clever mechanism of stacking long 3x1 tiles so that the upper tiles obscure some parts of the tiles underneath. In Rat Hot, the two players simply take turns to draw 2 tiles from a face down pile, and add them to the existing layout.<br/><br/>The tiles are all 1x3 and show a combination of rats, spices or empty crates. Each player has four different types of spice in their player colour which they are trying to form into large groups. Many of the tiles have spices of both colours.<br/><br/>The game is scored with grey and yellow chips which represent 1 and 2 points. Each time you place a tile, you and your opponent can score points from groups created or changed by that tile. Whenever a group of two of the same spice is formed, the owning player receives one point, or two points for groups of three or more. Beware! If there are three rats of your own colour visible at the end of your turn, you instantly lose.<br/><br/>When the draw pile is exhausted and the tiles all placed, the board is scored once more for all players, so trying to preserve existing groups also counts.<br/><br/>The real trick in the game comes in the tile placement. Tiles must be adjacent by at least one square. Tiles can placed on top of other tiles, so that stacks build up. But a tile can not sit exactly on top of another, so there must always be some offset, and all three squares of a tile must be supported by other tiles, or the table.<br/><br/>Rat Hot can be very tricky. You want to keep your opponent's rats exposed in awkward places, so they have to spend both their moves trying to keep the rats covered. But you also want to set up scoring positions, and cover your own rats, and avoid giving your opponent points as well. There's a good mental challenge here, as you puzzle over the best use and arrangement of your tiles. Do you dare leave two of your rats open, because your opponent may draw more of your rats and make it impossible for you to finish your next turn with less than three showing. Can you get a good group of spices going and also break up your opponent's groups? Tricky problems for tricky minds.<br/><br/>Rat Hot is a quick, fun game and is a good addition to Queen's line of small 2-player games. The wood chips make it easy to see who is leading, the tiles are nicely made, the graphics are fun, and the game plays quickly and fairly. You can be stuffed by unlucky tile draws, but perhaps your low score is more to do with your choices, or maybe the other player is just smarter than you. Fast play, easy rules, and the risk of sudden death give Rat Hot a high replay value.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["EN/FR/ES/DE edition", "German edition", "Hungarian edition", "Print and Play Edition", "Queen multi-lingual edition"], "average": "6.32645", "name": "Rat Hot", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Building", "Tile Placement"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "943", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games", "Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Rats"]}, "16498": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic90090.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Harald Lieske"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2005", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Harald Lieske"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Queen Games"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic90090_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Exploration"], "description": "A Queen game by Harald Lieske.

Jails can only hold 5 outlaws at any one time, and each outlaw has a &quot;strength&quot; rating.<br/><br/>On your turn, you can either place an outlaw from your hand into an empty slot in your jail or into someone else's jail.  The outlaws each have &quot;power&quot; ratings.  An outlaw can be sent to replace a weaker outlaw in someone else's jail.<br/><br/>You can defend your jail.  If someone sends an outlaw to your jail, you can eliminate him with one of your outlaws - but you have to send your defender to someone else's jail.  That person can defend against you, of course, so each turn has the possibility of generating a chain reaction that involves multiple players around the table.<br/><br/>It's a lighthearted social game with a solid core of strategy. Higher value cards tend to be weaker, and sets (or &quot;gangs&quot;) are worth much more than singletons.  Everyone at the table can see what's in your jail, so as you gain the advantage you also acquire a bullseye.

Roll and move effect is mitigated in a number of ways - players can re-roll once in each turn and they can collect helping cards when arriving on specific spaces or rolling a pentagram. The four quests are as follows:<br/>- Library: find the book that opens a secret door to the secret passage. For this, find the same-colored book as the spaces you arrive on.<br/>- Maze: to find your way through the maze, move the 5 moving pentagon tiles showing parts of the maze. These can be moved (turned or moved to different spaces) when rolling a pentagram or when arriving on a pentagon space. Cards might also help.<br/>- Suspended bridge: each step (space) has some hidden traps that are revealed when stepping on them, easily causing players fall into the abyss. Some of them can be avoided with knowledge (knowing which blue owl has which number on its bottom), others with planning and luck (e.g. tiles where you fall into the abyss if you arrived there with specified die rolls), others with discarding a card. If a player falls into the abyss they have to climb back to the bridge and try again. The task gets easier once tiles are revealed and players know what to expect.<br/>- The Five Owls: owls have to be placed on the five numbered spaces in order (the owl with number 1 to space 1 and so on). If a player fails they go back to the entrance of the owls hall. The numbers on the bottom of the owls can be looked at during game (with cards or when rolling a pentagram) but whenever they are checked (secretly, by the active player) they are placed back to another space so their location keeps changing and players must watch their movement closely during the course of the game.<br/>The first player to correctly place the fifth owl to its corresponding place on the last space of the path wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["'Das Spiel zum Kinofilm' Edition", "First edition"], "age": "7", "name": "Bibi Blocksberg und das Geheimnis der blauen Eulen!", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Memory", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "average": "4.75", "usersrated": "8", "boardgamefamily": ["Characters: Bibi Blocksberg"]}, "16129": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Trivial Pursuit: Pocket Player Set \u2013 TP's People", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1987", "usersrated": "14", "boardgamefamily": ["Trivial Pursuit"], "maxplayers": "12", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic104874_t.jpg", "average": "4.42857", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Horn Abbot Ltd.", "Parker Brothers", "Playmix", "Selchow & Righter"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic104874.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["French edition", "Selchow & Righter US edition 1987"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Party Game", "Trivia"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "(From the box:) Trivial Pursuit Pocket Player Sets let you play a great new way - anywhere, without a board!

Each word card has 4 different words on it along with either a positive sign ( + ) or a negative sign ( - ). Words are articles, nouns, verbs, adjectives or adverbs. Different symbols correspond to the different parts of speech.<br/><br/>Everyone is dealt 10 cards face down (your personal pile) and players then draw 3 of those cards to form a hand. Remaining cards form a draw pile. On your turn, you may start a headline with a noun or article card, add a card to your headline (following normal sentence structure), add a card to someone else's headline (if you have a headline of your own started) or pass (and draw a card from the draw pile). If you use a card from your hand, you draw a card from your personal pile. Headlines must start with a noun or article and must contain at least 2 nouns and 1 verb. The headline is completed and set aside when the second noun is placed.<br/><br/>The round continues until a player runs out of cards from both their personal pile and their hand. Each player then scores their completed headlines. Incomplete headlines do not score any points. Subtract the number of negative cards from the number of positive cards in the headline. If the result is positive, this is your score. If the result is negative, take the absolute value as your score (e.g. you get 4 points for a score of -4).<br/><br/>The first player to reach a score of 10 wins the game.

According to what the avatar at the oracle had said, Urrick would be here, and he would be unbeatable without the aid of a spell caster.  That is why, as a sinister form began to take shape within the eldritch mists of the portal, Twoelk&rsquo;s trepidation grew.

They could now discern the immense stature of the Rakshasa as it stepped through the vapors.  It was Urrick.<br/><br/>As the tiger-man&rsquo;s pale eyes narrowed on the two adventurers, he sneered.  He would enjoy eviscerating these foolish humans, and dining upon their entrails.  But before he could pounce upon his victims, an unseen force left him suspended in mid-leap.  It seemed the Twoelk and Alyta were equally stunned.  &ldquo;Now, my friends!  Strike now!&rdquo;  It was the voice of Brannig, whom they believed had been killed in the ruins south of the oracle.

It was designed as a celebration of golf, the 'Royal and Ancient' game that was hugely popular with affluent 'bright young things' whose world is reflected in novels by Evelyn Waugh, Nancy Mitford and P.G. Wodehouse<br/><br/>Play begins once each player has selected a colour counter and the order of play has been decided. Each player takes it in turn to place his counter on the starting point and flip it once towards Flag 1. When it is his turn again, the player flips his counter towards the first 'hole' from wherever it is on the board after his previous attempt. To complete the 'hole', a player's countermust come to rest on the white circle of a flag, but is not necessary for it to cover the whole of the space. When a player's counter touches the white circle and completes a 'hole' it can be flipped agian towards the next flag. The winner is the first player to reach Flag 16, the final 'hole' of the Golf Tiddlywinks course.<br/><br/>A counter that comes to rest on an opponent's counter must go back three 'holes'. Counters that land in a bunker or lake are returned to the start, from where the player must try to reach the Flag that was his goal before he encountered the hazard. Counters that leave the board entirely are returned to the start, from where, after missing a turn, the player must try to reach the Flag that was previously his goal.<br/><br/>For up to 4 players aged 3 years and over<br/>Not suitable for children under 36 months due to small parts.<br/><br/>Original game courtest of Richad Ballam antique games archive<br/><br/>"}, "16264": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Club Golf", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Simulation"], "yearpublished": "1995", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Golf"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1221012_t.jpg", "average": "4.4", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Gibsons Games", "WHSmith"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1221012.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Gibsons English First Edition", "WHSmith English Second Edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Sports"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Standard rules for 2, 3 or 4 players.

While creating, one attribute is more important than the rest, one that is seldom ascribed to adult monsters: beauty. This is definitely a matter of taste - and that's why the typical ideals of beauty don't count in this modeling competition - instead, they're ones that young players love.

For the final battle, you roll three dice to attack King Sphinx. If all players have defeated all the Space Aliens, a Megazord is built allowing players to roll four dice in the final battle. The first player to defeat King Sphinx wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition", "MB Jeux French Edition", "MB spellen Dutch spellen 1994", "MB spiele German Edition"], "name": "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Game", "playingtime": "30", "average": "4.23913", "usersrated": "23", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Children's Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["TV Series: Power Rangers"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 29: Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"]}, "16381": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Audio Game", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "1994", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Audio Cassette Board Games", "TV Series: Power Rangers"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2415730_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Children's Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2415730.jpg", "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamepublisher": ["Parker Brothers"], "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Children's Game", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "age": "4", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "This is actually 2 games that use an audio cassette to direct the game play.

The tape will tell you when to draw cards and when to battle. The object is to cover your Heroes with their Power Ranger counterpart cards. A Rita Repulsa card may be played on an opponent to make him or her lose a turn. A Putty card is immediately discarded (thus wasting a draw). A Space Alien card may be placed on an opponents Power Ranger card forcing that player to play another Ranger card on that space. A Megazord card defeats a Space Alien and/or prevents further attacks on that space.

This results in real chaos and soon the first parts will be falling to the ground. Try to keep your eye on your strategy to get the highest score. Limited edition of 150 pieces, numbered and signed by the author.<br/><br/>Each player gets four little plots on the back of the game-box. Depending on the number of empty plots, a player gets material at the beginning of his turn. Now he can use this material to build connections between his plots. There are different building-styles which are more or less difficult and therefore result in more or less points. A player can also use the already built parts of the other player, which is easier and therefore results in less points. If you manage to build very complicated connections, you'll get more points. After a while, the board will be full of chaotically arranged bridges. If something falls, you'll get penalty, so be careful! Once all plots are connected, the game is over and if you didn't plan carefully you again get a penalty.<br/><br/>"}}
