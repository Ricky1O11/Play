The goal of the development was to create an aesthetically attractive area in which large companies could perform their R&amp;D with physical and political privacy. Though the original tenants were diverse, large pharmaceutical firms eventually dominated the region pushing out all commerce that did not support their functioning. These firms still stand, though most have branched out into related fields such as genetic engineering and mega-agriculture. The ever-looming influence of the Bible Belt plus <br/>good old Southern tradition prevented 'artificial' life technologies such as cybernetics or electronic subdermal implants from taking root in favor of more 'natural' or 'organic' methods. Attaching a bionic arm may be a social faux pas, but regrowing one using 'all-natural' and 'locally produced' pharmaceuticals (actually synthesized from various non-native plant and animal species raised in a lab or greenhouse) seems perfectly fine around these parts. In fact, it's quite amazing what folks will accept as &ldquo;natural&rdquo; sometimes.<br/><br/>ENVIRONMENT<br/>Residents of the Triangle take great pride in what they call their 'pristine wildernesses.' Most of the time these supposed 'preservations' are in fact built around megacorp headquarters or universities, both as a display of influence and a buffer against spies, protesters and the government. Stray too far and you will soon end up in what's now simply called the Interior &ndash; the former cities of Raleigh, Durham, Cary, Morrisville, Carrboro and Chapel Hill. This sprawling mass of haphazard urban <br/>planning houses most of the middle and lower class populations and service industries. While not terribly dirty, the Interior is vastly overcrowded and unpleasant to view since much of the original natural beauty was transplanted for 'protection.'<br/><br/>SOCIETY<br/>The relative affluence of the Triangle during the difficult economic times of the early 21st century attracted a wide variety of emigrants from across wildly different cultures and backgrounds. Unfortunately, some of these cultures did not mesh well together and racial tensions reignited, further aggravated by a new structure of ethnic social stratification. Well-educated immigrants from East Asia &ndash; particularly Chinese and Indian &ndash; took the lion's share of the high-paying technical pharmaceutical work. The &ldquo;native&rdquo; population, most of which had some combination of Caucasian, African and Hispanic heritage, failed to catch up to the rapidly progressing technology and were largely relegated to unskilled labor. Reaction to the Asian immigration influx created 'purist' groups among each of the various &quot;native&quot; ethnicities. The purist groups tend to be small due to the difficulty of proving single-ethnic heritage but the few that exist can be vicious.<br/><br/>"}, "145531": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Richard Borg", "Konstantin Krivenko"], "poll": [], "name": "Samurai Battles: Ninja Attack", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2013", "boardgameexpansion": ["Samurai Battles"], "usersrated": "24", "boardgamefamily": ["Art of Tactic", "Commands & Colors", "Country: Japan", "Samurai"], "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1725660_t.jpg", "average": "7.9375", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Zvezda"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1725660.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Wargame"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Bodyguards rattled their weapons on the other side of the wall as the Shogun mumbled something in his sleep.

The alliances of the world&rsquo;s major nations seemed to change every moment. The American Armed Forces needed to devise plans for any number of possible sudden conflicts. Scenarios were written based on current equipment, technology, and strategy. The Washington treaty of 1922 that limited the tonnage of ships for the major navies never happened. The military&rsquo;s solution was WAR PLAN.<br/><br/>War Plan: Orange was the code name given to the Navy&rsquo;s scenarios dealing with a threat from Japan. Plan Orange was constantly modified as new ships, aircraft, technology, and strategies were improved. Equipment available to both sides at this time would have been fascinating to see in use, as is the focus of this game.<br/><br/>This will be the first of a series of &ldquo;War Plan&rdquo; games from Historical Board Gaming. This boxed game will come complete with all components needed to play. Fight the intense battles between the Japanese and American Navies during the early 1930&rsquo;s that never were. Utilizing fantasy ships like the Lexington Class battle-cruiser as designed before it was converted to an aircraft carrier, and the Colorado class Battleship that was scrapped before building, the American forces will take on Japanese ships like the Tosa, Amagi, Kii, and No. 13 Class Battleships as well as the infamous 3-flight deck versions of Kaga and Akagi. These beautiful ships, as well as aircraft and airships, will be represented in this game with actual plastic ships, planes, and airships based on designs from pre World War II. With pieces that match the scale of other famous games in the genre, fight the Plan Orange scenarios and then add them together with other games to make your own!

Each game will take 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the quest and the style you play.<br/><br/>The core game comes with ~10 quests, each with different goals and unique rules. Do you ruthlessly hack and slash, killing all demons in the Pilgrims' path? Or take a more virtuous path, cleansing the demons' souls, saving villagers and collecting good karma. Your decisions affect the Pilgrims' abilities, skills and equipment. Killing demons may be quick but can you risk accumulating that bad karma? Side quests may enhance your Pilgrims' skill and karma, but with more demons spawning, can you afford to spend that time?<br/><br/>Solo play is almost identical to multi-player games. Instead of multiple players controlling 1 or 2 pilgrims each, 1 player will control all four Pilgrims. There are no other changes to the game whatsoever!<br/><br/>Many games have science fiction or fantasy settings, but Chinese mythology is a rich and beautiful environment that is under represented in games. This setting gives Journey a large pool of art, architecture, mythology, and drama to draw upon. The striking map tiles, tokens, cards and highly detailed miniatures capture the Pilgrims and their world perfectly. But the themes run much deeper - skills, weapons, harmful conditions, custom dice and the Karma game mechanic stay true to the environment, fully immersing the players in the game world.<br/><br/>This is only the start of the Pilgrims' journey.

Two-to-four players are pitted against one another as one of the four main powers on the Western Front.  You will command both common and specialist troops from the armies of Britain and France or Germany and Austro-Hungary, including soldiers distinctly unique to each.<br/><br/>Every play-through will be different.  Hazards are deployed before the start of each match, including barbed wire and craters.  The mechanics for every weapon is distinctly different.  The Maxim and Vickers guns will chew an arc across the board.  Snipers will pick off single targets daring or foolish enough to step up to the edge of their trench.  Riflemen will make their slow, bolt-action attacks or grapple in melee combat with bayonets and hand-to-hand weapons until one comes out the survivor.<br/><br/>Combat outcomes, be they melee or ranged, will be decided with alterable randomness.  The default chances to hit are decided between the unit&rsquo;s skill and cards drawn from the deck.  Each player is dealt a new hand of cards at the start of each of the eight turns.  First the attacker has the opportunity to influence an event where the random card drawn is not in their favor.  The player can choose the card best suited from their hand to turn it in their favor.  In return, the defender can then counter, if they so choose, with a better suited card they choose from their own hand.  This influencing with cards can go back and forth until one player runs out of cards or decides they have expended enough.  It will be a bloody day along the trench.  Will it be that of your soldiers or the enemy&rsquo;s?<br/><br/>Adding to the replay potential are the missions that players will be issued to complete.  Players could be tasked to capture and hold locations in the dangerous No Man&rsquo;s Land, to make hazardous excursions to retrieve pilots and the film from downed biplanes, or even going Over the Top to seize the enemy&rsquo;s trench.  Each of these missions, and others, change the nature of the experience.  The tactics to cover a sortie to a biplane won&rsquo;t work to invade the enemy&rsquo;s trench.  How to place machine guns for maximum effect, when and where to bombard the enemy with poison gas, and where to drive a charge of riflemen towards are all in the player&rsquo;s power.  Wise tactics will mean the difference between success and yet another bloodbath.  It will take more than firepower to live through the day.  Each commander will need cunning, thoughtfulness, and a patience to time their attacks and defenses to best effect.<br/><br/>"}, "145601": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3420271.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Dan Schnake", "Adam West"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2017", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Tom Babbey", "Peter Gifford", "Glen Orbik"], "boardgamepublisher": ["CrossCut Games", "WizKids"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3420271_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Murder/Mystery"], "description": "New York, the city that never sleeps.

That said, the game differs in a number of ways from Mr. Jack. In more detail...<br/><br/>In Le Fant&ocirc;me de l&rsquo;Op&eacute;ra, eight suspect tokens stand in the ten rooms of the Op&eacute;ra Garnier. Each suspect has a reason to drive the opera singer La Carlotta away from the production, and at the start of the game one of the suspects is randomly determined to be the true identity of the Phantom player. The other player is the Investigator, and he wants to discover the Phantom's identity; if he does so before La Carlotta flees the Op&eacute;ra Garnier, then he wins. Otherwise, he loses. (To balance play between newcomers and experienced players La Carlotta's starting position can changed.)<br/><br/>At the start of each odd round, eight suspect cards are shuffled and four of them revealed. The Investigator moves one suspect and (likely) uses this suspect's unique ability, then the Phantom moves two of the remaining three suspects, then the Investigator moves the final suspect. The Phantom player then reveals whether he can or cannot cause a disturbance in the Op&eacute;ra Garnier, thus scaring La Carlotta; he can cause a disturbance only if he's alone or if he's in the room with the blackout token. If he can cause a disturbance, the Investigator clears all suspects sharing a lit room; if not, the Investigator clears all suspects in the dark or on their own. After this, La Carlotta moves one step closer to fleeing for each suspect that hasn't been declared innocent (and an additional step if the Phantom did create a disturbance).<br/><br/>For each even round, the remaining four suspect cards are revealed, and the players again move characters and use their special abilities, with the Phantom going first. The game continues until only a single suspect is not innocent or La Carlotta flees France for the safety of Milan.<br/><br/>When a character moves, it can move up to as many spaces as the number of characters in the room from which it moves. Most characters can move only through open corridors, but Meg Giry can use secret passageways that connect many of the rooms. The players must use Meg's ability and the other characters' special abilities to hide or reveal information. One character, for example, moves a padlock that blocks one corridor, while another is responsible for the roaming blackout that allows the Phantom to operate in darkness (or at least provide cover for his activity elsewhere). One sweet character can draw everyone from adjacent rooms to her side, while an unpleasant fellow can drive everyone away. Still another reveals (or hides) an alibi card, clearing one suspect (or keeping his true nature unknown). Every character is useful in the right situation.

In the game, the players take on the roles of commanding forces on opposite sides of the conflict.<br/><br/>One player leads the extraterrestrial conquerors whose goal is to transform the Earth and subjugate its inhabitants. The Invaders possess unthinkable weapons and unknowable technologies. More so, within their galactic armada the aliens hold bound a terrifying array of eldritch creatures engineered specifically to sow the chaos and destruction that heralds the arrival of their masters.<br/><br/>The other player commands the unyielding forces of a united Earth. In the shadow of a planet-wide scourge, the nations of the Earth have joined forces to confront the arrival of a doom spawned on the other side of the galaxy. The Terran alliance is a desperation-forged bulwark upon which the invading forces crash and are repelled time and again. Outgunned, with salvaged or untested technology and one foot in the grave, the determined network of military machinery, elite strike-teams, warfare scientists, and neighborhood militias are surprisingly capable of bloodying the Invaders' noses whenever the two forces meet.<br/><br/>The eponymous Invaders seek to destroy the forces defending the Earth and exhaust their reserves. They do this by defeating the defending forces at key locations while also causing the Earth player to disrupt cards from their deck to their discard pile. The Invader must be cunning when deploying their creatures and war-machines, or enacting their schemes, as the cost to bring assets into the war often involves the discarding of other assets.<br/><br/>Mankind must work desperately to defend critical resources and locations from the corruption and incursion of the alien threat. They do this by building formidable and deadly defenses, predicting where the alien player will strike and setting traps designed to deprive the Invaders of key units and wear-down their options. Like the Invader, the humans need to be clever in what they deploy and how they deploy it because their heroes may be bold but they are small in number, and the Invaders are inexorable.<br/><br/>Invaders is a science-fiction game piled thick with the trappings of war and horror. It is steeped in difficult decisions, but built upon a simple, elegant set of rules, and because of this, you will find each game telling a slightly different story each time you play. Both sides use cards to represent their units, plans, resources and events, but as this is an asymmetrical battle game, the way in which those cards are played and how they forward their owner's goals are very different. Regardless, knowing when to let an asset go in favor of a better one, how to exploit a weakness in your enemy's ranks, and where to press an advantage or feint a trap will be key in seeing your side emerge as the victor from the morass of galactic war.<br/><br/>One question remains: Which side are YOU on?<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual first edition"], "average": "6.96227", "name": "Invaders", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["Invaders: Armageddon"], "usersrated": "238", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Aliens"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 4: Shogun with Tenno's Court, Gremlins, and Faster Than Light", "The Game Pit: Episode 15.2 - Council Chamber Essen Review", "The Game Pit: Episode 17 - The Bumper End of Year Review", "The Game Pit: Episode 27 - Top Ten from 2013"]}, "145655": {"rpgartist": ["Jacob Blackmon"], "rpg": ["ICONS"], "poll": [], "name": "Badwater Knight", "rpgdesigner": ["Daniel Gallant", "Steve Kenson", "Mike Lafferty", "Mike Mendoza"], "rpgproducer": ["Dan Houser", "Ade Smith"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1727179.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Fainting Goat Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Justice Wheels"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1727179_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Justice Wheels #21  features Badwater Knight, a modern day Templar Knight who fights the forces of the supernatural from the back of an airboat in the Louisiana Bayou.

With Cuttin&rsquo; Down the Nets all of the action comes from each team&rsquo;s rating sheet.<br/><br/>Let me stress that this is NOT a quick play game. All action is resolved possession-by-possession, just as in real basketball. With the simplified method, you are tracking only the team&rsquo;s score and fouls which allows for quicker game times. However, you&rsquo;ll still visually see why a team wins or loses. With Cuttin&rsquo; Down the Nets each team&rsquo;s card is formulated to accurately replicate all aspects of a team&rsquo;s play. Each team is rated offensively for field goal percentage, three point shooting, propensity to commit turnovers, ability to get open shots, propensity to commit offensive fouls, free throw shooting, offensive rebounding, and ability to hit contested shots. On the defensive side, each team is rated for their ability to contest shots, propensity to commit fouls, ability to force turnovers, defensive rebounding ability, and two point and three point field goal percentage allowed.<br/><br/>Cuttin&rsquo; Down the Nets also features a unique Power System that incorporates strength of schedule as well as home court advantage. With the Power System you can accurately match-up power house teams against the cupcakes and be assured that the results will mirror real life.<br/><br/>The advanced game features all of the above, but also brings individual players into the mix. Every player for every team is accurately rated to perform as they did in the college basketball season. Cuttin&rsquo; Down the Nets features a unique system that doesn&rsquo;t require manual substitutions on the part of the gamer. This system means that you don&rsquo;t have to track player minutes or other minutia for realistic performances. With Cuttin&rsquo; Down the Nets every player will perform as they did during the college season. You&rsquo;ll have nights where your starters are &ldquo;off&rdquo; and nights where a bench player provides a spark, leading your team to victory.<br/><br/>And while the substitutions are handled within the game engine, don&rsquo;t think that coaching decisions were left out. As the coach, you decide when to implement the full-court press. You&rsquo;ll decide when to &ldquo;sag&rdquo; to stop the opponent&rsquo;s inside game or stretch your defense to pressure the perimeter shooters. On offense you decide the pace in which your team plays. Do you fast break, or use the entire clock to limit the opponent&rsquo;s possessions? Best of all, each coaching option is just that, and option. If you have designs on being the next great college coach, you can implement them all.

The rest of the players play Hero&rsquo;s foes, fight a round of combat, and then the next player plays his Hero. Hence, only one player is playing a Hero at a time while the rest play his foes. If a player is playing Hero&rsquo;s foes, their Hero is currently inactive and doesn&rsquo;t factor into play. The Hero wins renown points by defeating his enemies. There are various victory conditions (the first player to reach 40 renown, the last player with a surviving Hero, or the last player with cards left to play wins the game).<br/><br/>Each player starts with one Hero card, a foe deck and a draw deck. Players randomly decide who will go first. That player becomes the active player, and places his Hero card in the center of the table and is considered to be playing the Hero. All players then draw cards form their draw deck and play begins. The Hero player then can place into play any allies and locations that he or she might have and also place items and weapons on his Hero card for use them in the upcoming combat. Whether or not cards can be placed into play depends on several factors, but the main mechanic for both foes and the Hero is their pool of prowess points. Most cards have a prowess cost that gets subtracted from this pool in order to place a card into play.<br/><br/>Then the foes draw from their foe deck a number of cards partly based upon how many much renown the Hero has. For every foe the Hero kills, that player places that foes card into the area known as the chronicle. Each foe has a renown score, and the total of all the felled&rsquo; foes renown score in Conan&rsquo;s chronicle is his renown score.<br/><br/>The more defeated foes in a Hero's chronicle, the more foes the opposing player gets to put into play, i.e. the more famous the Hero gets, the more enemies want to take him down. Once the foe pool is drawn, the foe players then decide which of these foe cards they want to put into play. There are major and minor foes and rules governing how many foes from the foe draw can be put into play. Once the foes decide which of their foe cards they are able and want to play, they place their foe cards into 4 zones around the Hero(front, left, right and rear). They then place &ldquo;move&rdquo; cards from their draw deck for each foe they have assigned to do battle with the Hero. These cards are placed face down and represent both offensive and defensive elements. The Hero player then responds to these move cards with his own move cards, placed face up, to counter each foes&rsquo; move card. Hero&rsquo;s move cards also incorporate both offensive and defensive elements. The foes then reveal their move cards and combat is resolved. If any of the foes are left alive, all players draw cards from their draw deck, and the surviving foes place new move cards onto the table. The Hero once again counters, combat is resolved, etc. until either the Hero retreats or defeats all his foes. If the Hero retreats he loses renown.

Each level has a game board filled with differently colored candies, and might contain obstacles. The basic move of this game is horizontally or vertically swapping the positions of two adjacent candies, to create sets of three (or more) candies of the same color.<br/><br/>This game is separated into levels, and each level has its own requirements to complete. The Facebook version of Candy Crush Saga currently has 440 levels, and a new set of levels is released approximately every 3 weeks. The smartphone versions of Candy Crush Saga currently have 395 levels.<br/><br/>The player is given a default maximum number of five lives. The player needs at least one life to play a level. If the player fails to complete a level, a life is deducted. Lives will regenerate at a rate of one life every 30 minutes. The player can also restore lives by asking Facebook friends for help, or by paying Facebook credits.<br/><br/>Special Candies are created when four or more candies of the same color are matched together. Special Candies have special effects (e.g. clearing an entire row of candies) when they are cleared. Examples of Special Candies include Striped Candies and Wrapped Candies.<br/><br/>If a player tries to swap two adjacent Special Candies, it will generally create a special combination effect. These effects are often more powerful than the individual candies' effects.<br/><br/>Obstacles appear in some of the levels. Obstacles have a wide variety of properties, and they are all designed to make it more difficult to complete a level. Examples of obstacles include chocolate that tries to slowly fill the entire game board, and tornadoes that randomly destroy spaces on the game board.<br/><br/>A booster is a single-use device that is costly (purchased) and can be used to help the player complete a level. Boosters are usually bought with Facebook credits. Every level in Candy Crush Saga can be completed without the use of boosters, but the game difficulty ramp is designed to encourage the purchase of boosters. Examples of boosters include a Lollipop Hammer that can destroy any game square, and a Free Switch that can swap any two adjacent candies.<br/><br/>In previous versions of Candy Crush Saga, a player could purchase charm items to help them complete a level. Charms were much more expensive than boosters, because charms could be used repeatedly.

Each citadel was ruled by a mighty master who marched their armies to battle for control over the vast magical pools known as Esper. The Esper imbued their great civilisations with magic, miracles and power. Decade after decade the violence and bloodshed escalated and the increasingly desperate masters performed cursed rituals to gain the advantage. Successive masters and their courts performed dark blood magic and offered tainted Esper to the gods of the cosmos.<br/><br/>Then one night at the sign of the Dread Moon a meteor crashed into the realm and obliterated nearly all life. The Esper turned into fiery Embers which cursed and twisted the lands and its inhabitants beyond imagination. Now nothing remains. Vile Phantoms, deformed creatures and shadows stalk the few remaining survivors.<br/><br/>It has been another 900 years since that fateful impact. The old masters have suddenly been bought back to life having been reanimated by the cursed Embers. They are but mere shadows of their former selves. Their only memory being the wars, anger and hate for each other. Both masters seek to resurrect their long lost champions, drain the lands of its few remaining resources.  Their quest is to rebuild their fallen citadels, summon elemental servants and raise Warbands from the dead. You are the master of the citadel! War will come again.<br/><br/>The goal of Master of the Citadel (MotC) is to create powerful Warbands capable of laying siege to your opponents citadel gates and destroying their city. You begin the game with a champion who you must advance into a powerful character capable of defeating powerful creatures summoned from beyond the spirit realm. Victory in these battles will reward you with the resources you need to scavange legendary weapons and armour, summon elemental servants to do your bidding, develop your citadel and construct deadly warbands.<br/><br/>MotC uses a unique battle system in which your champion summons the spirits of fallen enemies to fight in deadly combat. By performing a cursed ritual you set the difficulty of the encounter and the rewards you get scale accordingly. Victory may yield fate cards that provide hidden bonuses.<br/><br/>Summon elemental servants to boost your champions equipment when needed using MotC&rsquo;s unique flexible battle system.<br/><br/>Build paths, activate mysterious obelisks, explore abandoned keeps and harvest resources such as wood, stone, gold and cursed embers. <br/> Map tiles are colour coordinated and randomised meaning the available resources and strategic locations vary with each game.<br/><br/>Use your citadel board to enchant your champions' equipment. Build warband training grounds, citadel buildings and manage your resource pool.<br/><br/>Accumulate vast resources to build dreaded Warbands of wretched knights, dark mages and undead rangers. Use these warbands to fortify strategic locations, build mines, scout for stat boosting relics.<br/><br/>Then once your powers are at it's peak you are ready to siege and destroy your opponent.<br/><br/>"}, "145700": {"poll": [], "name": "Rock 'N Tour", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1846301_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1846301.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Spanish edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Music", "Trivia"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Rock 'N Tour it's a trivia game where you can explore more than six decades of Rock and Pop music in the best trivia in spanish language.<br/>Remember bands, classic songs, significant moments in rock history and discover the truth over facts and myths around the rock world.<br/><br/>Contains:<br/><br/>1 Board<br/>306 Trivia Cards (with over 1,400 questions)<br/>2 Tuckboxes<br/>8 Concert Ticket Tokens<br/>18 Musician Tokens<br/>1 Die<br/>4 &quot;Rock On&quot; Pawns<br/>1 Rulebook<br/><br/>"}, "145701": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Raphaela Platzer"], "poll": [], "name": "Musik Quiz", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Was ist Was", "Was ist Was Quizblock"], "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2099374_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Tessloff"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2099374.png", "boardgameversion": ["Tessloff Edition 2010"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Book", "Music", "Trivia"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Trivia block with 120 questions and answers about Musik where quickest correct answers score You a points.<br/><br/>Player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>"}, "145702": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Lisa Maurer"], "poll": [], "name": "Das alte Rom Quiz", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Ancient Rome", "Was ist Was", "Was ist Was Quizblock"], "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2472359_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Tessloff"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2472359.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Tessloff Edition 2009"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Ancient", "Book", "Trivia"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Trivia block with 120 questions and answers about Ancient Roma where quickest correct answers score You a points.<br/><br/>Player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>"}, "145703": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Lisa Maurer"], "poll": [], "name": "Dinosaurier Quiz", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Dinosaurs", "Was ist Was", "Was ist Was Quizblock"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Tessloff"], "boardgameversion": ["Tessloff Edition 2009"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Book", "Trivia"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Trivia block with 120 questions and answers about Dinosaurs where quickest correct answers score You a points.<br/><br/>Player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>"}, "145704": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Lisa Maurer"], "poll": [], "name": "Stadt Land Fluss: Deutschland Quiz", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Germany", "Was ist Was", "Was ist Was Quizblock"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Tessloff"], "boardgameversion": ["Tessloff Edition 2009"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Book", "Trivia"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Trivia block with 120 questions and answers about German where quickest correct answers score You a points.<br/><br/>Player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>"}, "145705": {"poll": [], "name": "Tequila Zombies 2", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Web Browser edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Tequila Zombies"], "videogametheme": ["Zombies"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamecharacter": ["Jacqueline Madeira", "Miguel Tequila"], "videogamedeveloper": ["IriySoft"], "videogamegenre": ["Scrolling", "Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Web Browser"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Kongregate"], "vgcharacterversion": ["Jacqueline Madeira", "Miguel Tequila"], "description": " User Summary <br/><br/>The sequel to highly original &quot;Tequila Zombies&quot; features endless waves of hungry, flesh eating zombies, an array of guns, power-ups, lots of tequila and an all new, alluring female character who joins Miguel.

You won&rsquo;t find pansy elves, drunken dwarves, or cutesy halflings or gnomes in these rules. Rather, here you&rsquo;ll find hulking brutes of men throttling the unholy life from demons with their bare hands, voluptuous pirate women slicing foes to ribbons with rapiers as razor sharp as their wits, dark wizards who become just a little less human with every spell they cast, and monsters from the darkest bowels of Hell and beyond. This isn&rsquo;t Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter. This is Conan and Lankhmar. In fact, the original source for these rules was a wonderful game put out by TSR in the 1980&rsquo;s, written by Dave &ldquo;Zeb&rdquo; Cook and based upon the Conan licensed property. That game endeavored to capture the feel of not only Howard&rsquo;s original stories, but the Conan comic books that were so popular at the time. It did its job well, and in the process gave us a game that was well ahead of its time, and very underappreciated. These &ldquo;obfuscated&rdquo; rules are an effort to put that system, sans anyone&rsquo;s intellectual properties, back out there for people to use and enjoy. We hope you enjoy playing it as much as we&rsquo;ve enjoyed putting it together.

Take charge of the US or Soviet space agencies - your duty is be the first to the moon. Carefully manage your budget by opening programs, spending R&amp;D funds on improving the hardware, recruiting personnel and launching space missions in this realistic turn based strategy game.<br/><br/>Road to the Moon features the race to the Moon, the historical event that started in the early 1960s and that ended in July 1969, after the successful completion of the Apollo 11 mission.<br/><br/>The game features both a campaign and a sandbox mode. In campaign mode, you will be able to play as the Director of either NASA or the Soviet Space Agency in order to beat the other side to be the first on the Moon. You can also lead the  Global Space Agency (GSA), an fictional space agency that combines programs from all the major space agencies in the world . In the GSA campaign, you will need to address the requests and short-term goals issued by government, and is geared towards those players who prefer a game experience focused on exploration instead of competition.  Alternatively, all three space agencies feature a Sandbox mode, which provides a more open-ended experience and allows you to try out different approaches without any political pressure.<br/><br/>You will be able to develop dozens of programs. Some examples include the X-15 and the PKA space planes, the Sputnik satellite, the Mercury, Voskhod, Apollo and Soyuz manned spacecraft and the Mars Viking probe. You are not limited to missions that did launch, as as the game also allows you to try out many concepts that were planned but that never left the drawing board. For example, instead of sending men to the Moon using the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR) approach used by Project Apollo in the late 1960s and early 1970s, you will be able to rewrite history and use either the alternative Gemini Earth Orbit Rendezvous (EOR) or Gemini Direct Ascent (DA) schemes. The number of options available ensure every game will be different and there is huge replay value.<br/><br/>To verify its accuracy and authenticity, the game, is being developed in consultation with Dr. Buzz Aldrin, former U.S. Air Force combat pilot (66 missions in Korea) and NASA astronaut, who took part in the first Moon landing mission and became the second human being to walk on the Moon.<br/><br/>If you have any interest in Space and its exploration this is a game you just do not want to miss!<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "145715": {"poll": [], "name": "Adidoku", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "7", "maxplayers": "6", "average": "6.92857", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["L\u00fadika y Artefactos"], "boardgameversion": ["Spanish edition"], "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Puzzle"], "age": "13", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "Adidoku is a new generation of puzles with a fun mix of characters, places and phrases.

Though player characters (PCs) have long grown familiar with the air-breathing world above, seldom do they venture into the depths, and when they do, they discover wonders they never dreamed exisited. The ocean offers a venue for adventure that is at once alien and appealing.

Players take turns competing against one another to see who will last from midnight to sunrise. Each player must keep their children alive and sane through the night.<br/><br/>The school bus sat waiting in front of the fairgrounds. Children from all parts of Harlington County were excited to start their trip, eager to see the Blue Mountain Campground on its opening weekend.  It was late evening when the Mayor wished the kids luck as they rose from their picnic tables, hurriedly shoving bits of cake into their mouths as they climbed aboard the old school bus.  Songs and the laughter of children would fill the first few hours, only to be cut short when one of the children called out &quot;I just saw a dark man standing in the road ahead of us.&quot;  As the laughter subsided and the children strained their eyes to see into the darkness, tree limbs burst through the windows, sending tiny glass fragments into the air that found their way into the soft flesh of the children. Metal groaned and cried out as the bus pitched over onto its side, sliding before finally ending up in a ditch on the side of the road. Screams echoed out of the interior of the bus as the children begun moving and freeing themselves from the wreckage. The driver lay dead against the wheel. It was almost midnight, and the children were alone in woods that could swallow them from every angle. It would be daybreak before anyone would even begin looking for them...<br/><br/>Players choose 1 card from the six gifted children cards and 4 random cards from the 24 children and assemble their survivors. Each child card displays the child's name, age, sanity level and &quot;end game&quot; point value. Your goal is to keep as many children alive and as sane as possible by sunrise. The gifted children have high sanity values and a special ability to help their group survive. These special abilities include the power to absorb a creature&rsquo;s damage, evade enemy attacks and even pass damage meant for you onto your opponent's survivors. Survival is key and differs from child to child. Some kids are young and low on sanity, while others may have increased sanity due to age or street smarts. Each child card contains a simple descriptive term like Bully, Class Clown, or Doll Baby to give insight into each child and add flavor to the core game.<br/><br/>The goal of Zero Hour is to survive from midnight until dawn. Each turn, a card from the Hour deck is flipped over, advancing time forward by one hour. The player with the highest point total at sunrise is declared the winner.  Each child has a point value indicated on their card that comes into play once the game is over.  Each player adds together whatever cards they are still holding to determine their point value total.

Each player on a team takes one shot at the cups on the other side of the table; if they make the ball into a cup, it is removed and the player takes a drink either from their own drink or the cup.

While these mysterious creatures of the swamplands are mostly known for their tendency to lead victims on wild goose chases into dangerous situations, the fact of the matter is that Pathfinder will-o&rsquo;-wisps are built more for mobile beaters with ridiculously high attack, damage, AC, and maneuverability (plus constant invisibility) than they are for being elusive or tricky. While all of these will-o&rsquo;-wisps can certainly hold their own in a fight, we aimed to capture a bit more of the essence of the wisp. The first result was the wispling (CR 2), a smaller, weaker version of the will-o&rsquo;-wisp that can instill fear on opponents with its unnerving touch and ghostly lights abilities, and then bask in that fear with their feast on fear ability.

Azrin is the resulting amalgam of two planes of existence brought together by a cataclysmic event known as &ldquo;The Equinox&rdquo;. This event brought about the destruction of the gods of both planes and threw the plane into chaos. The plane of Azrin now has two year cycles that govern which of the two planes is dominant. This change is represented by a change in seasons. Each of the four seasons is one year long. During the spring and summer, the plane and most of its inhabitants are in a peaceful, good-aligned state. The world is similar to a Grimm fairy tale or high fantasy setting. During the fall and winter, though, the plane becomes overwhelmingly evil and every moment is a struggle for survival. This is more akin to a dying earth or pulp barbarian setting. During these savage seasons, normally peaceful races like elves and gnomes are perverted into ghastly forms.<br/><br/>Special Mechanics <br/>In Equinox there are new &ldquo;seasonal&rdquo; mechanics. A character is either in a &ldquo;springblessed&rdquo; state or a &ldquo;wintertouched&rdquo; state. A springblessed state is the state the character is in during the two years of spring and summer. Likewise, a wintertouched state is the state the character is in during the two years of fall and winter where the evil plane rules. Certain spells and effects can artificially induce what state a character is in (example: A barbarian can throw himself into his wintertouched state during the spring and summer by going into a rage!).

The game design is meant to be simple and highly playable, yet one that portrays the historical challenges facing the combatants. Historically the US failed to bottle up the Spanish fleet, and was forced to undergo a lengthy blockade while the US Army fought the Spanish garrison for control of the city and port. The capture of key fortifications and the heights at Kettle and San Juan Hills compelled Admiral Pascual Cervera to sortie on July 3rd to prevent his ships from being sunk at their moorings by US artillery, or capture when the town surrendered.

No one knows why, not that anyone even knows why they were fighting in the first place, but they left Triple-G, and according to rumors, they left the rest of the Expanse as well, and slinked off to their homeworlds to do Void knows what.  And who cares! Because they're gone, it's a miracle, and needless to say, there has been much celebrating.  It is an exciting time to be alive, to be a free person, to be an info collector, to be anyone on Triple-G, but unfortunately we must remember that it is also an ominous time.

I also started drawing the graphics in Photoshop. Masq was supposed to be just a proof of concept, however the dot.com opportunity kicked in and given that there was nothing like Masq (this is still seems to be the case) we decided to turn it into a product. In those times most of the web was text.<br/><br/>Soon we discovered it would take much longer to develop Masq than we had anticipated. (Reasons for the delay later)<br/><br/>Around one year later we ran focus groups to test the first two episodes. The test was successful. Around this time Noah Falstein and Charles Swartz joined us as advisors.<br/><br/>We set up a shop in Mexico City with 8 people; 3 artists, one producer, two assistant producers and testers to accelerate the production of illustrations and testing.<br/><br/>It passed around another year before Ken Melville joined us as an advisor and started reviewing the dialogues and really making them work in English.<br/><br/>It took us 5 years to &quot;finish&quot;, and we only finished the downloadable version of Masq (2002). We just developed 2 episodes of the browser version.<br/><br/>The main reasons for the delay were the following:<br/>-     We really wanted the player choices to matter, and &quot;Real&quot; branching demanded many more scenes than anticipated.<br/><br/>-     We did not have adequate authoring tools. Macromedia Director is powerful but is not designed for the task.<br/><br/>-     Inexperience.<br/><br/>-    No way to delegate. The kind of interactive authoring that the genre demands is an organic mix of screenwriting, programming and game design understanding. This is not only a &quot;new&quot; skill, but an uncommon one.<br/><br/>-    Lack of resources during development. This forced us to spend a lot of time looking for more resources, and doing many necesary but distracting administrative tasks.<br/>From 2002 to 2004 we brought Masq public and start doing market tests as well as showing it to many people in the industry looking for support to keep developing stories. For more information about this, read:<br/><br/>The tests consisted of charging different prices to play, giving it away for free, asking different information or none at all, trying different low budget advertising channels to reach the users, and even exploring different target markets (within a very limited budget), gathering feedback form players, registering every path they took to play Masq, etc. We even ran more focus groups with one of the major game developers and publishers. These tests were very successful but those who were in charge inside this organization lacked the capacity to move the project forward.<br/><br/>In Abril 2007 Tom Francis from PCGamer magazine UK, found out about Masq and wrote a very postive review. From there on, many people started noticing Masq, appearing in the Belgium-Holland magazine PCGameplay who gave Masq a score of 88 out of 100, later in Computer Games magazine in Greece as well as many important blogs such as 4ColorRebellion, JustAdventure, Independent Gaming, Tigsource, Grand Text Auto, etc. Masq was just selected (08/2007) one of the Top 100 Games (all times) by PCGamer magazine UK.<br/><br/>Masq has been online since 2002, and has been played (to varying degrees) by more than 60,000 players. As of today, we keep receiving enthusiastic emails and incredibly positive reviews.<br/><br/>As today, we're looking for investors an strategic partners, distributors, believers, etc.<br/><br/>Intention:<br/><br/>Our intention was to create a new design model, an interactive entertainment genre capable of:<br/><br/>1.- Provoking in the player the kind of emotions that novels and movies do, but at a whole new level by leveraging the participatory and immersive qualities of interactive games. The kind of emotions mainly absent from games.<br/><br/>2.- Unleashing alternative personalities or facets of the players, embarking them on journeys of self-discovery as they contemplate moral and other exciting choices.<br/><br/>3.- Dealing with the broad range of themes and situations found in movies and novels, but offering the deeper experiential resonance of multilayered what-if scenarios.<br/><br/>4.- Making the interactive experience revolve around personal relationships with well-rounded characters instead of mainly dealing with the physical world as in most games.<br/><br/>5.- Being much easier to play than most games in the marketplace; easier interface, shorter learning curve, and far less frustrating to play for non-gamers.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "145881": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Antonio Recuenco-Mu\u00f1oz"], "poll": [], "name": "M\u00e1s-Menos", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Trick-taking"], "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Traditional Card Games"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Drawing from Michael Waitsman's Proteus rather than from Nomic-related card games, M&aacute;s-Menos is a trick-taking game for two players and a 32-card deck constructed around two variable winning conditions: one applied to single tricks and another applied to the whole game.

Players have a choice between a time trial mode and a Grand Prix mode. In the Grand Prix mode, the player is given five chances to get third place or better. Losing five times will ask the player to continue the game using the standings earned prior to getting disqualified, but the sixth loss will lead to game over.<br/><br/>The player's top five total times and the player's fastest lap are stored in the game's internal battery backed RAM.

It has mighty warriors, mysterious artifacts and deadly missiles. They are represented by disks of varying sizes and colors that have to be sent flying towards their targets with a well-aimed flick of a finger. Choose a side of the table and lead your order&rsquo;s army into a campaign of world conquest.<br/><br/>Desktopia games can vary substantially. The battlefield landscape is formed by the random conglomeration of objects that can usually be found on your desk or table. These may include books, cups, your laptop, a mouse or a remote control. The game pack includes a set of riveting scenarios. You can take part in a massive melee, rob caravans, perform speed missions under a hail of arrows and even solve riddles!<br/><br/>Each player will have his own small army represented by discs of different sizes and corresponding reference cards. Legendary heroes, tough veterans and faithful fighters each of them with unique abilities described on reference card will be at your disposal. Likewise there will be small missile disks, which can be used by some of your characters, and mighty artifacts, which you can take under control during the course of a battle.<br/><br/>In your turn you can activate three of your characters: flick the disk to attack or use a missile instead or cast a spell. There are a lot of interesting choices you will have each time - whom and how to activate, trying to make a risky long short or just safely moving your warrior into an advantageous position for the next move. In this game your tactical choices are much more important than anything else. You also have to try to make the best use of the synergy of the different warrior types in your army!<br/><br/>We actively encourage players to use everyday objects from their tables. Imagine a turned glass as a sphere of ice which could freeze some disks of your enemy, a book as an impregnable cliff, from which your archers could safely attack, or a vase as a control tower with 10 hit points.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "Russian first edition"], "age": "7", "name": "Desktopia", "playingtime": "10", "boardgamemechanic": ["Variable Player Powers"], "average": "6.28429", "usersrated": "21", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Finger Flicking Games"]}, "145912": {"rpgartist": ["Elizabeth Courts", "Rebekah Mendicino", "Hugo Solis"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "statistics": [], "name": "Pebble in the Pond: Within Wheels", "rpgdesigner": ["Justin Sluder"], "rpgproducer": ["Marny K.

Never underestimate roaming undead armies and always be on guard as the deadly dragon may strike at the most unfavorable time.<br/><br/>Players begin the game by choosing a hero and a race alliance.  This can be accomplished randomly, in turn order or by blind bid.  Once the selections are made, players will place their stronghold, hero and starting army on one of their race alliance territories, then in reverse order players will place their race lord on another alliance territory in a different province.<br/><br/>Player aid cards help players with their turn sequence, unit costs, casualty results and random events that may occur throughout the game.  Each players turn consists of the following sequence: A rune blessing that affects all players, players then purchase new units and structures and place them in a queue.  Each player then takes their turn moving units, initiating and resolving battles, deploying new units, collecting resources and updating their victory tracks.  All players may then heal heroes, repair damaged strongholds, draw new quests and resolve a cataclysmic event to end the turn.  There are 7 turns and if a player hasn't earned enough victory points through expansion, questing, killing other heroes or slaying the dragon the final cataclysm destroys the world and all players are defeated.<br/><br/>What really makes Battleborn Legacy stand out from other war games is a combination of features including the following:<br/><br/>1. Unique Battle boards for regiment and hero placement.  Color coded for easy unit placement, also coordinates with matching attack/defense dice.  <br/>2.  Heroes and units may become veterans through battles won.<br/>3. Random casualty chart that adds a real combat element to the game.<br/>4.

It is a land steeped in rune magic and blood, yet one where the various races &ndash; humans, elves, dwarfs, fauns, trolls, ogres, orcs, goblins and halflings &ndash; live in harmony, owing allegiance not to race but to one of the mighty factions that make up this war-torn kingdom.<br/><br/>Twelve Elements of War is a 28mm Tabletop skirmish wargame. A typical warband will include between 7 - 12 models (depending on your faction and style of play), activating one model at a time. Players alternate turns activating models, keeping both players engaged and thinking. Despite only activating one model at a time, it successfully simulates combined attacks with multiple models; the first attacks in a round weaken and lock-down a model, making it easier to finish off by attackers later in a round.<br/><br/>It uses a multiple D6 dice, one-roll system for all rolls during a battle. Roll a number of dice equal to the Model Statistic that you are using to attack/defend/employ, add bonus dice if you have an advantage of some type, like charging. Compare the result of this roll to the enemy model's statistic or enemy model's roll to see if you succeed. The dice system does not use charts or tables &amp; is used for all rolls, making the game extremely easy to learn.<br/><br/>The broad range of Faction Lists each bring something special to the battlefield, and each faction choose from the 9 fantasy races. Each Faction is balanced to each other, despite having multiple fantasy races and at least 6 roles per Faction to choose from. Successfully employing a variety of different races performing melee, shooting or magic roles on the battlefield is the key to winning.<br/><br/>Over 20 different mission combinations ensures that each game of Twelve Elements of War will different from the next. Creating a balanced warband is only the start; quick thinking, using the right model at the right time &amp; an assertive battleplan is the key to completing your objectives while denying your opponent theirs.<br/><br/>The fun with Twelve Elements of War doesn't finish after one game. Twelve Elements of War has a complete Campaign system that sees your models gain experience, better abilities, new skills, money and magical runic items as they play battles and also explore the world of Lumria acquiring strange and unique items. You will also have the option to visit a town after each game. In town you can choose to go to the Tavern to recruit new members and heroes, The Market to purchase new items and equipment, the Arena to watch pit fighting and maybe pick up a few pointers. Lastly the Temple, where you can prey to the gods to heal your wounds or ask for their blessing in future battles. In addition to visiting these places, you roll on one of four unique &ldquo;random encounter charts&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Games can be played on a vast variety of battlefield types, from cautious tactical advances in the snow covered Forest of Sighs, to fast paced skirmishes leaping from building top to building top in the sprawling Port City of Arcadia.<br/><br/>Lastly, with 100's of magical  item combinations to try out and over 36 unique runic spells to cast with your magic users, this game has a large amount of re-playability.<br/><br/>Factions in the core book include:<br/><br/>- The elite soldiers of Highguard, vying to restore their city-state to its former glory.<br/>- The tough, guerrilla warriors of the Mining Guild, seeking to control valuable mineral resources across the continent.<br/>- The Geniocracy of Toth, who strive to expand their knowledge of technology, science and magic &ndash; by sword&rsquo;s edge if need be. <br/>- The sorcerers of the Shadow Hold, adepts at runic magic, and served by thrall workers and brainwashed fighters.

And there ensued at Mag Tuireadh a terrible battle for control of the lands and their treasures...<br/><br/>The Fomorian War is a card game for 3 or 4 players lasting about 30 minutes. Players secretly choose Tuatha deities to help them in battle as part of a clan as they fight for control of the lands and treasures of Ireland. They can also appeal to the Fomor for help of an underhanded sort or use the power of sacred items. Winning a battle for their clan gains Victory Points.<br/><br/>The game continues for a series of rounds or until all the lands and their treasures are held by one clan. The player with the most Victory Points is then declared the winner.<br/><br/>Needed to play - The deck of 54 cards and 2 eurocubes per player. Players may elect to keep score with pen and paper.<br/><br/>Play:<br/><br/>Each round of the game is played in the same order of phases.<br/><br/>Phase 1 - Battle Area. Depending on their chosen detiy, a player will choose which two cards in the Circle of Cards which will be the Battle Sites. The two cards chosen must show different Clan Holding Icons in the lower left. The cards must be adjacent to each other.<br/><br/>Phase 2 - Choose Tuatha Ally. The current start player will shuffle the Tuatha Deck and discard two cards face down to the center of the Circle of Cards, and then choose one of the remaining cards from the deck, keeping it secret from the other players. They will then pass the rest of the deck the player to their left to choose a card from those that remain. The deck will be passed this way until each player has chosen a card. Any remaining cards are discarded to the center.<br/><br/>Phase 3 - Reveal Warrior Cards. Each player, beginning with the current start player, will now play one or more Warrior Cards in front of them, face up for all other players to see. These Warrior Cards will add Battle Point Values, for their clans, to the respective Battle Site cards and their initial Battle Point Values.<br/><br/>Players of the same clan are trying to beat the combined Battle Point Value of the other clan.<br/><br/>Phase 4 - Reveal Tuatha Allies. Now each player will, in turn, reveal their hidden Tuatha Ally. The current start player will call out the numbers in order (from 1 to 7) and the player possessing that numbered card will reveal it and the power of that card may be used by the player. Tuatha allies are resolved in order.<br/><br/>Phase 5 - Resolve Battle. After the Tuatha, and Sacred Item and Fomor powers have been resolved, total the Battle Point Values for each clan and compare. The winner is the clan with the most Battle Points. The losing clan&rsquo;s Battle Site card is flipped over to the other side to show the winning clan&rsquo;s alignment icon. In the case of a tie, no Battle Site cards are flipped and no Victory Points are awarded in Phase 6.<br/><br/>Phase 6 - Victory Points. All players of the winning clan receive Victory Points as stated by the chart at the bottom the winning Battle Site card. Track Victory Points on the Score Card.<br/><br/>Phase 7 - Discard and Draw new Warrior Cards or add Cattle Herd.<br/>Discard all used Warrior Cards to the discard pile.<br/><br/>Phase 8 - New Start Player. The player to the left of the current start player is now the new start player.<br/><br/>Game End:<br/><br/>The game ends in one of two ways:<br/>A. After 8 rounds if playing with 4 players, or 9 rounds if playing with 3 players.<br/>B. If all of the cards in the Circle show the same Clan Holding icon.<br/><br/>At this point the player with the most Victory Points is the winner.

This period is often considered to feature the birth of Western Warfare, as opposed to the Persian/Eastern style, which relied on archery , light cavalry, and mobility.<br/><br/>Exactly how hoplite warfare was fought &ndash; what really happened when &ldquo;the bell rang&rdquo; &ndash; is highly disputed by ancient military historians, even today. Hoplite allows you to test out your theories (well, our theories, using your dice) with eleven of the great battles of this era, from the Battle of Leuctra, featuring the huge 60-man deep phalanx of Beotarch Epaminondas to the classic confrontations with the Persian missile-armed troops against the classic Greek hoplite phalanxes.<br/><br/>Hoplite uses detailed mechanics meant to convey all the possibilities of this style of warfare, from The Hellenic Law of Inertia, to Drift to the Right, to the special capabilities of the Persian Light Cavalry (Harassment and Dispersal) to three different levels of Hoplite advance to Combat (the Run Don&rsquo;t Walk rules) and a whole lot more.  We even still have some good old chariots!<br/>  <br/>And you get to fight what was the biggest land battle in European history up until Napoleonic times, the immense Battle of Plataea (truly the deciding engagement of the Greco-Persian Wars):  two maps and about 250 combat  counters covering The Greek Contingents from 26 City-States under Pausanias, Spartan Regent and General, vs. The Persians, Medes, Asians (Bactrians, Scythians, Indians and a whole lot of others) and seven Medized Greek city-states, under Mardonius, Persian Commander and son-in-law of The Great King, Darius I.<br/> The package includes Simple GBoH versions for each of the battles along with special rules that highlight the hoplite style of warfare.<br/><br/>Hoplite is the ultimate board game simulation on the birth of Western Warfare.

Amazing technological breakthroughs would change all of that in the year 2112. The invention of the Near Faster Than Light (NFTL) drive would make it possible for large ships to move easily in and out of a planet's gravity well, and to travel quickly within the confines of a solar system. Ten years later, the perfecting of Faster Than Light (FTL) drive would turn the galaxy into an open canvas. United by a common purpose, the newly formed Terran Confederation began to paint their picture. <br/><br/>Expansion led to colonies, research stations, and even more technological discoveries, but it also led to the realization that they were not alone. Although no sentient alien species had been encountered, long range scanners had picked up the distinctive signatures of FTL drives. Sentient races must exist... and they must be space faring. Terran expansion stopped. <br/><br/>Not knowing what to expect, a period of consolidation followed which emphasized defensive technologies and fleet building. First contact was made by the people of Earth with this unknown race in 2227. Over time, they would eventually call these other-worlders the Talon. It was a shortening of the alien sounds that made up their name but it was also oddly prophetic-the Talon Empire swooped in very much like a raptor upon the fledgling Terran Confederation.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/><br/>Units:  Individual capital ships and fighters<br/><br/>Time:  Individual fleet battles<br/><br/>Players:  2 to 6<br/><br/>Map:  Each hex represents a region of space that normally holds only one ship<br/><br/>Solitaire Suitability: there is no hidden information and no simultaneous action<br/><br/>Welcome to the Talonverse.....<br/>Talon is a game of tactical space combat set in a growing universe with its own history and back story.  This game introduces battles during the First Talon War between the Terran Confederation and the Talon Empire.<br/><br/>This is a Fleet Combat game.  Battles with individual ships can be fought, but the game easily and quickly simulates combat with fleets of 3-10 ships. These are fleets of Capital Ships.  This is NOT a game about fighter combat in space.  Most ships in the game are large and you must balance your ships' power output between shields, weapons, sensors and maneuverability - you are not just doing an Immelman.  Each faction has unique abilities and each ship has unique features.  Proper strategy involves assessing the different abilities of your ships and the enemy's.<br/><br/>This is an Accessible game.  The complexity of managing fleets of capital ships has been baked into the game system, leaving the player free to make interesting decisions.  It is also a Fast Paced game.  Small fleet scenarios can be played in one hour, larger ones in under two.  This makes the game thematically rich and full of quick but meaningful choices.<br/><br/>How can the game do all this?  All a ship's energy use is integrated into something called a Power Curve.  All a player has to do is adjust the speed of the ship.  A ship's speed determines how much Available Power it gets to charge weapons faster, reinforce shields, tighten turns... but there will never be enough of it.  The game is fought on a Map - distances moved, firing arcs, shield arcs are distinct and easily resolved.  The game uses Very Large, Laminated Counters.   All of a ship's systems are displayed directly on the counter and lamination allows you to mark damage and other ship info with a dry erase marker.  All of the important information is at your fingertips, at-a-glance, on the map. Being able to see the battle unfold on map allows the game system to handle a much larger number of ships without confusion and effort.<br/><br/>Game Features<br/><br/>     Terran Fleet (10 different ship classes)<br/>     Talon Fleet (9 different ship classes)<br/>     Ships with 4 Shield Arcs<br/>     Fighter Squadrons<br/>     Bases, Transports<br/>     Unique Abilities for each faction<br/>     Asteroids, Planets, Nebulae<br/>     Black Holes, Worm Holes<br/>     6 Different Weapon Systems including Missiles that track on the board<br/>     NFTL and FTL Drives<br/>     12 Scenarios following the story of the First Talon War<br/>     Mission Variety: Escort missions, planetary invasions, base assaults...<br/>     Lifetime Score tracking <br/>     Empire War campaign game with dynamic, strategic-level decisions<br/>     Point System for Purchasing Ships and Design-Your-Own Scenarios<br/>     A tie in with Space Empires 4x<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "name": "Talon", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement", "Hex-and-Counter", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["Talon 1000"], "usersrated": "273", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "average": "7.85729", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Dukes of Dice - Ep. 40 - When Colts Cry", "If You Buy One Game - Space Games!"]}, "145980": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Alex Huntley"], "average": "6.66667", "poll": [], "name": "ArcWorlde", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1745961_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Alex Huntley"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Warploque Miniatures"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The First Roll - What's New on Kickstarter? - Episode 71: Friday, September 30th", "The First Roll - What's New on Kickstarter? - Episode 72: Monday, October 3rd"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1745961.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Fantasy", "Miniatures"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From Beasts of War;<br/><br/>&ldquo;ArcWorlde, is a skirmish tabletop game, set in the fantasy realm of ArcWorlde.

Activating your models in larger groups can leave your opponent free reign at the end of the turn if all your models have acted.<br/><br/>&quot;Other unique aspects of ArcWorlde are smaller &ldquo;side-quests&rdquo; within the main game itself. These are entirely optional, and by no means an essential component of the ArcWorlde game, but they add flavour and fun if the players so wish! There are Forgotten Tombs, where the player can delve inside to uncover lost treasure, or terrible evil. There are the Epic Duels, where ANY of the models on the board can engage in mighty combat, fighting to the death for glory and prestige. There are many more work-in-progress side quests, which will be added to the rulebook if the Kickstarter does as well as I hope!<br/><br/>"}, "145982": {"poll": [], "name": "Starbowl Football", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Atari 8-bit edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Sports - American Football"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Gamestar"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["Atari 8-bit family"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Gamestar"], "description": "Rules Manual<br/><br/>Congratulations!
