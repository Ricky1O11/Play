The card portion of the platform should be broken up into 13 individual cards which are called the &quot;LETTERS&quot;. The LETTERS are then placed, FACE UP, in a POOL next to the playing board, in easy reach of all players.<br/>2. Each player then selects a wood pawn and places it on the space marked &quot;START&quot; in the center of playing board<br/>3. Each player now spins the arrow of the spinner - the one with the highest number starts. In case of tie, player spins again.<br/>4. Play passes to the left<br/><br/>Object of the game:<br/>The player who is FIRST to enter Ellsworth's House with the most LETTERS, is the WINNER.<br/><br/>Special Feature of the Game:<br/>This game consists of two parts - the first from START to the GATE - the second from the GATE to ELLSWORTH's HOUSE, including the HOME PATH and BONUS SPACE<br/><br/>The Play:<br/>1. In the first part of the game (area from START to GATE) the first player spins and moves his pawn the number of spaces in any direction he chooses (either forward of backward). Player can never split his move and must always move on his turn according to the number he spins.<br/>2. Any number of players may rest on the same space at the same time.<br/>3. Whenever a player, in the first part of the game, lands on a color space by EXACT COUNT, he picks up the LETTER with the matching color stamp from the POOL. He must read aloud the question on that letter and the three different answers given below it. He then must state aloud which ANSWER he thinks is right, A, B or C. Each question on the LETTERS is numbered and the ANSWER CHART here in the box cover lists these numbers with their correct answers - A, B or C. If he has answered correctly, he gets a bonus move of 10 additional spaces. If his answer is incorrect, he remains on that color space until his next turn. In either case, he keeps the LETTER.<br/>4. Each player has to place the LETTERS he picks, FACE UP in front of him, so that all players around the board can see them.<br/>5. As long as there are LETTERS left in the POOL, NO player can enter the second part of the game. After the last LETTER has been picked up from the POOL, all players place their respective pawns on the space marked GATE and all start from there equally on the second part of the game.<br/>6. From the GATE to the Beginning of the HOME PATH, players move only in a forward direction.<br/>7. Whenever a player in the second part of the game lands by EXACT COUNT on a color space, he has this choice - he may take the matching color LETTER from the player who has it, or, he may advance 10 spaces.<br/>8. The section of the pathway from the last color space to Ellsworth's House, is the HOME PATH. Once a player advances into the HOME PATH, he moves within it, forward or backward as he chooses. When a player lands by EXACT COUNT on the BONUS SPACE, he may take from any other player any LETTER he desires, regardless of the color stamp.<br/>9. Since a plyer cannot win, unless he enters ELLSWORTH'S HOUSE with the most LETTERS, he will move back and forth within the HOME PATH until hes has more letters than the other players. As LETTERS can be taken away in the HOME PATH, there is great excitement and suspense. Until the last moment of the game, nobody knows who will safely enter ELLSWORTH'S HOUSE.<br/>10. To enter ELLSWORTH's HOUSE, a player does not need an exact count on the spinner.<br/><br/>FAMILY RULES<br/>When more advanced children or grown-ups join the the game, the regular rules are followed, except that in the first part of the game, all questions and answers are omitted when players pick up LETTERS, but the bonus move of 10 spaces is still given.<br/><br/>"}, "129503": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1409127.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Leviticus Williamson"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Leviticus Williamson"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Williamson Games"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1409127_t.png", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Sports", "Word Game"], "description": "Wacky family word bowling game that features a unique wooden character dice ball that determines the amount and location of bowling pin tiles to flip over in attempt to spell words in each bowling frame to score big points.

These cards wear Silks not Suits.<br/><br/>This is the only game that tells you the Winners before you Start. The only question is who holds the Winning hand.

The Key to Trifecta Poker is that the winning hand is based on a Trifecta of winning Horse Cards.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Dealer shuffles the 52 Cards and draws 3 different Horse Cards in a vertical display outward from the POT known as the&nbsp;Trifecta Flop.&nbsp;After each play the cards are shuffled and a new Trifecta Flop is drawn. The First Horse drawn is the Winning Horse, the 2nd is the Place and the 3rd is the Show - aka WPS. or a Superfecta game a 4th Horse is drawn.&nbsp;Duplicate Horse cards if they appear in the Flop are returned to the deck. Dealer then re-shuffles the remaining deck and deals 5 cards to each player. Players may now hold pat their original cards or draw from one to four new cards from the deck. The Player with the highest combinations of Trifecta, Quinella, or WPS card combinations wins. A Trifecta is all three winning horses, a Quinella is the Win and Place horses, and the WPS are any horses in the money. WPS combinations are ranked by the highest number of Horse cards in the money without a Trifecta or Quinella.<br/><br/>All Trifecta Poker hand rankings can be improved by also holding typical Poker combinations as shown below:<br/><br/>    For instance no. 1 : A Trifecta with a pair of any horses beats a Trifecta with no pair.<br/>    For instance no. 2: A Win horse with three of a kind beats a Win horse with a pair.<br/>    If NO players hold WPS Cards typical Poker Hand rankings are won as follows:<br/>    Four of a Kind - Four of the same Horse cards.<br/>    Full House- Three of a kind and a pair. The player with the higher value three of a kind, wins in the event of a tie. If both players have the same three of a kind then the player with the highest pair wins.<br/>    Straight -Five cards of any horses in ascending order with the higher straight wins the tie.<br/>    Three of a Kind- Simply three cards of the same horse.<br/>    Two Pairs of Horses - The player holding the highest pair takes the pot in the event that more than one player is holding two pairs. If two players are both holding the same two pair then the player with the highest fifth horse (i.e. the kicker) takes the pot.<br/>    One Pair of Horses-Two cards of the same horse.<br/>    HIGH Horse -Highest card takes all in the event there is a complete absence of the above hands.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "129549": {"rpgdesigner": ["Nathan Crowder"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Perfectbound edition"], "poll": [], "name": "Ports of Call: The Frontier Zone", "rpgartist": ["Kurt Komoda"], "rpgproducer": ["Leonard Balsera", "Robert Donoghue", "Fred Hicks", "Brennan Taylor"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1591502.png", "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Bulldogs!

It is a world where stories focus upon the nobility and the affairs of state. Herein, the eight great nation-states of the Realm and the alien powers of both the hinterlands and antipodes acknowledge the sovereignty of the imperial Coronal. A celestial family of puissant nobles leads the Imperium, each of whom has attained near-immortality and stand at the centre of the Realm&rsquo;s web of intrigue. The emperor is none other than Friedreich M&uuml;nchausen, known better by the title of the Invictus.<br/><br/>In Eidolon, the people enjoy a sophisticated technology buoyed by the uncanny advancements of alchemical forges and electrodyne engines; their artefaction precipitating an age of wonder. Newton&rsquo;s fulmonry has opened the starry heavens, having launched the space race of the 17th Century, and the Imperium now enjoys colonies on the planetary gears of Barsoom and Amtor. Alchemical contraceptives ushered in the sexual revolutions of the 1860s, creating robust libertine affects throughout contemporary society. The burgeoning vogue of planetary and science heroes has divided the generations, with the aristocracy cleaving to baroque mores, even as the bourgeoisie embrace avant-garde vogues.<br/><br/>Thus, the Electrodyne Opera is a drama of politics, a game of thrones, and a work of blood and thunder. It celebrates the lives of the nobility in romance and tragedy, exalting their best and revelling in their worst. For each noble contends with his or her own fate, bound as they are to the mythic force known as the skein, making their life a passion play striving for immortality and apotheosis.<br/><br/>"}, "129593": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Bobcat of Futureville", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Dice Rolling", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Set Collection", "Stock Holding", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamefamily": ["Monopoly"], "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)"], "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Negotiation"], "age": "25", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Monopoly with a Bobcat construction equipment theme.<br/><br/>From the box: With Bobcat of Futureville, you too can live the life of a Bobcat dealer.

We will prevail!&quot;<br/><br/>- Field Commander Miranda Petite in an address to Black Talon Forces, TN 27 Summer 1950<br/><br/>The next few days will decide the fate of the planet, and although few know it, the fate of the galaxy and of humankind rests on Terra Nova.<br/><br/>This Full-Color, 54-page book is a campaign supplement for the Heavy Gear Blitz!

The player who has gathered most cards is the winner.<br/><br/>Before starting to play, shuffle the 24 cards well and place them on the fields with the blue side upwards and with the poles of the sign posts pointing all in the same direction. No card should be placed on the field with the traffic lights. This field is used to place the pieces. Now agree on a player who starts, and then alternate clockwise. The player whose turn it is throws the dice and forwards his piece on the game board by the number of pips. After starting the game, the field with the traffic lights must not be entered again. You may move in all directions but not diagonally. During a move you may change the direction as often as you want. However, you have to keep two things in mind: you must not move on to a field twice during a move, and at the end of the move you must not arrive at the starting field. Bad luck, if you throw a six, because you will have to miss this turn. If a move ends on a field with a card, you have to guess which of the two signs shown on the blue side is displayed on the yellow side of the card. Subsequently look whether the traffic sign you think is shown on the yellow side. If the guess was correct, the player may take the card. The player places this card with the blue side upwards in front of himself. If the guess was wrong, the player has to return the card to the same place on the game board. If one card only is left on the game board, the player whose turn it is may throw the dice twice and move. If this card has been removed as well, every player counts his cards.

Your Crystals double as &quot;Life Points&quot; and resources.<br/><br/>At the beginning of your turn you draw 3 cards from your deck, then you may discard a card from your hand and add a number of Crystals to your Crystal-Pool equal to the Crystal Value of the discarded card (which doubles as cost to play the card from your hand). Then, in Main Phase, you may play Characters and Relics and have your Characters attack the opponent. Each unblocked attack results in 2 Crystals being removed from your opponent's Crystal Pool. If at any point a player has no more Crystals left in their Pool, they lose the game immediately.<br/><br/>Crystal Clash consists of two preconstructed, well balanced decks with 40 UNIQUE cards each.

The game uses a system of 3d12 rolls, with modifiers to the minimum and maximum that may be rolled.  Each roll will have a modifier of +X/-Y (EG. +1/-1, +4/-2, +0/-3).  The +X portion determines the minimum result of each of the d12, and the -Y determines the maximum.  A modifier of +2/-2 would mean that each die can result in the range of 3-10 (1+2, 12-2), the total roll being anywhere between 9 and 30.<br/><br/>The game setup involves a map with 1&quot; hexes of a size predetermined by either a provided scenario or popular decision.  Terrain involves transparent overlays called terrain Plates that have visual cues as to which form(s) of terrain are included (Obscure, Hostile , Hostile , Resistant).  Terrain Plates can overlap, and each terrain type present in a given hex applies in a &quot;yes/no&quot; fashion.<br/><br/>Players agree on the number of units and of which types that each will bring into play.  Given a default game of 1v1 death match, each player will have four Epishell (humanoid mech) units.  For each unit they will decide the variety from Scout, Assault, Marksman, and Escort and apply modular designed equipment based on the carrying capacity of that unit.  Pilots are also assigned to the units with a zero sum trait set.  Typically, each player will have a side of the map to treat as their starting area.  Time and objectives will be determined by popular decision before the terrain is placed and the units outfitted.<br/><br/>During game play, each player has a set number of &quot;MOVE&quot; and &quot;FIRE&quot; actions equal to half of their total unit count, rounded up and may only allot one to each unit at the start of the &quot;Circuit&quot;.  A countdown procedure occurs using the traits of the units, giving priority to &quot;FIRE&quot; actions.

Some of them might have reasons; some reasons might stem from a childhood of horrific abuse. But the fact remains they kill because some part of their mind wants to kill. Some of them are smart. Some of them are unbelievably intricate. Some of them weave complex plots around what they are doing. Serial killers might evade police for years, or, as in the case of The Green River Killer in Seattle, forever. Sometimes they kill themselves, and sometimes they turn themselves in. The latter occurred in the case of Edmund Kemper, who called the police after killing his mother. This book is not attempting to glorify anything, and it is not attempting to make the lives of serial killers seem neat or interesting or exciting. This book is here because serial killers are a reality and would exist in a place like Haven. There are no rules in this book for playing serial killers. This book is designed for a responsible, adult audience. While all of this material can be ported over to any modern d20 campaign, it has been designed with Haven: City of Violence D20 Modern in mind, and as such it might be too gritty or lethal for more general d20 games.<br/><br/>"}, "129735": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2475101.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Star Wars Death Star Boom Boom Balloon"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Frans Rookmaaker"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Anne P\u00e4tzke"], "boardgamepublisher": ["AS Company", "Dujardin", "Identity Games International B.V.", "Intrafin Games", "Schmidt Spiele", "Simba Toys", "Spin Master Ltd."], "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2475101_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity"], "boardgamehonor": ["2013 Golden Geek Best Children's Board Game Nominee", "2013 Kinderspielexperten \"8-to-13-year-olds\" Nominee", "2013 Kinderspielexperten \"8-to-13-year-olds\" Winner"], "description": "To set up Bumm Bumm Ballon!, you place a colored balloon inside the wood frame, pull out the wooden rods, then get ready to go!

Place the cards on the triangle bases of the board according to which attribute they represent. The creatures carry 2 different numbers: The left number indicates the strength and the right number the Bonus you receive when you kill a Creature. To destroy a Creature you must roll a number with your Pawndie higher from the one which represents his Strength and place it on the opposite Tribase where this Creature is located. When you do that, you draw as many Tricards as the Bonus number this Creature caries on his right side. You keep these cards and you may use them as you wish. Note: The Rules of the Basic Game Apply here too, the only difference is that the Creatures add new elements in the game. You also keep and the Creature you killed since it counts as part of the collected cards.

Having experienced the vagaries of war (such as the sudden wild charge of cavalry or the nighttime sneak attack of bushwhackers), the Rifleman knows that what once was a battle of distance can suddenly be up close and personal, and the weapon good for dealing death from afar can quickly become a hindrance spelling the wielder&rsquo;s doom. Rather than give up the weapon he loves, by necessity the Rifleman has learned how to use his longarm to pump lead quickly and accurately into any enemy, whether close up or far away.<br/><br/>Becoming so skilled at wielding his favorite longarm, the Rifleman makes every move with such flair and flamboyance that it elicits awe and wonder from onlookers, and more than a little trepidation from enemies. The marksman who wants to become famous as a great Rifleman knows that his reputation must extend as far as the eye can shoot. Therefore, he practices night and day with his chosen longarm, until he can fire it with style and elan at any target, at any range. Rapid-fire speed, pinpoint accuracy, and the ability to wield his normally long range weapon with equal skill at close quarters, is the unique brand of the Rifleman.<br/><br/>The Rifleman can&rsquo;t be satisfied with just taking a few pot shots at long range, he is trained to pump a barrel full of lead into his enemies, near and far.

But wait &ndash; these aren't the knights of old, but rather their children. Can these newcomer knights prove up to the task of tracking the dangers out there and putting a stop to them before it's too late?<br/><br/>In Shadows over Camelot: The Card Game, the players (mostly) work together to complete quests before the danger level of a quest gets too high.<br/><br/>In game terms, the quests are represented by five types of cards, with each card showing 1-3 swords, as well as a number from 2 to 5 or a question mark. These cards are shuffled together with Morgan le Fay cards (which curse the players when they appear) and Merlin cards (which remove some aspects of the curse) to form the rumor deck. Each player receives a secret loyalty card at the start of the game, with at most one person being a traitor to the cause. On a turn a player either:<br/><br/><br/>    Reveals a rumor card.<br/>    Attempts a quest.<br/>    Accuses a knight.<br/><br/><br/>To reveal a rumor card, the player flips it onto the top of the revealed stack of cards. If it's a quest card, players try to keep track of the total value of cards from that quest, with ?s each worth as many points as the number of ?s revealed of that quest. If a Morgan le Fay is revealed, players can no longer speak to one another; in addition, Morgan twists the values of some cards or removes some from play. Merlin allows players to speak once again.<br/><br/>Players are trying to stop quests when the total value is 11, 12 or 13. Any lower, and they arrived too soon, wasting time; any higher, and they arrived too late. To attempt a quest, the player points to the top quest card and says, &quot;It's time.&quot; The player then reveals all cards in the deck. If the sum of that quest is 11-13, then the players receive 1-3 white swords, as shown on the quest cards. If lower, they receive one black sword; if higher, 1-3 black swords. All other quests are checked to see whether the players were too late, then the stack resets. A failed quest rewards the attempter with a special bonus card for later use.<br/><br/>Once three swords have been claimed, whatever the color, a player can choose to accuse another player of being traitorous to the cause, winning a reward if correct and a penalty otherwise. If the players collect seven white swords, they have stopped Morgan's forces and win. If, however, they collect seven black swords first, then Arthur's kingdom falls.<br/><br/>Reimplements<br/><br/>    Shadows over Camelot<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual first edition"], "average": "5.78862", "name": "Shadows over Camelot: The Card Game", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Memory", "Partnerships"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": ["Shadows over Camelot: The Card Game \u2013 Merlin & Morgan Promo cards"], "usersrated": "893", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["The Legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table", "Shadows over Camelot"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["1P 031 - Shadows Over Camelot the Card Game", "Cubepushers - Episode 3: To Theme Or Not To Theme", "Ep 16 Development With Josh Lobkowicz", "Exploring Games, Episode 9 - Where I Actually Talk About Games"]}, "129906": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Passing"], "statistics": [], "name": "Passing (Alpha)", "rpgdesigner": ["William Duryea"], "rpgproducer": ["William Duryea"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1404808.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Adult / Mature", "Comedy / Satire", "History (Americas)", "Weird / Surreal"], "rpgpublisher": ["Misery Tourism Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1404808_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>1915. The darkest moment for American race relations since the Civil War. Jim Crow rules the American South. All of the progress towards racial equality made during Reconstruction has been undone by poll taxes, segregation, sharecropping and intimidation.<br/><br/>Sundown towns spread across the country. Their name comes from one unbreakable rule: only whites are allowed in town after the sun sets. The punishment for blacks who linger within the town limits at night is rarely stated, but universally understood.<br/><br/>In one of these sundown towns, a group of local leaders meets on Saturday nights to talk civics, play cards and wax nostalgic about slavery. They are the town aristocracy. They plan business deals and church picnics. They investigate newcomers and see that the law is enforced.<br/><br/>Normally, they would be talking about the price of tobacco and the lost honor of the Confederacy, but not recently, not since they found the first dead man. Now they are talking about bloodless corpses and the superstitious rumors spreading among the sharecroppers. Now they&rsquo;re talking about vampires.<br/><br/>What these gentlemen do not know is that one of them is the vampire. What they also do not know is one of them was born black, and has been carefully keeping his secret to protect his position and his life. As suspicion grows, it becomes harder and harder for both of these men to preserve their reputations&mdash;and their lives.<br/><br/>Passing is a simple, rules light RPG about paranoia, racism and identity.

A few of the largest campaigns could stretch to four hours or so.<br/><br/>The game engine has simple systems for geography, human terrain, and operational personality unique to each campaign (theatre) represented.&nbsp;The player takes the role of the colonel in charge of a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), a reinforced brigade capable of independent operation. The player selects a Campaign from the Campaign pool. This pool is composed of twelve cards each detailing a hot spot selected for its interesting nature and probability of US ground force involvement in the foreseeable future. The hot spots include Venezuela, Liberia, Mexico, South Korea, Egypt, and Gaza.<br/><br/>An expeditionary unit&rsquo;s force composition is variable. After selecting a Campaign card, the player then selects appropriate forces and takes the unit counters for those forces for use during the game. The player takes markers for opposition forces (OpFor) and geography relevant to the Campaign, and sets those into pools for use, as well. Player forces are predominantly ground units, with some air units for supply, transport, and fire support. Naval forces are not represented, though some of the ground forces have amphibious capability.<br/><br/>Play takes place on the OpsDisplay (map) which uses boxes, tables, and other features to manage the information, systems, and battle spaces portrayed in the game.<br/><br/>Each unit typically represents a platoon (about 40 marines) or a handful (2 to 4) helicopters or fixed-wing aircraft. Units begin in the Bravo Base box on the OpsDisplay. As the player is assigned Operations, he or she deploys forces from Bravo Base to tracks containing said Operations to meet their respective conditions.<br/><br/>The game is played in a series of turns that represents days or weeks. Each turn introduces an Operation to which the player assigns forces. These forces carry out Missions with the objective of completing the Operation. Each Operation completed yields a measure of success towards the objectives of the Campaign. The Campaign concludes when a set number of Operations is complete. Victory is determined by how effectively the player met the challenges of each Operation.<br/><br/>Each Operation is resolved by maneuvering units on a track of six boxes. The player carries out Missions for only one Operation on a single track at a time. Each track is composed of six boxes, called Grids. A Grid represents a small area, perhaps a few hundred square kilometers typified by a single, prevailing terrain or community. As an Operation&rsquo;s milestones are met, the player&rsquo;s forces move farther down that Operation&rsquo;s track.<br/><br/>The player may carry out as many as six Operations at a time. At that pace, the player&rsquo;s forces will be stretched very thin. Continuous operations will exhaust units, as will enemy action. Units can recover at Bravo Base either at the conclusion of an Operation or by pulling out of the Operation prior to completion. Bravo Base is more than an area for staging and R&amp;R. The player may also have units conduct Rehearsals to improve their respective effectiveness in one of the four capabilities.<br/><br/>Unlike a typical wargame, combat is only one of four primary functions of each unit. Units are rated on the bases of Kinetics (combat), ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance), CIMIC (Civil-Military Cooperation), and Engineering. The nature of a unit determines its effectiveness in each of these four capabilities. Each unit&rsquo;s effectiveness is portrayed numerically with a value of zero (no capability) to an upper-limit of five or so. A tank platoon might have capabilities of 5 0 0 0, while a Special Operations team might have values of 2 4 2 0. The tank platoon, with a Kinetics rating of 5, is peerless in a stand-up fight, but has no other capabilities. The Special Operations team can fight, but is much better at gathering Intel.<br/><br/>In most of the Campaigns represented in the game, the role of the MEU is more than just combat. The MGR design focuses on the broader range of missions faced by Marine commanders, including distinguishing bad guys from good guys, establishing bases, gathering intelligence, and gaining the trust and support of the locals.<br/><br/>Units that are not controlled by the player are collectively referred to as Opposition Forces (OpFor). The composition of OpFor is another aspect of MGR that departs from typical wargame design. OpFor units are composed predominantly of non-combatants. Shooting is easy. Separating legitimate targets from civilians is not. As the player&rsquo;s forces enter a Grid, the player will typically exert significant effort to identify the human terrain of the Grid, assess the risk, and take necessary action to establish required security.<br/><br/>"}, "129964": {"poll": [], "name": "Deep 3D: Submarine Odyssey", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iPhone edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Ocean / Sea", "Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Fishlabs"], "videogamegenre": ["Flight Simulator", "Sandbox"], "videogameplatform": ["iPhone"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Fishlabs"], "description": "Deep 3D&trade; is an enthralling action game with an extraordinary setting.

If a Gladiator fought well he could appeal for mercy in the hope that his performance had earned him a reprieve.<br/><br/>NOT SO IN THE WORLD OF TALOMIR.<br/><br/>Talomir, the fantasy world of Warrior Heroes and Rally Round the King, offers no such luxury. Gladiatorial combat thrives in Talomir but it&rsquo;s strictly on the job training. There are no Gladiator schools or benevolent Patrons that will provide you the chance to learn your craft. Instead you learn on the battlefield or in some cases the back alleys of the decadent cities of Tropilium or Demeskeen, home of the largest arenas. But more than likely you&rsquo;ll just die in some rat infested arena in a backwater town.<br/><br/>Ah, but if you succeed Fame and Fortune await.<br/><br/>Red Sand Black Moon uses mechanics similar to those found in Red Sand Blue Sky, the immensely popular game of Ancient Roman Gladiators. But Red Sand Black Moon takes it a step farther.<br/><br/>It allows you to fight gladiator matches with any fantasy figure you may already have!<br/><br/>Red Sand Black Moon has over twenty fantasy races with sixty plus characteristics or Signatures that allows you to create your own unique gladiator.

Then the character is pitted against randomly generated opponents (or gladiators generated by other players) on an arena divided into several zones. The closer to the heart of the arena, the better for the fighter.<br/><br/>All fights are fought to death of one opponent. In addition to standard attacks, some creatures are capable of special attacks like biting, spitting or tail attacks. Initiative is determined randomly and models react to their opponent's actions, so it's not a typical IGOUGO game.<br/><br/>For those who are familiar with Two Hour Wargames, this game is more detailed, as it aims at much lower number of miniatures than their other games.<br/><br/>Campaign rules allow to follow your gladiator on their journey to the heart of the empire, where most powerful enemies and greatest glory awaits.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.11111", "name": "Red Sand Black Moon: Fantasy Gladiatorial Combat", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": ["Red Sand Brown Sky"], "usersrated": "9", "boardgamefamily": ["Gladiators"]}, "129982": {"poll": [], "name": "Bundesliga Manager Professional", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English DOS edition", "German DOS edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1409935.png", "videogameseries": ["Bundesliga Manager"], "videogametheme": ["Sports - Soccer"], "usersrated": "4", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Management"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS"], "average": "7.1", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Software 2000"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1409935_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Bundesliga Manager Professional is the second soccer management game of Software 2000.
