Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The 1986 edition featured 4 parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to 5 players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.

The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.<br/><br/>Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).<br/>  <br/>     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.<br/><br/>Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.<br/><br/>The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.<br/><br/>As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.<br/><br/>Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.

One difference in the contents, however, is that bean #22's Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean.  This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Amigo / Tempo Edition", "Amigo 10 Year Anniversary tin edition", "Amigo edition 2010", "Amigo German / French edition", "Amigo German Fairplay Logo Edition", "Amigo/Tempo Special edition 2010", "Brain Games Baltic edition", "Chinese edition", "Copag Brazilian First Edition", "Czech Version", "Dutch edition", "English \"Yellow box\" edition", "English first edition", "French aluminum box version", "French edition 2015", "French Gigamic Edition", "French Quebec edition", "German 15th anniversary edition", "German edition 2016", "German First edition (3-5p)", "German Second edition with SdJ mark (3-5p)", "Gigamic French edition 2016", "Greek version", "Hungarian first edition", "Italian edition", "Italian edition", "Italian edition", "Japanese edition", "Kaissa Greek second edition", "Kikigagne French Expanded edition", "Korean version", "Latvian edition", "Lautapelit.fi Finnish/Swedish edition", "Lithuanian edition", "Lookout Fan Edition", "Mercurio Spanish edition", "Nordic edition", "Nordic edition 2013", "Polish Deluxe edition (aluminum box)", "Polish fifth edition", "Polish first edition", "Rio Grande / Amigo edition", "Rio Grande Fan Edition", "Romanian edition", "Russian First edition", "Scandinavian edition"], "average": "7.0667", "name": "Bohnanza", "videogamebg": ["Bohnanza"], "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Set Collection", "Trading"], "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": ["35589", "103186", "467", "1494", "14118", "189272", "174239", "43237", "216664", "168425", "35428", "6264", "59416", "205687", "31419", "178656", "8174", "111734", "913", "12677", "18793", "453", "4377", "2571", "13474"], "usersrated": "28203", "boardgameaccessory": ["Bohnanza Counters", "Bohnanza Sammelbox", "Bohnanza: Round Indicator"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Bohnanza", "Lookout Bean Games"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["#35: Fabled Fruit on tap; Six Pack of Games for the Holidays", "BGA Ep. 75 - Gamer FAQs: Everything You Need to Know About Gamer Terms", "BGA Episode 100 - Top 100 Games of All Time", "BGTG 115 - Spiel des Jahres, Then &amp; Now", "Episode 003", "Episode 10 \u2013 Amigo Spiele \u2013 Neuheiten Fr\u00fchjahr 2007", "Episode 14 - Gaming Like it's 1999", "Episode 16 - Bohnanza", "Episode 16: Bohnanza and Games from the Past", "Episode 27: Broom Service Review - Questions from a Hat", "Episode 32 - Top 50, Picks 30-21", "Episode 87- Haspelknecht", "Episodio 11 \u2013 Especial verano 2013: Juegos no jugados", "Episodio 14 \u2013 Especial verano 2014: Reglas mal explicadas", "ET111: Como agua para choco..

Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch.  The various tiles either give immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round.

On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards)&mdash;wood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone&mdash;to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game.<br/><br/>Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.<br/><br/>A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.<br/><br/>Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.<br/><br/>Catan has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.<br/><br/>Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed Catan to better represent itself as the core and base game of the Catan series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition.

If only 1 player chose a particular action, they simply perform that action. If 2 players chose the same action, they barter back and forth with gemstones. One player will eventually accept the other's offer of gems, and the other will take the action. If 3 or 4 players all chose the same action card, that action is cancelled.

They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyer belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. (source: <a target='_blank' href='http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon' rel='nofollow'>http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon</a>)<br/><br/><br/><br/>In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.<br/><br/>In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &quot;registers&quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!<br/><br/>Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.<br/><br/>The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Avalon Hill Edition", "Avalon Hill edition 2010", "Dutch edition", "German edition", "Play Factory edition", "Wizards of the Coast edition", "Wizards of the Coast Second Edition"], "average": "7.15587", "name": "RoboRally", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Grid Movement", "Modular Board", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["1569", "1968", "1967", "88354", "1966"], "usersrated": "19284", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games", "Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Robots"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BGTG - June 11, 2005 (Mike Mayer and Robo Rally)", "BGTG 136 - 100 Great Games, part 3 (with Stephen Glenn and Mark Jackson)", "Ep 39 Real Time", "Ep 42  Illustrations with Henning Ludvigsen", "Ep 47 Grey Fox Games with Josh Lebkowicz", "Episode 10: Cosmic Encounter/Why We Play", "Episode 33 - Top 50, Picks 20-11", "GameBreak Audio Episode #013 - Domo Arigato, Mister Roboto", "I've Been Diced! episode 10: Gateway games", "I've Been Diced! episode 3: Games that stood the test of time", "Ludology Episode 78 - Here We Are Now, Entertain Us", "MN 0035 Racing Games", "OBG 30: Start Your Engines", "Podcast #14: That Heart-Restarting Moment", "Polyhedron Collider Cast Episode 2"]}, "19": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic786075.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Klaus Teuber"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1991", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Chris McGloughlin", "Franz Vohwinkel"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Hans im Gl\u00fcck Verlags-GmbH", "Mayfair Games"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic786075_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["American West", "Bluffing", "City Building"], "boardgamehonor": ["1991 Deutscher Spiele Preis Best Family/Adult Game 3rd Place", "1991 Spiel des Jahres Winner"], "description": "A long time ago, in a village far, far away, some disturbed townsfolk decided to destroy their entire town in order to rid themselves of an evil menace (it's technically a dog-mouse, but I think it's an idiomatic thing).  Anyway, so the villagers rebuilt all the buildings in the town (including their precious outhouses), but forgot to include city walls, a river, or roads.  To rectify this, players lay tiles with one of these three things onto the board, and any building caught underneath them is automatically eliminated, except for outhouses.  When an outhouse would be destroyed, players take a vote on whether to place that particular section.  Each player is trying to retain the most of one type of building, and once all the pieces have been placed the winner is the person with the highest valued buildings still standing.<br/><br/>Wacky, Wacky West re-make description:<br/><br/>Fans of Klaus Teuber will be interested in this remake/redesign of Drunter und Dr&uuml;ber, a 1991 Spiel des Jahres winner.<br/><br/><br/>Just south of nowhere, there's the junction of the Mayfair &amp; Rossdorf RR and the Turvy Trunk Line. Springing up from the desert like a tumbleweed lies the eccentric little town of Rossdorf. Like most western towns, Rossdorf has a Land Agent: Guy Dough, the brother of that wicked varmint Black Benny. A shrewd opportunist, Guy's done sold all the town land ('ceptin' the outhouses) four times over! Every acre in town that ain't got an outhouse on it is owned by the miners, the railroads, AND the fort captain. Just about a year ago, miners digging in the shadow of Fort Rossdorf struck the mother lode! But it wasn't gold, and it wasn't silver. No, my friend, it was just a little spring. Not any ordinary spring, though! It was a torrent of that mind-marbling drink the locals call &quot;Wacky Water!&quot; <br/><br/><br/>Now that water's done what the sun and the wind couldn't do: it's made those landholders brave enough to take matters into their own hands. Now they'll use whatever means they can to bowl over the competition and lay claim to the only fertile spots left in town! Now the only thing stoppin' 'em is the Town Charter Amendment #5, which states: &quot;no landholder may move, remove, or detonate any outhouse without a majority vote of the Town Citizens...&quot; Now one thing's for sure: something's gonna stink in Rossdorf, purty darn soon.....<br/><br/><br/>In Wacky Wacky West you and your fellow townfolk place track tiles, street tiles, and river tiles hoping to destroy your rivals' buildings.

The scene is set in the ruins of a mighty kingdom, now inhabited by sparse groups of natives and swarms of monsters. Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map.<br/>To this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures.<br/><br/>As a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways.<br/><br/>MAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played.<br/>The complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects.<br/><br/>Between exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises.

Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.<br/><br/>Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris &amp; Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This &quot;ziggurat expansion&quot;, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.<br/><br/>Some versions of Tigris &amp; Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 3-4 players.

On a player's turn they must always first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the appropriate discard pile, and then draw one card. There is a separate discard pile for each color and a player may draw the top card of any discard pile or the top card of the deck. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.<br/><br/>The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the draw pile. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total. Expeditions start at a value of -20 so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least 8 cards played into it. The player with the most points wins the game, but it is typical to play 3 matches and add your score from each to see who wins.<br/><br/>Scoring example 1: an expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 minus the initial -20.<br/><br/>Scoring example 2: an expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, minus the initial 20, &times;3 for the 2 multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.<br/><br/>Scoring example 3: an expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 minus initial 20, &times;2 for the multiplier.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["999 Games Dutch edition 1999", "999 Games Dutch second edition 2013", "Albi Czech edition", "Devir edition 1999", "Devir Spanish/Portuguese edition 2006", "Devir Spanish/Portuguese edition 2015", "Filosofia French edition 2007", "Galakta Polish first edition", "Galakta Polish second edition", "Kaissa Greek edition 2001", "Kaissa Greek edition 2006", "Korea Boardgames Korean edition", "KOSMOS English edition 2014", "KOSMOS English edition 2015", "KOSMOS English second edition", "KOSMOS German edition 2015", "KOSMOS German first edition", "KOSMOS German fourth edition 2012", "KOSMOS German second edition", "KOSMOS German second edition 1999", "KOSMOS German third edition in tin", "KOSMOS/Rio Grande English first edition", "Laser Plus Slovenian edition", "Marektoy Finnish edition", "Midgaard Scandinavian edition 1999", "Piatnik Hungarian edition", "Playhouse Greek edition 2011", "Slovenian Third Edition", "Stupor Mundi Italian second edition", "Swan Chinese edition 2010", "Tilsit French edition 1999", "Tilsit Italian first edition", "Zvezda Russian edition 2007"], "average": "7.14637", "videogamebg": ["Lost Cities", "Lost Cities (iOS)"], "name": "Lost Cities", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Set Collection"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["206374"], "usersrated": "26504", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Archaeology", "Card Games: Draw and Discard Games", "Kosmos two-player series", "Lost Cities"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["#19: Viticulture on tap, Quadropolis &amp; TableTop Day", "#36: 2016, A Year in Review", "#39: Two Player Games six-pack; Citrus on tap; Isle of Skye &amp; Avenue", "BGA Ep 52 - 15 Predictions for 2015", "BGWS 007 \u2013 Lost Cities", "Cubepushers - Episode 4: Let the Nerd-Rage Flow", "Dukes of Dice - Ep. 63 - The Space Between", "Episode 16:City of Iron/Blue Peg Patrick Hot Seat", "Episode 1: Troyes, Willow, and Warhammer Quest", "Episode 7: Terra Mystica, Rambo: First Blood, and a Digital App Medley", "GameBreak Audio: Episode #009 - Fill-er Up!", "GenCon 2015 - Thames &amp; Kosmos", "If You Buy One Game - KOSMOS Two Player Series", "Il Giocatore - Episodio 4 - Juegos Introductorios", "Low Player Count - Ep. 6 - Mano a Mano: Co-op or Competitive", "Ludology Episode 78 - Here We Are Now, Entertain Us", "MN 0040 Two Player Games", "Podcast EP06 \u2013 Board Game Arena", "Podcast EP07 \u2013 Rentr\u00e9e 2016 et retour de voyage", "Podcast EP10 \u2013 Top 10 jeux de soci\u00e9t\u00e9", "What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing Week 81", "What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing Week 93!!"]}, "51": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1766273.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Micro Robots"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Alex Randolph"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1999", "maxplayers": "15", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamepublisher": ["ABACUSSPIELE", "Devir", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Hans im Gl\u00fcck Verlags-GmbH", "Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.", "Oya", "Playgo Hungary", "Rio Grande Games", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.", "Z-Man Games"], "boardgameintegration": ["Micro Robots", "Micro Robots"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1766273_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Maze", "Puzzle", "Real-time"], "description": "Ricochet Robots is less of a game and more of a puzzle, which explains why there's such an odd number of solutions possible.

The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).<br/><br/>A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.<br/><br/>The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["999 Games Dutch edition", "Anv\u00e4ndbart Litet F\u00f6retag Swedish First Edition", "Descartes French Edition", "Gabinete Ludico Spanish Edition 2012", "Hans im Gl\u00fcck Danish First Edition", "Hans im Gl\u00fcck German First Edition", "Hans im Gl\u00fcck German SdJ Edition", "Hans im Gl\u00fcck German Second Edition", "Rio Grande English First Edition"], "average": "7.80548", "name": "El Grande", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Area Movement", "Auction/Bidding", "Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Memory", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["583", "597", "3146", "370", "5754", "27759"], "usersrated": "18317", "boardgameaccessory": ["El Grande: English Cards"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Spain", "El Grande"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BGA Episode 100 - Top 100 Games of All Time", "BGTG - April 16, 2005 (Game of the Month)", "BGTG 112 - Five-Player Games (with Dave O'Connor)", "Cubepushers - Episode 4: Let the Nerd-Rage Flow", "DdJ 029.

In these instances the Boarding Parties portion comes into play.  Here players line up their ships next to one another and attempt to storm the other ship and kill the opposing captain.

Take It Easy is a true multi-player solitaire in which each player individually completes a hexagon-shaped board with spots for 19 hexagon tiles. There's no limit to number of players if you've got enough sets on hand. One person (the caller) draws a tile randomly and tells the others which of the 27 tiles featuring colored/numbered lines crossing in three directions, with numbers from 1 to 9, it is. &quot;The 9-8-7,&quot; for example. Each player then chooses which empty spot on his own board he'll play the 9-8-7. This is repeated until the boards are filled.<br/><br/>The idea is to complete same-numbered lines across your board. Scoring is calculated by multiplying the number on the tile with the number of tiles in the completed line. A complete column of three 9s is worth 27, for example...but a lot of players will hope for five 9s to fill the big column down the middle.<br/><br/>Take It Easy is often compared to Bingo because of the familiar pattern of a number being called and then everybody looking at their cards to play it, and then scoring if a line is completed. But that's as far as the comparison goes.

The first edition in 1903 had a deck of 63 cards, 9 each of 7 commodities, each with a value (ranging from 40 for Flax to 100 for Wheat). Players offer trades by crying out the number of cards they want to swap (&ldquo;One! One! One!&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Three! Three! Three!&rdquo;) but not their identity. The winner of the hand is the first to collect all of one commodity, declaring &ldquo;Corner on Wheat!&rdquo; or whatever commodity has been collected. The winner of the hand scores points equal to the value of the commodity, and the winner of the game is the first to 500 points.<br/><br/>The 1904 Edition of Pit added much fancier artwork and the famous Bull and Bear cards, which provide wild-card and penalty features. The early editions allowed a maximum of 7 players, but later versions supported 8 and in at least one case up to 10.<br/><br/>Pit&rsquo;s designer, noted psychic Edgar Cayce, is often accused of having stolen the idea from the game Gavitt&rsquo;s Stock Exchange (G-S-E) invented by Harry Gavitt. While G-S-E claimed patents dating as early as 1896, it involved trading railway shares, and was only copyrighted and published in 1903, the same year as Pit. Also hitting the market in 1903 was Bourse, a remarkably similar open-outcry commodity trading game from Flinch Card Co., using an 80-card deck with 10 each of 8 commodities.  Pit, however, seems to have cornered the market on open-outcry games, as neither of its competitors were seen again after 1904.<br/><br/>Printings:<br/><br/>    Parker Brothers (1903-???)<br/>    Out of the Box Publishing (2004-Present)<br/>    Winning Moves Games (USA)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Microbadges<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["Clipper Dutch/French edition", "Crown & Andrews edition 1984", "Crown & Andrews Edition 2000", "Crown & Andrews edition 2006", "Crown & Andrews English edition", "Dutch version", "Editrice Giochi Italian edition 1988", "Fundex edition 2009", "Gavitt Publishing and Printing edition 1903", "Grimaud French edition 1978", "Holdson edition", "In the Morning edition 2011", "Nordic Games edition 2010", "Out of the Box Anniversary Edition 2003", "Parker British edition in red box", "Parker Bros.

Complete a delivery and make the money you need to buy larger, faster trains, and expand your railroad empire.  Win the game by building the most effective railroad empire!<br/><br/>The original and flagship of Mayfair's crayon-rails line allows players, using washable crayons, to draw their train routes over a map of North America.  Players start with an initial sum of money which they use to build short lengths of track during their first couple of turns.  For the rest of the game, players operate their trains over the track network drawn on the board to pick up and deliver loads to various cities, and then have the opportunity to add to their track network or improve their train.  The game uses demand cards which list three demands, each of a commodity to be delivered to a specified city for a given payoff.  Each player has three demand cards to provide opportunities for income.<br/><br/>Each turn consists of an operations phase and a building phase.  During the operations phase, trains are moved to cities where commodities are picked up at no cost and moved to one of the cities on that player's demand cards.  When the commodity is delivered, the player receives the payoff and trades that demand card for a new one.  Event cards are mixed in the deck with the demand cards.  When an event card is drawn the instructions are followed.  During the building phase a player may pay to build more track or upgrade his train.<br/><br/>A player wins by being the first to connect his track network to six of the seven major cities on the board and acquire $250,000,000 in cash on hand.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition 1988 in grey box", "English first edition 1982", "English fourth edition 2004 with Canada and Mexico", "English revised fifth edition 2008", "English second edition 1984", "English third edition 1996", "English third edition 1999 with 'New Edition Now Contains Mexico'"], "average": "6.91761", "name": "Empire Builder", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Area Enclosure", "Crayon Rail System", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Route/Network Building"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["30889", "71082", "68119", "124304"], "usersrated": "2475", "boardgameaccessory": ["Empire Builder pewter miniatures", "Empire Builder: Laminated Flat Map"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: USA", "Empire Builder Rail Games"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BGTG 133 - 100 Great Games, part 2 (with Stephen Glenn and Mark Jackson)", "Episode 31 - Top 50, Picks 40-31", "Ludology Episode 76 - I Like Dice To Roll", "PGGK 033: Empire Builder", "Scythe - Episode 042", "The Vintage Gamer #17: Empire Builder (BG)"]}, "169": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic620883.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Duell"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Reiner Knizia"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1993", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Pier\u00f4"], "boardgamepublisher": ["ABACUSSPIELE", "Eagle-Gryphon Games", "Ferti", "New Games Order, LLC"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic620883_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Sports"], "boardgamehonor": ["1993 Fairplay \u00c0 la carte Winner"], "description": "Experience the thrill of fencing&mdash; board game style!

Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws. Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typicially featuring games and commentary by chess masters.<br/><br/>The current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from a similar, much older game of Indian origin. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886. The current World Champion is Magnus Carlsen, Norway.

But once its basic rules are understood, Go shows its staggering depth. One can see why many people say it's one of the most elegant brain-burning abstract games in history, with players trying to claim territory by walling off sections of the board and surrounding each other's stones.  The game doesn't end until the board fills up, or, more often, when both players agree to end it, at which time whoever controls the most territory wins.<br/><br/>The earliest mention of Go (\u570d\u68cb (w&eacute;i q&iacute;)- &quot;surrounding game&quot;) appears in the &quot;Analects&quot; of Confucius (551-479 BC), while the earliest physical evidence is a 17&times;17 Go board discovered in 1952 in a tomb of the former Han dynasty (206 BC- 9 AD). There is a tangle of conflicting popular and scholarly anecdotes attributing its invention to two Chinese emperors, an imperial vassal and court astrologers. One story has it that Go was invented by the legendary Emperor Yao (ruled 2357-2256 BC) as an amusement for his idiot son. A second claims that the Emperor Shun (ruled 2255-2205 BC) created the game in hopes of improving his weak-minded son's mental prowess. A third says the person named Wu, a vassal of the Emperor Jie (ruled 1818-1766 BC), invented Go (as well as games of cards). Finally, a fourth story suggests that Go was developed by court astrologers during the Zhou dynasty (1045-255 BC).<br/><br/>A Go set, consisting of a very general-purpose grid and colored stones, can also be used to play a variety of other abstract strategy games, such as  Connect6, Go-Moku, Pente, and others.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["3M Bookshelf Edition", "Alga Orange Spotted Robe Edition", "Ariel British Edition", "Avalon Hill Bookshelf edition", "Barnes and Noble English edition", "Borras Red Edition", "Carlton second edition by Matthew Macfadyen", "Cathay Magnetic edition", "Cayro Juegos Spanish edition", "Crisloid Mounted Samurai Edition", "Drueke Intellectual Edition", "Dujardin French Edition", "Dynamic Games Edition 1974", "E.S.

Individual pieces of a set are worthless at game's end, but are able to be sold during the course of the game in order to provide a cash-flow.<br/><br/>These 'properties' are represented on cards. There are 12 different types of properties, varying from 3 - 6 pieces per set. Naturally, the sets containing six pieces are much more valuable than the sets containing only three pieces as it is much more difficult to complete these larger sets.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt six cards and given a starting 'fund' of $2,000. The top 'property' card is revealed and a bidding ensues. The winner pays the bank and takes the card into his hand. The player then has the option of selling 1 - 3 properties to the bank. The idea here is to rid yourself of properties that you do not wish to collect and provide a source of income.<br/><br/>There is danger, however. The sales price is determined randomly via the roll of two dice. The price can vary from 25% - 100% of the listed worth of the item. Further, if a '0' is rolled on one of the dice, then the item is NOT sold outright, but rather an auction takes place amongst the players. This can result in a substantially reduced price to the seller, or a higher price, depending upon the demand for the item. Further, it is quite possible that no one desires the item, so the seller must take the item back into his hand. There is also the possibility that the player will earn a $200 bonus if the proper digit is rolled on one of the dice.<br/><br/>When a property is sold, it is placed on the appropriate section of the 'board' - 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% (there really isn't a board, just a card holder that indicates these sections). After a player sells properties, he may surrender one of the special 'buyer' cards and purchase from 1 - 3 cards from one of these markets. The player must pay the indicated price (based on the particular percentage market where the property is located) and take the property into his hand.<br/><br/>Again, there is a decision to be made here. Buyer cards are very valuable, as they can be used in a number of fashions:<br/><br/>1) Purchase properties, as described above;<br/><br/>2) Used as a 'wild' card to complete a set; or<br/><br/>3) Valued as $500.00 at the end of the game.<br/><br/>So, a player has to weigh the advantages of each of these options and play accordingly.<br/><br/>Buyer cards are purchases at auction in conjunction with a property card. When a Buyer card is revealed, another card is then revealed, and both cards are then auctioned together.

In your turn, you can either place a tile in your pub, representing different types of seating (bar, patio, formal) &amp; activities (dancing, shooting pool, playing fooseball), or you can select a customer card, to draw in customers to those specific tiles, if you have the seating available. A third choice is to take a Billing card, which gives you a tip in cash money, and makes all customers in all the players bars pay their bills too. Yellow customers are worth 10 DM, red 20 DM and blue customers pay 30 DM.<br/><br/>When there are at least ten customers floating around, players can also spend a Action card which moves customers around. The cards either move off a specific tile type to a type you choose, or from a tile type you choose to a specific tile. So you might move customers specifically from the terrace seating to any other type of your choice (such as the disco floor), or from a tile of your choice (such as the bar) to specifically a Pool Table. The cards allow from 1-4 customers to move, depending on the tiles.<br/><br/>This is the clever part. As the customers move, they normally pay their bill, unless the Action card shows a No Pay symbol, making them bill-dodgers. When customers move, they first look for a suitable spot within the same pub! Only if they can't find one (either it lacks that type of tile, or there isn't enough room to accommodate them), do they then start wandering clockwise to the next pub, and keep going until they find a suitable spot. If they can't, they leave the game.<br/><br/>So if you have an Action card that pays a bill, and you have the right empty spaces in your bar (because you've carefully put in a variety of attractions), you move your customers around inside your bar and collect the money (&quot;Hey, we're paying our bar tab now, we're gonna shoot some Pool&quot;). If you have a suitable Action card with a No Pay symbol, you move customers from another player's bar into yours (&quot;This place stinks guys, let's skip out and find a Fooseball!&quot;). It is this clever management of customers that will net you big profits.<br/><br/>And if your bar is pretty full, especially with blue and red customers, you call a billing as your first action. The other players also collect, but you should have a margin on them, plus the tip (from 30-70 DM).<br/><br/>There are always three Customer cards and three Action cards face up, and two fresh tiles, so you should be able to make good choices and plan ahead a little. The game ends when the Action cards or the Billing cards are exhausted.<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the most money, having milked the punters as much as possible.<br/><br/>"}, "220": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1513386.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Reiner Knizia"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1995", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Mateusz Bielski", "Wesly Gibs", "Alvin Madden", "Ulf Marckwort", "Paul Niemeyer", "Bj\u00f6rn Pertoft", "Markus Wagner"], "boardgamepublisher": ["AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH", "Eagle-Gryphon Games", "Foxgames (Poland)", "Kanga Games", "Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH", "\u00dcberplay", "University Games", "Wargames Club Publishing"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1513386_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "boardgamehonor": ["1995 Fairplay \u00c0 la carte Winner"], "description": "In Reiner Knizia's High Society, players bid against each other to acquire the various trappings of wealth (positive-number and multiplier cards) while avoiding its pitfalls (negative number and divisor cards).

Player forces include provincial forces in the provinces and mobile armies commanded by daimyos.  In each turn, players will allocate their koku into bids and purchases for the round.  The round begins with the allocation of turn order, which is determined by bid, and in the case of tied bids, by player agreement or random draw.  Then players other bids and payments are accounted for in purchases of castles and fortresses, drafting of new troops and ronin, and a bid for the lone ninja.  Following the bids phase, players in turn order plan and execute attacks against enemy territories, with attacks resolved through die rolls.  A player wins the game when he or she has captured a certain number of territories, either via straight conquest or by vanquishing the last of an opponent's diamyos and taking over that player's forces.<br/><br/>The game was originally published as Shogun and was later changed to Samurai Swords due to a name conflict with James Clavell's Shogun.

The game is played out over 7 epochs or rounds, from the ancient 3000 B.C. Sumerians to the pre-WW1 Germany, with every player controlling a new rising empire from history.  Some empires are stronger than others (like the Romans), but the game's clever mechanisms can help balance that out.  At the end of each epoch, players score points for all units of their color (from both the current and any previous empires) remaining on the board.<br/><br/>Gameplay:  Each player selects a color and takes all pieces of that color, as there are different miniatures for each of the 7 Epochs, these should be sorted by Epoch.  The game board is a stylized version of the globe.  The Event cards should be separated into Greater and Lesser Events.  Each player is dealt 3 Greater Events. These are either Minor Empires, Leaders, Weaponry or Reallocation.  Each player is also dealt 7 Lesser Events.  There are 22 different types of Lesser Events (Disasters, Diseases, and Special abilities, to name a few).  Players roll 2 dice and determine first player and begin drawing their first Epoch empires.  One unique mechanism is that the drawing player can examine their drawn empire and decide whether to keep it for themselves or give it to another player who hasn't gotten one yet.  If it is given to another player, the receiving player has no choice but to keep it for himself to play that Epoch.  Then the next player draws and makes his decision.  The player who gives their drawn Empire has to wait until given an empire by another player or until the last player draws.  Each Empire card contains the Empire name, how many troops the Empire has for expansion, the Empire's starting land space, if it has a Capitol or not (barbarian or nomadic nations frequently do not) and if it has any Navigation (Seas and Oceans to travel by).  One player reads out the Epochs Empires in order and turns are taken, in this roughly historical order, when a player's Empire is called.<br/><br/>Before the start of their turn a player may play up to two Event cards from their hand.  The Events played are resolved before the player starts his Empire's actions.  If the player's active Empire has navigation a ship token is placed in each sea or ocean listed (if an ocean is listed all adjacent seas to the ocean have ship markers put into them).  A Reallocation Greater Event allows an Empire with Navigation to exchange Fleets in seas and oceans for Coins that can be used to buy back defeated troops (1 coin per troop).  If the active Empire has a capitol it is taken and placed in the Empire's starting land with one unit of the Empire's available troops.<br/><br/>Since each land space may only contain one troop the player begins expanding from their starting land by placing troops in any adjacent land space that they wish to occupy or conquer.  To conquer a land the attacker moves one unit into the land space either from adjacent land or through a sea with a ship in it.  Then dice are rolled, the attacker gets 2 dice and the defender only one, unless the attacker traveled across a strait or the defender's land has either a forest, the great wall of China, or mountains on the border of the land that the attacker came from.  In this case the defender receives 2 dice as well.  If the attack comes from the sea the defender gets 3 dice for defense.  Highest score wins with ties killing off both the defender and attacker.  In this case the attacker can merely place the next troop, if he has any left, in the now-empty land space.<br/><br/>At any time the active Empire player may exchange an unplaced troop for a fort.  On later turns, a fort gives the player a +1 to defensive rolls in that land.  Also, if the defender in a fort loses or ties with an attacker only the fort is removed and the battle continues.  Whenever an army conquers a land with a capitol the capitol mini is flipped reducing it to a city (if it was a city to begin with it is removed from board when conquered).  After the active player's Empire is finished with it's actions check to see if it conquered to land spaces with resource symbols, if so it can build a monument.<br/><br/>Then scoring takes place.  Each area (Middle-East, Northern Europe, Eurasia, etc...) has a tile with 3 values for the current Epoch.  One value is for having a presence in the area (at least one land).  Another value is for having Dominance in the area (at least 2 lands and more than any other player in area). The last value is for having Control of an area (at least 3 lands and no other player has any in area).  These values vary from Epoch to Epoch and Area to Area (Middle-East is more valuable in early Epochs and fades in later Epochs, for example).  Total the scores from each area for all pieces of the player's color from all Empires controlled that remain on board.  Then add 2 points for each capitol controlled, 1 point per city and one point for each monument controlled. After all areas are scored the next Empire called takes its turn.<br/><br/>After all players have taken their turns and scored, for the first Epoch, the player with the highest score gets to take a pre-eminence marker and places it in front of him.  These are secret bonus points (worth somewhere from 3 to 6) for the end of the game and may not be examined till then.  This bonus to leader helps balance the Empire-draw mechanic and makes it valuable to score maximal points even early in the game, rather than tanking to get a better draw later. Then drawing begins for the next Epoch with the player having the lowest score drawing first on up to the person with the highest score drawing last (and likely being given a less than optimal Empire by another player).<br/><br/>Victory: After the last player has scored for Epoch 7 and the leader has drawn a pre-eminence marker, all players reveal their pre-eminence markers and add them to their scores.  The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>    <a target='_blank' href='http://gamesbyemail.com' rel='nofollow'>http://gamesbyemail.com</a> (English, turn-based)<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["Avalon Hill edition", "Avalon Hill/Hasbro edition", "Compendium Games Dutch edition", "Compendium Games English edition 1992", "Gibsons Games edition", "Ragnar Brothers First edition", "Welt der Spiele German edition"], "name": "History of the World", "videogamebg": ["History of the World"], "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "3957", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games", "Thematic Games"], "average": "7.13039", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 21: Above and Below Review - Kevin Wilson Interview", "I\u2019ve Been Diced! episode 52: Steve Kendall of Ragnar Brothers", "Show # 9: History of the World -and- Pizza Box Football"]}, "225": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2038742.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["John Cooper", "Andrew Looney"], "statistics": [], "boardgamecompilation": ["Playing With Pyramids"], "yearpublished": "1989", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgamepublisher": ["Crystal Caste", "IcehouseGames", "Looney Labs"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2038742_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Game System", "Real-time"], "description": "This is the game that introduced Icehouse Pieces.

The Mediterranean was a sea of great prosperity - the only route between East and West. The greatest fleets of the age battled for the most lucrative trade routes.<br/><br/>Trade cities like Venice, Genoa, Barcelona or Istanbul grew as powerful as whole nations, establishing trade routes as far as North Africa or Middle East, bringing back Spice, Gems or Gold to the western Mediterranean. SERENISSIMA recreates this era, when the Mediterranean was at the centre of world trade.<br/><br/>The Game<br/><br/>Each players assume the role of one of those four city-states. Their goal is to establish their sphere of influence in the Mediterranean, and share all sorts of commodities to make their trading empire the most prosperous. In the course of a game, players must build galleys, hire crew and buy/sell commodities. The value of goods can be influenced by players having monopolies in certain commodities. Players can also take control of ports, thereby earning extra income from players using the port, as well as being able to get this port's specific commodity.<br/><br/>In the end, the scoring is based on the number of ports each player control, but also on the fact that those ports have commodities of different kind available. Ports come in three types : small, medium, and city-states. Whereas small ports are quite easy to satisfy (they need only two commodities to be considered &quot;full&quot;), the four starting city-states are far more difficult to please, as they will need all kind of commodities available (6 additional commodities, plus the one they produce).<br/><br/>During the course of the game, the number and type of commodities available in ports also controls the number of crew members you can hire, if you can build galleys or forts, and the price of commodities when you sell them. For example, a player won't be able to build new galleys until they have wood and iron available in one of the ports they control. Once a galley has been built, it has 5 spaces available, that can be filled by the crew or the goods. Every crew member allows movement through one space, and makes the galley more powerful. But those spaces are also needed to carry the goods that are worth money. Money that can be used to hire new crews, build new galleys, or commodities. A balance thus needs to be struck between trading commodities and taking control of ports - between a fleet of merchant galleys and a fleet of warships.<br/><br/>The game lasts between 5 to 8 turns depending on the number of active players. Turn order is defined by bidding. The winner of the bid choose whether he will play first, second, third or last. Depending on the situation and what the player wants to do, playing first or last might be equally interesting. For example, by playing first, a player would be unable to react to other players move, but he could avoid having his galleys blockaded.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch edition", "English edition", "French edition", "German edition", "German edition with DSP logo", "Italian edition"], "average": "6.89184", "name": "Serenissima (first edition)", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pick-up and Deliver", "Trading"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "2089", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Cities: Barcelona (Spain)", "Cities: Genova", "Cities: Marseille", "Cities: Naples", "Cities: Venice"]}, "234": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3477797.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Mark Simonitch"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1996", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Joe Amoral", "Mike Doyle (I)", "Rick Gondeck", "Pawe\u0142 Kaczmarczyk", "Kurt Miller", "Mark Simonitch", "Rafal Szymanski", "Piotr S\u0142aby"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Valley Games, Inc.", "Avalon Hill", "Descartes Editeur", "Hobby World", "PHALANX", "Phalanx Games Deutschland", "Smart Ltd"], "maxplaytime": "200", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3477797_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "40", "boardgamecategory": ["Ancient", "Political", "Wargame"], "boardgamehonor": ["2008 Golden Geek Best 2-Player Board Game Nominee", "2008 Golden Geek Best 2-Player Board Game Winner", "2008 Golden Geek Best Wargame Nominee", "2008 Golden Geek Best Wargame Winner", "2008 JoTa Best 2-Player Board Game Nominee", "2008 JoTa Best Wargame Nominee"], "description": "This game uses the very popular card system which first appeared in Avalon Hill's We the People game to detail the struggle between Carthage's Hannibal and the Roman Republic in approximately 200 BC.<br/><br/><br/>(from Valley Games website:)<br/><br/>One of the greatest military commanders and tacticians in history descends on the Roman Empire once again.

This set of rules is constantly kept up to date by expansions included with the modules.<br/><br/>ASL goals are scenario-defined, and vary from tasks such as exiting troops off of one edge of the board, to inflicting a certain number of casualty points on the opposing force, to capturing a certain number of goal buildings or areas.<br/><br/>This is just the rulebook. To start playing the game the newcomer must get, at least, the Beyond Valor: ASL Module 1. There are a great many ASL Modules available. &quot;Core Modules&quot; provide additional rules, units from different nationalities, and additional geomorphic mapboards. &quot;Historical Modules&quot; provide campaign games simulating multi-day battles using actual historical maps rather than geomorphic mapboards, including additional rules, counters, and paper maps. Many modules have dependencies on earlier modules.<br/><br/>Rulebook contents:<br/><br/>    Introduction<br/>    Chapters A, B, C, D, H (Design Your Own, German &amp; Russian vehicle notes only), J [1st edition]<br/>    Chapters A, B, C, D, E, H (Design Your Own, German &amp; Russian vehicle notes only), J, K [2nd edition]<br/>    Index &amp; Glossary<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>1st edition additional changes/chapters:<br/><br/>    chapter E in Yanks: ASL Module 3<br/>    chapter F in West of Alamein: ASL Module 5<br/>    chapter G in Code of Bushido: ASL Module 8 / Gung Ho!: ASL Module 9<br/>    chapter K in Paratrooper: ASL Module 2<br/>    8 revised RuleBook pages  [A 17-18/A 29-30/B 31-32/F 1-2 all marked &quot;92&quot;] in Croix de Guerre: ASL Module 10<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>2nd edition additional chapters:<br/><br/>    chapter G in Rising Sun: ASL Module 13<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>[Note: this is a description of the ASL rulebook.
