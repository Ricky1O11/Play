It was first released on the Family Computer (known internationally as the Nintendo Entertainment System) on November 20, 1990. It takes place on the continent of Archanea. It stars Marth, a character who later became better known for his appearance in Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Smash Bros. Brawl. The Falchion weapon from this game acts as the Fire Emblem franchise's symbol in the Super Smash Bros. series. Shiida appeared in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as a Sticker.<br/><br/>Fire Emblem was one of the earliest series in the turn-based strategy genre on home consoles. However, unlike other strategy games, it borrowed several elements from role-playing games such as Dragon Quest, and is among the first games, if not the first, in the tactical role-playing genre. Later games in the series made numerous changes to the gameplay.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Fire Emblem: Ankoku Ry\u016b to Hikari no Tsurugi&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "75006": {"poll": [], "name": "Commander Keen (GBC)", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US Game Boy Color edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2829032.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Commander Keen"], "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction", "Space"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["David A.

He was not a particularly good King, but he was not evil either. He had reigned for many years, and his kingdom had prospered. The peasants and merchants were content with his laws, the nobility swayed by his charisma and generalship, the priests approving of his piety - in short, the kingdom was a happy place, where almost everyone could live in comfort, if not joy.<br/><br/>One year, the King fell ill. It was long, decades even, after he had ascended to the throne. His children had all grown and learned, and they had gone their separate ways in the world. The best doctors and leeches were called to try their art, but the King's condition only grew worse. One by one, the healers gave up; eventually, only a few remained to take care of him.<br/><br/>Finally, they decided that the King was not long for this life. His courtiers remained worried and eagerly requested news of his health; but he lay dying still. The sages and physicians who attended him said, &quot;He has but one week to live.&quot; They had no hope of stopping whatever ailed him.<br/><br/>Worried, the King's advisros and councillors said to the King, &quot;You must choose a successor before the week is out, or we shall be without a ruler and the kingdom will be plunged into civil war.&quot; So they brought all the King's children to the palace.<br/><br/>The royal abode had been a merry place, warm, lit with cheery torches and draped in colorful banners and flags; but now it was cold and dreary. The torches were extinguished, replaced by small, flickering candles; the banners had been removed in mourning, leaving only the dank stone. Heavy grey curtains shrouded the windows, obscuring almost all the sunlight. The King was dying, and it seemed all his retainers wished to follow him.<br/><br/>At last, calling his children to his bedside, the King explained his plan for succession. &quot;I have not yet decided upon an heir. Upon the last day of the week, I will make my choice. Until then, all of you, show that you are worthy of my crown.&quot; He sent for a quill, ink, and a piece of parchment, and wrote a short list upon it, giving it to his hreald to read to the children later.<br/><br/>Then he dismissed them.<br/><br/><br/>This is the story of the King's children, and how they spent that week.

Actraiser unusually combines the elements of both a side scrolling platformer with a civilisation builder game.<br/><br/>In Actraiser you are The Master, a god-like being that awakes to find mankind on the brink of extinction. Using your Cherub-like Herald you go down to Earth where you discover evil has spread across the land and monsters are everywhere. You must rid the land of evil, help the broken remains of mankind flourish and destroy the source of evil once and for all!<br/><br/>Each section of the Actraiser's Story Mode comprises of two distinct parts. The first is a side scrolling platformer in which you as The Master descend to Earth and take the form of a human Warrior.  You must make your way through the level, navigating past traps and battling past enemies to an end of level boss who must be defeated. The second part of each section is an overhead civilisation builder in which you control your Herald and help the local human settlement flourish by directing them to build roads and destroy monster spawn points. You must also use the weather to carve and shape the land, fight off the invading monsters until their lairs are destroyed, and solve problems that the people encounter as they advance.<br/><br/>Actraiser was subject to some controversy upon its release due to its strong religious subtext. The Master as you are often referred to is quite clearly a God (if not supposed to be THE God), and several bosses resemble monsters and gods of other religions such as those in Greek Mythology and Hinduism. In the Japanese version of the game you are actually referred to as 'God', and the final boss Tanzra is referred to as 'Satan'. Nintendo America took the liberty to change the names to The Master and Tanzra for fear of causing offence to gamers, although much of the other subtext is still present.<br/><br/>Actraiser was considered a critical success, and gained several rewards including Best Game Music of 1993 and appeared in several Top SNES Games Lists around the world.<br/><br/>It spawned the sequel ActRaiser 2 also released in 1993. This sequel dropped the civilisation builder aspect of the game making it more of a standard platformer.<br/><br/>The game Soul Blazer can also be considered a sister game to Actraiser, as it was not only made by the same company Enix but features many similar aspects, including a Herald or Avatar sent down to Earth by The Master to rid the world of evil, enemy spawn points and having to solve the problems of men and creatures as you restore populated areas. Unlike Actraiser it is an RPG style game similar to The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.<br/><br/>"}, "75032": {"poll": [], "name": "Old Navy Shop-Opoly", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Set Collection", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Monopoly"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic759880_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Late for the Sky Production Company"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic759880.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Negotiation"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "The game where shopping is fun again.

Since the beginning of civilization there has been government, from the primitive tribal chieftain to the modern day heads of state. Where there is government, there exists a need for &quot;information&quot; or &quot;intelligence&quot;. Just as kings in ancient days sent forth scouts to observe the movements of enemy armies and had their spies mingle with high society and royalty in other nations to gain information. Governments of today employ high technology and age old techniques to keep one step ahead of the enemy. <br/>Amid media reports and government propaganda the average citi-zen is oblivious to the &quot;truth&quot;. The fact is, most of us suspect things arent as they present themselves to be. We know more than we are willing to admit. Conspiracies abound; no longer are battles fought only on land, air and sea. Now the governments and syndicates of the Earth are engaged in a war of lies and secrets.<br/><br/>You are no longer part of the unknowing masses. You are an &quot;Agent of Influence&quot;, sworn to uphold the law and at the same time protect the secrets of a horribly corrupt system. However, you can only be a part of the corruption and deceit for so long, before it becomes a part of you and you are faced with the question...Whose side are you on?<br/><br/>ABOUT ROLE PLAYING GAMES If you are familiar with Role-Playing Games, then you will slide into the role of an Agent quite nicely. Although most gamers will recognize AGENT X as another Role-Playing Game (RPG) we prefer to use the term &quot;Interactive Literature&quot; when describing what AGENT X actually is.<br/><br/>The first form of AGENT X is the &quot;sit down&quot; or &quot;tabletop&quot; game. Players sit around the table and use little more than their imagination to explore the world that the Director (sometimes called the Game Master) has laid before them.<br/><br/>The second form of AGENT X is the Live-Interactive Literature form of the game, which is known in the gaming world as a LARP (Live Action Role Playing) Game. In the LIL, you come dressed as your character and interact with other players much like you would in an Improvisational Theater environment. AGENT X is unique in that you can play either form without a change in rules.<br/><br/>THE DIRECTOR The role of the Director, in AGENT X, is much like that of the game master or storyteller, in other role-playing games. The primary difference is that the Director not only officiates the but also takes the role of the Director of the agency that the players represent, giving her an active role in the game.<br/><br/>However, during live-action, or LARP, play Assistant Directors work with the Director in setting up scenes and scenarios, acting as NPCs (non-player characters), keeping the plot moving and resolving conflict and combat situations.<br/><br/>"}, "75037": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Geckopoly", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Set Collection", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Monopoly"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic762838_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Late for the Sky Production Company"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic762838.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Late for the Sky 70th Anniversary Edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Negotiation"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Geico Insurance, the company known for its great rates, superior service, and, of course, its talkative gecko mascot, created this custom game to reward its agents for meeting and exceeding sales goals.

Kidou Senshi Gandamu Gaiden: Koroni no Ochichita Chide...) is a video game that was released for the Dreamcast. It is based in the Universal Century timeline of the popular Mobile Suit Gundam franchise. It was developed and published by Bandai. It takes place in Australia, following an elite squad of RGM-79 GMs (known as the &quot;White Dingo&quot; squad) who are charged with various missions pertaining to the attacks by the Duchy of Zeon.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>This game is notable amongst Mobile Suit Gundam games for allowing the player to pilot the large &quot;mobile suits&quot; in the game from a cockpit view, like its predecessor, Mobile Suit Gundam Side Story: The Blue Destiny, as opposed to the third-person viewpoint employed in games such as Federation vs Zeon DX. It also requires the player to employ team-tactics with their (usually 3-man) team - these teammates are computer-controlled.<br/><br/>The player could normally choose from two mobile suits, the standard RGM-79 GM, a decent all around mobile suit, or the heavier RGC-80 GM Cannon, a mobile suit with a cannon attached to its shoulder. If a certain mission was completed successfully, a third type of mobile suit the RX-77D Mass-Production Type, a heavy mobile suit with dual cannons on its shoulders, and a machine gun in each hand, could be unlocked.<br/><br/>The very last mission of the game put the player in the cockpit of the RGM-79SP GM Sniper II , a heavily customized white and blue painted unit. It was the ultimate of the suits available for this game.<br/><br/>The game consisted of 9 stages, bringing you all around Australia in an attempt to stop Zeon from developing and releasing Astaroth, a biological weapon capable of accelerating the growth of plant life on the Earth, turning it into an uninhabitable forest.<br/><br/>After completing the game, the player could open up an &quot;Extra Options&quot; menu with customizable &quot;cheats&quot; like Lunar Titanium Alloy (larger health bar) or certain weapons, like the Prototype Beam Rifle used in the GAW Assault Carrier mission.<br/><br/>"}, "75059": {"poll": [], "name": "Bushido Blade", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European PlayStation edition", "EU Playstation release", "JP Legendary Hits version", "JP PS3 \"PSOne Classics\" version", "JP version", "US version"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic781051.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Bushido Blade"], "videogametheme": ["Martial Arts"], "usersrated": "48", "videogamedeveloper": ["LightWeight"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation", "PlayStation 3"], "videogamehonor": ["1998 D.I.C.E.

The game features one-on-one armed combat. Its name refers to the Japanese code of honor, Bushid\u014d.<br/><br/>Upon its release, the realistic fighting system in Bushido Blade was seen as quite innovative. A direct sequel, Bushido Blade 2, was released on the PlayStation a year later. Another game with a related title and gameplay, Kengo: Master of Bushido, was also developed by Light Weight for the PlayStation 2.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The bulk of the gameplay in Bushido Blade revolves around one-on-one third-person battles between two opponents. Unlike most fighting games, however, no time limit or health gauge is present during combat. Most hits will cause instant death, where traditional fighting games required many hits to deplete an opponents health gauge. It is possible to wound an opponent without killing them. With the game's &quot;Body Damage System,&quot; opponents are able to physically disable each other in increments with hits from an equipped weapon, slowing their attacking and running speed, or crippling their legs forcing them to crawl. Notably, the North American release of Bushido Blade had one minor graphical change: blood was added, replacing the yellow flash that appears during a fatal blow.<br/><br/>The game features eight weapons to choose from in many of its modes, including katana, nodachi, long sword, saber, broadsword, naginata, rapier, and sledgehammer. Each weapon has a realistic weight and length, giving each one fixed power, speed, and an ability to block. A variety of attack combinations can be executed by the player using button sequences with the game's &quot;Motion Shift System,&quot; where one swing of a weapon is followed through with another. Many of these attacks are only available in one of three stances, switched using the shoulder buttons: high, neutral, and low. The player also has a choice of one out of six playable characters. Similar to the weapons, each one has a different level of strength and speed, and a number of unique special attacks. Some characters have a subweapon that can be thrown as well. All the characters have differing levels of proficiency with the selectable weapons and have a single preferred weapon.<br/><br/>Characters in Bushido Blade also have the ability to run, jump, and climb within the 3D environments. Because battles are not limited to small arenas, the player is encouraged to freely explore during battle. The castle compound which most of the game takes place in acts as a large hub area of interconnected smaller areas including a cherry blossom grove, a moat, and a bridge labyrinth. Some areas, such as the bamboo thicket, allow some interaction.<br/><br/>"}, "75060": {"poll": [], "name": "Bushido Blade 2", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["JP Legendary Hits version", "JP PS3 \"PSOne Classics\" version", "JP version", "US version"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic840442.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Bushido Blade"], "videogametheme": ["Martial Arts"], "usersrated": "24", "videogamedeveloper": ["LightWeight"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation", "PlayStation 3"], "videogamehonor": ["1999 D.I.C.E.

It is the sequel to Bushido Blade, which had been released the previous year.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Bushido Blade 2 expands on some of the aspects of Bushido Blade, while limiting or removing others. The story mode is changed from one large connected level to a series of skirmishes, each set on a different map. Playable characters are chosen from groups which represent two opposing schools of assassins, and they are armed with swords or polearms of varying types.<br/><br/>The fights in Bushido Blade 2 mark the progress of the chosen character who&mdash;depending on the character&mdash;either fights to regain a legendary sword, or to destroy the opposing school. Levels involve a pattern of fighting several generic ninja followed by a boss, who is one of the playable characters from the opposing school.<br/><br/>Two characters in Bushido Blade 2 are exceptions to the typical opponent roster: the gun-wielding Tsubame and Katze. They have sworn loyalty to opposing schools, and battles involving them provide a different, arguably greater kind of challenge. With proper tactics, such as monitoring the opponent's remaining ammunition, however, the player can defend against the firearms with his melee weapons.<br/><br/>"}, "75061": {"poll": [], "name": "Mousetrap Maths", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2005", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Mice"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3036797_t.jpg", "average": "4", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["The Learning Ladder"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3036797.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Educational", "Math", "Number"], "age": "3", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "A cute educational game in which players turn over a card with a simple maths problem and attempts to answer it correctly.

You'll sit down with some buddies during a session, in which one of your buddies runs the game as the Narrator (like a referee), and everyone else plays their pilot characters.<br/><br/>Your mecha and pilot characters each have a type (scavenger, converting fighter, striker), a few powerful weapons, and a set of traits (special abilities). Traits can be Skill-based (used as often as you'd like), or limited to once per Battle or once per Day, depending on the trait.<br/><br/>As your pilot character fights through the Separatists' War, he or she will attempt various things- sneaking into an enemy base, attacking a remote outpost, sabotaging a weapons lab, escorting an important scientist, etc.-and to do so, you'll perform rolls. To roll, you'll use the number of six-sided dice listed on the appropriate trait (such as Stealth), apply modifiers (such as -1 if it's dark), and roll that many 6-sided dice. This set of dice is called a dice pool.<br/><br/>If you're just trying to succeed at something- hack into a computer system, for example- then you succeed if any die rolls a 5 or 6. If you're attacking a mecha, the number of dice that roll 5 or 6 is subtracted from the enemy mecha's Armor. If attacking a person, if any die rolls a 5 or 6, the hit person is stunned, and drops unconscious if stunned enough times.<br/><br/>"}, "75072": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Gunwave"], "statistics": [], "name": "Gunwave Rule System", "rpgdesigner": ["Brent P.

It is the second video game in the Godfather series and based upon the 1972 film of the same name. Originally released in March 2006 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Microsoft Windows, The Godfather has since been released for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Wii. A smaller variant of the game has also been published for the PlayStation Portable.<br/><br/>The game is notable in that it features the return of several original actors from the original film to lend their voice. The participating actors are James Caan as Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, John Martino as Paulie Gatto, and Abe Vigoda as Salvatore Tessio, with the most notable absences being Marlon Brando (because of his ill health and his late death, the audio producers found that the quality of the recordings were not good enough and hired an imitator, although at one point in the game, players can hear the one piece of audio that Brando recorded), John Cazale (due to his death in 1978), Richard Castellano (due to his death in 1988) and Al Pacino (who is in fact absent in image as well as voice, choosing to lend his image exclusively to Scarface: The World Is Yours[clarification needed]). In addition, Mark Winegardner, author of the novel The Godfather Returns, provided story editing and insight into the fictional world of the Godfather.<br/><br/>Electronic Arts announced in 2005 that players would create mobsters of their own, customizing their character's physical features, build and clothing in a very in-depth program known as &quot;MobFace&quot;. Also, the game would not be the traditional mission-style type but a sandbox game, in a huge free-roam New York City of the 1940s and early 1950s, and have non-linear gameplay (similar to games in the Grand Theft Auto franchise). Electronic Arts has also created the &quot;Black Hand&quot; control system as a means of pressuring and extorting business owners. Using the analog sticks on the game controller, players have a wide range of available methods to achieve their goals. These methods include punching, kicking, headbutting, strangling, etc. EA has released a separate version for the Wii titled The Godfather: Blackhand Edition, which includes an enhanced &quot;Black Hand&quot; control system that makes use of the Wii's motion control capabilities. There is also a PlayStation 3 version (titled The Godfather: The Don's Edition) that includes the &quot;Corleone Expansion Pack&quot; (adding new gameplay and missions) and added Shipyard and Rail yard transportation hubs for the player to &quot;explore and exploit&quot;. The game engine used in The Godfather: The Game was later revamped and used in the science-fiction survival horror title Dead Space, which was released in 2008. The company released a sequel in 2009.<br/><br/>Plot and overview<br/>The game starts in 1936 with a cutscene that shows the death of Johnny Trapani, the father of the main character Aldo Trapani (The sequel confirmed that this is the canon name) and the blowing up of his bakery by the Barzini crime family, one of the Corleones' rivals in New York. In the aftermath, Don Vito Corleone comforts Aldo, telling him that when he is old enough and the time is right he will have his revenge. The story then fastforwards with the 1945 wedding scene in the opening of the film, wherein Aldo's mother asks Don Corleone to look after him, who has been hanging with the wrong crowd. Luca Brasi (Terry McGovern/Gary Chalk) is sent to recruit Aldo and teach him the ways of the Mafia. From this point forward, Aldo is taken under the Corleone Family's wing and works his way up in the organization.<br/><br/>Essentially, there are two stories in the game that intertwine, the first involving the major events of the film (with the character making central contributions) and a personal story arc. In the former, Aldo witnesses Luca Brasi's murder, plants the gun for Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) to kill Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey, helps Rocco Lampone put the horse head in Jack Woltz's bed, guards Don Vito Corleone at the hospital, witnesses the death of Sonny Corleone (James Caan), appears at the meeting of the five families and kills the Don's of the four other families during the baptism scene. In the latter storyline, Aldo befriends and later kills Corleone underman Marty &quot;Monk&quot; Malone, because he turns out to be a traitor, romances his sister Frances &quot;Frankie&quot; Malone and takes revenge for her death, and kills Don Emilio Barzini as revenge for killing his father, as well as assisting in the murder of the heads of the other rival families.<br/><br/>After the story missions have been completed, Aldo becomes an underboss. After he takes out the rival families' compounds he becomes the Don of the Corleone family's operations in New York. Alongside the story missions, Aldo continues to participate in the business of taking over control of New York from the rival families. This includes extorting businesses and buying out rackets, seizing control of warehouses, performing contract hits, and fighting mob wars when the vendetta level between the Corleones and a rival family gets high enough.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Gameplay consists of undertaking and completing eighteen story missions while in the meantime performing various tasks such as taking over rival family holdings and carrying out contract hits. The missions are linear and follow the storyline of the first film, starting out with the player's recruitment by Luca Brasi after Connie Corleone's wedding and ending with the baptism of Michael Corleone's godchild during which the player plays an instrumental role in carrying out the killings of the rival family members. Similarly, the player also must contend with attacks from rival family members that increase in aggressiveness with the player's vendetta level, which is raised as the player attacks rival gang members and their businesses.<br/><br/>Players can increase their character's experience points, represented in the game by a &quot;Respect&quot; level. This level is increased as the player finishes missions or side quests or after interacting with certain non-playable characters. Increasing respect levels allow the player to increase attributes such as health and speed, while skills include fighting, shooting and street smarts.<br/><br/>A central part of the game is gaining control of local businesses, illegal rackets, warehouses, compounds, and transportation hubs. Each family has a controlling interest in the game's locales of Little Italy, Brooklyn, Midtown Manhattan, Hell's Kitchen, and New Jersey. The player accomplishes this by threatening business/racket owners. Racket owners can also be bought out. Each business controlled generates income for the Corleone family and the player's character. Pay outs vary depending on the effectiveness of the player's tactics and is made easier with higher &quot;Street Smart&quot; levels. Later releases of the game allow players to take over businesses by doing favors for business owners.<br/><br/>The player's ultimate goal is making his way through the ranks and progressing up the ladder through various titles (Outsider, Enforcer, Associate, Soldier, Caporegime, UnderBoss, Don, and finally Don of New York City).<br/><br/>Families<br/>In the game there are five mafia families that have been adapted from the The Godfather. Each family is distinguished by its members wearing specific color coats as well as a shield bearing the family's first initial in its color with the exception of the Corleones, whose shield bears a rampant lion.<br/><br/>Other versions<br/>PSP<br/>A PlayStation Portable version was released, titled The Godfather: Mob Wars. Unlike the console versions, Mob Wars does not feature free-roaming environments. Instead, the game is restricted to a series of story missions involving Aldo Trapani. However, Mob Wars includes a new turn-based strategy mode with the aim of controlling all of New York City by neutralizing the rival families, completed by issuing orders and executing them as real-time missions. The portable version of the game also lacks the entire section of driving, even in the story missions, where the driving segments are replaced with cutscenes.<br/><br/>Wii<br/>The Wii version, entitled The Godfather: Blackhand Edition, is the highest rated version of The Godfather on Gamerankings and IGN,despite not faring as well with other publications. It features 20 normal missions, ten new hit missions, a new rival family seen only in the new hit missions, rooftop battles, new favors, and other methods such as blackmail and bribery. It was developed alongside the PS3 edition and released March 20, 2007. Improved upon the Xbox 360 edition, it includes brand new controls designed for the Wii Remote. Aiming is now handled by the pointer function of the Wii Remote, and allow more locational damages, though the lock-on option is still in the game. Melee combat is handled using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, such as swinging a baseball bat, or throwing a molotov cocktail. Once the player has taken hold of an NPC, the player may use a wide variety of hand to hand combat techniques. In total, there are 25 unique motion-based execution moves available in the game.<br/><br/>The Wii version also reworked the crew system; unlike the 360 edition, the crew will accompany the player even after loading a saved game where a crew had been hired previously. Furthermore, players also have the ability to call in a four-man hit squad to assist the player in missions; the gauge that is needed to be recharged can be automatically refilled if they did not sustain too much damage before the last save point, allowing player to instantly call upon them. This provides player with an ability to call upon a total of five crew members at any time.<br/><br/>The Blackhand Edition adds a second path that the player may take through the game, that of the operator. The main method of progression is by blackmailing police, the FBI or members of other families, and what the player does or says affects the outcome. While the enforcer's goal is to destroy the other families through brute force, the operator's is to blackmail the police chiefs of the five boroughs by finding enough &quot;dirt&quot; on them during missions. The player then blackmails the chiefs, enabling the bribe gauge to fill to the top for free every time the player talks to the chief, effectively allowing the player to take control of the police in that area. The police fight alongside the player's family members and can also arrest or kill rival family members. The path of the operator also grants the player additional tactical abilities that are not open to the enforcer, such as enhanced and regenerating health, the ability to call in the four-man hit squad twice as often, enhanced crew damages and health, ability to plant car bombs and make instant stealth kills, and reduced price on bribing on the police and FBI.<br/><br/>PS3<br/>The PlayStation 3 version, titled The Godfather: The Don's Edition, worked off the Wii's interactive controlling, and utilized the Sixaxis motion sensor controls. While the moves available are less than those available on Wii version, players can use Sixaxis to shove people around and perform special execution moves. However, unlike the Wii, these moves are generally finishing moves and thus not always available.<br/><br/>Additionally, the PS3 edition has two special locales, a freighter and a train yard, that serve as transportation hubs, providing a few special scenarios, as well as five new hit missions.<br/><br/>Mobile<br/>The Mobile version centers around a collection of mini games that guide the player through the storyline of the first movie. The mobile version was dubbed &quot;The Godfather Game&quot;.<br/><br/>"}, "75108": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic766056.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "videogamefranchise": ["The Legend of Zelda"], "videogameplatform": ["GameCube"], "poll": [], "videogamecompilation": ["The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past / Four Swords"], "statistics": [], "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["CDN Gamecube edition", "German GameCube edition", "JP GameCube edition", "UK GameCube edition", "US GameCube edition"], "videogamecharacter": ["Dark Link", "Ganondorf", "Kaepora Gaebora", "Link", "Vaati the Wind Mage"], "vgcharacterversion": ["Ganondorf", "Kaepora Gaebora", "Link", "Shadow Link", "Vaati the Wind Mage"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic766056_t.jpg", "videogame": ["The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past / Four Swords"], "description": "[From the back cover]:<br/><br/>One Destiny, Four Links!<br/><br/>For years, the might Four Sword sealed away an evil force...until one day, a dark shadow tricked young Link into drawing the sword from its resting place.

It was the last of the main titles to use the original Resident Evil game system prior to the change in system ushered in by the release of Resident Evil 4.<br/><br/>The game's storyline serves as a prequel to Resident Evil, covering Rebecca Chambers' ordeal a day prior. The game was released on November 10, 2002 in North America, November 21, 2002 in Japan, February 28, 2003 in Australia and March 7, 2003 in Europe.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>The main gameplay feature of Resident Evil Zero, dubbed the &quot;partner zapping&quot; system, is unique in the series in that instead of choosing a single character to play through the whole game, the player controls both the main characters, Rebecca Chambers, STARS Bravo team's medic, from Resident Evil and Billy Coen, an escaped ex-military convict, through the entire game. Both characters can travel together, with one character being controlled by the player and other by the computer, or split up and search separate areas each at the same time. This dual control is central to solving some of the puzzles in the game. The difference between the characters is that Rebecca can acquire chemicals with her mixing kit and can get into tight spaces, but has less health. In contrast, Billy can handle heavy objects, has a lighter and can sustain more damage than Rebecca, but cannot mix herbs.<br/><br/>The game also does away with the use of boxes placed in fixed locations for the player to store items in. Instead, the player can now drop items on the floor to make room for new ones, which they can later retrieve for future use. The locations of dropped items are displayed on the player's map.<br/><br/>Wii version<br/>A Wii version of Resident Evil Zero was released in Japan on July 10, 2008 as &quot;Resident Evil Archives: Resident Evil 0&quot;. The Wii version is a direct port of the original GameCube game with added support for the Wii Remote and Nunchuk (without pointer controls) and the Classic Controller in addition to the GameCube Controller. It was also released in North America on December 1, 2009.

Although the background does not scroll, the game was one of the first large platform games for a home video game console. Lost Caverns stays true to the gameplay of the original but greatly expands the scope of the environment, as Harry now descends deep into the catacombs. The game features vertical travel and scrolling; like the original, it does not scroll horizontally, but switches the screen when the player reaches the edge.<br/><br/>While faithful in many respects to its predecessor, Lost Caverns featured numerous changes to make it play differently from the original game. Pitfall Harry has unlimited time and lives, making it impossible to &quot;lose&quot; the game; when Harry touches a dangerous creature, he simply loses points as he floats back to the last continue point (marked with a red cross) he touched.<br/><br/>Unlike the original Pitfall!, which has a ground level and the underground, Pitfall II has 27 vertical levels, along with eight screens across. Quicksand and tar pits are replaced by rivers and chasms, neither of which is deadly to fall into (through dropping onto a hard surface will cause a loss of points). Balloons allow Harry to ascend to new areas. The game does not have the snakes or crocodiles of the original, but scorpions are still present. New animal hazards include bats, which fly across some screens from left to right; condors, which start by flying right to left, then reverse and fly left to right the remainder of the visit to that screen; Electric eels that swim in the rivers; and frogs that jump over some pits that have ladders, often above where a bat is present.<br/><br/>Two new unplayable characters debut in Lost Caverns: Quickclaw, Harry's cowardly pet mountain lion, and Rhonda, his adventure-seeking niece. Both of these characters also appear with Harry in the Saturday Supercade children's cartoon based on the Pitfall games (in fact, Rhonda and Quickclaw were created for Saturday Supercade a full year before this game was released). Collecting Rhonda, Quickclaw, and a diamond ring is necessary to win the game. In versions without a second cave, upon collection of all three, the game ends on the spot. The maximum possible score is 199,000 (which differs in the Atari 8-bit and 5200 versions, see Adventurer's Edition below).<br/><br/>While Quickclaw is visible on the platform below the starting point of the game, he is inaccessible from this point, and Harry must traverse nearly the entire cave in order to reach him. On the screen to the right is a creature called the &quot;cave rat&quot;. Harry can drop into the first river through a hole in the third screen. From there, moving one screen to the left brings him to the location of the cave rat. However, the cave rat at this point cannot be passed, and will push Harry back into the water, thereby blocking access to Quickclaw and its own collection. The cave rat can be accessed after reaching Quickclaw by approaching it from behind (on the left side). When it reaches the right side of the screen, it'll stop, and its collection will result in 15,000 being added to the score.<br/><br/>Another enhancement over the previous game is the addition of a soundtrack. The musical cues act as subtle rewards and punishments for performance. The main &quot;heroic&quot; theme plays for a short while before reaching a loop of atmospheric music. When Harry collects a treasure, the main theme begins again. If Harry dies, a downbeat version of the theme plays, continuing until Harry succeeds at finding more treasure. Finally, if Harry ascends using the Balloon, Sobre las Olas (&quot;Over the Waves&quot;) is played.<br/><br/>Pitfall II: Lost Caverns was one of the largest games ever created for the Atari 2600 and featured elements previously considered impossible on hardware that was already over 6 years old at the time. Smooth scrolling, detailed animation, and a musical score that includes multiple channels were all made possible by custom hardware built inside the game cartridge. Crane designed and patented a component he called the Display Processor Chip (DPC), which could greatly enhance the 2600's graphics capabilities and could process music in 3 channels plus drums. Crane hoped that the DPC would be used by other game designers to further extend the life of the aging console, but the video game crash of 1983 made this impossible.<br/><br/>"}, "75152": {"poll": [], "name": "Solium Infernum", "videogamemode": ["Asynchronous Multiplayer", "Hotseat", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic867476.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Mythology"], "usersrated": "10", "videogamedeveloper": ["Cryptic Comet"], "videogamegenre": ["4x Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "7.7", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Cryptic Comet"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic867476_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Site<br/><br/>The Prince of Darkness has vanished and the Infernal Throne sits empty.

Even such a war is only allocated a limited number of turns and a specific goal, and the aggressor must wager Prestige on their victory.<br/><br/>Each player may create their own demon with several statistics which influence their ability to lead armies, to gather resources (and steal them from other players), and which may raise the cost or risk of political actions against them.

The players will gain VP from reading manuscripts, looking for important documents like the Canticle of the Sun or &quot;The Riddle from Verona&quot;. Players can also gain VP by improving their social status, for example, if the merchant becomes a banker or the Friar becomes a Benedictine Monk or the Cardinal becomes Camerlengo or Pope.

The game was developed by Zipper Interactive in collaboration with the Naval Special Warfare Command and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. SOCOM II was released on November 4, 2003.<br/><br/>SOCOM II shows how graphics evolved from their ancestors of SOCOM I. SOCOM II is a third-person tactical shooter for the PlayStation 2 that combines the elements of strategy, health, reflex and hand-eye coordination. There are 12 different single-player missions: split equally between Albania, Algeria, Brazil  and Russia. There are 5 different ranks that can be played in the game: Ensign, Lieutenant, Commander, Captain and Admiral. The player starts with the first three ranks unlocked, but must finish the entire single player game on Commander to unlock Captain and on Captain to unlock Admiral. Players can unlock new models for multiplayer, as well as movies, music, concept art, and credits by completing certain objectives. For example, beating the Albania missions on Commander unlocks Pius skin for multiplayer. Each mission has Primary Objectives, Secondary Objectives, and Hidden Bonus Objectives. Players have to complete all the Primary Objectives to win the mission, and Secondary Objectives are optional, but add to the overall score for the mission. The Hidden Bonus Objectives usually help make other missions easier. For example, finding a map in one mission means the player will not have to work to find that place in the next mission. A letter grade is received at the end of each mission based on 4 categories of score: Stealth, Accuracy, Teamwork, and Objective Completion.<br/><br/>In single player, commands can be administered to the rest of the team. This can be done using either the command menu or a USB headset. The menu features new command options, enabling the player to order their teammates to drop to the ground and hold position when outdoors. The artificial intelligence for both sides has generally improved during single player play. Terrorists, for example, will now side-strafe and lie prone in foliage. Zipper stated that they integrated some tactics from the online portion into the new AI, while squadmates who are in the &quot;Fire at Will&quot; state will take down the opposing force in an efficient manner. There are a few problems such as when teammates run into walls because the player has gotten too far ahead.<br/><br/>"}, "75178": {"rpgdesigner": ["P. H.

With Total Punch Control, movement and most maneuvers, including punching, leaning and blocking, are performed with the left or right analog sticks, modified by the left or right triggers. For example, with the default controller configuration, moving the right thumbstick up and to the left will cause the fighter to throw a straight punch with his left hand, while holding down the right trigger while performing the same movement and then holding will cause the fighter to raise his guard to the left side of his head, ready to attempt a parry.<br/><br/>Fight Night Round 2 expands upon the Total Punch Control scheme with the addition of another feature, the EA SPORTS Haymaker. An EA SPORTS Haymaker is a more powerful version of one of the basic power punches (hooks and uppercuts) and is performed by pulling the analog stick back before performing the movements for a regular punch. If it connects, a Haymaker causes quite a bit of damage, can stagger the victim and may cause an instant knockdown, regardless of the victim's health or stamina status.

Fight Night Round 3 was released on February 22, 2006 for the Xbox, Xbox 360, PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 2. The PlayStation 3 version of the game was released on December 6, 2006.<br/><br/>Overview<br/>Fight Night Round 3 is the third boxing title from EA Sports, upon succeeding from the Knockout Kings games on the PlayStation. It features the usual improvements such as better graphics and gameplay. &quot;Impact Punches&quot; are one of the most drastic changes, along with ESPN Classic fights and a new career mode, in which the player fights to gain popularity in order to reach sponsored fights, or to be featured on ESPN. Unlike in older versions, Round 3 defaults without a heads-up display (HUD), allowing a player to judge the status of their stamina and energy based on their stance, movements, and facial features, instead of the usual stamina meter.<br/><br/>Versions<br/>The game has been released for several video game consoles and some differences exist between the versions. The cover art features the late Arturo Gatti and Micky Ward on the PS2 and Xbox versions. The PS3, Xbox 360, and the PSP versions have Oscar De La Hoya on the cover.

In contrast to Assault of the Dead: Tactics has a character building system (that includes Perks, Weapons, and Survival kits) as well as support for solo play.<br/><br/>Assault of the Dead: Tactics is set in a fictional zombie-infested city called Cloverdale. The game's story follows through scenarios, unfolding part of the city map allowing the players to explore new and dangerous areas. As the story progresses, you and your allies discover a sinister effect behind the zombie outbreak.<br/><br/>The game-play of Assault of the Dead: Tactics differs in several key areas;  Characters move on a battlefield composed of circular tiles; movement and actions are determined by the character's Perks, Weapons, and Survival Kits he carries. Battles are low luck; a character can use any number of actions to attack, with attacks always hitting. During battle, whenever an attack is made, dice rolls determine the number of damage points the character can 'spend' on hits and weapon crits. Deal enough hits, and the Zombie is defeated leaving behind a Survival token -- used to buy actions or resupply your character.<br/><br/>Like the original Assault of the Dead: Tactics adjusts the level of reaction from the Zombie side based on how well the characters are doing.

Additionally, some of the weapons operations are substantially different from previous Worms titles.<br/><br/>Modes like Campaign and Quick Match return from previous versions. The game also features a multiplayer feature, as well as the ability to edit and create teams. The objective of most of the matches is to eliminate the opposing forces' worms, whereas the Campaign mode gives the player sets of specific goals which he needs to complete. The gameplay itself hasn't changed much from its predecessors, with the exception of the three-dimensional view, which allows the player more freedom, and more possibilities, to complete the task at hand.<br/><br/>The campaign consists of 35 small missions in which the player has to utilise their worms to complete a certain task, like destroy enemy worms, collect a certain crate, or even unique missions, like having to detonate 16 hidden landmines in a certain time. All of the missions give awards depending on how well you do. Gold medals usually unlock maps, wormapedia entries or even sometimes easter eggs (usually wormapedia entries, voice banks or secret landscapes). Sometimes, completing missions will give you a challenge mission in which you have to use a weapon/utility to collect targets and to try and go for as long as possible (as collecting targets adds time to your timer). Getting a gold time can unlock maps or locked weapons.<br/><br/>The Game also has various tools that can be used at the players disposal to complete the mission or destroy the enemy. Some of these items consist of: the Jet Pack that has a certain amount of fuel, and can be earned by finding and unlocking it. There is a whole armory of weapons from bazooka launchers to sticky bombs that are well constructed. Other items like the Parachute, can be very useful to get from one place to another.<br/><br/>Yet another aspect of the Gameplay is the environment itself. The landscape on many of the maps can be destroyed by the player to create a game field that best suits the player.

The deluxe version, as its name implies, is an expanded and improved version of the original game. (A &quot;World Editor&quot; expansion pack was also released for the original Transport Tycoon, but was overshadowed by the Deluxe version released shortly afterward; interestingly, it featured an alternate, Martian set of graphics, which did not appear in TTD).<br/><br/>The primary difference between the games is how signals operate. The original Transport Tycoon allows only bi-directional signals, which allow trains to pass in either direction. The deluxe version introduced uni-directional signals, that only allow a train to pass in a single direction.<br/><br/>The change in gameplay from this relatively minor alteration to signals is significant, as the old bi-directional signals would allow a train to travel in both directions. This is similar in concept to having a single lane street that would allow traffic from either end. Unsurprisingly, it was possible for two trains to try to travel in opposing directions towards each other on the same run of track. While this would not result in crashes on a properly signaled route, it required either the building of extra track to allow the trains to pass each other, or the building of a great many tracks in parallel to avoid the problem in the first place.<br/><br/>The new uni-directional signals allowed one-way tracks to be built, which gives the player much greater control over how the railway network could be run. This allowed for efficient routes to be built, and prevented trains from trying to travel the &quot;wrong way&quot; down a section of track. By incorporating both uni-directional and bi-directional signals, effective switching yards, junctions, and other useful designs could be built. It also unlocked the ability to build continental-length railroad systems by incorporating one-way rails in both directions and the ability to merge other rails with the main one. This is a highly used strategy because it allows for intercontinental transport of goods which results in high return rates for the user.<br/><br/>The deluxe version also expanded the game to provide tropical, Arctic, and toy-town environments, as well as the classic temperate environment. The new environments came with different industries and challenges. For example, towns in the Arctic environment would not grow without regular deliveries of food, and those in the tropical environment also need access to fresh water.<br/><br/>Due to copyright issues with using names of real vehicles in the original Transport Tycoon, the default names were replaced with fictional ones in Transport Tycoon Deluxe. Players however are allowed to rename their vehicles and stations as they please, which can be useful for identifying individual services in a network. Players are also able to rename towns, which provides for a more personalized game play.<br/><br/>"}, "75233": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Le 55", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!"], "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic763801_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Hydrass"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic763801.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Each player start the game with 4 cards.

Each version had its own developers and publishers - this VGG entry concerns the SNES/GBA version that was developed and published by Capcom. Interestingly, Capcom waited a full decade before developing and publishing this game on the Game Boy Advance.<br/><br/>Unlike the Sega Mega Drive version of the game, the player does not equip a scimitar. Instead, the gameplay revolves around jumping on enemies, as well as vaulting off stumps to reach otherwise inaccessible areas, though like the Genesis version, the player can also throw apples to stun opponents. The storyline more or less closely follows the plot of its namesake, the Disney full-length animated motion picture, with Aladdin going from a street rat to a prince, who first woos, and then has to rescue, the Princess Jasmine. Most levels and stages of the game will be readily recognized by people who have seen the motion picture, but there are a few levels that have nothing to do with the movie including an Egyptian pyramid and a surreal world where Genie dressed in a tuxedo serves as Aladdin's guide (this level represents Genie's song sequence You Ain't Never Had A Friend Like Me, and has an instrumental version of that song playing in the background). The game features renditions of the soundtrack from the Disney motion picture, as well as several mini-games dependent on the player catching a golden scarab or collecting all diamonds within a stage. An extra challenge involved finding 70 red diamonds throughout the game. While they weren't necessary for ending the game, the credits screen changes slightly according to how many diamonds were collected. That version sold over 1.75 million units worldwide.<br/><br/>The reason that the Super Nintendo version of developed by Capcom and not Virgin Interactive was that the film came out at a time when Capcom held the licensing rights to games on Nintendo consoles based on Disney intellectual property. This deal resulted in some classic titles as Ducktales, Darkwing Duck, Who Framed Roger Rabbit? (Game Boy version), and Goof Troop. The license expired some time between the cinematic releases of Aladdin and The Lion King, as the videogame adaptation of The Lion King was developed by Virgin Interactive on all platforms including the Super Nintendo, and the Mega Drive version of Aladdin was ported to the NES for a European release on New Year's Eve 1994. The Capcom version was also ported unofficially to the NES by an unknown company in 1995. It was also ported unofficially to the Mega Drive/Genesis<br/><br/>A version of the game would also later receive a port for the Game Boy Advance with an extra stage, though all the songs based directly on the original movie were replaced with new music.<br/><br/>"}, "75271": {"poll": [], "name": "Fighting Vipers", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Arcade Version", "EU PS3 PSN Version", "EU Xbox 360 XBLA Version", "European Saturn edition", "Japanese PS3 PSN Version", "Japanese Saturn edition", "Japanese Xbox 360 XBLA Version", "US Saturn edition", "US Xbox 360 XBLA Version"], "average": "7.45", "videogameseries": ["Fighting Vipers"], "videogametheme": ["Martial Arts"], "usersrated": "6", "videogamedeveloper": ["SEGA-AM2 Co.

Each version had its own developers and publishers - this VGG entry concerns the one that was published on the most platforms: Amiga, DOS, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Genesis and NES. All of these version were developed by Virgin, although publishers naturally vary by platform and region.<br/><br/>Mega Drive/Genesis version<br/>The game from Virgin based on the 1992 animated Disney film, released initially on the Sega Genesis console, is a side-scrolling platformer.<br/><br/>The Genesis version was released in 1993 jointly by Virgin Interactive and Sega. The game, which was notable for its use of cel animation for in-game graphic elements, was produced by a team at Virgin Interactive which consisted of many members who would later form Shiny Entertainment and work on Earthworm Jim, including Mike Dietz and David Perry himself (who supposedly coded the game in 3 months). Also involved were veteran game designer David Bishop and animators Andy Luckey and Ian Freedman. Five original compositions and five arrangements from the movie were composed by Donald S. Griffin at the request of Virgin's audio director, Tommy Tallarico, who did the Genesis instruments and incidental transition music.<br/><br/>The Genesis version was worked on by Disney animators under the supervision of Virgin's Animation Producer Andy Luckey and Virgin animators Mike Dietz and Ian Freedman. This was achieved by use of the &quot;Digicel&quot; process -- developed at Virgin Interactive by David Perry, Andy Astor, Andy Luckey and Dr. Stephen Clarke-Willson. The process compressed the data from the animator's drawings into the limited processing capacity of the Sega Genesis cartridge and/or Mega Drive<br/><br/>Game design<br/>The game involves killing enemies with basic swordplay and jumping across ledges. There are several levels, including one level where Aladdin must escape from the Cave of Wonders on Carpet and another where he must jump across the Agrabah's rooftops.<br/><br/>The player controls Aladdin, who must make his way through several levels based on locations from the movie: from the streets and rooftops of Agrabah, the Cave of Wonders and the Sultan's dungeon to the final confrontation in Grand Vizier Jafar's palace. The Sultan's guards and also animals of the desert want to hinder Aladdin in his way. He can defend himself with his sword or by throwing apples. Next to apples, Aladdin can also collect gems which can be traded for lives and continues with a traveling trader. Finding Genie or Abu icons enables bonus rounds. The Genie bonus round is a game of luck played for apples, gems or extra lives, and continues until the player runs out of Genie tokens or lands on Jafar. In Abu's bonus round, the player controls the little monkey who has to catch bonus items that fall from the sky, but without touching any of the unwanted objects like rocks and pots.<br/><br/>Ports to NES and Game Boy<br/>A NES game was released in Europe based on this version. It was also ported, unofficially, twice more to the NES under the names Super Aladdin and Aladdin 2; Super Aladdin is generally considered superior to the official port.

It was first released in North America, and was later released in Europe. The game is set immediately after the events of the DreamWorks movie Over the Hedge, unlike the console versions which follow the events of the film. Vicarious Visions is responsible for many handheld versions of licensed video games. Publisher Activision has a longstanding business relationship with animation studio DreamWorks and has exclusive global rights to publish games based on DreamWorks animated films.<br/><br/>Gameplay involves guiding three playable woodland creatures through suburban houses to collect items and return them to their forest. House inhabitants and traps must be avoided or neutralized to succeed. The game's plot concerns Gladys Sharp's attempt to turn what's left of the animals' forest into a swimming pool; the animals try to prevent this by luring endangered species to the forest, making the forest a protected habitat. Over the Hedge received positive and average reviews from the gaming press, as well as gaming website IGN's 'Best Game No One Played' award for 2006. The game was praised for the technical achievement of displaying full 3D on both of the Nintendo DS' screens, but some reviewers found the gameplay repetitive.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Verne encounters one of the inhabitants whilst exploring a house. The red cone on the lower screen shows the man's sight range.The game has been likened to both Tomb Raider and Metal Gear Solid due to the 3D platforming and stealth gameplay respectively. Players guide the forest inhabitants through 20 levels, during which they must infiltrate a series of suburban homes in order to steal a variety of items and destroy construction materials.[1] The items needed to lure endangered animals to the forest must be collected from houses and carried back to the forest one at a time. Each level requires several trips to be completed. Security systems must be avoided or deactivated in order to progress through each level. Household members and their pets must also be avoided, distracted or stunned by a thrown object. For example, a phone card can be used to make a prank call to lure a householder away, catnip can be used to distract cats.<br/><br/>Each character has their own unique abilities. Verne has the strength to push and carry large items and can retract into his shell in order to avoid detection, but cannot jump as high or run as swift as the other characters. RJ has average strength and agility. He can climb, lift items and also throw Verne. Hammy is the most agile of the three, running swifter and jumping higher. This enables him to circumvent security more easily.<br/><br/>Over the Hedge is presented in full 3D on both of the Nintendo DS' screens, which is not often seen in a Nintendo DS game.  The upper screen displays the game in an over-the-shoulder third person perspective, whereas the touch screen shows an overhead perspective. The lower screen indicates the sight range of enemies and can be used as a touch screen to target enemies to attack.[10] The console's microphone is used to attract the attention of dogs or to rouse the woodland creatures should they be knocked unconscious.<br/><br/>Multiplayer<br/>A multiplayer mini-game is included and allows two players to compete via the DS' wireless connection, only one player needs an Over the Hedge game cartridge for two separate DS consoles to play. Stella the skunk is available in this game mode, alongside the three playable characters from the main game. Players navigate a maze to collect food before the timer runs out. The player with the most food wins the game. A most of five pieces of food can be carried at once, these must be carried to a collection area before more food can be picked up.<br/><br/>"}, "75306": {"rpgdesigner": ["Fl\u00e1vio Andrade", "Carlos K.

It features the characters Terry and Milayou from Dragon Quest VI when they were children, before the events in Dragon Quest VI. Dragon Warrior Monsters is often compared to the Pok&eacute;mon series due to their similar gameplay. Critics set the games apart by noting the in-depth breeding system seen in this game.<br/><br/>The game follows Terry as he attempts to save his sister. Instead of fighting in battle, Terry is able to recruit monsters into his party. When fighting random battles, Terry can set out meat, which may coax the monster into joining the party at the end of the battle. Terry can also breed two monsters, combining them into a new, stronger monster. Excess monsters can be placed on the Farm, a storage place for monsters. They can be picked up or dropped off and there is an option to put monsters at the farm to sleep, which allows them to maintain their wilderness level, but not grow in level. There can be 19 awake and 19 asleep monsters at any one time. A monster's wilderness level lowers as Terry trains them, which makes them more likely to participate in battle. By leaving monsters at the farm awake, they become more wild.<br/><br/>"}, "75310": {"rpgdesigner": ["William C.

Also added is the ability to cancel a throw and hold the ball, or pump fake during a rundown. A player can also attempt a &quot;Quick Throw&quot; which gets the ball to a base faster but also increases the chance of an error. Baserunning control has been simplified; a player only needs to hold down the trigger until it vibrates, for instance, then release it when ready to attempt a steal.

The game is officially licensed from the National Hockey League and NHL Players Association. Being the third game in the NHL Hockey series franchise, it was released on March 15, 1993. NHL '94 is included as #47 on IGN's Top 100 Games of All-Time and is named All-Time Greatest Sports Video Game by Boston.com and various gaming forums.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>NHL Hockey has NHL and NHLPA licences, so player names and team logos are in use. (Photo: DOS version)Just like its predecessors -- NHL Hockey and NHLPA Hockey '93 -- NHL '94 was designed to give gamers the most realistic hockey experience possible. The game maintained the series' signature vertical camera angle, which offered the player distinct gameplay and strategic advantages over contemporary side-view hockey games, and kept the 2D sprite character models of NHLPA '93 (albeit with some new animations). While today such a lack of graphical change from year to year would be criticized by players, the NHLPA '93 framework was regarded as the most groundbreaking hockey engine ever made meaning that NHL '94 had the luxury of simply tweaking the basic aspects of the game. The result was one of the most widely-acclaimed sports games ever made, and a game that still has an extensive cult following to this day, such as NHL94.com<br/><br/>That's not to say no improvements were made to the engine by EA between 1992 and 1993. Notably, NHL '94 introduced the &quot;one timer&quot;, an authentic hockey move where a player shoots the puck directly off of a pass; NHL '94 's one-timer was in fact so devastating that it would become the scoring method of choice for most players. However, other techniques such as &quot;the duper&quot; and &quot;the move&quot; remain quite popular and effective scoring tactics. Because of NHL 94 's (mostly) realistic and action-packed gameplay, the game is almost universally considered the best hockey game of its generation, and is frequently mentioned in &quot;all-time top sports game&quot; lists.<br/><br/>New features<br/>Key features in this game are the ability to shoot a one timer, better all-around control of players, breaking the glass, a kid sitting in the stands who gets up and bangs on the glass behind the net, being able to save your records[4], as well as the four modes - Regular Season, Playoffs, Best of Seven Playoffs, and Shootout. There are no international teams, but both all-star teams are present. Also introduced were team-specific organ songs played at the start of periods and after goals examples included the Hartford Whalers' trademark &quot;Brass Bonanza&quot;, &quot;When the Saints Go Marching In&quot; for the St. Louis Blues, and the Chicago Blackhawks theme song &quot;Here Come the Hawks&quot;.<br/><br/>Game Modes<br/><br/>     Exhibition Game <br/>     Stanley Cup Playoffs: Single Game Series <br/>     Stanley Cup Playoffs: Best of Seven Series <br/>     Shootout Mini-Game <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Removed features<br/>Fighting was removed from the game.<br/><br/>Other versions<br/>The game was included in the PlayStation 2 version of NHL '06. The port included was based on the Sega Genesis version, but lacked the official NHL rosters from the original title.<br/><br/>A version titled NHL Pro Hockey '94 was released in Japan for the Super Famicom which has all the important text in Japanese including the main menu, the actual hockey players, the secondary (end of period and post-game) menus, and the crowd meter.

As the game opens, however, he is awakened by severe error messages; something is going catastrophically wrong.

It is a spinoff of the PC game Interstate '76, and features several concepts (auto-vigilantes, the 1970s time frame, and specific fictional vehicle companies) carried over from that title. Vigilante 8 was developed with a team of only five people (Peter Morawiec, Adrian Stephens, David Goodrich, Jeremy Engleman, and Edward Toth), a seemingly impossibly small team size for developing a PlayStation game, when most development teams for such a console ranged around 20-30 people in the 1990s.<br/><br/>The developer of the two Vigilante 8 games, Luxoflux, produced a game very similar to Vigilante 8 using the Star Wars licence (and the Vigilante 8 game engine), titled Star Wars: Demolition, and has since produced the Grand Theft Auto-inspired True Crime: Streets of LA.<br/><br/>Vigilante 8 is also very similar to the Twisted Metal series, but with improved graphics and more realistic physics. Vigilante 8 and Vigilante 8: Second Offense were innovative in the degree of level interaction, weapon design and combo systems.[citation needed] It should also be noted that, in the PlayStation version of the game, you may switch the Vigilante 8 disc with any audio CD to replace the game's soundtrack; the game will continue to play without the game disc.<br/><br/>Unlike other game titles where numbers denote sequels, Vigilante 8 was rather a pun on V8.<br/><br/>&quot;&quot;Synopsis&quot;&quot;<br/> This video game-related article describes an aspect of the game in a primarily in-universe style. Please help rewrite it to explain the fiction more clearly and provide non-fictional perspective. (May 2007)<br/><br/>The game's storyline is built around an alternate history, in which there was a worldwide oil crisis in the 1970s and the U.S. was on the verge of an economic breakdown. Strikes, riots and crime were rampant, and all available law enforcement were brought to the cities leaving the outlands vulnerable.<br/><br/>A foreign multinational oil consortium, Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime (OMAR), was determined to monopolize the world oil trade. The U.S. was the last country that stood in their way and they were prepared to go to any length to bring the U.S. to its knees.<br/><br/>OMAR hired Sid Burn, a professional terrorist, to push the U.S. economy over the edge. Sid began to organize his troops in the remote areas of the southwest. Calling themselves the &quot;Coyotes,&quot; they began to target oil refineries, commercial installations and other vital industry throughout the region.<br/><br/>With the law enforcement in the cities, some desperate civilians began to take the law into their own hands. Led by a trucker named Convoy and referred to simply as the &quot;Vigilantes,&quot; this oddball group soon became a major hindrance to Sid.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the U.S. government, feeling more vulnerable than ever, was intensifying its research and development of a new military arsenal. The most advanced weaponry, rumored to be based on UFO technology, was located at Site-4, a secret facility at Papoose Lake. This information was not lost on Sid, and the Coyotes ambushed the facility. However the Vigilantes unexpectedly appeared to stop them and as a result, both parties found themselves in possession of the world's most advanced weaponry.<br/><br/>What followed were no ordinary skirmishes. Auto clashes ensued all over the land, from Colorado's Rockies to California's farmlands, only to culminate in a battle like no other. To this day the events which took place are only a matter of speculation.<br/><br/>&quot;&quot;Weapons&quot;&quot;<br/>The game includes a variety of weapons, most of which are picked up during gameplay. Every vehicle is equipped with the Mosquito Machine Gun by default (which is relatively weak on its own, but has infinite ammunition).<br/><br/>&quot;&quot;Xbox Live Arcade&quot;&quot;<br/>Main article: Vigilante 8 Arcade<br/>A remake for the Xbox 360, titled Vigilante 8 Arcade, was created by Isopod Labs, an independent company formed by the founders of Luxoflux.

To control the tank and play the game requires the use of a large controller  made specially for Steel Battalion.<br/><br/>The controller has two control sticks and around 40 buttons. The game, bundled with the controller included, launched at a retail price of around &yen;19,800, &pound;130, or $200. Only limited quantities were made available. These quickly sold out, making the game a collector's piece. It has since been re-released in limited quantities worldwide, with blue controller buttons distinguishing it from the first edition with green buttons.<br/><br/>A sequel called Steel Battalion: Line of Contact was released in 2004, and also used the game's unique controller.<br/><br/>At the beginning of every mission, the player must 'start up' the machine and operating system; this is handled through a series of switches and buttons dedicated to this purpose. If the player does not eject when prompted, the player's in game character will die, and all saved data will be lost, causing the player to start over. If a corner is turned too fast, the machine will tumble over. If the player's machine overheats, its operating system must be reset. The game even simulates window wipers in case of mud hitting the monitor.<br/><br/>A reviewer on IGN joked, &quot;where MechAssault and Robotech wouldn't let us into the cockpit, Steel Battalion won't let us out&quot;. [5]<br/>[edit] Vertical Tanks<br/><br/>Vertical tanks (VTs) are the primary vehicles piloted in the Capcom video games Steel Battalion and Steel Battalion: Line of Contact. Essentially bipedal walking weapons platforms, VTs are classed by their developmental generation and sub-categorised by their combat role. Primary combat roles are standard combat, assault, support, scout, and fast attack. VTs are categorized by type based on their weight. There are light, middle, and heavy types.<br/><br/>* The Light VT's main focus is on mobility. It has been developed for use in situations where you are chasing after an enemy that is running away or for attacking enemy bases after their main firepower has been destroyed. Light VTs are capable of being transported by air and are designed to be dropped into key drop spots. Their use can be pivotal for air assaults on bases.<br/>    * The Middle VT is used as the main offensive force. One of their notable characteristics is that, while they maintain a balance of firepower and strong armor, they are agile and can move quickly. Of the three types of VTs, this one is the most numerous. This VT has the most possible variations through add-on armor and weapons.<br/>    * Heavy VTs employ heavy armor and great firepower, but due to this they have decreased mobility compared to other VTs. With their heavy firepower and armor, these VTs are mainly used to protect key locations and bases.<br/><br/>As the player progresses, new generations of VT will become available  each sporting a newer, more advanced operating system, startup sequence, and combat functions, as well as a wider cockpit view and layout. New generation VTs also handle better and can support better firepower than previous generations.<br/><br/>"}, "75365": {"rpgdesigner": ["Robert Hemminger"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "statistics": [], "name": "Arcana Core Book", "rpgartist": ["Robert Hemminger"], "rpgproducer": ["Robert Hemminger"], "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "rpgsetting": ["Arcana"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Avalon Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)"], "poll": [], "description": "Publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The world is about to fall into turmoil, the likes of which it has never faced before.

The Northlands is composed of cold, wind swept plains and hard grass and brush and the deep, wide expanse of the great Northern woods, which covers the whole top of the area, from the sea to the Bay of the Lion&rsquo;s Maul.<br/><br/>Here men, dwarfs and hidden conclaves of elves struggle to survive not only the hard lands they call home, but also the constant threat of goblin war and monstrous beasts.  Life is hard and cold in the north, but this has only made the folk of the land more determined and ready to face what life throws at them.<br/><br/>A complete guide to the Northlands, with information on its history, people, places and culture.  Also comes with several new full color maps and lots of information you wont get anywhere else.<br/><br/>If you love Arcana, then this is a must have addition to you collection.<br/><br/>"}, "75367": {"rpgdesigner": ["Robert Hemminger"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "poll": [], "name": "Shorenborg", "rpgartist": ["Robert Hemminger"], "rpgproducer": ["Robert Hemminger"], "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "rpgsetting": ["Arcana"], "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Avalon Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)"], "rpgseries": ["Arcana Realms"], "description": "Publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The realm of Shorenborg is small and respectively new to the world.

The last of the Han dynasty family, Liu Bei, begins a rebellion against the kingdom of Wei led by Cao Cao, with much of the game's events being based on the novel with alterations due to the different story lines.

In battle, these characters are able to cause earthquakes, summon lightning storms and hurl fireballs.<br/><br/>The gameplay involves playing out major battles as the storyline progresses, with cutscenes between each battle for the development of the events and major characters.

Contrary to many stories and portrayals that depict him as a villain or demon, Nobunaga is depicted in a more virtuous and ultimately tragic light, making Kessen III rather unusual in relation to other video games based in the same era. It is a heavily fantasized and romanticized depiction of his life, although unlike games such as the Samurai Warriors series it goes into more specific historical details. For example, the existence of the Ashikaga shogunate and Nobunaga's relationship is covered herein but completely omitted from the Samurai Warriors games.<br/><br/>The game paints a positive picture of Nobunaga's life, and then enters a &quot;What If&quot; scenario showing what might have happened if he had survived the betrayal by Akechi Mitsuhide. It describes Nobunaga regaining his power base, and then defeating Shogunate forces led by the Akechi clan and other clans of Western Japan on the shores of Ky\u016bsh\u016b, with Nobunaga presumably becoming the new leader.<br/><br/>Tokugawa Ieyasu is in this game, presented as Nobunaga's mild mannered and dedicated ally, but is shown flying into a rage when he learns that Nobunaga survives his betrayal, believing that he was going to carry out Nobunaga's destiny. Toyotomi Hideyoshi is also shown, under the name of Hideyoshi Hashiba.

A set of wargame rules using military miniatures, that allows players to recreate the small engagements and portions of larger battles of the American Civil War, 1861-1864.<br/><br/>Scale. Tactical. 10-15 minutes per turn. 1&quot; = 25 yards. Units are regiments of infantry or cavalry and gun sections grouped into batteries for artillery. Intended for 15mm figures, other scale figures can be used by increasing or decreasing the basing and ground scales as described in the rules.<br/><br/>Basing. Each 1&quot; x 3/4&quot; stand with 3 infantry figures, and 1&quot; x 1&quot; with 2 cavalry figures, represents 40 men. Each 1&quot; x 1-1/2&quot; stand with a gun model and 2 or 3 figure crew represents a 2-gun section. Unit size can range from 3 to 20 troop stands per regiment, with the average of 8-12 stands per unit. Batteries are represented by 2 to 3 gun stands.<br/><br/>Game Turn Sequence. A game turn is divided into an alternating Union player turn and Confederate player turn. Players must follow the Player Turn Sequence. Each player turn consists of three phases. One phase must be completed before moving to the next. Some activities in a phase are performed by the opposing player or jointly by both players.<br/><br/>Maneuver Phase - In the first phase of a player turn the player must resolve a maneuver check for each unit which he controls on the game table. A maneuver check involves either one or more units under the command of a single leader, or a single unit that is out of command. The maneuver check combines the elements in warfare of morale, command and control into a single die roll procedure using the Maneuver Table. The effects from the table describe the movement and other maneuvers that each unit is allowed or required to perform in this phase.<br/><br/>Musketry and Cannonade Phase - There are two kinds of combat in the game: fire combat and charge combat. All fire combat is resolved in the second phase of the player turn. Both Union and Confederate units may fire during this phase. The phase consists of two rounds of fire combat. It begins with a round of defensive fire followed by a round of offensive fire. In the Confederate player turn only Union units may defensive fire, and only Confederate units may offensive fire. During the Union player turn the order is reversed with Confederate defensive fire followed by Union offensive fire. All fire combat is resolved using the Musketry &amp; Cannonade Table to determine casualties and other combat effects.<br/><br/>Charge Phase - In the third and final phase of a player turn a charge combat must be resolved wherever a charging unit made contact with the enemy. The relative position between attacking and defending units will determine which combats need to be divided into less complex combat situations. Both sides then follow a joint die roll procedure to resolve a round of charge combat. The Charge Table is used to determine casualties and other combat effects. Depending on the results of the first round of combat, a second round of breakthrough charge combat may follow after all first round charge combats are resolved. After all charge combat is resolved, the current player turn ends and the next player turn begins.<br/><br/>Battle Scenarios.

It was released for the PC on March 15, 2005. Like Silent Hunter II, it places the player in command of a German U-Boat during World War II and the Second Battle of the Atlantic. It sought to address many of the complaints leveled against its predecessor, specifically the lack of a dynamic campaign.<br/><br/>Silent Hunter III features a fully dynamic campaign. Instead of giving the player a specific set of objectives for each mission, Silent Hunter III simply assigns the player a certain patrol grid, and appropriate naval traffic, such as convoys, destroyer escorts, and task forces are automatically generated by the simulation engine. How the mission proceeds and what targets are attacked is left totally up to the player. In addition to being a more accurate representation of WWII U-Boat warfare, the dynamic campaign significantly improves the game's replay value, as the campaign plays out differently each time.<br/><br/>A stated goal of the developer was to fully immerse the player. The game featured a fully 3D U-Boat control room, allowing the player the freedom to move about the interior of the submarine. Unlike other submarine simulations, where the crew is often heard but not seen, Silent Hunter III allows the player to see and interact with crewmembers. The game also tracks the stats of individual crewmembers, such as rank, experience, morale, and decorations, between missions.<br/><br/>In addition, the game provides ten historical single-player missions.

The game allows players a variety of play modes including career, single war patrol and single battle engagements.<br/><br/>The simulation uses detailed and accurate 3D graphics to immerse the player in the environment of a World War II submarine. The systems of the vessel are largely functional and the player is exposed to many aspects of submarine warfare of the time. The game allows the player to choose how realistic and challenging the game experience is to be and it is designed to allow new players to easily master the basic game play, while allowing for experienced users to manually control systems such as crew management, torpedo allocation, radar, sonar and target trigonometry.<br/><br/>Like its predecessor Silent Hunter 3, the simulation features a fully dynamic campaign. The game gives players various mission objectives and unique rewards, and attempts to make each campaign a unique experience. The major naval battles of the war in the Pacific, such as the Battle of Midway are re-enacted and players are informed of them via in-game radio messages.

By effective speculation on the stock market, a player may take control of more than one corporation. Proper corporation management is preferable but not the most essential.<br/>The rules attempt to simulate real conditions of business competition and relationships between shareholders.<br/><br/>THERE IS NO LUCK FACTOR.<br/>Internal balance discourages to play in a relation of 2(3) players versus 1.<br/><br/>Most of the rules are quite easy and intuitive. It is the most difficult to use the rules effectively by good planning and predicting opponents&rsquo; plans.<br/>Players manage their corporations by investing in new factories and trading produced goods to earn money (like in many other games). The point is what the players do with earned money. They can re-invest it to make their corporations earn more during next phase or try to make pressure on another player by buying shares of his/her corporation. The player who has the biggest number of shares can be elected by voting as a new leader of the corporation for the next stage. Even if you don`t have enough shares to take control over another player`s firm, the investment can be quite beneficiary because it can give you some profit (if that firm is managed well) or enforce your opponent to use the corporation money for defending, which makes his final result worse than could be achieved without your pressure.<br/><br/>Of course, the more players (max 4), the more fun there is during voting phase when all the shareholders, who are going to manage the corporation in the next stage, vote.<br/><br/>The game tries to extract maximum advantage of double circulation of money you can find in the &quot;Imperial&quot;. Players have money and corporations have money. So, what is new then? Besides the players, also the corporations can be shareholders and they all (corporations and players) vote for new leaders. It means that if you want to keep control over a corporation you had started with, you can, for instance, first take control over some weaker corporation which has some shares of yours. The best defense is attack, isn`t it? ;) The only weapon in this war is money.<br/><br/>There are some tools of defense, so taking control over experienced opponent`s corporation is rather difficult, though possible.

A version for the Wii is also scheduled for simultaneous release - please the the VGG entry for NHL Slapshot for more details. EA's latest installment for Xbox 360 and PS3 delivers a brand new physics engine, which EA promise will ensure that every hit will be unique. Open ice hits have been improved, as well as checks from behind and against the boards. New expected clubs in the game are AIK Ishockey in Elitserien, which managed to qualify for the 2010-11 Elitserien season. This will mean that R&ouml;gle BK will be removed from the game, as they failed to qualify for the 2010-11 Elitserien season. Also included for the first time will be the sixty teams from the Canadian Hockey League (CHL). It is confirmed that CHL teams will also be a part of the Be A Pro and Be A GM modes, rather than simply being playable in &quot;Play Now&quot; games, like some of the European leagues<br/><br/>NHL11 is rated PEGI: 3+ in Europe, and is still pending ESRB rating in the US and OFLC rating in Oceania.<br/><br/>Faceoffs have been redesigned to allow for far more control than in NHL10. Players can now adjust their grip on their stick at the faceoff circle, and can of course attempt to take the puck in any direction, or even shield the puck from the opposing center to allow one of their wingers to come in and pick it up.<br/><br/>Broken sticks are a feature that EA has made a lot of noise about adding to NHL11. Along with a stick break comes the interaction between broken sticks on the ice and the other players on the ice, as well as pucks bouncing off sticks that have been left on the ice. Players without sticks can grab a new one from one of their teammates (important to make sure that the D are equipped) or of course fetch one from the bench.<br/><br/>Game Modes<br/>The game modes of NHL11 are very similar to those from NHL10:<br/><br/>Be a Pro Mode: Start your player in the AHL or NHL and build them up of consecutive seasons. Your character gains XP based on their performance and the league that they play in. This XP can then be used to boost the players skills across numerous offensive, defensive and athletic attributes.<br/><br/>Be a GM Mode: Almost RPG like in its style and feel. You are given a 3 year contract with a team of your choice. You can be fired! Many challenges await the would be General Manager: Salary Cap compliance, roster management, trades, trade rumours, trading block (feature that lets you set open preferences so that other teams have the information they need to make offers you want to receive). Contract buy outs, re-signing players, scouting assignments, draft picks, relationship management with the other GMS and GM power rankings. You can either play or sim as many of your AHL and NHL games as you wish.<br/><br/>Season mode: pick your favorite NHL team and play an entire season.<br/><br/>Practice Mode: hone your moves and practice your set plays. Create custom plays to be triggered when you're out on the ice.<br/><br/>Shootout mode: As skaters or goalie.<br/><br/>Soundtrack<br/>The songs featured in NHL 11 were chosen to replicate the &quot;feel of a live NHL experience&quot;.<br/><br/>1. &quot;Here I Stand&quot;   In Whispers   <br/>2. &quot;Bottom Of The Well&quot;   Airbourne   <br/>3. &quot;Your Betrayal&quot;   Bullet for My Valentine   <br/>4. &quot;Dialectic Chaos&quot;   Megadeth   <br/>5. &quot;Walk&quot;   Pantera   <br/>6. &quot;Full of Regret&quot;   Danko Jones   <br/>7. &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;   2 Unlimited   <br/>8. &quot;Strike It Up&quot;   Black Box   <br/>9. &quot;Mama Taught Me Better&quot;   Black Rebel Motorcycle Club   <br/>10. &quot;&iexcl;Ol&eacute;!&quot;   The Bouncing Souls   <br/>11. &quot;Sandstorm&quot;   Darude   <br/>12. &quot;Shipping Up To Boston (Live)&quot;   Dropkick Murphys   <br/>13. &quot;The Final Countdown&quot;   Europe   <br/>14. &quot;Unstoppable&quot;   Foxy Shazam   <br/>15. &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot;   Ramones   <br/>16. &quot;Howlin' For You&quot;   The Black Keys<br/><br/>"}, "75444": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Ca 1980"], "statistics": [], "name": "Ca 1980", "rpgdesigner": ["Martin Brod\u00e9n", "Anders Nygren", "Tobias Wrigstad"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic762969.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF archive"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Adult / Mature", "Crime"], "rpgpublisher": ["Vi \u00e5ker jeep"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)", "Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic762969_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher blurb:<br/><br/>User translation:<br/>Ca 1980 is a freeform role-playing game in three acts.

SMW2:YI is a platform game as it's predecessor Super Mario World. In this game, unlike previous Mario platform games, the player does not control Mario, but instead controls a dinosaur called Yoshi. Yoshi was introduced in Super Mario World, as a buddy of Mario.<br/><br/>In the game's introduction we see a stork on it's way to deliver baby Mario and baby Luigi to their parents. But Kamek, an evil magical koopa, intervenes and steals baby Luigi and the stork. Baby Mario falls down onto an Island called Yoshi's Island and lands on top of a green Yoshi. All the different colored Yoshi's then set out to get baby Luigi back from Kamek and his boss.<br/><br/>As with most new Mario platform games, this game features many innovative levels and original gameplay.<br/>Yoshi can eat enemies and then convert them to eggs. These eggs can be used to shoot at enemies and various other objects in the game. Whenever Yoshi gets hit by an enemy, he loses Baby Mario. Baby Mario then goes floating in the air in a bubble. Yoshi has to get Baby Mario back before a timer runs down, otherwise Baby Mario is taken away by Kamek's buddies, and the player loses a life. After getting baby Mario back, the timer counts back to ten. The timer can be extended to 30 seconds by collecting stars in the level.<br/><br/>The graphical style also differs from previous Mario games, by making it look as if all the graphics are hand-drawn with crayon. The game cartridge is equipped with a Super FX 2 chip which is used for various graphical effects, such as rotating, scaling, morphing, etc.<br/> The game was re-released on the Gameboy Advance Platform with the title &quot;Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3&quot; in 2002.<br/><br/>"}, "75447": {"rpgdesigner": ["Scott Aniolowski", "Shannon Appelcline", "Kerie Campbell", "Larry DiTillio", "Jeff Okamoto", "Sandy Petersen", "Kevin Ross", "Peter Schott", "Chris Williams (I)"], "rpgitemversion": ["\"The Complete Dreamlands\" 4th edition", "5th edition hardcover", "5th edition PDF", "5th edition softcover", "Les Contr\u00e9es du R\u00eave revisit\u00e9es", "German PDF version", "Krainy Snow", "Die Traumlande Limited Edition"], "poll": [], "name": "H.

Its unusual features for an arcade game included passwords and characters that could be saved, enabling players to play over the course of a long period of time.<br/><br/>Story<br/><br/>In ages past, a corrupt mage named Garm used a set of Runestones to summon a demon named Skorne (It is not stated what Garm intended to use Skorne for; however, as Gauntlet Legends introduces Garm as a &quot;greedy young mage&quot;, it can be assumed he wanted Skorne for his own personal gain.) However, Skorne crushed Garm and imprisoned his soul in the Underworld. Skorne, fearing the power of the Runestones, scattered them throughout the four realms, so that they could never be used against him. The player(s) must defeat the end bosses of each of the four realms to obtain the four golden keys which allow access to Skorne's temple. While traveling through each realm, he/she/they must also collect the Thirteen Runestones from where they have been scattered. The complete set of Runestones allows him/her/them to pursue Skorne to the Underworld in order to finally destroy him.

Yoshi's head is always visible, and accidentally shooting at him causes a loss of health and he turns to give you a dirty look. The Super Scope can be fired automatically, which quickly drains power. The RPM of the Super Scope would decrease when its Power Meter was close to empty. When completely empty, it will continue firing but only one shot at a time if the Fire Button was still held down, signifying that the player needs to release the fire button and let it recharge. There are two fire flowers in the game, and collecting them increased the amount of time that the scope could shoot before needing to recharge.<br/><br/>Yoshi's Safari puts emphasis on platforming, and at times, it is imperative to jump (via the cursor button) in order to avoid some obstacles. Also, there are branching paths that lead to different enemies, mini-bosses, or prizes, though they always end in the same main road, which leads to a boss. The bosses can be the Koopalings, with some of them piloting mechs; bigger versions of normal enemies (such as a big Magikoopa or the Big Boo); or Bowser himself, wearing a suit of armor equipped with two Gun-Hands and a devastating energy cannon located in the stomach.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, a code for a harder game is given to use at the title screen.

The aim is always the same: Destroy the enemies space fleet. Each mission has a different location, which may affect ship effectiveness due to local spatial anomalies and nebulas. You will fight against a fleet of fixed cost and number of pilots, and you will have to design a custom fleet for each battle, as both the situation, and the enemy fleet you face will be different for each mission<br/><br/>The game looks like an RTS in some screenshots, but is much more like a 'tower defense' game, in that you are not directly controlling your units, but placing them pre-battle and issuing orders. Imagine tower-defense, but with moving towers that you can design from scratch, in space, with cool laser effects. That is a fair approximation of Gratuitous Space Battles. You do not have control of individual ships during battle. The battle phase of the game is for visual feedback of how your fleet did.

As with the previous game, Mario Teaches Typing 2 was designed to teach children to type. In it, Mario and Luigi must recover the pieces of a magical typewriter that was destroyed when Mario incorrectly typed a magical phrase which would destroy Bowser's castle on it. When all the pieces are recovered and the typewriter is repaired, Mario is able to type the phrase correctly and destroy Bowser's castle. The game also features a number of Claymation sequences featuring a disembodied Mario head who talks to the player. Players can choose to select to take a placement test (which is scored based upon accuracy and speed) or participate in lessons (whether in order or selected individually). Also, the sequel has numerous new features, including a customizable certificate of achievement, color coded on-screen keyboard, and customizable lesson plans.
