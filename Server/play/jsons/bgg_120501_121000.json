It was available only via mail order by sending in proofs of purchase to Purina.<br/><br/>Chase the Chuck Wagon is a maze game. The object of each maze screen is to move Chuckie, the dog, through mazes of four different designs and escape through the opening directly below the chuckwagon. The player has limited time (60 or 30 seconds depending on the difficulty setting) per maze to accomplish this.<br/>There are two obstacles in each maze: the dog catcher moves through the maze, and if he touches Chuckie, the player loses one life; the bouncing object (bone, etc.) travels back and forth across the maze unhindered by the maze walls, and if it touches Chuckie, he will be frozen momentarily (signified by the maze changing color), making it more difficult to reach the end of maze within the time limit or avoid the dog catcher.[2]<br/>After successfully completing a maze screen, the maze clears and the reward screen appears. A dog dish drops from the Chuckwagon, and the player must use the joystick to orient Chuckie left or right to face the dish, and press the fire button at the right moment to stop it horizontal to Chuckie, allowing him to move to the dish and eat. This scores an additional 100 points.[3][4] If the player misses, no points are awarded and the game advances to the next maze screen.[5] If the player does not press the fire button, the dish falls repeatedly and the game does not advance.<br/>The player starts the game with three Chuckies. Chuckies are lost when time runs out on a maze on upon contact with the dog catcher. The game ends when all the Chuckies are exhausted.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Chase the Chuck Wagon&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "120840": {"poll": [], "name": "Mangia", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Atari 2600 edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1619950.png", "videogametheme": ["Food / Cooking"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Spectravideo"], "videogamegenre": ["Other"], "videogameplatform": ["Atari 2600"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Spectravideo"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1619950_t.png", "description": "Mangia (also styled Mangia', with a trailing apostrophe) is a 1983 video game by Spectravision for the Atari 2600 video game console. <br/>The player gets to control a young boy, who must eat plates of pasta placed in front of him by his mother, who will keep feeding him until his stomach explodes on-screen.<br/>To prevent this, the player can, instead of eating the pasta, throw it to a cat, who occasionally appears at the window, and a dog, who walks across the bottom of the screen.

One Piece: Pirates' Carnival comprises over 30 different minigames, which support up to four players, and includes a Reversi-like board game mode in which winning minigames lets you take control of squares and recruit pirates for your ship's crew.<br/><br/>The main style of gameplay is the Board Game, which features a massive gameboard consisting of dozens of panels. The objective of the game is to have as much money as possible when every tile belongs to a player. Each player has two varieties of money - the money earned from winning a minigame and the money earned from simply owning a panel. Note that while the latter is easily increased (and just as easily decreased), only three effects in the entire game can affect the former.<br/><br/>Each of the four players take turns uncovering panels around the gameboard; who goes first is determined by a minigame at the beginning that takes place at the center panel. While at the beginning, players can only uncover panels that are close to the central one, as the game goes on, more panels may be uncovered. A panel owned by a player is marked by being bordered with the player's colors; if the color is gray, then nobody owns it and anyone can select it.<br/><br/>There are 5 kinds of boards in the game, each one representation a place from the story. The shape and size of each board is different for the others'.  They are based in East Blue, Calm Belt to Alabasta, Skypiea, Water 7 and Longring Longland.<br/><br/>There are three types of panels on the gameboard:<br/><br/>Event: These panels, when uncovered, results in the player who uncovered them immediately gaining ownership of them. All event panels have some sort of effect, from increasing/decreasing the player's money to gaining ownership of a panel that an opponent owns.<br/><br/>Mini-Game: These panels, when uncovered, list a trio of minigames, one of which the player that uncovered it chooses to engage in with all the other players. The winner of the minigame gains ownership of the panel.<br/><br/>Captain: These panels, when uncovered, result in a special minigame where the player who uncovers them plays as the captain of the game, and follows different rules than all the other players. If the captain wins, the player who uncovered the panel earns ownership of it, while if one of the other players win, they gain ownership of it. Note that captain panels are always found in pairs, and that if a player gains ownership of one, the other is also revealed and brought under ownership of him/her. Similarly, captain panels also change ownership/get destroyed/get frozen in unison.<br/><br/>Note that if two panels of the same color are in line with one another, all uncovered panels between them with different colors switch to the color of the two panels on the edges, and are brought under ownership of the player with the color.<br/><br/>Any game that the player has participated is automatically added to the Versus Game section, to be played whenever they feel like it. The games are classified into these categories:<br/>[edit] Mini-Game<br/><br/>Usually only uncovered by the Mini-Game panel. These include:<br/><br/>Ship Battle Royale: Players battle each other onboard the Going Merry.<br/><br/>Pirates' Concentration: Players take turns flipping over tiles featuring members of the Straw Hat crew on a giant raft, searching for matches.<br/><br/>Going Merry Shooting Gallery: Players use the Going Merry's cannon to shoot islands &amp; ships to gain points.<br/><br/>The Great Smoke Escape: Players search for keys in the Loguetown Marine HQ while avoiding Smoker/Chaser.<br/><br/>Snowcap Battle Hiking: Players climb up the Drum Rockies, encountering various obstacles (such as hiking bears and Lapahns) along the way.<br/><br/>Yuba Sand Digout: Players dig for water in Yuba while avoiding sandstorms.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Dugong Punch Out: Players have their own territory and take out the Kung-Fu Dugongs in order to win with less Dugongs.<br/><br/>Supersonic Ledge Race: Players ride spot-billed ducks up the Alubarna Plateau.<br/><br/>Sunken Treasure Salvage: Players explore a sunken ship in diving suits, searching for treasure while avoiding the punches of Masira.<br/><br/>Balloon Dive Chicken Race: Players use the octopus balloon to descend from Skypeia and onto the Going Merry.<br/><br/>Battle of the Long Stilts: Players walk within a ring on massive stilts, attempting to knock each other over.<br/><br/>Where Is Pandaman?: Players use a telescope to search for Pandaman in a large crowd.<br/>[edit] Straw Hat Members' Games<br/><br/>Unlike the other Captain Games, the Straw Hats' panels cannot be uncovered in a board game. The only way to play these games is to challenge a member's tile over a Davy Back Fight.<br/><br/>In &quot;Gum Gum Carnival&quot;, players try to select certain beats in a tune while avoid being hit by Luffy. The last one standing is the winner.<br/><br/>&quot;Thundering Swordplay&quot; is played in a ring, which is slippery from the rain. There, players must put Zolo out of the ring. Whoever defeats Zolo, or if Zolo defeats them, wins.<br/><br/>In &quot;Roguetown Treasure Chase&quot;, Nami is chased by players on the streets of Roguetown. The players who successfully steals Nami's treasure three times, or Nami making it to the Going Merry, is the winner.<br/><br/>In &quot;Defend Usopp Factory!&quot;, players attempt to steal treasure from one of three doors. Usopp stands in the middle, and must choose a door to protect.<br/><br/>&quot;Cooking Fighter&quot; is played in the Baratie, where the players attempt to steal food aboard the Baratie as Sanji throws it to Patty. Forks can be used to slow down the other players. Whoever steals three dishes, or if Sanji delivers five dishes to Patty, wins.<br/><br/>&quot;Wave the Pirate Flag!&quot; takes place in Drum Island, where the players attempt to steal a pirate flag from Chopper upon Drum Castle and wave it to fill a gauge. Chopper himself must place the flag upon each of the castle's seven sections and turn the snow pink.<br/><br/>In &quot;The Ancient Ruin Mystery&quot;, players attempt to steal treasure from the ruins of Shandora and bring it back to their own camp while Robin is deciphering ponecliffs. The player who acquires 100,000 berries, or completely deciphers the ponecliffs, wins.<br/>[edit] Captain Games<br/><br/>The player who uncovers a captain tile gets to play as the captain. All the other players face off against them in a mini-game. Once in a while, captains will mutiny, and all four players battle against them.<br/><br/>Chop-Chop Festival: Players battle Buggy by stepping on either his head or lower body. Buggy himself can attack of his own will and go into a &quot;berserker&quot; mode whenever he is hit. Mohji and Cabaji will also be firing cannonballs at the players.<br/><br/>The Cat Out of the Bag: Players battle Kuro in Kaya's front yard while avoiding Jango's hypnosis. Kuro himself can create a trail of light when he starts running, and can surround players with it, attacking them all at once with his &quot;Out of the Bag Attack&quot;.<br/><br/>Beware the MH5!: Players jump across the pieces of Baratie's fins and Krieg's ship to reach Don Krieg himself. The entire stage is covered with poison gas, and players must periodically acquire gas masks to deplete their poison meter, or they will die. Krieg himself can hinder players with spears and (if he acquires one) bombs.<br/><br/>Arlong Darts Park: Players engage in a game of darts at Arlong Park. Arlong himself takes his turn after all three players, and only gets three shots as opposed to the other players getting four. However, he can knock down other players' darts to steal their points, and the three spots that he chose form a triangle. Any darts within the triangle instantly have their score stolen by Arlong.<br/><br/>Little Garden Bomb Battle: Players battle the giants Dorry and Brogy on Little Garden by tossing bombs at the giants' feet. Dorry and Broggy can retaliate by stepping on the players, guided by a skull mark.<br/><br/>Wapol's Munch-Munch Factory: Players battle a rotating Wapol (in the center of the stage) by hitting his heart, which pops out at a random spot every time he attacks. In addition to using cannons and hammers, Wapol can also devour anyone who he is facing, filling up a gauge. When the gauge is filled, Wapol can engage in a secret technique that attacks all opponents.<br/><br/>Clone-Clone Panel Shootout: Players engage in a guessing game with Mr. 2 Bon Kurei at the Sandora River, trying to guess which face he has transformed into.<br/><br/>Mr. 4's Batter Up!: Players attempt to deflect exploding baseballs that Mr. 4 hits toward them. In addition to normal baseball bombs, Mr. 4 can also have Lassoo sneeze out up to three &quot;tornado shots&quot; that automatically explode.<br/><br/>Crocodile's Sand Trap: Players battle Crocodile with water guns while attempting to not get sucked into the &quot;Desert Girasole&quot;. Crocodile himself can dodge water shots and retaliate with Desert Spada and sandstorms.<br/><br/>Chomp It Up! Pie Eatout: Players engage in a pie-eating contest with Blackbeard, and must avoid bombs. Blackbeard himself can use an apple bomb whenever Doc Q shows up, causing three apples to appear before each of the players, at least one of which is a bomb (the exploding apples do not reveal themselves until a few seconds later).<br/><br/>Spring Hopper Daredevil: Players attempt to dodge Bellamy's bouncing attacks in Mock Town while trying to make it through all three sections. Bellamy himself creates a hole in the dock wherever he lands if he does not hit anybody, and these holes cause instant death if a player falls through them. If two or more have survived all three sections of Mock Town, Bellamy goes into a frenzied &quot;Spring Hopper&quot; that does not stop until there is only one player left standing.<br/><br/>Wiper Strikes!: Players must stop Wiper from destroying the Going Merry by absorbing his bazooka shots. Wiper himself can fire an extra-potent shot if he stops firing for a while.<br/><br/>Illusion Forest, Ordeal of Orbs: Players must knock exploding Surprise Orbs toward Satori. Satori himself can either deflect them with his cane or connect Surprise Orbs to the one that he is standing on, and once he has connected four, he can use the Orb Dragon technique, which allows him to hurt players just by touching them.<br/><br/>Light the Shandorian Fire!: Players must reach the Golden Bell by climbing up Giant Jack and avoiding a rotating thunder cloud. Enel follows the players on another cloud, and attacks them with &quot;30,000,000 Volt Hino&quot; (which is horizontal) and &quot;El Thor&quot; (which is vertical).<br/><br/>The Suitcase Scramble: Players must take three suitcases full of money back to their own area. Smoker/Chaser (Paulie in the Japanese version) snatches the suitcases away from the players. Hammers can be used to attack other players, attack Smoker, or knock a suitcase out of another player's area.<br/><br/>Chop-Chop Harpoon Mayhem!: Players collect treasure while avoiding Buggy's attacks (Franky's attacks in the Japanese version) and the junk fired out of the cannons. Buggy can grab players and toss them into the cannon, firing them out.<br/><br/>Pandaman's Panic Maze: Players avoid flames while breaking down doors in a maze-like burning mansion. When a blue arrow appears, players can escape the mansion by getting to it in time. Pandaman (Blueno in the Japanese version) travels through walls to attack the players, and can alter the direction of the flames up to three times.<br/><br/>Twirling Whips of Flame: Players must avoid Mohji &amp; Cabaji (Kaku &amp; Kalifa in the Japanese version) running over them with a whip while attempting to toss them into a fire. Mohji and Cabaji can stop at any time and start spinning in a circle, increasing the range of their attack.<br/><br/>Lucci's game (Original version only): Players run through a devastated and burning Galley-la building, while Rob Lucci chases them and attempts to stop them by throwing burning furniture and utilizing his Rokushiki techniques.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;One Piece: Pirates Carnival&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "120878": {"poll": [], "name": "Bomberman Max 2", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Game Boy Advance edition", "North American Game Boy Advance edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Other", "Puzzle"], "videogamegenre": ["Action"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Hudson Soft"], "videogamefranchise": ["Bomberman"], "videogameplatform": ["Game Boy Advance"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Majesco Entertainment"], "description": "Bomberman Max 2 is a video game released for the Game Boy Advance on June 4, 2002.

Those vegetables are then harvested and taken to the local market where players sell to the waiting customers.<br/><br/>A game of Matakana takes place over rounds of two distinct phases: Gardening &amp; Harvesting.<br/><br/>GARDENING PHASE<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the Gardening phase, players will compete with each other to take a row of cards that will allow them to cultivate their garden. The cards that players collect are:<br/><br/>1) Gnome cards - allows players to collect gnomes which act as a currency of sorts when planting seeds<br/><br/>2) Soil cards - allows players to take soil tiles and lay them in their garden (soil tiles come in various shapes and sizes and you will need them before you can plant any seeds)<br/><br/>3) Sunshine cards - dictates which columns in your garden you are able to plant seeds in this round.<br/><br/>Depending on the draw of the cards some rows will be more lucrative than others and it will be up to the players to decide when is time to compete for those cards. Once players have collected their cards they will lay soil and plant seeds according to those cards.<br/><br/>HARVESTING PHASE<br/><br/><br/><br/>The second phase of the round involves rolling 3 regular dice to determine which column of your garden will harvest vegetables.  The player rolling the dice choices a pair of dice from the roll and the sum of those dice is the column in the garden that all players can harvest.  Players then take vegetable cards that match the seeds they have planted into their hand.<br/><br/>Players will now have an opportunity to openly trade with each other for vegetables that they do not have.  Players will do this to sell a certain group of vegetables to waiting customers at the local market.  The market is a 9x9 grid made up of 9 customers of varying colours.  Each of these customers is wanting different combinations of vegetables and the players who can serve that customer with the vegetables that they are wanting will take that &quot;Customer&quot; and place it face up in front of them.<br/><br/>SCORING<br/><br/><br/><br/>Once the deck of Customers runs out the game will end and players will tally up their scores.  Points are given for:<br/><br/>1) Creating full columns of seeds in their garden<br/>2) Having the majority of Customers of a certain colour (with points available for those in 2nd and 3rd)<br/>3) Having the most money at the end of the game<br/><br/>To do well in Matakana requires a player to do well in all areas of the game: creating a bountiful garden that harvests often, trading wisely with other players to ensure you have the vegetables that you need and finally, keeping an eye on what customers other players are serving so that you can maximize your scoring opportunities.<br/><br/>A game of Matakana takes approximately 60-90 minutes and players 3-5 players.<br/><br/>"}, "120889": {"poll": [], "name": "Ice Breaker", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Spanish Amstrad CPC Cassette edition", "Spanish Amstrad CPC Floppy Disk edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Post-Apocalyptic"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Topo Soft"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade", "Racing"], "videogameplatform": ["Amstrad CPC"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Erbe Software, S.A."], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>In 4003, Earth was attacked by a giant machine, Corvell, which triggered a new ice age.

In Greekopoly the object of the game is for the players to travel around the board collecting colonies (fraternities &amp; sororities), build on these, and force other players to go broke. (Players have to pay dues when landing on other player's properties.) When only one solvent player is left, that player is the Winner.<br/><br/>There are several interesting wrinkles in this title. Unlike in Monopoly where the properties for a neighborhood are within a few spaces of each other, Greekopoly Triads (a combination of 2 fraternities &amp; 1 sorority of the same color) are distributed on different sides of the board. In order to start building on these properties all the properties of a Triad must be owned by the same player. There are also Independent Colonies. Players may build on these without owning other properties, but only when they land on them. (This is in contrast to a Triad which may be built on at the rate of one building or upgrade per turn.) Other properties, simply referred to as Independents (like Greek Sportswear, Campus Pub, etc.) can be bought, but may not be built on.<br/><br/>The game's IFC cards and TGIF cards fulfill the roll that Community Chest &amp; Chance have in classic Monopoly. They introduce the role of chance (with positive and negative outcomes) with the draw of a card. There are also some special spaces on the board, some positive, and some negative&hellip; like the Dean's Office, where a player may be stuck so long he has to forfeit one of his Colonies.<br/><br/>This title was clearly meant to capitalize on the enduring popularity of the 1978 film National Lampoon's Animal House&quot; while skirting the need to pay licensing fees.

Meanwhile, Pac-Man is celebrating his 25th birthday with his family when he is teleported by Orson, a former nemesis of Pac-Man from the first Pac-Man World video game. Orson communicates to him and tells him about the Spectral Realm (after Pac-Man complains to Orson about messing up his party and throwing him into a trash pit). Pac-Man is attacked by fiery Spectral monsters of the orange, green, and purple varieties which have been driven mad by Erwin's hypnosis with Inky and Blinky have been kidnapped as part of Erwin's evil scheme, but Pinky and Clyde managed to escape.

A North American version was planned with the working title Ape Escape 2001, but it was canceled.<br/><br/>Piposaru 2001's Gameplay differs from the original Ape Escape gameplay outline. The left analog stick on the DualShock controller is used to control Spike's movement, but unlike the original game, the right analog stick was unused and the Face buttons were used to attack. The goal of each level is to use a vacuum cleaner to remove a required amount of pants off of the apes and put them into an oversized washing machine, while preventing the monkeys from re-obtaining their shorts or attacking the player. While sucking the pant off a monkey, the monkey can be fired into other monkeys to knock them out. Bomb tokens can also be collected to attack monkeys and bosses. The graphics were slightly improved yet very similar to the original game, with the same symbols throughout the game (such as the stage cleared symbol). Also (like the first), it was made for a broader audience from ages 5 onwards, unlike Ape Escape 2 &amp; Ape Escape 3 which was intended for younger audiences. Also, Piposaru 2001 was the first game in the series to feature no other enemies excluding the apes.<br/><br/>The storyline is a simpler compared to the original game. Specter has made all the monkeys' pants dirty and Spike/ Kakeru has to wash them. Although the storyline &amp; controls were simple, the levels of the game were designed rather well. It also featured many more levels than the original game. It has 36 stages while the original had only 19. Each level is timed. The storyline changed and is a similar game style to Ape Escape Pumped &amp; Primed. There are five stages to complete, and then a boss battle in each level.

The stadiums and crowds have been reworked for added realism. Some components such as flares, stadium shadows and multi-tired stadiums made their first appearances in the series.  The game includes FIFPro licenses for 53 National teams and 32 Club teams; including unlicensed names for six hidden teams and 33 hidden players.<br/><br/>Goalkeepers are much smarter, actually saving headers on occasion and not letting in quite as many howlers as past iterations in the series. In terms of shooting and passing, little seems to have changed. Lobbed shots can still be performed by either double-tapping shoot or pressing L1 in conjunction with the shoot button. Players run even more intelligently off the ball than before, and the ball itself seems to react more unpredictably than ever&mdash;rolling through players' legs, ricocheting off defenders, and even occasionally bouncing favorably (some would say luckily) for a player.<br/><br/>Scoring is no simple affair, requiring equal doses of strategy, planning, and skill. Charging blindly toward an opponent's goal area will usually result in the player being dispossessed. Intelligent passing, individual skill, and a little touch of magic are the ingredients for success, making the act of scoring a truly enjoyable moment instead of a routine formality. Blasting a 30-yard strike home is just as satisfying as a well-worked play, as are the many other methods of scoring, be they skilful runs through the midfield or fortunate deflections off a defender.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "120927": {"poll": [], "name": "Pro Evolution Soccer 2", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European PlayStation 2 edition", "Japanese PlayStation 2 edition", "North American PlayStation 2 edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2026294.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Pro Evolution Soccer"], "videogametheme": ["Sports - Soccer"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "usersrated": "4", "videogamedeveloper": ["Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo (KCET)"], "videogamefranchise": ["ISS/PES"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2"], "videogamehonor": ["2003 Golden Joystick PlayStation Game of the Year Nominee", "2003 Japan Game Awards Game of the Year Winner"], "average": "7.25", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Konami"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2026294_t.jpg", "description": "Pro Evolution Soccer 2 (known as Winning Eleven 6 in Japan and World Soccer: Winning Eleven 6 in North America) is the second installment of Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer football video game series.

The game is a prequel to the 1984 game Tir Na Nog as the story takes place before that game, when Cuchulainn was still alive. The background history is based on Celtic folklore about the hero Cuchulainn, and his battles against the people of Connachta in ancient Ireland.<br/><br/>Dun Darach is an arcade adventure with interface and presentation nearly identical to Tir Na Nog or Marsport based on collecting objects, solving puzzles based on word puns or lateral thinking and interacting with other characters wandering through the city. The animation is in the same standard as Tir Na Nog, although there is no parallax scrolling. Since the game can take many hours to complete, there is support for saving its state to cassette tape.<br/><br/>Dun Darach improves over its predecessor in that other characters can give short hints to the player, rob him, and confiscate his belongings if he carries stolen goods. The player can also now buy, steal and sell goods from the many shops in the city, bet at a casino (Iomain Ludum) and even deposit money at a bank with daily compound interest. The city of Dun Darach is large and consists of different quarters with shops and the current time of the day is indicated by torches in the wall and by the greetings of characters. There is a &quot;blank&quot; area in the centre of the city in Iomain, the pleasure quarter; this was originally intended to be a brothel called &quot;Lady Q's&quot; and would have opened into a whole red-light district (this was censored and all that remains is a sign saying &quot;Forbidden&quot;). Cuchulainn can move north, south, east and west with the player &quot;rotating&quot; the view using the keyboard and then having Cuchulainn move left or right on the screen, so only one side of the street is visible at once.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Dun Darach,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "120936": {"poll": [], "name": "Time For Epic: Heroes in Time!

It was published by Gargoyle Games in the United Kingdom and Dro Soft in Spain.<br/><br/>Marsport was intended to be the first part of a trilogy called &quot;The Siege of Earth&quot; but parts two and three (Fornax and Gath) were not forthcoming. Because of this, it is often regarded as being part of an unofficial trilogy alongside Tir Na Nog and Dun Darach (both of which are part of the same official series) due to its having very similar gameplay to these titles. Marsport also has similarities to the later Gargoyle game, Heavy on the Magick.<br/><br/>The year is 2494. For seventy years, the Earth has been under siege by the insectoid Sept. Since the siege began, the Sept have been kept at bay by a huge Force Sphere which surrounds the Earth and the Moon. However, the Sept are on the verge of discovering how to breach the Sphere unless it can be strengthened according to the formulae contained in the original plans. Unfortunately, these plans are concealed somewhere in the Martian city of Marsport, now Sept-occupied and booby-trapped by the city's M-Central computer. One man, Commander John Marsh, has been sent to retrieve the plans in the belief that a determined man can sometimes achieve more than an army.<br/><br/>Marsport effectively has three distinct objectives: 1) Locate the M-Central computer; Marsport is a three-dimensional city, where levels are connected by express tube, which will take you up or down, but probably not both. In addition, many sections of the city cannot be reached until specific problems have been solved. 2) Gain access to the original Sphere plans, held in M-Central's inner sanctum. This will require re-exploration of Marsport, for having achieved the first objective, you will find that many parts of the city, previously unreachable, will now be open to you. 3) Leave the city of Marsport with the plans intact, which may prove the hardest task of all...<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Marsport,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "120939": {"poll": [], "name": "Mystery Manor: Hidden Adventure", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android Release", "iOS Release"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1244598.png", "videogametheme": ["Occult"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Game Insight"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Game Insight"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1244598_t.png", "description": "&quot;A dreadful Event took place in the Manor and completely ruined the ordinary life of its inhabitants.

So it's a blind-bidding, trick-taking, deck-building hybrid.<br/><br/>The 144 cards in the deck depict events in the amazing life of the great electrical genius, Nikola Tesla, one of the inventors of our modern age. Following the successes and pitfalls of his life story, each player in this game attempts to accumulate the greatest amount of Voltage (victory points) before the deck runs too low.<br/><br/>In keeping with the theme, many aspects of the game are in threes, and victory points are measure in Millions of Volts (A.C., of course).<br/><br/>Each player begins with an &quot;Input Deck&quot; of nine cards. From this they deal themselves a hand of six to play the round. Each round then consists of three tricks. The first trick consists of (A) drawing three &quot;prize cards&quot; from the main deck that the players will try to win and (B) each player chooses three cards from their hand to bid, trying to win those cards. (Sometimes, if the &quot;prize&quot; is undesirable, a player may play low to intentionally lose the trick.) The winner gets the prize cards, and all players keep the cards they played, which go into their &quot;Output Deck&quot; (discard) for future use.<br/><br/>The second trick in the round uses TWO prize cards and each player plays TWO cards from their hand to the trick. Finally the last trick is a One-Card trick. And again, prize cards go to the player's own Output Deck, and all other cards are recycled by each player.<br/><br/>In succeeding rounds, when a player's Input Deck is depleted, their Output Deck is shuffled and placed face-down to become the new supply for their hand. This way, the prize cards come into play as the game progresses. Some cards are &quot;Power Cards&quot; which cause extra draws, discards, and actions to be taken which add extra value to one's hand, and can hinder an opponent's efforts.<br/><br/>The winning is determined after all cards have been won. Some cards are &quot;Positive&quot; and some &quot;Negative&quot; scoring cards, and several have special point values. The suited cards do not have a scoring value UNLESS the player has acquired a &quot;Value for your Voltage&quot; card, which gives those cards points at the end. Therefore, gaining those during the game (even though they have no value until the end) can make the difference in a winning or losing score.<br/><br/>Now available at Amazon.com and RedHenToys.com !<br/><br/>"}, "120949": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Shane Hendrickson"], "poll": [], "name": "Antipode", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Point to Point Movement"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Antipode is played on a 5-hexagon, with elements of Hex, Othello, Yinsh<br/><br/>On a turn a player places a token of his color, flipping any adjacent tokens (ala Othello).<br/><br/>And the second step of your turn is to move your pawn.

There are six cards of each number 1 through 6 and six &quot;Wild Cards&quot;.   Everyone (from two to six players) starts with a handful of dime-sized cardboard discs, each of their own color.  A special green playing mat is placed in the center of the playing area.  It contains places for cards and a grid for the betting discs.  The dealer deals out a predetermined number of cards depending on the number of players, and each player lays three cards in the &quot;Down&quot; space in front of him on the game mat.<br/><br/>The first player will add a card to their &quot;Down&quot; stack and place a bid of at least two of any number one through six by putting a disc on the grid  in the proper row and column to indicate their bid.  In turn around the board, each player must make a higher bid or challenge the bid just made.  The bids reflect the combined total number of cards in everyone's &quot;Down&quot;  stack having the same number on the card as the bid  (including &quot;Wild Cards&quot;).   For example: a bid of 4 fives, means that a player thinks there are at least 4 cards containing the number five (or &quot;wild&quot;) in the collective total of everyone's &quot;Down&quot; stack.  Players may bluff in their bidding in an effort to outwit the other players.<br/><br/>When a challenge occurs, the other players (in turn) get to place a higher bid or allow the challenging player go through with the challenge.  If no higher bids are placed, the cards from everyone's &quot;Down&quot; stack are revealed to see if the bid was successful or not.  Standard poker chips are used to keep score.  The winner is the player with the most chips after the predetermined number of rounds have been played or some other end-game condition occurs.

A switch in the back of the photo-frame can be used to transform the photo into that of a vampire, and the object of the game is to avoid receiving three bite marks, thereby being the last remaining human.<br/><br/>Game play occurs in turns with players moving a dry erase vampire marker/mover around a simple game board. In turn, each player rolls three dice marked with crows and moves the marker/mover zero to three spaces clockwise, depending on the number of crows rolled. The space the marker lands on allows the player to use the top portion of the vampire mover to apply a dry erase vampire bite stamp to another player's photo-frame, erase one of his or her own vampire bites with the supplied dry erase pad, swap photos with another player, or gain control of the Family Crest Ring which protects that player from vampire bites. A roll of zero crows does not move the marker, instead automatically gaining control of the Family Crest Ring for the player who rolled the zero.<br/><br/>When a player receives the third vampire bite on his photo-frame, he can no longer win the game, erase bites, swap photos or possess the Family Crest Ring. However, he can remain in the game, taking turns as normal, but only dealing out vampire bites as allowed.

ZIP file contains both a book fold and on-screen version of the Guide (48 half-pages/24 full pages) and the Appendix (68 half-pages/34 full pages).<br/><br/>[Publisher Blurb]<br/><br/>"}, "120588": {"poll": [], "name": "Dear Esther", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Linux Downloadable edition", "Macintosh Downloadable edition", "North American PlayStation 4 edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1346610.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Puzzle"], "usersrated": "56", "videogamedeveloper": ["thechineseroom"], "videogamegenre": ["Walking Simulator"], "videogameplatform": ["Linux", "Macintosh", "PlayStation 4", "Windows"], "videogamehonor": ["2012 AzPlay Awards Most Original Game Idea Winner", "2012 IGF Awards (Nuovo) Best Innovation of the Year Nominee", "2012 IGF Awards Excellence In Audio Nominee", "2012 IGF Awards Excellence In Visual Art Winner", "2012 IGF Awards Seumas McNally Grand Prize Nominee", "2013 British Academy Game Awards Best Art Direction of the Year Nominee", "2013 British Academy Game Awards Best Audio of the Year Nominee", "2013 British Academy Game Awards Best British Game of the Year Nominee", "2013 British Academy Game Awards Best Debut Game of the Year Nominee"], "average": "6.24393", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "Limited Run Games"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1346610_t.jpg", "description": "&ldquo;A deserted island&hellip; a lost man&hellip; memories of a fatal crash&hellip; a book written by a dying explorer.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Dear Esther is a ghost story, told using first-person gaming technologies.

The player has a deck of 35 cards: robots of Moloch (such as the Gauss Cannon, Clown, or Juggernaut), modules to attach to the robots (Network module, Kasparov module), and special cards (such as Push back, or Move). He plays those cards in the cities he passes while moving toward NY, trying to turn human settlements into dust while preparing for the final battle.<br/><br/>The other player commands the Outpost troops, attacking the convoy and trying to slow it down. The Outpost deck also contains 35 cards: soldiers (such as Runner or HG), buildings (such as Bunker or EMP Cannon), and many special cards (Move, Retreat, Medic). The Outpost has to win a few battles, slow down the march of Moloch as much as possible, and prepare to welcome robots in New York City.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "French first edition", "German first edition", "Polish first edition", "Polish second editon", "Portal Games English edition", "Z-Man English edition"], "average": "6.88316", "name": "Neuroshima: Convoy", "playingtime": "40", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Hand Management", "Take That"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "668", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Neuroshima"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["2-Player Board Games Review Special", "Essen 2015 - Portal Games"]}, "120606": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1274617.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Olivier Finet"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2006", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Ysha"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Defifoo SA", "Gigamic"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1274617_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "description": "The game is played in 5 rounds for which the number of cards per player changes each time (7,8,9,8,7).<br/><br/>Each player bets on the number of tricks that he hoped to get.<br/>There are 5 colors with the numbers 1 to 9 and knight, king,  executioner (0 or 10 depending on the player's choice), dragon and the witch who are are stronger (except in the last 3 turn or they are worthless).<br/><br/>The first player commits a color, the others should play the same color and bigger card to take the trick.<br/>At the end of the game everyone counts the number of tricks performed. if the bet is won, the player multiplies the &quot;tricks&quot; by two and adds it to his 100 points.

NASCAR 2005 is the first game in the series to drop the word Thunder from the title since NASCAR 2001. Kevin Harvick, driver of the #29 GM Goodwrench Chevy Monte Carlo, appeared on the cover. It also marks the first time the original PlayStation has been excluded from the NASCAR lineup. This was the first NASCAR edition to be released exclusively on six generation home consoles.<br/><br/>Unlike previous entries, which would normally add a few extra features but leave most of the game identical to its predecessor, the game brought massive change to the series. One example is the inclusion of NASCAR series other than the NEXTEL Cup Series; the National Series (Busch Series), the Craftsman Truck Series, and the Featherlite Modified Series, plus muscle cars. More examples include the implementation of NASCAR's new Chase for the Cup points system, and Fight to the Top mode, where you control a custom driver throughout his career starting in the lower series and working up the ladder (similar to NASCAR: Dirt to Daytona). Another change is the absence of the cockpit view and the absence of makes and models in the Truck series, all of which appear to be Ford F-150s. This was the last NASCAR game released for the Nintendo GameCube.<br/><br/>While a large number of real drivers are present in the NEXTEL Cup Series, Busch Series, and Craftsman Truck Series in NASCAR 2005: Chase for the Cup, fantasy drivers are still present, sponsored by fictional or unused sponsors. However, the Whelen Modified Tour is entirely made up of Fantasy drivers. Dale Earnhardt is the only legend in the game and can be unlocked by buying his Thunder Plate or via cheat code or choosing him as favorite driver.<br/><br/>Lightning Challenge mode includes challenges of moments that happened in NASCAR from 2003 and the 1st part of 2004. Michael Waltrip, driver of the #15 NAPA Chevrolet, returns as the commentator for all the challenges except for two, Kevin Harvick does the challenges that involve Michael being the driver in the challenge. These challenges are played on all difficulty levels. The player must beat a number of challenges at that difficulty level before going to the next difficulty level.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;NASCAR 2005: Chase for the Cup&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "120610": {"poll": [], "name": "NASCAR 07", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American PlayStation 2 edition", "North American PSP edition", "North American Xbox edition", "UK PS2 Release"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["NASCAR"], "videogametheme": ["Driving"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["EA Tiburon", "Electronic Arts (EA)", "Exient Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["Racing"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2", "PSP", "Xbox"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["EA Sports"], "description": "NASCAR 07 is the tenth installment of the EA Sports' NASCAR video game series.

This is also the third EA Sports NASCAR video game to appear on a handheld system for Mobile phone version.<br/><br/>In October 2007, Electronic Arts moved the PlayStation 2 game development to a new studio in North Carolina to be able to get better information with the NASCAR teams in an attempt to improve the game. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game were still made at the old studio.

One new feature in NASCAR 09 is &quot;Own The Track&quot;. This allows the player to compete against friends or other gamers and own all 22 tracks in the Sprint Cup Series. Also new is the new &quot;Sprint Driver Challenge&quot;, in which the player complete challenges in all sorts of situations to earn rep and performance points. In the game there are two driving styles available for the player to choose from: Normal and Pro. The Pro driving style is more suited for experienced players, while the Normal mode is better suited for beginners.<br/><br/>To date, this is the last NASCAR game to be produced by EA, and the last NASCAR game for the PlayStation 2, after suffering from slumping sales, the difficulty of installing new features, and the lack of popularity. In 2009, NASCAR Kart Racing was released, replacing any 2009 installment for the annual series. It may be EA's last game before their exclusive license with NASCAR expires.

It has been designed to give the player ultimate flexibility in building and playing his or her character; however, we hope that each player will be more focused on having fun and on role-playing well than on character advancement. For the enjoyment of all the players of Magestry, we are interested in the personalities, backgrounds, and ambitions of each character on Magesta.

Besides controlling the two playable characters across a single scenario, the player is able to recruit creatures known as Dream Eaters able to assist them in fights.<br/><br/>The two playable characters are Sora and Riku, control of whom rotates throughout the game through the use of a gameplay element called the &quot;Drop&quot; system. This system features a Drop Gauge which gradually depletes on its own over time, automatically switching control between Sora and Riku once it empties. The player is able to keep the gauge from emptying by attacking enemies, and can switch characters at will using save points. An item called &quot;Drop-me-not&quot; can be used to replenish it as well. The amount of time the gauge can be leveled up if the player uses &quot;Drop Points&quot; when switching between characters.<br/><br/>The game sees the return of the &quot;Command Deck&quot; system which was introduced in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep and re-utilized in Re:coded. One of the key elements of the game is the &quot;flowmotion&quot; mechanic, allowing the player to utilize the surroundings for movement actions, and attacking with the execution of the Y button. When the player is using flowmotion, Sora or Riku will be covered in a violet aura, signifying its use. The game's most significant feature is the ability to hunt and collect Dream Eaters, with each individual Dream Eater companion providing Sora and Riku access to varying abilities, attacks, and cooperative actions. Many elements of the game utilize the touch screen, such as throwing enemies or chaining various attacks. The game also has interactive cut-scenes and events. Unlike previous games which used the Gummi Ship as a means of travelling to other worlds, this game makes use of a new mini-game called Dive Mode.

Players would begin play by creating a character, and outside of character creation, game play took place in a screen that displayed text interactions, the names and current status of one's party of characters, and a window which displayed images of geography, marked with large or small pictures of characters or events. When combat occurred, gameplay switched to a full-screen combat mode, in which player characters and enemies were represented by icons which would move around in the course of battle.<br/><br/>Neverwinter Nights was a co-development of AOL, Stormfront Studios, SSI, and TSR (which was acquired by Wizards of the Coast in 1997).<br/> Neverwinter Nights was the first multiplayer[2] online role-playing game to display graphics.[3]<br/> Don Daglow and the Stormfront game design team began working with AOL on original online games in 1987, in both text-based and graphical formats. At the time AOL was a Commodore 64 only online service, known as Quantum Computer Services, with just a few thousand subscribers, and was called Quantum Link. Online graphics in the late 1980s were severely restricted by the need to support modem data transfer rates as slow as 300 bits per second (bit/s).<br/> In 1989 the Stormfront team started working with SSI on Dungeons &amp; Dragons games using the Gold Box engine that had debuted with Pool of Radiance in 1988. Within months they realized that it was technically feasible to combine the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Gold Box engine with the community-focused gameplay of online titles to create an online role-playing video game with graphics. Although the multiplayer graphical flight combat game Air Warrior (also from Kesmai) had been online since 1987, all prior online RPGs had been based on text.<br/> In a series of meetings in San Francisco and Las Vegas with AOL's Steve Case and Kathi McHugh, TSR's Jim Ward and SSI's Chuck Kroegel, Daglow and programmer Cathryn Mataga convinced the other three partners that the project was indeed possible. Case approved funding for NWN and work began, with the game going live 18 months later in March 1991.<br/> Daglow chose Neverwinter as the game's location because of its magical features (a river of warm water that flowed from a snowy forest into a northern sea), and its location near a wide variety of terrain types. The area also was close enough to the settings of the other Gold Box games to allow subplots to intertwine between the online and the disk-based titles.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Neverwinter Nights (MMORPG)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "120666": {"poll": [], "name": "Alien Invaders-Plus!", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Brazilian Edition", "Canadian Odyssey 2 edition", "North American Odyssey 2 edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2837288.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Aliens", "Science Fiction", "Space"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Magnavox Consumer Electronics Co"], "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Odyssey\u00b2"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Magnavox Consumer Electronics Co", "Philips Electronics"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2837288_t.jpg", "description": "From the box:<br/><br/>Starring the Merciless Monstroths!

This time they take the gaming action to the African Front, from the start of Operation Compass on 8 December 1940, through 1942 to the eviction of the Axis from Libya.<br/><br/>Building on the notion of a card assisted game and death-or-glory victory conditions, No Retreat: The North African Front offers a narrative game rich in the feel for the ebb-and-flow of the campaign, wrapped around an exciting maneuver and combat system that harkens back to the glory days of classic wargaming, but includes all the modern features and plenty of innovations. Unlike other North Africa wargames, there are 5 &quot;mini-maps&quot; located at the various termini of maneuver in the campaign, and where battles are waged as fascinating &quot;mini-games&quot; in their own right. Players try to sweep each map and force the action onto the next one in an effort to push their opponent out of the game.<br/><br/>This Deluxe Edition combines both the original game, featuring Five quick-playing scenarios, a Tournament Game, a Full-Fledged Campaign game, and a Bonus &quot;Invasion of Crete&quot; mini-game, all using deluxe components of &quot;Twillight Struggle Deluxe Edition&quot; quality.<br/><br/>The looming Malta factor is accounted for most assiduously. While abstracted into many aspects of the game, players must always be mindful of Malta being made active (helping the Allies) or inactive (assisting the Axis). The Italian forces have their rightful place in the story unfolding on the game board, and the remarkable paucity of units turns every counter and hex into the kind of wargaming puzzle reminiscent of the glory days of those great contests from the Avalon Hill General magazine.<br/><br/>The use of Supply Point markers, received in a fast, hassle-free way, to seize the initiative, replace losses and recover shattered formations, to light up a map and begin operations there (i.e., conduct player turns on it of maneuver and combat), and then to continue those player turns for another round. Each additional round of player turns must be paid for by another Supply Point, usually spent by the side that feels it is advantageous to press on and keep the opponent hard pressed, recreating simply and effectively the lulls and starts in battlefield operations that were a signature of this campaign.<br/><br/>The desert lies before you and World War II is at stake. You must endure and prevail under the most surprising and grueling of circumstances, for there is No Retreat!<br/><br/>Bonus Game<br/><br/>No Retreat: The Invasion of Crete<br/>This Bonus mini-game will allow you to refight the first airborne invasion in history, during May 1941. Each player will fight to gain or maintain control of the Island's critical 3 airfields. Time is of the essence here as each contestant has to manage his limited ressources in a life-or-death contest where neither has space to Retreat! This is a very intense knife-fight that can be very well be decided in the few first days, while the German Airborne force is most vulnerable, or could turn into a desperate rear-guard action, as the hard-pressed Allied troops try to escape the island. An innovative pre-game set-up planning procedure, and Airborne Landing rules, will insure that no two games play the same.<br/><br/>Scenario Listing:<br/><br/><br/>     Operation Compass, 1940: The British surprise offensive against the unprepared Italians in Lybia, pushing them back over 300 miles and capturing 115,000 prisoners!  This scenario makes an excellent tutorial due to its low unit density. It is essentially a race game, with the Allies rushing to reach Map 2 and win the game there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Operation Sunflower, 1941: Rommel arrives in Africa with the 21st Panzer Division and begins operations to roll back the recent Allied advances, thanks to the withdrawal of their best troops to fight in Greece. Can you capture the important Port/Fortress of Tobruk, or will you to be stopped by the tenacious Australians?<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Operation Crusader, 1941: The importance of Tobruk and pressure from Malta on the Axis convoy routes to Africa caused both sides to fully commit to winning the war in the western desert during the British all-out attack to relieve the siege of the embattled Fortress. It's a wild free-for all battle, where speed of manoeuvre is all-important.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Operation Venezia, 1942: After capturing Tobruk in this operation and routing the Allied forces in the desert (and the cancellation of the Malta Invasion), the German High Command sends resources to help Rommel&rsquo;s exhausted forces race to Egypt. Can the forces of the Commonwealth hold the line at El-Alamein, or will the Afrika Corps reach Alexandria and the Suez Canal?<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Operation Lightfoot 1942: The last-ditch defence of Egypt and the resulting stalemate at El Alamein was finally turned to victory for the Allies as Monty&rsquo;s overwhelming force pushed back the depleted and badly-supplied Axis Divisions. Or maybe Rommel will be able again to outmanoeuvre the British foe, and turn this battle of attrition into another of his famous victories? <br/><br/><br/><br/>     A Tournament Scenario 1941: For players that have time to play more than a scenario, but not enough for the full-fledged campaign game.  Action starts with the first Rommel Attack of Operation Sunflower, and continues until Operation Crusader the end of 1941. Can the British keep Tobruk and Beghazi, or will the scenario end in an historical stalemate around Gazala? <br/><br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>     One 22x18 Mapboard &amp; two 11x18 Mapboards (all mounted and two-sided)<br/>     One sheet of 88, 2-sided square units - One sheet of 56, 2-sided round markers.<br/>     One rule book (24 pages)<br/>     One Scenario Book (24 pages)<br/>     55 Event Cards (36 for NR2!, 19 for Crete)<br/>     Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Number of Players: 2<br/>Ages: 14 and up<br/>Playing Time: approximately 50 minutes for each scenario; 4 to 5 hours for a campaign game; 60 to 90 minutes tor the Crete mini-game.<br/>Scale NR2: German &amp; Allied units are Divisions (8-10,000 men), Italian units are Corps of binary (2 Regiment) Divisions; each hex is 15km across, and each turn is 1-2 months of real time (sometimes split into tactical turns of 3-4 days) .<br/>Scale Crete: Units are Multi-Battalion size battlegroups; each hex is 3km across, and each turn is 8-12 hours.<br/><br/>DESIGNER: Carl Paradis<br/>DEVELOPER: Alan Emrich<br/>COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch &amp; Charles Kibler<br/>MAP ART: Charles Kibler<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["GMT Deluxe edition"], "average": "7.46721", "name": "No Retreat!

Originally written for the TRS-80 Model II, the program was later converted to the IBM PC. The code, by Eugene Szymanski, was published by Byte magazine in 1982.<br/><br/>JETSET simulates instrument flight in a Boeing 747 using ASCII graphics. The program does not provide a view out of the cockpit, other than displaying the runway for takeoff and landing. The physics engine was noteworthy for the time, particularly considering the simulator was written entirely in BASIC.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Jetset (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>Excerpts from Documentation<br/><br/>747, or JETSET as it was named by the author, offers the adventure of piloting a jet aircraft minus the jet lag and the risk. The program name JETSET is an acronym for the Jet Simulator  Electronic Trainer. You will maneuver an aircraft through the three stages of flight--takeoff, cruising, and landing--in less than ideal conditions.<br/><br/>The program . . . uses the keyboard and screen to make a personal computer version of a commercial flight simulator. To make JETSET a realistic simulation, everything the pilot does in this program must be coordinated with an instrument panel displayed on the computer screen. In addition, the pilot must follow the actual procedures required when flying in near-zero visibility. A plane flown in such inclement weather must proceed according to Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) established by the government, and the pilot must be specially trained and certified to fly ON INSTRUMENTS. This information is incorporated into the JETSET program.<br/><br/>The JETSET (747) Program lets the pilot activate the control surfaces of the jet aircraft, adjust engine thrust, and tune navigational radio equipment by pressing a set of keys. The program responds to the keypress commands by adjusting aircraft attitude to match the control surfaces and updating the instrument panel display every four seconds as the trajectory of the jetliner is tracked through space by the computer.<br/><br/>When the simulation begins, the jetliner is poised for takeoff on the runway at Philadelphia International Airport. The geographic coordinates of Philadelphia mark the starting point of flight. The computer fixes this initial position in memory and cranks out a new longitude and latitude 15 times a minute. The pilot controls the path of the jet during the takeoff roll down the runway. If everything is done correctly in the cockpit, this path will lead to a takeoff with room to spare.<br/><br/>Because JETSET knows precisely where the pilot is telling the plane to go, the program will continue to run until the jet lands safely and rolls to a halt or until the flight ends in disaster. When the simulation has ended, for whatever reason, JETSET provides a complete report of the pilot's performance. The report includes the landing location of the plane-whether on or off the runway-to the nearest foot, and in case of pilot error a description of the error and the likely damage to the aircraft.<br/><br/>"}, "120680": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Kuro"], "average": "5.66667", "poll": [], "name": "Radical School Hours", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Deck / Pool Building", "Press Your Luck"], "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1246586_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Fuji", "Kinuya Ryoichi", "Soga", "Spring", "Arai Teruko", "Fujii Tsumugi"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Manifest Destiny"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1246586.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Manifest Destiny Game market edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "User summary<br/><br/>A home-made Japanese card game, based on the so-called &quot;dating simulators&quot;.

The phrase has no single origin; it might refer to the rose as a symbol of silence and the Greek god Harpocrates, as well as a symbol of secrecy originating from a story of Aphrodite giving a rose to Harpocrates to ensure that her indiscretions remained silent and secret. In ancient Rome, roses were painted or carved in the ceilings of banquet rooms, ensuring that things said under the influence of wine would remain under the rose. In Christian confessionals, the phrase and the symbol of a five-petalled rose are sometimes invoked to reinforce silence and secrecy. Modern security services and agencies will use the term for covert operations, and the phrase even finds its home in meetings in parliaments that are held &ldquo;off the record&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Sub Rosa is also a game, but it&rsquo;s not solely about secrecy. A key element of the Sub Rosa game is conspiracy, downfall, secrets and lies and the dangers inherent in all of them. It&rsquo;s a game that takes place in a dark city, where players take on the role of Inquisitors of the Sub Rosa Society, a secret society within a larger church which has taken on a mandate of guarding the city from corruption, collapse, chaos and heresy. Their work is paramount, secret, and rife with conspiracy and the ever-present threat of the evil within. The Inquisitors are sanctified; all they do in the name of their society is forgiven and allowed. Can anyone&rsquo;s conscience survive doing evil to prevent it? Will they find that the collapse of society is simply a mirror of what&rsquo;s happening within them?<br/><br/>One player takes on the role of the Lord Inquisitor, the high master of the society. He&rsquo;s an enigmatic, cruel and bird-like figure who seemingly delights in watching his underlings suffer for his causes, personal or otherwise. He often instructs the cell (a collective term for the inquisitors) to perform certain tasks or investigations on his behalf. The player of the Lord Inquisitor is therefore not just responsible for this one character, but also for every investigation the Inquisitors take on. That means giving the players the leads they&rsquo;ll need to progress, tracking their blessings, playing any characters they interact with and so on. At the end of every game, the cell will report their version of what they did to the Lord Inquisitor, who -of course- already knows everything that occurred during the mission thanks to his hidden eyes and ears and will judge them based on their success&hellip; or failure.<br/><br/>"}, "120706": {"poll": [], "name": "Mushroom War", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iPhone edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Cute Fantasy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["WestRiver"], "videogamegenre": ["Tower Defense"], "videogameplatform": ["iPhone"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["WestRiver"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>&quot;Mushroom wars is a cute cartoonish tower defense game.

Summon the best team of undead fighters and in six turns you&rsquo;ll be named Super Grand Master, a highly coveted and extremely descriptive title.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each necromancer is given a hand containing nine cards. They represent an eccentric collection of skeletons, zombies, vampires, ghouls, and other spooks. Each turn, you select one of these weird characters and send it to the field. Once your opponent has done the same, the fun begins! All the fighters pair off and fight to the death. Normally, this sort of thing would be dangerous, but undead are durable and really get into the spirit of the thing.<br/><br/>Winners score points while losers are flipped face down. Undead are resilient, so losing fighters will reassemble themselves in time for next turn&rsquo;s battle. But if you don&rsquo;t think your losing fighter will do better next turn, you can pull him out of line and turn him into a spirit. Spirits are the ultimate fans, boosting the power of all of your fighters. Some spirits even let you replace weaker fighters!<br/><br/>Strategy in Day of the Dead centers around positioning; when played in the right place, any fighter can be a champion. On the other hand, even your favorite fighter can be a total failure if you are too stubborn to pull him out of a losing matchup. Stay flexible and you will bury your competition.<br/><br/>Turn Order<br/><br/>     Summoning &mdash; When you bring new cards to the field.<br/>         A New Slot Opens &mdash; Each turn a new slot opens up on the field for both players. On the first turn, each player takes a card from their hand and places it as a fallen fighter in this new slot. On each turn after that, they will take their current spirit card and place it there.<br/>         Play a New Card &mdash; Fighters start their undeath as spirits, face down and slightly below the field. Spirits are also rotated 90 degrees to show that they are special. When considering what card to play, remember that you can only have 2 cards of each back in play. On turn 6, the final turn, you are allowed to break this rule and choose whatever card back you want.<br/>         The Field Becomes Active &mdash; Flip all cards on the field face up (except for your spirit, it&rsquo;s not on the field though it&rsquo;s watching with considerable interest). If any player chose an Unearth card to be their spirit, they resolve this effect now. Then you&rsquo;re ready to fight!<br/>    <br/>     Fighting &mdash; When your fighters get to work.  Fights resolve one by one, starting with the newest slot and going to the oldest. Fights are 1 on 1 affairs and follow rigid rules. Be aware of what spirits each player has, as they will affect the outcome of each fight.<br/>         Use Effects &mdash; Starting with the player who has the Priority counter, both fighters use their effects. Fighters must use their effects if able.If a player has a Double card as their spirit, they use their fighter&rsquo;s effect, then immediately use it again.<br/>         Add Up the Power &mdash; Add on the printed power of each fighter to any bonuses they may have accumulated via effects or spirits (Remember, if a player has a Power Up card as their spirit, they will get +2 power this fight).<br/>         Compare Power &mdash; The higher-powered fighter is declared winner (in the event of a tie, both fighters are considered winners) and stays active. The lower-powered fighter is declared the loser and flips face down, becoming fallen.<br/>         The Loser May Become a Spirit  &mdash; If your fighter lost its fight this turn and you want to try something new, you can pull it from line and turn it into a spirit.<br/>         Move on to the Next Fight <br/>    <br/>     Rewards &mdash; When you gain victory points.<br/>         Score Victory Points &mdash; Each player scores victory points equal to the printed power values on their active fighters. Fallen cards score no points. Use the score board to keep track of it all.<br/>         Pass Priority &mdash; The player who currently has the priority counter passes it to the other player. Next turn, that player will be able to use their effects first. This turn is now over!<br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Winning<br/><br/>     At the end of 6 turns, a winner is declared.

Every profession has up to 4 abilities, banning other professions from the game, adding a bonus for bidding on a specific building and providing extra income if some specific building/profession card is in the game.<br/><br/>There are 12 Character cards from which the players can choose, each with a special ability, adding to the game diversity.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as the town includes four or more of the buildings listed on a player's objective card, that player being the winner of the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "4", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "5.99231", "name": "Wild Fun West", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding"], "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": ["Wild Fun West: Chieftain promo card", "Wild Fun West: Golden Age", "Wild Fun West: Rustler promo card"], "usersrated": "104", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Indiegogo"]}, "120782": {"rpgdesigner": ["Elsa Franke"], "rpgitemversion": ["First German Printing", "Gratis Rollenspieltag 2013 Version", "PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Midgard f\u00fcr Einsteiger", "rpgartist": ["Thorsten Kettermann", "Ulf Lehmann", "Hartwig Nieder-Gassel", "Werner \u00d6ckl"], "rpgproducer": ["Elsa Franke"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1294480.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "rpgsetting": ["Midgard-Multiversum"], "average": "6", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Verlag f\u00fcr Fantasy- und Science Fiction-Spiele"], "rpg": ["Midgard (4th Edition)"], "rpgcategory": ["Quick Start / Fast Play Rules"], "rpgseries": ["Gratisrollenspieltag 2013", "Gratisrollenspieltag 2015"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1294480_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>User Summary:<br/><br/>This small booklet contains an introduction into the Midgard rules.

The game features characters from several titles published by SNK and ADK.<br/><br/>Plot Line:  In February, 2017 of the new Japanese era there is a man trying to rule the NEOGEO World. &quot;I will topple NeoGeo's most powerful warriors and put myself on the throne!&quot;. We knew that if he managed to obtain NeoGeo world's awesome power, world domination would not be far from his reach. This man, who sat at the heart of the &quot;WAREZ Conglomerate&quot; with overwhelming financial power behind him, had already set out on his ambitious path to gain NeoGeo World's power. Those who knew the truth of his intentions were already trembling with fear... As NeoGeo World drew closer to the verge of disaster, a WAREZ sponsored fighting competition was announced. This event is called &quot;NEOGEO BATTLE COLISEUM&quot;. The Federal Government is worried about the situation, and has secretly dispatched its two best secret agents, Yuki and Ai. A world on the verge of eternal darkness... The future of NEOGEO World is now in the hands of the warriors.&quot;<br/><br/>The game system of the arcade NGBC, as previously mentioned, is a 2 vs. 2 tag battle, regardless of how many players are playing. While the 2-player game system is similar to most tag-team systems of other games, the single player system is unusual.<br/><br/>The game's single play is more like a survival battle, where the player must beat enemies after enemies as long as possible. However, the game gives the player 300 seconds, and when time-out occurs, instead of win or lose, the player will face the boss (depending on how well they perform). Only at this point of time is when time out will determine the victor.<br/><br/>During a single-play, the rule is to defeat any member of the team, not both team members. That is, unlike most tag-team systems (but similar to Kizuna Encounter or Tekken Tag Tournament), where all opposition must be beaten in order to win, in NGBC the player only needs to beat up one member of the opposite team to win, without the need to fight the other member if the former is defeated.<br/><br/>The survival battles are divided into rounds of 3 battles, and after a player manages to clear 3 opponent teams, they are given a chance to use one of the three game services provided:<br/><br/>The first is to gain more time. Extra time helps the player to beat more teams, which is so because the game records the number of teams defeated in the hi-score table.<br/>    The second is to gain full power gauge. This is simply to blow the opposition away as soon as the next battle starts.<br/>    The third is adding more life. Self-explanatory, especially due to the winning condition mentioned earlier.<br/><br/>Additionally, if the player loses and chooses to continue, they're given the option to use one of three continue services to help give them a boost getting back into the game:<br/><br/>The first takes your opponent's life gauge down to 1/4 full.<br/>    The second fully maxes out the player's special move gauge.<br/>    The third adds more time.<br/><br/>Double Assault<br/><br/>Also abbreviated as D-Assault, it's one of the new super moves in this game, when the character makes a rush attack that, if connected successfully, calls the partner to perform together a special tag team autocombo, similar to games like Marvel vs Capcom or Tekken Tag Tournament. In addition to that, certain characters have special D-Assaults. Here are some of the possible combinations:<br/><br/>Yuki and Ai have 2 different D-Assaults, depending of the leader character. If the leader is Yuki, he calls Ai and they combine their powers and transform into Atomic Guy (one of the monsters from King of the Monsters) for a few seconds, and all his attacks are unblockable.<br/>    In the case of Ai, she calls Yuki and both create a super attack which shocks all opponents on-screen. The name of this move is ASO II: Last Guardian.<br/>    Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami make the technique they both used in KOF 97 to defeat Orochi. In this attack, Iori grabs his opponent by the neck while Kyo charges a devastating blow.<br/>    Terry Bogard and Rock Howard share special D-Assault attacks, rightly named &quot;Storm and Stream&quot; and &quot;Buster and Storm&quot;. It's a combination of their famous supers with variations depending of the leader character; either being a Shining Knuckle/Power Stream combo or a Buster Wolf/Raging Storm combo.<br/>    Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia both attack with their signature Zan Retsu Ken/Genn'ei Kyaku moves and later make a backjump finishing with a double Haohshokoken, while the background goes black and a dragon and a tiger (that represent Ryo and Robert, respectively) appear on the screen.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Neo Geo Battle Coliseum&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "120803": {"rpgdesigner": ["Joshua L.

To combat this threat, Mr. Reagan has created an elite anti-terrorist force, the Justified Intelligence Network of Gifted Operatives. That's right, J.I.N.G.O.! When extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary operatives, J.I.N.G.O. is there to protect the U. S. of A. from terrorists, communists, or whatever else threatens this great land of ours.<br/><br/>Recreate the thrills of your favorite toy-based cartoons from the 80's with J.I.N.G.O. - America's Greatest Combat Squad!

It and Rayman Raving Rabbids for the Nintendo DS are the only 2.5D platformers in the Rayman series.<br/><br/>This game is the first Rayman game to use an isometric (2.5D) view. Most of the levels put the player in control of Rayman, while other levels put the player in control of his partner, Globox. In certain levels, the player is able to control both of them in the same level by pressing the Select button to switch the characters. The goal of each level is to get to the end and gain the maximum amount of points possible. To do this, the player has to collect gems and lums that are scattered throughout the levels. Also, freeing Teensies and defeating enemies gives the player points. At the end of the level, the player earns Murfy stamps, based on their score. Murfy stamps are not important to the completion of the game, but after getting a certain number of them, extra levels are unlocked. There is a total of five levels that can be unlocked with the acquiring of Murfy stamps.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Rayman: Hoodlums' Revenge&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "120830": {"poll": [], "name": "Gundam SEED: Battle Assault", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Game Boy Advance edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Natsume"], "videogamefranchise": ["Gundam"], "videogameplatform": ["Game Boy Advance"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Bandai (\u30d0\u30f3\u30c0\u30a4)"], "description": "In 2004 Gundam SEED: Battle Assault was released for the Game Boy Advance and featured units exclusively form the recent Mobile Suit Gundam SEED anime.
