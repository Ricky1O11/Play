Units are issued order chits (or blanks to confuse the opponent) at the beginning of the turn sequence, which commits units to specific actions for that turn. Orders are revealed simultaneously. The rules cover charges, movement, missile fire, and melee. Both missile and melee combat use damage tables with modifiers to determine casualties, which are converted into a percentage. Percentage dice (2 x D10's) are used to determine if a percentage fraction &quot;hits&quot; or not.<br/><br/>Although the rules use a casualty removal system, the most a side can lose is 3 figures per missile or melee round. Morale has a strong influence in the game, and the side that can force more morale tests upon his opponent will often win the game.<br/><br/>The rules come with  a sheet of order chits/status markers, which can either be cut out or photocopied (using different colored paper can help to further distinguish the orders or unit status at a glance).

Your deck represents your Juggernaut.  Your opponent also has a Juggernaut. Your goal is to incapacitate your opponent&rsquo;s Juggernaut so your ground forces can infiltrate and overwhelm it before he or she can do the same to you.<br/><br/>Before the game starts, you need to download and print out Juggernauts cards and build your deck.  Cards fall into general categories of power generators, attacks, defenses, and miscellaneous effects.<br/><br/>At the start of a game:<br/><br/>     Pick a standard polyhedral die to be your Juggernaut's Commander.<br/>     Draw cards equal to the number of sides on your Commander, plus three.<br/>     Lay out all but three of the cards in your hand face-down so that each card:<br/>         occupies one square in an imaginary grid, and<br/>         is adjacent to at least one card.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This matrix of cards is your Juggernaut.  Face-down cards are inactive nodes and face-up cards are active nodes.<br/><br/>Play during a game is simultaneous; you and your opponent go through the same phases in a turn at the same time.  You  start your turn by gaining 1 power (plus any additional from active cards in your Juggernaut).  You use power to:<br/><br/>     Activate cards that require Power,<br/>     Increase the effectiveness of an attack or defense,<br/>     Maintain cards you want to keep<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>After you gain power, you roll your Commander to see which card in your Juggernaut's matrix activates.  If you do not have an active card by the end of your command phase (this can happen if your Commander tries to activate a damaged sector, a neutralized card, or a card token), put an alert token on your deck. This means that your enemy&rsquo;s ground forces are approaching. Remove all alert tokens when you activate a damaged sector. If you have three or more alert tokens on your deck at the end of a round, enemy troops have infiltrated your juggernaut and taken control. You lose and your opponent wins.<br/><br/>Next, you and your opponent reveal your active cards and resolve them.  Once cards resolve, you discard them, draw cards to replace them, then play cards from your hand to fill in the ones that you discarded.<br/><br/>The mechanics are such that large Juggernauts with many-sided Commanders (d 12, d 20) have lots of &quot;hit points&quot;, but are easy to hit with attacks, difficult to get reliable results from, and vulnerable to accumulating alert tokens.  Small Juggernauts with few-sided Commanders (d4, d6) are difficult to hit and produce very predictable results, but have very few &quot;hit points&quot;.<br/><br/>Juggernauts is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5 License.

While the first pack contained new fighters, this one adds more Light Bombers and Formation aircraft to the  system.<br/><br/>The pack will include such famous aircraft as the B-25H (complete with 75mm gun) and the Il-2m3 Shturmovik. But there will be lesser-known planes as well, like the German Hs-129B-1/R2 (a sort of WWII version of today's A-10) and the Italian CANT Z.501 Gabbiano flying boat. All the cards will be printed in the eight-per-sheet (cut 'em out yourself) style of C3i-DiF module inserts that you've enjoyed over the years.<br/><br/>One of the difficulties in creating a pack of bombers and patrol planes is that up until now these aircraft types have only been used in the context of a Down in Flames campaign. The rules included in the pack provide three ways around this problem. First, there are guidelines for adding Formation aircraft to basic game dogfights. Second, the pack includes a number of stand-alone generic missions into which players can simply &quot;plug in&quot; appropriate aircraft. Finally, we have included rules (courtesy of Roger Horky) that allow Formation aircraft to engage in a form of dogfighting (called Gunnery Duels in the game) with other Formation planes. So if you've ever wanted to fly a Short Stirling against an FW-200 Condor, now is your chance.<br/><br/>Squadron Pack 2's rules also contain reprints of some of the rules from Corsairs and Hellcats for the benefit of those players who don't own that game (you know who you are). In addition, there are rules for two new ground attack weapons: the German Hs 293 radio-controlled air to surface missile and Fritz X radio-controlled glide bomb.<br/><br/>Like the first pack, Squadron Pack 2: Bombers will contain 64 new aircraft cards printed 8 to a sheet in the same enhanced graphic style as Squadron Pack 1. The pack will also include a short (4-8 page) rulebook and an 11x17 wrap around cover decorated with Rodger MacGowan's gorgeous artwork. The inside of the cover sheet will form a play mat for use during Gunnery Duels.<br/><br/>Developers: Mike Lemick and Rodger B.

The game continues with subsequent deals until one player's total score reaches at least 100.

Militarily, it had totally failed in the assigned objectives. For the August offensive, the NVA concentrated two divisions, the 5th and 9th. The 5th had grown to 15,000 men and elements of the plan called for the capture of American M113 APCs from the 10l ARVN squadron to infiltrate into the US headquarters for it's destruction. The plan also called for the divisions to be used piecemeal with the objective of killing Americans and occupying Tay Ninh City. Such an event would reap a political bonanza equal to the Tet Offensive. It was thought this would decimate US morale because War Zone C was well occupied by American troops. More important to the NVA plan was the hope that the awesome American airpower would be neutralized by the August monsoons.

Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture.

In the Finnish version you use sticks to hit the big stone instead of using your finger which makes Korona even more similar to billiards than the Carrom.<br/><br/>The pockets are typically larger than in Carrom but there's some space between the pockets and the edge of the board. Therefore it's possible for a piece to go behind the pocket which can sometimes cause some extra trouble.<br/><br/>During a setup the pieces of each player are placed in a tight row against the wall on the opposing side of the board instead of a pattern in the center. There's no bonus pieces in this game. Because all the pieces are separated according to their color, it's possible for a skillful player to put all the pieces in a pocket with only one strike.<br/><br/>Each player in a three or four player game may play with their own colors instead of forming teams with opposing players.<br/><br/>The Swedish Couronne is similar in that it typically has space behind the pockets and uses cues, but the pieces (usually 15 of each colour) are initially placed in the middle.

While it is designed in Australia, and uses a few Australian expressions, the content and theme are not noticeably Australian.<br/><br/>The playing area is a simulation of a planned city, divided into two zones : an inner Residential ring and an outer Industrial ring. The play proceeds on a circular track, with each ring containing a series of &ldquo;sites&rdquo;, of which two aggregate to a &ldquo;subdivision&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The ultimate objective is to &ldquo;evenly develop&rdquo; as many of these sites as possible, without going broke !<br/><br/>The Residential zone can be developed by building Cottages, Mansions, and Flats(apartments), while the Industrial zone is available for a variety of uses, represented by card &ldquo;shares&rdquo;( stocks). It is NOT necessary to land on a particular site to purchase it.<br/><br/>Players alternate between each ring according to dice throws, and pay penalties for landing on other Players&rsquo; sites. Several spaces mandate change of zone. Movement is subject to considerable randomization.<br/><br/>Each player receives an initial land allocation of two &ldquo;subdivisions&rsquo; (two sites each of Residential and Industrial) ; plus a cash &ldquo;float&rdquo;. Players proceed to buy development items, initially from the bank. The pool of available items is limited, to induce competition.<br/><br/>The inventory comprises: Cottages 14, Mansions 10, Flats 6 ( total 30). The space available to place these items totals 24. Prices range from a low of $100 for &ldquo;Cottages&rdquo; to $400 for a &ldquo;share&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Electronics&rdquo; factory. More expensive items eventually provide a disproportionately higher return, but may be too expensive in the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>Players are able to increase the value of their holdings by increasing the capital investment on each site from a single unit up to two units and/or more valuable buildings and upgraded shares. Any site must contain only identical items, but any subdivision may contain a mix ( eg cottages and mansions on adjacent sites; or, say, &ldquo;railway&rdquo; shares next to &ldquo;glass works&rdquo;).Various bonuses accrue when sites are &ldquo;double developed&rdquo; and/or when sites are &ldquo;evenly developed&rdquo;.<br/><br/>These development items are available initially from a bank, but soon become tradeable between Players. Players short of cash for Landing fees may even have to trade/sell at &ldquo;distress&rdquo; prices.<br/><br/>When all a Player&rsquo;s sites are &ldquo;evenly developed&rdquo;, Players can attempt to buy more <br/>(vacant) land, from the bank only.<br/><br/>The game has several unusual features:<br/>1. &ldquo;stock&rsquo; ( houses, shares etc) can be moved from one site to another, or even &ldquo;off board&rdquo; until required again.<br/>2. un-developed sites attract no landing fees (unlike Monopoly)<br/>3. there is some limited scope for trading of rationed items above their &ldquo;bank price&rdquo;, as Players seek to establish &ldquo;double developed&rdquo; sites<br/>4.

The game proceeds simultaneously over three different periods. You start the game in the Middle Ages, on the first of the three game boards (that of the commanderies). With 4 action cards in hand per turn, you have seven turns in which to develop your domains by building various types of military, religious, and civil buildings. Depending on their size, certain buildings are moved in time, which means that they are transferred to the same place on the priories board (Renaissance period) and on the brotherhoods board (modern period), in ruins for military and religious buildings (castles, abbeys&hellip;).<br/><br/>Thanks to the watch makers' invention, and with enough money, you can make your two adventurer pawns travel in time&hellip; Because if the construction of certain buildings can be profitable, taking over domains on the various boards is essential, since it will allow you to earn bonuses on the 4th and 7th turns and to move ahead of your opponents.<br/><br/>Playing with time is not without consequences, and it can produce surprising results! To give just one example, an abbey created on the priories board could be destroyed by a castle built later in the game in the same place but on the commanderies board, and then moved to the other board&hellip; The abbey finally never existed!<br/><br/>On the 4th and 7th turns, each controlled domain generates profits for the players depending on the board. On the the commanderies board, a player who controls a domain militarily, i.e. the one with the biggest military building, will receive the value of the civil buildings in this domain in profits. On the priories board, it is the religious control that will be taken into account. On the brotherhoods board, the players who have best populated the civil buildings and restored the ruins will secure the best profits.<br/><br/>The possibility of destroying and regrouping buildings to unite or divide domains provides a strong and permanent level of interaction between the players.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Edge edition", "German edition", "Matagot Editions", "Matagot first edition", "Rio Grande Games Edition"], "average": "6.38914", "name": "Khronos", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Hand Management", "Tile Placement"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "1598", "boardgameaccessory": ["Khronos: Figurines and Linen Cards"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Steampunk", "Time Travel"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 22 \u2013 Khronos", "The Spiel #122 - Eric Clapton's Underwear"]}, "25675": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Fran\u00e7ois Treca"], "average": "5", "poll": [], "name": "N\u00e9goces", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "5", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic149074_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Cyrille Bertin"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Negoces"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic149074.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Negotiate with the other players the purchase and the sale of goods and become the Great Negotiator.

Each player in turn answers general knowledge questions about horses, and can play a card to accelerate a horse, until two horses have crosses the finishing line.<br/>The wide variety of cards and the color and position of the horses give the players unlimited scope for tactics and last-minute gallops to the finishing post !<br/>The appeal of EQUID is that the game is a mixture of bluff, astute card playing, tactics and general knowledge, without forgetting an element of chance to spice up the game and create an enjoyable atmosphere and some unforgettable moments !<br/>The game covers every aspect of a horse and its universe, with over 1100 questions about ethology, anatomy, racing, techniques, equipment, health, feeding, sporting events... to test your knowledge and bring you a wealth of interesting facts and amusing anecdotes !<br/><br/>"}, "25738": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic392560.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Brian Hersch"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2006", "maxplayers": "0", "age": "12", "boardgamepublisher": ["Hasbro", "Hersch and Company", "Parker Brothers", "Winning Moves Games (USA)"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic392560_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Memory", "Party Game", "Word Game"], "description": "&quot;Get ready to play The Big Taboo...<br/><br/>The Big Taboo is one mix between from the traditional Taboo, Taboo Body Talk and Taboo Quick Draw.

By placing gems, players put in place the components that will make them able to produce one of many different magic components. Those components will be used as reagents in the cure.<br/><br/>When playing, a player merely chooses an action among three :<br/><br/>     draw a new card<br/>     add a gem to the pattern, trying to put a reagent in play<br/>     move a gem on the pattern to another place, thus producing an 'alchemy reaction'.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The players use alchemy powers to prevent the opposing team from putting their reagents in play, or to speed up their own production, in order to produce the best cure for the king and be rewarded accordingly. The game ends as soon as one category of gems is depleted, so it is important to delay the end of the game if your team hasn't found the best cure yet.<br/><br/>The other side of the board presents a completely different game named the &quot;Epic Version&quot;, that includes more diplomacy and roleplaying features.<br/><br/>Players are powerful mages trying to save the city of Astoria from three disasters : a barbarian invasion, a revolt, and the wrath of a powerful dragon. They develop their powers by creating magic items and putting them in play. Magic items are from six different magic sources, and each source can be used for a different effect on the city. The players use those magical forces to fight off the barbarians and defend the city from the besieging forces. The barbarian hordes will also be reinforced by war chiefs and sorcerers that will add to the pressure on the city.<br/><br/>The players objective is still to find a cure to the illness of the king of Astoria. But some of the mages are also traitors, trying to lead the king to his final rest and give victory to one of the enemies of Astoria. Players have to watch each other, and may accuse another mage of treachery. They also have to keep an eye for the king's health, for if he dies, everything will be lost for the defenders.<br/><br/>The game has different endings : the king can die, or can be saved. Or the city may fall to the hands of one of the enemies of Astoria. If one of the enemy factions comes to its maximal force, the game immediately ends with the victory of this faction (and, possibly, the victory of the traitor that was secretly supporting it!).<br/><br/>Both the Combination and the Epic Versions use a scoring method that makes it possible for players to play the game in competition and tournaments.<br/><br/>"}, "25773": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic181973.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Dan Verssen"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2006", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": ["Martin Scott", "Dan Verssen"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Dan Verssen Games (DVG)"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic181973_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Aviation / Flight", "Card Game", "Print & Play", "Wargame", "World War I"], "description": "Down In Flames - WWI depicts the fun and flavor of World War I aerial dogfighting.

Each set of colored chips is segmented into 3 sets (10 each) of 1, 2, and 3-minute activities. Play starts when each player antes up a corresponding minute chip and 5 cards are dealt (a 1-minute ante must be matched by another 1-minute ante and so on). As play progresses, each player may elect to call, raise, or fold. Players bet by choosing among the chips that contain the activities that they would be willing to perform in the event they lose. At showdown, the player with the best poker hand will get to receive all of the chip activities that were bet from the other player. For example, if the guy wins the hand, the woman must now perform all of the activities contained on the pink chips that were bet into the pot. When you ante up, you are not deciding what you want done to you; you are choosing what you will do for your partner. This way, players own comfort level will dictate how 'hot' things get.

This is a<br/>game were everybody plays equally - not where one player controls the bad guys and everybody<br/>responds/submits to his decisions. Each player controls his own little band of misfits AND controls<br/>the critters that another player will encounter. Each player is someone else's nemesis.<br/>All encounter and miscellaneous event rolls are done in the open, and are a surprise for everybody<br/>to enjoy. The whole point of this little endeavor is for everybody to have fun, so it helps<br/>if you don't take things too seriously. These rules are not intended as an overly detailed, exhaustive<br/>study in the complexities of subterranean armored combat. Nor will they require you<br/>to undertake a prolonged course of study in order to properly equip and prepare your party for<br/>eventual world domination.<br/>&quot;Elegance in Simplicity&quot; is the rule, even when it comes to brawling in the dark recesses of the<br/>dungeons. Hopefully you will find DungeonCrawl to be reasonably quick and reasonably fun.<br/>Enjoy.<br/>All players will begin the game with essentially equal parties. In the standard game, parties are<br/>composed of 1 fighter, 1 archer, 1 cleric, 1 thief, and 1 mage. For more advanced games, players<br/>may customize their party to suit their playing style. All players have roughly the same goal<br/>&ndash; get their party out alive with as much loot as possible. In the basic game, the winner is determined<br/>by the player with the most loot at the end. More advanced games have differing goals,<br/>or specific objectives to be accomplished in order to claim victory.<br/>But it all boils down to:<br/>Kill Critters, Get Goodies; try to get out alive so you can brag about it.<br/><br/>"}, "25811": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Feeding Frenzy", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1998", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic518180_t.jpg", "average": "3.25", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Big Eye Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic518180.jpg", "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Card Game", "Children's Game", "Environmental"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Two games in one!<br/><br/>FEEDING FRENZY<br/><br/>Eat your way to the top in this fast, fun, frenzied game!

They will not be really safe until they reach their Pirate's Nest on Tortuga.<br/>Each player leads a group of pirates to Pirate's Nest on Tortuga.The path leads the pirates through wild jungle and across the waters of open ocean to the island of Tortuga. In addition to the innate perils of the trip are the other pirates, as each group wants to be the first to arrive at Pirate's Nest and will do what they can to slow the others' progress.

Your last move points to the mini grid in which your next move must be made.

Both can be played using the same components. Kariba, the main game, is a 2 player variant inspired by the Mancala game family. Kalak is a Marbles variant, or rather, a pebble-flicking dexterity game whose arena is created by assembling the 2 piece jigsaw board in an alternative way. Kalak is mainly aimed at younger players.<br/><br/>KARIBA<br/>This variation on the age-old Mancala game keeps the familiar sowing movement rules, but it introduces an alternative way to capture stones and dramatically changes the way the board is used. It also introduces new types of pebbles. They now come in 3 different colours, each with its own value, and one even with a special protective ability. The board shows 2 large scoring pits at either end of the board. Between them, 2 rows of just 4 pits are sitting side by side. Each player is assigned one row of 4 that ends in their private scoring pit. This row is the only row in which a player will place their own pieces and it should be obvious that the players move in opposite directions.<br/><br/>At the start, both players get a set of 25 stones that forms the supply, and these are kept beside the board. It is a mix of 3 types: 20 stones that are worth 1 point, 3 treasure stones that are worth 2, and 2 guard stones that are not only worth 3 points, but also protect all stones in a pit from capture, as long as a black stone is not caught out sitting on its own. By itself, a guard stone is equally vulnerable to capture.<br/><br/>In turn, players pick up 1-4 tones from supply and move them onto the board, or remove all stones from one of their own pits and move these further along the track towards the scoring pit. To move a hand of stones, the player chooses the first hand stone and drops it into the pit it would reach next on its way to the scoring pit. Then, 1 stone is dropped in each pit thereafter until a player's hand is empty. When a player manages to drop a stone into the scoring pit (here players are forced to drop the lowest value stone), it is safe and counts toward their end total. All remaining hand stones go back to supply and must start all over again. When one player has no more stones left to move, the game ends. Players add up the total points in their own pit. The loser ignores any stones left en-route on the board, but subtracts the value of the stones still in supply from this total. The player with the highest score wins, with simple tie-breakers provided.<br/><br/>What makes this game interesting is the way by which opposing pieces are captured. When a stone is placed in an empty hole, all opposition stones that sit beside it and are not protected by at least one guard stone are captured and are immediately added to the pit of the capturing player, boosting that player's score. The high stone total triggers the need for continued protection from capture by Guard Stones, which adds to the deliberations to be made. Guards stones will be deliberately played so they overshoot the scoring pit, ensuring their continued services as protectors of all other stones on their way to the scoring pit. However, sacrifices will have to be made, making continual forward planning a requirement for victory.<br/><br/>KALAK<br/>By flipping over one side of the jigsaw board, a flat surface is revealed for the bottom half of the board, and that leaves a square of 4 small pits with 1 large one directly above it at the top. The player sits at the base of the flat surface board, and makes a smiling pebble face by placing 2 black pupil stones in the lower &quot;eye socket&quot; pits, 2 blue ones underneath the nose-shaped jigsaw lock to make nostrils, and by creating a smiling mouth of the remaining 8 blue stones underneath.<br/><br/>In phase 1, the player flicks each blue stone once, trying to reach the large target pit at the top. Only blue stones that fall into this pit can be taken into the second phase, the rest are removed. In phase 2, the player places all surviving stones in a single row on the bottom edge, including the 2 eye stones if more than 4 stones survived the first phase. Again, stones are all flicked once, but this time the player determines their end score. Each pitted stone scored one point, but player's will have to spread the stones out across all pits, as any stones that supercede the maximum capacity set for each pit in this phase are worthless. Optional rules to make it harder by using special landing restrictions for the then also more valuable eye stones, or making it easier by relaxing the set-up for phase 2 are also included.<br/><br/>PUBLICATION HISTORY:<br/><br/>     2006 Kariba (including Kalak) Clemens Gerhards - deluxe wooden version - in print (last checked oct 2006)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Clemens Gerhards produces their wooden games range to high standards, and this is no exception.

In English speaking countries it was published as Siege, or German Tactics.  Since it is played on essentially a Fox &amp; Geese board with additional markings and pieces, it was often included in a set with rules for Fox &amp; Geese and Solitaire.  The markings outline one nine-point side of the cross as a distinct fortress or castle, typically in a different color from the rest of the board's points.  Also, the horizontal lines of the board are in a different color than the rest, but for the few closest to the fortress.  This is to indicate where the attacker may not move; in some editions these markings are absent and instead simply described by the player's rules of movement.<br/><br/>The defending player has two pieces in the fortress, either on specific starting points or anywhere the player chooses, depending on the included rules.  The other player has twenty-four pieces, one on each of the board's remaining points.  The goal for the attacking player is to occupy all nine of the fortress points with one of his pieces.  The goal for the defending player is to reduce the attacker to eight pieces, thereby preventing occupation of the fortress.<br/><br/>Attackers may move along the vertical or diagonal lines towards the fortress only, except on the few marked horizontal lines near the fortress.  They may not jump or capture any pieces.  The defenders may move in any direction along any line, and may capture (remove from the board) an attacker's piece by jumping over it to a vacant opposite point.<br/><br/>Siege evolved further into a larger edition with a sixty-seven point board, seventeen points for the fortress (and three defending pieces) and fifty points for the attackers.  Sometimes published in Germany and continental Europe as Neues Belagerungsspiel (New Siege Game) or Grosses Festungs-Spiel (Big Fortress Game,) it was known in English-speaking countries as The Royal Garrison Game and has been published under many other names since then.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["1870-71 Franco-Prussian War Edition", "Cavalry with Green Surround Edition", "Damm Norwegian edition", "Dearborn Industries edition", "Dourios Greek pocket edition", "Eggenweiler first edition", "Game Crafter edition", "Game Crafter mat edition", "German edition", "HABA wooden edition 1987", "HEMA Dutch edition", "Ives edition", "Juegos Ya S.L. edition", "Karto Portuguese edition", "Klee German edition", "Koster Brothers Egel-spelen edition 1964", "Kronheim & Co. edition", "Noris edition", "Piatnik German edition", "Portuguese edition", "Schmidt German edition", "Swedish edition 1839", "Tactic Swedish edition", "VEB Berlinplast German edition", "W&S B edition"], "average": "5.36905", "name": "Asalto", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement", "Point to Point Movement"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "42", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games", "Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Hunt games", "Marble Games"]}, "25989": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Truth, Dare or Damnation!", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2005", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic153580_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Kheper Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic153580.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Humor", "Party Game"], "age": "18", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Description from Khepher Games website:<br/>&quot;The party game where you're damned if you do, and even more damned if you don't!

To control complexity and present an overall-force-commander's-view of the battle, the game uses a tactically scaled map and units of maneuver coupled with an operationally scaled game turn length.
