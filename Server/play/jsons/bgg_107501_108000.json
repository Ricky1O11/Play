The active player draws a card which contains a location (like the Giseh Sphinx, for instance) and then places a transparent round disc on the world map, centering it where s/he believe the thing is located. Then an semi-circular marker is placed around the disk to show where it was placed and the disk is removed. The card is now turned around and reveals which quadrant of the board it belongs to. The quadrants are card-sized, and the cards show a cross with the precise location. Afterwards, the disc is put back on top of the cards - it contains concentric rings which mark how far the player was off. Points are scored depending on how close the player guessed the location.<br/><br/>"}, "107502": {"rpgartist": ["Patrick Adams", "David Anderson (III)", "Rachel Dorrett", "Romeo Gonzalez", "Imperia Studio", "Tisha Leonardo", "Vinod Rams"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Edge Role Playing Game", "rpghonor": ["2012 ENnie - Judge\u2019s Spotlight Award Winner"], "rpgproducer": ["Caitlin Bergeron", "Cameron Macdonald"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2339729.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgdesigner": ["Steve Bergeron", "Caitlin Bergeron", "Kirk Bittman", "Diana Gurney", "Angela Hug", "Quinton Oliviero", "Adrian Rawle", "Patrick Reigert", "David Sawyer"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Edge"], "rpgpublisher": ["Outrider Studios"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2339729_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Where all things collide, there is the Edge.

In Crocodile, players have to explain words using only movements and gestures.

Players are divided into teams, and then each team will take turns: one player has one minute to explain as many words as possible while the other team members try to guess them quickly to gain more points. Words will be worth more or less points depending on their difficulty, as they could be anything from ordinary objects to entire phrases.<br/><br/>In addition, the team can use special cards that can change the entire course of the game. These &quot;U-cards&quot; can be played before the player begins explaining words, and include abilities such as:<br/>- &quot;First letter&quot;: You are allowed to say the first letter of the word;<br/>- &quot;Additional minute&quot;: You are given one additional minute to explain;<br/>- &quot;Replace a player&quot;: You can change the player who is going to explain the words - this lets competing teams gain an advantage by preventing good players from participating. <br/>- &quot;With closed eyes&quot;  - Have you ever tried to explain something without seeing others?<br/>- &quot;Robbery&quot;: You can guess the word of another team and steal their points<br/><br/>The game contains 200 cards with words.

It was expected to be a normal working day when suddenly the upper galleries of the gold and copper mine collapsed, causing the miners to be trapped for months. In this rescue mission game, you and your team must try to overcome all odds in order to rescue these thirty three (33) trapped miners. To be successful, you and your team must meet all the government&rsquo;s mandatory health, safety and environment (HSE) standards, acquire the necessary gears, and endeavor to avoid danger zones. Remember, the perils and rewards are high - just when you think you are about to enter the chamber to rescue a trapped miner, your mission might suffer a setback as the other rescue team progresses.

Lives are at stake! The longer you wait, the more unlikely it will be that the trapped miners will survive. Can you rise to the challenge?

Each player begins with 7 cards from one of the 2 decks and must attempt to play his cards to a community board.  The board is divided into 2 sections, and players must play cards only to their designated spaces on the board, only when adjacent to other placed cards, and only into 1 section per turn.  Players may choose to (or may occasionally be forced to) draw simultaneously from both the Book Deck (which has more of the same cards that were dealt initially) and the Providence Deck (which enables special placements).  Some cards are setbacks when drawn, while others allow opponents to save each other from the setbacks (and benefit themselves in the process.)<br/><br/>The game can be played in either of 2 ways.  The Standard Version contains a few extra cards which force play to the board and which create blockages on the board that can be removed only through cooperative effort.  This extra layer of complexity provides opportunity for cooperative play and additional strategy which is not available in the much simpler Family Version of the game (which is better suited for children and casual gamers.)  In addition to removing a few cards from the decks, the Family Version allows for a different ending to the game: where the Standard Version is resolved in a Discard Phase that awards victory to the lowest scorer, the Family Version is won simply when any player goes out, having played all their cards on their turn.<br/><br/>Words of Wisdom: the Game has an overtly Biblical theme.  The numbered board spaces represent the 66 books of the Bible, and the cards in the Book Deck represent individual books of the Bible.  The cards in the Providence Deck channel Bible-based occurrences such as Trials, Miracles, Prophecies, and Parables.  Nevertheless, the theme is as light and non-intrusive as the game play is: the rules state that no familiarity with the Bible is necessary to play, enjoy, or win the game.

Some weapons can be used several times, some only once.<br/><br/>Unlike Final Fight, at the half of the first level, players will have to choose between three routes to walk through, each having their own difficulty. At the end of each later level, players will face a boss, and when he or she is defeated, he or she will join in and become playable while the players can select whoever teamed up with the last characters players played, except for the last two Dr. D and TX-No.3. Another feature that differentiates it from other beat 'em ups is when a player is knocked to the ground, an &quot;Angle Power&quot; bar appears, requiring the player to rapidly press the punch button to fill it up before it vanishes. When successfully filled, the players' characters will be lightning charged and automatically perform their special moves while setting any nearby enemies on blue fire and stay charged up for a short time. Players are also able to shoot blue flames with the punch buttons while charged.<br/><br/>In order to access &quot;1P vs. 2P Mode&quot; (or &quot;VS. Mode&quot; according to website and flyer), players must insert two coins to access this mode similar to most fighting games at the time, choose between the three heroes and five bosses and knock out one another in two-out-of-three rounds. The winner will either move on to fight against CPU players or another real player will join in and choose a character, while the winner will not be able to select another character. The fighting rules are the same as &quot;Mission Mode&quot;, but in versus-style.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Big Fight: Big Trouble in the Atlantic Ocean&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "107667": {"poll": [], "name": "Combat Leader", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA Atari 8-bit Cassette edition", "NA Atari 8-bit Diskette edition", "NA C-64 edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2534833.jpg", "videogametheme": ["War - Modern", "War - Vietnam War", "War - World War II"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Strategic Simulations, Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Real Time Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Atari 8-bit family", "Commodore 64"], "average": "8", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Strategic Simulations, Inc."], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2534833_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the box<br/><br/>It used to be when we wanted to make a strategy wargame full of realistic rules, historical accuracy and challenging options, we had to give up a bit on speed.

COMBAT LEADER combines the best of both worlds to give you one of the finest - and fastest - tank-battle games ever!<br/><br/>COMBAT LEADER - as its name implies - was designed to put you in charge of a battle force of tanks and mechanized infantry against a similarly-equipped enemy (controlled by the computer).

Your troops are always on-screen while realistic visibility rules have enemy units flashing on or off (this depends on whether at least one of your men has spotted them or not).<br/><br/>You can even choose the level of command you want: company commander, platoon leader, or squad leader.  At your disposal are over 70 tanks, each historically rated for armor thickness and strength, speed and fire accuracy.  You can choose from the classic Nazi Tiger tank to the ultra-modern Abrams M-1.<br/><br/>When you use the joystick and simple one-key keyboard commands, your men will execute your orders in real time.  They look, move, stop, retreat, advance, patrol and fire the instant you tell them to do so.  No waiting, no delaying.

The 74th Division of the Chinese 57th Army (nicknamed as &quot;Growling Tiger Division&quot;) was ordered to defend Changde and fate will decide the outcome of the battle.<br/><br/>The Battle of Changde began on 18th November 1943 when the Imperial Japanese 11th Army under the command of Isamu Yokoyama already approached the strongholds in the suburbs of Changde with around 20,000 men under three divisions. The Japanese 116th Division in the northwest began to attack the Chinese defenders at Huangtu Mountain and the Hefu Mountain while the Japanese 68th Division in the east began to attack Shigongmiao and Xinmin Bridge (XinminQiao). The Japanese 3rd Division in the south advanced towards the southern bank of Yuan River after they took Deshan. On 25th November 1943 these three Japanese Divisions were outside Changde City.<br/><br/>The Chinese garrisons in the fortifications inside the city near the eastern, northern and western gates engaged the Japanese Forces continuously without any rest with the Japanese having firepower supremacy in both air force bombardments and artillery fires. On 28th November 1943, Japanese General Yokoyama launched simultaneous attacks on all the four gates. Despite the Chinese 57th Division fought valiantly, the city wall had fallen.<br/><br/>At the same time, reinforcements from the Chinese 19th Division were advancing towards Hefu and the 190th Division had begun to counterattack from the east. At this very moment, the overall commander of the defending garrison at Changde, Division Commander Yu Ching Man issued his last telegraph to Sun Lianzhong in this battle. &quot;No more ammunition, without reinforcement, the city has fallen.&quot;<br/><br/>Sun was the deputy commander of the Sixth Front On 1st December 1943, reinforcements from the Chinese 10th Army have captured positions at Deshan and the Chinese 3rd Division and the 10th Division were approaching from the southern bank to help the Changde garrison though they were unable to contact with the 57th Division, thereby failing to make concerted attack. On 3rd December 1943, the Chinese Regiment Commander Chai Yee Sun died gloriously while leading the last Chinese combat unit when covering the retreat of General Yu Ching Man and the remnants of the 57th division. On 6th December, the Japanese found themselves attacked by seven corps from the Chinese Sixth Front and the Ninth Front and the Japanese high command decided to withdraw to prevent the annihilation of the Japanese 11th Army.<br/><br/>On 7th December, General Yu Ching Man led the remnants of the 57th Division and coordinated with the 11th Division to attack Changde. On 9th Division, the Chinese entered the city through the Eastern gate and recovered Changde City. The Japanese withdrew back to the original frontline in early January 1944. In this battle, less than 300 of the original 8,000 defenders survived and the Japanese lost more than 4,000 soldiers in the sieget with total casualties of the campaign around 10,000.

Winning solo is tough, so players need to negotiate, make deals and form alliances. To do this, players use their three embassy pawns; by spending a pawn, a player can have a three-minute-long private conversation with one or more other players to make whatever deals they wish. You have only three pawns, so plan well for these talks!<br/><br/>Players draw cards each round: character cards that can bring new lords into play and event cards such as good harvests, good weather and taxes. They pay the costs to play cards, with some cards being playable at any time to upset current events with a surprise assassination or underground invasion. Players then receive income, with which they can buy troops and buildings, and move lords and troops among villages, with troops never being able to travel without a lord. If troops from more than one player end up in the same village, they battle until one side is eliminated or forced to flee.<br/><br/>If a player controls all villages in a fief and has at least one castle there, he can purchase the title of the fief and assign it to a lord, with the title being passed to an heir if the lord subsequently dies.

The Russians, alerted by their intelligence network, were well prepared for the attack.  The battle that followed was to be the largest tank battle of World War II.  Germany's IX Army, responsible for the northern strike, advanced only six miles and was immediately repulsed.  The IV Panzer Army, attacking from the south, was more successful.  Before being defeated, it was able to penetrate 25 miles to the town of Prokhorovka, just 50 miles short of Kursk.  OBJECTIVE: KURSK is the grand-tactical simulation of this southern conflict.<br/><br/>The Game<br/>Consider its scope: 12 Panzer and Panzer Grenadier divisions and 9 Soviet armored and mechanized infantry corps - a sum total of more than 4000 tanks!  It is the first computer game ever to resolve such a massive battle down to every tank, every gun, every infantryman!  How did we do it?  By harnessing the power of the computer to its fullest.  Our sophisticated program takes care of all of the number crunching and administrative headaches so you won't have to.  Not only is a game of such detail and scale practical, it is also fun and fast!<br/><br/>Starting early in July 1943, this game gives the Germans 11 days to take their objective: Kursk.  As in the real battle, the task is anything but easy.  If you're playing the Germans, your advance will be impeded by the endless minefields that your engineers must clear.  Then, there is the rain - the frequent, awful downpour that turns the Russian countryside into paralyzing gullies.  All this before you even worry about the 2000 T-34 and KV-1 tanks of the Russian Army waiting for you!  Your only advantages are the superior morale of your troops and the fact that you move first.  But perhaps, these two factors - coupled with your skill and cunning - will be enough to change the historical outcome of the Battle of Kursk.<br/><br/>By Gary Grigsby<br/><br/>"}, "107730": {"poll": [], "name": "Rugby Challenge", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Australian PlayStation 3 edition", "English/European PlayStation 3 edition", "North American Xbox 360 edition"], "average": "7.33333", "videogameseries": ["Rugby Challenge"], "videogametheme": ["Sports - Other"], "usersrated": "3", "videogamedeveloper": ["Sidhe"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Alternative Software", "Home Entertainment Suppliers Pty.

Whether you've earned a Ph.D. in the science of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; or are discovering the world of Leonard, Sheldon, Howard, Raj, and their neighbor Penny for the first time, you're guaranteed to be laughing and having fun.<br/><br/>In each round, one player serves as Referee, flips over a Red card, and reads it aloud; if it has a green background and says &quot;Experimental Formula&quot; on it, the Referee indicates that as well. The other players &ndash; who have seven cards in hand &ndash; each submit one or two cards face down that they feel best describes the category or description on the Referee's card. For example, if the Red card says &quot;Often Leads to Disaster&quot;, you could submit a Blue card such as &quot;Killer Robot&quot;. If the Red card were an Experimental Formula, such as &quot;Hilarious Battle&quot;, you submit two Blue cards using your envelope, such as &quot;Horny Engineer&quot; and &quot;Giant Rabbits&quot;.<br/><br/>If any player has a &quot;Bazinga!&quot; card in hand and wants to play it, he must do so after each player has made a submission, but before the Referee has revealed them! The Referee then reveals cards from the Red Deck until he reveals a card of the same type (either Basic or Experimental Formula) as the original card, thereby creating entirely new criteria by which to evaluate those same submissions.<br/><br/>Next, the Referee mixes up the submitted Blue cards or envelopes so that no one knows who submitted what. Then, the Referee turns all of the cards face up, reading each card name aloud. He then ranks each card (or pair of cards) in the order he feels best matches the criteria on the Red card. The first place submission is awarded the highest numbered point chip, which is taken from the pile, the second place submission is awarded the second highest point chip, and so forth.

Elle peut bien &eacute;videmment aussi servir de sc&eacute;nario d&rsquo;introduction pour des joueurs exp&eacute;riment&eacute;s d&eacute;couvrant Twin Galaxies ou encore pour lancer une nouvelle &eacute;quipe de Personnages ou m&ecirc;me constituer un sc&eacute;nario de transition moyennant quelques adaptations.<br/><br/>Google Translation<br/>This adventure is fairly simple especially intended to serve as an introduction to scenario role-playing game for beginners and a Game Master may itself novice.

In common with their other titles, the Beagle Bag software was released in unlocked and unprotected form, and is now in the public domain.<br/><br/>Buzzword!<br/><br/>In Buzzword!, a children's game based on Mad Libs, the computer relates a short story in which certain key words are replaced with blanks. Each time the story reaches a blank, the user selects a letter and the computer then randomly inserts a word from its vocabulary starting with that letter. Buzzword! comes with five pre-made stories and also allows users to create their own.<br/><br/>In addition to entering a custom story, the Beagle Bag manual also includes instructions about how to edit Buzzword!'s vocabulary.<br/><br/>Elevators<br/><br/>Elevators challenges the player to use four elevators to deliver as many carloads of passengers as possible in a short period of time (5:00 to 5:30). Passengers appear on any of ten different floors in a high-rise building and must be collected by sending one of four elevator cars to the correct floor and back down again. The movement of each car can be controlled separately by three rows of keys: 1, 2, 3 and 4 to move up, A, S, D and F to move down, and Q, W, E and R to stop. Power can also be cut to certain cars, allowing others to move more quickly.<br/><br/>Each carload of passengers delivered to the ground floor earns the player a point. Points are displayed to the left of the building, the time of day to the right.<br/><br/>Gas Crunch<br/><br/>This simple game involves taking turns with the computer to remove gas cans from a wall. Both the player and the computer can choose to remove one, two or three cans each time, with the object of not having to take the last remaining can.<br/><br/>Hang Person<br/><br/>Hang Person is a simple hangman-style game in which the player must guess the letters of a word or short phrase. For each incorrect guess, another piece of the person is drawn in; six incorrect guesses lose the game. Hang Person allows a user to play by themselves against the computer, or to enter a word of their own (up to 14 characters) that a second user must guess. Instructions on how to edit the computer's vocabulary of 150 words are given in the manual.<br/><br/>Magic Pack<br/><br/>This program acts as an aid to performing four separate magic tricks described in the accompanying manual: &quot;Plenty Questions&quot;, in which the computer attempts to guess the object someone's thinking of; &quot;21 Numbers&quot;, a number guessing trick; &quot;Next Word&quot;, in which the computer and the player create a logical series of words; and &quot;Card Scanner&quot;, in which the computer purports to identify a playing card held against the screen.<br/><br/>Oink!<br/><br/>Oink! is a two-player dice-rolling game with each player taking turns rolling to score points. Players can reroll to achieve better results, but lose their turn if the dice show doubles. First to 200 points wins the game.<br/><br/>A version of Oink! was used in experiments conducted in the mid-1980s to test for the existence of psychokinesis, the results of which were published in the Journal of Parapsychology.<br/><br/>Pick-A-Pair<br/><br/>Similar to Concentration or H\u016bsker D\u016b?, Pick-A-Pair is a two-person memory game played on a 4x4 array of 16 numbers, behind each of which is a symbol. Players take turns revealing, two at a time, the symbols behind each number; if the two they pick match, the two are removed and the player earns points equal to the sum of the two numbers. The first player to earn 68 points wins the game.<br/><br/>Quick-Draw!<br/><br/>Quick-Draw! is a two-player cowboy shoot-out game. Each round the computer selects an abstract &quot;firing symbol&quot; which it displays between the two gunmen, then quickly cycles through various random symbols including the one it selected. If a player fires while the correct symbol is shown and does so quicker than his opponent, he'll win the round. If he fires while the wrong symbol is shown, his opponent get a free shot.<br/><br/>Points are awarded on how quickly players can make successful shots and are displayed beneath each cowboy. Scores rounded off to the nearest whole number appear on each cowboy's hat. First player to 10 points wins.<br/><br/>Slippery Digits<br/><br/>This game is a sliding puzzle that challenges the player to sequentially order 15 numbered tiles within a 4x4 playing area using as few moves as possible. Slippery Digits has two styles of play: one in which the number of each tile is shown, and another more challenging one in which each numbers begins hidden and only appears when it's in its proper position.<br/><br/>Sub Search<br/><br/>In this submarine-hunting game, the player must identify the locations of a random number of submarines hidden within the playing area. The player moves his ship north, south, east or west, and the areas over which the ship travels light up green. If a submarine is within the area through which the ship has moved, it will appear as a black silhouette; moving directly over a submarine marks it as found. To help direct the search, the player can use a sonar-like scanner to faintly reveal where submarines are located.<br/><br/>The player must manage oxygen and fuel supplies, both of which are assigned in random quantities at the beginning of the game and quickly diminish. An &quot;equalizer&quot; balances the two, and a &quot;jump&quot; function allows the player to jump to a random location in the playing area. The final score is based on the percentage of subs found multiplied by one thousand, plus the amount of fuel and oxygen remaining.<br/><br/>TextTrain<br/><br/>TextTrain is a train simulator that uses a word or other series of letter to represent the cars of a train. The game's object is to couple together a pre-defined series of freight cars and pull them to the Check Station at the top of the track as quickly as possible. The player can move the train forward or backward around the tracks and onto sidings, open and close switches and couple and uncouple cars. Coupling a car ahead of the engine or driving into a closed switch will derail the train and end the game.<br/><br/>Triple Digits<br/><br/>TripleDigits is a numbers game for two players. Each player is dealt a set of thirteen digits (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8); one plays white, the other black. Numbers are placed one at a time in the unoccupied squares of a 9x8 board according to the computer's instructions. Scoring is based on the number that was played and its two adjacent digits, read together as a single number; for instance, a row of 2, 4 and 6 would yield a score of 246. Rows can be vertical, horizontal or diagonal. TripleDigits ends when all the numbers have been played or one of the players resigns.<br/><br/>Wowzo<br/><br/>The object of Wowzo is for each player to move his &quot;man&quot; (represented on the board by the first three letters of his name) through the maze and land on each letter of a five-letter keyword before his opponent does.

You start out with a single character (from one of seven regular species), and can add up to 9 additional, individually defined followers. All characters start in their home system, Star Date 2918.1, with a Transport Cyborg and 30,000 Frilbees (the standard interstellar currency). Armed with this basic stake, and a few weapon and advanced skills, the player guides their character through life in the interstellar society of the 30th century. This life, at first, consists primarily of meetings with an ever-changing variety of your fellow creatures, including some very strange ones. These meetings are your source for money (job offers and seffing rare items), skill advancement (job offers and RNA tabs) and, most importantly, fellow adventurers. You can get followers by hiring them from the creatures you meet or by buying a special species, for example, a warrior robot.<br/><br/>After you've gotten a band of adventurers together, equipped them, and trained them, you'll be ready for the next step -- taking them out on an adventure. These adventures can vary from exploring strange alien worlds for the Adventurer's Guild to working on cases for the Agency or the Space Patrol to visiting the ancient sites of a vanished race for the Sensitive's Guild to whatever your imagination can devise. If you survive your first adventure, you'll become a Trial Adventurer. This is just the first step on the road to the highest honor: the title of Independent Adventurer. There are many possible paths to the top, but they are all long, dangerous, and exciting.<br/><br/>Galactic Adventures, in addition to being a role-playing game, is an adventuring system. The various home systems and existing adventures provide a framework within which you can create your own adventures. These adventures can include activities such as piloting your own space ship through a hyper-gate; space battles with Gorsai pirates; hand-to-hand combat with such creatures as berserk robots, the Mole People, mutants, and anything else you want to create; and performing jobs ranging from picking a lock to working with a quantum black hole.

We've put years of time and effort into this release and hope you enjoy it. To help get you familiar with some of the new features and enhancements, we've written a number of articles and will be adding more as time permits. Enjoy the site!<br/><br/>What is Falcon 4.0?<br/><br/>If you're new to Falcon 4.0, (&quot;F4&quot; for short), F4 is a combat flight simulator originally developed and released December 12, 1998 by MicroProse. It models the Lockheed-Martin F-16C Block 50/52 in a full-scale war on the Korean Peninsula. F4 has been popular among combat sim pilots due to its dynamic war campaign engine, detailed aircraft avionics, and multi-player capabilities. Continual development of the simulation by community members has allowed F4 to live on years after the MicroProse studios were shut down and official development of the sim ceased.<br/><br/>Who are we?<br/><br/>Benchmark Sims is one of the few remaining F4 development groups comprised of &quot;community members&quot;. Our first beta release for an F4 mod was in September of 2003. We've done our best to add still more improvements to F4 in the meanwhile. &quot;Falcon BMS&quot; is now the official name of our community mod for the original Falcon 4.0.<br/><br/>What have we accomplished?<br/><br/>BMS has worked on an array of features and our goal with the articles is to try and bring back that same excitement the old MicroProse developer's notes gave us all years ago. We could just say something like &quot;we've coded a new flight model&quot; but without any documentation, there would be no appreciation as to just how difficult it was, how long it took to get right, or how detailed it is. We think some of our features will make your jaw drop--it does ours!

The objective is to collect the best Fortune Hand from several rounds of drafting. The twist is that players control the number of cards to draft, points they score, and Fortune Hands they make through a common mechanism that leads to many strategic decisions and tactical plays.<br/><br/>Players begin with ten cards and starts by drafting five cards. Players will then play cards or pass. Each card they play will reduce the number of cards to be drafted next, as well as be the additional stakes of the player. The cards played will also form a common pool of cards that players can use to form the best Fortune Hand. Once four cards have been played, players can either play the fifth and final card or draw and discard a card.<br/><br/>The discarded card can be stolen by other players, so players have to be careful with discards and the ever-increasing stakes as the game progresses. Once the fifth card is played, the players will compare Fortune Hands and the winner will score points based on stakes played and a Fortune Modifier. The game ends after every player has a chance to deal, or after a pre-agreed number of rounds.<br/><br/>To excel in F3, you will need the cunning of a boardgame player, the opportunistic instincts of a Hold'em player, the tactical savvy of a Mahjong player, and the risk-taking skills of a Hanafuda player.

Nestled on the northern shores of Lake Winandermere (nowadays known as Lake Windermere), it&rsquo;s a place where everyone knows their neighbors, works hard from dawn until dusk and attends mass every Sunday. They bring in their crops, haul in their fishing nets and work in their shops.<br/><br/>However Dunbriar is a place with a sinister past. Not long ago the village suffered a drought, a Viking raid and a plague all in the same year. After so much tragedy the people of Old Dunbriar, those who were left, fled. For three years the village lie abandoned. There were tales of witchcraft, strange creatures stalking the forests around the village and satanic influence over the village, which people took to calling &quot;Thrice Damned Dunbriar.&quot;<br/><br/>Things are different now, people have returned, building new lives for themselves. The people of the Dunbriar colony are looking forward, to the future. However the past is not dead, but lurking all about the peaceful seeming community. Secrets are waiting to be discovered, old threats are returning and dangers lurk around every hillside, behind ever tree, beneath the still waters of Lake Winandermere and even under the very feet of those living there. No one knows the truth of Dunbriar&rsquo;s past, and those ignorant of the past may be doomed to repeat it.<br/><br/>Thrice Damned Dunbriar is a fully detailed setting for Cthulhu Dark Ages, in the style of the classic &quot;Lovecraft County Series.&quot; It contains four scenarios, allowing players to take on the role of new colonists of the Dunbriar Colony, although the setting is perfect for use as a pre-established setting.<br/><br/><br/>admin comment<br/>moved to (Unpublished Products) on August 23, 2016<br/>we assume this was never published due to the death of Keith Herber<br/><br/>"}, "107820": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1085622.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Alan R.

However, more recently it has been made available free.<br/><br/>Captain Comic II is a platform game and like its predecessor has the concepts of shield points (health), lives, a score, items, enemies, zones and objectives.<br/><br/>The primary health indicator is the shield. Once the shield points are exhausted by coming into contact with enemy units and then he is struck again (or if he is hit for more damage than his remaining shields), Comic loses a life. Additionally, if Comic falls off the bottom of a screen a life is lost. If Comic finds a bonus shield it will restore the points to maximum, or add the shield to his inventory for later use if already at full. The game is over when Comic loses all of his lives (or completes the main objective of the game).<br/><br/>Bonus items can generally be found in strategic locations or inside boxes or crates that need to be opened up or destroyed by use of the pick-axe tool (one of the first goals of the game should therefore be to obtain the pick-axe). Items range from gems (points), shields (health), to tools that can be used for other purposes. A notable addition is the magic wand which can turn some useless items into useful items, ranging from powerups to keys. Generally, items also add to the game score when collected. One new feature in this version of the game is the ability to change &quot;active&quot; it (perhaps a requirement since there are now many more items to collect and use). For example, the primary item in use is the firing weapon, but when it is time to use the pick-axe tool (or key, or screwdriver, etc), Comic can select that item from his inventory.<br/><br/>Comic must also avoid or destroy various enemies in the game, primarily by use of his firepower which he obtains by collecting Blastola Cola (again, one of the first goals early in the game should be to acquire this item). Enemies range from simple units on pre-set paths to more difficult combatants that follow Comic or seek him out directly. Some enemies move faster than others, and most are restricted to their domain (fish enemies in water, for example). All enemies have the same general property in that when they come in contact with Comic they are destroyed, but reduce his shield points accordingly (from one to four shield points depending on the enemy, as opposed to two regardless of type in Captain Comic). Destroying enemy units by shooting them also increases the game score (100 to 400 points, depending on how many shield points would normally be deducted - note that some enemies cannot be destroyed by shooting them).<br/><br/>The game is divided into major areas, each with smaller zones. Passing from one zone or area into another marks a safe point (although this version of the game also has a save-game feature). Typically areas are identified by the presence of doorways, which require the correct key (in the previous Episode one key opened all doors; in this Episode there are multiple keys denoted by color or design).<br/><br/>Comic can complete the main objective in the game, by successfully navigating areas and obtaining items (particularly tools) in what can be viewed as smaller objectives. For example, Comic must find the local leader to get the storyline, but also direction on obtaining the 'Temple Key' as a first objective. But there is also the side effect of learning where to acquire the pick-axe (from the guys working on the Escape Pods). As Comic works his way through the stages of the game, he collects more and better items to help with the increasingly difficult areas (particularly with regard to the enemies he must face).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Captain Comic II: Fractured Reality&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "107824": {"poll": [], "name": "Megapanel", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer"], "videogameversion": ["JP Mega Drive edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Abstract"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Namco Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["SEGA Genesis"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Namco Ltd."], "description": "MegaPanel is a 1990 puzzle video game produced by Namco for the Sega Mega Drive.

When monsters die you have to quickly snatch up the loot they drop before it disappears, and sometime you must take action by dropping some sort of grenade and blow the little guy up.<br/><br/>If you think you know everything about strategy, action and defense games then you must try Monster Trouble, and even though it may feel familiar you will discover enough small tweaks in the gameplay to make it a worthwhile experience.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "107900": {"poll": [], "name": "Continuity 2: The Continuation", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android edition", "iPhone/iPad Universal edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1624093.png", "videogameseries": ["Continuity"], "videogametheme": ["Abstract"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)", "Ragtime Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform", "Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone"], "average": "7", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "Noodlecake Studios", "Ragtime Games"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1624093_t.png", "description": "Continuity 2: The Continuation is a puzzle game for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch.

Players use cards to activate their planes and pilots, and to stymie (Trump) the moves of their opponents. Play is very interactive, intense and true to the history.<br/><br/>The colorful counters represent all of the major aircraft of the period, and pilot cards portray the famous aviators. In more detail, the game includes 36 different planes, from the first race winner (the Travelair R 'Mystery Ship') to the iconic Gee Bee R-1 and Roscoe Turner's 'Gilmore'. Planes are rated for endurance, turning radius, ability to climb or dive and speed. Thirty-three different pilots are represented, including pilots such as Jimmy Doolittle, Steve Wittman and Howard Hughes. Each pilot is rated for his skill level and fatigue. A deck of 54 Action Cards are used by players to move and maneuver their planes as well as rallying their planes and pilots. Players may also play cards on other players to disrupt their game.<br/><br/>Each game of September's Eagles comes with a full color and extensively illustrated Rules of Play booklet. In it is a comprehensive example of play to assist in learning the game.

The Allies anticipated the Germans would strike through neutral Belgium as they had in WWI, and planned on confronting them there on the Belgian plain.

TFX was programmed by the British company Digital Image Design and published by Ocean Software in 1993.<br/><br/>At the time, TFX graphics and realism with all options on (most players missed the realism settings in the SETUP menu) were far superior to any other home computer simulator of the time and most made even years ago, so much that it brought the attention of British and Australian military, and eventually DID become involved in military projects such as the TIALD laser designator trainer.<br/><br/>Even though its graphics and realism were acclaimed, the player was alone in most missions, maybe because most of the players had only 386 computers at the time, and having 3 or more planes at full realism/quality being simulated in an 386 or Amiga would make the game run very slow, at around 2 frames per second. For demonstration purposes in ECTS September 1993, a 486 DX4 100 MHz was used.<br/><br/>Ideally it is desired to run this combat flight simulation on a 80486 based PC @ 66 MHz or higher with an SVGA PCI graphics card to obtain good video graphic frame rates. The simulation runs rather nicely in DOS mode on an Intel Pentium microprocessor based PC.<br/><br/>The pilot could fly 3 planes: The Eurofighter, the F-22 and the F-117. The payload for each plane could be fine-tuned by the player according to mission type.<br/><br/>The possible modes of play included an instant-action arcade mode, custom missions or the campaign (Tour of Duty).<br/><br/>The campaign mode sees you taking the role of a pilot flying for the fictional, United Nations Air Force flying missions in one of five theatres (Colombia, Somalia, Libya, the Balkans and also the South Georgia Islands). The tour of duty was designed to offer a &quot;soap opera&quot; approach, where actions from the players would affect the world and following missions, as well as reaction in the front page of journals according to what the player did. The Eurofighter finally flew for the United Nations for real in March 2011 as part of the UN no-fly zone enforcement in Libya.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;TFX (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "107971": {"poll": [], "name": "QI the Board Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "58", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1089581_t.jpg", "average": "4.68103", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Paul Lamond Games Ltd"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 026 \u2013 Random Top 10 Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1089581.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Trivia"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Game based on the very funny 'quiz' show.

Designed for those players, that enjoy strategic planning and quick thinking.<br/><br/>QF is played using the same cards as the core set &ndash; each card has two symbols on it, there are 12 different symbols altogether. Most of the cards are identical to the ones in the core set, while others have different symbol combinations on them. The set also includes a few special text cards (action cards).<br/><br/>The goal of the game is the same as in The Enigma of Leonardo, to collect Secret Keys, by making sequences of identical symbols but this time the game is played on one big field. The field itself is made during game play, the only restriction being its size &ndash; 5x5 cards. The first card is placed in the middle of the playing field, players then take turns at playing cards, increasing the field. In the end, the first card that was played might not even be in the middle anymore, it could be on the edge.<br/><br/>Players can not only play cards on empty spaces, they can play cards on top of each other and can even replace cards from their hands with the ones on the playing field. The only condition is that the cards being replaced must share a common symbol. This playing mechanic allows for more complex combos, by careful planning, one can gradually replace all the cards on the field with symbols that the player needs.<br/><br/>Just like in The Enigma of Leonardo, in QF players receive Secret Keys when they successfully make a row of cards with the same symbol. But now you can get symbols not only for 3 cards in a row, but for four and even five identical symbols. Qunitis fontis actually means &ndash; &ldquo;the fifth symbol&rdquo;, when translated from Latin. Rows can be made horizontally, diagonally and vertically just like in the core game but now you can receive the same key more than once by first making a row of three symbols and then adding cards with the fourth and fifth symbol.<br/><br/>But it sounds much easier than it actually is. The game now uses a special counter-marker called &ldquo;veto&rdquo;. After playing a card, the player may choose to move the marker on any card (even the one he just played) on the playing field. The next player cannot play any cards that share a symbol with the marked card. It&rsquo;s up to the players to decide should they move the marker each turn or keep it in one place blocking a certain symbol combination for the entire game.<br/><br/>Another new addition to QF are the action cards. There aren&rsquo;t much compared to another expansion of the game The Enigma of Leonardo &ndash; Novem &ndash; but they can alter the flow of the game. With these cards you can steal symbols from your opponents and prevent them from gaining new ones.<br/><br/>The player who successfully collects seven Keys is the winner. If the deck is used up and no one has collected seven Keys, the one to collect the most is the winner. In case of a tie a key gradation has been provided.<br/><br/>QF is basically a harder version of The Enigma of Leonardo: the rules are different but the cards used are practically identical. Meaning you can try playing The Enigma of Leonardo using QF or vice versa. It will be a slightly different game, but it&rsquo;s still possible.<br/><br/><br/>Reimplements:<br/><br/>    The Enigma of Leonardo<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "107977": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Julien Percot", "Bertrand Rondeau"], "poll": [], "name": "Point Final", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1275243_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Percot Rondeau \u00c9ditions", "Pink Monkey Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1275243.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Percot Rondeau French first edition", "Pink Monkey Multilingual edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Word Game"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Most of the cards in this card game are letter cards, with which a word is formed; the rest are special action cards.
