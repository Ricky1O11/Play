You compete against other players to see who can build the most efficient set of factories in the shortest amount of time. Players roll their dice, run their factories, and sabotage their way into industrial dominance. Whether you&rsquo;re pursuing an empire building strategy, assembling a tight factory engine, or training your workers, there are many paths to victory.<br/><br/>In Fantastic Factories, you race to 15 victory points. There are elements of dice rolling, worker placement, engine building, resource management, tableau building, simultaneous play, and some card drafting. Each turn is split into two phases, the day shift and the night shift.<br/><br/>During the day shift, players simultaneously roll their dice and use their dice as workers to build and activate factories. Buildings start as blueprints and need to be constructed. Once constructed, each building can be used once each turn. Worker placement can happen in any order and figuring out the correct order will help you accelerate your engine. Each day shift is like solving a unique worker placement puzzle.<br/><br/>During the night shift, players choose to either acquire a new blueprint from the marketplace or purchase and play an action card. Action cards can be used to reinforce your strategy or disrupt other players' engines. These actions might be as innocent as hiring an extra worker or might be as destructive or sneaky as sabotage or industrial espionage.<br/><br/>Once a player obtains 15 victory points, the game is over and the player with the most victory points wins. With over 50 unique blueprints and countless synergies across buildings, each game is unique.

Each player knows the patron of at least one other player, but not their own. Each turn players select actions (charity, bribery or violence) and how these balance with the previous actions of the other players determines which councillor advances in power. By watching and analysing the actions of others, players may deduce who their patron is and push them to power. But what if someone was bluffing?

The board consists of a number of shops; each shop has a separate queue, and each space in the queue offers a different reward - from food items to trees to decorations. On a player's turn they first move all of their limited number of pawns one space down the queues they're in, then choose to either start a new pawn at the top of a queue or retrieve a single pawn from a queue and take the item they've reached. The player must take exactly one of these two actions, meaning they have to carefully plan ahead to make sure they don't run out of pawns before they reach their goals, and don't end up with more than one pawn on a desired space in the same turn.<br/><br/>The task is complicated by the opportunity to bump other players' pawns around in queues or make trick telephone calls that distract your opponents from their shopping, and the juicy bonus points on offer for inviting various relatives to come and have dinner with you... so long as you don't offer anything they don't like!<br/><br/>Ridiculous Last-Minute Christmas Shopping Family Brinkmanship is printable as a single A4 or US-Letter page, intended to be included in a Christmas Card; to play 4 coloured pawns, a pen or pencil and a piece of paper for each player are also required.<br/><br/>"}, "216628": {"rpgdesigner": ["David Concher"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Une Bouteille \u00e0 la Mer", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3312496.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Greyhawk"], "rpgproducer": ["Jean-Philippe Huet", "Ga\u00ebl Richard", "Tim Sech"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (3.5 Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Wizards of the Coast"], "average": "0", "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["EKB - Living Greyhawk Ekbir Regional Adventures", "EKB6 - Ekbir Season Six", "Living Greyhawk"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3312496_t.jpg", "description": "A One-Round Living Greyhawk Ekbir Regional Adventure<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/><br/>Le califat est sur le pied de guerre, les chantiers navals sont en pleine &eacute;bullition et l&rsquo;ensemble de la flotte participe au si&egrave;ge des &icirc;les Ataphades.

I'd rather have a system I can pick up and play within minutes than a system where character creation alone takes hours. So, when I was looking for systems I could use for a lovecraftian game, I was delighted when I found Cthulhu Dark by Graham Walmsley. It was an elegant, easy to grasp system and explaining the rules and creating characters could be done in less than 5 minutes, theoretically. However, it was also a bit too simple. So I was even happier when I found Cthulhu Grey, a hack by Aaron M. Sturgill, whose group also thought the system was too simple, prompting Sturgill to change and expand the original Cthulhu Dark, by adding, for example, a stat to represent physical harm and a rudimentary skill system to make the characters more distinct. However, that was not enough for me and my group. I wanted rules that could apply to campaign play. Another player wanted more options to define his character. We also found the Insanity and Harm systems lacking a bit. So me and Jakob got together and brainstormed some ideas. Some just refinements of Sturgill's system, some inspired by systems found in Call and Trail of Cthulhu, and even some new, original ideas. In the end, we came up with a system that, in our eyes, kept the spirit of Cthulhu Dark &ndash; a quick, easy to grasp system in which a character is defined almost entirely by words instead of numbers &ndash; but also improved it for players who still want a bit more meat to their gameplay and want to play some longer campaigns, with deteriorating physical and mental states and character progression.<br/><br/>We sincerely hope that other friends of lovecraftian horror and RPGs will enjoy this system.

This was a result of unforeseen technical problems coupled with communication limitations between Blizzard and the Russian animators at Animation Magic.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_Adventures%3A_Lord_of_the_Clans Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "216691": {"rpgartist": ["Jacob Blackmon", "Gennifer Bone", "Brian Brinlee", "Gary Dupuis", "Bob Greyvenstein", "Rick Hershey", "Brett Neufeld", "Michael Scotta", "Michael Syrigos"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Encounter Pages IV", "rpgdesigner": ["Perry Fehr"], "rpgproducer": ["Perry Fehr", "Mark Gedak"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3313605.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgsetting": ["Porphyra"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Purple Duck Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Encounter Pages"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3313605_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Mysterious Monsters, unknown until you experience the fatal encounter!<br/><br/>Angel jelly, dromopod, kukkoad, mawgriff, xenarthan&hellip; savage beasts and fell villains alike from the magical world of Porphyra, the Patchwork Planet!

But sometimes, it can be fun to take on the mantle of the otherworldly, and to embrace the alien terrors of the cosmos. Each installment of Weekly Wonders: Eldritch Archetypes contains five archetypes for eldritch characters&mdash;those that are weird, alien, and otherworldly, who don&rsquo;t fit in with normal society&mdash;as well as a cleric domain devoted to a specific mythos entity or race.<br/><br/>For this book, we focus on the dreaded plateau of Leng, a cold and desolate land in the realm of dreams, known for the strange denizens that make their home there, travelling from port to port on flying ships and taking slaves for their moon-beast masters. Featured primarily in The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath, by H.P. Lovecraft, Leng has been expanded upon in numerous works and stories. All of the archetypes in this book build upon the theme of dreams, and each one is tied to a different creature associated with that dark and terrible plateau that has haunted the nightmares of so many. This book contains the following archetypes:<br/><br/>    The fist of Leng, a brawler archetype that slowly transforms into one of the dreaded men of Leng, with goat horns and legs.<br/>    The spider&rsquo;s fang, a gunslinger archetype who serves the dreaded Leng spiders and has been granted several strange techniques by them.<br/>    The dreamquester, an occultist archetype that specializes in entering the world of dreams, and develops many useful contacts and allies in that strange and otherworldly realm.<br/>    The priest of the indescribable, an oracle archetype cursed with an appearance so hideous and alien that even looking upon her can cause madness and nightmares.<br/>    The shantak rider, a ranger archetype that gains a shantak as an animal companion, and is adept at traveling the world of dreams.<br/>    A bonus cleric domain devoted to those who adhere to the mysterious religion of Leng.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "216701": {"rpgdesigner": ["Cecil Howe"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "statistics": [], "name": "Do Not Let Us Die In The Dark Night Of This Cold Winter", "rpgartist": ["Cecil Howe"], "rpgproducer": ["Cecil Howe"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3313885.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "6.75", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy", "History", "Horror"], "rpgpublisher": ["Cone Of Negative Energy"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3313885_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>&ldquo;The harbinger of our agonizing death is the crow's shriek.

A doomed village is short on fuel, food, and medicine and the adventurers must strategically collect these supplies to keep the village folk from dying frozen and hungry in their beds. The game is lightly abstracted to fit in nearly any existing medieval fantasy role playing system just like a side quest or module would. Cold Winter uses a unique set of simple rules that create a tense atmosphere while adventurers plan each turn and fight against the nightmarish season. This product also comes with a set of map tiles for creating your own village map. Go from reading the rules to playing in less than an hour! A game with 4 adventurers will last just under two hours.<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/><br/>Do Not Let Us Die In The Dark Night Of This Cold Winter is a downtime activity, or mini-game, with a focus on helping an ill-fated frontier village survive a terrible winter season. Participants collect and manage supplies in an effort to keep the village folk alive despite the bleak, frightful conditions. It is designed to work inside of your regular fantasy role playing system and campaign with a slight separation of mechanics. As the game manager you become the village elder; tasked with setting the dour mood, keeping players on track, offering advice or strategy, and taking stock of the available supplies. Player characters become the adventurers; collecting and managing supplies while ensuring each villager receives what is needed most. The ultimate goal of Cold Winter is to keep the highest possible count of village folk alive as spring finally peeks from under the blanket of snow.<br/><br/>"}, "216704": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["The Four Color Hack"], "statistics": [], "name": "Battle in Jurgen Zeeger Park", "rpgdesigner": ["Mark Chance"], "rpgproducer": ["Mark Chance"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3314840.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Spes Magna Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3314840_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>H.U.R.T. has hired Brutacles and Mistcreant to spread terror as cover for the abduction of Princess Ekaterine of Western Jorassia.<br/><br/>H.U.R.T. - Headquarters of Unrepentant Terrorists<br/><br/>"}, "216705": {"rpgdesigner": ["Mark Chance"], "rpg": ["The Four Color Hack"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Four Color Hack", "rpgartist": ["Rudolf Montemayor"], "rpgproducer": ["Mark Chance"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3314845.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Spes Magna Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3314845_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>The Four Color Hack rips the heart from The Black Hack, and transplants that still beating organ into a Frankenstein's monster of a system.

Who can send the right delegate to parliament in order to influence the government legislative process, or erect distilleries, hotels and banks at the right moment to the benefit of his village?<br/><br/>Whoever has accumulated the most victory points in Cuba by the end of the game wins.

An additional game board, more and different ship cards, laws, buildings, new character cards to be used with the other characters, and a whole new phenomenon: Cuba - the Arrival of the President!<br/>In their turn, players may take and play a character from the 'El Presidente' board: the worker, dancer, attorney, warden, revolutionary or musician. They all have different effects.<br/>The worker puts your goods into the warehouse; all your goods are safe this turn. The revolutionary gives you one victory point, the musician two money. The player with the dancer card becomes immediately the new start player; the old rule for determining the new start player is no longer in effect.<br/><br/>With the attorney a player may use a building even when his supervisor is not on the row or column of this building, paying one money. The warden may change two adjacent ships in position. There are two mule cards being used when playing with less than five players; these cards cannot be chosen. When all players have chosen a card, the car of the president moves to the position of the remaining card; remember, there are six cards that each turn are shuffled and randomly placed.<br/><br/>Under each card on the board are symbols that come into effect when the car of the president stops there. The first makes all law proposals go into effect; the second makes it possible to move the supervisor anywhere on a player board in the next round. The next symbol also is in effect for the next round: it allows you to pay one money and overbuild a building with another; the difference in resources must be paid as well. One symbol makes the leading player to go back two points on the score track; another allows players to purchase market wares at discount prices. Players must now not only consider which role they would like to take, but also which position they likely want to be visited by the president.<br/><br/>There are 2 additional laws in each of the four categories, so that the game can now last up to 8 rounds instead of just 6.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Russian edition 2010"], "average": "9", "name": "\u041a\u0443\u0431\u0430: \u042d\u043b\u044c \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0435", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Voting"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Cuba", "Eggertspiele Cuba series"]}, "216728": {"rpgartist": ["Robert Hemminger"], "statistics": [], "name": "Heroes Weekly (Vol 6, Issue 22 - Nebula)", "rpgdesigner": ["Charles Smith"], "rpgproducer": ["Robert Hemminger"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgissue": ["Heroes Weekly"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "rpgpublisher": ["Avalon Games"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Packed full of great superhero fun, each issue offers a short adventure, an NPC, or some game mechanics for the Heroes Wear Masks system.

Select from a variety of heroes that play &amp; feel completely distinct from one another. Attack opponents and activate abilities by rolling your hero's unique set of 5 dice. Accumulate Combat Points and spend them on cards that have a large range of effects, such as granting permanent hero upgrades, applying status effects, and manipulating dice directly (yours, your teammate's, or even your opponent's).<br/><br/><br/>Let's take a look at a turn of a 1v1 game.<br/><br/>The game begins with 2 players selecting their heroes. Player One chooses Moon Elf and player two picks Barbarian. Each player begins the game with 50 HP (Health Points).<br/><br/>Player One (the Moon Elf) won the roll to go first. The Moon Elf draws their 4 starting game cards and begins the game with 1 CP (Combat Point). <br/><br/>    Note- The player that wins the starting roll does not draw a card (above their starting hand of 4) or gain CP above their 1 starting CP. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The Moon Elf then checks for status effects (like poison, or Burn) to resolve.<br/><br/>The next phase is called Main Phase (1). This is where the Moon Elf player can upgrade their hero board with cards from their hands if they have enough CP to pay for the upgrades. They can also play any Main Phase Action cards (blue cards).<br/><br/>Then they enter the Offensive Roll Phase. The Moon Elf can take up to 3 roll attempts (with their 5 dice) to accomplish an action or attack from their hero board. After deciding on an action within the 3 roll attempts an action is declared.<br/><br/>Then the Defensive Roll Phase begins where the opponent (Barbarian) can use their defensive roll (as it appears on their hero board). The amount of damage or incoming status affects are resolved and that concludes the Defensive Roll Phase.<br/><br/><br/>     During Offensive and Defensive Roll Phase any player can play Roll Phase Action cards from their hand as long as they have the CP to pay for it.<br/><br/><br/>The Moon Elf player enters their second Main Phase where they can do any final hero board upgrades or play blue Main Phase Action cards.<br/><br/>The Moon Elf then must discard any extra cards over 6 from their hand.<br/><br/>The Barbarian player begins his turn by drawing one additional card (over his starting hand of 4) and gaining one CP (Combat Point) for a total of 2.<br/><br/>The Barbarian then follows the same phases the Moon Elf.<br/><br/>The game alternates hero turns until one player is at 0 Health.<br/><br/><br/><br/>DiceThrone is for 2-6 players, ages 8+, and runs 20-30 minutes for a battle.

Each player is in charge of a Party, decides what gauge of the ideological spectre they want to represent, fight with other parties to be the preferred option for their voters and all of it while establishing alliances to reach government and develop their own policies.<br/><br/>This is a game for 2 to 5 players, and a regular game should last between 2 and 3 hours. Players handle a party by spreading its influence among the voter groups they want to represent, and from which they will gather the voters from. By playing actions and presenting laws in favour of these groups they will collect victory points, but at the same time it will grant voters to the groups affected negatively by those laws by altering the status quo, thus with every law the government pushes in their interests, the more likely that the opposition manages to gather a majority in the next election.<br/><br/>Turns represent a year, and in it several rounds are played. The main resource for the players come in the form of cards, and they can use it for either pay for actions or laws, to trigger the event the card includes or to fire up or cool down the public opinion. Every four turns (or earlier if the government's budget is turned down at the end of every turn) an election round is called and the players have to assemble a new government.<br/><br/>The other pivotal element is the stability of the country. Player's actions and random events modify the stability and how well the country as a whole works (unemployment, security, social integration, etc). This bar is bracketed between two values: Welfare on the low end (how bad things can get before people start rioting on the streets) and high end (how much bureaucracy and government intervention can cap the growth in good times). The stability can never get past the Red Tape value, and if it falls below the Welfare the board advances in the revolution track. If it's not properly handled, it's possible (though not easy) to trigger a civil conflict that ends the game and the winner is decided by which of the most extremist factions got more popular support.<br/><br/>The game is not so much a pure simulator but one that pretends to replicate the flow and the narrative that you can perceive in any country with a parliamentary government environment, and to such extend we believe we have achieved so.<br/><br/>"}, "216738": {"poll": [], "name": "Greedy Porker", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3326740_t.jpg", "average": "4", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Splash Toys"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3326740.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch first edition", "English first edition"], "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Kids game in which players &quot;feed the pig&quot; by alternating turns in which they flip a card representing different kinds of food.<br/>For each card flipped, the player flipping the card turns the dial a number of times according to the number on the card (the less healthy the food, the higher the number on the card).<br/>Each turn of the dial increases the pressure on the pig's stomach (a balloon).<br/>First player to make stomach/balloon pop looses the game.<br/><br/>"}, "216739": {"rpgdesigner": ["Joe Kondrak"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Petrified Plants", "rpgartist": ["Pushkin"], "rpgproducer": ["Russ Brown"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3314918.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Rusted Iron Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Deadly Gardens"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3314918_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Deadly Gardens is a series of short PDF documents that each feature a brand new plant monster to use in your Pathfinder Roleplaying Game or OGL campaigns.

They&rsquo;ve been bringing back small finds to town for the past few months, in order to keep up<br/>appearances, but two weeks ago, the visits ceased. Unfortunately for the &lsquo;miners&rsquo;, a young white dragon has decided to use their excavations for her new lair.

The game also featured an information book that ran over one-hundred pages long and taught science topics such as optics (via a run-in with the light police) and energy (with the help of Sheik Oil Slick).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarky_%26_Quaysoo%27s_Turbo_Science Quarky &amp; Quaysoo's Turbo Science]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "216995": {"poll": [], "name": "Metaltech: Battledrome", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American MS-DOS CD-ROM edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3318924.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Mech / Robot", "Science Fiction"], "videogamefranchise": ["Starsiege"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Dynamix"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS"], "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sierra Entertainment Inc."], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3318924_t.jpg", "description": "Metaltech: Battledrome is a video game in the Metaltech series.
