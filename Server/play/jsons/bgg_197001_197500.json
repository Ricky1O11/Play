It was designed by John Eternal for Train Jam 2015.<br/><br/>Clubs, Spades, and Jokers serve as monsters, hearts as potions, and diamonds as shields. Red numbered cards possess their face value with royals and aces equaling 11. Black numbered cards also possess their face value with Jack at 11, Queen at 13, King at 15, Ace at 17, and Jokers equal to 21.<br/><br/>The rooms of the dungeon are created by laying out cards in groups of four. Progress is made by playing all four dungeon cards or passing to another room when three of the four dungeon cards have been played. Four more cards are then dealt for the new room. Rooms can be reset in their entirety as many times as needed but never twice in a row.<br/><br/>Shields may be equipped to defend against monsters in descending order of their value with damage being dealt to the player for monster values in excess of the equipped shield. The shield breaks if it is used to attack a monster of equal or greater value than the previous monster. Attacking a monster without a shield depletes the players health for the full attack value of the monster. Health potions may be used to increase life points up to the maximum starting value of 21. Playing a second potion in succession nullifies the effect of the second potion.<br/><br/>The game ends when life points reach zero or the player has successfully slayed all monsters and exited the dungeon alive.<br/><br/>"}, "197005": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Where There's Smoke: A Fiery Adventure", "rpgdesigner": ["Devin Cutler"], "rpgproducer": ["Dale Robbins"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2987777.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2987777_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>The trade coaster Commus is up to something big, and its rivals want to know.

In the U.S., conflict in the westward movement was between the White Man and the Native Indian, and a common language united U.S. settlers. Language, however, has divided Canada ever since General Wolfe united the country by arms at the Plains of Abraham.<br/><br/>Canada&rsquo;s settlers pushed westward, led by fur-traders and trappers who were predominately French Catholic. These pioneers intermarried with the Native Indians, producing a new race and a new culture &ndash; the M&eacute;tis.<br/><br/>When the Canadian government made treaties with Native Indians, the M&eacute;tis, being neither Native nor White, did not receive any comparable consideration. Wanting to protect their rights against the remote Anglo-Protestant government in eastern Canada, resentment grew into rebellion in Manitoba's Red River Valley in 1869. Louis Riel led this resistance and forced the government into compromise, resulting in the Manitoba Act.<br/><br/>Due to his participation in the rebellion and in the execution of English Protestant, Thomas Scott, Riel himself was forced to flee to the United States. While residing there, Riel obtained American citizenship.<br/><br/>When trouble between the M&eacute;tis and the government occurred further west, in Saskatchewan, the M&eacute;tis recalled their former savior to lead them. Louis Riel and Gabriel Dumont, a local M&eacute;tis leader, initially worked toward a peaceful solution for their grievances. However, this movement eventually grew into a resistance, known as the North West Resistance. The Conservative government in Ottawa amassed a military force to crush it, and finally did at the Battle of Batoche, 9 &ndash; 12 May, 1885. Gabriel Dumont fled to the United States; tried and hanged for High Treason was Louis Riel.<br/><br/>There are many reasons why the first Riel resistance succeeded and the second failed. The westward expansion of the railroad allowed the federal government to deploy superior forces rapidly to the field. Riel himself embraced unorthodox religious views &ndash; views that alienated the Catholic Church and its devout supporters who were the key to his first resistance&rsquo;s success.<br/><br/>Now you enter the courtroom during those five fateful days of July, 1885, when the future of a country hung in the balance, and the defendant, Louis Riel, hanged in the aftermath.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "name": "High Treason: The Trial of Louis Riel", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Simulation"], "average": "7.65882", "usersrated": "68", "age": "13", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 36 - Eldritch Horror Review &amp; Arkham Horror: LCG Impressions", "Heavy Cardboard Episode 63 \u2013 High Treason!"]}, "197073": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3117741.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Brian Heasley", "Allison Markello", "Todd Markello"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2017", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Brian Heasley"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Fox and Ox Creations"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3117741_t.png", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Exploration", "Humor", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration"], "description": "Put on your best space suit and tie!

Turns last about 1 minute, and a game lasts 30-45 minutes. It is designed as a two-player experience, but it scales well and could be played with 3-4 players if you combine two games.<br/><br/>Players control outlaw crews zooming from battle site to battle site in deep space. The goal is to be the first to arrive, pick through the flotsam and derelicts to find the salvageable wreckage, and escape back to the nearest planet. There are shady deals and scams to be run on the side, too.<br/><br/>Navy patrols wander the area, intent on keeping pirates, bandits, and smugglers in line. The patrols monitor each player's &quot;wanted level.&quot; When a player has a high enough bounty or is caught with contraband too many times, the patrols will chase them down and exact revenge. Sometimes a ship's own activities will make them more wanted; sometimes a reliable tip off from a rival crew will do the trick.<br/><br/>This game consists of three components:<br/><br/>Cover &amp; Rules - 80# text paper;<br/>Board - 16 pt cover stock;<br/>Counter Sheets - 38 pt die cut chipboard.<br/><br/>Devils &amp; Black Sheep has a simple 3-part turn sequence.<br/><br/>1. Place New Wrecks: This is accomplished by rolling the die and following a placement matrix to determine where rumors of wreckage will lead you.<br/><br/>2. Navy Patrols Act: This will be a tame part of the game early on, but as your Wanted Levels increase from all your shady activities, it could get nasty.<br/><br/>3. Players Act: Choose one of the following actions:<br/><br/>Bribe: donate to an election campaign in exchange for a reduction in wanted level<br/>Bounty: place a bounty on a ship to increase its wanted level<br/>Fence: sell some of your loot to the local chop shop<br/>Raid: attack an opponent and steal some of their stuff<br/>Salvage: explore nearby flotsam for something of value<br/>Move: pretty self explanatory<br/>Smuggle: sell dark energy on the black market ... VERY illegal stuff<br/><br/>Degrees of Success - After choosing an action, players roll to see how well their action succeeded. The roll determines how successful your action was. This game specifically avoids the polarized success/failure result that commonly turns choices into all-or-nothing deals, and instead replaces it with a gambling mechanic.<br/><br/>Players roll the dice at the beginning of each turn to determine whether new reports of a recent battle reach the rumor mill of the local cantina. The rolls determine how much wreckage is rumored (some battles are larger than others, of course ... just as some rumors are more outlandish than others), and the sector and distance from the planet. These wrecks are derelict ships abandoned or destroyed in a recent battle. Every wreck has the potential to be salvaged for valuable (ish) flotsam, but the actual amount of salvageable junk won't be known until you arrive and check it out.<br/><br/>The local Navy Patrols then roll to see whether they are ordered to bring any of the outlaw crews to justice. Sometimes the patrols will simply move around and harass players.

The background was such that...<br/><br/>General Stilwell, who despised both British and Chinese (and the current American, except Marshall) leadership, wanted to fight the Japanese with Chinese troops, in Burma or in China. Roosevelt, while having no interest in rebuilding the British Empire, was at the same time incapable of seeing the Chinese Kuomintang regime as fascist as it really was. He often wanted to sack Stilwell for repeatedly reporting on Chinese incompetence and corruption.<br/><br/>Chiang Kai-Shek was more interested in getting his hands on the valuable lend-lease supply the US was sending him through Stilwell, who he hated, than fighting the Japanese. He was not keen on putting Chinese troops under Stilwell's command in Burma since they might become well trained and then possibly turn on Chiang. But he accepted doing so if Stilwell used them for opening up a supply route to China once again.<br/><br/>Churchill was not interested in Burma at all and wanted to focus on Singapore. Mountbatten, the Supreme Commander in India and Burma, wanted to attack into Burma, but through an amphibious assault further south instead. Wingate (some thought him to be certifiably insane) wanted to land special trained brigades in the middle of Burma and from there reconquer Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>General Slim, who had to put up with his rude and querulous colleagues, Stilwell and Wingate; his flamboyant chief Mountbatten; the hopeless and incompetent Chiang Kai-Shek, just wanted to defeat the Japanese there in the north and from there retake the rest of Burma.<br/><br/>In the meantime, in 1944, the Japanese, being outnumbered and with hardly any supply, said &quot;enough is enough&quot; and attacked. Why not? It worked in 1942. But this time Japanese hubris met Slim, the best British General of WW2, in the west; Stilwell's well trained and hard fighting Chinese troops in the North; Wingate's Chindit brigades in the middle amongst them; Chinese Yunnan soldiers who, after Chiang finally let them loose, took heavy casualties when investing the Japanese in the east. This time, after many ferocious battles, the Japanese met their Nemesis and were, in the end, utterly defeated.<br/><br/>Nemesis features my &quot;Open Game Turn&quot; system. The Game Turn consists of only four phases: Assault (where a unit may move and &quot;overrun&quot;); Attack; Supply Check; Reinforcement. The phases are drawn as chits, so you will not know in what order they will appear, with the exception of the first chit in a Game Turn which is chosen from the first three drawn chits in the previous Game Turn. Both players have a set of four Phase Chits each and they take turns drawing them. The game mechanics are easy to master. The game play may not.<br/><br/>The quality of the unit is the most important feature. Basically it affects four aspects: Not only will a high quality give an edge in combat, it also decides what kind of ZoC the unit is able to exert. The quality will decide how long a unit can be out of supply before attrition strikes, and how capable the unit is to make an operational move (a &quot;double move&quot;). Since ZoC is non-existent except when preventing enemy units conducting operational moves, it is very important which units you position and where you do so. Especially so, if you are uncertain of which phases there remain to be played.<br/><br/>The game will also feature my &quot;Active Combat&quot; system. A combat result will have step losses and probably a retreat result. Step losses are straightforward. The retreat result though has to be enforced by the attacker. That is usually not a problem if it is done by a high quality unit. A unit with lesser quality may have to pay with step losses in order to do so. The defender then decides to retreat or resist. If it stays, then it takes step losses, depending on its quality. Before any attack, the Japanese player has the option to get an DRM in its favor (in attack or defense). But it comes with a price.<br/><br/>Finally, there will be a two layer Victory Point system. There is a Satisfaction point track for each player. Some points can be actively acquired by you but are given once, usually those that will please your local commander. Some points can be actively acquired by the opponent and will be deducted every Game Turn from your track as long as the enemy controls them, usually those that displease your superiors. Then again, it is the same thing for your opponent. Those that you have received once are also the ones that are deducted each Game Turn from your opponent's track etc. In the end, as the commander, you will have to prioritize, depending on the current situation.<br/><br/>Nemesis has a high replay value and if you love tense games when in action as well as games that allow you to ponder on possible &quot;perfect opening moves&quot;, then this is the game for you.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "12", "name": "Nemesis", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "9", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Burma"]}, "197077": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Valter Ferreira"], "poll": [], "name": "Eco Planeta", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2960800_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Big Star Brinquedos"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2960800.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Children's Game", "Environmental", "Travel"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Eco Planeta is a light, educational game that simulates the work of a Environmental NGO trying to avoid the extinction and ill-treatment of animals on the planet.

All players can then narrate the Feast of Fools if desired.

It was developed by Marc Case for the 2012 Instructables Toy Contest 2.<br/><br/>Dungeon Crawl uses a standard deck of 52 playing cards with the Jokers removed and a character stat and score chart. Gameplay begins by selecting a Mage or Warrior character class and drawing cards from the deck to determine stats. Mages draw cards for hit points (HP) determining health and mana points (MP) for casting spells. Warriors draw cards for hit points (HP) determining health and shield points (SP) determining defense.<br/><br/>Gameplay progresses through a series of rooms each of which contains a single monster encounter. You begin the room by drawing cards to determine the stats of the monster including hit and damage points. Next you draw for initiative with the higher card determining the order of the battle between the player or monster. The monster and Warrior turns consist of drawing an attack card with the value determining the strength of the attack followed by an opposing evasion card with the color determining its success. The Mage turn consists of either a one point Melee attack with opposing evasion draw or an attack spell with opposing evasion draw. A Mage may cast an attack spell by turning over a mana card during the players turn or a shield spell by casting during the monsters turn. Player and monster alternate turns until one of them is defeated.<br/><br/>You progress to another room by defeating the monster. The defeated monster's HP is added to your cumulative score and all cards played during the round are shuffled back into the deck. Mages may sacrifice 10 score points at any time to regenerate the mana pool.

Killer Clowns from Hell brings you a sextet of madcap mummers, featuring demons, daemons, devils, and more ranging from CR 7 to 14, each with its own killer comedic style. While each embodies a particular type of cruel comedy, fighting one (or a deadly troupe of them) is no laughing matter. They are as deadly in combat as they are with a joke, and if the monsters themselves were not enough we also provide an assortment of magical treasures well-suited for the reckless ribaldry that these fiends represent and the sorts of twisted treasures they collect.

Like all parents before you, you want a better future for your family, and that future is definitely not on the cramped and environmentally exhausted Earth. You dream of a better life on the new colonies that have been rapidly expanding with the discovery of Faster than Light (FTL) technology 15 years ago.<br/><br/>The year is 2256 Earth is over crowded and its resources are stretched to the breaking point. Resource extraction colonies have been the norm for over a century but until recently they have been limited to the native solar system of humanity. The FTL system has led to a massive expansion of colonies throughout nearby solar systems most of these are resource operations for Earth&rsquo;s survival but a few habitable worlds have been found and brave men and woman have been sent by Earth to begin life again amongst the stars.<br/><br/>As a settler, you would be allowed to bring your family away from Earth and make a fresh start and possibly even make a name for yourself on the edges of known space.

You play as an unnamed adventurer who enters the deadly dungeon of Hebrac the sorcerer to defeat bloodthirsty creatures and recover four legendary treasures.<br/><br/>The game begins by shuffling the deck and laying cards down in piles of two within a 4x4 tableau. Each pair represents a room of the dungeon with a human or creature guardian concealing a treasure beneath. Each card of the deck is assigned unique properties based upon its position as guardian or treasure. Guardians include warriors, magicians, and demons to be fought, other adventurers who can be battled or bartered with, black and white priestesses who can harm or heal, steal from or reward you, merchants, and Hebrac himself. Treasures include magical objects that increase your stats, potions to heal your wounds, and various prisoners that can be released for reward or ruin.<br/><br/>You begin at one of the four corners of the dungeon and play through adjacent cards by turning them over and resolving them one by one by battling creatures using the deck and 15 maximum life points for resolution, bartering with gems collected from treasure cards, or casting spells, also collected from treasure cards.<br/><br/>You may progress to the next dungeon once half of the cards have been cleared.

The game follows the course of the pre-battle preparation and the first day of the battle itself.<br/><br/>It is not a balanced game and one where the British will find it very hard to win.<br/><br/>Game Overview<br/>To win the game the British player must capture two of the three German Support Lines.  To do this they must overcome the First and Second Lines of defence in sequence before succeeding in attacking the final German line of defence.<br/><br/>The game is turn based. The early turns consist of just one phase solely concerned with strategic actions by both sides. Later turns consist of a strategic phase followed by a tactical phase. A tactical phase consists of British attacks, and the much rarer German counter-attacks, played in sequence.<br/><br/>The switch to multi-phase turns represents the end of the initial bombardment and the beginning of the infantry battle.  The exact timing of the switch depends on whether the British player decides to prolong the pre-battle barrage or not.<br/><br/>Attacks, be they strategic or tactical, are made by playing a selection of cards.  Strategic cards can only be played in the strategic phase and likewise tactical cards can only be played in the tactical phase.  Furthermore, many strategic cards must be played immediately in the turn in which they are drawn so players do not have a totally free hand in deciding which cards to play.<br/><br/>The British player always takes the initiative unless the German player has chosen to counter-attack at the end of the tactical phase when the playing order is reversed.<br/><br/>Once the turn contains a tactical phase and the infantry battle has commenced, the British player must initiate at least one attack in every tactical phase. If they cannot attack, this counts as a failure.  Only when the British have completed all their attacks may the Germans counter-attack.<br/><br/>To reflect the difficulties faced by the British on the day, the game ends with a German victory if two consecutive British attacks have failed.

All players will score once, at the end of the game, based on the cumulative value of the Bones that he returned to the matching Dog Bowls.<br/><br/>There are 4 Bones in each of the 5 colors in the game. A Bone's value is determined at the end of the game, based on the distance of its corresponding Dog Bowl to the Dog House. The Dog Bowl that is closest to the Dog House will yield a value of 5 for each bone of that color. The Dog Bowl that is second closest to the Dog House will yield a value of 4 for each bone of that color, and so on. The Bowls and Bones will be swapped from the end of the Yard into the place of a recently dug up bone, continuously moving the 5 Bowls to the end of the Yard nearest the Dog House.<br/><br/>Each Yard Card has a Scent with 2 colors. The Bone on the opposite side of the Yard Card matches 1 of the colors of the Scent. This will help players determine which color Bone might be dug if that Yard Card is selected for digging.<br/>   One of the most interesting aspects of DIG is the unique &quot;Leap Frog&quot; Yard replacement mechanism. When a Bone is dug up, the Card that is furthest from the the Dog House, is removed and fills the empty spot created by the Dog. This action creates some interesting ways to influence which Bones and Bowls each Dog has close access to, but also makes timing critical for influencing Bone value for scoring.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, he may perform ANY or ALL of the following actions, but may only perform each action ONCE per turn.<br/><br/>MOVE: A player may move his Dog a maximum of 4 cards along the Yard Cards, and 1 less for each Bone he holds prior to movement. For example, if a player holds 2 Bone cards, he may move his Dog up to 2 Cards, moving below or above the Yard cards. A player may move his Dog in any direction. There is a movement legend on the bottom half of the Dog House for easy reference.<br/><br/>DIG: A player may dig up a bone and place the Bone card in his hand. Bones that are in the hand are kept secret until they are dropped off and placed in front of the player. The empty space created from the Yard Card removal is filled with the last Card at the edge of Yard. A player may have no more than 3 Bones in their hand at any time.<br/><br/>DROP: Drop a Bone into a Dog Bowl and place the Bone card from your hand to the playing area in front of himself, face up with the Bone visible to all players. A Dog must be AT the Bowl of the corresponding color in order to drop off any Bones of that color.<br/><br/>Game End and Scoring:<br/>   When Bowls are the only remaining Cards in the Yard (next to the Dog House), the game ends immediately and players total their scores.

The groups are presented at different Challenge Ratings to increase their utility for multiple gamers.  In addition, this allows player characters (PCs) to encounter one of these groups early in a campaign and then again after both teams have gained experience with minimal extra work for the Game Master!<br/><br/>If the entire team is unsuitable for inclusion in the campaign at the time, then NPC stat blocks can be used individually as needed.  A mixed approach can also be interesting.  By introducing a single foe into the campaign, this product gives a number of friends or allies that foe could call upon after running afoul of the PCs!  This gives the Game Master a ready-made answer to who would the NPC go to for assistance, or even who would come to avenge his death at the hands of the PC party!<br/><br/>Using This Product<br/><br/>This product presents the overall history of the NPC team as well as the backstory for each individual member of the gang.<br/><br/>Each NPC has four stat blocks (CR 4, CR 9, CR 14, and CR 19) demonstrating his progression and growth over time.  As a visual indicator, the color of the name bar designates which stat blocks from each NPC are of equivalent Challenge Rating along with the CR text.<br/><br/>Composition<br/><br/>Each gang is comprised of multiple members which can include a mixture of races, class levels, and templates.  This section helps the Game Master compare different gangs&rsquo; capabilities and make-up at a glance without having to review each stat block.<br/><br/>Team Members<br/><br/>    Ingerd Dwarfbiter &ndash; CE female thicken ogre<br/>    Muzzug Dwarfbiter &ndash; CE female troggle<br/>    Rumblegut Dwarfbiter &ndash; CE male stoneblood giantkin ogre<br/>    Runt Dwarfbiter &ndash; CE male ogrekin orc<br/>    Skarrok Dwarfbiter &ndash; CE male thicken ogre<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Team Summary<br/><br/>Composed of ogres and half-ogres, this gang is very melee-capable even with the shaman and sorcerer members due to the sheer size and strength advantage of the races.  The group layers rogue and slayer abilities to further the melee devastation.  The addition of a rock-throwing ranged specialist and earth elemental sorcerer makes them a threat at any distance.  The team rounds out with a powerful battle shaman capable of enhancing combat abilities and healing injuries.<br/><br/>The group has several advantages designed to fight against dwarves specifically; however, many of these are easily tailored to any other race.

In ASTROKILL, you will engage in combat against enemy fighters, capital ships, turrets, and even space mines. To succeed in this unforgiving zero-G battlefield, you must master your ship and its weapons. You will blow away spaceships with machine guns, flak cannons, and homing missiles. Your Gravity Shield will protect you from enemy fire and even turn their weapons against them.<br/><br/>Campaign and Survival mode<br/>Pick a faction and enter the fray in either a story-driven Campaign mode or an arcade-style Survival mode. In Campaign mode, you will fly missions within the context of a faction-specific storyline. With each passing mission, you will discover new enivornments, characters, ships, and challenges that test your skills as a fighter pilot. If stories aren't your thing and you just want an endless blood bath, then there is Survival mode. Like an old-school arcade game, you must fight and survive wave after wave of progressively more difficult enemies. Fight to beat your own top score or attempt to dethrone the number one player on the Steam leaderboards.<br/><br/>Weapons<br/>In ASTROKILL, battles are fought with conventional weapons, like belt-driven machine guns, proximity-based flak cannons, and Javelin-style guided missiles. When it comes to inflicting damage downrange, nothing is quite as effective as high-velocity metal slugs. The kinetic energy behind a 30mm bullet travelling at 600m/s is tremendous (about 68,000 Joules). If that's not enough, flak cannons fire explosive projectiles that detonate near enemy fighters, doing area damage. Homing missiles track fighters and attempt to intercept them and detonate within their kill radius. If a missile misses its intended target, it will reassess the battlefield and track a new target.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "197292": {"rpgdesigner": ["7.7", "Beno\u00eet Attinost", "Ga\u00ebtan Bothorel", "Gerald Brom", "Olivier Collin", "Mich\u00e4el Croitoriu", "Romain d'Huissier", "Sandy Julien", "Philippe Lecomte", "C\u00e9dric Magot", "Ingrid Mechin", "Rapha\u00ebl Mournat", "Ga\u00ebl Oizel", "Thomas Paccalet", "Cyril Pasteau", "Geoffrey Picard", "Ga\u00ebl Richard", "Anne Rouvin", "Monsieur Salade", "Johan Scipion", "L\u00e9onidas Vesperini", "Pierre-Alexandre Vigor"], "statistics": [], "name": "Backstab (Issue 33 - Sep 2001)", "rpgartist": ["David Bauwens", "Bertrand B\u00e8s", "Benjamin Fracasso", "Gr\u00e9gory Geng", "Denis Grrr", "John Kovalic", "Thierry Masson", "Laurent Miny", "Anne Rouvin", "Christophe Swal", "Stephane Tanguay"], "rpgproducer": ["Beno\u00eet Attinost", "Bertrand B\u00e8s", "C\u00e9dric Magot", "Rapha\u00ebl Mournat", "Cyril Pasteau", "Patrick Renault"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2962135.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Backstab"], "rpg": ["Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)", "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)", "Dungeons & Dragons (3rd Edition)", "Obsidian: The Age of Judgement", "Star Wars (WEG Original Edition)", "Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (1st Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["FC Publications"], "rpgissueversion": ["Standard Edition"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2962135_t.jpg", "description": "Backstab<br/>Nombre 33<br/>Septembre 2001<br/><br/>Nouveau: Cahier d20!<br/>32 pages de sc&eacute;narios et d'aides de jeu pour D&amp;D3<br/><br/>"}, "197293": {"rpgdesigner": ["Blackie Carbon"], "rpgitemversion": ["Fanzine print version", "PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Randomiser-o-Rama", "rpgartist": ["Blackie Carbon"], "rpgproducer": ["Blackie Carbon"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2963076.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Cloudstepping Media"], "rpg": ["Swords & Wizardry"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2963076_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>A quick new zine-sized thing for fantasy RPGs, a collection of random tables, system agnostic, from history, myth and my own gameworld, stuffed with ideas to spur your own creativity. 24 pages plus cover, featuring:<br/>- How to protect your town;<br/>- Just what did kill all the villagers?<br/>- Places worth exploring;<br/>- Contents of a wizard's knapsack;<br/>- What has it got in its pocketses, eh?<br/>- Snakes, why'd it have to be snakes?<br/>- Protective amulets;<br/>- Things to find on a blasted heath;<br/>- It's a workshop, but what kind of work?<br/>- Twenty pieces of hacksilver;<br/>- Oathsworn to vengeance;<br/>- Curious effects resulting from the consumption of various subterranean arthropods;<br/>- and last but not least, Inn Names Generator #652.<br/><br/>"}, "197294": {"rpgdesigner": ["Steve Robertson"], "rpgitemversion": ["Soft Cover Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Castle that Fell from the Sky", "rpgartist": ["Steve Robertson"], "rpgproducer": ["Steve Robertson"], "rpg": ["Swords & Six-Siders"], "usersrated": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Sword & Sorcery)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Vanquishing Leviathan LLC"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "average": "0", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>The Castle that Fell from the Sky is a classic fun-house tournament dungeon, combining hack-n-slash, tricks, traps, puzzles, and roleplay elements.

This is a game that is accessible to newcomers and advanced players alike and with detailed lists for abilities, monsters, magic, and items, there's plenty to give you ideas.<br/><br/>New to the 4th edition: Wow, forgive me for bragging, but I have really outdone myself with this update.

The list below is only a small sampling of the changes and improvements I&rsquo;ve made this game. If you haven't played my game yet, now is the best time to do it.<br/><br/>     I can&rsquo;t believe it took me so long to realize a major mistake I&rsquo;d made with the armor. You see, in previous editions, I had given PCs the option to wear armor made of leather and dragon hide. But as I was writing the fourth edition, it suddenly occurred to me that ponies, who are vegetarians, probably would object to the idea of wearing leather. Oops! I derped. So I&rsquo;ve redesigned padded armor so that it supersedes leather armor, I&rsquo;ve deleted dragon hide armor from the list, and readjusted the stats of all the other armor to compensate. <br/>     For ranged weapons and spells &ldquo;5 feet per Agility/Mentation&rdquo; used to be the standard range. Now, almost all ranged weapons and spells have a range of &ldquo;10 feet per Agility/Mentation.&rdquo;<br/>     The Telekinetic Spear feat has been deleted. New feats have been put in such as Telekinetic Crush, Magical Energy Beams, and Magical Energy Rays to replace it.<br/>     Characters from Daring Do&rsquo;s adventures (including Ahuizotl, his henchmen cats, Talicon warriors, and Daring Do) have been removed from Alternate Version Characters and have been placed in the actual list of canon characters in this book<br/>     The Talk to Animals feat has been deleted. If a PC wants to be able to talk to animals, they must learn the Faunal language by obtaining a level in the Linguistics skill. The Magic Surge feat has been deleted and replaced with the Quicken Spell.<br/>     For those of you who want to play as a thief or as a bard, I&rsquo;ve made some changes to feats essential to those classes. The Bard Songs feat has been edited so that bards no longer have to roll the dice just to successfully play a song. I also edited the instructions to the Sneak Attack feat and the Stealth skill so they&rsquo;re clearer. <br/>     Under character creation, starting skill points, Aptitude points, and HP has been rebalanced for alicorn level characters so it is fairer to adult and foal level characters.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "197305": {"rpgdesigner": ["Dave Bryant"], "rpgitemversion": ["A4 PDF, Revision 10 September 2014", "US Letter PDF, Revision 10 September 2014"], "statistics": [], "name": "Pony Tales (Revised)", "rpgartist": ["Dave Bryant"], "rpgproducer": ["Dave Bryant"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2963074.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["My Little Pony"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Animal (Anthropomorphic)", "Animation / Comics (Western Cartoon / Comic)", "Fantasy", "Modern (Pop Culture)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Catspaw DTP Services"], "rpg": ["Pony Tales (Open D6)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2963074_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Pony Tales is a role-playing game for ages twelve and older, written in a straightforward conversational style and streamlined for ease of play.

Where possible the rules make allowances for both kinds of games, offering suggestions and alternatives to suit the different styles of play.<br/><br/>The book is split into parts. Part one covers the basic rules of the game. Part two adds information and extra rules that are helpful but not absolutely or constantly necessary. Part three discusses the setting of the television program, both as the show&rsquo;s creator originally imagined it and as it&rsquo;s ended up in actual episodes. Part four offers suggestions and ideas for playing a fun and exciting game.

If the fantasy stories of Robert E. Howard, Fritz Lieber, Clark Ashton Smith, C.L. Moore, Karl Edward Wagner, and David Gemell are more to your taste that those of Tolkein or Eddings, this version of Microlite74 may be just what you are looking for. Microlite74 Swords &amp; Sorcery is based on Microlite74 Extended 3.0 but with many special rules designed for swords &amp; sorcery style campaigns. For example, there are only two classes (Adventurer and Sorcerer) and 6 levels, magic is limited and casting certain spells can corrupt the caster, and many 0e style magic items are relics of dead civilizations from long ago. Humans are assumed to dominate the world and most enemies are other humans and animals. True monsters certainly exist but they are assumed to be rare. Unlike most Microlite74 games which use a Microlite20-based experience system, this version uses a more standard experience point system.<br/><br/>The revised second edition of Microlite74 Swords &amp; Sorcery adds rules for allegiances (which replace alignments), expands the rules for corruption -- using black magic effects the world (e.g weather, chance of wandering monsters, etc.), adds a few new spells to the spell lists, adds rules for mounted combat, expands the section on adventuring (including adding a section on ocean exploration), adds demons and lovecraftian monsters, etc. Second Edition also adds a section of optional rules including several that have not been in any other versions Microlite74 (e.g. player-defined feats, rules for corrupt and/or tainted locations).<br/><br/>Microlite74 Swords &amp; Sorcery includes:<br/><br/>    Simple Character Creation Rules: Roll 4 attributes and select a class, a background, and allegiances.<br/>    Two Classes: Adventurer and Sorcerer, both limited to sixth level &ndash; but advancements continues even after reaching sixth level.<br/>    Backgrounds provide a simple and fast way to factor in a character's culture and non-class-related abilities.<br/>    Simple and fast-playing combat system that tracks physical damage (aka body points) separately from luck/skill/fatigue (aka hit point) damage.<br/>    Hit points recover with a night&rsquo;s rest. Spells cost hit points to cast. Actual wounds recover more slowly.<br/>    Spells are divided into white, grey, and black magic. Using black magic eventually corrupts the caster and has strange effects on reality. Only first and second level spells can normally be memorized and cast directly. Other spells must be cast with lengthy rituals.<br/>    Rules for hirelings, monster reactions (not every monster wants to fight), morale (not every monster fights to the death), and more.<br/>    A complete list of spells, monsters, and treasure.<br/>    Compatible with most other 0e based games and adventures.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This is the tablet/epub version of the second edition of Microlite74 Swords &amp; Sorcery. You receive two files: a standard pdf and an epub file. The digest-sized pdf is suitable for printing or for easy reading on a tablet as it is formatted in a single column and uses a large typeface.<br/><br/>The epub version of Microlite74 Swords &amp; Sorcery contains tables and many epub readers display tables in a single column unreadable mess. Epub reader software designed to display epub3 files usually have no problem with the tables. Calibre displays this epub file well on Windows PCs and Gitden reader displays it fine (if slowly) on android. There is an IOS version of Gitden Reader for Apple devices, but it has not been tested.

In that vein, we bring you the new Mission, UnCONventional Warfare, wherein the type of Shadowrun adventure often played in a convention setting is an adventure with a convention setting, because we hope reality will fold back in on itself enough times to usher in the Singularity.<br/><br/>Along with its bold setting, the Mission features a whole new look that in many ways may seem primitive but in other, more important ways is totally futuristic, because it has emojis all over the place, and nothing says hip, hot, and futuristic like emojis. Shadowrun line developer Jason Hardy said about this design choice: &ldquo;I love almost everything about Shadowrun&lsquo;s art and design, but there is one glaring flaw: an almost total lack of emojis. We need more emojis. More emojis! Emojis everywhere!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Shadowrun art director Brent Evans took the whole thing in stride. While the decision was made a little late to allow Mr. Evans to actually participate in the design, he noted his enthusiasm thusly: &ldquo;My head is swimming with the visual possibilities.  We could run amok with this.&rdquo; And run amok we shall!<br/><br/>Legendary design and layout guy Matt &ldquo;Wrath&rdquo; Heerdt was somewhat less sanguine, saying &ldquo;Oh nice, you drop an emoji project on me with no warning? And let me guess, production will have to develop those? Do you have any idea how swamped I am and how much time a smiling-winking-troll emoji would take to design? I&rsquo;ll shuffle some projects around, just don&rsquo;t expect the troll emojis to be twice as big as the elf emojis &hellip;&rdquo; At that point he shuffled off to hide under a warm blanket with his laptop and a huge carafe of coffee.<br/><br/>"}, "197373": {"poll": [], "name": "Be A Bard", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Storytelling"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["SkyTint Games"], "boardgameversion": ["Limited edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Humor", "Party Game"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "5", "description": "A party game for people who like to tell stories that make no sense.

In MSfB, each player has no idea who they are, but they DO know who all the other people are.

Suddenly you receive reports that a spy has gained information about your operation, and the enemy shifts their defensive forces. But do they know the full extent of your plans? Should you call off the invasion and plan for a new attack? Or risk disaster against a prepared enemy? This is the fog of war...<br/><br/>The Fog of War is a two-player grand strategic game covering the European theater of World War II from 1940 to 1944. One player plays the Axis forces, and the other the Allies.<br/><br/>The game does not have units that move around a map; instead the game focuses on the planning and intelligence aspects of the war. Each player has a deck of cards that represent the army, navy, and other assets of their nations. A map shows the 28 land and sea provinces over which the players are battling.<br/><br/>You defend a province by placing cards face down on the map. If you wish to attack a province, you must plan an &quot;operation&quot; to do so by creating one on your operation wheel. The wheel is a unique way of forcing players to commit to operations in advance, while giving opportunities for intelligence gathering and bluffing. An operation consists of a province card that shows the target of the operation, plus one or more cards to conduct the attack. All of these cards are placed face down, so your opponent does not know the target of the operation or the strength of the cards that are taking part. Each turn, the dial on the operation wheel is rotated by one position. This controls when an operation can be launched and any attack or defense bonuses that apply.<br/><br/>In addition to combat forces for attack or defense, you may also spend Intel tokens to look at your opponent&rsquo;s operations and defenses.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "7.72355", "name": "The Fog of War", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Simulation"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "112", "boardgamefamily": ["Stronghold Games: The Great Designer Series"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 019 \u2013 10 Reasons to Buy a Game", "Episode 36 :: Essen 2016 Preview + Stephanie Straw Interview", "RDTN Episode 107: The Fog of War interview with Geoff Engelstein and BGG Con Recap", "Strange Assembly 195 - The Stronghold of the Games", "The Game Pit: Episode 71 - Spiel \u201816 Council Chamber with Stephen Buonocore", "The Long View - Quick Looks #26", "What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing Week 74"]}, "197440": {"poll": [], "name": "Loading Human: Chapter 1", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American PlayStation 4 edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Untold Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 4"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Maximum Games Ltd."], "description": "Loading Human is an episodic, VR adventure game that blends a deep story, interactivity, and physical gameplay within a compelling sci-fi universe set in the 22nd century.<br/><br/>Chapter One is the foundation.

Each Raider has a model and a card with a unique ability which only that Raider may use. A Raider may take three actions during its turn from the following choices: Move, Search, or Showdown.

So while a player gets to take three actions only two of them can be the same type of action.<br/><br/><br/>     Move: The Raider may move to an adjacent train car.<br/>     Search: The Raider may reveal a Loot token and draw the number of Loot cards shown. A Raider may not Search if a Lawbot is on the same train car.<br/>     Showdown: The Raider gets into a shootout with Lawbots or opposing Raiders!<br/><br/><br/>At the beginning of a Raider's turn, a High Noon card is drawn.

There are 53 cards: four suits of 13 hounds (numbered 1 to 13 with a corresponding number of dog heads in circles) plus a single card with a red fox.<br/><br/>The red hounds are the trump suit. The fox is a red suit card, and beats any other red except the 10, 11, 12 or 13.<br/><br/>Players cut for deal, and the dealer passes out a number of cards based on the number of players, from 20 for two players to 6 when there are eight. After the deal, the rest of the deck is placed face down on the table and is known as the reserve pile.<br/><br/>The player to the left of the dealer plays a first card, which becomes the Trail card. Each other player must play a card of the same suit if possible, or any other card if he has none. The trick is taken by the highest card in the Trail suit unless overtaken by any red card, in which case the highest value red takes the trick.<br/><br/>The winner of the trick must discard one card from his hand and replace it with the one on top of the reserve pile. Once the reserve pile runs out, play continues until all cards in the hands have been exhausted.<br/><br/>All cards of 10 or higher in the trick, as well as all red cards, are placed in the &quot;kennel&quot; in front of the player and count for points.<br/><br/>The player holding the fox may play it at any time except as a Trail card. If the fox (which beats anything but 10-13 of red) wins the trick, that player gets five bonus points. If another player takes the trick with the fox by playing a high red, that players gets five points. If the Trail card is a red 10+, the fox must be played if held.<br/><br/>The fox is &quot;caught&quot; in the final count. Whichever player has the largest number of red hounds in his kennel (each card counting its number, i.e. the red 10 counts as 10 hounds, the red three as three) gets 10 points for catching the fox.<br/><br/>Each player then gets 4 points for each #13 card held, 3 for each #12, 2 for each #11 and 1 for each #10. This provides a maximum number of points available in a round as 55. This also is the number of points required to win the game, so a game usually consists of two or more rounds. <br/> The box also includes rules for six other games using the same cards: Chase, Dogon, Red Heads, Numbers, Word Building, and Finding a Sweetheart.<br/><br/>"}, "197462": {"poll": [], "name": "Rynn's Adventure: Trouble in the Enchanted Forest", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Animals"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Arcane Four Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Arcane Four Studios"], "description": "Rynn&rsquo;s Adventure is a 2D platformer game in which the player guides Rynn through a variety of environments teeming with magic and danger.

Great for kids and adults. Elementy provides this type of exhileration with a minimal game. The game&rsquo;s foundation is built around Rock-Paper-Scissors but the premise of the game eludes this mechanic with the cute, quirky, and almost comedic looking cards along with a few components to fortify this card game. Elementy is played over 1 game with a few rounds. Each player has a premade deck where they select cards from fire, water, or earth in order to beat their opponent. The twist is the wind which adds a few die and a couple Elementyrolles to come out victorious. At the end of the battle count your cards and come out victorious if you have more than your opponent.<br/><br/>How to play Elementy:<br/><br/>START THE GAME: Two players divide the deck in half taking three of each element cards (Flame, Leaf, &amp; Water) and two Wild Windy cards. Shuffle your deck not looking at the cards and place them face down. Next draw the top three cards to start the battle phase.<br/><br/>THE BATTLE: To start the battle both players choose one card (not showing anyone) and place it face down. Once both players cards are face down, flip the cards over to see who won the battle. Before battling again each player draws another card from the top of their deck so they have three cards total in their hand.<br/><br/>THE WILD CARD:  Wild Windy is extremely unpredictable. To stop her wrath the opposing player must roll a 5 or 6, if her opponent rolls a 5 or 6 they win the battle.<br/><br/>THE TIE: If 2 players put out the same card they must roll a dice, whoever rolls a larger number wins that round. This rule does not change with Wild Windy.<br/><br/>THE WIN: The player that wins the battle takes their card and their opponents card and places them in a discard pile face up. The game ends when there are no cards left. Whoever has the most cards in their discard pile wins the game.<br/><br/>"}, "197488": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jordan Brown", "Bill Bryg", "George Cole", "Margaret Gemignani", "Cary Martin", "Chris Pettus", "Niall Shapero", "Kay Shapero"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Lords of Chaos (Issue 9 - Jun 1979)", "rpgartist": ["Ken Pick"], "rpgproducer": ["Niall Shapero"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2966581.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["The Lords of Chaos"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Cover", "Curtain of Vapors", "Images from the Shadowland", "Magazines of Interest", "Miscellany", "Myriad Worlds", "News from Mania", "Operation: Chaos", "Runes in Space", "Runes in Space", "Snark Speaks", "Table of Contents"], "rpg": ["Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (1st Edition)", "Dungeons & Dragons (Original Edition)", "RuneQuest (1st & 2nd Editions)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["Standard Edition"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2966581_t.jpg", "description": "The Lords of Chaos<br/>Issue 9<br/>June 1979<br/><br/>Runes in Space<br/><br/>"}, "197489": {"rpgdesigner": ["Sheldon Linker", "Charlie Luce", "Cary Martin", "Steve Perrin", "Deanna Sue Ray", "Jason Ray", "Niall Shapero", "Kay Shapero", "Wayne Shaw"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Lords of Chaos (Issue 10 - Jan 1980)", "rpgartist": ["Deanna Sue Ray"], "rpgproducer": ["Niall Shapero"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2966584.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["The Lords of Chaos"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Beyond the Curtain of Vapors", "But I Thought This Was All a Dream", "Cover", "D&DQuest-44 with Warlock Inclusions", "Earth, Air, Fire, and So Forth", "Editorial", "Operation: Chaos", "Rambling Runequestions", "Runes In Space - Part II", "Superhero 44 Errata", "Table of Contents", "The Warp World Wizard's Drinking Song"], "rpg": ["Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (1st Edition)", "DragonQuest (1st Edition)", "RuneQuest (1st & 2nd Editions)", "Superhero 2044", "Tsimits & Tsuris"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["Standard Edition"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2966584_t.jpg", "description": "The Lords of Chaos<br/>Issue 10<br/>January 1980<br/><br/>Although this bears the cover date of January, it was not published until February, 1980.<br/><br/>"}, "197490": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Lords of Chaos (Issue 12/13 - Jul 1981)", "rpgdesigner": ["Mike Gunderloy", "Cary Martin", "John Sapienza", "Niall Shapero", "Kay Shapero"], "rpgproducer": ["Niall Shapero"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2966588.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["The Lords of Chaos"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Beyond the Curtain of Vapors", "Cover", "Editorial", "Golden Dragon (1 of 3)", "Golden Dragon (2 of 3)", "Golden Dragon (3 of 3)", "Runes in Space", "Runes in Space Character Sheets", "Table of Contents", "The Dismal Lich", "Update", "You Mean That's One of Ours?!?"], "rpg": ["Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (1st Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["Standard Edition"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2966588_t.jpg", "description": "The Lords of Chaos<br/>Double Issue 12 &amp; 13<br/>July 1981<br/><br/>Runes in Space<br/><br/>"}, "197491": {"rpgdesigner": ["Peter Cerrato", "Bob Frager", "David Frauenfelder", "Lee Gold", "Barry Gold", "Mike Gunderloy", "Tim Halle", "John Hartin", "Richard Hatschek", "Wes Ives", "Mike Kelly", "Cary J.
