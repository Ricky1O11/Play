Won't pay $30 for a set of rules for a less popular genre you might not play too often? Pay a smaller amount and get 4, 8 or even 12 genres covered in-depth. At only a couple bucks apiece it makes it a great deal to start gaming a wide variety of genres. You don't even have to risk the single dollar per genre because you will be able to play all of these before they are out. You can start with Scared Stiff right now!<br/><br/>Many games copy schlock horror movies but miss the point. Scared Stiff is unique because it models the INADVERTENCE of the art form's failure. Bad horror is not comedy with vampires and werewolves but poorly executed horror that is accidentally funny. The Scared Stiff RPG allows players to play real horror with a straight face and the game design handles the inevitability of inadvertent escapades for them. The innovative design makes the campy glory of b-movie cinema unavoidable but play is enhanced rather than forced by the style of the design.<br/><br/>The game is written in a light style that causes many people to laugh aloud at the humour every few pages. Even although play is &quot;serious&quot; games should be fun to read. Although played deadpan, too many gamers spend more time reading games on the way to their grandmother's cottage than playing them at their weekly picnics. A carefully modelled genre model boasts fun mechanics, a light style of writing makes for a fun read, a full colour cover, dozens of black &amp; white interior illustrations, 146 pages and no risk or guesswork before you buy it makes the Scared Stiff RPG a must have.<br/><br/>"}, "57354": {"rpgartist": ["Stephen A.

Contact with an opposing piece inflicts damage, but missiles, spells, and other special abilities can cause other effects. When all of the monsters of a room have been cleared, the heroes can move further into the catacomb. Items and equipment upgrades can be purchased from the Merchant with gold taken from fallen monsters. The Catacomb Lord is the final danger that the heroes must defeat to win the game; conversely, the Overseer wins if all of the heroes are defeated.

Again, all CR 7 monsters are right next to each other. Don't see one you like? Flip to the CR 5 monsters and pick two. We also include an alphabetical table of contents with a listing of creatures by type and subtype (also arranged by challenge rating), making Monster Geographica books easy to use from many different approaches.<br/><br/>"}, "57398": {"rpgartist": ["Matt Adelsperger", "Dana Andrews", "Dennis Kauth", "Hannibal King", "Robert Lazzaretti"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version", "Softcover version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Vortex of Madness and Other Planar Perils", "rpgdesigner": ["Jennifer Clarke-Wilkes", "Harold Johnson", "Chris Pramas"], "rpgproducer": ["Dawn Murin", "Ed Stark", "Nancy Walker"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic719426.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "average": "8", "rpgissuearticle": ["TSR Preview"], "rpg": ["Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Wizards of the Coast"], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic719426_t.jpg", "description": "From the Back of the Book:<br/>Have your AD&amp;D players been everywhere and slain everything?

The sculpture was turned into a photograph after being illuminated to bring out the three-dimensional aspects of the piece, and for an extra touch we tossed in some color on the dragon and the &quot;Dragon&quot; and had the colored part of the cover embossed.  Why purple?  Because a purple faerie dragon is the oldest and most powerful of its kind.

The answer is yes.  This guide to liches humanizes the evil monster that has traditionally been relegated to the lowest levels of dank, dark dungeons.<br/><br/>Necromancers pursue the path to lichdom for many reasons.  Some are truly evil with dark plans that will take centuries to complete.  But others are looking for nothing more than immortality.  The transformation to lichdom is shrouded in mystery and secrecy, and few who undertake the process fully understand all the implications.  Many are completely unaware that the enigmatic rituals that promise immortality may have sinister side effects.  Thus it is possible that some liches were once paladins pursuing a centuries-long plan of good, or researchers who only wanted a few more years to complete their studies.  Over time, the necromantic energies of the creation rituals corrupted them, and now they are evil liches... but the spark of humanity remains.<br/><br/>The Complete Guide to Liches introduces the concept of the redeemed lich, who has sloughed off his undead life of evil, and the philolich, a mortal lover reanimated by her lich companion to keep him company as he whiles away his centuries.  The &quot;typical&quot; lich is examined in detail, along with several new varieties, including the monstrously powerful drowlich and the time-challenged novalich (whose more limited creation rituals give him but one year to complete a specific task).<br/><br/>The Complete Guide to Liches is a stand-alone, world-neutral sourcebook covering everything you ever wanted to know about liches.  It is the seventh volume in the Complete Guide series.  Each Complete Guide is exactly what it sounds like: a complete guide to playing a given kind of monster.  As a GM, you'll learn how to run that monster, both in combat and role-playing situations.  The Complete Guide to Liches can be inserted easily into any fantasy setting.<br/><br/>"}, "57454": {"rpgartist": ["Samuel Araya", "Travis Ingram", "Ginger Kubic"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing", "PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Eden Studios Presents: Volume 1", "rpgdesigner": ["David F.

Record the name of the defender (whether it is a player character or a monster) in the box next to its armor class number. Likewise, you should record the name of the attacking character or creature in the box on the inner circle next to the letter code that represents that creature&rsquo;s character class and level or hit dice in the case of monsters.<br/><br/>In order to determine the number required for a character to hit a particular armor class, rotate that character&rsquo;s name on the inner circle to the armor class he is attempting to hit on the outer circle. Once the character and the target armor class are aligned, read the number inside the 'To-Hit' window. This is the number that the PC or monster needs to roll on a d20. The window directly below the 'To-hit' window indicates the number required to hit a character&rsquo;s particular type of shield - if he is using one.<br/><br/>The final feature on this side of the Combat Wheel is the Critical Hit Base Severity Level box, marked 'Base Severity Level'. When someone scores a critical hit, you can determine the base severity level by following the steps outlined in the Base Severity Level box.<br/><br/>Side 2 of the Combat Wheel game tool also contains data for saving throws for both items and creatures. In order to find the required saving throw number, rotate the wheel until the appropriate character class for the person making the saving throw and the applicable hazard requiring the saving throw are shown in the outermost window. The data for item saving throws can be retrieved in a similar manner.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "57016": {"rpgdesigner": ["David \"Zeb\" Cook", "Edward G.

The Numberland (Zahlenland) concept has been developed continuously since the 1950&rsquo;s &ndash; notably by one of the designers,Dr. Gerhard Friedrich. The basic idea for this game is taken from the German bestseller &ldquo;Komm mit ins Zahlenland&rdquo; (&ldquo;Come with me to Numberland&rdquo;) by Friedrich de Galg&oacute;czy. The game can be used for as preparation for school and as a learning companion during the first school year. The following mathematical concepts and skills are addressed in gameplay:<br/><br/>Cardinal number aspect (quantity aspect): Numbers are used to indicate the number or cardinality of the elements of a set (e.g. 6<br/>apples, 3 pine cones).<br/><br/>Ordinal number aspect (order aspect): Numbers are used to indicate position in an ordered set (e.g. first, third etc.).<br/><br/>Arithmetic aspect: Numbers indicate the result of an arithmetic operation, e.g. an addition (e.g. 5 = 3 + 2)<br/><br/>Geometric number aspect: Numbers are used to identify geometric shapes (e.g. pentagon, triangle).<br/><br/>Numeric image: Numbers are represented with the aid of numeral and dice images.<br/><br/>Gameplay: Numberland consists of 10 number houses, in each of which a number lives. Numberland has to be constructed correctly. But the number goblin, Jumble, is on his way from Mistake Forest to bring disorder to Numberland. Can the players stop him and build Numberland? Luckily they have the Number Fairy to help them. The players roll a die and if they roll a Numberland symbol they can construct on one of the buildings (which are completed in numerical order). If the players roll the Number Goblin their constrcutions will be mixed up and remain so until someone roll the Number Fairy, then the mix up can be corrected. Once all houses are finished we will see if Numberland is still jumbled or correct!<br/><br/>"}, "57061": {"rpgartist": ["David R.

You make the strategic decisions necessary to first locate the enemy fleet and then destroy it! Scramble your fighters and organize your Strike Groups for their deadly missions. Will they destroy the enemy and make it back? Your squadrons must contend not just with the enemy's anti-aircraft fire and fight vicious engagements with the enemy's CAP, but also navigate the wide and empty expanses of the ocean. Do the survivors have enough fuel for the return trip to your fleet? Or will they too be lost forever to the misfortunes of war?<br/><br/>The Fires of Midway explores in separate scenarios the four major carrier battles of 1942: Coral Sea, Midway Island, Eastern Solomons, and Santa Cruz. Also included is a campaign game linking them all together in which players must husband their resources not knowing which of these battles, if any, will yield the decisive result and turn the tide of war in their favor like the historical battle of Midway did.<br/><br/>The Coral Sea can be played in as little as 1 hr and up to 2.5 hrs for the Midway Battle.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/><br/>     200 playing cards<br/>     1 sheets of counters<br/>     1 large deck of 18 Carrier Cards <br/>     3 Play Mats<br/>     A 16 Page color Flight Manual (Core Rules) <br/>     A 24 Page Operations Manual (Advanced Rules)<br/>     Dice (2 different colors, D-6)<br/>     Box<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "name": "The Fires of Midway", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "average": "7.47549", "usersrated": "224", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Solitaire Games", "Solitaire Wargames", "War is Hell Series"]}, "57074": {"rpgartist": ["Jeff Easley", "Mark A.

Only a very tiny amount produces the narcotic effects that its addicts crave. It is taken in many different forms.

The Soldiers actively guard their  fields  against  intrusion  by  Scouts  from  other  colonies.  They  are terrifying  fighters,  especially  when  high  on  Wine  and  will  defend  their territory to the death.

The ratio of the higher and the lower number is then computed, and this ratio determines whether the side with the lower number stands fast, retires, is routed, or surrenders. Surrendering is the best result from the point of view of the victor, and occurs when the ratio is 2.5 to 1 or higher.<br/><br/>Grosstaktik is appropriate for re-enacting battles from the War of the League of Augsburg, the War of Spanish Succession, the War of Austrian Succession, the Seven Years' War, and the War of American Independence. The booklet includes short descriptions of each of these conflicts.<br/><br/>Note:  Publisher not list.  Game is listed on back page along with other games from Guidon Games.

It introduces players and GMs alike to the wildest, hippest neighborhood in Nexus: Angel City. Before it got ripped away from its own reality and plunked down into the middle of the reality melting pot, Angel City was a place called Los Angeles. Ten years later, after a series of devastating riots, waves of immigration from countless dimensions, and a period of frenzied rebuilding, it is a vibrant, crazy urban stew where the recognizable collides with the fantastic on a daily basis. The book is presented in the form of a popular lifestyle magazine published in Angel City. This format makes it ideal for GMs and players alike. See the neighborhood through the eyes of its residents:<br/><br/>- Check out a new archetype &mdash; the Hobbycop, a part-time vigilante who tries to bring order to a lawless town.<br/>- Cruise the Internex, Nexus' infinitely snarled version of the Information Highway.<br/>- Read about nine of Angel City's Neighborhood heroes.

The cards are available for purchase online, or at furry conventions, such as Anthrocon and Further Confusion.<br/><br/>In Furoticon, you play as an Owner of your harem, pitting your Furres (characters) against theirs, where they will use their wit and sexual prowess to break through the opposing harems and bring their owners to orgasm. The last Owner to remain without climax is the winner!<br/><br/>Each player in the game typically uses a 40-card deck, known as a Black Book. There is a shorter variant of the game where a 20-card deck is used, and each player starts with half Stamina Points (life).<br/><br/>The cards are meant to be traded amongst players and collectors. Decks can be customized and improved with cards that the player owns. Cards from any of the five sets can be used interchangeably.<br/><br/>One of the main purposes of Furoticon is to introduce players and collectors to artists that they may not have known about before. Artist credit, as well as a URL to their site, is found at the bottom of every card to encourage people to explore the artists of Furoticon.<br/><br/>Harem members move from the Owners' Haven to the Scene, where the players can then enter Bed with their furres, and attempt to climax the other furres. Each card has a number of traits that affect gameplay, including Gender, Species, Pleasure Experience, Skills, and more. In addition to Furre cards, there are also Treats and Actions, which act as items and instant effects in the game to add a bit more depth and strategy.<br/><br/>There are five sets so far, each with its own theme:<br/><br/><br/>     Vanilla: Also known as &quot;1st Vanilla&quot;, the Vanilla set was the original Furoticon set to be produced. With 179 playable cards, it provided the foundation upon which the rest of the game was built. There was no overall theme with this set, focusing instead on developing strategies and gender characteristics, as well as providing appealing artwork. 1st Vanilla boosters are no longer available on the Furoticon store, but the original Herm and Otherkin starters are still available for purchase.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Triskelion: Triskelion is Furoticon's premier BDSM set, focusing on masters and slaves, and bondage and pain play. Gameplay heavily focuses on adding &quot;pain counters&quot; to furres, which alter the Pleasure Experience (attack) values in either a positive or negative manner. Additionally, Alteration treats are prominant in this set, providing boosts to the Furres they're attached to, symbolizing bondage gear. Triskelion boosters are no longer available for purchase, but the two Starters (Male/Herm and Female/Otherkin) still are available on their website.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Second Vanilla: Second Vanilla focuses on college life, and showing the life and sexual adventures of such characters as Boy Toy and Lily Tyla. The set has no real gimmick, instead focusing on expanding the underlying foundation of the game. Second Vanilla boosters are running very low (as of December 8, 2013), and will soon be out of stock. There were no Second Vanilla starter decks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Tribes of Tanglebrook: Tribes of Tanglebrook focused on a Tribal setting, with transformation and tribal markings being the prominent theme. Each Tribe in the set has a specific gameplay focus, from Wolves and their ability to intimidate furres from entering bed, to Dragons and their slow, but extremely powerful abilities. Tribes of Tanglebrook is still available in the Furoticon store, both with Boosters and with the three Starter Decks (Otters, Wolves, and Dragons).<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Third Vanilla: Strawberry:  Third Vanilla: Strawberry (Or just &quot;Strawberry&quot;) continues the college setting introduced in Second Vanilla. This set introduced Owners with special stats that alter the core rules of the game. The set did not introduce many new mechanics, instead focusing on developing the group play dynamic of the game further, and making the game easier for beginners to get into. Boosters for this set include 15 cards instead of the previous 10, and while there are no starter decks, there are two &quot;starter boxes&quot;, which come with four &quot;mini-decks&quot;, made up of 20 cards each, and designed to be used out of the box with up to 3 other players.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Di'Ahla's Awakening: Di'Ahla's Awakening is the second BDSM themed set in the Furoticon lineup. Apparently taking place before and after the events of &quot;Triskelion&quot;, It serves as an addition to the gameplay elements introduced there. Pain counters and the &quot;Masochist&quot; and &quot;Sadist&quot; abilities reign dominant in this edition just as in &quot;Triskelion&quot;. Overall simply an expansion to the overall theme and gameplay alterations made by &quot;Triskelion&quot;. There is also a BDSM Starter Set for sale which includes both of the two-player deckboxes from the &quot;Di'Ahla's Awakening&quot; edition as well as two starter decks from the &quot;Triskelion&quot; edition.<br/><br/><br/>There is another set planned to be released by July 2014:Fortune at Vell's End.<br/><br/>Gameplay is similar to XXXenophile.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Di'Ahla's Awakening", "First Edition", "Second Vanilla", "Strawberry", "Tribes of Tanglebrook", "Triskelion"], "name": "Furoticon", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Worker Placement"], "average": "6.80909", "usersrated": "11", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Customizable Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["CCGs (Collectible Card Games)"]}, "57136": {"rpgdesigner": ["John Baichtal", "Paul Hamilton Beattie, Jr.", "Jeff Crook", "Lisa Doyle", "Jason Kuhl", "Christopher Perkins"], "statistics": [], "name": "Dungeon (Issue 65 - Nov 1997)", "rpgartist": ["Stephen A.

During their reign, two daughters of the House of Gonzaga married Holy Roman Emperors. In Gonzaga, players must get into the expansionist spirit of the times and build fiefdoms across Europe to stake a claim on harbors and cities, while also trying to complete secret missions. The game lasts 7-12 rounds, and players are competing in some of six regions in Europe. (The number of regions and the specific regions vary based on the number of players and the scenario tile drawn at the start of the game.)<br/><br/>A round starts with each player drawing a fief card from their individual deck; each fief card depicts one of twelve fiefs: plastic components comprising multiple hexagonal loops with castles on some of these loops. Each player then secretly chooses both a region card and an action card, then reveals them simultaneously. Part of the fief (but not all of it) must lie in the chosen region, and the action card determines whether a player must play the fief on one or more harbors, on one or more cities, on open land, or on both harbors and cities. With this last action &ndash; the alliance card &ndash; a player can alternatively place one or two of six individual rings on the board, even on spaces that another player has already claimed with a fief. You score points for covering cities and harbors, for connecting at least three harbors in a sea, and for setting aside your fief as a donation to the church. The cards you play are set aside for the next turn, thereby forcing you to switch regions and actions as you place fiefs.<br/><br/>The game ends either after twelve rounds or after a trigger point based on the cities and harbors not covered. The player with the most connected fiefs, including the individual rings, scores a bonus, then players reveal their hidden objectives and score based on the number of target cities they covered.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Abacus German Edition", "First edition"], "name": "Gonzaga", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Hand Management", "Route/Network Building", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Tile Placement"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "752", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games", "Strategy Games"], "average": "6.6084"}, "57164": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Rafael Hernandez"], "average": "5.375", "poll": [], "name": "IV-V-I", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Pattern Building", "Pattern Recognition"], "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "8", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic565624_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Rafael Hernandez"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Musicteachertools.com"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic565624.jpg", "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Card Game", "Educational", "Music"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "From the box: &quot;IV-V-I is a game where harmony and music form the backdrop for composing phrases in order to score points and win.&nbsp; But watch out!&nbsp; Twists and turns await in the form of part writing errors and styles that change the game entirely.&nbsp; With its unique and intuitive method of play, anyone can jump in and join the fun - regardless of musical training!&quot;<br/><br/>In IV-V-I ('four-five-one') players take turns using the cards to create harmonic phrases, laying down up to three harmony cards and two voice leading cards per turn.&nbsp; They can also play part writing errors on their opponents to hinder their progress.&nbsp; Errors that are not corrected mean the relevant cards are not scored, and in some cases reduce a player's score!&nbsp;&nbsp;Composer cards allow players to break the rules to a point, but if the composer is taken out of play, what cards had been played that break the rules no longer can be counted toward a player's score. &nbsp;When a player is ready to score, he locks his phrase during his turn by playing a cadence card (cadences are ends of musical phrases) and scores his progression (point values are listed on each card) up to the cadence.&nbsp; He then clears his tableau and will start a new phrase on his next turn.&nbsp;&nbsp;When a player has finished playing cards during a turn, he will refresh his hand and game play passes to the next player. &nbsp;Players pre-determine a stopping point score-wise, with the first player attaining that score declared the winner.<br/><br/>"}, "57165": {"rpgartist": ["Peter Bergting", "David Day", "Frank Frazetta", "Craig S.

Timeline cards can also affect combat. There are two types of dice - green and red - and they vary in their effectiveness in scoring a hit. Green dice are used by herbivores and red by carnivores.<br/><br/>Play consists of combats between pairs of players. During combat players take the appropriate number of combat dice, which vary according to a few simple conditions, and start rolling. The aim is to score hits against the opposing dinosaur. Jurassic Wars features an interesting game mechanism where the combat dice also serve as the number of hit points that each dinosaur can sustain in combat. After a series of rolls, one player will be left with no dice to throw and his or her dinosaur is defeated. With every combat, another dinosaur is removed from play. As the game progresses some players will lose all their dinocards and be eliminated until only one player is left standing and is the winner.<br/><br/>The simple, probability-based game mechanism is flexible allowing for basic game parameters to be changed and also lending itself to many different variations, such as Jurassic Wars Whist, a points scoring game that involves greater skill and judgement, and Jurassic Wars Casino, a Craps-style gambling game.

IMPORTANT - If you are RIGHT handed, use your LEFT hand - and if you are LEFT handed, use your RIGHT hand for the chopping hand.<br/>TO PLAY: 1) The &quot;Holder&quot; must announce &quot;Ready&quot; to begin the contest. After announcing &quot;Ready&quot;, the &quot;Holder&quot; may fake, pull the brick aside, or do anything to try to fool his opponent, the &quot;Chopper&quot;, into committing himself. He must always return the brick to the &quot;Ready&quot; position to give the &quot;Chopper&quot; a chance to strike again. After each point is made the &quot;Holder&quot; must announce &quot;Ready&quot; before a new strike can be made. 2) The &quot;Chopper&quot; MUST KEEP HIS HAND AGAINST HIS EAR UNTIL he is READY TO CHOP. He can fake - but must always keep his hand touching the ear during the fake. Once he has started a chop, taking his hand from his ear, he must CONTINUE the chop and try to hit the brick.<br/>TO SCORE: The &quot;CHOPPER&quot; scores one point if he strikes the brick. The &quot;HOLDER&quot; scores one point if the &quot;Chopper&quot; misses the brick.<br/>After every 5 tries the players change places.

They are a small people with a population of just about 19,000 who live near the Stanley Falls not far from Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Genya were fishermen and hunters.<br/><br/>Imbelece is only played by men as it symbolizes fertility and courtship. The Genya use the seeds of the Ngola tree (Pictantus makombo) to play the game. It seems to be related to Embeli and also to some Ethiopian mancala games such as Selus.<br/><br/>Imbelece was first described by the British ethnograph P. Townshend in 1977. Later another description was published by the American L. Russ which was inaccurate (like so many of his accounts).<br/><br/>There was an Imbelece tournament at the Regionale Schule, Niederzissen (Germany), on May 15, 2008, which was won by David Fischbach.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>Imbelece is played on a mancala board, which consists of three rows. The outer rows have six holes. The central row has four ordinary holes and a large one in the middle, which is a store. The smaller holes are called moseka (&quot;girls&quot;). A player controls the six holes in the outer row closest to him and the holes to his right of the central row. The store is used by both players.<br/><br/>At the beginning each girl contains three seeds called maana a moome (&quot;boys&quot;) or maana a leemba (&quot;male teenagers&quot;).<br/><br/>On his turn a player distributes the boys of one of his holes counter-clockwise into the following girls. This is called koenda (&quot;visiting the girls&quot;). After a player has dropped the last boy into the right-most girl of his outer row, he continues sowing by visiting his girl in the central row adjacent to the store, then the girl to the right, before he switches to the opponent's outer row.<br/><br/>If the last boy visits a girl, which contains boys, these boys including the visitor are distributed in another lap.<br/><br/>If the last boy makes a population of four boys in a girl of his opponent, this girl is &quot;closed&quot; by putting a leaf on it. The Genya call it kosongo moseka (&quot;marrying a girl&quot;) or koija moseka (&quot;killing a girl&quot;; in other words: turning a girl into a woman). For moseka, you can also say moakali (&quot;newlywed woman&quot;). Then the four boys are distributed in another lap.<br/><br/>Exception:<br/><br/>In the first half-move no girl can be married.<br/><br/>During sowing closed holes are skipped. If the wife was made from one of the player's girls, nothing happens. However, if she is on the opponent's side, a boy must be put into the store, before the sowing continues. This is known as ko-ongesa moakali moleli (&quot;providing food to the newlywed woman&quot; (while her husband is on a hunt)).<br/><br/>A move or a lap may never start from a closed hole nor the store.<br/><br/>The move ends, when the last boy falls into an empty girl or in a wife of the opponent's side (i.e. the store).<br/><br/>The player who could move last wins.<br/><br/>Draws and ties cannot occur.<br/><br/>Strategy<br/><br/>The girls in the lower right and upper left corners are known as ipaoko (&quot;respectable girls&quot;). A boy who marries such a girl in real life, will enhance his social prestige, a player who marries her in the game will have a big advantage.<br/><br/>"}, "57332": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic596345.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Wei-Cheng Cheng"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "3", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Formosa Force Games"], "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic596345_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Memory"], "description": "&quot;Taste Taiwan&quot; is a series of thick postcard game relevant to culture and geography in Taiwan.
