The spell has &ldquo;enthopic&rdquo; word in it, it creates a &ldquo;chaotic blast of multicolored hues&rdquo; - and yet it does not register as a chaotic spell. Any explanations based on this spell being a minor version of higher level &ldquo;prismatic&rdquo; spells do not seem to be feasible, since arcane spellcasters seem to have no access at all to this kind of magic, except for sorcerers with protean bloodline. So why gods of all alignments seem to be reconciled with this spell, so obviously using wild chaotic energies?<br/><br/>One simple answer is that most spellcasters are using a limited version of the spell, providing only the most obvious and unaligned concealment bonus. When a spellcaster chooses to delve abit deeper into the spell's energies, enthropic shield offers some new choices and uses. The most eminent of such uses is the spell's ability to end preliminarily in certain cases, releasing its energy to fuel some other chaotic effects.<br/><br/>This and much more is discussed in this issue of Spell Books!<br/><br/>"}, "204003": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Richard Borg"], "poll": [], "name": "Battle of Britain", "playingtime": "210", "minplayers": "2", "usersrated": "18", "yearpublished": "2017", "boardgameimplementation": ["Battle of Britain"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3097905_t.jpg", "average": "8.80556", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["PSC Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3097905.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "maxplaytime": "210", "boardgamecategory": ["World War II"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "Battle of Britain by Richard Borg, a remastering and upgrading of the classic, much loved old TSR classic.

Authors Neil Spicer and Jeff Provine proudly present:<br/><br/>    Spinser Zayne, auttaine fighter/gunslinger<br/>    Floreisley Avergreen, chlorvian sorcerer<br/>    Kanor Delfina, tretharri cleric of Nimsharu<br/>    Girrun Snik, zvarr rogue<br/>    Rhydis Kolmainsus, human bloodrager<br/>    Tialua Re'Duoth, elf oracle of life<br/>    Kato Njalembe, human psychic<br/>    and last but not least, the devious but brilliant Omik &quot;The Clever&quot; Jetruk, dwarf alchemist (chirurgeon)/gunslinger (musket master)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Built using the 20-point-buy method and with scaling notes for 15-point builds, these characters are not just piles of statistics.

The crunch for every character more than measures up to its incredible flavor text, though, and when it&rsquo;s time to throw down in combat none of these Planetary Heroes will be stepping to the sidelines.<br/><br/>Each character includes a detailed backstory, roleplaying tips, special equipment, and links to the published campaign, including a campaign trait selection from the Legendary Planet Adventure Path player&rsquo;s guide. Each also lists detailed level advancement information for their first few levels, with further suggestions for developing the character's long-term mechanical build.

The jagged spires of Maurer Estate jut up from the peaks, keeping silent watch over the isolated valley. Stoic and enduring, the people of Stensia huddle in their stone-crafted villages &mdash; Shadowgrange, Krezk, Lammas &mdash; built against the mountainsides. Wisps of thick fog twine amid the trunks of black pines in the Somberwald, thick bogs suck dead trees slowly down into their murky depths, and dusky pastureland provides scant sustenance to flocks of scrawny sheep. The lord of this bleak, remote part of Stensia&rsquo;s outland valleys is Strefan Maurer, who drank angel&rsquo;s blood alongside Edgar Markov and Olivia Voldaren centuries ago. His bloodline is small and mostly irrelevant to the larger world, but in the outland valleys of Stensia, he is the ultimate master. Avacyn and Sigarda offer scant hope to his grim subjects. Abandoned by their angels and hunted by vampires, all the Stensians can do is endure the unending dusk.<br/><br/>By the time Plane Shift: Zendikar saw the light of day, the game and story of Magic: The Gathering had moved on from Zendikar and started the tale of Shadows over Innistrad. I had already finished writing The Art of Magic: The Gathering &mdash; Innistrad, at the same time that Curse of Strahd, a horror-themed adventure for Dungeons &amp; Dragons, was on the shelves. All this meant that I turned my attention pretty quickly to the next installment, Plane Shift: Innistrad!<br/><br/>The starting point for this document was The Art of Magic: The Gathering &mdash; Innistrad. Consider that book to be a useful resource in creating your Innistrad campaign, but not strictly necessary. An abundance of lore about Innistrad can be found on the Magic website. This document is designed to help you turn the book&rsquo;s adventure hooks and story seeds into a resource for your campaign with a minimum of changes to the fifth edition D&amp;D rules.<br/><br/>This document also contains guidelines for adapting the Curse of Strahd adventure to set it in Innistrad. With a bit of creative improvisation, these tips should get you on your way.<br/><br/>"}, "204055": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3358873.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Michael Aldridge", "Russ Rupe", "M.

Agents assigned to the Warehouse risk their lives to retrieve these artifacts to keep them away from nefarious individuals who seek to use the artifacts for personal gain. In Warehouse 13: The Board Game, players take on the role of Warehouse Agents who must work together to retrieve these artifacts. But is everyone looking out for the Warehouse's interests, or might one of the Agents be secretly working for the Warehouse's most ruthless adversary?<br/><br/>Warehouse 13: The Board Game can be played by three to five players in about two hours. Each game of Warehouse 13: The Board Game is considered a Season, played over a series of Episodes. Each Episode will involve the investigation and retrieval of one artifact. Warehouse Agents must investigate clues, then use those clues to retrieve the artifact. However, one player is the Traitor, who secretly works for the Adversary. For every artifact that is lost, the Adversary becomes more powerful and thereby more difficult to defeat.<br/><br/>Each Episode begins with the Ping Phase, in which the artifact's location is revealed and clue dice are rolled. Clues are represented by 13 custom six-sided dice.<br/><br/>After the Ping Phase, the Investigation Phase begins. During the Adversary turn, the Adversary will act. Afterwards, each Agent may perform an Action, such as drawing Traits, playing a Trait, performing Warehouse Maintenance, or traveling to the Field. Next, each Agent must attempt to claim a clue die. If an Agent cannot claim a clue die, one must be neutralized, removing it from play for the remainder of that Episode. Finally, each Agent may draw a free Trait.<br/><br/>The Investigation Phase repeats until all of the clue dice are either claimed or neutralized, then the Retrieval Phase begins. Each artifact displays symbols that correspond to the symbols on the clue dice. During each round of the Retrieval Phase, the players secretly roll all of their clue dice and each player chooses one to apply to the artifact. The chosen dice are revealed simultaneously. The Adversary will intervene by rolling Goo dice which can neutralize clue dice. If enough clues are applied to match the artifact's symbols, the artifact is retrieved. If the Agents run out of clue dice before rolling enough symbols, the artifact is lost to the Adversary.<br/><br/>Play then continues to the next Episode. After three artifacts are retrieved, the Warehouse Agents win. However, if three artifacts are lost, the Finale begins, in which the Agents have one last chance to thwart the Adversary's grand scheme.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, the Traitor is hidden. The Traitor can impact the game by failing to assist the Warehouse Agents, by failing to claim clues, or by failing to apply clues properly. If the Agents believe they have determined who the Traitor is, they can vote to Bronze that player, which reveals their Loyalty.<br/><br/>Coming to Kickstarter, Q2 2017.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "8.25", "name": "Warehouse 13: The Board Game", "playingtime": "150", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Partnerships", "Role Playing", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "14", "usersrated": "12", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 025 \u2013 Gen Con 2016"]}, "204056": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Forrest-Pruzan Creative"], "poll": [], "name": "Jake and the Neverland Pirates Tricks and Traps Treasure Map Game", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3098552_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Cardinal"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3098552.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Deduction", "Dice", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Pirates"], "age": "4", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Play as Jake and his friends or Captain Hook and search for buried treasure!

Two players command opposing armies of miniatures and clash in a variety of scenarios. In a basic game, victory is achieved by routing the enemy army or destroying it entirely.<br/><br/>It differs from the normal tabletop wargaming format by using an action point system, where a number of points are assigned to the player at the beginning of the turn by a dice roll. These actions are then used to activate army units, which can then choose from a number of actions to perform. Basic actions include moving, shooting and charging, but most units have their own unique actions, such as 'Shieldwall', which affect how they are used in the game, and command units have access to actions that affect other units, such as 'Rally'.

On a turn, a player takes one of four actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Move their cat token across one of the neighboring blocks, then add the top card on that block to their hand.<br/>    Move their cat token across one of the neighboring blocks, then reveal the top card on that block, keeping it in front of them if it's a Cat or Item and discarding it otherwise.<br/>    Playing an Item or Action card for the effect described in the text, then taking the action shown on the bonus icon.<br/>    Revealing a card at random from their hand, keeping it in front of them if it's a Cat or Item and discarding it otherwise.<br/><br/><br/>Each Cat in front of you as well as each pair of Items with the same name is worth 1 point.

Status and position are very important. The Kingdom has been ruled by Ular IV for forty peaceful years, but is now facing a crisis of succession. The king has three children - the eldest his heir, has been carefully groomed to become King Elen III upon Ular&rsquo;s death. The second, his only daughter, as was the custom has been trained in priestly duties and was set to become head of the church on her thirtieth birthday. The youngest has been trained in the magical arts, and has been head of the collage of magic for the last three years. All these positions are normally held by the King&rsquo;s three eldest children. A week before the adventure begins, the King and all three children are wiped out in a freak sailing accident on a lake at the royal Summer retreat. Foul play is not suspected. Normally, in this case, the fourth in line to the throne (in this case, the king&rsquo;s eldest nephew) would be instated as heir and the queen would rule until her death. However, the queen is ill, and close to death. As soon as news of the tragedy reaches her, she summons the Lord Chamberlain to her bedside and tells him disturbing news. She says that some years before, after the birth of their first child, Ular had revealed to her that he had been unfaithful, and had fathered a son by another woman some years before. The queen was shocked, and refused to hear more, despite the king&rsquo;s willingness to confess. He managed to blurt out some details despite the queen&rsquo;s protestations. The matter never arose again between them. However, now it becomes important, since a bastard child would be next in line to the throne before the nephew. It is vital that this son, now probably in his early thirties be found or else war may ensue. The queen remembers few details about the nature of the affair since it was so long ago and so very repugnant to her that she pushed it from her memory.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>Adventure was designed for tournament play at Gaelcon '94.<br/><br/>"}, "204220": {"poll": [], "name": "WITCH-BOT MEGLILO", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Anime"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["ASTRO PORT"], "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["AGM PLAYISM"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Stop time and project yourself through space with &ldquo;Time-stop warp&rdquo; magic.<br/><br/>"}, "204221": {"poll": [], "name": "Ghost Sweeper", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["7 Raven Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["OtakuMaker.com"], "description": "Ghost Sweeper features fun stylized cartoon graphics and game-play that mixes action and puzzles, with a variety of items to help you along the way.

Why do you enjoy it?&quot; - Aaron<br/><br/>Great question Aaron,<br/>What makes Facility 342 different from what is out there?<br/>I created my game for a couple reasons.<br/><br/>First was because of the number of players current social deduction games can have. We found ourselves with 10-15 players (5-7 couple) quite often. The Resistance cannot be played with that many people. We could play Werewolf but I do not like how you eliminate players.<br/><br/>Second I wanted to add a new element to the social deduction game. Players loyalty can change during game play in Facility 342. What better scenario than body snatchers.<br/><br/>Lastly I wanted a social deduction game that had a role playing feel to it. In my game you have to physically leave the game table to go on a mission with another player. This allows things to happen in private that can affect the whole game. This also allows players to talk in private about their plans and they can use this time to figure out what is going on, or trick players without the interruptions of other players.<br/><br/>"}, "204242": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3100071.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Brooklyn Game Lab"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Vincent Dutrait"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Blue Orange (EU)", "Blue Orange Games"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3100071_t.png", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game"], "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>New York 1901: Goons of New York is a promotional expansion pack for New York 1901 that adds five new &quot;Boss&quot; cards that give special powers to the players who control each district on the game board.<br/><br/>Once all players in the game have reached the Silver Age, you look to see who controls the most territory of each color on the game board (with pink being excluded in two-player games).<br/><br/>Whoever controls the most of a color takes control of that boss, and at the start of each of your subsequent turns, you can use the &quot;goon power&quot; of one of your bosses to place a goon in a particular location, such as on a street or on a specific Bronze Age skyscraper.

A mythic virtue spell lasts for a full hour, and grants one of seven additional benefits, each based on a different virtue. A mythic wail of the banshee gives greater control over which creatures are affected, and can cause those it slays to rise as banshees on the following round, while a mythic weird forces creatures to save a second time on the following round in order to survive, and can permanently haunt the nightmares of creatures that die and are resurrected, and a mythic wind wall blocks creatures from being able to pass through it without making Strength or Fly checks.

(EA)", "GBH", "Gremlin Graphics (1983-1994)"], "description": "The first game in the series was released in 1990 for most popular contemporary 8-bit and 16-bit computer systems, the Amiga version being the most technically advanced. The game allowed the player to race a Lotus Esprit Turbo SE car through several (32 in the Amiga version) circuit race tracks of varying scenery. Two player simultaneous play (with split screen) was also provided, and a choice of audio tracks to accompany races.<br/><br/>Each track is lap-based and consists of turns of varying degrees, as well as hills and hollows which slow down or speed up the car passing through them. Each turn is indicated by a chain of road-side signs, and the difficulty of the turn is reflected by the number and density of these signs - a feature common to all titles in the Lotus series.<br/><br/>While racing, the players must manage their fuel supply, occasionally visiting the pit stop for refuelling. Also apart from overtaking the other cars, the racers must avoid various hazards and obstacles. These are dependent on the scenery the track is located in, and include slippery road on the winter courses, road blocks, slippery puddles and wooden logs.<br/><br/>The tracks are split into three race series, with different difficulty levels. In each race the player or players compete against 20 opponents. The goal is to finish each race on the highest possible position; if the player finishes a race within the first 10 places they qualify for the next race and receive points towards a final position on the high-score table. The names of the computer-controlled drivers are puns on the names of real-life racers of the time (&quot;Ayrton Sendup&quot;, &quot;Nijel Mainsail&quot; and &quot;Alain Phosphate&quot; for example).<br/><br/>Unusually, the player's starting position in each race is the exact opposite of the position reached at the end of the previous one. This gives weaker players a chance to improve by starting in a higher position.<br/><br/>When racing in the one-player mode, the bottom half of the screen is unused and features a static image of the Esprit Turbo. In the two-player mode one half is used by each player. The two-player feature operates similarly to the one-player mode, except that only one player needs to reach 10th place to qualify both players for the next race.<br/><br/>In the Amiga version entering MONSTER and SEVENTEEN as names of players 1 and 2 respectively, reveals a hidden mini-game - a simple space-themed shooter, where the objective is to survive as long as possible while shooting rocks that fly around.<br/><br/>Reception<br/>Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge was well received by the gaming press, which praised its feeling of speed, technical quality and two-player gameplay. The game in all its versions was rated around 80-90%. It was the only title in the series that was released for an 8-bit platform - the later ones were 16-bit only.<br/><br/>The ZX Spectrum version was voted number 17 in the Your Sinclair Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_%28series%29%23Lotus_Esprit_Turbo_Challenge Lotus (series)]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "204275": {"poll": [], "name": "KYUB", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["XBLA Xbox One Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Puzzle"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Ninja Egg"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Xbox One"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Ninja Egg"], "description": "Puzzle games are seeing a revival on consoles and Kyub is taking the lead!

The mission was postponed by the onset of World War IV, and as the war waged, much of what made the earth livable was decimated.  Civilization neared the brink of collapse, peace and stability became distant memory, and what resources did remain were quickly becoming unsuitable for sustaining life on earth.<br/><br/>The mission to build a settlement Mars was our last promising hope.<br/><br/>The Astronauts were recommissioned, this time covertly, and given only 10 weeks to prepare for the mission. Rusty from their lapse in training and limited by the global scarcity of resources, this group of elite astronauts remained the last hope for civilized life.<br/><br/>Surviving Mars: The First Mission, is a game about those first few astronauts and how they managed to create the first settlement on Mars almost a century ago.<br/><br/>In this game, players must work together to construct a predesigned and prefabricated habitat consisting of a biosphere, a sustainable crop system and a number research laboratories. Additionally, players must complete a number of critical life supporting research tasks in order to ready the habitation system and the Martian terrain for the first wave of humans.<br/><br/>The game can be played as a single experience, or series of episodes where player continue further the mission, and pick up where the last game left off.<br/><br/>This game is a cooperative (or solo) worker placement, dice rolling and deck building experience, that complement the push-your-luck feel of dice with the ever growing stability of deck building. Player cooperative choose teams of two astronauts (each with their won specialty) to complete missions over a series of episodes. Players take on the role of one of four characters; Biologist, Engineer, Researcher, or Commander. (An expansion is still in development that will allow a 5th character, the Medic.)<br/><br/>Each round players must cooperatively make both tactical and strategic decision with an overwhelming amount of unknowns.<br/><br/>Should we build our agricultural economy by constructing another Biosphere, planting crops, and/or harvest crops? Should we perform maintenance on the HAD and life support system, or? Should we perform research that may be give us key insights and could be critical to allowing us to complete all our other ongoing missions much more efficiently? Should we a rest, heal up, focus on the team morale and make sure our team is not on the brink of Psychosis. And many more.<br/><br/>This is a game that is meant to immerse the players into what it would feel like to be on a mission to settle Mars. The game is based upon the science and articles published by NASA, Space-X, Mars One, The Martian (the Novel by Andy Weir) and many years of personal interests and research into the topic of what it would take to settle and colonize Mars!<br/> A successful Martian settlement means, players must strategically balance a number of risks: the natural risks of the Martian terrain and extreme Martian temperatures; solar radiation and sandstorms; the immediately fatal risks of damage to their life support systems or habitat; and, or course, starvation. All this while still maintaining the state of mental and physical health necessary to construct the full habitat before the next wave of humans arrives!<br/><br/>Can you survive the first mission to Mars?<br/><br/>"}, "204288": {"poll": [], "name": "Old Mother Hubbard", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "1910", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3104013_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Milton Bradley"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3104013.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This is a Snap-style card game most notable for its fantastic graphics.

(Toire o Yogoshita nowa Dareda) in English means 'Who Soiled the Toilet?'<br/><br/>Who Soiled the Toilet? is a deduction game with hidden identities. The game box is 15cm round, not square. The game is published in Japanese with rules available in English, German and French.<br/><br/>At beginning of the game, each player is dealt one secret identity card, which is either a clean keeper or a soiler. They play five rounds. The soilers win the game if the toilet is soiled three times out of these five rounds. Otherwise the clean keepers win.<br/><br/>A round is either a regular round or an action round. In a regular round, a leader sends a certain number of players to the toilet in order. The toilet is initially clean (clean side of the toilet card is up), but when a soiler enters the toilet, that player may soil the toilet, secretly flipping the toilet card to dirty-side-up. After all designated players are done, The toilet card is revealed to all players. Soilers win the round if the toilet is dirty. Players should discuss and deduce who are the soilers.<br/><br/>In an action round, place the toilet bowl (the game box) on the table, and players take turns trying to throw a poo chip into the toilet bowl from two-card length away. The clean keepers win the round if a certain number of poo chips are in the toilet bowl. Otherwise the soilers win that round. Players should discuss who missed the throw intentionally.<br/><br/>It is recommended the toilet card be placed on an actual toilet because it adds more reality and laughter to players' conversation. To do so, keep the toilet clean, of course!<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>\u30c8\u30a4\u30ec\u3092\u7dba\u9e97\u306b\u4f7f\u3046\u5074\u3068\u6c5a\u3059\u5074\u306e\uff12\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u5206\u304b\u308c\u3066\u884c\u3046\u6b63\u4f53\u96a0\u533f\u7cfb\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3059\u3002\uff15\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u884c\u3044\uff13\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u52dd\u5229\u3057\u305f\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u52dd\u3061\u307e\u3059\u3002\u901a\u5e38\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u3067\u306f\u30ea\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u304c\u9078\u3093\u3060\u4eba\u7269\u304c\u9806\u756a\u306b\u30c8\u30a4\u30ec\u306b\u5411\u304b\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\u306b\u7686\u3067\u78ba\u8a8d\u3057\u3066\u3001\u3088\u308d\u308c\u3066\u3044\u305f\u5834\u5408\u306f\u8ab0\u304c\u30c8\u30a4\u30ec\u3092\u6c5a\u3057\u305f\u306e\u304b\u3092\u8b70\u8ad6\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002ACTION\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u3067\u306f\u5168\u54e1\u304c\u30a6\u30f3\u30b3\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u4fbf\u5668\u578b\u306e\u7bb1\u306b\u6295\u3052\u3066\u4e57\u305b\u307e\u3059\u3002\u5916\u308c\u305f\u3089\u30c8\u30a4\u30ec\u304c\u6c5a\u308c\u6c5a\u308c\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u308f\u3056\u3068\u6c5a\u3057\u305f\u306e\u304b\u5931\u6557\u3057\u305f\u304b\u3092\u8aad\u307f\u53d6\u3063\u3066\u8b70\u8ad6\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u5b9f\u969b\u306b\u30c8\u30a4\u30ec\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u904a\u3076\u3068\u3068\u3066\u3082\u76db\u308a\u4e0a\u304c\u308b\u697d\u3057\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3059\u3002\u3068\u3066\u3082\u7b11\u3048\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3059\u3002<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "5", "boardgameversion": ["Japanese first edition", "Multilingual first edition"], "name": "Toire o Yogoshita nowa Dareda?", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Partnerships"], "average": "6.48214", "usersrated": "28", "age": "13", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["19.

In the game of Kamozza, you are exporters and your goal is to load as much of your freight as possible into ships.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player has the same set of freight cards of various loads.<br/><br/>There are two docks on the table. Each round, two ships come into these docks. The one of these two ships has larger load capacity, and the other has smaller. Then each player secretly chooses a freight card from their hand and destination ship to load the freight. When they are revealed, count up the load for each ship. If the load exceeds the ship's capacity, the ship is sunk. Otherwise freight is successfully loaded and victory points are scored to the successful players.<br/><br/>After the fifth round, the highest scorer wins the game.<br/><br/>This game is simple but exciting, and its artwork is cute. You can play another game using the same cards. You should load your freight from heavier to lighter, but if you and other player play the same card, both cards cancel each other and you miss a chance to load. This game is also exciting.<br/><br/>The game was originally produced in 2012 in Japanese.

Shrines and monuments to these deities can be found littering the countryside, and many call to these gods for help in times of great needs, or hardship.<br/><br/>"}, "204459": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Artifacts & Legendary Items Volume II", "rpgdesigner": ["Morgan Szymanski"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3103831.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Blue Puma Productions"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3103831_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>Artifacts can be created by both the immortal, and the mortal, but often, it takes immense magical energy to create an artifact, and thus they only appear sparingly in the multiverse, and only very rarely are there more than one of them in existence.

Like the other corporate nation-states fleeing old earth, Japan used remote planetary surveys to target their colonization efforts. This planet seemed to be just what they were looking for; a paradise with abundant water, a comfortable climate and a vibrant biosphere. Once the colonists awoke from their decade-long cryofreeze, they found the planet was far less pleasant than planetary surveys indicated. It was a planet of extreme mountains, nearly boiling sea-level temperatures and harsh, corrosive tempests. The rain corroded most metal and unusual electromagnetic characteristics at sea level fried most electronics. The Colonial Board of Directors made the decision to settle on the cooler, dryer, and safer mountain peaks, with each corporation founding their own colony.<br/><br/>The planet was poor in metals, with the rain dissolving most of the natural ore deposits. Earth-born livestock couldn&rsquo;t survive and the only arable land was in the harsh lowlands. The scientists produced genetically engineered humans called henomin to labour for the colonies. These henomin were sent down to the lowlands to grow rice, extract protein from the seas, and grow iron-hard black bamboo.
