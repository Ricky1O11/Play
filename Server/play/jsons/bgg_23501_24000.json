The Japanese 23rd Infantry Regiment had captured several strategic positions on the crest of Hill 700, including seven pillboxes, and had moved light and heavy machine guns into the American trenches and pillboxes. Now the Japanese were in position to put fire on the American supply routes beyond the hill. The Japanese would have to be thrown off the hill &mdash; the only question was how. <br/>On the morning of March 9, the Buckeyes launched several scattered counterattacks with no results. At noon, the 145th Infantry made its first major effort, sending elements of two battalions up the hills with tank support. However, the tanks could not operate on the hill and the Buckeyes could only seize a few pillboxes. Air and artillery bombardment, including point blank fire,could not dislodge the Japanese. At 1700 on March 10, the two battalions attacked again, making some progress, but on March 11 the Japanese counterattacked, taking another pillbox at heavy expense. The 145th&rsquo;s commander, Colonel Whitcomb, was relieved for &ldquo;extreme battle fatigue&rdquo;. <br/> New Georgia Island, July 18, 1943.<br/>The American assault on New Georgia was spearheaded by the 43rd ID, with the Buckeyes of the 37th ID in reserve. The 43rd ID, as untried as the 37th, ran into difficulties in its drive towards Munda Airfield and began to fall apart. The 37th ID was committed in mid-July. However, in addition to stopping the American advance, Japanese General Noburo Sasaki sent infiltrating units to cut the Munda Trail, which served as the tenuous U.S. supply line from the far away beachhead.

Then a further five cards are dealt face-up to each player except the dealer, who receives his face-down. The first player begins by assembling his or her cards into one of the winning groupings described below, and displaying them. The next player must then create a more valuable grouping or fold. If the player is successful in creating a more valuable grouping, the original first player may try again to create an even more valuable grouping for themselves, or fold.

These planets are home to the Plonx and the Quirx, who both feel they are the better tribe. The more common galactic option to prove superiority, open warfare, has been abandoned. Instead both tribes go head to head in an annual contest, using their ability to manipulate the speed with which their tribe's planets turn around the suns. The tribe that is most skillful at manipulating the planets in such a way that it manages to establish contact between tribe-members on neighboring planets most often, wins the tournament and gains the brag rights for that year.<br/> This is a highly abstract space game for 2 players that is a slight step away for a designer that is better known as a safe pair of hands for decent children's and family games. Manfred Ludwig shows here he can be equally at home with challenging the more abstract gamer as within its simplicity lies an engaging little dice less strategy game that isn't spectacular, but works surprisingly well.<br/><br/>The board shows a large sun on each corner of a hexagonal, and a seventh sun right in the middle of it. Another 3 lines are drawn that divide the hexagonal in 6 equal pizza slices. Then 6 planets are placed at equal distance in circular orbits around each sun, in such a way that the planets closest to a foreign sun are directly facing a planet of that sun. These are the possible meeting points.<br/><br/>Each player get 5 contact chips and places one tribe planet around each sun on the prescribed starting places. Then, in turn, each player moves one own planet. When a player ends a move by making &quot;contact&quot; with another planet of the own tribe, that player  claims one contact-chip of the opponent. The first player to own all chips wins the tournament.<br/><br/>Movement follows a strict pattern. Each player can only move one (own) planet each turn. The first player moves a planet exactly one space clockwise, the other player gets to move two spaces. Then moves of three, four and five spaces follow, and when a player has moved five spaces, the whole sequence gets repeated, starting with one. Planets can overtake each other, but moves that would result in planets landing on each other are blocked and force a player to move one of the other planets instead. In the rare cases that a player cannot move any own planets, the opponent gets to move instead.<br/><br/>Publishing history: this abstract game appeared in the German game magazine P&ouml;ppel-Revue (1987/2 April-MAY) as that edition's &quot;Das Spiel im Heft&quot;. A pull-out board and rules were provided, players still needed to supply their own pieces (2x7 pawns and 10 contact-chips).<br/><br/>"}, "23589": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Chuck Foley"], "poll": [], "name": "Grab a Loop", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1968", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2602861_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Milton Bradley"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2602861.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Milton Bradley edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Humor", "Real-time"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "&ldquo;The Game that Really Grabs You&rdquo; -- &ldquo;You Loved Twister, Now Wait Till You Play Grab a Loop!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Contents: 6 belts, each holding one each of red, yellow, green, blue, white and black detachable loops; 6 'goal pads.'<br/><br/>To start, players stand in a circle with one foot on their goal pad.

The mapsheet remains the same (and is not included with the expansion kit), although terrain effects are changed.  The unit counters are more numerous, since brigades are the basic level of combat units, rather than divisions as in the basic game.<br/><br/>Changes to the basic rules include:<br/><br/><br/>     Artillery may only attack by means of bombardment and all artillery attacks are resolved separately from other combats.  All Artillery attacks are resolved before other (non-artillery) attacks.<br/>     Zones of Control are &quot;sticky&quot; (not &quot;rigid&quot; as in the basic game).<br/>     Stacking of units is allowed.<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["SPI Edition"], "name": "Napoleon at Waterloo Advanced Game Expansion Kit", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "6.28594", "boardgameexpansion": ["Napoleon at Waterloo"], "usersrated": "32", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "age": "10"}, "23642": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic213623.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Joseph Miranda"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2007", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamepublisher": ["Decision Games (I)"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic213623_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War I"], "description": "Publishers blurb: &quot;STORM OF STEEL is a complete simulation of World War One. The three maps cover Europe from the Pyrenees to the Urals, plus the Middle East. Fighting rages from St. Petersburg to Verdun to Baghdad and beyond. The maps can be combined for one grand game of the Great War, or they may be used separately for theater-level campaigns of the eastern front, the western front and the Middle East. The game rules use a modular approach, which allows players to employ the level of complexity they desire. Turns are quarterly, but players can use special campaign cards to provide additional move-fight impulses, recreating the intensive offensives of the war. There are scenarios for each year and each front of the war, as well as a grand game for the entire war. There is also a &quot;what if&quot; scenario for the war continuing into 1919.<br/><br/>Units represent land, naval and air forces. Ground forces are portrayed at corps level. Each corps is rated for the number of divisions it includes; so players can concentrate for the offensive or disperse for the defense. Corps include infantry, shock troops, mountain infantry and cavalry. There are also specialized armored car and tank brigades, as well as tank corps for 1919, plus the planned-for American airborne division. Each country has its own unique order of battle so, for example, the Austro-Hungarians have mountain corps, and there are also additional units representing Bolshevik and independent nationalist forces.<br/><br/>Naval units are at the squadron level for capital ships, and flotillas for cruisers and destroyers. There is also a complete submarine warfare module for attacks on merchant shipping. Air warfare is represented by strategic and tactical wings. A unique feature of the game is players can improve their aerial warfare capabilities by increasing their air doctrine level. As air doctrine improves, players can employ interception, aerial supply and aircraft carrier operations. On the subversive side, players can utilize agents to conduct propaganda and sabotage operations to undermine their foes from within.<br/><br/>Land combat uses three different combat results tables to model different tactics. Tank and shock troop units can use the much more effective Infiltration CRT. Naval combat requires opposing fleets to first acquire each other, then engage in gunnery. Lighter fleet units become invaluable for recon and screening, while battleships and battlecruiser squadrons close in for the kill. In the air, players can execute a variety of missions, including air superiority and bombardment.<br/><br/>An industrial production module gives players the capability to produce different types of forces. Production is tied to morale, and winning great battles will enhance your side's output while a disastrous defeat may lead to strikes on the home front. Storm of Steel uses a card system to generate major operations. Campaign cards give players additional move-fight impulses, combat bonuses and extra reinforcements. Players have to carefully choose which campaigns they will implement because some cards, such as the Schlieffen Plan, will provide for more maneuver, while others, such as Verdun, will enhance combat. There are also cards that will grant tactical innovations such as chemical warfare and armored doctrine, as well as bringing into play leaders such as Hindenburg, Brusilov and Lawrence of Arabia.&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "Storm of Steel", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Simulation"], "average": "6.14259", "boardgameexpansion": ["Storm of Steel: Expansion Kit"], "usersrated": "54", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "age": "12"}, "23643": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Ty Bomba"], "poll": [], "name": "Nine Navies War", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement"], "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "37", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic231001_t.jpg", "average": "6.59324", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Decision Games (I)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic231001.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Nautical", "Wargame", "World War I"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "Game of WWI alternate history naval conflict with battleships based in the seas around Europe, the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, using a derivation of the classic Avalon Hill &quot;War at Sea (second edition),&quot; &quot;Victory in the Pacific&quot; system.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>One 34x22 inch area-movement-map.<br/>Two counter sheets of 352 large-size ship units and 140 half-inch damage markers and other informational counters.<br/><br/>A three-turn &quot;1915&quot; scenario playable in one sitting and a longer 12-turn &quot;campaign game&quot; requiring about eight hours to play through.<br/><br/>"}, "23645": {"boardgamedesigner": ["David Mair"], "poll": [], "name": "Time Flies", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1995", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic126402_t.jpg", "average": "5.25", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["University Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic126402.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Players race to play cards that show their favorite activities.

It can only be played by 3 players exactly, and is, in essence, &quot;Nine Men's Morris&quot; for three.<br/><br/>Each player gets 9 playing pieces and play starts with placement of these pieces onto the board. Clockwise, each player places a piece onto a free space until all pieces are on the board. From then on, in each turn, a player must move one marble to an immediately neighboring empty space. When this result in one or more &quot;Triads&quot; (three uninterrupted marbles of that player's color in a straight line), then that player removes an unprotected marble from one opponent. Extending an existing Triad does not count as creating a new one. The first player who reduced both opponents to 2 marbles each, is the winner.<br/><br/>The designer has come up with a rules set that makes great use of the nature of a triangular grid, making Triapon a  much cleverer strategic game than a simple connect-3 on a triangle. A careful observer will notice that, besides the obvious Triad that is made on neighboring rows, there are two other straight lines along which Triads can be formed. If a &quot;short Triad&quot; uses 3 neighboring rows, a &quot;medium Triad&quot; uses holes that lay one row removed from each other, and a &quot;long Triad&quot; even has gaps of 2 rows between the marbles.<br/><br/>Pieces get taken first from the opponent who has the most marbles left on board, and only vulnerable marbles can be removed. These are pieces that don't form part of any Triad, are in a Triad that gets crossed by a longer Triad, or are part of an extended Triad, but, when removed, leave the other marbles still in a Triad.<br/><br/>And in the Nine Men's Morris tradition: when a player is reduced to just 3 pieces, that player gains the option to move a marble to any free space. The moment that a player has only 2 pieces left, that player is eliminated.<br/><br/>This is, in broad lines, how standard Triapon is played. An entertaining variation in which blocking marbles are brought back onto the board is also included.<br/><br/>Publishing history: released in 2 versions by the Swiss &quot;Murmel Spielwerkstatt und Verlag&quot; in 1999. The packing is as clever as the game itself: the board edges flap up to form a pyramid shaped box, neatly holding all the pieces. The deluxe board, or &quot;Triapon Classic&quot;, is made of 8-layer plywood and comes with 30 glass marbles  (10 in 3 colors) in a pouch. The cheaper version is made of cardboard, has a picture of a famous Swiss Alp printed on the outside, and is hence known as the &quot;Triapon Matterhorn&quot; edition.<br/><br/>"}, "23681": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic126896.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1984", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "6", "boardgamepublisher": ["Milton Bradley"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic126896_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Children's Game", "Novel-based", "Racing"], "description": "From the Box:<br/><br/>You and your opponents are in a dangerous race through the jungle.

Roberts Best Ancient to Napoleonic Era Board Wargame Nominee"], "description": "Spring, 1805<br/>Napoleon&rsquo;s Grande Armee&rsquo; is encamped along the shores of the English Channel. Following the teachings of Alexander, the French Emperor seeks to defeat a naval power from the land. He has but to place his 200,000 troops on British soil and France&rsquo;s hereditary enemy will finally fall. To do this, his combined fleet must control the Channel long enough for hundreds of shallow draft boats to ferry his troops to England. Standing in the Emperor&rsquo;s way is the Royal Navy.<br/><br/>The year 1805, which is punctuated by the British naval victory at Trafalgar, represents one of England&rsquo;s darkest times during the Napoleonic Wars. Her great &ldquo;wooden walls&rdquo; offer the island nation its only defense against a far superior foe.<br/><br/>1805: Sea of Glory examines the naval war on an operational level during that pivotal year. Although Trafalgar shines through history as the beacon of victory, it is the successful blockade of enemy ports that kept French boats from stepping onto British soil. But 1805: Sea of Glory is more than just a game about blockade duty. It is a game of breakout and pursuit, deception and false leads, husbanding meager resources, striking a blow where your enemy least suspects, and bringing about the decisive battle that defines victory or defeat.<br/><br/>1805: Sea of Glory focuses on the operational actions of the three great navies. The Allied player (France &amp; Spain) must constantly try to break out of numerous European ports and form a combined fleet. The British player must continuously worry about his ships on station, as wind and weather allow the enemy an opening to slip anchor and set sail. For when Napoleon&rsquo;s fleets take flight, the British are hard pressed to cover all the potential targets and bring the enemy to bear. The British player will find that he never has enough frigates to watch all avenues of escape, and that a clever French player can keep him guessing and ultimately win this game of cat and mouse.<br/><br/>The game uses blocks to represent the fog of war. The ability to spot and intercept your enemy is paramount. But is that block scurrying across the Mediterranean towards Egypt the French fleet? Or has the Toulon squadron turned west towards the Caribbean? From the French perspective, is the block off the coast of Brest a fleet? Or have the British returned home to repair and refit, leaving only a few frigates to watch the port? Is now the moment to sortie? Or does a large enemy force lay just over the horizon?<br/><br/>While blocks represent fleets, squadrons, and scouting frigates, traditional counters represent the individual ships of the line. Every ship that could have seen duty, from lowly 64 gunners to the massive Santissima Trinidad, is present. Individual ships are kept on off map organizational charts, so that the exact composition of a fleet or squadron block is not known to your opponent until interception takes place.<br/><br/>The great naval commanders of the age are present in the game as well. Rosily-Mesros, Villeneuve, Ganteaume, Missiessy, and Gravina for the Allied fleets. Cornwallis, Nelson, Calder, Collingwood, and Strachan for the British. Each admiral is rated for his ability to escape or pursue, as well as, his tactical acumen in combat. Special abilities are also included: from Cornwallis&rsquo; skill as an administrator, to Villeneuve&rsquo;s fatalistic bent, to Gravina&rsquo;s charisma, to Nelson&rsquo;s visionary brilliance brought to life as the &ldquo;Nelson Touch&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map covers the North Atlantic from the Channel Coast to Africa, and the Mediterranean from the Straits of Gibraltar to Egyptian shores. An insert map covers the West Indies. Each hex represents 50 nautical miles. An Atlantic transit track handles fleets and squadrons sailing from Europe to the Caribbean and back. The major ports of the three belligerents are shown; each rated for harbor facilities and their effect on a fleet&rsquo;s ability to sortie.<br/><br/>Weather also plays a huge part in the game. Storms and squalls will blow blockading forces off station, allowing the Allied player the opportunity to escape. While at sea, fleets and squadrons are at the mercy of the wind. True to any age of sail game, fleets may become becalmed at the worst possible moment. Prevailing winds are also noted on the map, resulting in interesting strategic options. A player that learns to anticipate and utilize the game&rsquo;s weather system will have the advantage. Beware being caught at sea in the Windward or Leeward Islands during hurricane season.<br/><br/>Each individual ship is rated for its firepower and morale. The Allied player will cringe as his Spanish ships strike their colors early in a battle, while the steadfast Jack Tars of the Royal Navy will never seem to falter. But despite their superiority at sea, the British are not invincible, and a shrewd French player will find ways to thwart his enemy. Fire high and disable the British so that you can slip away, or stand hull to hull and exchange broadsides?<br/><br/>A unique tactical combat system rewards fleets that seize the weather gauge. Each player has a selection of tactics chits which represent flag signals sent to his ships during battle. Choose the right combination of maneuver and sail settings to break the enemy line. Take the leeward position and attempt to escape before the windward fleet can close. Or from the leeward, turn and fight, creating a gauntlet of fire an overly aggressive enemy must endure. A Trafalgar sized battle can be fought out in less than 15 minutes.<br/><br/>Although the game ends immediately in a French victory if the Allied fleet ever controls the English Channel, there is also a set of variable victory conditions. The British Admiralty must watch out for French invasions of Egypt, Malta, Naples, Ireland, or West Indies islands. The British player will quickly learn that he never has enough ships to cover every potential threat.<br/><br/>A series of random events rounds out the simulation. Napoleon&rsquo;s meddling, British manpower shortages, West Indies fever, Spanish drafts, favorable winds, and Royalist spies are among some of the events that will hinder or help players achieve victory.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["GMT edition"], "average": "7.44975", "name": "1805: Sea of Glory", "playingtime": "480", "boardgamemechanic": ["Chit-Pull System", "Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Simulation"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "240", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Block wargames"]}, "23686": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic356504.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Nick Kellet"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2006", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": ["Scott E.

At the beginning of the game, players receive a mission card that tells them how much gold, silver and rum they will need to collect for the game. You keep this a secret from the other players. Successfully completing pirate challenges, searching for booty and attacking other pirate ships are the ways you can get the gold, silver and rum you  need to complete your mission and win the game.<br/>The game, based on the hit movie franchise Pirates of the Caribbean, incorporates clips from the films and takes players to recognizable places such as Tortuga Island and Rum Runners Island. However, this is not a movie trivia game. The movie only serves to enhance the action/adventure game play.<br/><br/>"}, "23695": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Ivan Moscovich"], "poll": [], "name": "Robot Face Race", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Recognition"], "yearpublished": "1984", "usersrated": "40", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2046132_t.jpg", "average": "5.76625", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Educational Insights", "Game Factory", "Spear's Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2046132.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English edition 2005", "English edition 2007", "Multilingual edition 2014", "Multilingual edition 2015"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Educational"], "age": "4", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "The game board in Robot Face Race contains 120 unique faces, each with four features.

You do not wish to fight an American Civil War battle and be forced to use concepts designed for the English Civil War, and we don't want to produce bland mechanics devoid of any period flavor or distinction. Polemos rulebooks now include The Great Northern War, English Civil War, and War of Spanish Succession, in addition to the new Napoleonic rules.<br/><br/>If ever there is an historical period that can lay claim to be THE classic subject for wargamers, then surely it must be those early years of the nineteenth century when Europe was gripped by the power of Napoleon Bonaparte, self-crowned Emperor of France and her conquered territories. A sublime hero to some, a tyrannical despot to others, Napoleon is a man who can still inspire great passions and emotions amongst his supporters and detractors alike.<br/><br/>The Emperor of France demonstrated his mastery of warfare in a period where the infantry were armed with smooth bore muzzle-loading muskets and the mounted arm could indulge in dashing charges with cold steel in hand. The armies were vast and the scale of the battles epic.<br/><br/>There was a great deal of variety in the size of Napoleonic battles. the French army that fought at Wagram was ten times the size of that which fought at Vimiero. It is a lot to ask of any single;e set of rules to cope with such diversity.<br/><br/>Polemos Napoleonic Wars is therefore produced as two sets of rules in one book. The first set, General De Division will allow the wargamer to fight battles with armies of up to corps size. The second set, Marechel de L'Empire will allow the wargamer to refight the BIG battles of the period, so he can emulate Bonaparte at Borodino, Wellington at Waterloo or Blucher at Leipzig.<br/><br/>The same wargames figures may be used in both sets of rules, as the basing system is universal; only the nominal scale will differ.<br/><br/>Polemos:Napoleonic Wars is aimed at enabling the wargamer to fight large scale actions; actual battles, rather than small scale skirmishes. Systems for firing, melee and morale are straightforward and easy to learn, but allow your troops to emulate the tactics used by their historical counterparts.<br/><br/>Basing and Representation<br/><br/>The basic unit of maneuver in Polemos Napoleonic is the Base - a group of wargames figures mounted permanently on a single base of a given size. The actual position of the figures on the base is not important, nor is it important that the base sizes given below are adhered to. So long as both armies use the same basing system, the rules should not be affected. The 'official' base size is<br/><br/>In General De Division<br/><br/>A base of infantry represents an infantry battalion - about 4-800 men.<br/><br/>A base of cavalry represents a regiment or two to three squadrons.<br/><br/>An artillery base represents a company or battery of 6 &ndash; 8 guns.<br/><br/>In Part Two &ndash; Marechal de l&rsquo;Empire, square bases are used. These can be formed by using two General de Brigade bases, butted up one behind the other.<br/><br/>Generals are placed on bases 30mm square. The higher the status of the general, the more aides, hangers-on, lackeys, etc he can have on his base.<br/><br/>Messengers may be depicted by a single mounted figure on a small base<br/><br/>All distances in Polemos games are expressed in Base Widths (BW) and Base Depths (BD) in order to allow the use of differing base sizes. A BD is half a BW.<br/><br/>This system means that any size can be used for bases, so no re-basing is required so long as both sides are consistent. We believe that a 60mm x 30mm base gives the best results in terms of both practical use and visual impact. All Baccus 6mm Polemos army and booster packs are organized on this basis.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition", "Second Edition"], "average": "6.85", "name": "Polemos Napoleonic (Marechal de L'Empire/General de Division)", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Dice Rolling"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "10", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Polemos"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Meeples &amp; Miniatures - Episode #31"]}, "23700": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jason Gorringe", "Simon Thomas"], "poll": [], "name": "Smoke on the Water", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Simulation", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "yearpublished": "1996", "usersrated": "7", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic165591_t.jpg", "average": "8", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Canis Publishing"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic165591.jpg", "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["American Civil War", "Nautical", "Wargame"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "This is a set of naval rules for the American Civil War for 1/600th scale miniatures.

All that cash led their leaders to seek the prestige symbols of the day: dreadnought battleships. Argentina, Brazil and Chile all built dreadnoughts just like the Great Powers, but none of them ever fired a shot at a foreign enemy.<br/><br/>Cone of Fire is a boxed game for both the Second World War at Sea and Great War at Sea series. The fleets of Argentina, Brazil and Chile plus those of Peru and Uruguay are added to both series, along with ships from Germany, France and Britain. Most of the scenarios, or game situations, are based on hypothetical situations arising from the actual war scares between the South American nations and sometimes European interlopers, and the war plans with which they addressed them.  There are also scenarios based on the actual conflicts which took place in South American waters: the hunt for Admiral Maximilian Graf von Spee's German cruiser squadron in 1914, and the hunt for the cruiser that bore his name 25 years later.<br/><br/>Alongside the ships actually operated by the South American naval powers, there are also ships they ordered and did not receive, or contemplated but did not order. The Brazilians have several projected classes of battleships that they never completed, as well as the modern warships they sought from the U.S. Navy during World War II. Argentina and Chile have their projected battleships, carriers and cruisers as well. And there are the actual jet aircraft flown by Argentina and Brazil.<br/><br/>There are six maps, three at Second World War at Sea scale, and three at Great War at Sea scale. These cover the region from south of Tierra del Fuego, the southernmost tip of the Americas, to well north of Rio de Janeiro. There are huge stretches of ocean as well as the narrow, winding channels of the Chilean coast.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "7.31585", "name": "Great War at Sea / Second World War at Sea: Cone of Fire", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Secret Unit Deployment"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["Great War at Sea: Confederate States Navy (Second Edition)", "Second World War at Sea: South American Navies", "Second World War at Sea: Strait of Magellan"], "usersrated": "41", "boardgameaccessory": ["Great War at Sea: Destroyers", "Second World War at Sea: Transports"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Great War at Sea", "Second World War at Sea"]}, "23734": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Play & Learn the Childcraft Quiz Game", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1976", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic127244_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Field Educational"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic127244.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Field Educational First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Trivia"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Play and Learn is a trivia game based on the Worldbook 'How &amp; Why' library of children's encyclopedias.<br/>Players move around a square board and depending where they land are required to take a volume of the World Book encyclopedias and then answer a question after being directed to the required page by the cards.<br/><br/>"}, "23735": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic127274.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bey"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2000", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Didier Bourgeois", "Christophe Camilotte"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Vae Victis"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic127274_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Age of Reason", "Wargame"], "description": "Suffren in India is a wargame (for 2 players) published in French magazine Vae Victis #34.<br/><br/>It is dedicated to the incredible naval campaign in India (1782-1783), where two equally able admirals fought each other: Hugues for the English side, Suffren for the French side.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Vae Victis magazine edition"], "average": "6.13333", "name": "Suffren aux Indes", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "15", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Age of Kings", "Magazine: Vae Victis"]}, "23736": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Missionary Conquest", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pick-up and Deliver"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "9", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic203626_t.jpg", "average": "3.63333", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Bible Games Co."], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic203626.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Humor", "Religious", "Transportation"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Each player is an American Christian missionary with the goal of visiting a number of countries on short-term mission trips.

You get all the great action of the game on the ice with NHL Ice Breaker. Game play is built around CSE Games' specially-designed 54-card playing deck (52 standard suited cards plus two Jokers). Each action in NHL Ice Breaker is based on the basic principle of high hand wins. Opponents play their card(s) at the same time to battle for puck possession, and the player with the highest hand gets to execute his/her action indicated on the card(s) played.<br/><br/>As players win hands, the puck is moved up the ice (game board) and toward the opponent's net. Along the way, players may land on special &ldquo;Ice Breaker&rdquo; squares, which can shift momentum in an instant. Ice Breaker actions include penalties, big hits, turnovers or great passes. Once in the Shooting Zone, it's a classic contest of shooter versus goalie. Did you play your cards right?<br/><br/>NHL Ice Breaker separates itself from other hockey-based games in that it has a true hockey 'feel'. The game is both accurate and fast-paced. Combining elements of popular card games, players must decide how best to play their cards. Cards can be played individually, in pairs, two pair, or three-of-a-kind.

Lavishly equipped and overconfident after its first successful performance in the fall of Malaga, the Italians thought they could quickly and easily end the war.  Spain was not Abyssinia, however, and Madrid was not Malaga.  The new People's Republican Army was no longer the rag-tag mix of militia units that had fought the Nationalists only a few months before.  The Italians were repulsed after a fierce campaign fought under very tough conditions.

Players deploy cards face down into their three battle line areas.  Player's hands act as the Reserve area.  Each turn, every unit may either move or fire.  Movement consists of advancing into the opponent's battle line areas to engage.  Combat consists of rolling dice equal to the unit's CV with hits occurring for each die that is less than or equal to the unit's firepower.  For each hit taken, a unit must make a morale check, rolling equal to or less than their CV or &quot;rout&quot; (i.e., be discarded).<br/><br/>Play continues until one side is able to occupy unopposed two of the three opponent's battle line areas.

It's the last surviving member of the 17th-century Verkehren/Revertier family of games, that mainly differ from Backgammon in forbidding the closing of the first eleven points - making it possible to win by &quot;locking out&quot; one's opponent, called jan in the Swedish terminology. Br&auml;dspel adds to Verkehren a third objective - arranging one's pieces in one of four preset patterns - and rules for hitting a closed point under special circumstances.<br/><br/>A Br&auml;dspel table was brought aboard the warship Vasa on her ill-fated maiden voyage in 1628. When the ship was salvaged in 1961, that board rekindled interest in the game, helping it survive where other Verkehren games died out. Today, the game is governed by the Swedish Tables Association of the Vasa Museum, which holds annual championships right next to old Vasa.<br/><br/>RULES: <br/>(Slight variants may exist. These rules are based on the (lengthier, complete) rules used in the Swedish Championships.)<br/><br/>The game consists of a board (similar to a backgammon board), 15 checkers (game pieces) each of two colours for a total of 30 pieces, and 2 regular dice.<br/>A full match is usually played as best out of a predetermined odd number of games. Winning a single game gives 1-4 points as described below.<br/><br/>The fields are called tongues and are numbered from 1-24 for each player, starting with 1 at the top right tongue as seen from the player, and going counterclockwise around the board with 24 in the lower right corner. Tongue number 1 is called  a player&rsquo;s &rdquo;home&rdquo; and number 12 is referred to as &quot;huk&quot;. Fields 1-6 constitute the first quarter, 7-12 the second, 13-18 the third, and 19-24 the fourth.<br/><br/>Preparations: Each player choses one color and places all his/her 15 checkers on his/her home tongue in the upper, right corner. The starting order for the first game is determined by rolling one die each after which the player with the lowest result goes first. In consecutive games the loser of the previous game starts.<br/><br/>Gameplay: <br/>The players take turns throwing the dice and (if possible) moving their pieces. The game pieces are moved counter-clockwise according to the dice. If a player is able to make a move it is obligatory to do so. If only one die can be used it is mandatory to do so. The player can choose to move the same piece for both dice or move a different piece for each die. If moving the same piece for both dice it is forbidden to add up the the numbers and land immediately on the field corresponding to the sum. The piece has to be moved first according to either of the dice and then according to the other. If both dice show the same number they are counted double, e.g. if two fives are thrown the player moves 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 steps and the player can distribute these four moves freely on 1-4 game pieces.<br/><br/>There must never be game pieces of opposite colors on the same tongue. A player may have no more than one game piece each on tongues nr 2-11, and once the home has been reduced to one game piece the same applies to that field. On tongues 12-24 the number of the player's own game pieces is unlimited. If a game piece lands on a tongue with a single opponent piece, that piece is &rdquo;beaten,&rdquo; meaning that it is temporarily taken out and has to re-enter the game by landing on a tongue in the first quarter that is either vacant or has a single piece of the opponent&rsquo;s colour. (See exception under blasting &ndash; b below) No other moves are allowed for a player with one or more beaten pieces until they are all back in play.<br/><br/>Two or more pieces of the same colour on a tongue are referred to as bands. A game piece may normally not land on one of the opponent's bands. (Exception explained under &rdquo;blasting&rdquo; a-b below.)<br/><br/>Blasting: <br/>Though it is not normally allowed to land on a field containing a band of the opposite colour there are two exceptions. Beating more than one piece at once like this is called blasting. <br/>a) If a player has bands on six or more consequtive fields the opponent may beat all the pieces on one of these fields by landing on it.<br/>b) If the opponent has bands in a player&rsquo;s first quarter and the player&rsquo;s only opportunity to get all his beaten pieces back into play is by landing on one or more of the opponent&rsquo;s bands he is allowed to do so, blasting the opponent&rsquo;s pieces.<br/>If a player has exited all pieces but one from the game it is no longer allowed to blast with that last piece.<br/><br/>Winning conditions:<br/>There are several different winning conditions (five if counted as below) plus the possibility for a player to surrender a game. A surrendered game gives one point to the winner. A player can surrender at any time as long as he has not yet formed any band in his third or fourth quarter. After doing so surrendering is no longer allowed, even if the band(s) has/have since been broken.<br/><br/>1. &quot;Home play&quot; Exiting the board with all 15 checkers. (1 point for winner)<br/>Once all of a player&rsquo;s pieces are in the fourth quarter he can start taking them out of the game by throwing at least the number required to reach an imaginary 25th tongue. (If a piece is beaten at this stage it has to re-enter and move all the way into the fourth quarter before any furher pieces of that colour can exit.)<br/><br/>2 &rdquo;Beautiful game&rdquo; (1 point for  winner)<br/>There are four different winning conditions referred to as &quot;beautiful game&quot; which are all obtained by arranging the game pieces in specific patterns in the fourth quarter. They all give one point to the winner. Both dice must be counted, i.e. a player can not win this way by only moving for one of the two numbers thrown. However, if a player can win through &rdquo;beautiful game&rdquo; by casting one die only he may chose to do so. In case of failiure he may only cast one die on each of his two following turns. The four variants of beautiful game are:<br/>2a. Three pieces each on tongues 20-24 <br/>2b. Five pieces each on tongues 22-24<br/>2c. Three pieces on tongue 22, five pieces on tonge 23, and seven pieces on tongue 24<br/>2d. All fifteen pieces on tongue 24.<br/><br/>3. &quot;Monk&quot; (2 points for winner)<br/>3a) &rdquo;Homeplay with monk&quot; Winning by homeplay while the opponent has at least one beaten checker not yet back into gameplay.<br/>3b) &quot;Beautiful game with monk&quot; Winning by beautiful game while the opponent has at least one beaten checker not yet back into gameplay.<br/><br/>4. &quot;Jan&quot; (2 points for winner)<br/>If a player beats more of the opponent&rsquo;s pieces than can possibly re-enter the game (due to a lack of available tongues in the first quarter) that player wins the game. This is called &rdquo;making the opponent Jan&rdquo;<br/><br/>5. &quot;Blast-Jan&quot; (4 points for winner) <br/>Making the opponent Jan by blasting a band.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Alga first edition", "Vasamuseet Edition 1996"], "name": "Svenskt br\u00e4dspel", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "average": "6.4", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Gammon"]}, "23833": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Talstafet", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2484617_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["danspil"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2484617.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Dice", "Math"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "The game consists of: 1 board, 1 red die, 1 blue die, 1 playing piece, 35 number tokens, 1 set of rules.

The purpose of the game is to knock the center pieces out with the hammer without causing the doll on top to fall over. The doll on top is called daruma; he represents the Buddhist priest Bodhidharma who is said to have lost the use of his arms and legs after meditating for nine years. Today daruma are used as a charm for the fulfillment of a special wish, for example, passing the entrance exam to high school or winning an election. The character written on this daruma\u0081s belly reads \u0081gfuku,\u0081h or good fortune. Japanese children can play with daruma otoshi when they are alone by seeing how many blocks they can knock out before daruma topples over.

Chaupar later became Parcheesi - aka Ludo - in the west. Invented by Akbar the Great, ruler of India, who lived from 1542 to 1605.<br/><br/>Think of it as 16 player Chaupar, with 16 arms instead of 4, and you are a long way there. The board is made out of 16 parallelograms arranged in a circle around a centre. Each parallelogram is divided in 24 fields, in 3 rows of 8. Each of the 16 players get 4 pawns each. Four (traditional) dice are used, with the longer sides marked 1,2,10 and 12. As in Chaupar, the pieces are moved anti-clockwise, and go around the whole circle. The first player out wins the agreed amount from all other 15, and each subsequent finisher also gets that same amount from whoever is still left to finish. So the last player loses the most.<br/><br/>His Majesty seemed to play 12 broad variations:<br/><br/>1. No pawn can remove another pawn, but it moves on by itself instead.<br/>2. Single pawns may be captured, and are sent back to start.<br/>3. With each throw two pawns are moved at a time (with or without the option to capture).<br/>4. Three or four pawns are moved like this.<br/>5. The dice are thrown four times, and four pawns are moved at each throw.<br/>   <br/>Usually players would all move in the same direction, but sometimes some players would move anti-clockwise, whilst other would play clockwise.<br/><br/>6. A player is out when he reaches the starting point of the player directly opposite, moving from the middle row of his opposite number into the empty centre space. Longer games would require players to reach the starting point of the player sitting on the left.<br/>7. Each player has three throws. On the first throw two own pawns are moved, on the second throw, the player moves one own pawn, and one pawn belonging to the player on the right. On the third throw, again, one own pawn gets moved, plus the player on the left may also move one pawn belonging to that player. Pawns belonging to neighbours cannot be removed, and when they land in the same row as a player's own pieces, they are moved as if they belonged to the throwing player.<br/>8. Two pawns together may hit two other pawns, but single pawns cannot hit each other.<br/>9. Four pawns combined can remove 3 pawns, 3 pawns can hit groups of 2, 2 can hit single pawns, but single pieces cannot remove any.<br/>10. A player whose turn it is moves according to the dice rolled, the player opposite him moves at the same time, but uses the eyes of the bottom side of the dice, whilst the players on the left and right also move, but according to the eyes on the left and right face of the rolled die.<br/>11. Five dice are rolled. The active player moves the sum of the two highest rolls. The next highest roll is used by the person on the opposite side of the board. The lowest two rolls are used by the players sitting on the left and right.<br/>12. Five dice and five pawns. At every throw, the result of one of the rolled dice is given to the player on the right. In a variation to this, the thrower would name four players before rolling, and would give one result to each of these players, keeping only the fifth die. And when only a few points are left to get pukhtah, the remaining points go to those near to where the dice come to rest.<br/><br/>If the game was played by less people the board and the number of dice thrown would be amended accordingly. It is highly likely the boards were frequently life-sized and groups of slave girls were sent around the track, dressed in appropriate colours.<br/><br/>Brief history: ask anyone to name great rulers of history and you are unlikely to hear the name Akbar, ruler of the Mughal Empire (1556-1605). Leaving remarkable military and administrative successes, and a fondness for alcohol and women to one side, the illiterate and, at times, brutal man, also had a passion for religious tolerance and class harmony. He surrounded himself with scholars, thinkers and poets, and was persuaded by the Plato school that argued that a great ruler should be like a philosopher-king. Whilst trying to unify the different religions, he became a great patron of the arts and literature, for which he is best remembered. Thanks to the recordings in the &quot;Ain I Akabari&quot;, third volume of the &quot;Akbarn\u0101ma&quot;, a detailed biography and history record kept by his close advisor and court scribe, Abu'l Fazl, we know that the good bloke also had a weak spot for games, and had even invented a game of his own. It is because of Abu'l Fazl passion for detail and accuracy that the rules of this elaborate Chaupar descendant have been preserved to this day, as part of a seperate chapter on Amusements.<br/><br/>"}, "23895": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "How to make a Million!", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "1988", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1099184_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["White Tiger"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1099184.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "From the game:<br/><br/>&quot;Sport, Business, Crime and Acting.

I was killed.&quot;<br/><br/>Thus read the last diary entry, found in the pocket of a dead Union soldier. He had made the entry himself, while all around him, other soldiers were writing names and home addresses on slips of paper and pinning them to the back of their coats.<br/><br/>These veteran soldiers knew what was coming, although it seems their commanders did not. Three full corps launched a disjointed attack against well-entrenched Confederates. In just eight minutes, the attack had petered out. Over 7000 Federals covered the Virginia soil. A few minutes later, the orders came down to renew the attacks, but at each level, from corps commander to captain, the orders were &quot;followed&quot; only by increased firing -- most of it blindly -- while remaining in position.<br/><br/>Grant said, &quot;I regret this assault more than any one I ever ordered.&quot; Today it sounds more like WWI madness than part of Grant's successful campaign to end the Civil War.<br/><br/>But it was not so easy on the other side. While one CSA staffer called it &quot;perhaps the easiest victory ever granted to Confederate arms by the folly of Federal commanders,&quot; from Lee's point of view, anything could happen. His army had &quot;not a regiment&quot; in reserve, and the volume of sound -- &quot;It seemed more like a volcanic blast than a battle,&quot; -- rattled windows all the way back in Richmond.<br/><br/>Not War But Murder covers the week-long operation which marked the end of Grant's 30 day, &quot;smash 'em up&quot; campaign begun at Wilderness. Like a bloody chess match, Grant and Lee made move and counter move to get to this point, with Lee well aware that a false move could end the war quickly.<br/><br/>Not War But Murder, by designer Michael Rinella, is his newest area-map game, and his first take on an American Civil War battle. This game includes one 22&quot; by 34&quot; inch area map, 176 5/8&quot; counters, and 16 pages of rules and charts that include extensive examples of play, designer notes, and variant rules. It also marks the debut of what Rinella calls the &quot;diceless advantage&quot;. In previous area-impulse games, from Monty's Gamble all the way to the Avalon Hill games of the early 1990s, an &quot;advantage chit&quot; allowed the person holding it to re-roll an single die roll (or rolls if it was a combat). In NWBM this changes. The player may spend the advantage to gain specific game benefits, automatically. Thus, rather than being hoarded, this &quot;twist of fate&quot; is likely to hop back and forth, as each player strives to save a desperate situation.<br/><br/>What is most amazing about NWBM is how much of a &quot;game&quot; it actually is, offering both players challenges and fateful decisions to make, in this classic face-off of well-known leadership.

This series presents a brigade-level system that highlights ease and speed of play combined with solid historical insight. Glory III follows the success of Glory II: Across the Rappahannock, and presents a polished system with ease of play, with two combat-intensive one-map battles. And it is still a game that can be played, and played well, by solitaire gamers.<br/><br/>Glory III features GMT's unique chit activation mechanic, which provides a great deal of play tension, as the commanders never quite know what is going to happen next. However, new command and combat mechanics make the game even more fun. Both battles have special command problems and some new and interesting mechanics to allow the players to play within the framework of those conditions.<br/><br/>Antietam, one of the major battles of the war, makes great use of the Glory activation system, linking the Union/McClellan command problems directly to its use. But it still allows the player to make choices, choices different from those Little Mac made, perhaps changing the course of the battle.<br/><br/>Cedar Creek is a great momentum battle, with an initial, probably highly effective Confederate surprise attack followed by the return of General Phil Sheridan to the battlefield, the arrival of George Custer's repeater-armed cavalry, and, hopefully for the Union Player, enough of a counter-attack to snatch victory from Jubal Early's rapidly munching jaws.

Troops start the day fresh and can make dramatic breakthroughs.  But, as damage occurs, troops are less willing to push forward, they will seek out defensive positions and wait for a new day.  Green troops, in particular, will tend to go to ground very quickly, while more elite troops can continue moving forward.  At this level, combat is abstracted, but operational aspects such as air support and corps and army artillery support are key parts of the system.<br/><br/>A number of scenario books are available for the system, including France 1940, Eastern Front, Normandy, North Africa, and the Pacific.<br/><br/>"}, "23969": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Evolutions", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1996", "usersrated": "8", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic237738_t.jpg", "average": "4.9", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Spear's Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic237738.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Trivia", "Word Game"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "From the rules:<br/><br/>The object of the game is to be the first player or team to complete the entire circle of the playing board from &quot;START&quot; to &quot;FINISH&quot; by correctly identifying the EVOLUTIONS Scenarios.<br/><br/>Basically, you answer trivia questions about the origins of common words and phrases, such as:<br/><br/>Q: The custom of dropping a piece of spiced, burnt bread into a glass of wine originated in Rome.

The long-standing feud between the Bourbons and Habsburgs erupted once again as both sides pressed their claim to the throne. No Peace Without Spain is a two-player game that elegantly recreates this epic struggle using a point-to-point map and a single deck of 55 cards. Action cards are used to activate armies for movement and siege, while event cards bring historical and special events into play that can swing the tide of fortune when least expected. Each turn represents one year, each corps represents 10,000 men of all arms and each leader represents a major commander and his staff.<br/><br/>The game features an easy and intuitive battle system that highlights a unique aspect of this war: team-based battle command, perhaps the most famous example being the extraordinary success achieved by the partnership of two of the war&rsquo;s most prominent commanders, the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene of Savoy. The Bourbon cause has talented leaders as well, notably Marshals Villars, Vendome and Berwick. These and other leaders are rated for Tactical and Command capabilities and they significantly influence the course of events.<br/><br/>The map stresses the importance of fortresses in a war that was probably the high-point of formal siege warfare. Fortresses in this era rarely held out against a besieger that had the necessary time and manpower to conduct a proper siege, and the game neatly recreates this with a simple siege table that leaves room for unusually stout defenses or quick collapses.<br/><br/>Victory points are gained or lost by the Alliance player and game victory comes either through automatic victory or based on final VPs after the 1713 turn.<br/><br/><br/>(BGG description:)<br/><br/>No Peace Without Spain is a two player game depicting the War of the Spanish Succession. The war was fought primarily to determine the fate of the Spanish throne and its dominions but also represented a continuing struggle for political, religious and economic dominance. One player represents the interests of the French claimant, Philip V (the Bourbons), while the other player represents the interests of the Austrian claimant, Charles III (the Alliance).<br/><br/>Each turn is one year. Each unit represents approximately 10,000 men of all arms.
