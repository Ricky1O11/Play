It is Irem's first attempt in the modern beat 'em up genre that was founded by Capcom's Final Fight. A few years later after its release, a lot of the team (artists, programmers, composers, designers, etc.) who made the game went on to form Nazca, who created the Metal Slug game series. The team have also worked on the Hammerin' Harry series, Superior Soldiers, In The Hunt and GunForce 2. In Japan, the game inspired a little-known series of underground comics due its brief popularity.<br/><br/>Players control &quot;city sweepers&quot; who fight crime by destroying thugs in New York City of the year 2043.<br/><br/>The video game is notable for its detailed backgrounds and grimy futuristic setting. For its time, it was relatively gory, featuring crow-pecked skeletons in the midst of its urban wastelands and forcing players to lose a life by being crushed by a garbage compactor during the first boss battle. While the gameplay is inspired by Capcom's Final Fight, some of the enemies are unique. Besides the usual human thugs, players fight strange mole creatures and mutants with jet packs and blades for hands. Players can never use enemy weapons, but the stages contain objects that can be picked up and used instead such as burning oil drums, steel girders, long concrete columns that shatter on impact, boxes of hand grenades and fish.<br/><br/>The characters eat mice, frogs, birds and snails to restore their health (many people in Japanese society eat these for their nutritional value).<br/><br/>The Japanese arcade version differs from the World version in several respects. The characters have a number of moves not seen in the World version, including dash + jump attacks, up to two different kinds of throws, and a powerful airborne special attack. The backgrounds and graphics are also different, especially at the start of Level Two and the end of Level Three. The music in the Japanese version has a more electronic feel and includes more voice samples. Some enemies carry broken bottles, knives and axes (in the World version these are replaced by planks and clubs). The mole creatures are weaker, taking only one hit to kill.

The game can be played by either one, two or even three players (Battle Mode-only) simultaneously. Various modes of racing include: regular season, battle (which is similar to exhibition or single race mode in other Formula One video games), and the time trial mode which tests how fast a player can drive his or her race car on any of the world's premier road courses. Only the vehicles from the 1994 season are used. Michael Schumacher and Satoru Nakajima are the most popular racers in this video game; even though Nakajima is a hidden character.<br/><br/>Teams and drivers:<br/>Williams: Damon Hill, David Coulthard<br/>Tyrrell: Ukyo Katayama, Mark Blundell<br/>Benetton: Michael Schumacher, J.J.

Up to four players can play and it has two different types of regular season modes in addition to battle and time trial modes.  Even though the game was only released in Japan, all in-game texts are in English.<br/><br/>A realistic pit crew fills up the player's fuel, fixes up all of the damaged components, and allows the players to choose from four different types of normal tires and four different types of rain tires. Reminders are given inside the vehicle and are assigned either a yellow code, a red code, or a blank code. Yellow codes can be safely ignored (except for fuel), red codes mean that the problem needs to be attended to at the pits, and blank codes means that the component is functioning perfectly. There are two different variations of tires with four degrees of hardness. The A tires are considered to be the hardest while the D tires are considered to be the softest.<br/>[edit] Options<br/><br/>For fans of vintage Formula One racing, a specially designed fantasy mode allows for either re-enactments of past Formula One championships or opportunities to change history. Alternatively, the real world mode is an actual representation of the 1995 Formula One season that is used with the drivers from 1995. Actual Formula One courses from the 1995 season are used and the object is to win as many races as possible so that a championship can be earned. Championships can be won in either the drivers' division, the constructors' division, or in both. Working as a team will come in handy when a crucial finishing moment in the race can mean the difference between winning the championship for your constructor or finishing the season without a championship win.<br/><br/>In the edit menu, contracts can be edited between drivers and new drivers can be created by manipulating the vital statistics of fictional Formula One drivers. The configuration (config) menu allows the players to make the game either harder or easier by changing the speed of the rival cars, the harshness of on-track collisions, the number of laps in a season, and the quickness of the pit crew to fix any damages and refuel the vehicle.<br/><br/>Records are held in a battery save in order for players to beat their personal best times. The race car drivers in this game use their actual names instead of names that sound similar to the actual drivers. Players can use cars from the 1992, 1993, 1994, or 1995 Formula One seasons. Separate records are held for battle and time attack because these are considered to be two separate forms of racing.<br/><br/>In order to save a record, one must use his personal name or a nickname that is up to eight characters long. Records are saved to the person not to the race car driver in order to differentiate between players who happen to play as the same driver(s). In the main menu, there is a special section for seeing past records (provided that no one erases the save game RAM). If the player does not qualify to beat a current record, then the player is not allowed to insert his name into the game.<br/><br/>Graphic clarity is considered to be one the clearest when compared to all the other Human Grand Prix games. In one example using the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal, the Montreal Biosph&egrave;re as well as the two bridges that cross near &Icirc;le Notre-Dame where the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve race track are shown in stunning detail for a game released in 1995. Another example are the Fuji TV signs that are shown on the walls of the Suzuka track that is the home to the Japanese Grand Prix. Another example of this graphic clarity is shown on the race cars themselves, the most notable being Red Bull (on Saubers) and Nokia (on Tyrrells) logos.<br/><br/>As stated before, the drivers in this game made their appearances between the 1992 and 1995 seasons of Formula One; however, it is noteworthy the absence of Ayrton Senna in the cast. Also, Giovanna Amati, Jean-Christophe Boullion, Thierry Boutsen and Christian Fittipaldi are listed in the game's Edit Mode as &quot;fictitious drivers&quot;, despite having their real pictures and data.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Human Grand Prix IV: F1 Dream Battle&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "108592": {"poll": [], "name": "F1 Pole Position 64", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["European Nintendo 64 edition", "Japanese Nintendo 64 edition", "North American Nintendo 64 edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1633707.jpg", "videogameseries": ["F1 Pole Position"], "videogametheme": ["Driving"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Human Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["Racing"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo 64"], "average": "6", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Human Entertainment", "Ubisoft Entertainment S.A.

Based in the 1996 Formula One season, it was released in 1997. Known in Japan as &quot;Human Grand Prix: The New Generation&quot;. Flags were added to the Driver menu and Japanese was replaced by English, German, and French languages in the versions outside Japan.<br/><br/>The game featured all the tracks from that Formula One season, at a time when the racing began in Australia, and ended in Japan. Teams would be set up with relevant drivers, however there was a roster-feature included, which allowed the player to swap drivers from one team to another, and even removing a real driver and replacing him with unknown drivers named Driver 1-6.<br/><br/>Grand Prix Mode allowed players to progress through the racing calendar, you could also choose single races or a time trial on various tracks. Battle mode allowed you to pick who you wanted to race against over a however many laps you chose. This added challenges to see if you could go from the back of the grid to 1st over one lap of Interlagos, Brazil. The game lacked destructible vehicles, and allowed players to only drive a maximum of 10 laps on every track, rendering the game quite unrealistic compared to other F1 games on the N64 such as F-1 World Grand Prix, released in 1998, and F-1 World Grand Prix II, released in 2000. The game also featured primitive graphics, almost reminiscent of the 16-bit Super Nintendo.

During this time, open wheel car racing and NASCAR-style racing has melded together to become an elite racing circuit for the fastest, youngest, and most daring drivers of auto racing in the world.<br/><br/>The player must save money to enter races and to research better racing equipment. The player must go through the Group C division, Formula 3000, and eventually to Formula One. To accomplish this, the player must practice really hard and win all the races in a circuit. It all starts out with strange courses, but it eventually leads back to the familiar Formula One courses once the player has won all the Group C and Formula 3000 races. Once the player is in Formula One, he must choose one of three teams. Engines to choose from include Ford, Honda, and Ferrari.<br/><br/>In addition to all this, the player must race all the courses in a certain order and can no longer choose the order in which to do those races. The Formula One portion of the game uses a season standings system in addition to keeping the times of individual races. The object of the game changes from simply winning the races to acquiring as many points as possible in order to win the championship.<br/><br/>Banging up the car, frequently usage of the pit stop, and careless mistakes will destroy championship hopes just like in the real Formula One. Not even cheat codes can guarantee a top ranking in the overall standings, just winning individual races and utilizing strong overtaking moves while preserving the body and tires of the player's chosen vehicle.<br/><br/>The game cartridge included a ST010 chip; a chip created by SETA for general functions and handling the intelligence of the computer cars. This chip offered unprecedented realism in the way that computer controlled-cars could perform aggressive manoeuvers with the speed and accuracy of real Formula One drivers. In addition to this, the chip allowed the game's artificial intelligence to perform tricks that were impossible to do with other racing video games released either during or before 1993.<br/><br/>Only through the release of the PlayStation and the Nintendo 64 console systems did the level of artificial intelligence in the console system made this special chip obsolete.<br/><br/>However, recent research related to development of the bsnes emulator revealed that the chip was not used to a big extent in the game. It had space for storing 16384 instruction words, however, only 533 of them were actually programmed. It shows that the algorithms running on the ST010 were in fact very simple.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;F1 ROC II: Race of Champions&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "108594": {"poll": [], "name": "FIFA 97: Gold Edition", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American SNES edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1584574.png", "videogameseries": ["FIFA"], "videogametheme": ["Sports - Soccer"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["EA Canada", "Rage Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["SNES"], "average": "4", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["EA Sports"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1584574_t.png", "description": "FIFA 97 (also known as FIFA Soccer 97) is a video game developed by EA Canada and published by Electronic Arts based around the game of football (soccer). It was released for the PC on June 24, 1996 and versions for PlayStation, SNES, Mega Drive and Sega Saturn followed.<br/><br/>FIFA 97 was the fourth game in the FIFA Series and the second to use the Virtual Stadium engine. Unlike the first game to use the engine, FIFA 97 features polygonal players as opposed to the 2D sprites used in FIFA Soccer '96. The engine however received complaints for being sluggish in the PC and PlayStation versions.<br/><br/>The main new feature of the game other than the motion capture was the indoor football mode. There were six ways to play the game, including outdoor and indoor, as well as action and simulaton modes. 32-bit AI was used, as well as motion blending technology which led to some of the sharpest graphics in any football game of the time. Here, it was possible to play six-a-side football in an indoor arena with the ball bouncing off the walls meaning there is no throw-ins and therefore a much higher paced game. Leagues available in the game included the English, French, Italian, German, Dutch, Scottish leagues and the Malaysian M-league and other sides, as well as the American A-League clubs with fictional teams, composed of the game's creators such as Bruce McMillan and Penny Lee. Commentary is provided by John Motson and Andy Gray while the presenter is Des Lynam. Multiplayer games are also possible with up to 20-players via. LAN and 8-players using modem. The game trailer's tagline was &quot;FIFA 97, it will blow you away.&quot; Most European domestic leagues were featured in the game, including the English Premier League, but only teams from each nation's highest division were playable. The English clubs featured in the game were those who played in the 1995-96 Premier League. It was also possible to field custom teams made up of players from various real teams. However,these teams could only be played with in friendly matches.<br/><br/>David Ginola (then a Newcastle United player) graced the cover of the game in the European market. He also was used for motion capture for the polygonal models in the game. Bebeto (the Brazilian striker) was featured on the cover for the Americas and Asia-Pacific markets.<br/><br/>The game's commentary included the names of the majority of players on the game, and the names of the teams were also said by John Motson. Several errors plagued the game's commentary, such as John Millar of Heart of Midlothian being referred to as Joe Miller, who in fact plays for Aberdeen on the game. Also, at times when a goal kick was awarded, the commentator would say that the kick had been given to the opposing team. Another similar error was that a kick-off would be referred to as a cross, as well as a goal in the first minute being described as a goal &quot;that would win it surely&quot;. On rare occasions, when the game was being introduced by Desmond Lynam , the name of a player involved in the game would be said by John Motson, instead of Lynam saying the names of both teams. For example, a match between Partick Thistle F.C. and Kilmarnock F.C. would sometimes be introduced by Lynam saying &quot;Welcome to the big match between-&quot;, and Motson's voice interjecting with &quot;MacPherson.&quot;<br/><br/>The pronunciation of certain players' names would change depending upon whether they were performing attacking or defensive duties, such as Roy Aitken being referred to as &quot;Akin&quot; if he made a tackle or clearance. Similarly, Alessandro Del Piero, who was called &quot;Del Piero Togon&quot; on the game, was referred to as &quot;Del Piero Tognon&quot; , followed by a small hiccuping noise when he performed a tackle. Such commentary errors did not take away from the game's appeal, and in fact have given it a cult status amongst many players which means the game is still widely played today.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;FIFA 97&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "108595": {"poll": [], "name": "Fighter's History", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Arcade edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1554487.png", "videogameseries": ["Fighter's History"], "videogametheme": ["Martial Arts"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Data East"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade"], "average": "2", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Data East"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1554487_t.png", "description": "The original Fighter's History was first released as an arcade game in 1993.

In addition to the story-based Mizoguchi Mode, there are also three new game modes (Practice, Tag Battle, and Survival) in addition to the traditional CPU Battle and 2-Player Versus Modes.<br/><br/>There are only nine playable characters in this installment, as five of the characters from the previous Fighter's History games were cut from the roster (Ray, Jean, Matlock, Samchay, and Marstorius).

The story of the game is generally based on the 1960s The Flintstones cartoon series.<br/><br/>In the opening story of the game, the Water Buffalos' leader, the Great Poobah, decides to retire.   As his last decree as Great Poobah, he makes a contest in which whoever finds the Treasure of Sierra Madrock will be his successor. In the game, Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble must find the treasure before any other Buffalo member (or even their wives, Wilma and Betty). The game features passwords that must be written down in order to continue the game from the highest level reached.<br/><br/>The game itself first involves a world map representing a themed set of worlds. Both characters move like they would in a traditional board game by rolling dice and move to the appropriate space. Depending on the landed space, the player must clear a level in that particular world, defeat bosses, or enter shops, among other things. On some zones, Wilma and Betty appear and if any one of them manage to meet their respective husband, she will drag him some spaces back to an arbitrary location. The levels themselves are simple platformer segments. In these segments, the characters must traverse from left to right (and sometimes right to left), while avoiding hazards and defeating dinosaurs, Water Buffalo members or other creatures. In order to defeat enemies, Fred and Barney use a wood club.<br/><br/>There are also powerups such as brontoburger (energy) and clams, which are used to buy items in shops. In a few cases, a powerup is a trap in which the Cavemouse appears, being followed by Dino. Unlike the TV show, Dino actually hurts the player if he is hit by him. The earlier zones in the game can only be cleared by first defeating specific Water Buffalo members (most of which appeared at some point in the cartoon series) by winning them in a race located at a stadium. For that purpose, they must be found. If any character go to the stadium, the race can be practiced. Once defeated, they will give an item to both Fred and Barney, so that they can go the next world.  The types of worlds involved include Bedrock, Snowrock (an ice world), and Magmarock (a fire world), amongst other worlds present in the game.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The Flintstones: The Treasure of Sierra Madrock&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "108609": {"poll": [], "name": "Football Fury", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Super Famicom edition", "North American SNES edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Sports - American Football"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Aicom"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["SNES"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["High Moon Studios"], "description": "Football Fury (\u30a6\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30e1\u30a4\u30c8 \u30d5\u30c3\u30c8\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb &quot;Ultimate Football&quot;) is fully called Ultimate Football: Try Formation! in Japanese.<br/><br/>The gameplay takes place in a playoffs system of a fictional American football league. Gameplay involves the usual football fare of choosing a play and attempting to execute it.  On offense, when throwing the football, a meter appears which measures the strength of the passer's throw.  On defense, the player controls a defensive player and tries to tackle the opposing ball carrier or attempt to break up a pass play. There is an option to either play with or without background music.<br/><br/>With its fictitious teams, the designers were giving up any pretense of their game being an authentic simulation of the NFL.  The designers who made Football Fury were trying to invent almost 30 new teams from scratch, in a limited amount of time.  A lot of the logos used in this game are nonsensical like the rifle used for the Hunters team, for example. There are two conferences: the United States Football Conference (USFC) and the American All-Star Football Conference (AAFC). Even though the teams are fictional, they use the cities of the actual NFL teams of the early 1990s.   Passwords allow saved games to be restored while a news report is made after each game through the fictional cable television network ZIFN.

Without proper clothes or equipment, you must reach the civilized village before you die from hunger, thirst or exhaustion. But there are wild animals lurking, mountains blocking the way, and a wide variety of unpleasant diseases waiting to invade your body. When you think it cannot possibly get any worse, you feel a taunting raindrop on your cheek&hellip;<br/><br/>In Wilderness, 2 to 8 players race to the nearest civilized village &ndash; but the village is not near, and the way there is not paved. You will have to find water, search for food, avoid wolves, bears and snakes, endure sicknesses and keep your strength up to be able to get there.<br/><br/>Each player's health is tracked with three parameters: thirst, hunger and exhaustion. Every turn you get more thirsty and hungry and exhausted. The thirstier and hungrier you are, the more exhausted you become, and that determines how much energy you will have each turn. If the exhaustion hits the bottom, you die. The energy is used to walk, but also to search for food or rest. To regain your strength (reduce your exhaustion) you also have to sleep. One of the biggest risks is encountering a predator since they attack you with two dice and you defend with only one and increase exhaustion equal to the difference. And they can scent you from a mile away...<br/><br/>The game board is discovered gradually as players progress across it, and there are six turns each day (four day turns, two night turns). Each day has different special rules and each landscape tile has its own challenges. Each landscape tile has 21 hexagonal areas in a big triangle and each area has a terrain type such as mountain, wood, swamp and so on, and the tile may also include a predator lair. Different terrain types have their benefits and challenges. The combination and orientation of different landscape tiles make the way forward uncertain and new every game. To top it off, the players have a limited supply of cards that can be played to help yourself or thwart your opponent in certain situations.<br/><br/>Besides the normal six-tile board, the game can be played in an easy, short version by having only four landscape tiles, or it can be played in a challenging long version by including all eight available landscape tiles.<br/><br/>The hand-made edition of Wilderness sold out at Spiel 2011. FryxGames is releasing a professionally published version in the first half of 2012, and this version will have improved game play and graphics. For example, search for food has replaced hunting. It is not very likely that you have the equipment you need to hunt. Instead, food will be slightly easier to find but will not fill your stomach as much as before.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition (handmade)", "English second edition"], "average": "6.71679", "name": "Wilderness", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Modular Board"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "294", "boardgameaccessory": ["Wilderness: Female Characters"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Indiegogo"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The Spiel at Essen 2011 - Wilderness"]}, "108638": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Susanne Galonska"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "H\u00f6rt!

Have you ever played a game where you are limited by character classes? The Twilight system allows you<br/>to make anyone or anything you can imagine,  right off the bat. Have you ever swung a longsword, barely nicked your  foe, yet done maximum damage? The Twilight combat  system makes sense &ndash; you even  fight badly  when  wounded.  Have  you  ever  wondered  whether  that  new  spell  your  character researched  is particularly overpowered? The Twilight power system breaks magic down into components that can create any spell, game balance guaranteed. (Sadly, it&rsquo;s unavailable in the demo version.)<br/>And all you need to play is a handful of six-sided dice (the d6). Once you get the hang of it, you won&rsquo;t even need the rulebook &ndash; the system doesn&rsquo;t use many tables, and the core mechanic is very simple.<br/>And  finally, there&rsquo;s a conversion guide that allows you to convert to or  from D&amp;D  (3rd edition).

Used special cards are returned to their stacks, and players can optionally cash in unused special cards for one point each (or two points for a map). Players then shuffle the resource cards and play a second stage following the same rules, starting with cards in hand from the first stage.

Founded to protect pilgrims on their journeys to the Holy Land, the &quot;poor comrades-in-arms of Christ and the Temple of Solomon&quot; would eventually grow a network of strongholds (&quot;Commanderies&quot;) throughout the Christian world, where novice knights were trained, and trade goods could be managed and exchanged. By 1307, the &ldquo;poor comrades-in-arms&rdquo; were one of the richest organizations in Europe: one that would attract the covetous eyes of the French king.<br/><br/>In The Mystery of the Templars, players become the masters of this secretive organization. They must assign their knights to the critical task of escorting pilgrims, but also to seek out and discover long-lost artifacts of Christian lore. Using their holdings in the Holy Land, they procure valuable trade goods, which must then be transported to the hungry markets of Europe, using the profits to expand the Order&rsquo;s holdings. But along the way brigands and pirates threaten the flow of goods and wealth, and must be challenged by valorous knights to safeguard the precious caravans and trade ships.

He will begin the second phase of the game with his first pack of three cards, then gradually as the game progresses, he will receive the other two packets of three cards.<br/><br/>Next comes the Tournament: at the beginning of each round a player will roll the seasons dice (dice = number of players +1).<br/><br/>These cubes offer a variety of actions to the players: <br/>- Increase your gauge (maximum number of cards you may have placed on the table and in play) <br/>- Harvesting energy (water, earth, fire, air) to pay the cost of power cards<br/>- Crystallizing the energy (during the current season) to collect crystals. Crystals serve both as a resource to pay for some cards, but also as victory points in the end. <br/>- Draw new cards<br/><br/>Each player can choose only one die per turn. The die not chosen by anyone determines how many fields the &quot;time track&quot; would move forward.<br/>In addition, all the dice are different depending on the season. For example, there are not the same energies to a particular season. Throughout the game, players will therefore have to adapt to these changes - also the &quot;exchange rates&quot; of energy to crystals vary during seasons - the energy not present on the dice in any given season is also the best paid during the season.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the crystals are summed with victory points granted by the cards (minus some penalties, where applicable).

These games share some of the same components, but each game has a unique board, and two of the games have card decks just for them. It appears that none of these games were ever produced separately. All games may be played solo, or with a number of other players based on the game.<br/><br/>Grand Pree Road Race<br/><br/>Players use cars 1 through 12 and move the their cars around a game board track as instructed by a spinner and by use of a deck of cards that comes with the game. Special rules govern how many cars may occupy a space, and which car(s) get to move in the event of too may cars heading toward the same space. First player to pass the finish line wins.<br/><br/>Demolition Derby<br/><br/>Up to 30 cars may be included, although 10 players seems to me the suggested maximum. (This allows each player to control three cars.) Game is played on the Demolition Derby board which features some Safe spots where cars may not be hit.<br/><br/>Cars move by means of a spinner (numbered 1 to 30) to determine which car is moved and a special deck of cards which determines distance and direction of movement. (Some cards allow for a choice about direction.) Since there is a set turn order, a player may end up moving an opponent's car.<br/><br/>When a car passes onto or over another car, the stationary car takes a Hit. Cars that take three Hits are eliminated from the game and removed from play. A wipe-off scoreboard with a crayon and a felt eraser are included to keep track of Hits. Play continues until only one car remains.<br/><br/>Drag Race Championships<br/><br/>Again all 30 cars are used. The game uses the Drag Race board. Before play begins, the 1-30 spinner is used to determine which cars are in which Heats. Play progresses by using the 1-12 spinner which shows which color car is moved, along with the roll of a single die to determine distance. One car advances from each of the 6 Heats. A final round is played to determine the Champion.<br/><br/>The 500 Mile Race<br/><br/>This game is played on the box insert which shows an oval track with various Sequence Tables printed in the center. Game may be played with up to 30 players, each controlling an individual car. The game starts with the Sequence Marker on Sequence Table &quot;A&quot;. Two dice are rolled and the numbers are added together. (The Sequence Table contains results from 2 to 12.) The result of the Sequence Table tells which cars may be moved... these cars are all advanced 3 spaces on the track. In the next turn the Sequence Marker is advanced and Sequence Table &quot;B&quot; is used. The Sequence Marker moves each turn, and goes back to Table A again if the game last long enough. Some Sequence Table results show hazards like Crash, Pit Stop, etc. The 1-30 spinner is used to determine which car is affected.<br/><br/>Four cars abreast stop cars behind them from advancing. However, there are a couple of spots on the board where cars are considered to crash if there are ever four cars on them. (This cuts down on the amount of log jams in a really crowded game.) Play continues until a car crosses the finish line. In the event of a tie, play continues until one car advances ahead of another.<br/><br/>The (many) game elements for this title include: one double-sided rules sheet, 30 die-cut pressboard cars, a sequence marker, a double-sided game board (with the Grand Pree race board on one side, and the Demolition Derby and Drag Race boards on the other), a wipe-off scoreboard (for Demolition Derby), a crayon &amp; felt eraser, a 1-30 spinner, a 1-12 spinner, two 6-sided dice, a deck of 20 cards with an image of a tire on the back (for Grand Pree Road Race), &amp; a deck of 20 cards with checkered flags on the back (for Demolition Derby).<br/><br/>No publication date is included with this title.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "7", "name": "Race-O-Rama Game Chest", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Auto Racing"]}, "108795": {"poll": [], "name": "Alien Evolution", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European ZX Spectrum edition", "ZX Spectrum (Your Sinclair cover tape) edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3058246.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Post-Apocalyptic", "Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Gremlin Graphics (1983-1994)"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Arcade"], "videogameplatform": ["ZX Spectrum"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Gremlin Graphics (1983-1994)", "Your Sinclair"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3058246_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Earth has been completely destroyed.

Hebereke means drunk or untrustworthy. Popoon is an onomatopoeia for the sound made by the game pieces when they explode.<br/><br/>Hebereke's Popoon is a block-grouping game closer in style to Dr. Mario than Tetris. There are eight playable characters, each having different abilities. In one-player mode, the player is forced to choose Hebereke and must play against Oh-Chan. After defeating Oh-Chan, the player is allowed to choose between Hebereke and Oh-Chan in the next match against Sukezaemon, and so on, until the player has &quot;unlocked&quot; all the characters. Each match consists of a single-round. A defeated player may elect to resume play by using a continue. In two-player mode, all characters are immediately available to either player and each match is the best of three rounds. Players can also select a handicap level (from 1 - 5) to increase or decrease the difficulty of the game.<br/><br/>In each round, pairs of Popoons of various colors (the set of colors varying with the character(s) chosen by the player(s)) descend from the top of the screen. These can be rotated and placed by the player. The immediate aim is to create groups of three blocks of the same color arranged either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. When such a group is created, the member blobs blow up, disappearing from the screen. Any blobs above the disappearing group then drop to fill any resulting empty space.<br/><br/>Each time a player successfully creates a group, a piece resembling the head of the player's character will drop on the other player's screen in a random position. These &quot;heads&quot; can be removed by the second player by placing a blob of the same color as the head such that it touches the head either horizontally or vertically. Both the head and the blob will disappear from the screen, in much the same manner as group of blobs, though no head will appear on the first player's screen as a result.<br/><br/>A player can sometimes cause multiple groups to disappear. This can happen simultaneously if the placement of a pair of blobs immediately causes two groups of blobs (or heads) to form or it can happen in a chain reaction, as the formation and disappearance of one group causes the dropping of any pieces above it, which can result in the formation of another group, and so on. If the groups in either process are of different colors then this is said to be a combination or &quot;combo.&quot; The colors in a combo (or even a group) appear as small tiles in the lower of two panes in the middle of the screen and above the score-box.<br/><br/>While a combo of one color (simply an ordinary group) causes a single head to appear on the opponent's screen, a combo of two colors causes a full row of heads to appear on the opponent's screen. Combos of three and four colors are much more dramatic, the precise effect depending on the player's character. Upcoming heads or special effects are kept track of by symbols placed by the players' characters in the upper of two panels in the middle of the screen.<br/><br/>A notable feature in Hebereke's Popoon is the constant bevy of sound effects as each player's character celebrates each group or combo by making nonsense sounds or yelling Japanese phrases.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Hebereke no Popoon&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "108818": {"poll": [], "name": "Incantation", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American SNES edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Titus Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["SNES"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Titus Software"], "description": "The game was published late in the lifetime of the Super NES, at a point when releases for 16-bit gaming consoles were not highly anticipated; in addition its developer Titus also enjoyed a poor reputation at the time.

The Super NES game is actually a port of an original coin-op version. The game is presented in a mixed perspective. The pre-shot perspective is a standard third-person view from just behind the golfer, but once the ball is hit, the view switches to a top-down perspective to track the ball in flight. The game takes a simplified approach to hitting the ball. Instead of setting the power and controlling the shot, the only function of the vertically-oriented swing meter is to select the vertical angle of the shot, which, in turn, sets the amount of backspin/topspin applied to the ball. The strength of each swing is selected prior to the shot by setting a power gauge to one of 16 levels. Draw and fade can be applied to the ball by changing the players stance. It all might sound complicated, but it's fairly straightforward. The putting system appears to be simple. However, the game specifies the maximum distance for the putter in yards (but measures distance on the greens in meters). There are no distance markers shown on the hole overview making it difficult to accurately place shots without them, especially lay-up shots.<br/><br/>Players can choose to play as one of four golfers (power hitter, all-round player, technician, and magician). Each of these golfers possess a unique skill set that influences the player's ability to make certain types of shots. The game provides the usual array of game modes: tournament, match play, stroke play, and a skins game.<br/><br/>In the original arcade game, the technician golfer is a man, instead of being a woman.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The Irem Skins Game&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "108822": {"poll": [], "name": "The Itchy & Scratchy Game", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA SNES edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Bits Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["SNES"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Acclaim Entertainment Inc."], "description": "The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Game is a side-scrolling platformer based on The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show, a show within a show in the animated television series The Simpsons.

Master uses the same basic game play as the decades old Elfer raus, but adds a few twists. The game is played using a deck of 103 cards, consisting of:<br/><br/>    84 number cards, numbered 1 to 21 in four colours;<br/>    15 connection cards;<br/>    4 jokers.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>There are also seven bonus cards used in scorekeeping.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, the eleven of each color is placed in the middle of the table in a column. The other number cards and the jokers are shuffled together, and each player receives a number of those cards as well as a number of connection cards. The goal of the game is to play all of your number and joker cards by building a grid &ndash; four rows, each from one to twenty-one.<br/><br/>Each turn, you may play up to four cards from your hand. If you cannot play a card, or don't want to, you draw one card from the draw pile. The cards must be played according to the following rules:<br/><br/>    You must place a number card next to a card that is one higher or lower of the same colour and that is already on the table. So, the red twelve must be placed next to the red eleven, and the red thirteen must be placed next to the red twelve (or in front of the red fourteen). So, the red thirteen cannot be played if neither the twelve nor the fourteen has been played unless you use a connection card.<br/>    Alternatively, you can use a connection card to place a card above or below a card with the same number and a different colour. For example, if the green row is above the yellow row, and the green nine has already been played, you may use a connection card to play the yellow nine in the yellow row. The connection cards are not part of your hand, so they don't count toward the maximum of four cards that you may play during a round.<br/>    A joker may be placed instead of any other number cards. If a player has a number card whose spot is occupied by a joker, he may exchange that card for the joker.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>If a player completes a segment from one to eleven or from eleven to twenty-one, he receives a bonus card.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has played the last card from his hand. Then, points are counted:<br/><br/>    Each bonus card is worth 11 points.<br/>    Each number card that a player still holds is worth as many minus points as its value.<br/>    Each joker that a player still holds is worth 11 minus points.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Reimplements:<br/><br/>    Elfer raus!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "108863": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Paul Rohrbaugh"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "So You Want to Teach?", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting"], "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Bruce Yearian"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["High Flying Dice Games"], "boardgameversion": ["High Flying Dice first edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "So You Want to Teach is a card driven game for two to four players on the issues and events many beginning teachers must deal with in the course of becoming a professional educator.

The drawn card&rsquo;s Event is revealed/ read aloud to the others after which players can bid for the event by playing cards from their deck. The winner of the bidding will then take procession of the card, adding it to their &ldquo;Portfolio&rdquo;. A card that is not claimed will go into the discard pile.

Armour can also now be upgraded and improved rather then just replaced with the next best set.

It is the first in the series to support 3D and Playstation Move and the first to introduce the PSN PASS program. In North America, Resistance 3 comes in two editions: Standard &amp; Doomsday Edition. In PAL regions it comes in Special Edition and Survivor Edition featuring physical collectibles related to the game.<br/><br/>The game retains mostly the same gameplay mechanics as its predecessor albeit with several changes. The weapon wheel and health bar from the first Resistance game return after it was excluded from Resistance 2. There are also new environmental objects such as chimeran plants which explode when shot. The game sees a mixture of new and old weapons; returning weapons include the Bullseye, Magnum, Rossmore, Auger, Marksman and Carbine. New weapons include the Mutator, which shoots biological mist that causes enemies to eventually explode causing splash damage, the Deadeye sniper rifle, and a new food-can based explosive called a shrapnel grenade, which releases an arsenal of nails when it explodes.  All weapons are upgradeable, and become more powerful the more they are used.  In line with the survival theme of Resistance 3, humans are forced to assemble their weapons from whatever scrap they can gather.<br/><br/>The game features PlayStation Move support and Stereoscopic 3D.

Drafting, teamwork, accidents, yellow flags, pit strategy, working to lead laps, and sprints to the finish are all included and bring the feel of racing to the game. Players control not one car, but a team of 3&ndash;6 cars. Thus, each race is not only a run for the checkered flag but an effort to maximize the score for every car on your team. Winning is important, but if only one car crosses the finish line, your team might end up outside the winner's circle looking in.<br/><br/>The game includes four different types of movement, often with many cars moving with the play of a single card, and each type has its place and time:<br/><br/><br/>    Solo movement allows you to break away from the pack.<br/>    Draft and pursuit movement are best used for keeping your team of cars together.<br/>    Lead movement can create a pack of cars that moves toward the front.<br/><br/><br/>Turns are fast, each play is important, and the track situation is fluid. The wrong movement in the wrong situation can be disastrous, with you possibly being left out of the draft and all alone. Experienced players will be able to identify the best type of movement for the current situation.<br/><br/>Cars suffer wear over the course of a race and need to take pit stops. Tire wear, suspension difficulties, fuel issues, and major engine and transmission problems are all modeled in the game. If you feel lucky, you might try to hold it together just a little bit longer in hopes that a yellow flag will come out and cause a mass rush into the pits. Waiting on a yellow that never comes can be maddening as the rest of the pack moves by your worn-out car. What's more, an events deck can make your strategy pay off or punish you for your failure to take precautions. Accidents, yellow flags, worsening track situations, and deteriorating cars are all part of the game. Could all of your perfect strategy be derailed by those incoming rain clouds?<br/><br/>Included in the game are four different race tracks: a tri-oval super speedway for wide-open free-wheeling racing and a short track for a tight wheel-to-wheel bumper car duel. Each track uses the same deck of racing cards but the cards that work best on one may be useless in the other.  The game also includes a second board with a road course and and 3 turned  (triangle) raceway.<br/><br/>Most racing games call for a large number of players to play the game at its best.

Each character in the posse can be customized to fulfill a different role and purchase weapons and equipment from the many options available. Combat takes place in the futuristic landscape of the year 2285, where a supervolcano erupted and changed the course of mankind forever.<br/><br/>In the general the game is built around D12s and is meant to be light, thematic, and fast playing. Players build a Posse containing a Leader, 2-4 Members, and up to 1 Dinosaur, all of which benefit from some unique mechanics. Each Member has an Allegiance such as Duster or Neotechnoist which helps differentiate them (both thematically and statistically). Otherwise there are fairly standard statistics (Speed, Defense, Hitpoints, etc.) which can be customized by spending Improvement Points to really help define a role for each character. Furthermore Active and Passive Traits are selected to let characters do cool things like Crippling Shot, Speed Reload, Go For the Eyes, etc. Weapons and equipment are then purchased from a list of over 75 items ranging from laser Six-Shooters to plasma Shotguns.<br/><br/>A standard game takes place on a tabletop covered in terrain and uses 28mm miniatures and plastic dinosaur toys. Activation of entities is done on a model-by-model basis instead of the entire Posse at once, so the battles are very fluid with plenty of time to react to the enemy. This is especially true as Initiative is rolled at the start of each Activation &quot;set&quot; instead of staying the same for the whole turn.<br/><br/>Posses battle each other in one-off standalone games or in a linked campaign where further Improvement Points and Neodollars can be used to build and grow the group. Likewise injuries can accrue on characters that were taken out of action during an encounter. Deployment, objectives, and features can be used to add depth and variety to each battle beyond &quot;kill everything&quot;.<br/><br/>The full rules are free to download and can be used with any range of miniatures. There is also a free &quot;beginner version&quot; (called Quickdraw) which condenses the core mechanics to under 10 pages, so players can jump into the game very easily.<br/><br/>"}, "108941": {"average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Auf der Eisenbahn", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "1952", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2461160_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["K.

It represents over three years of work, including a considerable amount of play testing by a large number of people.<br/><br/>One of the key results I was looking for when designing Morpheus was to have a playable, enjoyable game that was very full without forcing the person who wants to play to read 50 book with 150 pages each in them. I think that I have achieved this. The idea to base Morpheus on dreams was made from the very start and the entire game was designed around dreams. Initially, Morpheus was strictly a two player game, where one person would set up the &quot;dream&quot; and another person would travel through it. This worked well enough but lacked the excitement and fun of multi-player games, and so I began looking around for ideas to help incorporate multiple players into a single dream sequence. Eventually the Morpheus &quot;Mind Park&quot; was formed, and things really began to move then. Although in the Mind Park you are not truly dreaming the adventures that you partake in, it does all exist in your head, and the level of imagination you can muster is a key factor to your survivability. Because you adventure in computer generated worlds that exist only in your head reality kind of has the tendency to go flying out the window, and this opens up immense possibilities for the gamer. When writing the rules for Morpheus, I did not try to simulate reality at all, which is why I don't need as many rules as most of the other games. The rules you see are merely guidelines set down by Gaming Central at Morpheus, not an attempt to duplicate the real world on paper. This is why you won't find immense tables dealing with the amount and kind of spells a second level prist an cast ... I simply didn't need them.<br/><br/>Referees should find themselves totally free to create what they will. The only restrictions put on a Referee is that he be consistent, and make the game reasonably fair and possible to win. Other than that, he can do pretty much whatever he wants. If a refereee wants to make a wizard that can turn people into frogs 4 times a day with no chance of missing, then so be it!<br/><br/>Also, the possibility of playing characters that are not necessarily connected to the adventrue that they are participating in is very interesting to me, and to everyone who has played. I happen have a character called &quot;Mr.Big&quot; who is sort of pseudo 1930's gangster, and he has been in adventures in fantasy/magic worlds and it was a lot of fun! Most of the natives perceived him as an eccentric but powerful wizard with some odd habits and a funny accent.<br/><br/>In any event, enjoy yourself! The things that you can do with Morpheus is almost endless and I hope you have fun with it for a long, long time!<br/><br/>(Verbatim from Designer's Notes in the boxed edition)<br/><br/>"}, "108962": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Edition"], "poll": [], "name": "ChalkChain", "rpgdesigner": ["Sean Preston"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3067775.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["RunePunk"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Modern Urban Fantasy)", "Occult (Magic)", "Steampunk"], "rpgpublisher": ["Reality Blurs"], "rpg": ["Savage Worlds"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["RunePunk Guidebooks"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3067775_t.png", "description": "From publisher website<br/><br/>Ready for ChalkChain?

Or will you become infected by the Undead and turn on your allies? The possibilities are endless in a game that utilizes randomization and custom structure mechanics that immerse players in a completely fresh scenario with every new round of play.<br/><br/>Based on the ENDICOTT EPIDEMIC multi-media series created by filmmaker and author Douglas Harvey, Endicott Epidemic: The Board Game is the first full board game that accompanies the Endicott Epidemic: Infectious Contagion card game.  While Infectious Contagion was the condensed, &quot;lite&quot; version of the main game, EE:TBG is an epic battle for survival that offers all of the insane mechanics and suspenseful buildup to destruction that the card game couldn't bring to the table (literally).<br/><br/>Utilizing game boards acting as maps based on primary areas of the Endicott Epidemic story (with fully functional expansion &quot;connections&quot; to mix and match your favorite ares as the game expands), players will drop their chosen characters (each with their own unique abilities that can be used strategically) into the heart of the epidemic and begin battling the Undead using classic roll-and-move mechanics as well as a series of unique &quot;Intrique&quot; cubes that modify gameplay with every roll.  A deck of Inquest cards act as side-missions that can be ignored or completed to gain resources used to fight and survive, or to gain special tokens that can be used in many different combinations to unlock new areas of play as the game progresses.<br/><br/>Combat is as simple as choosing your weapon (or brawling unarmed, if you so choose) and rolling the Combat Cubes.  Each face of each cube means a different value, giving you numerous combinations of attack to dish out against your chosen enemy.  But while rolling the cubes is the simple part, bear in mind that your enemies can (and most of the time *will*) fight back or dodge your attack entirely.  Strategize your plan of action before engaging the enemy to give you the best course through the hordes of Undead.  Or, if you think you have the stealth abilities to do so, roll the dice to try to evade the groups of enemies and slip through unnoticed and live to fight another turn.<br/><br/>But beware - hidden with the game's deck of cards lay numerous deadly obstacles ranging from stronger than average 'Boss' Zombies, Black Ops agents, and even a handful of mutant Hazard Zombies, which spread MBI's toxic plume everywhere they go.  Once these villains begin to appear, the spreading plume is something the Survivors must be extremely wary of.  Plume markers begin to build in each area and once they reach their critical mass, deadly chain reactions are caused that could potentially wipe out every living thing on the board.  The biggest and most brutal enemy within the deck, however, is the Countdown - eight cards that constantly remind players of the impending nuclear purge.  Once the eighth and final card is drawn, the game is over - regardless of whether or not the survivors have completed their mission to find the Hermit, his critical intel, and his escape route.<br/><br/>With all of the chaos going on as each Survivor makes their way through the town to complete their mission, the gameplay could get a little too intense for some people's liking.  Endicott Epidemic: The Board Game utilizes a completely customizable experience so that players can create the best scenario that is tailored to how they want to enjoy their game.  Removing certain aspects of the game like Hazard Zombies or Plume counters can greatly reduce the amount of suspenseful buildup that could turn players off from a game that could potentially be nearly impossible to win.  Inventory management and play deck building are also ways a group of players can ease the difficulty and ensure that the game, if played with all the right moves and strategic plans, can indeed be won without laying at the mercy of the Countdown or the roll of a die.<br/><br/>The board game, at its core, is designed for 2-8 players.  However, like Infectious Contagion, the board game also allows a single player to enjoy the game experience as the lone survivor of Endicott&rsquo;s shift from living to undead.  Other game modes include a point-based Survivor mode that removes the Countdown and many other aspects of the game to allow players (or factions/teams of players) to battle waves of Undead, tallying up points at the end of each round and crowning a winner after a set amount of battles.  Or, players (or teams) can simply battle each other without the inclusion of Zombies (but with a Countdown) in a vastly customizable VS mode.<br/><br/>A ticking time-bomb's clock, swarms of Undead that will chain themselves together to create deadly hordes, an ever-spreading toxic plume beneath your feet, stealthy Black Ops agents that mark you for execution when you fall within their sights, a limited number of resources that must be used in conjunction with an even more limited inventory system, a constant surge of adrenaline with every roll of the Intrigue cubes, making allies with your fellow Survivors only to find your group surrounded by Zombies with only two bullets and a grenade...all of this and more is what builds your game up from a simple beginning to an all-out epic battle for survival.  Think you can handle it?<br/><br/>"}, "108965": {"poll": [], "name": "Undead Empire", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Xbox 360 XBLI edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Zombies"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Big Rook Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Xbox 360"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Microsoft Game Studios"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A top down zombie shooter that features a story and survival mode, as well as co-op play for up to four players.
