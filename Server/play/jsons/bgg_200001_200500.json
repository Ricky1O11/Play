In each round, players designate one action for each character token of his or her ayllu. The actions available for a character of a given ayllu are indicated in the general board (a board shared by all players) and in its player's personal board (a board for that ayllu only).<br/><br/>Through the actions decided by each player, an 'ayllu' obtains enough food for each season, plays the cards in its player's hand -which develop technologies and new ideas-, and specializes artisans, warriors or holy priests of Wari, the god-demon of Chav&iacute;n. Players may attack one another, or even force the others into hunger.<br/><br/>When the four seasons of the game end, the player with the highest &quot;Development Score&quot; wins.

Armed with a Force Deck of 30 cards (consisting of SD Cards, Weapon Cards, and Mission Cards), 2 battleships, and 10 points worth of Power Supply Chips, each player&rsquo;s objective is to win battles among SD Gundams and move their 2 battleships to collect Power Supply Chips and advance into enemy territory, ultimately destroying their opponent's 2 battleships or conquering their opponent's base.<br/><br/>The game is played on two connected game mats with a Battlefield where SD Cards fight, a Command Board where battleships move to attack their opponent, activate Power Supply Chips, or Capture their opponent's Base, and an area where support SD Cards, Mission Cards, and Weapon Cards are played. Gameplay consists of five stages that are repeated until a player either destroys their opponent's 2 battleships or moves one of their battleships onto their opponent's base.<br/><br/>Supply Stage:<br/>Draw one card from the Force Deck into your hand.<br/><br/>Advance Stage:<br/>Move a battleship one connecting space on the Command Board, flipping over any Power Supply Chips it lands on.<br/><br/>Operation Stage: This stage is skipped during a player&rsquo;s first turn.<br/>Choose a Weapon Card with a range capable of attacking your opponent&rsquo;s battleship from your hand and place it on the Weapon Card area in the Force Sector.  Its Power Supply Requirement must be paid and the SD Symbol on the Chip must match the SD Symbol on the card being put into play. Weapon Cards are not sent to the Discard Pile until the Battle Stage is finished.<br/><br/>Battle Stage: This stage is skipped during a player&rsquo;s first turn.<br/>1. The player that initiates the attack goes first by choosing one of the SD Cards on their Battlefield and flipping it over. In order to attack, the chosen SD Card must have must have a target grid that highlights an area where an opponent&rsquo;s SD Card is placed.<br/><br/>2. The ATTACKER and DEFENDER compare SD Powers. The SD Card with the higher Power, taking into account all Effects in play, wins the battle. The winning SD Card stays on the Battlefield face up. The losing SD Card gets sent to that player&rsquo;s Discard Pile. In the event of a tie, both SD Cards remain face up on the Battlefield for the next turn. Face-up SD Cards can no longer be used to attack but can still be attacked by your opponent. They remain on the Battlefield until they have been defeated.<br/><br/>3. The DEFENDER is now given the chance to attack. Repeat steps 1 &amp; 2 with the DEFENDER now as the ATTACKER.<br/><br/>4) Repeat steps 1-3 until a player defeats an opponent&rsquo;s battleship. A player defeats their opponent&rsquo;s battleship by defeating 3 of their SD Cards thus sending them to the Discard Area. If there are not enough SD Cards on the Battlefield for a player to defeat 3 of their opponent&rsquo;s cards, the player who defeats more of their opponent&rsquo;s SD Cards wins the battle.<br/><br/>5) The winner sends their opponent&rsquo;s battleship back one space on the Command Board and moves their victorious battleship to the previously occupied space.<br/><br/>     If the losing battleship cannot move back a space due to another battleship obstructing its movement, the losing battleship is destroyed and removed from the Command Board.<br/>     If the losing battleship cannot move back because it is at the back (1st Row) of the Command Board, the losing battleship is destroyed and removed from the Command Board.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Assign Stage:<br/>Place one SD Card from your hand face down on any unoccupied space on the Battlefield. One Power Supply Point is required when placing an SD Card on the Battlefield.

That six-hour marathon game session started 15 minutes ago, and you have already killed a player character (PC)!  He was decapitated while being consumed in dragon fire, and his corpse fell into a sphere of annihilation.  Your prediction for recovery is &ldquo;not likely.&rdquo;  You built pre-generated characters for this campaign six months and four character levels ago!

You need a character sheet, right now.<br/><br/>Welcome to Instant Character!  Just add a player, and go!  In this product, you will discover twenty complete stat blocks for a single PC, level 1 through 20, adhering to the Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game rules.  The core format adheres to the standard non-player character (NPC) stat block most GMs are already familiar with minus the Tactics section.  This makes it easier for the GM to assist with finding information and also prepares the player for the day he or she is running games!  The Special Abilities section includes more detailed write-ups of feats and character abilities than a standard NPC stat block to facilitate faster play.  Sources for spells, races, classes, archetypes, and prestige classes from sources other than the Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook&trade; (PZO1110) are listed in the Sources section and can be referenced in the Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game Reference Document.<br/><br/>At the end of this document is a sheet of character and spell tokens including a token for this character and assorted Non-Player Characters (NPCs) and spell effects.  For best results, print the token page and laminate the entire sheet.  Initially cut out into squares.

You've walked its stalwart streets, tasted of its determined harvests, and have in turn sworn your life to its defense. Death does not frighten you near so much as the thought of Farrenroc falling to Darkness.<br/><br/>And now, here you stand&mdash;at the gates of the last city, facing the uncertain lands beyond. As the distant drumming heralds the encroaching Darkness, you steel your weapons and ready your courage for a final defense of your ancestral home. The dark frontier awaits...<br/><br/>Fight back the oppressive forces of Darkness in Myth: Dark Frontier, a fully cooperative board game for 2-4 players. Take on the role of an iconic Myth hero in a desperate fight to protect the city of Farrenroc from the legions of Darkness that seek to despoil its holy walls.<br/><br/>Heroes will have to travel, fight, and quest in defense of their city, while also establishing strongholds throughout the surrounding lands to provide crucial resources to Farrenroc. Each hero is equipped with a unique deck of action cards, providing unique ways to perform the standard actions...as long as Fate is on their side.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the forces of Darkness spread across the land, methodically crippling Farrenroc's influence in hopes of eventually laying siege to this last standing beacon of Light. Each game of Dark Frontier pits the heroes against a sinle army, contributing its own unique minions, captains, boss, and treacheries. Heroes must contend with these threats while also mustering the support of the land to unite against a mutual foe.<br/><br/>Dark Frontier combines high adventure with resource management, programmed action selection, and epic conquest to create a unique gaming experience to further enrich the world of Myth.<br/><br/>Players take on the role of iconic heroes from the world of Myth, aiding the besieged city of Farrenroc in its never-ending quest to push back the Darkness. Each hero has a small deck of five actions: Travel, Battle, Encounter, Fortify, and Quest. Three of the five are selected and placed in one of three time slots (morning, day, and night). These selections are made for all heroes and the enemy at the same time, then shuffled. Each time phase is played out by drawing and executing the action, be it a hero or an enemy. Oftentimes the timing of these actions is important to accomplish a quest or encounter, or to push back invading forces. Players will need to discuss their planned actions with each other and play them in the appropriate time slots.

Second, the game uses a very large 12-sided die with color-coded numbers: 1-4 are red; 5-8 are yellow; and 9-12 are green. Finally, players may only move counter-clockwise on the yellow and red tracks, and must move the opposite direction on green.<br/><br/>Players choose one of seven vehicles: train, plane, bus, car, scooter, bicycle and horse-drawn buggy, but their mode has no bearing on their speed. Each player roles the die and must move on that color track in the direction indicated. If this requires moving sideways to get to the right track, each such move counts against the total: so a player on the red track who rolls green 9 must first spend two points to go sideways to green and then 7 points clockwise.<br/><br/>Player counters block movement by other players, whether sideways or around the track. First player to pass town and then home wins.

The Rollcall deck, backed with stars on blue, contains a card for each state, showing an outline of the state, the cost of campaigning for the state, the number of electoral votes it provides, and one of eight symbols representing different power blocs. The Campaign Deck, with red and white striped backs, consists of five types of cards used to capture states: Campaign contributions (money), Splinter Party, Favorite Sun, Endorsement and Party in Power.<br/><br/>The state card deck is shuffled, and the first six states are laid on the table. Each player receives a hand of seven Campaign cards. On each turn, he uses his hand to take states either from the table or from other players. Once he has made as many moves as he desires and can afford, he ends his turn by drawing two more Campaign cards from the deck.<br/><br/>States on the table can be obtained by discarding campaign contributions greater than or equal to the campaign cost of the state. No change is provided. States can be taken from other players by using the other cards. Using Endorsement, a player must pay 1.5 times the normal cost to take a state from another player; using Favorite Son, he pays only the normal cost; and using Splinter Party, he pays only half the normal cost. The most powerful card is the Party in Power, which allows the taking of one state from each opponent for half their normal costs - but the player must take and pay for a state from each player.<br/><br/>The final element to strategy is the assembly of power blocs. When a player manages to assemble three or more states with the same symbol, he pays $1M per state and places them in front of him as a group. After that, only the top card is vulnerable to attack, and the attacker must pay double the normal cost.<br/><br/>Once the last state has been taken, electoral college votes are tallied and the player with the most votes wins.<br/><br/>"}, "200199": {"poll": [], "name": "Thomas The Tank Engine & Friends (Computer)", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Amstrad CPC Cassette (EDOS re-release) edition", "English/European Amstrad CPC Cassette edition", "English/European Atari ST 3.5\" disk edition", "English/European Commodore 64 Cassette (EDOS re-release) edition", "English/European Commodore 64 Cassette edition", "English/European Commodore Amiga 3.5\" disk edition", "English/European DOS 3.5\" disk edition", "English/European ZX Spectrum Cassette (EDOS re-release) edition", "English/European ZX Spectrum Cassette edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3026046.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Children's", "Commercial / Public Transport", "Movie, Book, TV show"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Enigma Variations Ltd.", "PeakStar Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "Amstrad CPC", "Atari ST", "Commodore 64", "DOS", "ZX Spectrum"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Alternative Software", "Electronic Distribution of Software (EDOS)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3026046_t.jpg", "description": "From the inlay:<br/><br/>It's full steam ahead once again for Thomas, he's had a busy week at the Station and now it looks likely this week is going to be just as busy.

The vessels featured within these pages are all warships used by The Hub Federation in Gypsy Knights Games&rsquo; Clement Sector setting.<br/><br/>The first vessel detailed here is the Kiviat-class patrol corvette.   The Kiviat-class is a patrol corvette designed and built by the Hub Federation to combat the local piracy problem.  Armed to the teeth and lightning fast, the Kiviat is more than capable of hunting down and destroying any pirates in the region.  At 600 tons, the Kiviat can make an ideal ship on which to set an adventure.  The ship could be used as the basis of a naval campaign, an enemy for those characters engaged in piracy, or a powerful personal ship for a group of hardcore adventurers.<br/><br/>The second vessel shown here is the Vulkan-class attack boat tender.  The Vulkan-class is a power projecting attack boat tender capable of carrying twelve deadly attack boats which the elite pilots of the Hub Federation Navy strive to be assigned.  The Vulkan and her dangerous squadrons of attack boats can make an ideal ship for adventure.  Vulkan can be used as the basis of an ongoing naval campaign, as the rescuing &quot;cavalry&quot; for characters in trouble, or as a fearsome adversary for your party of pirates.<br/><br/>The third ship featured is the mighty Moltke-class cruiser.  The Moltke-class cruiser is the largest ship in the Hub Federation navy and is currently the flagship of that force.  The ship is designed to destroy other large warships and act as a command ship for squadrons assigned to attack the fleets of other worlds if the need arises. The Moltke is an excellent ship for active navy campaigns, a perfect location for a diplomatic conference, a fearsome opponent or the ultimate warship to save the characters' lives if they are in peril.<br/><br/>While each of these ships has been specifically designed to fit into the Clement Sector setting, they could easily be used in other settings or within other science fiction RPGs if needed.<br/><br/>"}, "200256": {"rpgartist": ["Tom Baxa", "Joel Biske", "Kent Burles", "John Dollar", "Earl Geier", "Jennell Allyn Jaquays", "Jeff Laubenstein", "Larry MacDougall", "Mark A.

In the book Andi is sad, because he doesn't have grandmother. He retreats to the appletree, where he imagines all kind of zany adventures with an equally imaginatory and zany gandmother. Later on he meets his new neighbor Mrs. Fink, an elderly woman without grandkids, so in the end, he has two &quot;grandmothers&quot;. In the game the players try to help Andi tell Mrs Fink about his adventures with his grandma and then tell his mother about how he helped Mrs. Fink.<br/><br/>The game is played over 8 to 10 rounds, depending on playercount. Each player has a hand of three cards. In each round, the active player flips an apple token from the tree, revealing either grandma (green) or Mrs Fink (blue). Depending on the colour he tries to fulfil as many of the cards of that colour until a timer runs out. To fulfil a green card the player has to roll a certain combination with four coloured dice as fast as he can. To fulfil a blue card the player has to stack the dice in a certain way. Whenever the active player finishes a card in front of him, the next player in turnorder lays another one out in front of him and the active player continues.<br/><br/>Once the timer has run out the active player has to shut his eyes immediately. On each green card is a word, on each blue card a chore. So the active player either has to tell a story with the words on the green cards or recount the chores he did on the blue cards. He has to do both in order. Each card correctly remembered goes into a scoring pile. Once a mistake was made, the rest of the cards are put away, and the next player becomes active player. After the last turn all the saved cards are counted up, and the group can rate their score based on a scale. The goal is to save as many cards as possible for scoring.<br/><br/>"}, "200274": {"poll": [], "name": "Game Type", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Surreal"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Mommy's Best Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Action"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Mommy's Best Games"], "description": "A game in two parts: First, brave your way through a confusing maze of menus, then take to the air as the indefatigable &quot;Hoodie Girl&quot; and blast sentient advertisements into cold, hard cash!<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "200275": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder Roleplaying Game"], "poll": [], "name": "Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary 5 Box", "rpgartist": ["Dave Allsop", "Erta\u00e7 Altin\u00f6z", "Helge C.

Jack the Ripper mixes the interplay of party games like Werewolf and Mafia, the psychology of games like poker, and the action of games like your favorite collectible card game. On top of that, we fit all of this into a primer game that takes fifteen minutes or less to play!<br/><br/>The Characters<br/><br/>In Jack the Ripper, you play a character that has been attending an aristocrat's party in the year 1888. The main event of the party is a scavenger hunt and you and your group of fellow scavenger hunters are one item away from completing the hunt. The only problem is, you've been locked in a dark warehouse and one of your team mates is a celebrity known as The Whitechapel Murderer, Jack the Ripper.<br/><br/>Strategies<br/><br/>Players have used many strategies to get ahead in Jack the Ripper. Some have found ingenious card combinations that help them race to victory. Many have sat back quietly and watched while others are picked off one by one. A few have gotten deeply involved in questioning the other players, trying to sleuth out which one is Jack. Some industrious players have learned all of the character names and are quick to claim to be one of the other scavenger hunters, hiding the fact that they are really the Ripper himself.<br/>Jack the Ripper is mechanically easy to play and it doesn't take long to get through a game but it is dynamic enough to allow for many potential strategies in both the cards you play and the style in which you play them. So you choose, take a pot shot at one of your opponents or talk it out and then decide who to attack!<br/><br/>The World of Jack<br/><br/>So you are trapped in a dark warehouse and you know that one of your group members is the notorious Jack the Ripper, you just don't know which one. The closest thing you can grab to protect yourself is from the bag of scavenger hunt items that your group has collected. Using these items, the partygoers try to find out who is Jack and destroy him before he destroys all of them.<br/>If Jack can murder all of the partygoers before they murder him, Jack the Ripper wins the hunt and prowls on in infamy. If Jack falls first, then the remaining partygoers share in the victory and become the heroes of Whitechapel. But would be heroes beware, Jack has some tricks up his sleeve to help take you out.<br/><br/>Learn More at <a target='_blank' href='https://cryptmonkeygames.com/games/jacktheripper' rel='nofollow'>https://cryptmonkeygames.com/games/jacktheripper</a><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "13", "name": "Jack the Ripper", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": ["Player Elimination", "Take That"], "average": "7", "usersrated": "15", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Characters: Jack the Ripper", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Werewolf / Mafia"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Interview Special #6: Ty Rucker (Crypt Monkey Studios - Jack the Ripper)", "TRCP - Launch Episode 11"]}, "200315": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Too Much Slap on the Ecaf", "rpgdesigner": ["The Countess Dillymore"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3037702.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["History (Britain / Ireland)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpg": ["Too Much Slap on the Ecaf"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpgseries": ["Golden Cobra Challenge 2015"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3037702_t.jpg", "description": "Winner, Best Incorporation of Perspective of Unheard or Marginalized People or Groups, 2015 Golden Cobra Challenge.<br/><br/>From the Golden Cobra website:<br/><br/>In 1952 London, the tearoom trade blossoms.

They may place a bid on a playfield device (Steer towards it), spend one or more control tokens to increase the speed of their pinball and they may purchase a playfield card from the discard pile. They many do any or all of these options or pass and do none. The highest bidders on each device takes their card and, assuming they meet the speed requirements to complete the device, they score it. Anyone who did not bid on a device starting with the first player selects one of the remaining devices. Pinballs must be going the speed listed on the device they get or greater to score it. If they are not, it is not scored and they still lose speed according to the device. Devices that are scored affect speed and can cause your pinball to speed up or slow down depending on the device.

It takes place in the Mistfall universe, allowing players to once again take on the roles of iconic Heroes of both Mistfall and Heart of the Mists. Move, plot and fight competitively, cooperatively or solitaire, in a fast and furious mini dungeon crawler of epic proportions!<br/><br/>Each game is played on a five-by-five grid of dungeon room cards, randomized before every game. Players start by choosing their Heroes and placing their tokens in the corner rooms of the dungeon. Each Hero comes with their own set of four double-sided Action Cards placed on the table in front of the player.<br/><br/>During your turn, you will use two of those cards, performing Actions like attacking monsters (but not other Heroes), searching through rooms, moving or preparing for the next rounds. After using an Action Card, you will flip it to the other side, featuring a different Action.<br/><br/>Each Action can be boosted by using the Boon effects from any number of Fate Cards from your hand. Fate Cards are drawn from a common Fate Deck at different points of the game (usually when using the Prepare Action). But Fate Cards can also be used for their alternative Bane effect, which allows you to move monsters, make unexpected changes to the layout of the labyrinth, or snatch treasures from other players.<br/><br/>Each turn will end with the active player drawing one Fate Card for its third and final effect: monster spawn and movement. This is also the time when most monsters will be able to attack the Heroes, dealing damage some of which can be easily soaked, while other have to be placed on their Action Cards, making them unavailable until the Hero is healed.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "name": "Shadowscape", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Variable Player Powers"], "average": "7.01034", "usersrated": "29", "boardgameaccessory": ["Mistfall: Miniatures Pack"], "age": "13"}, "200360": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3139146.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jeff LaFlam"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2017", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": ["Rebecca McConnell"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3139146_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Zombies"], "description": "Zomburbs is the zombie apocalypse if it were to happen in your idyllic neighborhood. It is also an interactive deck-building game in which you shoot zombies, build your fort, buy loot, and ...ahem... &quot;help&quot; your neighbors, in order to thrive during the zombie apocalypse. We felt that the deck-building genre too often felt like a 4 person game of solitaire. Our aim is to evolve the genre and create a game where you might be scratching your opponent's back...just to stab it later.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to accumulate the most victory points in both your deck and your fort by the end of the game. Cards will have varying number of victory points and weapon cards are worth no victory points since you use them to earn higher victory point cards called cure cards. The game ends when either the wound or cure cards are exhausted.<br/><br/>At the end of each turn an increasing number of zombies will be added to a player's walls. Creatures stay behind your walls until they are either shot or if they overcome the strength of your wall. When creatures come over you walls you can end up taking wound cards which are worth a negative one victory point and they will hinder your deck a bit. There are ways to remove wound cards and there are not that many in a game so your deck will not be adversely affected by them.<br/><br/>There is a resource in the game that you can collect called scrap. It can be used in one of two ways. One you can use it to reinforce your walls, therefore preventing zombies from coming over and giving you wounds. You can also use it to construct buildings. Buildings are essentially abilities that you can use at least once per turn since they don't have to drawn from your deck, they are also worth a good amount of victory points. An example of one building is the zombie catapult which you can use to fling zombies on your walls towards other players.<br/><br/>If you help other players you can earn two different types of cards. One type is called consumables and they are one time burn cards that can either help you or mess with the other players. The other card you can earn are cure cards which are worth a decent number of victory points and provide the ability to easily kill creatures on your walls, therefore allowing you to continue to &quot;help&quot; other players.<br/><br/>The game is a &quot;take that&quot; game so players who prefer coop games might not enjoy the mechanics of messing with the other players. I spent a significant amount of time in making the cards that affect other players in a mild and fun way versus king maker or knocking somebody out. The game was intended to be very interactive so most abilities are centered on that. Alliances will be formed and broken throughout the game which makes it very dynamic each time.<br/><br/>There really is no trashing in this game so you only start with 5 cards. This allows a player to get to making fun card combos much sooner in the game. This also allows you to focus more on the type of strategy that you are going for in the game.<br/><br/>The cards for purchase in the tableau area are fairly unique with a maximum of 2 copies versus 10 of the same card that normal deck builders have. This gives each player a unique feel/identity each game. It also makes the replay value fun and fresh each time you play the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "5.5", "name": "Zomburbs", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Deck / Pool Building", "Take That"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The First Roll - What's New on Kickstarter? - Episode 69: Tuesday, September 27th"]}, "200362": {"rpgdesigner": ["Ed Buchman", "Dian Crayne", "Tom Digby", "Dick Eney", "Alan E.

A collection of pulp villains and monsters, and a range of pulp organizations provide the Keeper with a firm basis for running pulp style scenarios and campaigns. Four action-packed scenarios round out the book, getting your Pulp Cthulhu games started with a bang.<br/><br/>The guidance in this book means that you can apply the Pulp Cthulhu rules to any setting and time period, enabling Keepers to bring the flavor and action of pulp to the classic 1920s or modern-day eras, as well as anywhere they see fit.<br/><br/>A Time For Heroes And A Time For Adventure!<br/><br/>"}, "200376": {"rpgdesigner": ["Dan Alderson", "Greg Chalfin", "Dian Crayne", "Tom Digby", "Dick Eney", "Alan E.

Elements of a United States Marine Corps brigade are reported to have landed at the small town of French Village, west of Halifax, and are advancing on the city.<br/><br/>Canadians were summoned to defend their homeland by the newly-appointed Defence Minister, John E. Mitchell.<br/><br/>&quot;We will not permit these American scoundrels to pave our paradise and put up a parking lot,&quot; Mitchell warned. &quot;All true Canadians will rise to defend our unique culture and way of life in this, our country's hour of need.&quot; (Mitchell was shortly thereafter the subject of a Vote of Censure by the Legislative Assembly of Quebec for having failed to make his remarks in French.)<br/><br/>Meanwhile, all units of the Non-Permanent Active Militia in all Militia Districts have received mobilization orders, though transport and equipment are lacking. Volunteer battalions have spontaneously formed in Montreal and Halifax as university students, local police, townsmen and farmers band together to resist the invasion. And the majesty of the British Empire has begun to make itself felt: a battalion of British troops are reported to have arrived at Quebec City; even more encouraging are sightings of Royal Navy and American ships engaged in heavy exchanges of fire off Halifax.<br/><br/>/*** -30- ***/<br/><br/>WAR PLAN CRIMSON is a simulation game of a hypothetical invasion of Canada by the United States some time between 1935 and 1939. The game is for two players, one representing the leader of the armed forces of the United States that could be deployed against Canada (the US player) and the other representing the commander of the Canadian and British forces that would defend against a foreign invasion (the Commonwealth or CW player).<br/><br/>In reality, both countries have enjoyed cordial relations but it is also historical fact that the United States Army did make plans to invade Canada, in the context of the &lsquo;Rainbow&rsquo; war plans where potential enemy countries were referenced by colours (Japan was orange, Britain red, and Canada crimson - whence the title of the game).  In most cases these plans were created, studied and maintained in order to keep staff officers sharp, but the strategic priorities of an actual plan submitted for consideration in 1935 (seizing Halifax and Montreal in a quick campaign before Britain could intervene decisively) are the obvious ones and have been used as the basic framework for the action in this game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Tiny Battle edition"], "name": "War Plan Crimson", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "7", "usersrated": "1", "age": "12"}, "200384": {"poll": [], "name": "Rugby \u00e0 2", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "kako editions"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Sports"], "age": "9", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Rugby &agrave; 2 is a card game.

Although each player is competing with other players to win the game, collaboration, trust and and holistic approach to growth are quintessential to progressing in the game.

The water well is a key element of Granjeros gameplay as it influences all players in every turn and will determine the conditions for harvesting and selling crops.

But as we all know, physical strength is not enough. To win the Challenges you will need to let your stars drink cooked and blended dishes, so that every fiber of their organism can be pervaded by the right nutrients. Carbohydrates increase the strength, Fats increase the resistance, Proteins increase the coolness and Vitamins increase the charisma. Pay close attention, because the final victory will depend on your choices.<br/><br/>First of all each player gets 2 or 3 stars each (according to the number of players), revealing them.<br/>There are 2 stages: in the first one each player get some cards that represent dishes that have been blended with a drink. Each dish is divided into 5 ingredients. Players will place on the table 6 tokens (5 ingredients and 1 drink). All tokens are true (so they have a correspondence with those indicated on each card) but one, that is false. The opponents should guess whether an ingredient is true or false. They bet on one of theit choice thanks to their own double-faced token (1 side indicates TRUE, the other side indicates FALSE). Clearly betting on the false ingredient is harder, but it gives you a lot of rewards.<br/><br/>Betting on ingredients allow players to obtain nutrition cards, that can improve the basic values of the stars. Carbohydrates improve Strength, Fats improve Resistance, Proteins improve Coolness and Vitamins improve Charisma.<br/><br/>After all players played their dish cards allowing the opponents to guess ingredients and collect nutrition cards to assign to their stars, the stage 2 starts.<br/><br/>All stars will face 4 challenges: Strength, Resistance, Coolness and Charisma. Players reveals all cards of each challenge assigned to the stars. The character with the highest score gains 3 victory points, the second only 1. In case of tie all characters at the first position gain 2 VP, while all characters at the second one gain 1 VP.<br/>Then pass to the second challenge and so on. Each character, however, has a skill that can influence several moments of the game, making the results of the challenges always unpredictable.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the team's player with the highest rank (calculating the total amount of rewards of each star of his team) is the winner.

Planets evolve, grow and migrate in their orbits, forming a unique solar system by the end of every game. Planetarium is a game of creation, chaos and terraforming on the grandest scale.<br/><br/>Players are competing to crash combinations of elements onto planets that then allow them to play cards to evolve the planets in a variety of ways, with each player looking to evolve planets in the system to suit their own secret endgame goals.<br/><br/>On a turn a player will firstly move a matter or planet token in a clockwise direction around the star. The board is mapped with a series of lines, tracing orbits around the star, and it is along these lines that the tokens are moved. If a matter token moves onto a space occupied by planet token then the matter token is placed on the player's mat (on the respective planet). In the same way, planets can also be moved onto matter tokens, placing the matter tokens on the player's mat.<br/><br/>In the second part of a turn a player can play Evolution cards from their hand at the cost of the matter tokens they have collected on their player mat (some cards have other special requirements to play). If a player plays a card, they score the cards points and check to see if their card has changed the state of the planet from hostile to habitable by checking the total habitable and hostile points played to the planet (some end game goals require planets to be hostile or habitable). The player may then draw a card from one of three decks, Low Evolution (cards that score less points but require less matter to play), High Evolution (cards that score more and are harder to play), and Final Evolution (cards that can only be played on a player's final turn).<br/><br/>The thematics of the game have been developed with an eye on the science, led by a scientist working on NASA's search for life on Mars. Evolution cards thematically include all kinds of planetary phenomenon, from asteroid impacts, atmospheric effects, to geological events. Final Evolution cards mark the relatively stable state a planet is in at the end of the solar system's development and include classifications for the final planets such as Hot Jupiter or an uninhabitable frozen dwarf planet.<br/><br/>The game consists of a beautiful game board with handfuls of matter tokens, approximately 36 Evolution cards and 16 Final Evolution cards (all with unique space art and flavor), player mats, and player and score markers.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "7.40068", "name": "Planetarium", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Time Track"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["221886"], "usersrated": "279", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["30.
