Played on a board divided into 3 separate areas for temporal jumps (Giza, Egypt 2560 BC, Holy Roman Empire 1248 AD, and Central Europe 1945 AD), and 1 area where soldier reinforcements can be acquired by each team. Located in the center of the board is a time-travel port that transports soldiers through both time and space to engage in battles.<br/><br/>The primary object of the game for the Axis Powers is to finish their two-stage plot to rid the world of the human race in 1945, then time-travel to the future in 1946 to start a supreme human race. The primary object of the game for the Allies is to locate the time-travel port, battle Axis forces to gain control of it, and shut it down before the Axis Powers finish their two-stage plot. If either stage of the plot is finished, the dynamics of the game changes drastically with battles in both time and space.<br/><br/>Players control and move soldiers of different ranks and powers in an attempt to battle and control element cards used in the Axis Powers&rsquo; two-stage plot, with movement and battle results determined by dice rolls.

It was the year 1900. The game was coined &ldquo;Gombfoci&rdquo;, a rather self-explanatory term, which describes a game played with buttons from coats upon a kitchen table. It spread like wildfire and soon came to be well known in such far off lands as Spain, USA or Brazil. These people changed the rules and by this created a new game called &ldquo;12 Touches&rdquo;, which later became an even greater success than its predecessor. (Geraldo Cardoso D&eacute;court&rsquo;s, in 1928).<br/><br/>This game simulates football, the board it is a small football field and both players control a team of disks (or rings), and move them by flicking or pressing their edges, in order to hit a smaller disc (the ball) with them. The players need to score   by moving the ball into the goal. <br/>A match takes 20 minutes divided in 2 halves of 10 minutes each.<br/><br/>The game is turn-based, only the sector ball rule will change this. A turn normally consists of moving one of your buttons. The buttons have to slide on the table, but not by pushing or pulling. They can be moved by flicking or by pressing by the finger. The buttons cannot be lifted up and put elsewhere, only after goals and before goal-kicks, free kicks, penalties or corner kicks.<br/><br/>Sectorball actually means a valid pass in the football game. If you move a button and the ball stops close enough (maximum one button size) to another button controlled by you, then you get another turn.<br/><br/>The game is also suitable for solo play. The player then controls both sides. In this can be simulating whole world championships.<br/><br/>Players can play single matches, tournament based matches, league or swiss system.<br/><br/>We are moving the two games in one box.

Players take on the role of one of 5 different heroes working together to defeat the Darkness. Each hero has a different skill set which represented by a unique deck of cards. Players spend Action Points by using cards. Once a certain amount of Action Points have been spent the Darkness fights back by activating monster lairs, spawning monster captains and eventually the Boss.<br/><br/>A complete game in Myth is called a Story. Each Story is played over three Acts. Acts can be played sequentially, or can be split up over three different game sessions.<br/><br/>Players' avatars within a Story are called Heroes. Myth Heroes are clothed in immense power, able to reave all but the mightiest foes. However, this power must be balanced lest the Darkness take too much notice. Players must weigh their actions against the Threat each will bring, with the consequences of awakening more evil and bringing doom on the party's endeavors. And be careful they must, as the Darkness is formidable and eager to snatch glory from the valiant.<br/><br/>Heroes are controlled through an intuitive Hero Deck (videos for each Hero can be found in the Game Play Videos section below).

Players must communicate, interact, and assist each other or surely the Darkness will cover all.<br/><br/>Myth is a fully cooperative game. There is no player controlling the Darkness. The Darkness is governed by a set of rules unique to each Boss Deck and is activated through Hero actions. If the Heroes get overzealous, then the Darkness pushes back by activating Lairs, spawning Captains, and punishing the Heroes with devious Events. If the Heroes take a more subtle approach, then the Darkness reacts by reducing the potential for treasure and rewards. Without the treasures and equipment to upgrade, the Heroes will find each Act more difficult and eventually fail. The dynamic nature of the Darkness really lends a more fluid feel to the Story. Players aren't being driven by properties out of their control, nor are they being shepherded by a person whose skill has a direct impact on the enjoyment of the game.<br/><br/>Myth is a fun fantasy romp where players feel truly heroic. In the playing of the game, the players are creating their own mythos. These stories are the ones carried away from the table, becoming myths themselves.

Use your actions to explore your surroundings, overcome guards, or change the layout of the prison itself - just be careful that the moves you make to save yourself don't doom a teammate!<br/><br/>In the year 2083, an alien race known as the Loctae descended on planet Earth, killing billions and capturing and containing the few million that remained. The survivors were sent to locations throughout the galaxy, to work as slaves or as subjects for genetic experiments. The most infamous of these locations, known as the Hive, is a Loctae space station orbiting Ganymede. Here, prisoners are harvested for their genetic material, which is used by the Loctae to make genetic hybrids engineered for aptitude in any skill the Loctae require. A few have tried to escape, but none have succeeded. Those who are not lost in the station's labyrinthine halls are recaptured by the station's guards and then moved to the front of the list of those who are to be processed. The failed escapees blabber about the twisted and spliced creatures that roam the corridors of the maze, as if they were in the Labyrinth of King Minos. The remaining survivors now call their plight &quot;The Daedalus Sentence&quot;, a grim tribute to the facility's designer.<br/><br/>As the months in The Hive wear on, fewer and fewer prisoners remain. Fearing their subjects would run out before their experiments were completed, the Loctae have confined the remaining prisoners in regenerative pods, so that the organs and marrow taken from the prisoners will regenerate with time. Though expensive, this set up was proving successful for the Loctae until a rogue meteor struck the station, damaging the ship's AI and releasing the bonds that kept the prisoners contained. Now the prisoners have a chance, likely the last one they'll ever have, to brave the halls of The Hive and escape to freedom.<br/><br/>The main feature of the game is its rotating board. The board has four rotating rings, with players starting in the center prison cells and making their way to the outer ring, where they must find the final exit to make their escape. When players start the game, the entire board will be hidden. As they move from the start location, they need to spend actions to flip over tiles in order to discover the layout of each ring. Their main objective is to find the gate to the next ring, but as they explore they will discover tiles both beneficial and perilous. The tiles may allow them to influence the movement of enemies or the maze itself, but they may also spawn additional enemies that will hunt for the players until subdued. If the players can make their way through all four rings, find the final exit, and escape together, they win!<br/><br/>Enemies will spawn throughout the course of the game, both as the result of exploring tiles and from drawn cards. Unlike many card-driven games however, the players have a glimpse into their future by way of the Theseus Device, which holds eight cards that determine how the rings and enemies will move in coming rounds. All eight cards start hidden, but through die rolls (and cards played from the hands of players in case of emergency), players see some of the cards to come. This allows for careful planning, as players try to anticipate how rings will line up in future rounds, as well as making sure they are not caught in the patrol of any passing enemies. When the game starts, only two cards will be activated per round, but as the players breach additional rings, the number of cards that will activate increases. When playing the recommended timed game difficulty enhancer, this leads to a frantic rush as players try to evade enemies and find the exit while planning ahead for the next activation sequence.<br/><br/>The Daedalus Sentence is designed to be played at a variety of difficulty levels, and players can mix-and-match the optional difficulty enhancers to achieve the perfect intensity level for their group. In addition to a four player co-op game, The Daedalus Sentence can also be played one-versus-all, with a player taking the role of the labyrinth and its minions.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "name": "The Daedalus Sentence", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Co-operative Play", "Hand Management", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "average": "6.9664", "usersrated": "125", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 030b \u2013 Essen 2016", "Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 037 \u2013 Top 10 Publishers", "Episode 13 - Techno Bowl Review And Brent Spivey Interview", "Episode 32 - The Essen Games We Have to Have", "MN 0140 Hot Games and News from BGG.Con 2016", "The Game Pit: Episode 74 - Spiel \u201816 Treasure Hunt Part 4"]}, "140525": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2005259.png", "boardgameimplementation": ["Cards Against Humanity: Geek Pack"], "poll": [], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "30", "age": "17", "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2005259_t.png", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Humor", "Mature / Adult", "Party Game"], "description": "Cards Against Humanity PAX East 2013 Promo Packs A, B, and C were released as promotional expansions for Cards Against Humanity at the Penny Arcade Expo East 2013 convention.

More than that, it was forgotten, the minds of those alive scoured clean of knowledge, history, and identity. In the intervening years, society has rebuilt as best it could, new alliances have been forged and blood-sworn enemies made as the surviving nations have begun to rediscover their roots. Out in the wilds and darkness, however, not all that lurks is friendly...or human...or even alive.<br/><br/>Things are said to lurk in the wilds of the Frontier. Large beasts roam the woodlands, evidence unnaturally large wolves and dogs are found outside campsites. And, it is said, during the nights of the full moon, inhuman screams can be heard followed by the most awful baying as the moon peeks beyond the clouds... <br/>It is also said that, under the skin of all humans lies a beast. Some faiths would have you believe that this is not only natural but to be embraced. The Beast is not something to be feared but something to be cherished... <br/>The Wyre of Shadowglade introduces a new element to the realm of Shadowglade. While humans rule the cities, they have yet to tame the wild lands of places such as the Frontier and, possibly, they have yet to tame themselves. Introduce the Wyre to your own gaming table in or out of Shadowglade! This PDF features<br/><br/>     Background on the Wyre of Shadowglade! Just who are these people? Beasts or more?

Mimeowands remember the identity of the last spell its owner has cast. Accordingly, it becomes a wand of that spell until another spell is cast, at which point it copies THAT spell instead! Careful planning will allow for extension of a caster's favorite spells. Poor planning will result in swearing.<br/><br/>Spellswallower - A classic concept tweaked and rebalanced the Interjection Games way, this keen shortsword has the ability to absorb the spells of those it strikes, thus giving its master the ability to cast those spells himself.

Unlike most subterranean races, the puddlings accept outsiders and their stories of the world beyond the corpse of their god with great enthusiasm. Highly cognizant of the fact that other races are much more similar to each other than they are to them, Puddlings go to great lengths to attempt to artificially induce homogeneity between any visitors and themselves, often with humorous results. Their drive for new experiences, even in a geographically constrained existence such as theirs, propels the puddling race forward, inspiring grand adventures and grand invention.<br/><br/>The best test for determining a veteran Dungeons and Dragons player is as follows: walk up to him and whisper, &quot;Gelatinous Cube!&quot; If you need to cover your face from any reflexive attack brought upon you, the test comes out positive. Given this, what better way is there to mix things up for even the most veteran D&amp;D player than subjecting that player to an entire race of sentient, neutral good oozes that will force his reflex to go into the background and treat those oozes as people? That's what I thought.<br/><br/>Subterranean Races: The Puddlings introduces the puddling race, their backstory, and everything necessary to add the puddlings to your game as a balanced and playtested player race.

One Rule Set!<br/><br/><br/>What is the Pangenre RPG?<br/><br/>The Pangenre RPG Core Rules are the centerpiece of the Pangenre RPG System, a true multi-genre role-playing game. If you are yearning for a system that feels more realistic than existing designs, yet is still as playable as the easiest in-depth RPG system, Pangenre is for you!<br/><br/>Pangenre is built from Open Game Content as defined in the Open Game License (OGL). This makes it easier for experienced players to assimilate sweeping changes to the character and combat systems. But Pangenre is not just another d20 clone or spin-off. It's a brand-new game system.<br/><br/>The Open Game &quot;core mechanic&quot; remains intact. Decide on your action, roll dice, add modifiers, and compare to the target DC. So if you know how to play Open Game rules, you're already halfway to learning Pangenre!<br/><br/><br/>What Kind of Games Can I Run with Pangenre?<br/><br/>Pangenre allows you to place your game in almost any setting you can imagine. It includes equipment for archaic, modern, and futuristic scenarios. Additional supplements will address, among other things, magic and supernatural phenomena and related skills.<br/><br/>Archaic Scenarios<br/>Anything set prior to the 20th Century can be played with Pangenre, from Homeric epics to Renaissance swordplay to Victorian era imperial adventures to Old West shootouts.<br/><br/>Modern Scenarios<br/>The 20th and 21st Centuries are your playground with Pangenre. Weapons and armor spanning the centuries are presented for your use. Kevlar works as Kevlar should. (And frankly, don't get in a gunfight without it!)<br/><br/>Future Scenarios<br/>From the coming Mayan apocalypse to Humankind's eventual forays into the depths of space, the Core Rules have enough material to allow you play most science-fiction scenarios you can conceive. The Core Rules include equipment for futuristic scenarios such as envisioned by Niven and Whedon, along with such standards as laser weapons, gauss weapons, EMP weapons, as well as futuristic armor and force fields to protect you from them. Futuristic skills are easy because most are extensions of modern skills, and we have integrated ideas such as direct computer interfaces and EVA.<br/><br/>Mixed Scenarios<br/>Time travel and multi-dimension scenarios are a snap with Pangenre. The Core rules give you archaic, modern, and future equipment and weapons to adventure across the far reaches of time and space without having to change your rules with each dimension jump.<br/><br/>Converting from d20/Open Game Rules<br/>The Core Rules contains a chapter on how to convert your existing d20 games to Pangenre. (The chapter is a free download on our website.)<br/><br/>Supernatural Elements<br/>The Core Rules do not include rules for magic or supernatural powers. They are published separately in the Pangenre RPG Magic supplement, which will be available presently (est. Late October 2010).<br/><br/><br/>Features<br/><br/>Pangenre has many unique features, including:<br/><br/>     A simple hit location system that does not bog down the flow of combat, making combat more realistic without sacrificing fun.<br/>     Consistent mechanics. Combat, skills, and other checks use the same basic procedure and terminology, making it easier to learn.<br/>     Simple, yet realistic, language rules that use standardized skill concepts, are very simple to use, and fit as easily with scenarios where literacy is rare as with modern scenarios where you can learn to type and to read Braille.<br/>     A skill system in which you can specialize in areas of knowledge or gain competencies in esoteric equipment with ease. Playable, pregenerated characters from different genres show you how to craft characters for any setting.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Improvements over Open Game Rules<br/><br/>The Pangenre RPG has many enhancements to the Open Game rules, such as:<br/><br/>     A brand-new character system completely replaces the Open Game concepts of levels and classes with skill-based mechanics.<br/>     Revised Ability scores that add new dimensions to characters such as Perception. Old geezers will no longer hear a pin drop by virtue of their high Wisdom.<br/>     Reducing the gaminess of other systems by eliminating hit points entirely. Instead, when you are struck by an attack, you make a wound check that is influenced by factors such as your overall strength and your armor. There is a limit to how many wounds you can take, and there is always the possibility that powerful blow can take down a mighty character. No more, &quot;Have the high hit point warrior run through the minefield,&quot; cheese!<br/>     Replacing the attack-of-opportunity mechanic with a reaction rule that fits much better in scenarios where firearms, especially modern or futuristic firearms, are in play.<br/>     The relationship between weapons and armor is much more realistic. Rather than prevent you from being struck by attacks, armor mitigates damage.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "140571": {"rpgartist": ["Joseph J.

The game's plot centers on investigating the sudden disappearance of planet Earth, by venturing out into the universe from a moon base. There are two main play modes: real-time exploration and combat using various spacecraft, and turn-based exploration, problem solving, and combat on the surface of dozens of planets. The game features a variety of objects, weapons, and missions, though it lacks any detailed experience or stats system for the four characters the player controls.<br/><br/>Just prior to the start of the game, a mysterious alien spaceship approaches the Earth to conduct an experiment which goes terribly wrong and causes the Earth to disappear into a wormhole trap. A scientific research team based on the Moon determines that the only way to bring the Earth and all its inhabitants back involves recreating this failed experiment. Unfortunately, the experimental apparatus, called the Centauri Drive, has been destroyed in this accident. Nonetheless, Moonbase scientists are able to salvage enough technology from the wrecked alien craft to construct their own rudimentary spaceship. A four member scientific team commanded by the player is put together to find and obtain the parts necessary to rebuild the Centauri Drive and thereby save the Earth. This is the primary goal of the game.<br/><br/>The story begins in our solar system, but the fictional setting encompasses over a hundred stars and their associated planets and civilizations in the surrounding galaxy. The game world divides the interstellar space surrounding the Sun into eight sectors characterized by particular alien civilizations possessing varying degrees of technological sophistication. Each of the eight sectors is associated with a particular subplot which must be solved in order to gain access to each of the eight pieces necessary to complete the construction of the Centauri Drive.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Planet's edge&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "140583": {"rpgdesigner": ["Scott Casper", "Skeeter Green"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Castle Baldemar's Dungeon (Pathfinder)", "rpgartist": ["Rowena Aitken", "Robert Altbauer"], "rpgproducer": ["Dawn Fischer", "Bill Webb", "Charles Wright (I)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1614745.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Frog God Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Saturday Night Special"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1614745_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>While in the small town of Corvusrook, the characters are accosted by the mage Framnagle.

He&rsquo;ll expect the same in return, of course. Uncle Honk likes to taunt zombies every once in a while, to get in a &ldquo;funny&rdquo; during a fight. With his blood-chilling laugh, Uncle Honk is both your best friend and your worst nightmare.<br/><br/>Butch<br/><br/>After graduation, Butch held down a deadend job for a while before embracing the biker life. For him, it wasn&rsquo;t really about the one percenter life, but more about getting some freedom of choice, a little room to breath in a constricted world. Better to die young with stories to tell than as a senile fool in a gloomy hospital, right? Living on the edge taught Butch a useful trick or two that let him survive when the zombies invaded.

Then the second highest player selects one of the remaining cards, and so on, until each player took one card. There will be one card left behind on the star point.

The board is made up of many different planets currently inhabited by biological lifeforms. Each players starts with their own planet, some units, and some generators. As generators produce more units and currency, you will expand to different plants and destroy the inhabitants. Currency can be used to buy upgrades, more generators, and tech cards. Tech cards allow you to modify the moves you take, some will even give you the power to destroy entire planets.<br/><br/>This is a game of pure strategy; there are no dice rolls, random card draws, or any form of luck. Combat is resolved with a calculation of attack and defensive power, and these powers can be improved throughout the game.

The Survivors must defend four key locations from Walkers &ndash; the Farm, the Prison, the Town and the Highway &ndash; in order to stay alive. The game board is assembled at random for each game, providing for variability in the locations; a 25-card resource deck &ndash; containing either Equipment, Allies, Food or Ammunition &ndash; is placed at random on one of the locations.<br/><br/>Walkers and other calamities are triggered in different locations by a 48-card Event deck (every card is unique!), which players draw from each round. They must then figure out how to minimize the effects of these Events, using dice to resolve combat and determine the outcome of some events. Survivors can work together to combine their combat abilities or split up to cover more ground. If the Survivors don't clear the Walkers out of a location, they'll lose resources &ndash; and if any resource deck runs out, the players lose the game. Thus, players need to keep the Walkers at bay while not using up too many resources themselves.<br/><br/>Unlike most cooperative games, The Walking Dead Board Game: The Best Defense includes a leadership role that a player can take for one or more rounds. Each player character has a unique leadership ability that provides a bonus while that character is in charge.<br/><br/>The Walking Dead Board Game: The Best Defense includes two gameplay modes. In the &quot;Beginner&quot; mode, players share all information on their Event cards so that the leader and others can take everything happening in the game into consideration.

Why would they do this?<br/><br/>In addition to just trying to stay alive, each player has a secret &quot;Ulterior Motive&quot; card that specifies a mission for that player.

There are five classes from which players can choose their skills. Teamwork is encouraged by offering those skills with better perks if players stay within one class. Even new players can beat heists on Deathwish (hardest difficulty) with the right strategy.<br/><br/>Some heists can be finished in less than 50 seconds (Ukrainian Job on Overkill) or even 20 seconds (Jewelry Store on Normal).<br/><br/>"}, "140670": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Indrek Klanberg"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Pactio", "playingtime": "210", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Simulation", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1675546_t.png", "boardgameartist": ["Maarja Andla"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "(Web published)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1675546.png", "boardgameversion": ["First Print and Play edition"], "maxplaytime": "210", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Medieval", "Print & Play"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "210", "description": "In Pactio all players build the same city.

This included a coalition of Russia, Prussia and Austria committed to defeat France and its allies, forging a domination of Europe that would lead to the Nationalism of Germany. While historians have drawn a myriad of contrary opinions about who were the good guys and bad guys, the battle encircles the city of Leipzig with 500,000 man armies facing each other.<br/><br/>La Bataille de D&ouml;litz 1813 occured on October 16h, when forces under G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de Division Kaminieki (Polish) and General Lefol (French) defended the line along  the Pleisse River. The river was murky and swollen from previous weeks of rainfall. Men and horses could cross the river only in a few places. These crossings were at Connewitz and D&ouml;litz. Part of the 26e Polish division defended the intact bridge at D&ouml;litz with its manor house guarding the entrance.<br/><br/>This is the area that Schwarzenberg choose to lead an assault to outflank Napoleon&rsquo;s army. Therefore Schwarzenberg committed substantial Austrian troops to this assault.While outnumbering the French and Polish forces, General der Kavallerie Graf Merveldt&rsquo;s 2nd Army Abteilung found forcing either crossing a major problem. Unable to deploy his artillery because of the swampy ground, his infantry fought a battle of attrition with an enemy in built-up areas or on the other side of a major river.<br/><br/>Merveldt has been assigned one thing however that may assist him in getting across. He has the two army pontoon and two pioneer companies. They can be used to throw a bridge across the Pleisse or repair the bridge at Connewitz. The player will note immediately the differences in the different formations and how each must be managed to achieve success.<br/><br/>Each 20 minute turn starts with a Command Phase for both sides followed by the French Player sequence and then by the Coalitian Player sequence. The sequence includes movement, cavalry charges, fire and melee. During each, morale plays a decisive role. This is a great one player on one player game but will also accommodate two players on a side also.<br/><br/>The original rules have been updated, but not expanded to any extent.

Days of Honor: Operation Wildhorn III &ndash; is a fast-paced, tactical card wargame for two players. The first player takes the role of the Polish commander.

The second player takes the role of the German commander and is trying to protect the secrets of the rocket testing area.<br/><br/>The game lasts four turns. Each turn begins with a missile test, which scatters new fragments of the rocket in the peripheral area surrounding the testing ground. Players alternately take turns during which they place their units on the table and perform actions. Players use scouts to collect missile fragments, but they need to be protected by soldiers and partisans because enemy contact can lead to combat. These actions are supported by elite units: Polish Unseen and Silent commandos and German SS Stormtroopers, who are able to penetrate enemy lines. In addition, players build a network of command and support units, which allows them to effectively carry out their actions.<br/><br/>Players also affect the course of the game during their opponent's moves, playing cards for immediate effects. And each side has a set of unique events, e.g., Germans can use their logistical advantages while Poles can hide, and even evacuate rocket fragments to England! To determine combat and exploration results, players each use a six-sided die, but they have many opportunities to modify the results, so a good plan should work even with bad luck.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the player with more rocket parts wins.

With a small boat you will have to face the storm in shallow waters, but with a bigger boat and an experienced crew you'll be able to defy the waves and venture into the eye of the storm to catch a larger quantity of King Crab. But beware, every time the wave size is greater that your ship's stability, you will roll the danger die and see whether you ship capsizes.<br/><br/>Perfect Storm: Alaska is a game of risk management and every player will have to calculate his decision to fish for the most valuable prey without exposing his crew and cargo to unnecessary danger.

Yet consider them again, in light of a horror-themed campaign. These are not creatures but things, soulless, pitiless, without fear, judgment, or mercy, brought to a horrifying mockery of life by forces beyond comprehension. Their animus bound unwilling by the eldritch experimentation of madmen, the accursed invocations of apostate heretics, or risen into being by the tormented hauntings of spirits unable to rest and unwilling to forget or forgive the miseries they suffered or perpetrated in life. And what of those constructs that are not mindless at all but possessed of a malign and calculating intellect that makes them all the more hateful of those that live. These are what constructs can be in a horror game, or when used to evoke the themes of horror in any campaign, and within the Construct Codex you will find 11 new constructs and variants along with optional rules for creating and using constructs as instruments of terror in your game.<br/><br/>Designed by Jason Nelson with the Legendary Games design team of Neil Spicer, Greg A. Vaughan, Clinton J. Boomer, and Clark Peterson, with amazing illustrations by Colby Stevenson and Jason Juta. Who better to provide you with creepy constructs and alternate rules for creating and using them in your Adventure Path campaign than the very writers of those adventures themselves? Answer: no one. Legendary Games' Adventure Path Plug-Ins supplement and enrich your campaign experience, offering adventures and supporting products that incorporate and expanding upon unique concepts, themes, and rules subsystems introduced in the Adventure Paths while filling in the background characters, items, and locations that make those adventures come alive in delightful (and often dangerous) detail.

He's got a fondness for loud Hawaiian shirts, and may make small sidetrips into stores looking for fresh ones to add to his wardrobe.<br/><br/>Rob<br/>After decades as an anti-intrusion expert, testing security systems the world over, Rob reluctantly retired to a life of idyll on a sunny beach.

Harriman and originally published by Godax for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron.<br/><br/>The game is set on a single screen with several platforms. The screen wraps around so if the player or an enemy exits one side of the screen, they reappear on the other. At the bottom is a fiery pit of lava covered by two bridges (these get burned away in later levels creating an additional hazard for the player).<br/><br/>Pads on the platforms spawn knights sitting astride flying ostrich-like birds. The player controls one of these knights and can control movement with left, right and flap keys. Repeatedly pressing the flap key causes the mount to fly higher. Each knight carries a lance and when two collide, the lower-flying knight is killed. For the player, this results in the loss of a life. When enemies are killed their mount drops an egg. Eggs need to be collected, partly to collect points, but also because if the egg is left too long, it hatches into a new knight which is picked up by a replacement mount ready to re-enter the fray. Killing all the enemy knights on a level allows the player to advance to the next stage.<br/><br/>Each stage has slightly different rules, which include survival waves, where the player earns bonus points for not losing a life during the stage, egg waves, where the enemy knights do not start on their mounts, and others.<br/><br/>Each stage has a time limit. At the time limit, an &quot;unbeatable&quot; Pterodactyl enters the screen who kills the player on contact. The player must kill all the remaining enemies on-screen before being killed by the Pterodactyl.<br/><br/>In the two player game, both players are on-screen at the same time. Some levels are cooperative, others are competitive, where additional points are scored for not killing or killing your fellow player respectively.<br/><br/>"}, "140769": {"poll": [], "name": "Play It Again Sam 12", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["BBC Master 3.5\" Disk edition", "BBC Micro / Electron Cassette edition", "BBC Micro and Master Series 5 1/4\" disk edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1619863.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Play It Again Sam"], "videogametheme": ["Crime", "Fantasy", "Medieval", "Sports - Boxing"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Alligata Software, Ltd", "Godax", "Superior Software (UK)", "System 3"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Action Adventure", "Arcade", "Beat 'em Up", "Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["BBC Micro"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Superior Software (UK)"], "videogamecompilation": ["Blagger", "By Fair Means or Foul...", "The Last Ninja", "Skirmish"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1619863_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>This is the twelfth release in Superior Software's popular series of Play It Again Sam compilations.<br/><br/>It includes four games:<br/><br/>The Last Ninja - An action-adventure where the user plays a lone Ninja intent on revenge over an evil Shogun and his followers.<br/>By Fair Means Or Foul - A boxing simulator with the added feature that you can chet if the ref's not looking!<br/>Skirmish - A Joust clone<br/>Blagger - Described as a 'much-improved' version of the classic Alligata Software game where you play a thief collecting keys on each level to allow a safe to be opened.<br/><br/>"}, "140771": {"poll": [], "name": "The Resistance: Merlin/Assassin Promo", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "5", "boardgamemechanic": ["Role Playing", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2013", "boardgameexpansion": ["The Resistance"], "usersrated": "199", "boardgamefamily": ["Dystopian Universe"], "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1625597_t.jpg", "average": "7.48291", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Indie Boards & Cards"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1625597.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Deduction", "Expansion for Base-game", "Spies/Secret Agents"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A two card promotional expansion for The Resistance.

We want them to have toys. But when we gathered the freelancers at the clubhouse (saltines are free, but bring your own beverage.

We thought we could try making our scary face at them to intimidate them into genius creativity, but we have been told in the past that our scary face looks like a mildly peeved newspaper delivery boy, so that wasn&rsquo;t really going to get us anywhere. Besides, we like to offer carrots instead of sticks whenever possible. Though as we thought more about it, the whole concept of sticks seemed alluring. Maybe we could beat them into creativity!<br/> So we set about them, making sure to work the torso and not leave any marks on their beautiful faces. After a while they started complaining that they&rsquo;d really like to lie down for a while, so I broke out the sleeping bags and had them settle down on the clubhouse floor. I hoped that once they woke up, the genius would start flowing.<br/> As you&rsquo;ll see in these pages, our hopes were well and truly met&mdash;and then some. While this compilation may be slightly shorter than rigger books of past editions, we think you&rsquo;ll agree that no rigger book in the history of Shadowrun has presented a series of vehicles and drones quite like this one.

January 16, 2010<br/><br/>The clinic creation system here allows players to simulate the day to day operations of an embattled abortion clinic in the war-torn future of 2107 CE. It allows characters playing Neo-Witch Midwives and Covenguards a chance at a different kind of heroism: away from the battlefields and black ops of most cyberpunk roleplaying games but no less dangerous, no less necessary and no less courageous.<br/><br/>This system abstracts the running of a clinic down to a few die rolls. The abortion clinic is treated as a character in its own right- the clinic has a set of statistics, which influence the results of special skill checks made to operate the clinic and meet the challenges, both moral and military, posed by the 22nd century&rsquo;s viscous and fanatical Lifer Nation.<br/><br/>Frontlines of Choice was originally conceived as an adjunct (or plug-in) system for D20 Modern, and it still works well as such. The gamemaster can use the Frontlines system to generate plot points for a clinic the players have an emotional stake in. Depending on how interested the players seem in the plot hook offered by the weekly event roll, the game master can either roleplay the challenge out using the full D20 Modern rules, or just abstract it down to a few checks. Also, clinic events can be played out in the background- using the Frontlines system, the game master can easily track the ongoing story of one or even dozens of Choicer clinics. This system can generate plot hooks, or it can generate headlines, or crises for the heroes to solve after the fact- after the staff of one of these clinics fails a check, only then do the player characters become involved. The choice is yours.<br/><br/>In addition, Frontlines of Choice is a completely stand alone quick-play resource management game. Frontlines gives gamers a different way to play out the struggles described in the Otherverse America core rulebook. Faster, more focused on problem solving and community than combat, Frontlines offers a different view of the Abortion War, one that focuses on the physicians caught in the crossfire, not the superheroes flying overhead&hellip;.<br/><br/>"}, "140851": {"rpgartist": ["V.

The game is set to be released September 10th, 2013.<br/><br/>It will be playable in both traditional 2D and in 3D. Gavin Moore says Puppeteer plays better in 3D than other games because the camera doesn&rsquo;t move and his team used a method of 3D that hasn&rsquo;t resulted in a reduced frame-rate.<br/>The player controls a boy named Kutaro, who has been turned into a puppet and had his head torn off. Kutaro also wields a pair of magical scissors named Calibrus, which can be used to attacking enemies, cutting objects in the background to reveal secrets and advance further into the game. Another notable feature of the game is its unique control scheme, more specifically the use of the analog sticks. While the left analog stick is used to control Kutaro, the right analog stick is used to control a ghostly cat named Ying Yang.

During play, players will collect &quot;Quest&quot; cards, which challenge them to travel to specific mysterious locations on the board and confront special monsters there.  Doing so earns them gemstones, and they need three to enter the castle to challenge the Chimera.  If a player rolls a &quot;1&quot; on the movement die, a strength token is added to the Chimera, and if the Chimera gets 11 tokens, it wins.<br/><br/>The game includes a simple advancement system for the characters; the players earn money for defeating enemies, and they can spend that money in the training hall to buy new skills for their characters.<br/><br/>Combat is handled with a simple die roll.  Each monster has a target roll the player must hit; rolling the target number or higher harms the monster, rolling below harms the player's character.  Once characters have advanced their skills, they can start to roll two or more dice instead of just one to see if they can roll a die that meets or beats the target number.<br/><br/>If the players manage to get into the castle and defeat the Chimera before it gets 11 tokens, they win.<br/><br/>"}, "140896": {"poll": [], "name": "Naval Interceptor Squadron", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Windows edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1627429.jpg", "videogametheme": ["War - World War II"], "usersrated": "0", "videogameexpansion": ["Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2: WWII Pacific Theater"], "videogamedeveloper": ["AeroSim"], "videogamegenre": ["Flight Simulator"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["AeroSim"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1627429_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A collection of new and replacement Japanese aircraft for Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2.

The balance of the Force turns to the dark side in Escape from Hoth as it gains three of the Force Pack's five new objective sets, including one that introduces the Super Star Destroyer, Executor. However, even as the dark side looks to deploy this incredible Vehicle and hunt down the rag-tag remnants of the Rebellion with hired bounty hunters, the light side isn't yet ready to concede defeat. Light side players can take hope from the arrival of several iconic new units, including a new Rebel Alliance version of Han Solo!<br/><br/>At the end of &quot;The Hoth Cycle&quot;, the siege on Echo Base and the cycle's focus on the Hoth trait come to a dramatic close. Will this Force Pack see the end of the Rebel Alliance and its allies? Or will Luke, Leia, Han, and the light side's other key champions escape from the frozen planet to plan their next strike and keep the fires of freedom lit?<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Chinese first edition", "Dutch first edition", "English first edition", "French edition", "German first edition", "Italian first edition", "Korean first edition", "Polish first edition", "Spanish first edition"], "average": "7.80171", "name": "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Escape from Hoth", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["Star Wars: The Card Game"], "usersrated": "175", "boardgamefamily": ["Living Card Game", "Star Wars", "Star Wars: The Card Game LCG"]}, "140917": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1639537.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Nate French", "Caleb Grace", "Lukas Litzsinger"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Sara Biddle", "Jon Bosco", "Trudi Castle", "Sidharth Chatursedi", "Rafa\u0142 Hrynkiewicz", "Aur\u00e9lien Hubert", "Milek Jakubiec", "Igor Kieryluk", "Yigit Koroglu", "Jake Murray", "Jim Pavelec", "Oleg Saakyan", "Magali Villeneuve", "Jason Ward", "Sandara Tang Sin Yun", "Darek Zabrocki"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Edge Entertainment", "Fantasy Flight Games", "Galakta", "Giochi Uniti", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1639537_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy", "Novel-based"], "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>&quot;Come not between the Nazg&ucirc;l and his prey!&quot;<br/>    &ndash;J.R.R.

Criteria was to use up to 20 playing cards and 10 game cubes and nothing else.<br/><br/>To play, all you need are the A-9 in 2 suits from a deck of cards and 10 game cubes. Each player gets a suit and organizes the cards according to rankings.<br/><br/>On your turn, place the number of cubes equal to the card number in play onto the table/floor. Organize the cubes to mimic the pattern of the pips on the playing card with ample space between cubes.<br/><br/>Grab an extra cube, toss it into the air, flip over your hand and quickly pick up all the cubes representing your card, and then catch the tossed cube in the same hand.<br/><br/>Complete a card and move on to the next one on your turn. Miss and play passes to your opponent. First player to complete all 9 cards is the winner.<br/><br/>HERE ARE THE COMPLETE RULES:<br/><br/>PIP UP CUBES - A dexterity game for 2 players, ages 9+<br/>Designed by Bonnie Neubauer <br/>Winner of the Boardroomers February 2013 Design Contest <br/>(c) 2013 Bonnie Neubauer<br/><br/>Goal: Be the first player to work your way through all 9 of your cards, picking up cubes from the table (or floor) that are placed in the same pattern as the pips/symbols on the cards. You do this by tossing 1 cube in the air and, with the same hand, scoop up cubes from the table, then catch the tossed cube in that same hand... without dropping any cubes.<br/><br/>Components: 10 cubes &amp; 18 poker cards: A-9 of hearts or diamonds and A-9 of spades or clubs.<br/><br/>Set-up: Place the 10 cubes between both players. <br/>The 9 red cards go to one player, the 9 black to the other. <br/>Each divides her pack into 3 parts: Ace, 2-5, 6-9. <br/>Each places their Ace face-down on the table/floor. Then they shuffle their 2,3,4,5 cards and place them, face down on top of the Ace, each forming her own unique stack. Players both shuffle the 6,7,8,9 cards and each place them face-down on their stacks. <br/>Both players flip over their stacks so the Aces are face-up. Neither looks at the cards below. <br/>Player who is closest to 9 years of age goes first.<br/><br/>Play: First player places 1 cube on the table/floor. She tosses another cube in the air and, with that same hand, scoops up the table cube, and then catches the tossed cube in the same hand with the cube she picked up... without dropping any cubes. Do this and you accomplish the card!<br/><br/>If the first player fails to accomplish this (she dropped a cube or didn't catch the tossed cube), her turn is over and play moves to her opponent who attempts her own Ace card (picking up 1 cube).  <br/>Once a player successfully completes the Ace card, she places it on the bottom of her stack. This reveals her next card. It will be a 2,3,4, or 5. Her turn continues.<br/><br/>For cards 2-9, players place that number of cubes on the table, following the pattern of the pips/symbols on the card. All cubes should have at least a 1/8 inch space between them if you are playing with 1/2 inch cubes. Handicap players to even out skill, by adding more space or using less space between cubes. Here's what cubes will look like on the table for cards 3, 5, 6, 8:<br/><br/>A player's turn lasts until she fails to accomplish a card (drops cubes or fails to catch the tossed cube). This card stays face-up on top of her stack and she will re-start with this card on her next turn. Likewise, her opponent starts with the card that was left face-up on her own deck at the end of her last turn.  Once you are using cards greater than 4, you will have to re-arrange the cubes on the table each time your turn starts.<br/><br/>Turns continue back and forth. Players will be going for different cards most of the time. As each card is accomplished, it's placed on the bottom of the deck and the next card is immediately attempted on the same turn.<br/><br/>Winner: First player to successfully make it through all 9 of her cards wins. If she went first, the other player gets one last turn to catch her. If there is a tie, re-play the 9 card and first wins!<br/><br/>"}, "140923": {"rpgdesigner": ["Christian Fischer", "Daniel Florian", "Andreas Sebastian May", "Andreas Melhorn", "Frank Reiss", "\"stylo\"", "Zorro"], "statistics": [], "name": "Envoyer (Issue 49 - Nov 2000)", "rpgartist": ["Tobias Kuschill", "Kathy Schad", "J\u00f6rn Zimmermann"], "rpgproducer": ["Christian Fischer", "Daniel Florian", "Michael Junker", "Andreas Melhorn", "\"stylo\"", "Andr\u00e9 Wiesler", "Zorro"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1634153.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Envoyer"], "rpg": ["Das Schwarze Auge (DSA) (3rd Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["FZ Werbung Hannover"], "rpgissueversion": ["Softcover"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1634153_t.jpg", "description": "Issue 49, containing a DSA adventure, an interview with Thomas R\u00f6mer about the campaign setting Myranor, a bit of RPG theory (searching for the perfect rules), reviews and more.<br/><br/>"}, "140924": {"rpgdesigner": ["Niklas Forreiter", "Dominic Hladek", "Stefan Unteregger", "Niklas Vorreiter"], "rpgitemversion": ["hardcover version"], "poll": [], "name": "Im Lande des Thearchen", "rpgartist": ["Alan Lathwell"], "rpgproducer": ["Uli Lindner"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1629541.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": ["Myranor"], "average": "6", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Uhrwerk Verlag"], "rpg": ["Das Schwarze Auge (DSA) (4th Edition)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Abenteuer in Myranor"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1629541_t.jpg", "description": "(from the back of the book)<br/><br/>This anthology is designed as a companion volume to Unter dem Sternenpfeiler and includes three adventures, each in the Myranic Empire, the land of the divine Thearch.<br/><br/>After the heroes come in contact with a powerful Archon, they mus accompany the horses and riders of the shy people of Kentori on a hike across the vast steppe.

Players try to have the most points at the end of the game by creating beautiful garden paths for their visitors.<br/><br/>The deck has 80 cards in ten different colors, with each color featuring a different species of tree; each color has cards numbered 1 through 8, and the number of colors used depends on the number of players. Players start with a hand of seven cards. On each turn, a player draws two cards (from the deck or one or more of the discard piles), lays a card on the table as part of her arboretum, then discards a card to her personal discard pile.<br/><br/>When the deck is exhausted, players compare the cards that remain in their hands to determine who can score each color. For each color, the player with the highest value of cards in hand of that color scores for a path of trees in her arboretum that begins and ends with that color; a path is a orthogonally adjacent chain of cards with increasing values.

The game was only released in Japan on January 23, 1988 for the Nintendo Famicom.<br/><br/>HISTORY<br/><br/>Unlike other 1980s SunSoft games like Ikki or Atlantis no Nazo, Ripple Island is a peaceful command-based adventure game where the player chooses from 5 different actions (look, take, enter, hit, and push) in order to arrive at the game's ending. The game was re-released for the PlayStation in 2002 as part of the Memorial Series Sunsoft Vol.4 compilation, where it was coupled with Blaster Master. An i-appli mobile phone version which features improved graphics was also released in 2003. A manga version by one of the game's character designers, Moriken, was serialized in Wanpaku Comics (Tokuma Shoten). The character's appearances differ greatly in the manga version, and only lasted 4 chapters without reaching the conclusion of the game's story-line. 2 more chapters were added in the tank\u014dbon release, which do describe the game's true conclusion. Both the original Famicom cartridge and manga tank\u014dbon are rare, and can only be purchased for higher prices than their original value.<br/><br/>The game was originally planned for the Famicom Disk System with the title Koutei no Yami. The game enjoyed limited popularity as it was released only 18 days before the release of the highly anticipated Dragon Quest III. Though the game appears easy because of its childish graphics, very few hints are provided for solving certain mysteries, making the game's difficulty quite high. There are four different endings to the game, one of which can be seen even before the player defeats the final boss. The remaining three are decided depending on the player's actions and choices throughout the game. The staff roll is only displayed if the player reaches the game's &quot;true&quot; ending.<br/><br/>PLOT<br/><br/>The game takes place on a small island called Ripple Island, where humans and animals lived together in peace. However, one day, the evil emperor Gerog\u0113ru suddenly appears on the island and kidnaps the king's daughter. The king promises that he will allow whoever can rescue his daughter to marry her, and a young boy named Kyle sets off on a long journey to rescue the princess.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Ripple Island (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "140939": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Joseph Fatula"], "average": "7.11852", "poll": [], "name": "Actionworks", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "27", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1703294_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Joseph Fatula"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["The Lumenaris Group, Inc."], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1703294.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Industry / Manufacturing"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "A fast-paced Industrial-Revolution-themed card game.

Playing a card that matches your color is called &quot;Affinity&quot; and you get added benefits for doing this.  You can play Pillows, Weapons, Special Items, and Shields.  You do this by placing cards in your Action Row to be used on your next turn.  Your Action Row is a set of 3 cards that you play from on your turn.<br/><br/>Pillows are required to play Weapons and remain in play to help protect you until they are destroyed.  Weapons are used for attacking Players and Pillows and are always successful against Players with no Pillows.  Some Weapons, that are harder to use successfully, reward you with the Remote Card.  Thematically, this is something that is getting jostled about in the chaos and landing a really good hit buys you time to pick it up.  Special Items are used to destroy Pillows and Action cards, while Shields defend against certain Items.<br/><br/>Using Weapon and Item cards successfully rewards you with Movies!  The more challenging it is to use a Weapon card successfully, the more Movies you get.  Sometimes success will come down to the luck of the roll or draw, but most often you will rely on your foresight and timing to use cards successfully.  Pillow Fight is a game that rewards you for paying attention to what your  opponents do, giving you an edge if you notice patterns in play.  It is also dynamic enough that you can easily change your strategy each hand and change the tide of the game.

X-Plane contains subsonic and supersonic flight dynamics, allowing users to predict the flight characteristics of the slowest aircraft or the fastest. X-Plane also includes more than 30 aircraft in the default installation, spanning the aviation industry and its history. Aircraft included range from the Bell 206 JetRanger and Cessna 172 to the Space Shuttle and the B-2 Bomber. Additionally, more than 1,400 additional aircraft models can be downloaded from the Internet (X-Plane.org, the X-Plane.com Links page, and Google are good places to start looking), many of which are completely free. If those aren&rsquo;t enough, users can design their own airplanes and test-fly them!<br/><br/>Weather in X-Plane is variable from clear skies and high visibility to thunderstorms with controllable wind, wind shear, turbulence, and micro bursts. Rain, snow, and clouds are available for an instrument flying challenge, and thermals are available for the gliders. Actual weather conditions can be downloaded from the Internet, allowing users to fly in the weather that really exists at their current location!<br/><br/>X-Plane has detailed failure modeling, with multitudes of systems that can either be failed manually at an instructor&rsquo;s command, or randomly when users least expect it! Users can fail instruments, engines, flight controls, control cables, antennae, landing gear, or any of dozens of other systems at any moment. They can also have a friend or flight instructor (locally or via the Internet, working from an Instructor&rsquo;s Operating Station) fail components on the aircraft without the pilot&rsquo;s knowledge. The instructor can alter the time of day, weather conditions, and failure status of hundreds of aircraft systems and components. Additionally, the instructor can relocate the aircraft to a location of his or her choice at any time.<br/><br/>Aircraft models are also extremely flexible, allowing users to easily create paint jobs, sounds, and instrument panels to modify any airplane you choose. Custom airplane or helicopter designs can even be created and flown using X-Plane and the included Plane Maker software.<br/><br/>X-Plane&rsquo;s accuracy (in flight model), scope (in aircraft and terrain coverage), versatility (in aircraft type and weather conditions), add-on programs (in aircraft and scenery editors), customizability, downloadable aircraft, and downloadable scenery make it the ultimate flight simulation experience for Macintosh, Windows, and Linux platforms.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "140953": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1658650.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Bill Jaffe", "Robert A.
