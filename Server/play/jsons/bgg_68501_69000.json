Most games are playable in a hour. Even with six players, the rounds are quick. The movement mechanics are designed to feel more like driving and less like geometry.<br/><br/>Players select their vehicles from eight templates that represent a wide variety of vehicles from dune buggies and muscle cars all the way to heavy duty trucks and SUVs - each with its own unique characteristics. Players then use dice to further customize (and arm) the vehicles. The dice represent weapons, equipment and even the driver of the vehicle.<br/><br/>Play is centered around a maneuver deck that allows the players to 'program' their action for a turn. Programmable actions include both movement AND attacks. But players need to be careful, their drivers may not be able to handle EVERYTHING demanded of them resulting in a possible loss of control.<br/><br/>Games are scenario based with clear goals to keep the games shorter and focused. Scenarios include such situations as busting through a police roadblock, attacking a renegade compound, escort missions and more. Teams are used, allowing the players to be creative in their vehicle (and equipment) selections. Some vehicles may be better for certain tasks but it always handy to have someone riding backup.<br/><br/>Players can check here on BGG, as well as dicefestgames.com for info on development, new vehicles, new equipment and new scenarios<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["DiceFestGames edition"], "average": "7.13268", "name": "Outrider", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Action Point Allowance System", "Dice Rolling", "Press Your Luck", "Simulation"], "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": ["Outrider: (Not So) Passive Agression", "Outrider: Dealin' Damage", "Outrider: Tuner Cards"], "usersrated": "41", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Outrider"]}, "68505": {"poll": [], "name": "Imperishable Night", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese DOS CD-ROM edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic688091.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Project Shrine Maiden"], "videogametheme": ["Folklore", "Occult"], "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "videogamecharacter": ["Alice Margatroid", "Marisa Kirisame", "Reimu Hakurei"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Shanghai Alice"], "videogamefranchise": ["Project Shrine Maiden"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS"], "usersrated": "11", "average": "8.36364", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Shanghai Alice"], "vgcharacterversion": ["Alice Margatroid (Imperishable Night)", "Marisa Kirisame (Imperishable Night)", "Reimu Hakurei (Imperishable Night)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic688091_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/>The 8th installment in the project Shrine Maiden series.<br/><br/>Imperishable Night is a straightforward shoot'em-up, except that the player controls a flying girl instead of the typical spacecraft.

The object is to destroy alien invaders, while protecting astronauts on the landscape from abduction. Humans that are successfully abducted return as mutants that attack the ship. Defeating the aliens allows the player to progress to the next level. Failing to protect the astronauts, however, causes the planet to explode and the level to become populated with mutants. Surviving the waves of mutants results in the restoration of the planet. Players are allotted three chances (lives) to progress through the game and are able to earn more by reaching certain scoring benchmarks.

Each set of adjacent 4 squares is grouped into a quadrant, and labeled from A to Y, starting from the top, left hand side quadrant. Each square in a quadrant is numbered from 1 to 4, starting from the top, left hand side square.<br/><br/>One player is allocated the 6 quadrant in the top-left hand side of the board as his home sector, and the other takes the 6 quadrant in the bottom-right hand side of the board as his.

As in many wars, you have some idea of an opponent's strength and general location, but very little about the exact composition and location of his forces. Hence, the value of intelligence gathering should not be underrated.<br/><br/>Strategy will vary from game to game, but a major focus should be on the capture of stars: without them your forces will not grow, and , in the long run their lack will certainly cause you to lose. Think carefully about the initial layout of stars, and place your ships to capture the maximum number of points as soon as possible. Try and maintain a balanced force of ship sizes. Movement is hidden, and fairly rapid shifts of forces from one quadrant to another are possible. Remember that in combat the aim is to have the largest combined force - not necessarily a single, high value ship. A single, large strike ship may penetrate enemy lines and take out the opponent's home base... but if he sees it coming he may have time to regroup and knock it out.

Categorized by Sony as a miniature personal digital assistant, the device features a monochrome liquid crystal display (LCD), infrared  communication capability, a real-time clock, built-in flash memory, and a sound capability. Connecting to a PlayStation through a memory card slot, the PocketStation also functions as a PlayStation memory card. It was released exclusively in Japan on January 23, 1999.<br/><br/>Software for the PocketStation was typically distributed as extras for PlayStation games, included in the CD-ROM, enhancing the games with added features. Stand-alone software could also be downloaded through the PlayStation console. The software is then transferred to the PocketStation for use. A built-in infrared data interface allows direct transfer of data such as game saves between PocketStation units, as well as multiplayer gaming.<br/><br/>The original Japanese ship date for the PocketStation was set for December 23, 1998, but it was delayed a full month. Sony only shipped an initial 60,000 units of the peripheral when it was released on January 23, 1999. It was initially available in two case colors: white and clear. It proved extremely popular, selling out all over the region. Sony planned to release the PocketStation in the United States, but cancelled the localization due to manufacturing and supply-and-demand problems. A few games, such as Final Fantasy VIII and SaGa Frontier 2, retained PocketStation functionality in their localized versions.<br/><br/>The PocketStation's most popular game was Dokodemo Issho, which sold over 1.5 million copies in Japan and is the first game to star Sony's mascot Toro.

Instead, it bounces around with a downward gravity, and the player controls a small shrine maiden on the floor, who can move sideways and shoot talismans upwards, hitting the ball and giving it momentum. If the ball hits the player, he loses a life.<br/><br/>The ball's upwards (bouncing) momentum decreases a bit with each bounce, but the ball's sideways momentum doesn't decrease naturally. So if the player fails to hit the ball and it stops bouncing, it will soon simply roll sideways, killing the player.<br/><br/>The game consists of 20 screens to clear, with a boss on stage 10 and 20.<br/><br/>"}, "68665": {"poll": [], "name": "The Story of Eastern Wonderland", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese DOS CD-ROM edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2467413.png", "videogameseries": ["Project Shrine Maiden"], "videogametheme": ["Folklore", "Occult"], "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "videogamecharacter": ["Marisa Kirisame", "Mima", "Reimu Hakurei"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Shanghai Alice"], "videogamefranchise": ["Project Shrine Maiden"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS", "PC-9801"], "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Shanghai Alice"], "vgcharacterversion": ["Marisa Kirisame (Wonderland)", "Mima (Wonderland)", "Reimu Hakurei (Eastern Wonderland)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2467413_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/>The 2nd installment in the project Shrine Maiden series.<br/><br/>The Story of Eastern Wonderland is a straightforward shoot'em-up, except that the player controls a flying girl instead of the typical spacecraft.

Critters series of Open Gaming Content Sourcebooks: Along the Banks of the River Vaal. The E.N. Critters series as a whole is a set of theme-based creature books with the theme/setting information secondary to the creatures and used mainly as a focus to design them around as well as to provide GMs with additional background, species interaction and general environmental descriptions. The creatures are fairly well detailed, while the environmentally based themes have been left intentionally vague in many places to allow the GM more leeway to modify and drop them into their own campaign if so desired. It is our hope that these creatures and themes will spark creative and enjoyable game sessions.<br/><br/>This volume's theme is of creatures dwelling along a wide river known as the River Vaal although the water&rsquo;s edge in any body of fresh water, be it lake, pond, marsh, etc. will work just as well. The primary range is from temperate to warm, although some allowances have been made for creatures that could be found in colder climes.<br/><br/>     More than two dozen all new creatures<br/>     Full colour illustrations throughout<br/>     Detailed ecologies and background<br/>     A &quot;Suggested Knowledge&quot; table for each creature<br/>     A &quot;Rules &amp; Game Balance&quot;section for each entry<br/>     Counters for all creatures<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The River Vaal flows through the heart of the land, starting at the Firewind Mountain range and the Feygarden Hills, flowing through the edge of the Dunshadow Moors, and then winding its way lazily through the Forest of Broken Limbs. Once it emerges from the forest, it then passes over the Knife Edge, plummeting far and fast in a grand waterfall known as Dowdin&rsquo;s Falls. The area before the Knife Edge and Dowdin&rsquo;s Falls is known as the Upper Vaal, and after it, appropriately, is the Lower Vaal. After the falls, it forms a vast body of water known as Dowdin&rsquo;s Lake, feeding the nearby Grey Marshes and eventually becoming a river again and passing the Alabaster Hills and Growling Woods. It then meanders for a time and enters the Andelenian Forest where a large portion of it passes underground and feeds the massive roots of EarthTree. Rising to the surface again in the southern part of the forest, it continues flowing past the Swamp of the Sun and through the Feathered Sea Plains. It again picks up speed through the Azurothian Peaks and yet again slows down after it enters the Pale Jungle, eventually emptying out into the Helvenin Sea at the Aris Delta. The river is shown on the map as a single strip of blue for the sake of simplicity. Innumerable other rivers and streams feed into it, and there are plenty of backwater areas along its length.<br/><br/>"}, "68682": {"videogame": ["Heavy Rain: Move Edition"], "poll": [], "name": "Heavy Rain", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese PlayStation 3 edition", "North American PlayStation 3 (Greatest Hits) edition", "North American PlayStation 3 edition", "PSN PlayStation 4 Downloadable edition", "UK PlayStation 3 edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic728480.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Crime", "Detective / Mystery", "Moral Choices"], "videogamefranchise": ["Greatest Hits (Best Selling PlayStation Games, US)"], "usersrated": "295", "videogameexpansion": ["Heavy Rain Chronicles: Episode One: The Taxidermist"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Quantic Dream"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure", "Interactive Movie"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 4"], "videogamehonor": ["2009 Game Critics Most Original Game of the Year Nominee", "2009 Gamescom Best Playstation Game of the Year Winner", "2010 Game Critics Game of the Year Nominee", "2010 Japan Game Awards Most Innovative Game Winner", "2010 Spike Best Graphics of the Year Nominee", "2010 Spike Best PlayStation Game of the Year Nominee", "2011 British Academy Game Awards Best Art Direction of the Year Nominee", "2011 British Academy Game Awards Best Gameplay of the Year Nominee", "2011 British Academy Game Awards Best Soundtrack of the Year Winner", "2011 British Academy Game Awards Best Story/Narrative of the Year Winner", "2011 British Academy Game Awards Best Technical Direction of the Year Winner", "2011 British Academy Game Awards Game of the Year Nominee", "2011 D.I.C.E.

Tiles are drawn and discarded (openly, so other players can grab the discarded ones).

The first player to achieve a legal crossword scores points.<br/><br/>Achter-Spiel: Same as the F&uuml;nfer-Spiel, but two or more crosses have to be formed, three tiles can be kept.<br/><br/>Kaufspiel (for two players): Each player draws ten tiles and looks at them without sorting them. The active player can then announce &quot;buying&quot; or &quot;playing&quot;. When buying, he/she also announces a number of tiles. Both players now have to discard this number of tiles and redraw them. When playing, both try to form a legal cross with their tiles. The winning player gets 10-15 points, the other one a penalty depending on the number of unused tiles.<br/><br/>Leiter: Two columns of ten letters each are places on the table. The task of the players is to extend each pair of letters in one row into words. Thus they can get rid of their tiles. A player who cannot play has to draw a new tile. The first player to get rid of his/her tiles is the winner.<br/><br/>Gruppenspiel: Similar to Leiter, but with an open cross instead of fixed columns. So the players can add tiles in any direction, as long as the letter combination occurs in a German word.<br/><br/>Wettrennen: Each player gets 19 tiles and secretly forms a cross using at least 11 tiles. The score of the first player to achieve this is 10 plus the last digit squared (11 to 91 points). The other players lose one point for each unused tile.<br/><br/>W&ouml;rter anbinden: A letter is placed on the table. Each player takes turns to add a letter, but the letters still have to form the beginning of a word. When that is not possible, all but the last (at least) two tiles are discarded and the last letters start the new word. The first player who can use up his/her tiles is the winner.<br/><br/>Ausf&uuml;llspiel: Three letters are flipped open on the plate in the middle of the table.

The game stars a heroine named Rubi Malone voiced by actress Eliza Dushku.<br/><br/>WET is an action game that combines shooting and swordplay with stylish acrobatics and a mass of gore. The main character, Rubi, carries twin pistols (which appear to be revolvers, but hold a surprising amount of ammunition) and a sword (she can also carry dual shotguns, sub-machine guns, or crossbows), and can fire while jumping, sliding on her knees, seducing goons and running on walls. During these acrobatic actions, the game enters slow motion, and she will automatically aim at a second enemy, allowing the player to shoot at two enemies at once. She can also combine her attacks, such as wall running off a person or performing a sword uppercut while sliding. Racking up kills and collecting multiplier icons gains multipliers, which increase score and the rate at which Rubi regenerates health. Rubi can also regain health by finding bottles of whiskey. When activated, she takes a swig from the bottle, then throws the bottle into the air and shoots it. In some sections of the game, Rubi's face will get covered in blood and she will go into a murderous, berzerker-like rage. These sections are presented in noir style, with bold red, black and white visuals. Rubi's attacks become faster and stronger to fight against large numbers of enemies during these sections, and killing chains of enemies extends her psychotic fury. There are also motorway sections that feature shooting integrated with quick time events.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;WET_(video_game),&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "68756": {"rpgartist": ["Gary Chalk"], "statistics": [], "name": "Lone Wolf Club Newsletter (Special Issue - New Year 1986)", "rpgdesigner": ["Joe Dever"], "rpgproducer": ["Simon Osborne"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic690293.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Lone Wolf Club Newsletter"], "rpgissuearticle": ["1986 New Year's Special", "Magnamund", "Monastery Mailbag", "New Year's Special Treasure Hunt Competition", "News from the Monastery", "Order Form", "The Kai Konnection", "The Summer Special Crossword Competition", "Warlock Quest"], "rpg": ["Lone Wolf Club Newsletter", "Lone Wolf Gamebooks"], "rpgpublisher": ["Beaver Books", "Project Aon"], "rpgissueversion": ["Internet Edition"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic690293_t.jpg", "description": "User summary of articles in this newsletter:<br/><br/>     Monastery Mailbag: a selection of letters from Lone Wolf fans.<br/>     The Kai Konnection: a pen-friend listing feature.<br/>     The Summer Special Crossword Competition: solution to and winners of the previous special newsletter's competition.<br/>     News from the Monastery: previewing The Magnamund Companion.<br/>     Warlock Quest: an advertisement for Warlock.<br/>     Magnamund: a condensed history of the last free planet of Aon, covering the major events that have shaped this world in the 18,000 years from its creation to the defeat of Darklord Zagarna.<br/>     Order Form: for purchasing Lone Wolf Gamebooks.<br/>     New Year's Special Treasure Hunt Competition: requiring entrants to use their copies of the gamebooks to solve a riddle.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "68757": {"rpgartist": ["Gary Chalk"], "statistics": [], "name": "Lone Wolf Club Newsletter (Issue 5 - 1986)", "rpgdesigner": ["Joe Dever"], "rpgproducer": ["Simon Osborne"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic690316.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Lone Wolf Club Newsletter"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Beyond the Nightmare Gate & Castle Death", "Caption Competition", "Lone Wolf Club Painting & Drawing Competition", "Lone Wolf Crossword", "Monastery Mailbag", "News from the Monastery", "Newsletter No. 5", "Order Form", "The Kai Konnection"], "rpg": ["Lone Wolf Club Newsletter", "Lone Wolf Gamebooks"], "rpgpublisher": ["Beaver Books", "Project Aon"], "rpgissueversion": ["Internet Edition"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic690316_t.jpg", "description": "User summary of articles in this newsletter:<br/><br/>     Monastery Mailbag: a selection of letters from Lone Wolf fans.<br/>     Order Form: for purchasing Lone Wolf Gamebooks.<br/>     The Kai Konnection: a pen-friend listing feature.<br/>     News from the Monastery: previewing Grey Star Book 3: Beyond the Nightmare Gate and the cover of Book 07: Castle Death.<br/>     Lone Wolf Crossword<br/>     Caption Competition: winners of the previous newsletter's competition.<br/>     Grey Star Book 3: Beyond the Nightmare Gate &amp; Book 07: Castle Death: an offer to purchase the new books signed by the author.<br/>     Lone Wolf Club Painting &amp; Drawing Competition: in which entrants were to illustrate a scene from the Lone Wolf or Grey Star books.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "68758": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Luke Venechuk"], "poll": [], "name": "The Grass of Parnassus", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic694863_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic694863.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Fantasy", "Medieval", "Print & Play"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "A strategy/fantasy game played on two decks of standard poker-style playing cards, the basic idea behind The Grass of Parnassus was to create a fun strategy game which could be played on standard cards.<br/><br/>Each player has a city.

Actions include strenghtening your city, hiring a champion to defend your city, deploying spies and thieves, and attacking the enemy city or champion.<br/><br/>Though intended for two players, up to four may play at one time by adding one deck for each additional player; this may add more dimensions to the game as alliances and cooperatives may be formed and broken.<br/><br/>The play is not too intense, though planning a few turns ahead is essential to success.<br/><br/>"}, "68759": {"poll": [], "name": "WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["EU Xbox 360 edition", "NA PlayStation 2 edition", "US PlayStation 3 edition", "US Xbox 360 edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic958705.jpg", "videogameseries": ["WWE SmackDown vs. Raw"], "usersrated": "11", "videogamefranchise": ["Greatest Hits (Best Selling PlayStation Games, US)", "Platinum Range (Best Selling PlayStation Games, PAL)", "WWE Wrestling", "Xbox Classics (Best Selling Xbox 360 Games, PAL)"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Yuke's"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360"], "videogamehonor": ["2006 Game Critics Best Fighting Game of the Year Nominee"], "average": "6.36364", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["THQ"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic958705_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007 (often shortened to WWE SvR 2007 and known as Exciting Pro Wrestling 8: SmackDown! vs. Raw 2007 in Japan), is a professional wrestling video game released by THQ and developed by YUKE's Future Media Creators.

Colour is a key element in the gameplay, and players will experience an \u014ckami-esque style when entering certain parts of the city. In order to make that district coloured (&quot;inspired&quot;) again, players must weaken the German forces occupying the area. In doing so, that district's citizens regain their hope, characterized by the &quot;Will to Fight&quot; (WtF) factor, a measure of public morale.<br/><br/>In areas with low WtF, the area is dark, with colour being various shades of grey (with the exception of several German flags, bright red and complete with swastikas), whereas in areas with high WtF, the area is vibrant and with full colour. WtF also affects gameplay, as in areas with low WtF, the area is filled with German soldiers who patrol in most places of the map in large numbers.<br/>It is up to the player to return colour to areas of darkness.<br/><br/>In areas with high WtF, the Germans will not be completely evicted, but they will no longer be everywhere at once, and will primarily be centered around military bases, barracks, police stations, HQs, and other strategically important areas. In addition, the French people will play an active role in the struggle for areas with high WtF. For example, if Sean, the main character, gets in a fight with German patrols, allies like the French Resistance, Maquis, and even French passersby will intervene against the occupiers.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players will upgrade their character in the form of &quot;Perks&quot;. These will improve accuracy, ammo counts, damage and more. Perks are gained through actions, such as evading high alarm levels, sniping targets or demolishing a set number of German installations.<br/><br/>After you are introduced to the black marketeer Santos, you unlock weapons smugglers to buy weapons, ammunition, explosives, maps and other items.

It is a game of brutal attrition and slashing advances. Opening on the evening of D-Day, with the Allies on the beaches and the Germans reacting (albeit belatedly) to the landings, the game covers the full campaign through to the battle of the Ruhr Pocket in April of 1945.<br/><br/>With plenty of armor, paratroop divisions, naval gunfire, air superiority and even the 79th Funnies, the Allies will break out from the beaches and race across France toward the Seine River. To keep pace with operations they will face difficult logistical decisions including the grounding of units and Red Ball Express in favor of other operations, a surprisingly thin infantry leash, and whether to give Monty the lead in offensive operations over Patton (or vice-versa)&hellip; For the Allies there&rsquo;s a chance at an early auto-victory for breaking out of the landing areas ahead of schedule, but they can quickly lose the game if they don&rsquo;t cross the Seine on schedule.<br/><br/>The German player will need to counter the Allied push with a healthy dose of reinforcements (admittedly of low quality), but with very limited replacements. They will need to take advantage of opportunities to thwart the Allies such as when Monty looks the other way at Antwerp, and they can even win the game, although not the war, by launching a successful Counteroffensive (aka. The Bulge). Careful use of Panzer Brigades and Tiger Battalions in offense and defense will play a key role in stopping the Allies.<br/><br/>Storming the Reich is a two-map game with units portrayed mostly at division level (with some armored brigades and battalions). Each hex is about 8 miles across (or about 13km). Each turn represents a month of operations accept during summer where each turn is 2 weeks. For players of Red Storm over the Reich, there are many similarities such as the variable movement allowances for both sides (a key feature for fog of war, variability, replay value, and solitaire play) and the same basic combat engine. A key difference is the elimination of the Redeployment Phase.<br/><br/>There are 3 scenarios included. Scenario one is the full 15-turn campaign using both maps, beginning on D-Day and ending in April of 1945. The second is a one-map &ldquo;Normandy Breakout&rdquo; scenario &ndash; at only 4 turns it is a perfect learning scenario covering the initial desperate fighting following the landings. Lastly is a one-map &ldquo;Bulge to Victory&rdquo; scenario where both players really get to flex their gaming muscles.<br/><br/><br/>Ted Raicer's game on the campaign for Northwest Europe, using a variation of his Red Storm Over the Reich system. <br/>It does not link up with Red Storm Over the Reich.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "name": "Storming the Reich", "playingtime": "400", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "7.29795", "usersrated": "55", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "age": "0"}, "68817": {"rpgdesigner": ["Bethany Culp", "Stephen Michael DiPesa", "Jess Hartley", "Howard David 'Wood' Ingham", "James Kiley", "Ellen Kiley", "John Newman", "Mark Simmons", "Chuck Wendig", "Filamena Young", "Eric Zawadzki"], "rpgitemversion": ["Hardcover Version", "PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Unbidden", "rpgartist": ["Avery Butterworth", "Jeff Holt", "Michel Koch", "Brian LeBlanc", "Aileen E.

It is the magical that makes a normal story into a fantasy that delights listeners, readers, and gamers by making all the impossibilities we can imagine become real. Dreams of magic can make even the most mundane day something to cherish, like a poem evoking the charm of the everyday world.<br/><br/>But sometimes, just like poems, magic can become stale and clich&eacute;d. Through repeated exposure, its novelty can wear off, and certainly, thirty years of magic missiles and fingers of death have been enough to render many fantasy gamers jaded. At its core, saying, &ldquo;My love is a dove,&rdquo; in a poem is as trite as, &ldquo;I cast detect magic.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Elements of Magic opens the world of magic to you, letting you create almost any type of magic-user you&rsquo;d like. Magic is an artform, like poetry, and any good poet is never content to merely recite the works of others.<br/><br/>Elements of Magic is modular, able to fit whatever role you want it to play. It can be added to an existing campaign that already has wizards, sorcerers, clerics, and druids, perhaps representing another, higher sort of magic, or it can wholly replace the existing magic system, providing a whole new feel to your fantasy gaming. You will need a d20 core rulebook to use these rules, but this book will let you ignore the old, clich&eacute;d spells presented in those books, and create your own works of magical art.<br/><br/>Elements of Magic eliminates the spell memorization and preparation system entirely, replacing it with something bold, new and flexible. This book uses a spell list and magic point system, allowing you to build spells modularly, and letting you decide what the mechanics actually mean.<br/><br/>Elements of Magic is a rules module designed to replace the &quot;fire and forget&quot; spell system of the d20 Core Rules. The d20 spell system, while balanced and usable, is not flexible enough to model the magic users from most fantasy books and movies. Few wizards have ever memorized or prepared a spell, and even fewer forget them immediately afterwards. In Elements of Magic, each character has only a single spellcasting level, no matter how many types of magic she learns in her career. The Elements of Magic gives characters many times the options of the standard d20 rules. Individual spells are replaced by spell lists. Instead of learning a fireball spell, for example, a mage could learn the Evoke Fire spell list, which is very flexible as to its usage and appearance. Nor is the mage limited to fire evocations &ndash; with 20 elements to choose from, she could learn Evoke Lightning to stun and damage your foes, Transform Light to make them evaporate into a dim glow, or even exotic combinations of spell lists, such as Create Force/Drain Time, to lock them in a bubble of stasis. It would take thousands of standard spells to duplicate the effects of the spell lists in this 94-page book.<br/><br/>"}, "68839": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1002393.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1924", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgameartist": ["Margaret Mary Tempest"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Chad Valley Co Ltd."], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1002393_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational"], "description": "This game has 100 playing spaces.

Mirror's Edge is powered by the Unreal Engine 3 with the addition of a new lighting solution, developed by Illuminate Labs in association with DICE.<br/><br/>The game has a realistic, brightly coloured style and differs from most other first-person perspective video games in allowing for a wider range of actions such as sliding under barriers, tumbling, wall-running, and shimmying across ledges and greater freedom of movement, in having no heads-up display, and in allowing the legs, arms, and torso of the character to be visible on-screen. Mirror's Edge is set in a society where communication is heavily monitored by a totalitarian regime, and so a network of runners, including the main character, Faith, are used to transmit messages while evading government surveillance. In the style of a three-dimensional platform game, the player guides Faith over rooftops, across walls, and through ventilation shafts, negotiating obstacles in parkour fashion.<br/>&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Mirror's_Edge,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "68880": {"rpgdesigner": ["David Berent", "Jolly R.

Recently, however, extremists disrupted the peace with mortal conflict in the streets. Worse, mysterious thieves stole the Orb of Midnight &ndash; an evil artifact &ndash; from its guardians. Concurrently, rumors that a second source of Thygasha&rsquo;s renowned &ldquo;silver sand&rdquo; had been discovered caused would-be treasure seekers to foray into the exceedingly dangerous Khydoban Desert. Only a few lucky souls returned, whispering tales of vast caverns filled with the valuable drug. With handfuls of the precious material, several of these survivors financed return expeditions into the harsh wasteland, but none have returned. In addition, Prince Shyja&rsquo;s scouts have disappeared and an ancient burial crypt is now seen above the sands.<br/><br/>This world supplement and free-flowing adventure provides hooks for characters of any motivation, and enables their personalities to come alive as they solve mysteries, battle dangerous new foes, and much more. Explore the famous City of Dreams on the eastern side of Reanaaria Bay, around the Arajyd Hills, into the foreboding Khydoban Desert, through two dangerous dungeons, and (if you&rsquo;re lucky) back again.<br/><br/>Like all Kenzer and Company products, this adventure was designed with the Dungeon Master in mind. We prepare all the details so you can spend less time flipping pages and more time gaming. Being a DM has never been so easy, or so much fun!

Now DMs can not only read the boxed text, they can actually show it to the players.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Although easily converted for use in any campaign setting, this book is designed for the the official Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign setting, the Kingdoms of Kalamar - a realistic, dynamic world where complex political alliances mix with marauding bands of humanoids, and medieval technology and culture come faces to face with magic and the fantastic.

On his turn, a player chooses a question from one of the question categories. After the question has been read out loud, all players choose their answer by playing cards face down on the table. All answers are revealed simultaneously. Each question has an answer between 1-100 and player's answer is the sum of the numbers he played. The player whose answer is closest to the correct answer, wins the question card for himself/herself but loses the number cards he/she played. Players may also play 'pass'-card and skip the question, but get to draw new number cards instead.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players calculate their scores: players get points from won question cards and from hidden score cards that are dealt in the beginning of the game. During the game, players may influence what is the value of each question category at the end of the game - category's value depends on how many questions has been asked from that category. The game comes with eight question categories, from which five are chosen for each game.

Star Fox was the first game to be equipped with the Super FX chip, which is used to create the 3D graphical style with use of polygons, which couldn't be done with the basic SNES Hardware.<br/><br/>In the game the player is Fox McCloud, captain of the four-headed Star Fox team. The team has to defeat the evil Andross, by fighting their way through the Lylat system to Andross' home planet Venom. While the player only controls Fox McCloud and his Arwing, the other team members take part in the battle as well, and request for help from the player sometimes.<br/><br/>The player can choose between three different routes from the home planet Corneria to the enemy planet Venom. These routes differ in difficulty. Some levels take place over a planet, others take place in space. All the members of the Star Fox team fly in an Arwing. An Arwing's main weapon is a laser beam-like weapon. This weapon can be improved by finding upgrades hidden in the levels. A secondary weapon are nova bombs. They are limited in supply, but can be found throughout the levels as well.<br/><br/>While the game is in many ways a Rail Shooter, the player has some freedom of movement. The main progress of the Arwing through the level is automatic, but the Arwing can be moved vertically and horizontally, which is needed to aim. Apart from that the player has the possibility to brake or accelerate. This can be used to dodge enemy attacks and flying objects, or to get certain upgrades.
