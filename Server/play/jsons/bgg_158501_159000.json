It can be played with 2 to 6 players. It is played with American Standard Playing Cards, which is a deck of cards inspired by traditional playing cards.<br/><br/>THE DECK<br/><br/>The 58-card deck has 4 suits (Faith, Declaration, Revolution, and Unity) with 14 ranks: The 1st - 10th Amendment, A Gentleman, a Lady, a Patriot, and a Foundation.  There are also 2 Jokers, which are actually a king and queen. The suits are in 2 colors: Red and Blue.<br/><br/>Faith is represented by a Blue Triangle, (The &quot;All-seeing Eye of the Creator&quot; - like on the back of the $1 Bill)<br/>Declaration by a Red Pentagon<br/>Revolution by a Red Triquetra (Trinity Knot) with a coiled &quot;Don't tread on me!&quot; style snake in the center.)<br/>and Unity by a Blue Circle with 13 stars.<br/><br/>The deck was designed to have a theme of American history and patriotism.  Since America was founded by declaring independence of a royalty-based ruling system, the face cards and suits were changed.  The Amendment cards have portions of the actual text of the named Constitutional Amendment printed on the card, and that text is used in the playing of &quot;Liberty Match&quot;.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/><br/>The dealer deals between 5-7 cards to each player (depending on how many players there are). The remaining playing cards are placed face down to form a stock.  The player to dealer's left starts.<br/><br/>Once a pair is made (even if dealt a pair from the beginning) it is to be laid down, face up, on the table in front of the player.<br/><br/>In each turn, a player asks for a rank of card that they already have in their hand from a specific other player.  If the asked player has that card, they must give the asking player that card.  If the asked player does not have that card, they reply with &quot;Catch a Liberty&quot; - then the asking player takes the top card from the deck on the table.<br/><br/>Before play can continue, the asking player must read the text from one of the other cards in their hand - just the text, not the name of the card.  (Players cannot continue to read the same card repeatedly, unless it is their last card.)<br/><br/>If the asking player is given the card they asked for, or if they draw a card that matches one of the cards they are holding, they can continue to go.  If a player is told to &quot;Catch a Liberty&quot; and is unable to make a pair, the next player may go.<br/><br/>When a player has no playing cards left, they must then draw a playing card from the stock until all playing cards run out. The game continues until all the playing cards are played even the stock. The winner is the player who then has the most pairs in front of them.<br/><br/>Example of a turn:<br/><br/>Player 1 asks Player 3 if they have the 1st Amendment. Player 3 hands Player 1 a 1st Amendment. Player 1 lays down the two 1st Amendment cards, then reads &quot;A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.&quot; (the text from the 2nd Amendment.) And then asks Player 2 if they have any 4th Amendments.  Player 2 says &quot;Catch a Liberty&quot;.  Player 1 draws a card and then reads &quot;Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.&quot;  It is now Player 2's turn.<br/><br/>There are 2 Jokers the &quot;King of Tyranny&quot; and &quot;The King's Queen&quot; - these have the 4 suits from the standard - or French Deck.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Republic Deck edition"], "name": "Liberty Match", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Betting/Wagering", "Co-operative Play", "Hand Management", "Memory", "Partnerships", "Set Collection", "Trading", "Trick-taking"], "average": "4.5", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "158538": {"rpgartist": ["Dobroslav Baranek", "Dirk D\u00f6mges", "Tom Kidd", "Uwe K\u00f6rner"], "statistics": [], "name": "Fantasywelt (Issue 22 - 1989)", "rpgdesigner": ["Uwe Heilmann", "Uwe K\u00f6rner", "Dirk Lunken", "Hartwig Nieder-Gassel", "Joachim Sieberg", "Dirk Zeumer"], "rpgproducer": ["Uwe K\u00f6rner", "Volker Otzen", "Stefan H.

The game was released on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One in April 2014.<br/><br/>Like previous games in the series, Trials Fusion presents an arcade take on the real-life sport of observed trials. The player controls a rider on a physics-based motorcycle from the start of the level to the end while navigating a number of obstacles. The game uses 3D graphics, but is played on a 2D plane, so the rider can only move forwards and backwards. The player controls how the rider shifts their weight forward and backward in order to perform wheelies and stoppies and well as flips while in the air. Unlike in previous Trials games, players can also perform freestyle motorcross stunts while in the air by moving the right analog stick.<br/><br/>Trials Fusion will also feature a track editor, allowing players to create their own courses and games, though the ability to create supercross courses as in Trials Evolution is missing.<br/><br/>Deluxe Edition version of Trials includes season pass.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Trials Fusion&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>A continuation of the racing-platforming Trials series.

It can be simply competative, like most games.  It can be a sophisticated game that features competitive cooperation, or it can be a completely cooperative game.  You are invited to invent your own game using the board, but we would suggest that you start with the usual competitive game to learn how to balance cards most effectively and how to guess future peg locations with the greatest success. (Remember that the longest dimension of a card is from one corner to another.)&quot;<br/><br/>In Game I., 2 players (or 2 teams of 2 players) compete to be the first the cross the board from one site to the opposite side with a continuous bridge of cards balanced on pegs.<br/><br/>Play progresses by each player throwing 2,d6 dice then a player may place a peg in the area on the board that matches the number thrown.  After placing a peg, you may attempt to balance one or more cards on your peg(s).  You may not overlap or touch an opponent's card bridge or share pegs.  You must place a card within 20 seconds or lose your turn.  The game ends when one of the players spans the board from one side to the opposite side (side to side, up and down, or diagonally).  A completed bridge is worth 3 points.  The usual match is to 6, 9, or 12 points.<br/><br/>Game II variant:  This variant is a cooperative/competitive game for 3 players.   Three players attempt to cross the board, but at any time 2 players may voluntarily decide to merge and build a bridge together.  If they succeed in reaching the opposite site first, each player receives 1.5 points.  The usual match is to 4, 5, or 7 points.<br/><br/>Game III variant:  This version is fully cooperative and is for 2, 3, or, 4 players.  All players work together to build a successful bridge. Individual scoring is assessed by counting the same-colored number of cards belonging to an individual player.  You may also desire to set a time limit as the goal for building a bridge together.<br/><br/>"}, "158624": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2452671.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Masao Suganuma"], "statistics": [], "boardgamecompilation": ["Minivilles: 5-6 Extension", "Stadt Land Spielt Limitierte Sonderdrucke 2015"], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Noboru Hotta"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Foxgames (Poland)", "Grounding", "IDW Games", "KOSMOS", "Pandasaurus Games", "uplay.it edizioni", "White Goblin Games"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2452671_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "City Building", "Dice", "Expansion for Base-game"], "description": "Machi Koro: Gaming Mega Store is a one-card expansion for Machi Koro, with five copies of the card being included.<br/><br/>Die Roll: 10, Cost $7<br/>Effect: &quot;You may choose to activate another of your non (landmark, big establishment icon) establishments in place of this one, on your turn only.

The Adventure Creator guides you through the structure used by professionally written adventure supplements, and the Story Charts, found in the middle of this book, can provide you countless combinations of ideas to inspire you and beef up the ideas you already have. Once you've read through the chapter covering the Creator, you'll know all you need to know to go ahead and give adventure writing a try.<br/><br/>The chapter that comes after, Variations on the Act Structure will cover several different ways you can build your adventures beyond what you first learn with the Adventure Creator. One of the great things about every system presented in this book is that they are all modifiable and adaptable to whatever you want them to be. No one writes adventures the exact same way, or plays their games the exact same way, so you're always encouraged to make the book adapt to what you want it to be.<br/><br/>The Solo GM Guidebook<br/><br/>Using the Adventure Creator as its primary tool, the Solo GM Guidebook is a system that assists solo roleplayers in playing their games all by themselves. It will show you how to create your adventures as you play them, scene by scene, improvising everything as you go, playing both as the PCs and as the GM. Thanks to the framework provided by the Adventure Creator even improvised adventures can maintain a consistent and coherent narrative that, with a little practice, can be very much like playing with a prewritten supplement.<br/><br/>Besides the story of your roleplaying adventure, the Guidebook also has suggestions, tips, and charts to help you make PC personalities, NPCs, improvise conversations, create clues, devise mysteries, and more. Once you have read the chapter you can immediately begin adopting the tools you like to help facilitate your gameplay, and enjoy your favorite RPGs as a solo GM!<br/><br/>"}, "158668": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Wettrennen mit dem Verderb", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2007416_t.png", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Deutsche Landwerbung G.m.b.H.,"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2007416.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Dice", "Educational", "Racing"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Objective: be the first reaching space 80/learn more about the lifecycle of food<br/> - moving by turns - <br/>Move forward according die roll; ending on a marked space follow instructions printed on the back of the map<br/><br/>"}, "158670": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Duane Rajkumar"], "poll": [], "name": "Mecha Mettle", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Dice Rolling", "Player Elimination", "Take That", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2007683_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2007683.png", "boardgameversion": ["Print & Play edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Dice", "Print & Play", "Space Exploration"], "age": "14", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Theme<br/>In the distant future, the galaxy is at war.

The tomb was discovered on June 1952 and it represents one of the most important archaeological discoveries of history.<br/><br/>In this game the players collaborate with the pyramid construction and each player tries to accumulate the biggest treasure in order to win the game. The treasure is formed by the treasure tiles that are obtained during the construction stages, and the jewel cards that can be accumulated till the end of the game.<br/><br/>The rounds are composed by 3 phases.  Each phase concludes when all the players have performed their play for that phase.<br/><br/>PHASE 1: CARDS DRAW<br/>Each player draws 2 cards from the top of the pile.  If a player draws a card of a level that has been already constructed, this card is sent to the discard pile and the player can draw a new card.<br/><br/>PHASE 2: CARDS SWAP<br/>Each player can swap one of their cards with one card at the swap zone; players must leave the cards face up. Cards of already constructed levels cannot be used.<br/><br/>PHASE 3: CONSTRUCTION<br/>Each player decides if he summons to the construction of the pyramid's level, if he chooses not to, then the player must mention that he passes the opportunity to the next player.<br/>If no player summons to the construction, then is the end of the phase 3 and the round concludes.<br/>When a player summons to the construction he must pay 1 point (with his treasure tiles) and place the tile over the gameboard, this gives him the right to be the first to set cards for construction.<br/><br/>CONSTRUCTION RULES<br/>-Pyramid levels must be constructed in ascending order.<br/>-Each pyramid level is completed with 5 construction cards of the corresponding level.<br/>-Jewel cards can be used as wild cards.  Two jewel cards will be considered as one construction  card, so they must be used in pairs for this purpose.<br/>-A player can set a m&aacute;ximum of 3 construction cards.<br/><br/>If a player summons to the construction but the 5 necessary consturction cards (required for the corresponding level) are not completed, then players take back the set cards and the player that has summoned to the construction loses the point that he has paid.  In this case is also the end of phase 3 and the round concludes.<br/><br/>In case that the construction of the corresponding level is completed:<br/>-The corresponding pyramid tile is placed over the gameboard.<br/>-The players that have collaborated in the construction take the corresponding points from the treasure tiles at the gameboard (see the scoring rules).<br/>-Cards used for the construction are sent to the discard pile.<br/>-If any player has cards left of the consturcted level, then he must place them on the discard pile (players have no right to recover these cards).<br/>-If there are cards of the constructed level at the swap zone, they are placed on the discard pile as well and replaced with cards from the pile.<br/><br/>END OF GAME<br/>When the construction of level 9 of the pyramid (temple) is completed, the game ends.<br/>The jewel cards that players have accumulated have a value of 1 point each and are added to the value of thier treasure tiles.

During the game, players can shoot down UFOs to release DNA which, when collected, increases the effectiveness of their selected weapon. The DNA will scatter if the player loses a life.

Only a few indomitable clans still hold the line and struggle against their tyranny.<br/><br/>However, in recent times the rule of the Elves seems to have weakened, certainly as the result of many years of corruption and self-indulgence. With their guard lowered, now is the perfect time to try to regain control! Become the leader of a clan, train your troops, equip them, and move out to reclaim the land stolen by the Elves!<br/><br/>To reign supreme, you have to vanquish the Elves and defeat any other clan that gets in your way!<br/><br/>&bull;    Goal<br/><br/>You must conquer the cities of the Elves to strengthen your clan, and fight against the enemy clans. For each city under your control you earn a certain amount of Victory Points based on the level of the city. As soon as a player reaches or exceeds 30 VPs, the current game round is played to the end and the player with the most Victory Points wins. For a longer game, play up to 50 VPs.<br/><br/>&bull;    Description and setup<br/><br/>Victory is achieved through conquest. The players build a different &lsquo;world&rsquo; at the beginning of each game by arranging the modular map tiles. The tiles contain multiple different regions, sometimes separated by obstacles (mountains, lakes, etc.) Some regions host the cities of the Elves (an unplayable faction, and the villains of the story), others hold special locations (goldmine, witches&rsquo; den, inventor&rsquo;s workshop, etc.), and on each tile there is also a teleportation portal (all portals are interconnected, to avoid the map from being too broken up and compartmentalized).<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player chooses the clan they want to embody: The Steamfield Barony, the Bohorg tribe, clan Godleif, or the Army of the Tomb. Then each player chooses an empty region and places their clan&rsquo;s Stronghold there - this region cannot be attacked by other players, and is also where units are recruited and sent out to conquer the world!<br/><br/>Elves are placed in all areas where there are Elven cities, and then random equipment cards are drawn to make up the black market. The black market will change during the course of the game, as items sell out and new ones are added.<br/><br/>&bull;    Shopping phase<br/><br/>Each round is divided into two phases: Shopping and Action. During the Shopping phase, players will - in order that changes each turn &ndash; take turns either buying equipment from the black market, or passing.<br/><br/>By shopping at the black market players acquire new equipment which they then assign to their units (each clan has 3 different types of units, which complement each other). There are two kinds of equipment- hand gear (weapons, shields, tools, items, etc.) and body gear (armor, capes, etc.) Each unit can equip both.<br/><br/>If the player does not wish to continue shopping, they may &lsquo;pass&rsquo; instead, which allows them to pick their place in the order of play. Thus, the sooner a player finishes up with their purchases, the better their position in the ensuing Action phase will be. As soon as all players have wrapped up their shopping, they may recruit units in their Strongholds, and then the round continues with the Action phase.<br/><br/>&bull;    Action phase<br/><br/>During this phase, in order of play (which is determined during the Shopping phase, as described above), each player will be able to move their units and resolve the resulting battles. Each player gets a number of movement points, depending on their clan (some are slower than others) and the number of captured Elven cities.<br/><br/>Each movement point allows a group of units to move to an adjacent region (regardless of the number of units). So the players must manage these points in order to expand their kingdoms, but also to strengthen and protect their positions. Some clans are more offensive in nature, and others more defensive, but the risk of sudden invasion is always present due to the access to teleportation portals- the situation may change dramatically at any moment in the game!<br/><br/>When a player finishes their movements, they immediately resolve their battles in all areas where their units are facing enemy units or Elves. When engaging against the latter, they are controlled by one of the opposing players. Battles are resolved through a series of alternating battle actions made by the attacker and the defender, starting with the defender.<br/><br/>For their battle action, the player may either Retreat (returning their units safely to their Stronghold, but giving up the area to their opponent) or stay and Fight. Fighting is resolved by rolling a number of dice depending on the statistics of the units, with each roll resulting in a Hit or Miss. Hits are used to eliminate enemy units, and if one player&rsquo;s forces are unable to destroy any units, they receive a Rage token which improves their damage until the end of the battle. Rage allows even smaller and weaker forces to defend themselves in a pinch, and it may also be used in combination with certain abilities.<br/><br/>Some units also provide &lsquo;Shields&rsquo; which protect the entire force from incoming damage, and others allow friendly units to reroll their combat rolls or bring other unique abilities to the fray. All units can synergize and boost each-other&rsquo;s performance, which is why it is important to pick forces carefully, equip the right gear for the right unit, and to quickly eliminate certain enemy units in order to break the opposing force&rsquo;s dynamics.At the end of a battle, if the enemies have been eliminated or forced to retreat, the region is seized along with any bonuses it provides. Once a player has concluded their Action phase, they collect loot from the areas under their control, and calculate their Victory Points from the Elven cities they occupy (the bigger a city is, the more VPs it provides, but also the harder it is to conquer), then the next player&rsquo;s Action phase begins.<br/><br/>If a player reaches a certain amount of Victory Points (normally 30), every other player gets to finish their action phase and at the end of the round the player with the most VPs wins the game!<br/><br/>&bull;    Clan Specializations<br/><br/>During the course of a game, a clan&rsquo;s Specializations will become unlocked. Each player receives 4 unique Specializations at the beginning of the game, and will be able to activate two of them. Specializations provide bonuses to the player and change the way the game is played, making each game feel different, even when using a clan the player is very familiar with.<br/><br/>There are 2 tiers of Specializations: Normal, which provide a moderate bonus, and Binding which provide a stronger bonus but also impose a certain penalty on the player (for example, &lsquo;Plunder&rsquo; lowers normal income, but allows extra gold to be gained when playing aggressively, and &lsquo;War Fury&rsquo; cancels all of your forces&rsquo; Shields but grants them a large damage bonus).<br/><br/>Players have to plan their strategy by considering the regions' terrain, their force&rsquo;s composition and gear, and their clan&rsquo;s Specializations, and must carefully balance the risks of combat when deciding on their tactics.<br/><br/>"}, "158754": {"rpgartist": ["Aaron Acevedo", "Samuel Araya", "James Denton", "Mauro Mussi", "Borja Puig Linares", "Alida Saxon"], "rpg": ["Mummy: The Curse"], "statistics": [], "name": "Cursed Necropolis: D.C.", "rpgdesigner": ["Harry L.

Each module covers an important era of development, World War I, Inter War Years, World War II, Korea and the Modern era. Taken together, the full series will show how the aircraft has evolved as a weapons system.<br/><br/>Each module will use the same core movement and combat systems and share basic rules between the modules where appropriate. For example, the same rules are used to cover aircraft movement across all modules. Learn one set of rules and you will be able to play any module with the addition of era specific rules such as RADAR or turbine engines.<br/><br/>Each module uses the same basic rules, chart and table layout. The modules scale has been adjusted to fit aircraft performance of the era. For example, the World War I module has a scale of 100 feet per hex, 4.5 seconds per Tactical Game turn and each flight point is 15 mph. The Inter War Years module uses a scale of 200 feet per hex, 4.5 seconds per game turn and each flight point is 30 mph. The World War II module uses a scale of 300 feet per hex, 4.5 seconds per game turn and 50 mph per flight point. The Korean module uses a scale of 500 feet per hex, 4.5 seconds and 75 mph per flight point. The Modern rules use a scale of 800 feet per hex, 6 seconds per game turn and 100 mph per flight point.<br/><br/>The game may be played on two levels depending on the level of detail desired, Tactical Combat and Flight Operations. When using the Tactical Combat scale, a map board and counters that represent individual aircraft and ground units are used to play combat engagements. At the Flight Operations scale, the player is responsible for meeting mission requirements and leading his flight to and from the target area.<br/><br/>The WarBirds Game System shows the performance differences between aircraft and technological developments have in tactical combat. For example, the World War I rules show the difference between a Fokker DVII with a 160 hp Mercedes engine and one powered by a 185 hp BMW engine. Weapon synchronization systems have an impact on the rate of fire and number of hits on the target. All aircraft have a safe G-Load rating. Maneuver beyond this load and the aircraft may suffer structural damage or failure. Aircraft carry a limited amount of fuel and ammunition to complete the assigned mission. Aircrew are limited in the number of operations they may perform during the game turn by Task Points. How aircraft and aircrew limitations and technological advances influenced air combat engagements may be experienced while playing WarBirds.<br/><br/>Each aircraft data card reflects the performance analysis of an individual aircraft, each subtype or advanced model will have a dedicated data card.<br/><br/>Canvas Falcons is the first module to be released and covers the air war from 1914 to 1918. Fifty two aircraft data cards representing important types that saw service in the air forces of the nations involved.

Gamemasters in AD&amp;D and other game systems often had the problem, that they either played in an official campaign world or in one of their own making. But DMs also tried often to play according to the rules and to use only &ldquo;official&rdquo;-campaign sources (and their own self-created ones, of course). So the situation in AD&amp;D was, that there were dozens of different items out there in as many different rule books with the same amount of errata in complete and optional handbooks. Therefore you often had to go through all the different supplements to check them for errata and new updated informations &ndash; the reason for this compiled version, which lists ALL magical items of the core books of AD&amp;D without campaign related items but with errata and all available update informations at one glance...and what more important is: with reworked tables to determine the magic items themselves! Because, why was adventuring so exciting and popular? Because of the hunt for treasury and new experiences. But this meant, that you had to offer some new elements and items and not only those, known from the basic rule book, the Dungeon Masters Guide, 2nd edition.<br/><br/>&hellip;<br/><br/>In this work magical items from the following books are compiled<br/>- The Players Handbook 2nd Edition<br/>- The Tome of Magic<br/>- The DMs Guide, 2nd Edition<br/>- Monster Manual I<br/>- TcBarbH \u2013 The complete Barbarian Handbook<br/>- TcBaH - The complete Bard Handbook<br/>- TcDrH - The complete Druid Handbook<br/>- TcFiH \u2013 The complete Fighters Handbook<br/>- TcPaH \u2013 The complete Paladins Handbook<br/>- TcPsiH \u2013 The complete Psionics Handbook<br/>- TcPrH \u2013 The complete Priest Handbook<br/>- TcRaH \u2013 The complete Ranger Handbook<br/>- TcThiH \u2013 The complete Thieves Handbook<br/>- TcWizH \u2013 The complete Wizard Handbook<br/>- DwH \u2013 The complete Dwarves Handbook<br/>- EH \u2013 The complete Elves Handbook<br/>- Gn&HH \u2013 The complete Gnomes and Halflings Handbook<br/>- HH \u2013 The complete Humanoids Handbook<br/>- DMOHLC \u2013 DMs Option \u2013 High Level Campaign<br/>- DMO:C&T \u2013 DMs Option \u2013 Combat & Tactics<br/>- PlO:S&P \u2013 Players Option \u2013 Skills & Powers<br/>- PlO:S&M \u2013 Players Option \u2013 Spells & Magic<br/><br/>The items are listed with their original text and were expanded with all errata and comments.

The game is played with a deck of 54 cards, each with three topics or categories written on one side. One player draws a card and selects the first, second, or third category (by choice or convention, depending on which set of rules is used). The player then names something that belongs to the category, prompting the next player to do the same, and so on. Play continues in this fashion until a player cannot give an answer in a reasonable amount of time (typically about 2 seconds) or repeats an answer previously used during the round. Once a player loses the round, they place the card in front of them, and draw a new card to begin the next round. The player with the fewest cards in front of them after 54 rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>The rules included in Brangle offer suggestions for modifying gameplay. One example is to play an &quot;elimination game&quot; in which players are removed from the game after accumulating three cards. The last player remaining is the winner. It is also suggested that the game can end after a predetermined amount of time (30 minutes) instead of playing through the entire deck of cards. Another suggestion is to allow players to choose which of the three categories on each card they want to play, rather than always choosing the first, second or third.<br/><br/>Creative or unusual answers and responses are highly encouraged.

That fleet consisted of more than 5,300 ships carrying over 300,000 men and 50,000 vehicles. Opposing them was Germany&rsquo;s veteran Wehrmacht.<br/><br/>ATLANTIC WALL is a grand-tactical simulation of that campaign. The counters represent almost every formation that participated at the company and battalion level. Infantry, armor, anti-tank, reconnaissance, engineer, assault gun, howitzer, rocket, parachute, ranger, commando, glider and headquarter units are fully represented. Features include Widerstandnesten (resistance nests), Cherbourg&rsquo;s fortifications and the all-important Bocage. The map portrays all primary and secondary roads, trails and other types of terrain, along with the villages, towns and cities that formed the bastions of German defense. As always with this series, the orders of battle have been extensively researched to provide an accurate and functional depiction of the armies of both sides.<br/><br/>There are three introductory one-map scenarios depicting critical periods in the campaign that use an abbreviated set of rules while still maintaining the historical accuracy of the campaign game as a whole. In addition, there are three larger multi-map scenarios that allow players to either play a short period within the overall campaign or play the campaign from various starting points. The 6 June assault is covered in two modules, the Airborne Assault Module and the Amphibious Assault module, which allow players to recreate both the airborne and initial amphibious assault stage of the campaign. The Amphibious Assault Module is played on a special Beach Display that shows each sub-area of the invasion beaches with units depicted at the company level. It can be played as a solitaire scenario. The campaign game can be played from 6 June to 22 August, with a total of 234 game turns.<br/><br/>This is the third instalment of the Grand Operational Simulation Series (GOSS), the first two being: Wacht am Rhein and Hurtgen: Hells Forest. All three games share a common rules set that&rsquo;s been extensively updated and revised to simplify game functions while still maintaining the design of the earlier games. In addition to the basic rules, Atlantic Wall includes a set of exclusive rules to cover the special requirements of the amphibious and airborne landings and the logistical system required to support the armies coming ashore.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.94861", "name": "Atlantic Wall: D-Day to Falaise", "playingtime": "14400", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "16", "usersrated": "36", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Grand Operational Simulation Series"]}, "158794": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jeb Boyt", "Lee Hammock"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Out of Strife, Prosperity", "rpgartist": ["Drew Baker", "Kent Burles", "Caleb Cleveland", "Talon Dunning", "Tim Hibbetts", "Mike Vilardi"], "rpgproducer": ["Tom Cadorette", "Joseph Carriker", "Hal Mangold"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2008725.png", "usersrated": "2", "average": "7.5", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Chronicle System"], "rpgpublisher": ["Green Ronin Publishing"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2008725_t.png", "description": "From publisher web page:<br/><br/>Whether they are a peaceful agrarian House known for their vast fields of grain and fine warhorse bloodlines, or a sinister House notorious for their extravagant wealth and rumors of assassins in their employ, noble Houses are defined by the kinds of Wealth Holdings they invest in.

The game is designed to be a playable, two-player brigade-scale game that allows players to experience the unique tactical warfare matchups that characterized fighting during the Franco-Prussian War.<br/><br/>This era, though generally overlooked in the gaming industry, is a fascinating study in Napoleonic tactics (and uniforms) slamming head-on into modern killing technology. The Prussian military juggernaut is armed with the new steel Krupp breach-loading artillery pieces that far outclassed the French guns. Prussian doctrine, adapted to the lessons learned during the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, allowed junior officers to exercise initiative and aggressiveness. The French army, meanwhile, was armed with the modern and deadly Chassepot rifle, a firearm so advanced that many argue its deployment alone should have won the war for the French. In addition, the French army was now equipped with their ultimate secret weapon - the Mitrailleuse, which was the first machinegun used en masse. Moreover, the game system makes clear that the French soldier, despite misconceptions to the contrary, fought valiantly during these battles. By all rights, they could have &ndash; and should have &ndash; won many of these engagements. But leadership, morale and tenacity won the day for the Prussians.<br/><br/>All these factors are seamlessly embedded into the At Any Cost game system and players will be challenged to utilize their advantages and minimize their disadvantages throughout the game. Will YOU as the Prussian player be able to withstand an early severe numerical disadvantage and use the brave audacity of the Prussian soldier and artilleryman to win the day? Can YOU as the French player overcome the lethargic and uninspired command structure of the Army of the Rhine and allow your tough and well-equipped infantry to fight unhindered?<br/><br/>At Any Cost: Metz 1870 also features the Blind Swords chit-pull system which emphasizes the three &ldquo;FOW&rsquo;s&rdquo; of military conflict: fog-of-war, friction-of-war and fortunes-of-war. With each chit pull, players will be challenged to make tough decisions based on their assessment of the current situation. Unlike traditional chit-pull mechanisms, the Blind Swords system ensures that no combat units can be counted on, or conversely, counted out. This yields an environment of tense action and constant surprises &ndash; an environment that will challenge each player.<br/><br/>UNITS<br/><br/>All brigades and artillery groups of both the French Army of the Rhine and the Prussian First and Second Armies that took part in these actions are represented in the Order of Battle. Each Strength Point equals 600 infantrymen, 450 cavalry troopers, 3 heavy artillery pieces or 4 light artillery pieces. In addition, units have a Cohesion Rating, representing the unit&rsquo;s morale, training and experience plus a Movement Allowance.<br/><br/>SYSTEM HIGHLIGHTS<br/><br/>Combat and Cohesion System: The combat system is &ldquo;firepower&rdquo; based and utilizes the unit&rsquo;s size and Cohesion Rating to determine its effectiveness. The combat system is driven by a two-D10 dice mechanic. Two differently-colored dice are rolled simultaneously. The first (colored) die generates an initial result and the second (white) die simultaneously informs the players of any physical casualties suffered by the unit and any morale effect of the enemy&rsquo;s fire. The assault combat system uses a differential mechanism and results in a more dynamic combat outcome.<br/><br/>Orders System: A player must first choose one of four possible Orders that an activated Brigade will operate under &ndash; Attack, Defend, March or Regroup. Each Order has specific parameters that provide benefits and restrictions. This Order choice can be critical to a unit&rsquo;s performance during its activation.<br/><br/>Chit-Pull System: The Blind Swords chit-pull system generates challenging actions and difficult decisions for both players. It features three different types of chits, all of which reside in the same cup, each with special effects:<br/><br/>Activation Chits = these activate all units of the listed Corps or Cavalry Division. In some scenarios, Activation chits for the French player are fed into the game piece-meal to represent the slow reaction time of the French command structure. But the French player does have some options to speed up this process (see below). <br/>CIC Chits = these are special Activation Chits. The Prussian player has a Chief-of-Staff chit and the French player has a Commander-in-Chief chit. These chits allow players to select any one Division (for the Prussian player) or any one Brigade (for the French player) for activation - even if it has already activated or will be activated later in the turn. Thus, this is the opportunity to activate units twice in the turn. <br/>Event Chits = there are nine Event chits assigned to each player. At the start of a turn, players select any one of these chits to place in the cup (obviously an Event they really want). Three Event chits are randomly thrown out of the turn and will not be used &ndash; the remaining five Event chits are then placed into the cup with the pre-selected chit. In this manner, players are never assured of drawing any particular Event chit, except for the one they initially chose.<br/><br/>Each Event chit has a Unique Event side (all of which are different) and a Command (or Common) Event side. The Unique Event is tactical in nature and has specific effects and options for the player to consider. Event examples are Auftragstaktik, Krupp&rsquo;s Guns, Beaten Zone, Moulin a&rsquo; Cafe and Battlefield Conditions. The Command (Common) Event side is used for more strategic options. The Prussian player may attempt to speed up his reinforcements and/or change their arrival location and to curtail the effects of the Prussian Aggressive Tactics Event that the French player may play against him. The French player can use his Command Events to hasten his Activation chit availability and to attempt to cancel the effects of the crippling Bazaine&rsquo;s Malaise Event.<br/><br/>Prussian Strategic Movement: In order to add player input into the strategic off-map movement of the approaching Prussian forces, some scenarios offer the opportunity to use the unique hidden Prussian Strategic Movement system. This involves the Prussian player openly moving units on a special point-to-point map whose results, nevertheless, are hidden from the French player. This will vary where and when the Prussian forces arrive on the map. However, the system is set up so that even the Prussian player cannot be assured of the arrival time or the content of his forces. There will be a solitaire friendly version of this feature, as well.<br/><br/>MAP<br/><br/>The map is 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; hexagonal map of the entire west of Metz. Each hex equal approximately 500 yards and contains all the significant terrain details &ndash; elevations, slopes, woods, towns, quarries etc.<br/><br/>SCENARIOS<br/><br/>The game will include at least five scenarios:<br/><br/>Tutorial &ndash; a small, limited battle depicting the fighting around St. Privat on August 16th, which at one point resulted in 6,000 Prussian Guardsmen casualties being inflicted in 15 minutes! This scenario serves as a teaching experience for new players. <br/>The Battle of Mars-La-Tour &ndash; the whole battle beginning at 8:00 am and continuing the entire day. There are two variations offered &ndash; historical and free-setup deployments. There are also options for a historical reinforcements schedule or a variable schedule utilizing the Prussian Strategic Movement system. <br/>The Battle of Gravelotte-St. Privat &ndash; &ndash; the entire day-long battle. There are two variations offered &ndash; historical and free-setup deployments. There are also options for a historical reinforcements schedule or a variable schedule utilizing the Prussian Strategic Movement system. <br/>Campaign Scenario #1 &ndash; the game begins with the Mars-La-Tour scenario but continues past the first day until the campaign victory conditions are achieved.  <br/>Campaign Scenario #2 &ndash; the game begins on August 15th and the French player must march the entire Army of the Rhine across the map to escape to Verdun or, as a secondary option, protect the army from destruction. The Prussian army&rsquo;s movement is done entirely via the Prussian Strategic Movement system until they enter the game map. This scenario gives players the option to shape an entirely new campaign.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/><br/>1 &ndash; 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map<br/>2 &ndash; 9/16&rdquo; countersheets<br/>1 &ndash; Rulebook<br/>1 &ndash; Playbook (Scenarios, Historical Notes and Examples of Play)<br/>1 &ndash; Game Tracks Card<br/>1 &ndash; Prussian Strategic Movement Card<br/>4 &ndash; Player Aids (2 Prussian and 2 French) <br/>4 &ndash; Ten-Sided Dice (1 Blue, 1 Red and 2 White)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First printing"], "age": "12", "name": "At Any Cost: Metz 1870", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Chit-Pull System", "Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "8.16667", "usersrated": "6", "boardgamefamily": ["Blind Swords System"]}, "158816": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3492699.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Hermann Luttmann"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Rick Barber", "Charles Kibler", "Mark Mahaffey"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Revolution Games (II)"], "maxplaytime": "720", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3492699_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "720", "boardgamecategory": ["American Civil War", "Wargame"], "description": "Longstreet Attacks: The Second Day at Gettysburg is a game simulating the fighting on July 2nd, 1863 during the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg and focuses on the southern portion of the battlefield. These engagements involved General Longstreet&rsquo;s attack against Sickles&rsquo; positions, with troops from Hood&rsquo;s and McLaws&rsquo; Divisions, assisted as well by Anderson&rsquo;s Division of A.P. Hill&rsquo;s Corps.<br/><br/>The game is specifically designed to be a playable regimental-scale game that players can complete in a long evening. It allows the players the immersive experience of tactical combat without the heavy rules overhead normally found in such games, while also delivering a comprehensive experience of limited intelligence and unexpected events. The game features the Blind Swords chit-pull system which emphasizes the three &ldquo;FOW&rsquo;s&rdquo; of military conflict: fog-of-war, friction-of-war and fortunes-of-war. With each chit pull, players will be challenged to make tough decisions based on their assessment of the situation at that moment. Unlike traditional chit-pull systems, the Blind Swords system ensures that no combat units can be counted on, or conversely, counted out. This yields an environment of tense action and constant surprises &ndash; an environment that will challenge each player.<br/><br/>UNITS<br/><br/>All regiments and batteries of the Army of Northern Virginia and the Army of the Potomac that took part in these actions are represented in the Order of Battle. Each unit has a Strength Point number, with each point equaling 50 men or 1 artillery piece, and a Cohesion Rating, representing the unit&rsquo;s morale, training and experience.<br/><br/>SYSTEM HIGHLIGHTS<br/><br/>Combat and Cohesion System: The combat system is &ldquo;firepower&rdquo; based and utilizes the unit&rsquo;s size and Cohesion Rating to determine its effectiveness. The combat system is driven by a unique four-D6 dice mechanic. All four differently-colored dice are rolled simultaneously. The black and white dice generate an initial result ranging from 11 to 66. The other two dice (red and blue) simultaneously give the players the tangible effect of the initial result and represent physical casualties suffered by the unit (the red die) and the morale effect of the enemy&rsquo;s fire (the blue die).<br/><br/>Orders System: A player must first choose one of four possible Orders that an activated Brigade will operate under &ndash; Attack, Defend, Maneuver or Rally. Each Order has specific parameters that provide benefits and restrictions. This Order choice can be critical to a unit&rsquo;s performance during its activation.<br/><br/>Chit-Pull System: The Blind Swords chit-pull system is a unique mechanic and generates challenging actions and difficult decisions for the players. It features four different types of chits, all of which reside in the same cup, each with special effects:<br/><br/>Division Activation Chits. These activate any one Brigade (not yet activated) from the Division listed on the chit. However, further Brigade activations from this Division are dependent on the Division General&rsquo;s Command Rating and a die roll. A successful die roll places the chit back into the cup and thereby the other Brigades of the Division have a chance to activate in the future.  A failed die roll discards the chit for the turn and the remaining Brigades will not be able to activate normally (however, see below). <br/>CIC Chits.  These are a special kind of Activation Chit. The Union player has a Sickles chit and the Confederate player has a Longstreet chit. These chits allow the player to select any one Brigade in the game for activation - even if it has already activated or will be activated later in the turn. Thus, this is the opportunity to activate a Brigade twice in the turn or activate a Brigade from a Division that has lost its Division Activation Chit. <br/>Event Chits.  There are nine Event chits assigned to each player. At the start of each turn, players may select any one of these chits to place in the cup (obviously an Event they really want). Three Event chits are randomly thrown out of the turn and will not be used &ndash; the remaining five Event chits are also then placed into the cup with the previously pre-selected chit. In this manner, players are never assured of drawing any particular Event chit, except for the one they chose. Each Event chit has a Unique Event side (all the chits have a different Event listed) and a Command Event side. The Unique Event is a tactical event that can be used on the battlefield and each Event has specific effects and options for the player to consider. Examples are Rebel Yell!, Union Logistics, Quick March and Heroic Stand. The Command Event side is used for more strategic options. The Union player may call for reinforcements from the rest of the Army of the Potomac (only the III Corps Divisions are available at start) and the Confederate player can attempt to better coordinate his attack (by increasing his Division General&rsquo;s Command Ratings). <br/>Wild Chits.  These are the two &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; chits. One chit is Fog of War, which can possibly cause units from either side to conduct unexpected attacks or withdrawals, or can cause General officer casualties. The other chit is Fortunes of War which will immediately discard the next chit pulled with no effect &ndash; including that special pre-selected Event chit if it happens to come up!<br/> MAP<br/><br/>The map is 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; hexagonal map of the entire south end of the Gettysburg battlefield. Each hex equal 150 yards and contains all the significant terrain details &ndash; elevations, slopes, woods, swamps, buildings, orchards, etc.<br/><br/>SCENARIOS<br/><br/>The game will include at least five scenarios:<br/><br/>Tutorial &ndash; a small, limited battle depicting the fighting around the Wheatfield and which serves to teach the system to new players. <br/>Historical &ndash; the entire attack by Longstreet beginning at about 4:00 pm, using the historical deployment locations. <br/>Free Setup &ndash; the Historical scenario with the added flexibility of the player&rsquo;s being able to deploy their units as they see fit, within certain constraints. <br/>Sickles Stays Put &ndash; What if Sickles never made his infamous advanced deployment? This scenario explores what Longstreet&rsquo;s attack would have looked like if Sickles had stayed in line. <br/>No Countermarch &ndash; What if Longstreet did not lose so much time countermarching while heading to the southern portion of the battlefield?

Naught can also take advantage of new skills like jumping and diving to solve puzzles, avoid stalking creatures and fight dark monsters.

What should be an exciting encounter that leaves players on the edge of their seats holding their breath and wondering if they&rsquo;ll make it out alive instead winds up reduced to a few cursory rolls, and players either shrugging off the damage or feeling that they are being punished for not being paranoid about checking each and every hallway. There are ways to avoid this, of course, but wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to have some traps that are built specifically in order to be exciting and engaging encounters in and of themselves?<br/><br/>Enter the mythic trap: these dastardly devices make use of mythic rules and mythic power to come alive in your game, in more ways than one. A mythic trap acts like a monster or NPC, taking turns in initiative order, and using (under the GM&rsquo;s guidance) one or more of its devilish and hazardous components each round. They provide traps that are fun and engaging on several levels, and cannot be ignored in the same way that a simple pit trap or poison dart trap can be.<br/><br/>This book includes rules for mythic traps, which can be run easily in both mythic and non-mythic campaigns, and also provides three specific mythic traps to serve as examples. The chessboard trap is not only a maze of electrified tiles and hidden pit traps, but also pits players against magical statues representing chess pieces. Laugh as they try to fight their way past an army of pawns, dodge the sweeping rook juggernauts, and get blasted out of the air by beam-firing wizards. If chess isn&rsquo;t your thing, the clockwork horrors trap features all number of means to die: whirling blades, gouts of flame, pits and pendulums, and crushing hammers. There is no safe place to hide, but clever players that learn the trap&rsquo;s pattern may be able to avoid death long enough to find a way to disable it. Finally, the witch&rsquo;s cauldron trap features a particularly dangerous cauldron, which not only serves as a summoning portal for hordes of imps and mephits, and produces a noxious fog, but can even animate and boil victims alive. The only way to stop it? Mixing in the right ingredients. But with numerous options to choose from, and each wrong guess making things worse, success is far from guaranteed.<br/><br/>"}, "158845": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2019217.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Johnny O'Neal", "Chris O'Neal"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": ["Brotherwise Games"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2019217_t.png", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy", "Video Game Theme"], "description": "This limited edition promo card features Bast from Patrick Rothfuss's The Kingkiller Chronicles.<br/><br/>Bast is an Ordinary Hero, class Thief.<br/><br/>This card was released for a limited time only, along with its Epic Hero counterpart Bastas.<br/><br/>From the website description:<br/><br/>Introducing the brand new, limited edition &quot;Bast&quot; and &quot;Bastas&quot; hero cards for Boss Monster, a dungeon-building game inspired by classic video games.<br/><br/>Designed and donated by Brotherwise Games, these cards are available exclusively through our store, and they are in limited supply!

The map is mostly white as there had been a heavy, late snow in April that year.<br/><br/>COUNTERS AND MARKERS<br/>There are three general types of combat units: foot (infantry and grenadiers); mounted (cavalry and cuirassiers); and artillery. In addition, there are commander units.<br/><br/>HOW TO WIN<br/>Frederick II and his army were caught behind enemy lines with a large Austrian force lying between him and the rest of his kingdom to the north with his supply and communication lines cut off. The Prussian player wins the game if at the end of the game any Mollwitz Town hex is occupied by Prussian ordered foot units. The Austrian player wins immediately if Frederick II is killed. The Austrian player wins if at the end of the game the Prussian player does not capture at least one Mollwitz hex and at least 6 ordered Austrian infantry units remain on the field. Either side wins if the other should rout. Anything else is a draw.<br/><br/>SEQUENCE OF PLAY<br/>There are ten game turns.

After a few minutes, gunfire and hurrying footsteps on the roof can be heard. Heavily armed bandits have come to rob honest citizens of their wallets and jewels. Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company's weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top?<br/><br/>In Colt Express, you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases:<br/><br/><br/>    Phase 1: Schemin' Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck.<br/>    Phase 2: Stealin' The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player's best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights!<br/><br/><br/>The game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play.<br/><br/>Each player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they'll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a &quot;steal&quot; card when you're in a train car that holds one of these items &mdash; but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you'll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he's collected and is knocked into an adjacent car.<br/><br/>Each player's character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground.<br/><br/>You can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you're running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent's deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he'll be happy to give you a bullet, too.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Baltic first edition", "Chinese first edition", "Czech first edition", "English First edition", "English second edition Spiel des Jahres winner", "French first edition", "German first edition", "Greek first edition", "Hungarian first edition", "Italian first edition", "Japanese first edition", "Multilingual first edition", "Nordic edition", "Polish First edition", "Spanish First edition"], "average": "7.24707", "name": "Colt Express", "playingtime": "40", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Hand Management", "Memory", "Modular Board", "Take That", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["Brettspiel Adventskalender 2015", "Brettspiel Easter Basket 2016", "Colt Express: Cursed Loot", "Colt Express: Horses & Stagecoach", "Colt Express: Indians & Cavalry", "Colt Express: Le tunnel avant l\u2019arriv\u00e9e en gare", "Colt Express: Marshal & Prisoners", "Colt Express: North Pole Station", "Colt Express: The Time Travel Car"], "usersrated": "11554", "boardgameaccessory": ["Colt Express: Alternate Art Punch Cards", "Colt Express: Character Meeples", "Colt Express: Horse Tokens", "Colt Express: Playmat", "Colt Express: Rock Promo Accessoir", "Colt Express: Train Station Terrain Piece", "Colt Express: Twinples", "Colt Express: Wooden Game Pieces"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["3D Games"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["18.

The fight seems unfair as the seven of you might not seem to measure up to the dozens of enemies who want to slice you to pieces &mdash; but this comparison doesn't take into account your strong combat skills and an efficient team spirit that binds your samurai squad enough to face the threat. Above all else, when everything seems desperate and lost, your enemies will discover that inside each of you lies a true beast, a warrior spirit ready to unleash its full power!<br/><br/>Samurai Spirit is a co-operative game in which each player is a fierce samurai defending a village surrounded by a horde of bandits. The game plays out over three turns during which each player takes turns drawing bandit cards, then choosing whether they want to fight the bandit, defend the village, or let the bandit pass in order to help the other samurai.<br/><br/>The challenge of the game consists of balancing your choices: Should you fight each enemy to quickly reach your beast capacities, while also coming closer to the death and risking further loss by not defending the village sufficiently? Should you mainly defend or help the other samurai, taking the risk of remaining human too long and therefore weaker, when you know that weakness will be a major problem when facing the lieutenant and the villain bosses? Each enemy presents a tough choice to you, your team, and ultimately the whole village! Each turn ends with farms and fences being destroyed, and since those aren't unlimited, you must do what's necessary to end the game with at least one undamaged farm and enough farmers to tend it. Do you have what it takes to stand against evil and become a true hero?<br/><br/>Fight with courage, smartly assist your teammates, defend the poor villagers, turn into a savage beast, and wreak havoc on the enemy lines &mdash; all of this is up to you!

A pack of Red, White and Blue Cards, called Route Tickets, four STEAMSHIPS for travel on the water, and four TRAINS with Engines of color corresponding to the ships, for travel in Europe. It will be noticed that the trains of cars used in playing this game are like the European trains in appearance. Each player should take one STEAMSHIP and one TRAIN OF CARS of the same color. Each player should in turn draw a Red Ticket, without looking at it previously to taking it in his hand, and should put the prow of his Steamship upon the Red spot indicating the City first named on that ticket and from which port he is to sail. When traveling upon the WATER, Use the Steamship ; when going from CITY TO CITY IN EUROPE, each player should use his train as his piece, removing his Steamship from the board as soon as he begins to use his Train, and removing his train from the board when he again uses his Steamship. A player should put the front part of his Train on the City at which he is supposed to be. When ON THE WATER he should use the prow of his ship to indicate his position.<br/><br/>PLAYERS HAVING MADE THE FIRST MOVE continue in turn to move their pieces to the next place mentioned on their respective ROUTE TICKETS, thus: A player drawing the Route Ticket New York, Storm, Queenstown, Liverpool, and London: will it five moves, reach the latter point (using the Steamship from New York to Liverpool, then removing the Steamship front the board, and playing his Railroad Train from Liverpool to London). A player drawing the ticket New York, Rescue, Southampton and London, will, in four moves, reach the latter City, etc.<br/><br/>Players who prefer to use ordinary pieces instead of the Steamships and Trains of Cars, may use the four wooden pieces enclosed in the game, but if the Steamships and Trains are used, the wooden pieces are not. As a player moves his pieces, he must call out the place or city to which he moves. When a player reaches the last City named on his Ticket, he throws his Red Ticket aside (as it is not used again in the game), and continues to play and draw front White Tickets until he reaches Constantinople.<br/><br/>After a ticket has been used it is thrown into a discarded pile or placed under the bottom of the stack from which it was originally drawn. The players, by this process, eventually reach CONSTANTINOPLE, which is the turning point of the game.<br/><br/>AFTER REACHING CONSTANTINOPLE, a player must draw Blue Route Tickets, which will eventually bring him back to Boston or New York. The player making a TOUR OF EUROPE, as far as Constantinople, and first arriving at the last City mentioned on his return card (either Boston or New York), WINS THE GAME.<br/><br/>It will be seen that a player may make the trip very quickly, or that it may take a long time. The first Red Card that he draws will take him across the Ocean, but he may have to play upon the cities mentioned on several WHITE Cards before he reaches Constantinople, and he may draw several Blue Route Tickets after reaching Constantinople ere he gets back to Boston or New York.<br/><br/>N. B. &mdash; Players must move on EVERY City mentioned on EVERY Route Card they draw. Players can only move to the next City mentioned on Their Route Card, in one turn, therefore it will take six turns to reach the last City mentioned on a card having six names of Cities, etc. The red dots on the Ocean, such as Storm, Rescue, Fog, etc., supposed to represent incidents in the ocean trip, are used in the game exactly as the cities are.<br/><br/>GOING TO DINNER. It sometimes occurs that Two players meet in the same City, in which case they go to DINNER together, that is, both pieces are put upon the Dinner space, or picture, in the corner of the board. Players do NOT remain upon the Dinner space but remove to the next City on their routes (the Dinner only being an incident in their journey).<br/><br/>It does not require a SEPARATE turn to go to Dinner, the pieces being immediately placed on the Dinner picture on their meeting in any foreign City. Remember that you draw a Red Ticket on the first turn only. The White Tickets are used to carry you to Constantinople, and the Blue ones to bring you home. This will be easily remembered from the order, Red, White and Blue.<br/><br/>The board (from the 1st edition) sits on top of a wood framed bottom and there is a sliding drawer in the side for the game pieces to go into. The 2nd edition comes without sliding drawer.<br/><br/>"}, "158914": {"rpgdesigner": ["Frank Bohnsack", "Kevin Bratager", "Oliver Esper", "Arnold J.

Many of the Creatures in this half of the deck get killer bonuses for replacing Creatures that were already in play. It complements the Useless Swamp desire for a large discard pile as well.

Each mini will have a stat card with abilities, and players will have event/action cards they can play on their turn.

Epic Wars will not only have collectable enemies cards with different levels of rarity (different stats, XP, and rewards), but all the dungeon tiles, event cards, treasure cards, trap cards, etc... will have different levels. Players will determine if they want to &quot;free play&quot; or if they want to use a set scenario with different objectives to complete.<br/><br/>And while the &quot;wilderness tiles&quot; are sold separately, we will be including the &quot;dungeon tiles&quot; in the core game. The main reason for this is many people that play tabletop skirmish games probably already have terrain of some sort, while few will already have dungeon tiles.<br/><br/>I'm sure this write-up has raised more questions than answered. Our goal is to maximize depth and re-playability. There is nothing worse than getting a game you are excited for and end up playing once or twice because it has the depth of a melted ice cube. Epic Wars is all about expandability and customization. And depending on your luck with the card draws and dice rolls, you could have a wipe after 5 minutes, or an Epic War lasting all day.<br/><br/>At this time we are still early in design and all elements are subject to change.
