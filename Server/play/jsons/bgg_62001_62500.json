Most sages consider the area uninteresting wilderness. They couldn't be more wrong.<br/><br/>The Living Jungle is a Living campaign. This means that the actions and activities of players and writers affect what happens in the campaign. It also means that players create their own Living Jungle characters to play at conventions all over the world.

In other ways, it is very different.<br/><br/>Role-playing in Malatra is both simpler and more exotic then any other Living campaign. Magic is rare, with magic items virtually unheard of. True, there are shamans' potions and witch doctors' magic, but forget wielding magic wands and swords. In fact, forget swords altogether! In Malatra you rely on courage, guile, skill and speed. Spears, clubs and blowguns are the most common weapon, animal skins and leather the most common armor. Favored possessions may include tattoos, piercings, scars of battle, and even shiny rocks!<br/><br/>Think you have courage?

We&rsquo;re so desperate to belong. We&rsquo;ll do anything to make friends. To look good. To find some kind of companionship and affirmation, or some sense of spiritual satisfaction, real or false. Is it any wonder that in this World of Darkness cults spring up again and again, growing swiftly and without warning like a bad patch of choking weeds?<br/><br/>Thing is, though, very rarely does a cult start off as exactly that. No, they usually begin with more auspicious and beneficent ideals. A self-help group aims to better its members or, at the worst, its leader hopes to milk some suckers out of a couple bucks. But over time, it shifts. Each member relies a little too much on the group dynamic; they grow co-dependent, and instead of diminishing their desperation, it only blooms anew. It leaves a spiritual hole into which something bad may crawl. They&rsquo;ll fill the chasm with whatever they can: a demon&rsquo;s seductive whispers, a drink from a vampire&rsquo;s wrist, an infectious lunacy whose whispers will not&mdash;cannot&mdash;be refused. It may take a few months. It may take a dozen years. But over time, the cult mentality takes over. And sometimes, hunters must step in.<br/><br/>But what happens when it&rsquo;s hunters that grow to become the cultists? What happens when a cell or compact of hunters becomes mired in that cult mentality, opening themselves up to the callous manipulations of a monster?<br/><br/>Welcome to a Bad Night at Blackmoon Farm.<br/><br/>"}, "62085": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Robert Reaves"], "poll": [], "name": "Pacific Coast Trail", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic635546_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unpublished)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic635546.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Travel", "Trivia"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "The mode of travel in the game, hiking, introduces players to the situations and problems that are usually encountered while traveling from one location to another.

Suitable for interaction with a party of levels 7 - 13, they add some character to the Hobgoblin people; no longer will they be nameless faces who exist only to be slaughtered by adventurers. The company can be included in a campaign in many ways: they could be hired by the campaign's existing villain, be an ally of the party in the fight against said villain, or they could even overthrow the villain and Horthnog take his place. They could be the base of an entirely new campaign, or just used in a random encounter to add some detail. Horthnog himself is perfect to use as an end boss in a heroic tier game, or as an introduction to paragon.<br/><br/>This product contains everything you need to include the mercenary company into your games: descriptions, background, 2 adventure ideas and 15 encounter ideas using the mercenaries, including details on how to run a mass combat with the entire company. It includes 8 stat blocks for the different roles in the company, including the innovative standard bearer goblin minion lurker (leader), along with combat tactics. Finally, it includes a new skill challenge: finding a battle ground, and 9 pages of maps suitable for use with the Crimson Daggers as well as for many other combats!<br/><br/>Scrap that boring random encounter, and let your players meet Horthnog and the Crimson Daggers!<br/><br/>"}, "62103": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic606607.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Marco Bing"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "boardgamepublisher": ["PYXI"], "maxplaytime": "5", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic606607_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "5", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Book", "Children's Game", "Dice"], "description": "Pinky Li - The Bad Mushroom is book 1 in the Pinky Li Series.<br/><br/>It's a &quot;Game 'n a book&quot; you could say.<br/><br/>This book contains all of the following and is aimed at getting small children (4 to 7 years old) to read and play games at the same time!<br/><br/>- &quot;The Great Mushroom Race game&quot;<br/>- An illustrated storybook about the Bad Mushroom.<br/>- A Pinky Li Poster<br/>- A Pinky Li Games and Coloring Book<br/>- A book like box that can be turned into a 3D theatre<br/><br/>This Game in a Book is already available in English and French from the <a target='_blank' href='http://www.pinky-li.com' rel='nofollow'>http://www.pinky-li.com</a> website.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "name": "Pinky Li: The Bad Mushroom", "playingtime": "5", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move", "Set Collection"], "average": "5.4", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Children's Games"], "age": "4"}, "62104": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Mythweaver: Reckoning"], "statistics": [], "name": "Mythweaver: Reckoning (3rd Edition)", "rpgdesigner": ["Michael T.

Overland.<br/><br/>&quot;Upon the edge of the world, beneath the eves of the Darkenfold forest, lie the Elkhorn Deeps. Here, where men eek out a living in the shadows of the forest, lays the small berg of Lead Hill. With stone walls and stout towers Lead Hill is a sanctuary or sorts, where travelers may lower their guard and relax. For beyond those walls are the wilds, and the Darkenfold is an unkind place, peopled by dark forces, fey, eldritch powers, and creatures long dead whose still wander the earth.<br/><br/>Of all the dangers the people of Lead Hill face, the most horrifying came to pass. Two children, too young to know the world, vanished from their home, carried off into the forest by some foul minded creatures. Faeries love to torment the lives of men through their suffering children, so few are surprised. Though none know who did it, why, or how. They left only tell tale signs behind.<br/><br/>Of late a hag haunted the area, pestering Lead Hill&rsquo;s mage and its citizens, but they drove her into the forests. Harpies dwell in the woods not far and some have encountered the tree folk in the deeps. Other creatures abound and stalk the edge of wild, hunting for human prey. So none can say what has happened to the children, though all want them returned, or at the very least, those who lifted them, cast down and slain.<br/><br/>Enter the Elkhorn Deeps and attempt a rescue of the missing children! But be wary for things are not always as they seem and where allies and enemies work in tandem, great dangers often dwell.

This innovative card game uses each part of the card for different plays, even the backs!<br/><br/>In Conquest the card game, the object is to be the first player to capture the majority of landmarks.  Players are dealt 5 cards.  There are 9 landmarks in the game.  Players can set the length and difficulty of the game at the start by choosing 3, 5, 7, or 9 landmarks or choosing landmarks that are more difficult to reach.  Players move to different landmarks by playing cards from their hand that match the combination of terrain icons on each landmark card.<br/><br/>Each player assumes the role of one of 15 characters who may travel to different landmarks to try to take possession of them or duel opponent&rsquo;s character.  Players may also form alliances to avoid being attacked with the added bonus of getting the opportunity to secretly buy the allied player&rsquo;s land.  Some of the characters include samurai, pirate, spy, witch, and ninja.  Each character has a unique ability that players can use to gain an advantage.<br/><br/>Players also control armies and officers that can battle to take over other player&rsquo;s landmarks.<br/><br/>Conquest is not a CCG.  It is a complete game with a deck of 63 cards, however, because each card can be used in multiple ways, it feels more like a deck of 200.

Is a vampire worse than a witch because he cannot easily turn away from his monstrous state?

Imagine being handed some bloodsucker who claims he seeks redemption, and perhaps more importantly, he&rsquo;s got a head full of verboten information that he&rsquo;s willing to info-dump on anybody who will protect him and help usher him to his so-called salvation. Imagine receiving orders to keep this creature safe, a blood-hungry creature driven by a seething beast within, who&rsquo;s taken pleasure and gained life from the act of killing. Worst of all, imagine that this fiend has a whole hoary host of enemies, both hunter and beast, looking to make him pay for sins real and imagined.<br/><br/>Is reaching for another&rsquo;s redemption worth it?

Detailed history and descriptions of the races make them easy to learn about and simple to play. Tales of Gaea is the fantasy setting for the Iridium System.<br/><br/>Included with the Tales of Gaea book is the Iridium System Core Reference. This separate book is a useful reference for running not only Tales of Gaea but any of HinterWelt's RPGs. The ISCR is useful to both game masters and players as it will guide both through creation of races, character creation, spell creation and many other aspects of the Iridium System.

Unfortunately it seems to hold more weight in the modern age than ever. Over the last few decades, countries have fallen and economies collapsed. Multiple disasters, both natural and man-made, rocked the very foundation of numerous societies. Cowards of all sorts try to impose their beliefs on others through terror and intimidation. These things and more have left the average citizen wondering how safe and secure they really are at any given moment. In some cases, this has led many to shore up their defenses in the quest for peace of mind. The problem with this lies in the delicate balancing act of freedom versus safety. When exactly does the need for security begin to trample over liberty?<br/><br/>This was the root of the problem that initially faced the humble inhabitants of the small German town, Wolfsheim. This town long ago sold its independence to an iron-fisted tyrant in exchange for his horrific protection. Wolfsheim literally traded one evil for another, one that had disguised itself behind a veneer of civility and order. This town has become a tragic example of a population giving into those fears and of the price they must pay for doing so.<br/><br/>In Wolfsheim, the citizens are literally caught in the middle of a supernatural turf war between the fae monsters known as goblins and the Titan-serving werewolves of one Werner Krieger (originally seen in Scion: Demigod, pp. 288-289, though he is reprinted within for convenience). For untold years the citizens were forced by the goblins to participate in a yearly ritual, a macabre version of trick or treat called Kindernacht. When Werner Krieger came to the town&rsquo;s mayor with the promise to end the goblin&rsquo;s reign of terror in exchange for exclusive mining and industrial rights to the rich ore deposits nearby, it seemed the perfect solution. What the mayor (or the townsfolk) did not expect was to be dealing with yet another supernatural threat in the form of werewolves. The werewolves partially upheld their promise, only to steal the Kindernacht ritual and twist it into a yearly hunt of the children of Wolfsheim. Now the two inhuman forces fight each other for control of the town and its people, not caring who gets in their way. The story of Wolfsheim can be utilized as a side adventure in a long-running cycle, or as a stand-alone undertaking that can easily be modified from a modern setting to a WWII-era period piece (as detailed in &quot;The World at War&quot; section of the Scion Companion).<br/><br/>"}, "62204": {"rpgdesigner": ["John Alger"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "rpgseries": ["Primal"], "name": "Arms and Armor of the Stone Age", "rpgartist": ["Jole Grahn", "William McAusland"], "rpgproducer": ["John Alger", "Chris Cant"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic814795.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Bloodstone Press"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["History (Prehistoric)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic814795_t.jpg", "description": "From the Publisher:<br/><br/>Arms and Armor of the Stone Age features 59 weapons, 9 types of armor, 11 different shields and an assortment of miscellaneous equipment for primitive characters.

Instead of this the player puts his piece on top of the captured piece forming a stack.<br/><br/>- A player can move his piece to a square occupied by another player's piece. In this case the player puts the moved piece on top of the &quot;captured&quot; one the same way as it happens with opponent's pieces.<br/><br/>- A stack belongs to whoever owns its topmost piece, and moves as that piece does.

To pull off a decisive victory, he now had to force a crossing of the river and defeat the Austrians as swiftly as possible. On May 20 in mid-afternoon 200 skirmishers of Molitor&rsquo;s division crossed the backwater which separated the island of Lobau from the left bank of the Danube. By the next day, a beautiful Pentecost Sunday, the French were on the left bank with 30,000 men, including 6,000 cavalry, and were ready for battle. Grounded on the villages of Aspern and Essling and covered on the wings by the river, their base was solid. For his part, the Archduke Charles decided to go over to the attack quickly so as to destroy the troops who had just crossed the Danube. He had over 60,000 men available, organized into five columns, and before long the Austrians would have 90,000. After the battle had begun, several of the bridges over the Danube were temporarily broken, preventing the French from receiving the reinforcements necessary for victory. During the two days of May 21 and 22 the divisions on the ground, commanded by Mass&eacute;na and Lannes, would have to resist heroically as the enemy launched a series of massive assaults.

Another titanic struggle for global supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the varying animal species. <br/>Dominant Species is a game that abstractly recreates a tiny portion of ancient history: the ponderous encroachment of an ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth. <br/>Each player will assume the role of one of six major animal classes&mdash;mammal, reptile, bird, amphibian, arachnid, or insect. Each begins the game more or less in a state of natural balance in relation to one another. But that won&rsquo;t last: It is indeed &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;.<br/>Through wily action pawn placement, players will strive to become dominant on as many different terrain tiles as possible in order to claim powerful card effects. Players will also want to propagate their individual species in order to earn victory points for their particular animal. Players will be aided in these endeavors via speciation, migration, and adaptation actions, among others. <br/>All of this eventually leads to the end game&mdash;the final ascent of the ice age&mdash;where the player having accumulated the most victory points will have his animal crowned the Dominant Species. <br/>But somebody better become dominant quickly, because it&rsquo;s getting mighty cold...<br/><br/>Game Play<br/>The large hexagonal tiles are used throughout the game to create an ever-expanding interpretation of earth as it might have appeared a thousand centuries ago.

Each AP will allow a player to perform the various actions that can be taken, such as speciation, environmental change, migration, or glaciation. After being placed on the action display during the Planning Phase, an AP will trigger that particular action for the owning player during the Execution Phase.<br/>Generally, players will be trying to enhance their own animal&rsquo;s survivability while simultaneously trying to hinder that of their opponents&rsquo;&mdash;hopefully collecting valuable victory points (or &quot;VP&quot;s) along the way. The various cards will aid in these efforts, giving players useful one-time abilities or an opportunity for recurring VP gains.<br/>Throughout the game, species cubes will be added to, moved about in, and removed from the tiles in play (the &quot;earth&quot;).

The buildings will be placed within the grid and identified with control markers (wooden cubes) to show each player's contribution to the growing urban area. Each building's value is determined by the cumulative Wealth and Prestige values of the block in which is it constructed.<br/><br/>At the start of a player's turn he may discard one or more Building Permit cards from hand as &quot;Investments,&quot; gaining Wealth in doing so.

It is during this phase that events can occur, elections can be held for the various political offices, and players receive payouts in Wealth and Prestige. Wealth payouts provide funding for new buildings while Prestige payouts provide victory points.<br/><br/>Generally, players will be trying to build in areas that provide better payouts. Players are also looking to construct more buildings of a particular &quot;zone&quot;&mdash;Government, Residential, Industrial, or Commercial&mdash;in order to help them win an election, as the politicians each confer a special ability to the player holding the office. Many of the buildings also provide a one-time bonus as they are built, and players can benefit from construction in the right neighborhoods.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, the values of the buildings will generally increase as the town grows into a city and then a large metropolis. Neighborhoods that were once valuable can become run down and new city centers spring up as the urban areas sprawl out across the grid.<br/><br/>When the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring of each Prestige row, earn points based on accumulated Wealth, and score bonus points for political offices held&mdash;after which the player with the highest Prestige total wins the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "name": "Urban Sprawl", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Area Control / Area Influence", "Card Drafting", "Tile Placement"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "1788", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "average": "6.78057", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 8: Super Dungeon Explore: Forgotten King, Timecop, and Battleheart: Legacy", "Episode L \u2013 Ryan\u2019s Reviews", "I've Been Diced! episode 31: Three player games", "I've Been Diced! episode 50: Joel Toppen", "Ludology Episode 51 - 50 for 50, Part 2", "Spiked Eggnog Ho Ho Ho", "What Did You Play this Week Podcast Thing Week 79", "Wooden Cubes &amp; Iron Soldiers: \u201cJust the Two of Us\u201d Episode 8"]}, "62221": {"rpgdesigner": ["Paul Boughton", "Alan Crump", "Richard Edwards", "Chris Elliot", "David Langford", "Piers Massey", "Tim Metcalfe", "Tony Organ", "Qadille", "Johnny Razor", "Michael Scott Rohan", "The Quilldriver", "The Shambler", "Pete Thornhill", "Wayne"], "statistics": [], "name": "G.M.

This is a period that saw cavalry reign supreme, and pitted the European heavy cavalry &ndash; armored &ldquo;knights&rdquo; - system against the Eastern/Turkish light cavalry tactics.<br/><br/>Infidel is designed for quick learning and easy play. Game rules are short, there are no &ldquo;turns&rdquo; - play is Continual, with ample opportunities to steal play from your opponent - and combat resolution is a single dieroll.Playing time is about 1-2 hours, per battle.<br/><br/>Infidel is also GMT&rsquo;s gift to the gamer who enjoys playing solitaire. The system is designed for both individual and face-to-face play without any loss in insight or Fun. Each game is a &quot;paper time machine&quot; that allows players to see what happened in these famous battles and why.<br/><br/>The battles include:<br/><br/><br/>     Dorylaeum (1097): The Crusader line of march, including the people&rsquo;s Crusade and Peter the hermit, as well as all the great 1st Crusade Leaders, are &ldquo;ambushed&rdquo; by Kilij Arslan and his crack Seljuk cavalry.<br/>     Antioch (1098): The exhausted, starving and depleted Crusaders &ndash; they had few horses left &ndash; have just taken Antioch and are now faced with a large Turkish army, under Kerbogha, sent to retake the city.<br/>     Ascalon (1099): The Crusaders, having seized Jerusalem, turn south to fend off the suddenly active large army of The Fatimids, with their crack Mamluk heavy cavalry.<br/>     Harran (1104): Baldwin II of Edessa seeks to maintain control of his little kingdom in northern Syria, something Soqman, atabeg of Damascus, is not happy to allow. One of the first major Crusader defeats.<br/>     Montgisard (1177): Saladin attempts to destroy a small army from the Kingdom of Jerusalem with an army more than five times its size. Though there are only 400 knights, the Crusaders are led by the remarkable Baldwin IV, The Leper King. The outcome - one of the greatest Crusader victories.

As a tactical representation of naval warfare, each of the ships is accurately modeled for offensive capability including gunnery, ramming and spar torpedoes; for defensive capability including damage and five distinct armored or wooden hit locations; and for maneuverability, crew size and draft.<br/><br/>You command 70 famous ships of the era, including the Union: Onondaga, Tecumseh, Winnebago, Monitor, Osage, Minnesota, Brooklyn, Hartford, Essex, Carondolet, Kearsarge, Ossipee, Queen of the West, Iroquois, Spuyten Duyvil; and the Confederate: Tennessee, Virginia, Atlanta, Palmetto State, Arkansas, Albemarle, Alabama, Florida, General Beauregard, Sumter; and many more.<br/><br/>Many of the 14 scenarios, in this easy-to-learn game, are playable in an hour or less. Included are 13 historical and 1 hypothetical engagements featuring Hampton Roads, Mobile Bay, Trent&rsquo;s Reach, Wassaw Sound, the duel between Alabama and the Kearsarge, and the saga of the Arkansas, which may be played as three individual scenarios or as a linked mini-campaign.<br/><br/>In addition, forts bristling with guns make their appearance to challenge the will of the ship captains. If that was not enough to heat things up, scenario based optional rules add a few interesting &lsquo;what if&rsquo; situations to expand on play.<br/><br/>If you are interested in commanding your own fleet, Iron and Oak includes a standalone campaign module where player selected forces fight it out in the many rivers, bays, inlets and costal areas. The campaign game recreates the brown water actions, typical of the period, in a series of randomly generated battles. As play progresses, the players do not know the exact length of the campaign or the specific mix of the battles. Players must not only manage the unfolding battles, but must also strategically allocate resources and repair and refits their ships. The 16 card Navy Yard deck is used to plot a course through and influence the challenges of the campaigns.<br/><br/>Two or more players battle it out on an 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map that features an area movement grid. This simple approach controls ship movement as well as all combat action. Gone are the long periods of inaction, typical of ACW tactical naval games, as these early steam-era ships struggled to maneuver into battle.<br/><br/>This innovative game system places the emphasis on quick action and tactical decision making. The 50 Action Cards are used to assist and enhance play, not drive it. Each time you battle it out, whether in a scenario or campaign game, the action unfolds in a very different manner. Do you wish to employ hot shot or incendiary shells? Is now the best time to rapid fire or is it wise to maneuver and ram? Should you allocate part of the crew as a repair party? Is that enemy ship going to maneuver into your torpedo (mine) field? These and many other possibilities exist through the play of the action cards. Or, you may decide to not play any action cards at all and just maneuver and shoot. You control how and when the action will unfold.<br/><br/>At its core Iron and Oak is a naval simulation. It accurately models the close-range slugging matches typical of the period. You have the opportunity to play out the various battles to their conclusion. Will history repeat itself, or will a new account be written? Will the Monitor&rsquo;s 11&rdquo; Dahlgren smoothbores blast through Virginia&rsquo;s armor plating or will their battle again end in a stalemate? Will the powerful Tennessee win out against Admiral David Farragut&rsquo;s Union fleet or again fall to his superior numbers? Will the Atlanta defeat the two Union monitors in kind or again slip aground and strike her colors. This time, you get to determine the outcome.

It wasn&rsquo;t.<br/><br/>In the Middle East and South Asia, an Islamic revival was underway. Resentments bred in part of US support for the regions&rsquo; anti-Soviet tyrannies soon erupted into a new struggle against the West. Wealthy Saudi fanatic Usama bin Ladin issued a declaration of holy war against America in 1996 and then fired the first shots with spectacular terrorist attacks on US targets in East Africa in 1998 and the Arab Peninsula in 2000.<br/><br/>Bin Ladin&rsquo;s al-Qaeda organization plotted securely under the protection of the Taliban, a fundamentalist movement in Afghanistan born of the anti-Soviet &ldquo;Bear Trap&rdquo; of the 1980s. By 2001, al-Qaeda had set in motion even more devastating strikes &mdash; this time within the US Homeland &mdash; that Bin Ladin hoped would light off a global Muslim uprising. Uprising or not, the Western response to those September 11th attacks would reshape international affairs from London to Jakarta and from Moscow to Dar es Salaam.<br/><br/>Labyrinth takes 1 or 2 players inside the Islamist jihad and the global war on terror. With broad scope, ease of play, and a never-ending variety of event combinations similar to GMT&rsquo;s highly popular Twilight Struggle, Labyrinth portrays not only the US efforts to counter extremists&rsquo; use of terrorist tactics but the wider ideological struggle &mdash; guerrilla warfare, regime change, democratization, and much more.<br/><br/>From the award-winning designer of Wilderness War and later Andean Abyss, Cuba Libre, A Distant Plain, and Fire in the Lake, Labyrinth combines an emphasis on game play with multifaceted simulation spanning recent history and near future. In the 2-player game, one player takes the role of jihadists seeking to exploit world events and Islamic donations to spread fundamentalist rule over the Muslim world. The other player as the United States must neutralize terrorist cells while encouraging Muslim democratic reform to cut off extremism at its roots. With the game&rsquo;s solitaire system, a single player as the US takes on ascending levels of challenge in defeating al-Qaeda and its allies.<br/><br/>The jihadists must operate in a hostile environment &mdash; staying below the authorities&rsquo; radar while plotting terrorist attacks and building for the Muslim revolution. Will Iran&rsquo;s Shia mullahs help or hinder the Sunni jihadists? Will the gradual spread of Islamist rule bring final victory &mdash; or will it be a sudden strike at the United States with an Islamic weapon of mass destruction?<br/><br/>The United States has the full weight of its military force and diplomacy at the ready &mdash; but it can&rsquo;t be everywhere: will technological and material superiority be enough? US forces can invade and topple Islamist regimes, but how will the Muslim &ldquo;street&rdquo; react? And if quagmire results, how will the US find its way out?<br/><br/>Labyrinth features distinct operational options for each side that capture the asymmetrical nature of the conflict, while the event cards that drive its action pose a maze of political, religious, military, and economic issues. In the parallel wars of bombs and ideas, coordinated international effort is key &mdash; but terrorist opportunities to disrupt Western unity are many.

However, the original two games have been long out of print. GMT has considered a number of options to address that, from straight reprints to a base game/ campaign module arrangement.

It will contain a dozen full campaigns, over 200 aircraft cards, plus all of the necessary targets, resource sheets, and play aids needed for play.

However, they will not be simple reprints of those campaigns.  Wild Blue Yonder will contain three different types of campaigns, Land Campaigns, Progressive Campaigns, and Operations (The Schweinfurt Raids, for example). The first type will be the familiar &ldquo;standard&rdquo; DiF campaign to which players of the system are accustomed. Progressive Campaigns give both players a fixed &ldquo;order of battle&rdquo; along with reinforcements and replacements they will have to use throughout the campaign. This will reflect the more attritional nature of these air campaigns.

On the website of 999 Games you can find rules for two other games as well. Here follows a short description of the available games with the die:<br/><br/>Gezichtje Zoeken (Find the Smiley)<br/><br/>A player rolls the die. Now every player searches the thrown smiley on the playing field. The player that locates the smiley first gets a point. This game can be played until a certain amount of points is reached.<br/><br/>Bekken Trekken (Make Faces)<br/><br/>A player rolls the die hidden from the other players. He / she now has to make the face shown on the die. When another player guesses the correct face he / she earns one point and the performer earns two points. At the end of the game the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Dobbel 9 (Roll 9)<br/><br/>For this game you have to know that the &quot;playing field&quot; is devided in two halfs by a red dotted line and that the faces of the die occur many times on the playing field.<br/><br/>Both players use their own half of the &quot;playing field&quot; and throw the die in alternate turns. When a player throws the die, he / she has to mark the thrown smiley on the playing field. This way the players try to make a square of 3 * 3 marked smileys. The first player to reach this wins the game.<br/><br/>DOBBEL Bingo (DOBBEL Bingo)<br/><br/>DOBBEL Bingo works the same as Dobbel 9 but now you have to try to mark all smileys on your half of the playing field.

As an added bonus, counters that can be printed one or two-sided have been provided for almost every creature. The monsters presented here have all either evolved on or been trapped in a pocket plane of chaos and evil known as the Blasted Realm.

They possess armies consisting of skeletons, zombies and black knights. But the bewitched place is not going to surrender their treasures easily. Due to the cavern&rsquo;s sorcery, neither necromancer is able to distinguish his own soldiers: all of them look the same. So if he intends to win the battle, he will have to do it almost blind.<br/><br/>MATERIAL<br/><br/>A rectangular 4x5 game board (20 grey spaces).<br/>Six red pieces (monsters) for one necromancer and six black ones for the other. Each set will include one black knight, two zombies and three skeletons. The following symbols will be inscribed on one side of the pieces: a helm for black knights, a zombie&rsquo;s face for zombies and a skull for skeletons.<br/><br/>SETUP<br/><br/>At the beginning, the board is empty. Each player (necromancer) chooses one colour and takes the corresponding six pieces (1 black knight, 2 zombies and 3 skeletons). Those pieces will be set face down (symbols hidden). Therefore, the players will not know the identities of the members of their army (until they are required to be displayed).<br/>The board will be oriented so that there is a distance of five spaces between the players.<br/><br/>MONSTERS AND TEAMS<br/><br/>Any evil lord knows black knights are more skilled warriors than zombies, and zombies fight better than skeletons. So, when attacking, a black knight will defeat any other opponent; a zombie will beat a skeleton or another zombie but will be beaten by a black knight, and a skeleton will only defeat another skeleton. When attacked, a black knight will only be overcome by another black knight; a zombie will be beaten by a black knight or another zombie and a skeleton will always lose the fight.<br/>A player can decide to take the risk and join forces by forming groups (teams) of two (2-teams) or three (3-teams) pieces (putting one on another). In that case, the cave&rsquo;s magic determines that 2-teams always fight like a zombie and 3-teams always battle like a black knight, whichever the identities of their monsters may be.<br/><br/>MOVES<br/><br/>Every piece or team behaves the same way:<br/>-Move: orthogonal to an adjacent (and empty) space.<br/>-Attack: diagonal to an adjacent space occupied by a foe. Defeated pieces are immediately removed from the board and successful attackers take their position.<br/><br/>GOAL<br/><br/>A player wins when he gets rid of all his opponent&rsquo;s pieces, keeping at least one of his pieces on the board.

Like its predecessor, Fatal Alliances is all encompassing and represents every theater and aspect of the First World War. Fatal Alliances expands upon the military system of World in Flames to highlight the diplomatic and civilian fronts.<br/><br/>When we think of the First World War, we often think of miles of static trenches stretching along the Western Front. Indeed trench warfare was a huge component of the war, but many theaters in the Middle East, Russia, the Balkans, and even Africa were very dynamic &ndash; as even the Western Front was at times. Moreover, Fatal Alliances focuses on the major technological changes the war brought on, on land, at sea, and in the air. In order to prevail on the battlefield, you must coordinate artillery, elite ace-led air forces, gas units, shock troops, engineering units, infantry, cavalry, and early tanks.<br/><br/>The First World War was truly global, and in Fatal Alliances, the Eastern Front, the Middle East, the Caucasus, Africa, and even Asia and the Americas play a major role. German forces are loose in Africa, and South Africa's loyalty is uncertain. Italy will go to the highest bidder. The Ottomans face Russians in the Caucasus and British Forces along the Suez Canal. China is in turmoil, and could potentially join either side. Japan is nominally an Ally, but Japanese expansionism is already at odds with the interests of other Allied powers. Russia is primed for revolution, with Bolsheviks facing Tsarist forces in a battle for control of the largest swath of land in Eurasia.<br/><br/>To guide your nation to victory, you must navigate the world of international politics, swaying both minor and major powers to your side. Can you survive civil unrest or military revolution at home, while instigating it abroad? Can you prevent your troops from refusing to fight, and maintain control of your far-flung colonies? Strategic warfare on the seas and in the air must form a vital part of your strategy, preserving your nation&rsquo;s own will to fight while degrading the enemy&rsquo;s. Whatever your strategy, Fatal Alliances: The Great War is a truly dynamic and all-encompassing simulation of every theater of the First World War.<br/><br/>1680 counters represent the armies, navies, and air forces, which fought in the Great War. Two to five players make the strategic decisions that decide the fate of nations. What forces to produce, where to commit them, when, and how?

The Duces of Lorrein is a family game with a nice mix of existing and new game elements. It contains a new invented alternative to dice.<br/><br/>Goal of the game is to complete you mission card which states to build 4 specified workshops (Mill, Saw Mill, Stone Mill, Tannery (leather)). You start with just 1.<br/><br/>Turn sequence:<br/>1) Each player throws the chancebowl and gets raw materials (Wood, rock, animal, grain, lavender)(wooden pieces). <br/>2)The raw material has to be processed in a workshop in order to become a useful product (product cards). Because the other players have the other workshops you'll have to negotiate with them to get you material processed. This makes players dependent of each other. With the product card a player can build a workshop, farm, castle, big castle or a witchery.<br/>3)The final step is paying food for each castle. If a player doesn't have enough food, a game piece has to be taken away.<br/><br/>The winner is the player that completes his turn and mission card.<br/><br/>What makes the game interesting is the dilemma of being mutually dependent of your co player. Meanwhile each player wants to become independent by building your own workshops. For this you first need to negotiate with your co players. Becoming independent is often not on the road to completing you mission. So should you remain dependent and try to reach you goal asap, while running the risk of being blocked in the end, or should you try to become independent first and strong en your influence.<br/>Another element of influence in the game is the Mill. There is only one mill in the game. If someone else builds the mill, you lose it. Having the mill means controlling the food. You can use this position to get extra income or by starving and deterioration you opponents. Partner or Compete.<br/><br/>Another element is the game of positioning:  <br/>A workshop has to border a Castle. A small castle can have 2 workshops and a big castle can have 4 workshops. The castle has to be positioned between the 4 8-sided landscapes. Getting a good position with the correct landscapes around your castle is important. However, you opponents can block you by building farms, witchery or a workshop adjacent to your castle.<br/><br/>As an extra the game contains two additions in the manual which will strongly change the game. The first addition is the option to steal a farm if it isn't protected by an own castle or witchery. The second addition is to steal workshop by building a stronger castle.<br/><br/>All in all a very good balanced game, with a lot of dynamic and a great replayability.<br/><br/>"}, "62375": {"rpgdesigner": ["Alexander White"], "statistics": [], "name": "Crown of the Garamantian Sorceror-Kings", "rpgartist": ["Alexander White"], "rpgproducer": ["Alexander White"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic609550.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "average": "8.5", "rpgissue": ["Sub Rosa"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Contents", "Garamantian Breakthroughs", "Location: Pyramid of Phla", "New Creature: Cornossis", "New Creature: Garamantian Slave Ghost", "New Creature: Mummified Garamantian Slaves", "New Magic Device: Crown of the Garamantian Sorceror-Kings", "New Magic Device: Jewels of Tritonis", "Reviving the Slaver Kingdom", "Tamen-Set, Garamantian Sorceror-King", "Under the Rose: The First Sub Rosa Freebie"], "rpg": ["Ars Magica (5th Edition)", "Sub Rosa"], "rpgpublisher": ["Pointless Mental Cruelty"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic609550_t.jpg", "description": "This is a freebie issue of Sub Rosa, done outside their normal publishing schedule.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>Reviving the Slaver Kingdom <br/>Tamen-Set, Garamantian Sorceror-King<br/>New Creature: Cornossis<br/>New Creature: Mummfied Garamantian Slaves<br/>New Creature: Garamantian Slave Ghost<br/>New Magic Device: Crown of the Garamantian Sorceror-Kings<br/>New Magic Device: Jewels of Tritonis<br/>Garamantian Breakthroughs<br/>Location: Pyramid of Phla<br/><br/>"}, "62376": {"rpgdesigner": ["James D.
