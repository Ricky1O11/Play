For most of us, masks conceal uncertainties and doubts, ambitions and desires, and all the little secrets that make up what we think of as our true selves. For a few, masks conceal darkness, a dangerous beast just barely restrained by the chains of self-control. Sometimes, the chains break, the mask slips, and the horror begins.<br/><br/>Skinchangers in Shadow of the Demon Lord encompass a variety of shapeshifting creatures, from werewolves to ratmen and everything in between.

While just walking around and collecting things is one of the attractions, the players also compete (in global teams) to &quot;take control&quot; of bases &ndash; or, as they are called, &quot;Gyms&quot;.<br/><br/>There are roughly three types of possible encounters when walking around with Pok&eacute;mon GO &ndash; Pok&eacute;stops, Gyms and Pok&eacute;mon. Those already visible on the map when you turn the game on, are the Gyms and Pok&eacute;stops. Both of these are all based around noticable landmarks in the real world, like a church, a monument or a statue. Pok&eacute;stops are most common. Walking up to a Pok&eacute;stop and flicking the screen rewards the player with Pok&eacute;balls, or sometimes other useful items such as healing potions, eggs or revival crystals. A &quot;Gym&quot; is essentially a base that can be taken.<br/><br/>Pok&eacute;mon do not show up on the screen until the player is very close, although the game gives hints on what kind of Pok&eacute;mon are close by. When a Pok&eacute;mon shows up, a tap on the screen will start the catching seqence, where the player flicks his Pok&eacute;balls against the creature (which shows up on the mobile device's camera).<br/><br/>As the player checks Pok&eacute;stops and catches Pok&eacute;mon, he gains experience points. At a certain level, the player can start entering the Gyms, and partake in the battle to control them. The player is asked to join one of three teams, represented by Yellow, Red or Blue. All Gyms are coloured after what team currently controls it. A player can use his Pok&eacute;mon(s) to fight the current Pok&eacute;mon(s) on the base, regardless of whether it's a friendly or enemy base, but the rules differ.<br/><br/>When fighting a friendly base, the player challenges the Pok&eacute;mon(s) there with one of his creatures. If he defeats any of them, the base gains points. The base can thus level up: A level 1 base has room for only one (1) Pok&eacute;mon, a level 2 base has room for two, and so on, although each player can only keep one of his Pok&eacute;mons och eash base (Gym). So the more a player challenges his own team's base, the stronger it becomes, as he can create room for more Pok&eacute;mons to defend it.<br/><br/>When fighting an enemy base, the player challenges the Pok&eacute;mons there with six (6) of his creatures. If he defeats all, he has won the base, and it returns to neutral level 1. The player can then claim the base by placing one (1) of his own Pok&eacute;mon there (this Pok&eacute;mon will remain there until kicked out). However, if he defeats at least a few of the enemy Pok&eacute;mon but not all, the base loses points, and if it levels down, the lowest Pok&eacute;mon is kicked out of the base.<br/><br/>If a player repeatedely attacks a base, he can thus chip off the Pok&eacute;mons there and will eventually be attacking with six Pok&eacute;mon against the last one. This allows a lone player with several slightly weaker Pok&eacute;mons (but a lot of healing potions) to actually defeat a base, even if the Pok&eacute;mon(s) there are a bit stronger.<br/><br/>When caught, Pok&eacute;mons are assigned a semi-random strength, slightly depending on the level of the player. Catching a Pok&eacute;mon also gains the player food for that Pok&eacute;mon type. A Pok&eacute;mon can be powered up, or evolved, using food for its type. Duplicate Pok&eacute;mon can be turned in for extra food, to save up to evolve the strongest Pok&eacute;mon of that type the player has.<br/><br/>"}, "196102": {"poll": [], "name": "TransPlan", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android edition", "iOS edition", "Windows/Mac/Linux Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Physics"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["KittehFace Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone", "Linux", "Macintosh", "Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["KittehFace Software"], "description": "Transport a payload to its destination, using the laws of physics and a few simple tools!

Players will adopt one style of the characters dealt to them at the beginning of the game. Then all players will battle for supremacy using their character to defeat all comers. Game play is designed to depict extremely faced paced sword duels on the battlefield. 2-5 players will take part using only the core game. Games last 10 to 15 minutes. Expansions are planned to begin in early 2017.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/> After selecting their character players get  ready for the coming onslaught by selecting stances, choosing an attack or item and finalizing their plan of attack. However, we all know that on the battlefield even the best laid plans do not survive contact with the enemy. Players will simultaneously select their actions and who they will attack each round. Upon being attacked combatants will be able to parry or even redirect the attack just like in a true sword fight. This &ldquo;ebb and flow&rdquo; of combat will persist as long as it takes to declare a winner. This is no easy task as every decision will devastate either your enemy or yourself. You will inevitably find yourself asking questions like what stance I  need to be in next, should I block or should I hold for a bigger attack, is the opponent faking their threat level, and can I get my attack off before theirs? In any event this high stakes sword fight will have you coming back again and again.<br/><br/>How do we know you will like it?<br/>BC Games focuses on making quality games over a quantity of games. For this game we consulted Marty Katz Shihan, Shichidan (7th Dan in Bushido), founder of Bushido Karate Dojo in an effort to add a large shot of realism to the flow of the game. We even had the maneuvers translated into Japanese (with subtitles) and cross referenced them so some of the maneuvers block and counter others specifically like they do in the real world. You will enjoy this game for its realism and attention to detail regarding the art of Bushido and the way of the warrior. The Samurai put all they had into their training and ability as an honorable but lethal force at the altar of war. Now you can live out your dream of an amazing duel of your own.<br/><br/>"}, "196137": {"rpgartist": ["Peter Frain", "John Ossoway"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Last Witness", "rpgdesigner": ["John Ossoway"], "rpgproducer": ["Newt Newport"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2944616.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["River of Heaven"], "rpgpublisher": ["D101 Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Hard Sci Fi)", "Science Fiction (Space Opera)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2944616_t.png", "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>Almost a century ago, against the better advice of the Hegemony, the Solar Witnesses despatched the Revelation - an antimatter torch ship - on a pilgrimage to the Machine Civilisation Polis in the Altair star system.<br/><br/>IT NEVER CAME BACK.

Conflict is resolved using a standard deck of 52 cards in a system that is intuitive, fun, and simple to use.

Gather your crews and set sail for adventure on the high seas in Rum &amp; Bones: Second Tide!<br/><br/>Based on online MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) style games, Rum &amp; Bones has 2-6 players taking control of legendary pirate heroes, each with unique powers and abilities, as their crews fight over Davy Jones' legendary treasure!<br/><br/>Players each control up to five heroes at any time, moving them across the game board in an attempt to destroy various key features on their opponents' ship. Victory is obtained by destroying enough of these features. Your heroes are not alone, however, as your crew also consists of deckhands and bosuns who, while not controlled by the player, will work on a simple AI to wreak havoc on the enemy!<br/><br/>Of course, what would pirates be without plunder? And in Rum &amp; Bones the most sought after treasure are Davy Jones' mythical pieces of eight! Players amass these powerful coins during gameplay to unleash devastating abilities and attacks from their Heroes, crushing all enemies before them until only they remain!<br/><br/>This game is both a stand-alone and compatible as an expansion to Rum &amp; Bones. In Rum &amp; Bones: Second Tide, 2 to 6 players will take control of one of two deadly pirate crews: The mysterious and monstrous Deep Lords, who seek to claim Davy Jones&rsquo; treasure in an effort to flood the world and reshape it to their liking, or the Marea de la Muerte&cedil; a crew of ruthless gold-seeking Spanish cutthroats who will stop at nothing to claim the treasure for their own greed!<br/><br/>Players control teams of three to five heroes, depending on the number of players, each with various and unique powers and abilities. These Heroes are drawn from five different classes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses:<br/><br/>     Captains: Jack-of-all-Trade Heroes who specialize in buffing other Heroes.<br/>     Brutes: The toughest of the tough, Brutes can take a ton of punishment and only get stronger for doing so!<br/>     Gunner: Ranged damage dealers, Gunners have the lowest HP of all classes, but can also dish out the most hurt.<br/>     Swashbucklers: Like Gunners, Swashbucklers specialize in dealing damage, but prefer the up-close-and-personal approach.<br/>     Quartermaster: While they don't deal the most damage, Quartermasters make up for it in raw utility: specializing in healing and buffing Heroes, and also enhancing your Deckhands and Bosuns!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The most notable change to gameplay is their new &quot;dynamic Leveling System&quot;. Now each Hero begins the game with their Basic Attack skill card. As they gain Coins, which are obtained from KO'ing enemies and Objectives, they can use those Coins to buy new skills, as well as level up existing skills! Also, they've introduced a new &quot;Alternating Activation&quot; method of play where players will take turns activating 1 Hero (or their Crew), and then their opponent will do the same, continuing back and forth until everyone has gone.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "maxplaytime": "75", "average": "8.18648", "name": "Rum & Bones: Second Tide", "playingtime": "75", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Action Point Allowance System", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Modular Board", "Variable Phase Order", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": ["198584", "198779", "202686", "198890", "217667", "198326", "225974", "198325", "198405", "198923", "217669", "202684", "217670", "202680", "225975", "202681", "198449"], "usersrated": "307", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Rum & Bones"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 017 \u2013 Our Podcast Subscriptions", "Episode 24: One Year Anniversary - Jamie Keagy of The Secret Cabal", "RDTN Episode 114: They Who Were 8, Rum &amp; Bones Second Tides, &amp; Fuzzy Tales", "The Dice Steeple #24 - Interview of Theocracy (Christian Metal Band)"]}, "196203": {"poll": [], "name": "Russian Front", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android edition", "iOS edition", "Windows/Macintosh Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3343017.png", "videogametheme": ["Military", "War - World War II"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Electric Rune"], "videogamegenre": ["Simulation", "Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPad", "Macintosh", "Windows"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["HexWar"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3343017_t.png", "description": "Russian Front is our most ambitious strategy game yet, an operational-level game with a wider scope than any of our previous titles.

Command massive armies at your fingertips, in this fully 3D turn-based simulation of one of the largest military campaigns in history, playable as both Germans and Russians. Start in the early days of Operation Barbarossa and follow the German invasion of Russia through to its ultimate failure.

Four shorter Operations, spanning 16 turns each, take place from June to December of each year and offer a more condensed experience. The bitter weather on the Eastern Front was as much a danger as the opposing forces, and the game reflects this with a seasonal cycle that has a profound effect on your tactics as you struggle to hold out through the vicious Winter until reinforcements arrive in Summer. Players must also deal with fog of war effects, and will be able to cut off their opponent&rsquo;s supply lines, while making sure their own stay secure.<br/><br/>Key Features:<br/><br/>Play the colossal 108 turn campaign, or pick from 4 other points in history to start from.<br/>Large 3D map representing the entire Eastern Front; stretching from Berlin to Stalingrad.<br/>Play as both the Soviet and German army, each with unique tanks, vehicles and uniforms.<br/>4 Historical Operations: Barbarossa, Case Blue, Citadel and Bagration.<br/>Real historical Corps and Armies from several countries.<br/>Strategically reinforce units in vital locations.<br/>Selectable difficulty to tailor your experience to your play style.<br/>Hours of Gameplay<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "196204": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing", "HTML Korean Version \ube14\ub799 \ud574\ud0b9", "PDF Version 1.0", "PDF Version 1.2"], "poll": [], "name": "The Black Hack", "rpgdesigner": ["David Black"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2945633.jpg", "usersrated": "10", "average": "8", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["The Black Hack"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)", "Gold Piece Publications"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2945633_t.jpg", "description": "(publisher blurb)<br/><br/>The Black Hack is a super-streamlined roleplaying game that uses the Original 1970s Fantasy Roleplaying Game as a base, and could well be the most straightforward modern OSR compatible clone available.

Ireland is a poor country, but there is no lack of enthusiasm for railways among investors. Up to 13 5-share companies will start in a random sequence. Some of these companies will become successful, others, as a result of underinvestment, isolation or poor timing will struggle to survive. All is not lost for the strugglers, however. A unique shareholder voting mechanism allows companies to merge into 10-share companies(sometimes against their director&rsquo;s wishes) with their more or less successful neighbours.<br/>Track laying provides its own problems as many track tiles are unique. Often, there is no available tile to provide the most efficient route so a roundabout route sometimes must suffice. There are two types of track that can be built: broad gauge and narrow gauge. There are no purchasable narrow gauge locomotives; instead narrow gauge track operates in an abstract way and boosts the value of the broad gauge stations to which it connects.  <br/>Trains in 18Ireland are hex trains. They become obsolete in two stages: rusted trains may be bought back from the bank at half price (but also half capability) and continue to operate until they rot and are then removed. As the game progresses the train rush becomes brutal.

Experience has shown that at a low player count, this is a &ldquo;run good companies&rdquo; game. At a higher player count, the game is more combative as share portfolios are more diverse and the hostile merger becomes a bigger factor in the game.

This allowed FS4 users to quite easily build, on the fly from directly within the program, custom scenery units known as SC1 files which could be used within FS4 and traded with other users (this activity was quite popular in the FS Forum on CompuServe). Also, ASD provided the addition of the Aircraft Designer Module. Again, from directly within the program the user could select one of two basic type aircraft frames (prop or jet) and proceed to parameter customizations ranging over 4 pages of flight envelope details and visual aspects. Finally, ASD provided additional aircraft including a B747 with a custom dash/cockpit (which required running in 640 &times; 350 resolution).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, History of Microsoft Flight Simulator, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "196222": {"poll": [], "name": "Flight Planner for Microsoft Flight Simulator", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English DOS / Windows 3.x release"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2946760.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Flight"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Bruce Artwick Organization, Ltd.", "Mallard Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS", "Windows"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Mallard Software"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2946760_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Although it does not require the Microsoft Flight Simulator to run the Flight Planner for Microsoft Flight Simulator can hardly be considered an independent stand-alone title.

The Eastern front of World War II saw some of the most ferocious fighting, as the Red Army and the Wehrmacht pitted ever more powerful tanks against each other. While the early years of the war saw the Soviets struggle to withstand the German Blitzkrieg, the later stages saw the Red Army counter-attack in great force.

He enjoyed it there because it had loads of different<br/>places  to  play,  not like his Mum's garden with its clipped lawn and tidy<br/>flower  beds.  And anyway, he could show of his brilliant marble collection<br/>to the other kids there.<br/><br/>This  particular evening, though, there was nobody else in the park.  As he<br/>walked through the gates sunlight dimmed, as though a storm was coming; and<br/>suddenly the sky was filled with black clouds.  A strong wind picked up and<br/>whistled  through  the trees, creating...  well, an interesting atmosphere,<br/>let's  put  it  that  way.   For added effect, it also rustled up some dead<br/>leaves  from  the  ground  and showered them in all directions.  This would<br/>have  unnerved most people, but not Ruff.  He'd seen all this kind of stuff<br/>before,  mostly  when he was daydreaming in a boring History lesson, and he<br/>was  ready  for  any  nasty  things that might come for him from out of the<br/>woods.  It was then he saw it; just a glimpse out of the corner of his eye.<br/>A  bright  light, shining into the trees from just across the other side of<br/>the path.<br/><br/>He padded carefully towards it, holding his heavy bag of marbles tightly in<br/>both  hands, ready to swing it into action should anything horrible appear.<br/>As  he drew closer, he noticed that the source of the light, a tiny hole in<br/>the  ground,  was  marked  with  an equally tiny sign, which read:  WANT TO<br/>PLAY?<br/><br/>An arrow pointed towards the hole.<br/><br/>Ruff  looked  around, just to make sure that nobody was playing tricks with<br/>him  (and  so  he didn't look stupid to any of his friends, of course), and<br/>then  knelt  down  before  the  light.   Reaching his hand into his bag, he<br/>pulled  out a marble:  a big, red shiny one; his favourite kind.  Carefully<br/>he  aimed  towards the hole, and fired.  Plop!  The marble rolled down, out<br/>of sight.<br/><br/>Almost  immediately there was an unearthly roar from under Ruff's feet, and<br/>the  ground  began  to shake violently.  Still kneeling, he started to sink<br/>into  the  earth, and he tried - too late - to get to his feet.  The ground<br/>collapsed, and he fell into a brilliant white light.  Ruff landed, heavily,<br/>in  a  tree-lined  cave.  He rubbed his grazed knees and elbows, and looked<br/>up.   Curiously, the hole he had just fallen through had disappeared.  Even<br/>more  strangely,  his  bag  of marbles had gone; and a large gun lay nearby<br/>with a note attached to it.  The note read:<br/><br/>`Master  Rodgers,  I'm  afraid  i've  had  to confiscate your marbles, dear<br/>fellow.   I'm incredibly evil, you see, and I need them to power my supreme<br/>machine which will help me take over the world!  Ha ha ha!'<br/><br/>A sudden clap of thunder made Ruff jump.  Bloody theatrics, he thought, and<br/>then read on.<br/><br/>`But  because  I'm  a  sporting  kind  of chap, I've decided to allow you a<br/>chance  to get your marbles back.  Grab the gun, climb into the teleporter,<br/>and  you'll  be  taken  to my secret netherworld.  Of course, you've got no<br/>real hope:  even if you get all the marbles, I'll just have to kill you.<br/><br/>Yours  evil-ly Doctor Destiny' &quot;Oh yeah, you and whose army?&quot; shouted Ruff,<br/>to nobody in particular.  As though in answer the note continued:<br/><br/>`PS.   Er,  my  army,  actually.   I  built  them  myself.  I call them the<br/>Tinheads, and they're programmed to blow the pants off anybody who tries to<br/>come  and  take  the marbles away.  Especially you, of course, my dear boy.<br/>To rise to my evil challenge and face them, climb into my clever teleporter<br/>and prepare to meet your Destiny!  Ta-ta.'<br/><br/>Almost  immediately  he read the words there was a blinding flash, and when<br/>the  smoke  cleared,  before him stood a bright metal box - a sort of steel<br/>phone booth.  A door in the side opened, revealing another sign:  IN HERE.<br/><br/>He'd  never  heard  of theso-called `Doctor Destiny' before, but already he<br/>was  building up an intense dislike for the man.  Anybody who calls himself<br/>such  a jumped-up name must be a bit of a megalomaniac, he thought.  And in<br/>all  the  movies,  it's always the megalomaniacs who eat their words in the<br/>end.<br/><br/>Confused,  but  annoyed  that  the rotten git had taken his prized marbles,<br/>Ruff  scooped  up  the  gun  and  ammo,  swung  them over his shoulder, and<br/>clambered  into  the  teleporter.   How  tough  can these Tinhead things be<br/>anyway?<br/><br/>"}, "196402": {"poll": [], "name": "Gargoyles", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North America Sega Genesis version"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Disney Interactive Studios, Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["SEGA Genesis"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Disney Interactive Studios, Inc."], "description": "From the Game Box<br/><br/>Blast through 1,000 years of gothic adventure with the stone-crushing strength of the legendary Goliath.

In the game, you control the French forces and must try to defeat the invading English forces in the Battle of Agincourt, which was fought on October 25, 1415. Your forces are represented by cubes and strength dice. You must move your cubes along a simple point-to-point map, but your movement will be hindered ever step of the way by English arrow fire. Your goal is to move two of your cubes into the English line, which will disrupt it and allow you to capture Henry V.<br/><br/>The game uses a CDG system similar to games like We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage (albeit on a much smaller scale). Each turn you will play a card from your hand using it either for its action points or as an event which can aid your play. As you perform actions, such as movement and combat, you will draw special event cards that present new challenges.<br/><br/>The game is played using a total of 9 cards and a handful of cubes and dice. One card contains the map for the game and the other eight cards contain the game's events. Each event card has three separate events on it 1.) Player Event 2.) Movement Event and 3.) Combat Event. You will only need to look at the relevant event for the current phase of the game.<br/><br/>Each turn is played out in a series of phases.<br/>1. Card Play Phase<br/>2. English Archer Phase<br/>3. Combat Phase<br/>4. Victory or Loss Check Phase<br/><br/>Despite the small number of components and short playing time, the game presents a challenging experience and interesting historical narrative for this famous battle.

Lord British). Originally written in BASIC and published in 1980, it is one of the earliest commercially available CRPGs. The game was reprogrammed in assembly and rereleased in 1986 with a greatly improved running speed, better graphics and a few minor content changes.<br/><br/>The game uses a top down, third-person view using icons for the main character, monsters, cities, towns, dungeon entrances and other places of interest in the overworld. The game switches to a simple 3-D, one-point perspective view during dungeon and tower exploration.<br/><br/>The main character, a hero from another world, is brought to the land of Sosaria to defeat the evil wizard Mondain who is devastating the land with hordes of creatures from the standard fantasy roster. Setting a precedent for most CRPGs to follow, the hero improves his skills and equipment until he is powerful enough to complete the final quest and defeat Mondain.<br/><br/>User Summary from the Ultima II entry:<br/><br/>Ultima II: Revenge of the Enchatress is the second game in the Ultima series by Lord British, aka. Richard Garriot. The game uses similar mechanics to Ultima I, a top down icon based landscape for above ground with a 3D line drawing engine for dungeons and towers. Including time travel and travel to the planets of the solar system, it is the most unique in tone of all the Ultima series. Including the first of the cloth maps that would become a staple of the Ultima series.<br/><br/>Ultima II finds time being corrupted by Mondain's apprentice Minax. As revenge on the Hero from another world for defeating her master Mondain, Minax has travelled back in time and changed Earth's history, hoping to wipe out the hero. Lord British has rescued the hero so he can avert this disaster and defeat Minax. To do this he will have to travel through time and space, searching for the one way to defeat the Evil Enchantress.<br/><br/>User Summary from the Ultima III entry:<br/><br/>Ultima III: Exodus is the third game in the Ultima series by Lord British, aka. Richard Garriot, and is the final story in the Ages of Darkness Trilogy. Using similar game mechanics as the previous two games;a top down icon based view of above ground and a simple line drawn 3D engine for dungeons, it introduces new game features, the most important being able to play with a party of heroes, and the introduction of Moongates. The game also does away with the Sci-fi features of the first two games and remains in a completely fantasy based setting.<br/><br/>Sosaria is being plaqued once again by hordes of evil creatures roaming the lands. A new island has risen from the depths in a conflagration of fire, the only entrance of which is defended by the Great Earth Serpent. The only clues are fragments of manuscript hinting at an unholy alliance between Mondain and his apprentice Minax, and a single word inscribed in blood on the deck of a derelict ship: Exodus.

Will you emerge victorious or become another casualty of war?<br/><br/>Key Features:<br/>High Definition Medieval Era Graphics.<br/>7 Mission Tutorial Campaign.<br/>4 Mission Breton Campaign.<br/>8 Mission Edwardian Campaign.<br/>All missions, except the tutorial, can be played as both sides.<br/>Over 30 Unique Medieval Units.<br/>Detailed Combat Analysis.<br/>Flank Attacks.<br/>Strategic Movement.<br/>Hours of Gameplay.<br/>Detailed Reference Charts.<br/>Map Zoom.<br/>Additional Purchasable Campaigns on iOS<br/>8 Mission Lancastrian Campaign.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "196495": {"poll": [], "name": "Exhale", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable Edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Horror"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Owl Cave"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Owl Cave"], "videogamecompilation": ["The Charnel House Trilogy"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>This sequel to the game Sepulchre (which also has a prequel called Inhale) starts with a man waking up on a train and seeking to find out what is going on.<br/><br/>"}, "196496": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2998436.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Warfighter: The Tactical Special Forces Card Game"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Dan Verssen"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Dan Nance"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Dan Verssen Games (DVG)"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2998436_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Wargame", "World War II"], "boardgamehonor": ["2016 Golden Geek Best Wargame Nominee"], "description": "Warfighter is a card game for 1 to 6 players. You play cooperatively with your friends against the system to complete World War II squad-level combat missions.<br/><br/>The core game and 4 expansions provides you with all the cards you need to play as, or against, the Americans, British, or Germans in post D-Day Europe.<br/><br/>This includes the soldiers, weapons, equipment, and tactics used by each of those nations. Everything you need to create your own unique squad of soldiers!<br/><br/>At the start of each mission, you each select one or more Player Soldiers, equip them with skills, weapons, and combat gear within the mission's Resource limit. You then fight your way through hostile territory and engage enemy soldiers, as you attempt to reach and complete your mission objective. Every mission is a stand-alone game. You build your Soldiers, select your Gear, and then run your mission. Within 30 to 60 minutes you will have succeeded or failed.<br/><br/>Warfighter uses a new combat system that takes into account the fire mode you select for your weapon, range to the target, running out of ammo, suppression fire, and cover - all in the same dice roll!<br/><br/>This system creates an incredibly deep narrative with every attack. As you eliminate soldiers, you gain experience to Upgun your Action cards, play Support cards, and activate special Skills.<br/><br/>There are 3 levels of Soldiers in Warfighter: Player Soldiers, Non-Player Soldiers, and Squad Soldiers.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edtion"], "average": "8.00376", "name": "Warfighter: The WWII Tactical Combat Card Game", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": ["199162", "214558", "214555", "214556", "199163", "215207", "214561", "214559", "214552", "214994", "214993", "214557"], "usersrated": "186", "boardgameaccessory": ["Warfighter: The WWII Tactical Combat Card Game \u2013 Expansion #14: USA Metal Solider Miniatures", "Warfighter: The WWII Tactical Combat Card Game \u2013 Expansion #15: UK Metal Solider Miniatures", "Warfighter: The WWII Tactical Combat Card Game \u2013 Expansion #16: German Metal Solider Miniatures", "Warfighter: The WWII Tactical Combat Card Game \u2013 Expansion #17: Russian Metal Solider Miniatures", "Warfighter: The WWII Tactical Combat Card Game \u2013 Expansion 13: Metal Tokens"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "196497": {"poll": [], "name": "Yardmaster", "videogamemode": ["Asynchronous Multiplayer", "Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iOS edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Card / Casino Games", "Commercial / Public Transport"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Greenfly Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["iPad", "iPhone"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Crash Games"], "description": "The cargo is rolling into the yard and it&rsquo;s up to you to organize and manage it, making sure everything is where it&rsquo;s supposed to be and readying your train for departure.<br/><br/>In Yardmaster, 1-5 players are racing to see who can load their train first while adhering to the connection rules (Railcars may only connect if they are the same type of cargo or the same number.)<br/><br/>The first player to fully load their train becomes the Yardmaster!
