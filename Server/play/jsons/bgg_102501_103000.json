Four elemental properties were part of the change: fire, cold, energy, and poison. If the elemental properties were high enough, items changed color to reflect elemental power.

It introduced a new land area to the game, the continent of Kunark, which had been previously unexplored. Through a mix of in-game events and fiction published on the web by Verant Interactive, the storyline of the discovery of Kunark was established.<br/><br/>In terms of the game, The Ruins of Kunark had a very different visual feel compared to the original zones in EverQuest: the color palette was more vibrant and many of the models used for the monsters were more detailed. This detail was most evident in the Iksar, a new playable race of lizard people introduced with the expansion. The Iksar had a number of racial advantages, including the ability to stay underwater for longer periods of time, additional regenerative powers, and an armor bonus. This was balanced by the fact that they were hated by all of the other races in the game and that there were very few places they could go without being attacked. They also could not wear plate armor.<br/><br/>The Kunark expansion also increased the maximum level a character could attain from 50 to 60, and introduced a substantial number of new and powerful monsters for characters above level 50 to fight. The most notable of these was Veeshan's Peak, a zone populated by dragons that was, at its release, declared to be the hardest zone that would be put into EverQuest. In reality, the zone quickly was surpassed by other zones released in further expansions, and is in fact not used often by players.<br/><br/>Another notable and deep dungeon is Sebilis, the lair of the undead dragon Trakanon, which required players to level past the previous limit and obtain improved gear introduced in the expansion.<br/><br/>The Ruins of Kunark was also the focus of 'epic quests', or quests for powerful weapons for each character class, which were introduced between the Kunark and Velious expansions as a source of further high-end content.<br/><br/>The Kunark expansion was unique in its method of distribution. A player would order the expansion from Verant's online store, and it was then shipped directly to the player's home. Unforeseen shipping delays caused many players to miss the expansion's official opening date. Thereafter, most EverQuest expansions were either available in local stores, or downloaded directly from Verant, many weeks before the official opening date.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "102532": {"poll": [], "name": "Arma 2: Free", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "6", "videogameseries": ["ArmA"], "videogametheme": ["War - Modern"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["Bohemia Interactive Studio"], "videogamegenre": ["First Person Shooter", "Flight Simulator", "Real Time Strategy", "Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "description": "Arma 2: Free (A2F) redefines the free-to-play battlefield with its truly unrivalled scale and gameplay possibilities.

SOTMI picks up where its predecessor left off: Just as your character Mina was about to leave the island, a sudden volcanic eruption brings down the aircraft that came to rescue her.<br/><br/>Once again, Mina ends up as a castaway on an apparently uninhabited island somewhere in the South Pacific. A monkey pet named Jep saves Mina&rsquo;s life.  As the title suggests, you&rsquo;ll solve lots of secrets that will fill in murky bits from the first game. For example, you&rsquo;ll find out why Captain Nemo never escaped the island. SOTMI employs an old trick that breaks monotony &ndash; switching between Mina and Jep who have distinct abilities and their own inventories. For example, Jep can reach places that are outside Mina&rsquo;s reach, he can tap his highly evolved sense of smell to find objects, and even communicate with other monkeys via a special interface. Mina can dive in the lake, combine items, use complex tools, and read the documents.<br/><br/>This being a sequel, everything is bigger and larger than in the first game so brace yourself for even more exploration, puzzles, and objects to collect. The inventory system remains unchanged and revolves around using a specific object at a certain place or combining several objects into a new item that solves a puzzle. For example, combine a hook and bait to cast a fishing rod.

You can add to your menagerie by breeding two animals of the same species, and even by cross-breeding two different species (often in defiance of all laws of nature). You also have to set up snack stands, install sidewalks, hire staff, build a few restrooms, oh, and you better pick up all the trash that visitors drop.<br/><br/>All in all, a classic management game in the SimX-spirit. The animals, facilities, land-expansions, etc. are bought with two different currencies, &quot;Coins&quot; and &quot;Stars&quot;.

Early in the game, you will only earn a few hundred coins from your zoo, but anything you want to buy will cost far more than that (example: a hedgehog is 16,000 coins).

The expansion focuses on high-level content (levels 35 and up), providing many extremely powerful monsters to fight and a number of zones meant to be used by large groups of players.<br/><br/>The expansion takes place on the continent of Velious, an icy continent towards the south of Norrath. The title refers to three chasms in Velious that are said to be the place where the great dragon Veeshan struck the continent with her claws. One of these claw marks is believed to be in a zone known as The Great Divide, an area where the Coldain have established their home in the mountain side.<br/><br/>The expansion introduced both Frost giants and Coldain dwarves to the EverQuest universe, as well as a new sect of dragons known as the Claws of Veeshan. Players could ally their characters with any of the three factions, and fight against the others to gain rewards exclusive to their chosen faction.<br/><br/>The expansion is also notable for introducing the Sleeper's Tomb zone, a locked zone that players could unlock with a key from a quest, and vanquish the four dragons that guarded The Sleeper, a very powerful beast that should never be unleashed. The first players completing this zone led to the first world changing event, where The Sleeper would awaken and rampage his way through Norrath. This however also led to some controversies as the zone itself would change and some items that used to be available before the awakening would no longer be present.<br/><br/>Scars of Velious also reintroduced Ethereal Planes such as the Plane of Growth, home of Tunare (goddess of nature) and the Plane of Mischief. Those planes, just like the original Planes (Hate, Fear and Sky) required players to have reached the level of 46 in order to enter. Plane of Growth also reintroduced the notion of Planar armor, providing a full set for each class.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;EverQuest: The Scars of Velious&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "102557": {"rpgdesigner": ["Daniel Myers", "Chrissy Walles"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Hall of Fire (Issue 59 - Mar 2009)", "rpgartist": ["Ted Nasmith"], "rpgproducer": ["Jeff Ifland", "Micah A.

The expansion focuses on high-level content, providing a number of zones meant to be used by large groups of players and many extremely powerful monsters to fight.<br/><br/>The expansion takes place on a moon of Norrath called Luclin and introduced the Vah Shir, a catlike playable race, and the Beastlord character class. Notable NPC races that were added to the EverQuest universe are the Shissar, a snake-like race, and the Akhevans. The Shadows of Luclin also incorporates a new game engine, new character models, and gave players the ability to design graphical user interfaces. The player characters' appearance was completely redesigned giving them more layers and rounder shapes. Mounts were also introduced with this expansion, they allowed players to regenerate their Health and Mana as if they were sitting without generating as much aggro (hatred from monsters). Alternate Advancement started with the Luclin expansion, allowing players to further grow and customize their classes.<br/><br/>It includes many zones in which players of all levels can experience, several raid encounters such as the Lord Inquisitor Seru and a high-end raiding zone, Vex Thal. SoL also introduced some new events that made encounters more challenging than before, especially in the Ssraeshza Temple zone.<br/><br/>The Shissars, serpent like creatures, were extremely powerful beings and once roamed on the continent of Kunark where they had enslaved the Iksars. Rile, an Iksar hero, brought a revolution and called upon a mystical force referred to as the Greenmist, which killed the Shissars. Fleeing Norrath because the atmosphere became toxic, the surviving Shissars were helped by the Combine Empire and were sent to Luclin and the underwater sanctuary introduced years later with &quot;The Buried Sea&quot;.<br/><br/>On Luclin, the Shissars built the temple of Ssraeshza home of the powerful Emperor Ssraeshza (powerful enough to slay gods according to the lore). To protect themselves from the Greenmist, they magically sealed the Grey, a place where no atmosphere exists, and built their temple. Ssraeshza Temple (also known as Ssra) is part of the access to the high end zone of Vex Thal. Defeating the Emperor was necessary and required equipping every player with a key done within the temple and gearing melee characters with special weapons, since the Emperor is immune to regular weapons. Such weapons were introduced with SoL and a referred to as Bane Weapons. Later on, a Shadow Knight only quested weapon was introduced in Cabilis and called the Greenmist (Sacred Khukri of Rile), the most powerful Shissar-bane weapon.<br/><br/>Under the seas they built Zhisza a new sanctuary.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "102563": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Hall of Fire (Issue 64 - Sep 2009)", "rpgdesigner": ["Joel Sanda", "Chrissy Walles"], "rpgproducer": ["Jeff Ifland", "Micah A.

The expansion was released in 2002 and comprises an assortment of otherworldly planes that do not exist in a planetary sense within the EverQuest universe.<br/><br/>The expansion added content to the game aimed specifically toward the high-end player. In addition to adding new zones to the game, the expansion also introduced a network of portal points through the game realm. Players could use them to quickly travel to and from various regions through a central plane, known as Plane of Knowledge.<br/><br/>The primary goal, or end-quest, of The Planes of Power is access to the Plane of Time. Access to this plane can only be obtained through vanquishing the four elemental deities or avatars of such: Fennin Ro, The Rathe Council, Coirnav and Xegony. To gain access to all of the zones of the expansion and successfully enter the Plane of Time, the players needed to complete 28 flag events of all sorts, involving the death of planar deities and deific creatures. These encounters can only be completed with the organized effort of up to 72 players working together simultaneously.<br/><br/>In order to enter the expansion's zones, a player had to reach the former set planar level of 46. Once the character reached level 55 he gained access to two more zones which are the Plane of Valor and the Plane of Storms. At 62 the Bastion of Thunder then became available. Those level limits can be bypassed by completing the progression of the expansion, allowing for example to be level 46 while adventuring in the Bastion of Thunder. The maximum level was increased from 60 to 65 with this expansion and new Particle Weapons were added, when before only epic weapons had such visual effects.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;EverQuest: The Planes of Power&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "102569": {"poll": [], "name": "EverQuest: The Legacy of Ykesha", "videogamemode": ["Massively Multiplayer"], "videogameversion": ["North American Windows edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1731293.jpg", "videogameseries": ["EverQuest"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "5", "videogameexpansion": ["EverQuest"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Sony Online Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["MMO", "RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "6.4", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sony Online Entertainment"], "videogamecompilation": ["EverQuest: Platinum Collection", "EverQuest: The Anniversary Edition", "EverQuest: Titanium Collection"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1731293_t.jpg", "description": "EverQuest: The Legacy of Ykesha (also known as LoY or Ykesha) was the fifth expansion pack and only extension pack for the EverQuest MMORPG. Promoted by Sony Online as EverQuest's &quot;first download-only extension&quot;, it was the first EverQuest content expansion available almost exclusively from Sony Online's direct purchase and download service. Due to overwhelming demand, a limited number of CDs were made available to retailers after the product release date. Ykesha was released in February 2003 and was considered a minor content addition at the time. Over time, Ykesha's &quot;extension&quot; designation was lost and the product is now referred to as a full fledged EverQuest expansion.<br/><br/>The Legacy of Ykesha introduced the froglok (the frog-like humanoid race present since the original EverQuest was released) as a playable race. To do this, Sony Online Entertainment introduced a storyline whereby the frogloks invaded the Troll city of Grobb and reclaimed and renamed it Gukta. The trolls were sent fleeing to the city of Neriak. Another part of the storyline introduced the Broken Skull Clan of the trolls, which had a rivalry with the Grobb trolls, and live on the island of Broken Skull Rock just off the south coast of Antonica. This is where the new zones of the expansion are located.<br/><br/>Other enhancements of the expansion included dyeable armor, an increase in the number of bank slots available for characters, a new guild management system, a new armor slot called 'Charms', and a new overhead mapping system which allowed players to customize maps.<br/><br/>The zones were intended for mid-level adventurers between levels 36-60 and were generally received as very uninspired and added little to the lore of Norrath, however the guild management, extra bank slots, trading between characters utility and mapping tools are considered vital, and dyeing of armor is very popular.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;EverQuest: The Legacy of Ykesha&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "102570": {"poll": [], "name": "EverQuest: Lost Dungeons of Norrath", "videogamemode": ["Massively Multiplayer"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Windows edition", "German Windows edition", "North American Windows edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1731286.jpg", "videogameseries": ["EverQuest"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "5", "videogameexpansion": ["EverQuest"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Sony Online Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["MMO", "RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "videogamehonor": ["2004 D.I.C.E.

However, purchasers of the retail box version were rewarded with an in-game item (a magic bag), starting Sony's trend to include in-game items as incentive to purchase retail copies of their expansions.<br/><br/>Lost Dungeons of Norrath introduced broad-based instanced dungeons to Norrath, revolving around tales of the Wayfarers - an NPC adventuring organization. Players complete adventures for the Wayfarers in one of five different dungeon themes. Each dungeon theme has about ten different variations of the zone, and players can also choose the type and difficulty of their adventure. When the adventure is finished successfully, players are awarded Adventure Points which can be spent on items, spells, and 'augments' at the Wayfarer camps.<br/><br/>Augments were introduced in Lost Dungeons of Norrath and allow players to enhance existing items by adding an augment to them. Existing items in the game had generally only a single augment slot, so only one augment could be added. Items purchased at the Wayfarer camps occasionally had up to three slots available to augment.<br/><br/>In addition to group adventuring, the Wayfarer camps also offered raid content, in which multiple groups could challenge difficult high-end content.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;EverQuest: Lost Dungeons of Norrath&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "102571": {"poll": [], "name": "EverQuest: Gates of Discord", "videogamemode": ["Massively Multiplayer"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Windows edition", "German Windows edition", "North American Windows edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1731284.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "5", "videogameexpansion": ["EverQuest"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Sony Online Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["MMO", "RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "6.4", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sony Online Entertainment", "Ubisoft Entertainment S.A.

The expansion focused on high-level content, providing a number of zones meant to be used by large groups of players and many extremely powerful monsters to fight.<br/><br/>The introduction of this expansion in early 2004 was beset by numerous serious quality issues. John Smedley, President of Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) has described the release of this expansion as &quot;SOE's worst mistake in five years&quot;.<br/><br/>The GoD expansion takes place on the continent of Taelosia and expands upon the storyline introduced in Lost Dungeons of Norrath. In GoD, the Wayfarers Brotherhood discovers a new continent across the seas from Odus, and the known areas of Norrath. The wayfarers set up a base in the new lands of Taelosia, and provide the transportation system that allows players to teleport to the new continent quickly. As players explore the storyline, they find that the former inhabitants of Taelosia have practically disappeared, and evil creatures are roaming abroad. Players are challenged by the Wayfarer Brotherhood to find out who or what is behind this new evil that now inhabits Taelosia.<br/><br/>The expansion features 20 new NPC models, and 18 new zones. There are 10 single-group instanced trials, 8 uninstanced exp zones, and 9 raid zones/instances. All of the zones in GoD are designed for higher level (50+) characters, and many of the raid zones require level 65 before they can zone in.<br/><br/>In GoD, the Berserker character class is also introduced. Berserkers are a melee class that use 2-handed weapons along with special class abilities to double attack and intimidate their opponents, as well as going into attack frenzies. Berserkers can both take and dish out a good amount of damage. They start off with the Corroded Axe combat skill for creating throwing axes and a 2-handed Axe, so new players can get right into combat at level 1 without delay. They also have spell-like conventional combat abilities, such as striking a target's leg to slow him down (like a snare spell), striking his head to stun him, or cutting him to make him bleed (like a Damage over Time spell).<br/><br/>An In-Game &quot;Casino&quot; was introduced in GoD as a money sink for the players. This was in response to a serious cash exploit in the game at that time that threatened the virtual economy of the game via economic mudflation. At the &quot;casino&quot;, tokens are purchased from a bar maid in the Shadow Haven zone and turned in for prizes. Prizes are typically meager stat foods or gems. However, lucky players could win a golden ticket, which can be turned in for extremely rare magic items that have previously been removed from the game.<br/><br/>Also included was an updated tradeskill interface with numerous new recipes. Tradeskill combine containers have been upgraded to include recipe lists (which can be searched, by resulting item name or tradeskill difficulty range). The new interface also allow players to combine items without opening up inventory bags to find the components. This allows players to easily make several tradeskill combines in a short amount of time. The new tradeskill containers are available to all players, but items for the new recipes can only be found in GoD zones.<br/><br/>GoD introduced the tribute system, an alternate money sink the developers created to take cash out of the game system. Scattered throughout the home cities of all character races are Tribute Masters who act as vendors. Players can donate items or coin to the Tribute Masters and earn &quot;tribute points&quot;. Tribute points can then be used to increase stats, increase resists, increase HP / mana pools or regen, or gain spell-like focus effects (water breathing, increased damage foci, improved healing foci, etc.). The abilities gained through Tribute Points are all on a timer; once activated points get deducted at a certain rate depending on what tribute effects were selected. A later expansion introduced guild Tribute points, which stack with personal Tribute Points.<br/><br/>Leadership Alternate Abilities (LAA) are also a new feature introduced in GoD. Similar to normal AA, Leadership AA is an Opt-In system. Once opted in, 20% of the group leaders XP will go to Leadership abilities that will enhance play when they are the leader of a group or raid. Leadership abilities include neat features like increased mana, increased hit points, increased HP regen, increased ATK, special targeting circles to help the group target the correct mob, marking a path to lost players, etc.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;EverQuest: Gates of Discord&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "102572": {"poll": [], "name": "EverQuest: Omens of War", "videogamemode": ["Massively Multiplayer"], "videogameversion": ["North American Windows edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1731288.jpg", "videogameseries": ["EverQuest"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "5", "videogameexpansion": ["EverQuest"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Sony Online Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["MMO", "RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "6.4", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sony Online Entertainment"], "videogamecompilation": ["EverQuest: The Anniversary Edition", "EverQuest: Titanium Collection"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1731288_t.jpg", "description": "EverQuest: Omens of War, often abbreviated as OOW or Omens, is the eighth expansion released for EverQuest, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG).

New features include new zones, a new player race known as the &quot;Drakkin&quot;, an attainable player level of 75, as well as new spells and alternate advancements.<br/><br/>The expansion was added with the aims of making soloing (playing Everquest alone rather than as part of a larger group) a more viable option. This was done through the addition of a new town, home of the newly added Drakkin race, which provides various tasks for all levels of game play to gain experience, gear, and money. The advertisements for &quot;The Serpent&rsquo;s Spine&quot; stated that one could go from level one to level 75 without a group or exploring any of the previously existing locations in the game simply through completion of these newly added tasks.<br/><br/>The Serpent's Spine expansion also added the rest feature, allowing players who have been out of combat for a short period of time to regenerate mana and health at a drastically increased rate. This effect was added to aid those soloing, as well as to solve complaints about down time or med time spent meditating to regenerate lost mana. While generally greeted well by the Everquest community there have been complaints about the new rest effect causing class balancing issues. This is due to the ability for some classes to expend their mana rapidly to cause large amounts of damage only to regenerate it with the new rest effect in the time it takes for their group to kill a single monster, thus increasing the total damage done in a group compared to the previous method of conserving mana to ensure a steady supply. This causes classes that are unable to utilize this method to decrease in their comparative effectiveness.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;EverQuest: The Serpent's Spine&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "102578": {"poll": [], "name": "EverQuest: The Buried Sea", "videogamemode": ["Massively Multiplayer"], "videogameversion": ["North American Windows edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1731292.jpg", "videogameseries": ["EverQuest"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "2", "videogameexpansion": ["EverQuest"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Sony Online Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["MMO", "RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "8", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sony Online Entertainment"], "videogamecompilation": ["EverQuest: The Anniversary Edition"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1731292_t.jpg", "description": "EverQuest: The Buried Sea (TBS) is the 13th expansion pack released for EverQuest, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG).<br/><br/>TBS is the thirteenth expansion for the EverQuest universe, released in 2007.

(Ubisoft)"], "description": "Might and Magic: Heroes Kingdoms is a real-time strategy massively multiplayer online game played through an Internet browser. Different game worlds are available, each of which can hold a limited number of players. Each game world consists of a tiled map of regions. Players choose a game world to play on and each is given control of a city within one of the regions. Each region is itself made up of a 25 zones (5 by 5 tiles) with the city at the centre. Four of these zones contain mines which provide resources to the city while others are open ground. Each zone in a newly acquired region is populated with an army of non-player character (NPC) troops which must be defeated before mined resoures can be collected or before buildings can be constructed on the open ground.<br/>The city houses a hero character and the player's troops. Structures can be built within the city to enable the hiring of new heroes, the training of additional troops, the researching of spells, and to provide other bonuses. Heroes can lead troops into battle, can improve mines and construct build buildings in the zones surrounding a city, and can establish new cities in other regions. They gain experience points from performing these actions and, as they level up, can learn trades and skills to boost their performance in battle or the city's economy.<br/>Players must organize themselves into alliances for protection and to obtain the &quot;Tears of Asha&quot; which are required to win the game. Each game last approximately 6 months and players can then start a new game and receive bonuses in the new game world based upon their achievements in the previous game world.<br/>The economy of the game requires the collection of gold, common resources (ore and wood) and rare resources (mercury, crystals, sulfur and gems). Gold is used to recruit and maintain heroes and troops, and to pay for structures and buildings. Common resources are required to build basic city structures. Rare resources are required for specialist and magical structures and to recruit high level troops. Since each city has only four mines, other resource-types must be purchased or looted. Trades can be made with other players or with an NPC merchant. As players establish new cities in regions with a different set of four mines, they become increasingly self-sufficient.<br/>Each player is one of four races, Haven, Academy, Necropolis and Inferno. Each race has different skills in combat and magic and requires different rare resources for their respective specialist structures and troops.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Might and Magic: Heroes Kingdoms&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "102616": {"rpgdesigner": ["Henri Anemaat", "Eric Boschman", "Oswin ten Brinke", "Jake de Oude", "Niek Ederveen", "Jeremy Falger", "Han Heidema", "Ren\u00e9 Raap", "Ton Segers", "Peter Stallenberg", "Maurice Strubel", "Frank ten Hoonte", "Frank van den Bergh", "Ruud van der Graaff", "Maarten van der Werf", "Hans van Halteren", "Peter Hein van Mulligen", "Pascal van Oorschot", "Marcel van Ravensberg", "Det Wilmink"], "statistics": [], "name": "Spel!

Alliances can be formed near the beginning of the game to help the player. However, the alliance is only effective until the enemy alliance is defeated. Then the former allies declare war on each other. Victory through a cunning alliance is impossible because game rules dictate that there can only be one winner at the end of the game; that is why the two former allies need to go to war in order to claim the victory. Peasants have to do engineering tasks as well as military tasks. For example, bridges, monster-filled caves, and fences can be created or destroyed for the purposes of strategy. With each successful victory, peasants become soldiers and eventually knights.<br/><br/>Players can play in either campaign (which consists of helping a king eradicate a rebel force) or battle mode (where the player has to take on three rival kingdoms simultaneously while expanding his nation). This simplistic diplomacy system can never be used in a match after 5 minutes in the game, making it useful only for delaying war with a neighboring kingdom. Human units as well as orcs and demons are used for peasants, soldiers, and knights. Also, a leader can be either a warrior, a magician, or a shaman.<br/><br/>The player even has a leader avatar that must liberate hanged men from the gallows to be his assistant, collect treasure chests from the countryside in order to gain a mass influx of gold, and to force nearby cities to pay taxes. This turns the city's banners into the player's colors and at a random time, a taxman appears and goes to the player's castle to give him gold pieces to help with the war effort.

Someone shuffles the six garlic cards and places them face-down on the game board, then players mix the spider and orange juice drink tokens face-down, place them on the game board, then draw one at random and place them on their bed.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player rolls the die. If she rolls a number, she moves that many spaces clockwise or counter-clockwise on the rugs on the edge of the game board. If she lands on an empty space, her turn ends. If one or more players are already on that rug, she chooses one of them, then draws a face-down token and places it before her without looking at it. The chosen player draws and reveals another token. Each player then makes what they think is the appropriate noise for these two items hitting one another: &quot;clink&quot; if two glasses, &quot;oomph&quot; if two spiders, and &quot;splash&quot; if one of each. The active player reveals the hidden token: If both players were correct, they each claim one token and place it on their bed; if only one player was correct, she claims both tokens; and if no one was right, the tokens are placed face-down on the board again.<br/><br/>If the player rolls a garlic bulb, everyone screams &quot;Garlic!&quot; then tries to get in bed because their screaming probably roused Dad, who will be annoyed to find them out of bed. Here's how this works: The active player reveals the top garlic card. If it shows a closed trap door, then each player moves one rug toward their bed (or onto their bed if they are already on their rug). If all vampires are in bed, stop turning over cards; if not, turn another card. If Dad shows up on one of the cards, every vampire out of bed loses an item while vampires in bed may take an item as a reward.<br/><br/>When a player has eight items on bed, players hold a garlic round. If this player reaches bed before Dad arrives, she wins; if not, she loses an item and the game continues.

Wherever the final piece is placed, the player takes the action associated with that bowl; in addition, if the colored pieces in that bowl match the colors shown on a Trajan tile next to the bowl (with tiles being placed at the start of the game and through later actions), then the player takes the additional action shown on that tile.<br/><br/>What are you trying to do with these actions? Acquire victory points (VPs) in whatever ways are available to you &ndash; and since this is a Feld design, you try to avoid being punished, too. At the Forum you try to anticipate the demands of the public so that you can supply them what they want and not suffer a penalty. In the Senate you acquire influence which translates into votes on VP-related laws, ideally snagging a law that fits your long-term plans. With the military, you take control of regions in Europe, earning more points for those regions far from Rome.<br/><br/>All game components are language neutral, and the playing time is 30 minutes per player.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition 2013 with GAMES 100 \"Game of the Year\"", "English/German first edition", "Italian second edition", "Multilingual edition 2012", "Multilingual Masterprint edition 2012", "Multilingual second edition 2011"], "average": "7.81593", "name": "Trajan", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Set Collection"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "9488", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Ancient Rome", "Quined Master Print Edition Series"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["8.

A Science Fiction Collectable Card Games without an equal. Do you like Firefly, Battlestar Galactica, Babylon 5? Hull Breach! features a unique science fiction world with many of your favorite elements of each.<br/><br/> From the rulebook:<br/><br/>Hull Breach! is a tactical, operational, and strategic space-combat and logistics card game for two or more players.<br/><br/>Each player has his or her own deck of cards consisting of a Station, ships, modules, Marines, technological breakthroughs, events, and tactics. Players compete head-to-head to destroy each other's fleets and space station; the last player or team standing is the victor.<br/><br/> Gameplay:<br/><br/>Players choose from a variety of pre-constructed decks or can assemble their own, then each player takes turns either building up their base or building ships to attack their opponents. First player to destroy (or take over from boarding action) is the winner.<br/><br/>Each faction/deck has a unique power and varied amounts of resources generated each turn. With these resources you can add on modules to your base, or play ships/marines to the table. Your base functions as a mothership where your subsequent ships make up the fleet you will use for offense and defense. Each turn you will get more resources based on your base and the modules attached (which can add to your resource generation).<br/><br/>The ships and marines have different special abilities such as stealth (to avoid enemy detection). Some ships can even retrieve more ships from your deck at no cost.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved with d10s.

It provides a unique interpretation of the common fantasy races and monsters for game play. The game can be scaled from a small handful of figures up to several dozen.  Players can customize their own figures, individualizing them with skills and building them up with experience both within a single game and from game to game. The rulebook provides a variety of scenarios, including everything from straight up battles to dungeon crawls to an assault on a wizard's stronghold.<br/><br/>Unlike other miniatures games, a figure is not killed with 1 or 2 wounds. Each figure is given a specific set of points sources that represent both its health and effectiveness. As a figure is wounded, it becomes less effective throughout the course of the game.  The combat system is simultaneous and figures make opposed rolls for both offense and defense to determine combat results.<br/><br/>In addition to the point sources, figures can be &quot;trained&quot; in different skills including weapons, armor, magic, and many other types of special abilities. Figures with different skills can be combined in an endless variety of ways to create effective combat and adventuring squads.

This series will be comprised of a base game, 16Pz, with the rules, charts, markers, dice, etc that enable play of the other modules.  The other modules will include 29PzGr, 16Pz Expansion, and Herman Goering/15PzGr.  Each of these will focus on about a divisions worth of Germans and Allies and include the maps and unit counters specific to those elements.  The entire beachhead will be covered when the entire series is complete.<br/><br/>The total game package will have the equivalent of 7 and a half 22 x 34 map sheets.  Most modules will have just (2) 22 x 34 maps.  Each module will have a number of scenarios that allow for smaller table space and game play duration.<br/><br/>The system has some enhancements with unit counters, such as the use of silouhettes for tanks and color coding of the different organizations for ease of tracing command and control.  The rules are well written and efficient.  They are clear and easy to read.  They are organized in a manner that aides learning.  They are structured along the 7 Battlefield Operating Systems which are Command and Control, Maneuver, Fire Support, Combat Service Support, Intelligence, Mobility and Survivability, and Air Defense.  This provides a real world view of the rules as opposed to a gamers view of the rules, but will greatly ease the learning curve and put the rules into proper context.<br/><br/>The units are modeled as Platoons for the Germans and mostly Companies and some platoons for the Allies.  Units have Secondary and Primary weapons and may use these in conjunction with each other or separately against the same or different targets.<br/><br/>A key feature of the game system is the Operations Phase.  During this time most of the action occurs.  One player may perform movement, fire, overrun, go into reserve, or setup in overwatch, and do it in any order the player wants.  This allows for a free flow of action that more closely resembles combat and the execution of smaller parts of the overall plan.  The non-phasing player must keep a close eye on the enemy as they may use opportunity fire to slow or stop the movement they don't like.  They may also use reserves to bolster the defense.  Players will see that this gives them maximum flexibility and gives both players something to do at all times.<br/><br/>Both sides in this series of games will have some time on the attack and on the defense.  The Germans are defending at start and on the 13th Sept they change to the offensive as they try to force the Americans off the beach.

Here's a villager who just can't sleep at nighttime, try as he might. The good news is that in his hazy non-sleep time, he learns if one or both of his neighbors was up during the night doing something. He's not alert to know if it was indeed just one of them or both, and if only one of them which one it was, but he knows if someone was up and about during the night. Each night. It might be a werewolf out looking for prey. It might be the helpful Seer who is trying to find werewolves. Or it might be any other number of nighttime active roles in the game.<br/><br/>Much more alert at nighttime is the Beholder. She wakes up the first night and sees who the Seer is! What she ends up doing with that information is anyone's guess, but hopefully she'll figure out how to help the village and prevent the Seer from being lynched by the crazed mob.<br/><br/>And then there's everyone's favorite numerically-aware goth, The Count. He's got his spreadsheet open, and he's, well, counting all night. He knows how many werewolves are on each side of him in the village because he counted. &quot;One Werewolf. Two, two scary hairy werewolves...ah ha ha ha. Three, three three evil lycanthropic werewolves...mwa ha ha ha.&quot;<br/><br/>Possibly the most mysterious creature of the night is the Thing (that goes &quot;bump&quot; in the night). This nasty, furry, slightly smelly creature is helping out the village by bumping people in the wee hours of night. What will those people do with the information garnered from the Thing? What is the Thing's ultimate purpose?<br/><br/>But not everyone is out to help people at nighttime. There's a new werewolf in town, though she's a little...sleepy. The Dreamwolf takes it easy, not bothering to wake up with the other werewolves unless one of her sister werewolves is killed. Then she's all about taking out her revenge on the village. Watch out!<br/><br/>Finally, the most feared night monster of all, the Bogeyman, rounds out the roles in Night Terrors. Take too long at nighttime and the Bogeyman gets to kill someone.

It is named after the World Wrestling Federation annual pay-per-view event of the same name. No Mercy is the follow-up to 1999's WWF WrestleMania 2000. No Mercy was well-received by players and critics alike.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Some of the features included in WrestleMania 2000 were removed from No Mercy. First, wrestlers' entrances were cut short to showing the wrestler only appear on the stage/entrance ramp, and players never see wrestlers actually enter the ring (despite early screen shots showing full ring entrances). For example, Triple H is shown spitting water at the crowd upon entering the ring. The belt options were also changed; rather than creating a belt from scratch, players now have to complete a story mode to win a title. While this added an extra challenge to the game, fans felt that they had been robbed of a unique and well-liked option from WrestleMania 2000 (The Create-A-Belt option would return in WWE WrestleMania X8). However, the 'official' WWF belts that replaced user-created ones can still be wagered in Exhibition matches and pay-per-view events, even being used as the object in Ladder Matches. Additionally, there is noticeable slow down when four wrestlers are on the screen at once, something not present in WrestleMania 2000.<br/><br/>However, No Mercy features a much more extensive Create-a-Wrestler mode with more moves, more customizable body attributes, better-organized clothing options (No Mercy utilizes descriptive categories and titles for each clothing item, whereas WrestleMania 2000 simply numbers items), the ability to create female wrestlers, which is nearly impossible in WrestleMania 2000. Each wrestler in the game has four different ring attires that could be independently edited, and each attire can be completely changed including name, height and weight, body parts, and music, technically allowing four different wrestlers per slot; although, they must share a common moveset. Several of the game's unlockable wrestlers used this feature, such as Taka Michinoku who has his partner Funaki in two attire slots. The graphics also were improved significantly over the game's predecessor, and various match types made their debuts in Nintendo 64 wrestling games, including ladder matches and special referee matches. The game also marked the first time on the system in a WWF game that players could fight backstage and also the first time moves can be done on the announcer's table. Many parts of the backstage environment are usable, such as being able to hit the opponent with a pool stick and driving them through the pool table in the bar/lounge.<br/><br/>The story mode is more extensive, compared to WrestleMania's career mode. Each WWF title features a unique story. For the WWF Championship, players can choose any wrestler to reenact the classic feud between Mankind and Triple H that dominated the WWF in early to mid 2000. Other angles include Stone Cold Steve Austin's feud and The Rock's temporary alliance with Vince McMahon. After winning a title, the player can replay the story mode and defend the newly-acquired belt in a variety of new storylines. Also, unlike future wrestling games, players are allowed to fight for and defend any championship in the exhibition mode.<br/><br/>The story mode's depth is due in part to its branching storylines that develop based on the outcomes of the player's matches. In WrestleMania 2000, if the player lost a match in the career mode, the game only allowed the player to retry the match, rather than adjusting the storyline accordingly. No Mercy's story mode offers branching storylines based on the outcomes of matches. The player has to actually play through each story several times and lose matches in order to achieve a 100% completion rating.<br/><br/>Another notable feature that was added to the game is the &quot;SmackDown! Mall.&quot; With money earned from winning matches in story mode and playing the Survival mode, players can purchase unlockable characters, clothing, wrestling moves, props, tattoos, weapons, and venues.<br/><br/>Launch copies of No Mercy suffer from a bug that erases saved content, including created wrestlers, championship story modes, and game saves. The bug was corrected in later production runs.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Wwf no mercy&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "102759": {"poll": [], "name": "South Park", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Nintendo 64 edition", "North American PlayStation edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1043190.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon"], "videogamefranchise": ["South Park"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Iguana Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["First Person Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo 64", "PlayStation"], "usersrated": "12", "average": "4.625", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Acclaim Entertainment Inc."], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1043190_t.jpg", "description": "South Park is a first-person shooter video game based on the first few seasons of the popular TV series of the same name.

Combat is fast and furious and there (again depending on which of the many games you choose to play) are even supply issues to deal with while you shoot, bomb, and shell your adversaries.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "name": "TSWW: Balkan Fury", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "7.63", "usersrated": "10", "boardgamefamily": ["The Second World War Series"]}, "102774": {"rpgdesigner": ["Mark Gelinas"], "statistics": [], "name": "Tidewater Traveller Times (Volume 1, Issue 1 - Jun 1987)", "rpgartist": ["Mark Gelinas"], "rpgproducer": ["Mark Gelinas"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1038943.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "4", "rpgissue": ["Tidewater Traveller Times"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Campaign Report", "Geo News Service", "A Letter from the Editor", "Quick Reviews", "Tidewater Traveller Club", "Workshop News"], "rpg": ["2300 AD", "Traveller (Classic)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1038943_t.jpg", "description": "Emperor Strephon Assassinated<br/><br/>From the Credits:<br/><br/>The Tidewater Traveller TIMES is the official newsletter of the Tidewater Traveller Club.<br/><br/>Editor: Mark &quot;Mad Geo&quot; Gelinas<br/><br/>"}, "102775": {"poll": [], "name": "Bombers Over Europe", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1039221_t.jpg", "average": "5.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Earle Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1039221.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Aviation / Flight", "World War II"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "An old war game made during or after World War II.

This can be a good excuse to do diorama bases for your leaders if you are so inclined.<br/><br/>Clash of Empires even has a use for those casualty figures you never painted!<br/><br/>THE RULEBOOK<br/><br/>In the rulebook will be lists for the Early Imperial Romans and its enemies in the west &ndash; Ancient Germans, Ancient British, Caledonians and Dacians.<br/><br/>The first army list book will cover Early Achaemenid Persia to the death of Alexander.<br/><br/>Many army lists will be free to download from the web. They will be official but will be living lists reviewed by us and the wargaming community.  Some of these will go to print but many will stay on the website as free downloads.<br/><br/>The rulebook also contains rules for four different scenarios including elements such as terrain placement, terrain types, army initiative and flanking manoeuvres.<br/><br/>"}, "102783": {"poll": [], "name": "Sure Shot Basketball", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1970", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Basketball", "Sure Shot"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1170687_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ideal"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1170687.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Ideal Edition 1970"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Sports"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The object of Sure Shot Basketball game is to be the player to score 15 Baskets.

In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.<br/><br/>It's up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm. In the end, the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins.<br/><br/>You can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different furnishing tiles for your cave.<br/><br/>Caverna: The Cave Farmers, which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player, is a complete redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources. Designer Uwe Rosenberg says that the game includes parts of Agricola, but also has new ideas, especially the cave part of your game board, where you can build mines and search for rubies.

Everything's available from level 1, and it only gets better.<br/><br/>Then delve into our rich and easy crafting system. Customize your razor-edged, chainsawing claymore or your electrified, steam-powered longrifle to your heart's content. And it doesn't stop at weapons - you can build an entire automaton, customizing its body, the way it thinks, the weapon's it uses, and how it functions, and, when you're done with that one, build another! And steampunk wouldn't be complete with airships, dirigibles, and locomotives. And, of course, you can build them all! Customize your train so that it has a deployable helium-filled envelope, is entirely amphibious, has magnetech cannons lining its side, and has a roaring engine that nobody can out pace. And that's just the beginning.<br/><br/>From our easy character creation system to our intuitive and high-movement combat rules to our enormous array of character abilities, Tephra will leave you building, creating, and dreaming until you can't take it anymore. This is steampunk - the options are unlimited.<br/><br/>"}, "102797": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1084884.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Eric M.

(a label of U.S. Gold) in 1987. It was produced by Probe Software (the team consisted of David Quinn, Nick Bruty and David Perry). It was released in Spain (as &quot;Trantor&quot;) by Erbe Software. The game is a mix between shoot 'em up and a platform game, but it was mostly known for its large and well-animated sprites.<br/><br/>The player controls the titular stormtrooper who is the only survivor of the destruction of his spaceship (hence the title). Gameplay revolves around exploring the play-area and collecting code-letters. The play-area consists of several different floors which can be explored freely via connecting lifts. However, Trantor is up against a very strict time limit.<br/><br/>The levels are infested by various aliens and small flying robots which sap Trantor's strength if he touches them. Fortunately, Trantor is armed with a flamethrower with which to destroy these pests. Unfortunately, fuel for this is limited although he can re-fill this at fuel-points located on many of the floors. Whenever Trantor finds a code-letter, his timer countdown is reset and then counts down again until he finds another letter. For this reason, much of the gameplay is a race-against-time. There are also lockers scattered around the floors which contain pick-ups to assist Trantor. These include hamburgers (restore strength) and clocks (reseting the time, as finding a code letter would). The game ends when Trantor's energy runs out or if the timer reaches zero.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trantor' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trantor</a>:_The_Last_Stormtrooper,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "102912": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Tom Razo"], "poll": [], "name": "Crossbones: The Swashbuckling Pirate Adventure Game", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1730200_t.jpg", "average": "6.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unpublished)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1730200.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Dice", "Exploration", "Nautical", "Pirates", "Racing"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "A pirate's life adventure tale...<br/><br/>Crossbones: The Swashbuckling Pirate Adventure Game is designed for 2-5 players, ages 10 to adult, with a play time of approximately 30 to 45 minutes.<br/><br/>Introduction<br/><br/>Avast, me hearties!

A sound novel is similar to a visual novel in that the gameplay requires relatively little player interaction as most of the game is composed of text dialogues. The original release contained no voice acting for the characters. While a visual novel's basis would be the visual aspect, as the name suggests, a sound novel's basis takes more care in producing an atmosphere via the music, sound effects, and the story itself.<br/><br/>Higurashi no Naku Koro ni takes place during June 1983, at a fictional rural village called Hinamizawa, which has a population of approximately 2,000. The main character, Keiichi Maebara, moves to Hinamizawa and befriends his new classmates Rena Ryugu, Mion Sonozaki, Rika Furude, and Satoko Houjou. Keiichi joins their after-school club activities, which consist mostly of card and board games (and punishment games for the loser, usually him.) Hinamizawa appears to be a normal, peaceful, rural village to Keiichi. However, the tranquility abruptly ends after the annual Watanagashi Festival, a celebration to commemorate and give thanks to the local god, Oyashiro. Keiichi learns that every year for the past four years, one person has been murdered and another has gone missing on the day of the Watanagashi Festival. Keiichi himself soon becomes drawn into the strange events surrounding the Watanagashi Festival and Oyashiro. In each story arc, he or one of his friends become paranoid, and a crime is committed. Usually, the crime involves the murder of one of their own friends. While it seems impossible to tell their delusions apart from the mystery of Hinamizawa, slowly the truth is revealed.<br/><br/>While the first four games in the Higurashi no Naku Koro ni series are known as question arcs, the games form Kai are known as the answer arcs. The last four games released in the series, were, in contrast to the question arcs, meant to answer all of the questions presented in the first half of the series. These arcs can be considered the &quot;solutions&quot; of the previous arcs. Each answer arc game contains all of the previous answer arcs.<br/><br/>Chapter 3: Minagoroshi-hen (&quot;Massacre Chapter&quot;)<br/>On the surface, Minagoroshi-hen is the solution to Tatarigoroshi-hen; however, it answers most of the major common mysteries of the previous arcs. It is told from the perspective of Rika Furude. Most notably, the true identity of the murderer is finally revealed in Minagoroshi-hen. After Minagoroshi-hen, one more effort is needed to seal the story into a happy ending.<br/><br/>"}, "102935": {"poll": [], "name": "Buffalo in-a-box", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Set Collection", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["... in a Box", "Cities: Buffalo (New York, USA)", "Monopoly"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1948199_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Late for the Sky Production Company"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1948199.png", "boardgameversion": ["Late for the Sky Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Negotiation"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This is a version of Monopoly that features landmarks of Buffalo, NY.<br/><br/>From the box: Buy property, build a skyline, trade the skyline for a key to the city.

The Lycanth came to build a sophisticated civilization and an orderly society. They developed their own unique physique, with high physical strength and a strong spirit. However, technology appeared for which the civilization was not ready. A large number of Lycanth were slaughtered by this forbidden technology. While mass-slaughter had not been the intent, it nevertheless caused the nation to descend into civil war, in a conflict eventually called the &quot;Beast War&quot;. With the Lycanth having lost the greater bulk of their population, the leaders transferred the right to rule the continent to the Humans (hito), which was then a small and weak race. As disorder continued to plague the diminishing Lycanth population, the Humans reconstructed the nation and returned the land to prosperity.<br/><br/>The Humans came to think of the Lycanth as the &quot;race which ruined the world&quot;, and made their intent to mass-exterminate the Lycanth known. While Lycanth are normally Human-like, the Humans came to believe that the Lycanth were dangerous in their beast-forms due to their lack of ability to think. Under the order of the king, the church began to exterminate the Lycanth under acts of heresy. The knights were armed in preparation for any invasions or uprising by foreign nations and the Lycanth alike. A Lycanth extermination movement, called the &quot;Lycanth Hunt&quot;, was launched and encouraged the population to turn in Lycanth for rewards.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_the_Tempest,&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_the_Tempest,&quot</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "102946": {"poll": [], "name": "Tales of Innocence", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Nintendo DS edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "videogamefranchise": ["Tales of"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Alfa System"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo DS"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Namco Bandai Games Inc."], "description": "The Imperial Capital of Regnum kept itself in peace during the long-lasting world war.

The player can control the tilt of the ship, making flying upside down, simple and can fly in any direction. There is a target locking system that help the player find enemies quickly, as well as shows which enemies are closer by a number at the targets side. Besides lasers both ships also have their own type of torpedo. An energy shield can be turned on and off when needed, to save energy. And a circular radar display appears at the bottom of the screen, which also tilts as the ship does allowing you to tell it your above an enemy. And a next target arrow showing you which direction the nearest enemy is.<br/><br/>There are two main type of enemies, fighters and Carrier ships, both types of ships must be destroyed before the current mission is complete. The buttons used to shoot and speed up, and such can be changed on the options menu of the game before beginning. There are Easy and Hard settings, and an object viewer option to get a closer look at what enemies you will have to face, you can zoom in and out as well as tilt and rotate the ship in any direction. A sound test allows the player to listen to the music or sound effects, and another on off option can be used to turn the game's music and sound effects on and off before playing. The player can also change the speed control of their ship so it will go back to a standard speed if not pressing a button, or stay at one speed until you press the break or thrust. Players can also change the color of their ships and the enemies. If using the six-button controller the mode button can be used to enter &quot;Chase&quot; view which is seeing the fighter from behind rather than the cockpit. If the player chooses the second fighter they will have the option of choosing auto-pilot, which allows the computer to fly and the player to concentrate on fighting. In two player mode player one can control the gunner and the second can control the pilot. There are six missions, and before each a tactical display will show the players ship and where the enemy, and any other targets, or obstacles. There are two additional options that appear on the title screen after playing, the first is a &quot;Trace&quot; mode that allows the player to view a record of the last mission of their last game played, as if it were filmed and pieces of film where pieced together, with zoom ins tilts and following camera angles. The second option that appears is a score option that lets you[who?] see how well you did, but this is only viewable after you've beaten the game once, the title screen will eventually reappear and this option will be added to it.<br/><br/>There is very little story in the game itself, only mission objectives, mostly the story comes from the instructions and the box.<br/><br/>&quot;Scramble Fighters!

Why am I telling you this? Wake up, cadet! Where is Outpost 51? And where are we? Get it?

Technos would later produce its own fighting game based on the Double Dragon movie the following year simply titled Double Dragon for the Neo Geo.
