Each player has a group of six pirates, and you want to be the first to have all six escape through the tortuous underground passage that connects the fortress to the port, where a sloop is waiting for them.<br/><br/>To move a pirate, you need to play a card from your hand. Each card bears one of six symbols (gun, rum, parrot, etc.), and when you play a card, you move one of your pirates forward to the next matching symbol in the tunnel, leapfrogging over matching symbols where another pirate already stands. The only way to get more cards, however, is to move backwards; more specifically, you move one of your pirates backwards to the first space that holds one or two pirates, drawing one or two cards after doing so. Each turn, you take 1-3 actions, whether moving forward or backward or both. When you move a pirate to the end of the track, it jumps on the sloop where it must await the other pirates in its crew. With every step toward victory, though, you have fewer and fewer pirates to move each turn, possibly locking you in to actions you don't want, so be sure to plan ahead and not leave yourself empty-handed!<br/><br/>This version of Cartagena includes the classic base game mixed with Cartagena 2. The Pirate's Nest and several new variants. The game includes eight double-sided game boards, and to play the base game you use only six of them. Use more boards for a longer game, or fewer boards (and possibly fewer pirates) for a shorter game. To replicate Cartagena 2, you can flip over three or more of the game boards to create a secondary path that's separate from the first one. Now when you place pirates in the sloop, you can use an action to move the sloop to the start of the second path &mdash; and with two paths, you have a harder time making huge jumps from start to finish.<br/><br/>&quot;Morgan&quot; is a variant in which players can now draw cards by moving an opponent's pirate ahead, drawing one or two cards when the pirate stops at the first space that contains one or two pirates; this variant and all others can be used in any version of the game. With the &quot;Filibusters&quot; variant, whenever someone plays one of the twelve cards with a dark background, everyone other than the active player must discard until they have at most seven cards in hand.<br/><br/>Finally, the &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot; variant introduces special powers to the six symbols on the card, and when you play a card, you can use it for pirate movement like normal or use the card' power. You can play two parrots as if they were any other symbol, or use a lantern to look at the top four cards and keep one of your choice. With the gun, you steal a card of your choice from an opponent's hand, with them getting one free draw in return. The treasure chest symbol lets you pick up the treasure chest from the space where you stand, most likely drawing cards from the deck as a bonus, but possibly suffering a snakebite that will have you running back for rum to help you forget the pain!<br/><br/>"}, "224032": {"rpgdesigner": ["Sean Nokes", "Walt Robillard"], "rpg": ["ICONS"], "poll": [], "name": "Torc of the Blood Kings (ICONS)", "rpgartist": ["Ade Smith"], "rpgproducer": ["Mike Lafferty", "Ade Smith"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3480658.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Fainting Goat Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Improbable Tales"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3480658_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>A treasure hunter has uncovered a powerful, arcane artifact that was best left buried!

Lee, in overall command of the southern army in the area, had no intention of sitting passively. He aggressively sent Longstreet's wing to unite with Jackson, hoping to disrupt the US forces and commit to battle on favorable terms, even though the northerners had superior numbers. A number of battles were fought during this campaign, including the major battle of Second Bull Run.<br/><br/>More Aggressive Attitudes is an operational-level game for two players exploring the 1862 Virginia Campaign. Each hex represents a span of five miles, and each turn is a day. The counter density is low - just a handful of units per side - and the rules are simple, but nuanced. The focus is squarely on the operational level, and the ability of your subordinates to carry out your orders - to march a given distance in a day, to avoid battle, or to coordinate their attacks - is not entirely within your control. This uncertainty is simulated by a series of die rolls. (Don't worry about &quot;wristage&quot;; in practice, it's only a few rolls per turn.)<br/><br/>A number of chromey bits effortlessly recreate the particulars of this campaign without ever getting in the way of your decision-making and agency. The result is a compelling operational sandbox for gamers both old and new.<br/><br/>"}, "224042": {"rpgdesigner": ["Sherman Sanders"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Min-Max Monsters", "rpgartist": ["Sherman Sanders", "Shutterstock.com"], "rpgproducer": ["Austin Doty"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3480655.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3480655_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Want to spice up your encounters?

They are ready to become tempting dreams and lurking nightmares anywhere, in any campaign that wants something more from drow than what you&rsquo;ve seen before.<br/><br/>Each chapter in the drow of Porphyra focuses on one of the tribes, providing all of the following:<br/><br/>A brief history of the tribe on their home world and in recent nights<br/>The hierarchies and divisions of their society, from nobles to guilds and beyond<br/>Laws and punishments particular to the culture<br/>Religious expectations, whether they follow one god or many or none<br/>Goals for characters within their families, groups, cities, and nations<br/>Notable cities and plot hooks for interacting with the tribe, from within or without<br/>Methods common to their kind, whether they rely on raids or seduction or other guises<br/>Racial and faction traits to help customize your characters from the base on up<br/>Alternate systems and mechanics necessary for the tribe (and for evil or other campaigns)<br/>Feats and equipment that are useful to have at hand<br/>Details for creating player characters, allies, antagonists, and others with new depths<br/>You never know what the next chapter will reveal, but together, the drow of Porphyra cover a powerful range of roleplaying experiences. Add one or all of them to your game now!<br/><br/>This volume follows the tale of the Strivog, who fled a dying world only to emerge on Porphyra infused with death in a whole new way. Having claimed magically glowing ice caverns in a remote corner of the Underdeep, they continue to build their empire with the corpses of their enemies and any other bodies they can claim. They take slaves, but also attract zealous vassals who serve until their last breaths of their own free will. They torture and torment, but maintain a cold distance and a brutal, simple efficiency. They destroy lives, but are dedicated to building objects that will outlast them. Because for the bone brow, death is the truth and the only reality worth preparing for.<br/><br/>Highlights of this chapter include:<br/><br/>A unique system for character options and advancement<br/>Changes to Craft, Profession, and Perform categories<br/>Rules for building items that are imbued with the strengths of fallen foes<br/>A selection of Necromancy spells that showcase how the Strivog operate<br/><br/>"}, "224070": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Light OSR"], "statistics": [], "name": "Light OSR Core", "rpgdesigner": ["Efranor", "Ordoalea"], "rpgproducer": ["Filip Lon\u010dar"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3481395.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version 1.1"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3481395_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>Light OSR Core is a rules-light, two-page roleplaying game that emulates the &quot;old school&quot; dungeon delving experience with a minimal rule set.

It draws from history and myth, providing a setting equal parts familiar and surreal. The Northern Realm affords many tools for the storytelling experience, which you can participate in as the player or the story master. Within this book there are many story hooks and mysteries, including the first chapter of a campaign at the end. There are also folktales, artifacts, ruins, magical creatures, gods, and, of course, heroes that can spin many stories unto themselves.<br/><br/>The continent of Rhen dominates the setting. Within it players can explore. It is a rich universe that can influence you, as much as you can it. Every game has players and a Story Master (SM). The Story Master is equal parts author, narrator, and god. The SM designs the story based on elements in this book and then describes events as they happen in the game world, playing the characters within and deciding how the players&rsquo; decisions affect the world. The players in turn, explore the setting the SM has created, taking turns interacting with their environment and describing what they do.<br/><br/>The Northern Realm is intended to be a shared story as much as a multiplayer game. Control of what happens around you by way of environmental effects, non-playable characters (NPCs), and events lands squarely in the hands of the SM, but how you influence the events around you is bounded only by your imagination. It is the SM&rsquo;s job to choose a place within The Northern Realm and use the information available to him/her to build a rich environment. We have provided a plethora of resources in this book to make sure that detailed descriptions of histories, geography, cultures, magic, monsters, organizations, even fables are available for use.<br/><br/>"}, "224099": {"rpgdesigner": ["Robert Miller", "Kirk W.

In addition to controlling a hero, the player has spells at his disposal with which he can alter the very structure of the castle.<br/>In a Magus turn, a player can perform up to 2 normal actions (move, attack, play spells, among others) and any number of quick actions (use knowledge, advance missions, use relics, etc.) Each action has a cost that must be paid whit energy from one of the two existing wells: Well of power (Green) and Well of control (purple). As the game progresses players will gain energy that they can freely assign to their power or control reserve as needed for one or the other action.<br/>The Magus main mode of play is competitive, each player will try to reach before the rest to the 10 dominion points using his hero and his spells to delay the advance of his enemies. But there is also the cooperative mode, here players must defeat the powerful archmage Ardeth. For this they must travel the castle fulfilling different objectives that reduce the dominion of the archmage before this one arrives at the castle for the final combat.<br/>In cooperative mode, Dominion points are a measure to Ardeth's strength, and players must reduce it as much as possible as they prepare for their arrival. When the archmage appears in the castle they must face it, and the life of Ardeth will be determined by the dominion accumulated at the moment of its appearance.<br/><br/><br/>Magus: Aura Mortis es una reimplementaci&oacute;n de Magus: &quot;Fortuna et nostis&quot;.

Maybe they were killing the mood at a party, ruining a great punchline, layering red tape onto a business, or just plain old-fashioned sucking the blood from the living. Contrary to myth they do much of this in broad daylight, their only fear of the sun being that it might expose them to mockery. They drain humor from the world because they fear someone might dare to laugh at them. You know the type.<br/><br/>Vampires are right to be afraid, as their immortality depends on their dignity. Clowns must destroy a Vampire in a hilarious way for it to stick. This war has gone on for ages, and unfortunately the old &ldquo;Gags&rdquo; like garlic and crosses barely get a chuckle nowadays. Sure, folks thought being impaled on a stake with a brick in your mouth was the acme of comedy once, but today's Clown plays for a tough crowd. Fortunately, Vampires fall into the &ldquo;Straight man&rdquo; role so eagerly that it isn't impossible to set up a killer Gag.<br/><br/>...and do it you must, or the world will be drained of everything that makes it worth living.

The table is free for all meaning anyone can start a new triangle, continue an existing triangle, or complete a triangle by playing the final missing piece. Multiple triangles can be in the making simultaneously and whoever completes a triangle scores its cards.<br/><br/>TRIANGLE TRICKS: A trick-taking game with a twist where the highest number (1-3, joker) takes the trick. In the event that two players are tied the same trick continues and all players - even those who played a low card - are still in the game.

The game's system is balanced enough for anyone to jump in. At the same time, its deep enough to offer, nearly, infinite potential for strategy. In Bio-Logic, resources are limited and foes are many, so you must adapt and evolve or you will certainly fade away.<br/><br/>Unique Character Development<br/><br/>All players begin with a choice of initial stat bonus and 1 of 6 special inherent traits. These traits can grant special boosts and bonus rewards, manipulate player or enemy stats, or protect oneself from the reactive world placement. Every &quot;Bug&quot; has its own advantage and strategy, and it's up to you to put that to maximum use. In addition, players can evolve new abilities based on specific board tiles.<br/><br/>Combat/Infecting....Vs. World, Vs. Players<br/><br/>Developing ones &quot;Bug&quot;, involves infecting the world around you for stat boosting rewards. Some tiles are infected instantly. However, greater rewards are reserved for those who attempt to infect the vital organs, or enemy tiles, through combat. There are 3 levels of tiles for a player to choose from as they grow. Each tier offers greater obstacles but with greater rewards for the victor.<br/><br/>Players also have the option of combating one another to steal resources and abilities. Some &quot;bugs&quot; are better made for this than others. You can use this feature to sabotage the lead players advance, steal your favorite choice abilities, or monopolize tile type. Bio-Logic is all about choice and strategy, but you must push forward at all costs, for hesitation will bring only certain defeat.<br/><br/>Tile-Placement/World Manipulation<br/><br/>While building your character and fighting for resources, the human you infect is also attempting to eradicate you. Special enemy tiles have the ability to instantly alter many in-game stats. But it's not totally out of your control, you have a choice in how you reveal the board. The way you place tiles plays a big role in how the game progresses. Some enemies have effects that can activate as soon as the tile is put into play, while others wait until they are infected to cause a reaction. Not only does your development need attention, but so does the evolving world in which you live. Bio-Logic is always changing and you must learn to adapt if you are to survive.<br/><br/>Final Words<br/><br/>Bio-Logic takes you into an environment unlike any other. With 3 random draw piles, choice tile placement, special abilities, and limited resources no game is ever the same. On any given turn you must make decisions that affect the entire game world, altering everyone's future. It's a delicate dance where you must evaluate every aspect of development to ultimately claim victory over your friends. In Bio-logic, you must master your universe or get wiped from existence.<br/><br/>"}, "224220": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3488427.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Rob Seater"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2017", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Sam Gon III"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "maxplaytime": "40", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3488427_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Animals", "Prehistoric", "Print & Play"], "description": "Description from the designer:<br/><br/>Trilobites are among the most successful animals to ever live on Earth, lasting for over 250 million years and spanning the globe.  They mostly lived on the sea floor in shallow oceans, but some varieties lived in deeper water and on land in tidal regions.  They were highly diversified in physiology, habitat, and behavior &ndash; ranging from inches to feet in length,  some foraging, some hunting, some filter feeding, and some grazing.  Their closest living relative is the Horseshoe Crab, but all true trilobites went extinct by the end of the Permian.<br/><br/>Trilobite Dice recreates competition between different strains of trilobites as they populate the ocean shallows.  It is a cross between connection games (like Hex, Twixt, or Gonnect) and tactical dice games (like Roll Through the Ages, Octo Dice, or Pandemic: The Cure). It can be played competitively with 2 players or solo against an automated &lsquo;imposter&rsquo;.  Trilobite Dice is a print-and-play game, using consumable sheets of paper each game.<br/><br/>Players take turns rolling and rerolling special dice. The results of the dice provide resources to be allocate towards various special effects, including once-per-game bonus effects, ongoing special powers, and additional dice to roll on future turns. The players use these effects and powers to populate a hex map with their species, aiming to connect two opposite sides of the board before their opponent does so.  Some effects, such as buying extra dice, increase a player&rsquo;s hunger rating, which must be overcome before the player can win, so players must balance multiple objectives. The primary form of interaction between players is on the hex board, but some special powers create additional forms of interaction and alternate win conditions.  The game can be played in basic form, with just 20 special effects available, or advanced form with over 50 special effects to choose from (including more complex powers that combine to support additional tricks and strategies).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Print-and-play first edition"], "age": "12", "name": "Trilobite Dice", "playingtime": "40", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Pattern Building"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Connection Games"]}, "224221": {"rpgartist": ["Martin McKenna", "Russ Nicholson", "Brett Schofield"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Warlock of Firetop Mountain", "rpgdesigner": ["Brett Schofield"], "rpgproducer": ["Graham Bottley"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3484145.png", "usersrated": "3", "rpgsetting": ["Titan"], "average": "7.33333", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Advanced Fighting Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Arion Games", "Cubicle 7 Entertainment"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3484145_t.png", "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>Deep below Firetop Mountain is a dungeon.

The left and right edges of the board are colored white; the top and bottom edges are colored black.<br/><br/>DEFINITIONS<br/>A piece is a single stone or two stacked stones in a single space.<br/>A weak pair is a set of two like-colored, diagonally adjacent pieces such that there is no like-colored piece orthogonally adjacent to both.<br/>The rank of a weak pair is the number of stones in that weak pair. This value can range from 2 to 4.<br/>A crosscut is a 2x2 set of pieces consisting of two diagonally adjacent black pieces and two diagonally adjacent white pieces.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE<br/>The goal of Consta is to form a connected chain of your pieces linking the opposite edges of the board marked by your color. I.e. White should connect the Left and Right edges and Black should connect the Top and Bottom edges. A corner is considered to be part of both adjoining edges.<br/><br/>You win when you have a connected chain at the end of the opponent&rsquo;s turn.<br/><br/>Two pieces are considered to be connected to each other if they are:<br/>- orthogonally adjacent or<br/>- diagonally adjacent and: the weak pair doesn't belong to a crosscut or the weak pair is the highest rank weak pair that belongs to a crosscut.<br/><br/>No draws are possible in Consta.<br/><br/>PLAY<br/>The game begins with an empty board. Each player has an allocated color: Black or White. Black plays first, then turns alternate.<br/><br/>Black plays first, placing one black stone on one space.

Each time the vacuum cleaner comes out you strive to be recognised as the most daring of all Dustbunnies by risking the dangers of the vortex.<br/><br/>Each round your fate is secretly linked with one of six fluffballs. The closer you can get your fluffball to the vacuum without it being sucked-up the more daring you will seem when the fates are revealed after the contest.<br/> Use your innate control of static, charms you found down the back of the sofa and your unique character powers to collectively propel the balls of fluff across the carpet. The furniture, rugs and even pets you encounter will help and hinder your efforts.<br/> Keep which colour of fluffball fate has handed you a secret, while working out which one your opponents are linked to and then decide which to send up the tube. Choose correctly and your opponent will be the agonised loser while you will rise to fame and glory in the kingdom behind the skirting boards.<br/><br/>Daring Dustbunnies is a game for 2 to 6 players and includes a solo variant. Each game lasts between 20 and 30 minutes and is suitable for ages 8 and up.<br/><br/>This is a card driven race game with a difference. The aim of the game is to attempt to move the fluffball you are secretly supporting to the highest scoring position (closest to the vacuum) when each round ends without being sucked-up.<br/> You start the game with 4 randomly dealt cards, each showing one of the six fluffballs and a &quot;suction&quot; number for how far it moves. On your turn you play one card to move a fluffball towards the doom that is the vacuum cleaner. Each carpet tile has a special power and if you move a fluffball onto an empty tile you immediately perform the carpet action. Moving onto an occupied space will reward you with static, the currency in the game which powers the charms. Exhausting your hand of cards will earn you a victory point and four new cards.<br/><br/>Keeping which ball of fluff you are linked to a secret is key if you want it to stay out of the vacuum. <br/>Being closest to the vacuum of doom will get you big points but being inside it loses you everything.<br/>Use timing, tactics and trickery to prove you are the smartest and bravest of all the Daring Dustbunnies.<br/><br/>"}, "224290": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Cuil", "rpgdesigner": ["Paul Appleby"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3485261.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Cuil"], "rpgpublisher": ["Chromagination Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3485261_t.jpg", "description": "An Experiment in Surreal Role-Playing<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/><br/>CUIL is an abstract and experimental role-playing game where things, in general, proceed as expected right up until they don&rsquo;t.

On your first day, you have been assigned to patrol a distant cave alongside other new recruits - It was supposed to be an easy mission. Alas , the moment your patrol enters the cave, the very entrance collapses in on itself, trapping everyone within.<br/><br/>Suddenly, you hear someone cry out and everyone turns to look at a dead recruit. The enemy has infiltrated your ranks! Before he kills the entire patrol, you must somehow stop him. To make matters worse, you do not know what powers these other new faces possess. Attacking someone without fully understanding their powers could very well get you killed instead.<br/><br/>Welcome to The Pretenders.<br/><br/>How to Play<br/><br/>The Super Villains win if they kill enough recruits in the patrol. The Super Heroes wins if they manage to kill the infiltrator(s). It is also possible for everyone to die together from lack of food or oxygen within the cave and no one wins!<br/><br/>Each player begins the game with a hand of 9 cards, 5 of which are their own unique range of powers, and 4 of which are common cards (2 Backstabs, 1 Dodge/Push &amp; 1 Search). At the start of every day (turn), reveal the top card from the Event deck and resolve it. This can lead to things like the players finding extra food in the cave, or the system pushing the game to progress by forcing a player to reveal his powers. Whatever the event does, players have a very short minute to discuss quickly among themselves who the enemy is. At the end of the discussion, each player plays a card from his hand into an opaque bag. They must indicate the target of that card that they play, by using a unique Card Flip System where a Targeting Card is turned to a side matching the target's ID and putting that card into a Targeting Envelope (which is also put into the opaque bag). Note that players CAN target themselves. All players who are done will throw their draw bag into the middle of the play area. All the bags get shuffled thoroughly so that no one knows the original owners of the bags. The players then take 1 draw bag each and resolve the contents within. Example: Player 1 opens a draw bag that shows an 'Ice Lance' card along with a target 'C'. He then puts the Ice Lance card onto player C's character.<br/><br/>There are defensive cards as well, such as Dodge/Push or powers like 'Rime Armor'. If a player was the target of an attack, but has at least 1 such defense card played onto him as well, he will not die. Even if that player was the target of 5 attacks, just 1 defense card played on his character will negate all attacks. Cards played are removed from the game - This means abilities are limited in usage! When all draw bags are resolved, the day has ended and 1 oxygen is removed from the Air Track. All players also reduce 1 Food from their personal Food Tracks. The game continues until either the enemies have killed enough members from the patrol, or all the enemies have been killed. If the air runs out before a victory condition is met, all players lose the game.<br/><br/>Players who have been eliminated during the game do not just sit out and watch. They take on the roles of rescuers who are trying to dig the entrance out, and every day they try to throw something into the cave through a small hole in hopes of extending the victims' survivability. This is symbolized by them drawing the top 3 cards of the Event deck at the start of every new day, choosing which 1 to resolve and removing the other 2. Depending on whether they are an enemy or part of the patrol, they can influence the game quite heavily in this manner. Conflicts over which cards to resolve will be cast up for majority votes. In a tie of votes, the very first player who was eliminated gets to pick first.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "5", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "age": "10", "name": "The Pretenders", "playingtime": "35", "boardgamemechanic": ["Acting", "Action / Movement Programming", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Variable Player Powers"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Werewolf / Mafia"]}, "224357": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["A4 PDF Version 2.6", "US Letter PDF Version 2.6"], "statistics": [], "name": "To Stand Before the Dragon's Wrath", "rpgdesigner": ["Ed Turner"], "rpgproducer": ["Ed Turner"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3487711.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Thought Check Games"], "rpg": ["To Stand Before the Dragon's Wrath"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3487711_t.png", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>This is a game about people engaged in a battle to free their land from a tyrannical dragon.

German troops pour deep into Russia as you husband your forces to blunt the most dangerous attacks, giving up ground grudgingly as you pray for the early onset of Winter. Snow brings respite and fresh forces. But, the relief is short lived as the warm weather of 1942 brings new challenges. A rejuvenated German Army, a shadow of the initial invasion force, is still a force to be reckoned with! Unable to attack everywhere, the German will marshal his panzers and push where he feels success will bring decisive victory. Can you stop him!<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Russia Besieged is a multi-layered game experience that includes not only pushing counters on the map, players must also take into account their side&rsquo;s War Economy. The Russian player must deal with production of troops and oil to rebuild depleted forces while the German is on a constant struggle with replacement points to rebuild a proper mix of units to defeat the Red Horde!<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Can you do better than the historical counterparts?

As it went, the shooting star broke up, dropping fragments all across its path. Where these smaller pieces landed, dead men got up and rose from their graves, got up off the battle fields, and took arms against the living. To make matters worse, the newly dead&mdash;whether killed by the restless dead or more earthly causes&mdash;rose up to join the macabre host.<br/><br/>Life changed in Rome. Bodies were no longer buried or kept for viewing. They were cremated; their possessions given back to their families; their armor returned to the Legion. Plague followed in the poorer parts of the cities, leading to yet more uprisings of the newly dead. Rome eventually put down its local dead, but no sooner had it done so than a great rotting horde approached from beyond the lands of the Huns.<br/><br/>Still, life carried on, and Rome survived. After the death&mdash;some say assassination&mdash;of Emperor Tiberius, Caligula took control and began constructing massive defenses. Caligula&rsquo;s Wall is the greatest of these, meant to hold back the ever-present throng of dead moving against Rome from the east. <br/><br/>From the wine-dark Aegean to the sea north of the Goths, this line consists of a twin-line of fortification with a river in between. The Rhine in the north and the Gaius Flumen, a new river dug to extend the fortification to the Aegean, stretches to the south. Along these twin walls are milecastles, each numbered and spaced five miles apart, each serving as an entry into the Dead Wilds and a blockade against it. They also have a second purpose of acting as a lighthouse along the frontier, helping to keep it marked and spread warnings; each milecastle has buckets of powdered metals they can use to change the color of the flames and signal neighboring towers.<br/><br/>Last night, Milecastle 42, the next castle in the line, turned their signal fire red for danger. Minutes later, the fire was extinguished all together.

There are no Confederates closer than Corinth.&rdquo; - William Tecumseh Sherman to Jesse Appler of the 53rd Ohio, April 5<br/><br/>On April 5, 1862 the Confederacy appeared to be finished. Forts Henry and Donelson had fallen and a Confederate division had been routed at Mill Springs. The Rebels had lost Columbus, Clarksville, and Nashville. New Orleans and Memphis were under direct threat. Out west the invasion of New Mexico had failed and the Union had triumphed at Pea Ridge. Forts and ports along the seaboard were being captured or raided. In Virginia, George McClellan had at last started his great drive to capture Richmond. On the banks of the Tennessee River a complacent Union army rested and waited for reinforcements before beginning what some thought would be the final push to end the rebellion.<br/><br/>On the morning of April 6 the Confederates attacked that complacent army near Shiloh Church. For two days the biggest battle yet waged by Americans was fought, a battle as large and savage as anything fought by Napoleon. In the end the Union triumphed, but at heavy cost. Ulysses S. Grant was for a time sidelined and Union generals became cautious for months after. Most of all, Shiloh changed the Civil War. Combined with Robert E. Lee&rsquo;s successful defense of Richmond, Shiloh killed the vain dream of a quick war with conservative ends. The American Civil War became a long contest of wills, ending in the destruction of slavery and economic ruin for the American South.<br/><br/>Rally Round the Flag is a brigade grand tactical system that combines old school hex and counter maneuvers with rules for command and control, leader personalities, and a CRT that favors quality and firepower over raw mass. For Shiloh the series will feature rules for the 47th Tennessee, Lew Wallace&rsquo;s variable arrival, and Union gunboats among other things. The game comes with multiple scenarios, including a better Confederate attack plan, the battle starting on April 5, and the second day of battle. In addition, rules are included to modify each scenario with a variable arrival for Don Carlos Buell&rsquo;s Army of the Ohio and part of the Fort Donelson garrison escaping and taking part in the battle. For those wanted to be even more adventurous, units are included from Earl Van Dorn&rsquo;s Army of the West, and the brigades involved in the siege of Island No. 10.<br/><br/>"}, "224443": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jason Miceli"], "average": "10", "poll": [], "name": "Trick Legacy", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Partnerships", "Trick-taking"], "yearpublished": "2017", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3493767_t.png", "boardgameartist": ["Alisha Volkman"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["The Game Crafter, LLC", "Geek Fever Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3493767.png", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Fantasy"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Trick Legacy takes you on a journey through traditional trick-taking games, by altering core mechanics and individual player abilities from one game to the next.

By making the very acts of passing through a forest, setting up camp, building a shelter, making a fire, gathering food, and finding water an adventure, the DM can transform even the simplest journey into a grand adventure.<br/><br/>This book will provide some creative options to keep what is often the least interesting part of the game &ndash; getting from point A to point B &ndash; interesting and memorable. These will include the use of more evocative descriptors for rations such as salted pork, dried mushrooms, and hardtack instead of rations. It could include finding potable water, building a shelter against the coming rain, or caring for mounts. Additionally, the book will cover a variety of threats from hungry predators to hypothermia to venomous insects. There can also be natural solutions to these threats, such as, herbal remedies, pest repellents, and securing a campsite.<br/><br/>Also included in this books is a new character background, new equipment, 200 random events, and a new character sheet specifically designed for Cinematic Environs!<br/><br/>"}, "224477": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["RTF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "My Overcrowded Pineal Gland", "rpgdesigner": ["Gareth Hanrahan"], "rpgproducer": ["Nick Huggins"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3489398.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Horror (Cthulhu Mythos)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3489398_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>Following the collapse of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in the early 1900s, several splinter occult groups formed in London.

Normally, the influence of the Kami is restricted to the bonuses each of them grant during the Kami turn, granted to the Clan who has the most Shinto worshiping them. With Kami Unbound, the Kami will get their own figure, which starts the game in a specific Province.<br/><br/>While no Clan worships that Kami, the figure just stands there, watching over the mortals' actions. However, as soon as one of the Clans sends one of their Shinto to worship that Kami, they take its Kami power card (an all new component), placing it next to their Clan Screen to mark that they have the favor of that god. While you have the favor of a Kami, its figure basically counts as one of your figures. It can be moved when you Marshal and counts as 1 Force to your Clan when deciding Harvests and Battles. Also, being the powerful forces they are, Kami can never be Taken Hostage, targeted with Betrayal, or even killed!<br/><br/>More than that, the Kami card lists a special power the player can choose to activate.
