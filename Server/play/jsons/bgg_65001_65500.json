The advice is independent of a particular system or setting. Advice is given on group handling, preparation, and execution of an adventure. Also, there is a thorough guide to building an entertaining story for the particular group. The book is inspired by knowledge from The Forge and incorporates tips from indie games.<br/><br/>From the back of the German book:<br/><br/>Spielleiter. Keine andere Funktion in einer Rollenspiel-Runde ist so unbeliebt. Die damit verbundene Arbeit bleibt oft nur an einer einzigen Person aus einer Spielrunde h&auml;ngen. Dabei ist die Aufgabe mindestens ebenso spannend und &uuml;berraschend wie das &Uuml;bernehmen einer Spielfigur.<br/><br/>Beim Vergleich von Spielleitern f&auml;llt auf, dass Einige die Aufgabe besser erf&uuml;llen als Andere - das Ger&uuml;cht, dass man zum Leiten geboren sein muss, h&auml;lt sich daher hartn&auml;ckig. Dieses Buch will damit aufr&auml;umen und gibt Anf&auml;ngern und fortgeschrittenen Spielleitern eine Anleitung, die in Regelwerken von Rollenspielen leider meist zu kurz kommt: Welche Aufgaben hat ein Spielleiter &uuml;berhaupt? Wie bereitet man sich vor? Kann man Improvisieren lernen?<br/><br/>Zu diesen und anderen Fragen werden detaillierte Antworten und Anleitungen gegeben. Dabei steht immer das Spielvergn&uuml;gen im Vordergrund: Rollenspiel soll Spa&szlig; machen und nicht in Arbeit ausarten.<br/>Auch f&uuml;r den Spielleiter.<br/><br/>from the back of the English book<br/><br/>Gamemastering. No other task is as unpopular in a roleplaying group. Very often, it is the gamemaster who ends up doing all the work so everyone can enjoy the game. But the job of gamemaster is at least as exciting and unpredictable as taking on the role of a player character.<br/><br/>When comparing gamemasters, it becomes obvious that some are better at their task than others - which is why rumors that one has to be &quot;born to be a gamemaster&quot; stubbornly persist. This book does away with this preconception and provides both beginning and experienced gamemasters with instructions that are usually neglected in roleplaying game books. How to tailor the game to the group? How to prepare a game in no time? Can one learn to improvise? How to create and structure adventures?<br/><br/>These and other questions are answered in a detailed manner including directions, exercises, and examples. Enjoyment always comes first - roleplaying is supposed to be fun and not turn into too much work. <br/>Not even for the gamemaster.<br/><br/>"}, "65002": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jim Bambra", "George Barr", "Robert Bigelow", "Bruce Boston", "John C.

Kings rule over vast kingdoms, some shattered and torn by the Great War, other practically untouched since the beginning of time. A magic fog called the Voss fills the air, and those with the courage  and the will to master it can work great spells. Gods fight against their own kind in the heavens above for the right to control the races of the world, and a holy order of monks performs the gods' will on the earth below. Everywhere you look, men, elves, dwarves and cerenoth love, fight, pray, study and die alongside each other for their own codes and ambitions.

As with other adventure supplements in the DB series, The Conquered East does not cater to the standard display of &quot;Adventure by character level&quot;. Instead it offers descriptions of what is present within the shattered walls of East Dro Mandras, and leaves it for the adventurers to explore for good or ill, and for the CK to determine which encounters best suit the needs of their campaign group.<br/><br/>As with any Castles and Crusades Campaign, it is suggested that the PC party, no matter the level, have at least one rogue or assassin for dealing with traps, one arcane spellcaster, one divine spell caster, and a solid mix of other character classes (especially melee combat experts such as fighters, barbarians and rangers) to successfully explore the battered remnants of the Conquered East.<br/><br/>Detailed within this book is an overview of the forces which Yorgach has left behind to lay siege to West Dro Mandras. Here the Castle Keeper finds details on the various lairs of Yorgach&rsquo;s captains. Here too is found the Mausoleum of Honored Dead, the tunnels of the goblin sappers and the sacked Temple of Vanium the Fearless. Also detailed is the last bastion of freedom within the Eastern City.  That being the Besieged East Central district, held now by  fifty brave paladins, and priests, doughty adventurers who refused retreat, and the inspiration of Galian, the half-elven warrior poet.<br/><br/>Dro Mandos II is a scaled adventure and allows CKs and players latitude in running low to mid level games in the confines of the city. The areas of adventure detailed within this tome are fluid rather than static.<br/><br/>"}, "65129": {"rpgartist": ["Den Beauvais", "Dan Burr", "Ken Frank", "James Holloway", "Dennis Kauth", "David O.

Players who made their bid exactly, score 10 points plus a bonus of the number of tricks taken squared.

(IPH). It&rsquo;s a low-to-intermediate complexity, strategic/operational-level, alternative history wargame of the campaign that could've resulted had the Japanese decided to launch an amphibious invasion of Oahu at the same time as their historic air raid. The game is intended for two players, one commanding the Japanese and the other commanding the US forces. The game system is focused so as to present the ground-commanders&rsquo; views of the campaign. Aero-naval operations &ndash; though certainly important in play &ndash; are presented more abstractly than would be the case in a design centered on those aspects of the campaign.<br/><br/>Each hex on the 34x22 large-hex map equals one mile (1.62 km) from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents about four hours of daylight or an entire night. Playing pieces (176 iconic counters) represent ground units of approximately company size, or individual aircraft carriers or battleships, or enough aircraft sorties (about two to three dozen) needed to affect battlefield events at this scale. The rules contain a little less than 11,000 words. Two experienced players can finish a match in less than four hours.<br/><br/>The single counterfactual assumption underlying the game is Adm. Yamamoto decided to back the plan he scrapped historically in September 1941. That plan had called for an amphibious invasion, conducted by about two regiments, to land on Oahu at the same time as the air attacks were begun. The further supposition then is, the Japanese, once ashore, would&rsquo;ve had no more than about three days in which to achieve their now more ambitious goal: either secure the whole island or at least fight their way across enough of it &ndash; while thoroughly wrecking facilities as they came to them &ndash; to ensure the American recovery would be delayed as long as possible. The three-day limit is due to the fact that, by the end of that period, the Japanese carrier strike group would had to have withdrawn and the ground force&rsquo;s initial load of combat supply would be used up.<br/><br/>Rules cover such things as: variable landing sites, rough surf, carrier interventions, combat ground support, interdiction, a Nisei uprising, Ford Island and Battleship Row, night combat, banzai attacks and much more. The turn sequence is as follows.<br/><br/>I. Carrier Warfare Phase (only Game Turns 5 &amp; 9)<br/>A. Ship Disposition Segment<br/>B. Carrier Combat Segment<br/>II. US Submarine Attack Phase (only Game Turns 5 through 11)<br/>III. Japanese Landing Phase<br/>IV. US Sub-Command Chit-Pull Phase*<br/>V. US Sub-Command Chit-Pull Phase*<br/>VI.

Instead of winning by competing with other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game. Players take turns moving their pawns around the 'island', which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles before play begins. As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made.<br/><br/>What causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game. It comes in a sturdy and organized tin of good shelf storage size. The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted and they fit just right into the box. The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image.<br/><br/>With multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from (each with a special ability of their own), many optional island formats and game variations available, Forbidden Island has huge replay value. The game can be played by as few as two players and up to four (though it can accommodate five). More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though the extra help can make all the difference. This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age. Selling for under twenty dollars, oddly, Forbidden Island is a rare game of both quality and affordable price.<br/> For those who enjoy Forbidden Island, a follow-up project by Gamewright titled Forbidden Desert was released in 2013.<br/><br/>From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>Dare to discover Forbidden Island!

There are two sets of cards; large cards that show full drawings, and smaller cards that show individual parts of the full drawings. Each full drawing on a large card consists of three main parts. Therefor there are three small cards for each large card.<br/><br/>Both sets of cards are put face down on the playing area. You can choose to mix the large and small cards together in one group, or to have them as two separate groups.<br/><br/>In a turn a player first flips over one of the large cards which will show a full drawing. For example: A bird in a nest on a branch. Then the player flips over a small card, trying to match it with the full drawing on the large card that's already flipped over. In the example mentioned, a matching small card should show a drawing of either the bird, the nest or the branch.<br/><br/>If no match is made, both the large and small cards are to be flipped over again, face down. If a match is made, the player gets to keep only the small card; the large card has to be flipped over again. However, if the matching small card is the last of the small cards remaining for the specific large card, then the player gets to keep both cards.<br/><br/>A player is allowed another turn whenever he/she is able to collect a small tile. If a player collects both a large and a small card, it's the next players' turn.<br/><br/>Should a player overlook the fact that the collected small card was the last one of the set remaining, and flip over the large card so that it is facing down again instead of collecting it, then any player in his/her own turn can still collect this large card. A player doing so has to mention that the large card he/she collects does not have any of its small cards remaining. Collecting a single large card also means that it's the next players' turn.<br/>A player that overlooks to collect a large card does however get another turn since he/she did collect a small card. He/she can still use this extra turn to collect the large card, so other players are warned not to rejoice openly to quickly as this might trigger him/her to do just that!<br/><br/>If a player collects a large card, the remaining large cards have to be shuffled.<br/>Whenever a single player manages to collect a full set of cards (1 large card and its 3 small cards), all remaining cards (large and small) have to be shuffled.<br/><br/>The game ends when there are no more cards to be collected. To determine the winner, the cards are counted and scored as follows:<br/><br/><br/>     1 point for each small card<br/>     2 points for each large card (except for the last collected large card; No points for that!)<br/>     3 bonus points for each complete set of cards (1 large card and its 3 small cards)<br/><br/><br/>The player that gets the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Prototype edition"], "name": "Pick-A-Part", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Memory", "Set Collection"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Children's Games"], "age": "5"}, "65291": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "JAG-GER The Strategy Jigsaw Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic978998_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Paraphrase, Inc."], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic978998.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Puzzle"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>&quot;JAG-GER is the first true family game in years.

They can also earn money through missions (usually to steal information from Datastores).<br/><br/>The matrix consists of computer systems, each with its own address. Usually at the beginning of a mission the character is given the address of a system to hack and the knowledge of what they're looking for. The GM constructs this system ahead of time plus the Artificial Intelligence (AI) programs that guard it. These computer systems consist of Nodes. Each Node connects to another and each has specific tasks. Most Nodes have a rating, which determines who hard it is to use or pass through them. They also have AI guarding them that the character will have to fool or battle. Failing to do these things can trigger alarms that alert the owners of these systems. Then things get harder as the employed hackers from those systems login to try and discover the cause of the alarm.<br/><br/>This game actually does have a &quot;happy ending&quot; for the characters.

You can play either of those two words on either of the two words that are currently displayed on the deck (like &quot;Drink&quot; / &quot;Angel&quot;).<br/><br/>Sure, the first few rounds are simple, since you have lots of different ways to play out the possibilities in your hand, but you had better plan ahead and pay attention to what cards your opponents have, because the game gets trickier in the final few rounds.  Don't get caught drawing a fist full of cards when your opponents are almost out!<br/><br/>To make the game even more challenging, your opponent might zing you at any time by slapping you with a &quot;Double Joker&quot; or a &quot;Double Angel&quot; card that contains the same word in both directions, doubling the chances that you'll have to draw!<br/><br/>Of course, you could plan to zing them back with a &quot;Double Siren&quot;, but don't get caught holding that card in your hand for long, because not only is it twice as hard for your opponent to play on, it's also twice as hard for you to get rid of!  You had better plan ahead, or your scheme to attack at the end when it can hurt the most might come back to bite YOU!<br/><br/>Simple to learn, but filled with plenty of twists (literally), Ambigram! the game provides hours of fun for the whole family.<br/><br/>About the Playing Cards<br/><br/>The Ambigram deck itself is a wonder of modern technology that no human being could have designed alone, even if they possessed several lifetimes to work on the problem.<br/><br/>Instead, a computer was given the task of finding the words to use for the cards.  It was programmed to go through the entire English Dictionary, word by word, and locate 7 words that could all form an ambigram with themselves, and also form an ambigram with every one of the other 7 words that were being located - a total of 49 ambigrams in all.<br/><br/>It took the computer 16 days to go through the Dictionary and return the answer: Angel, Drink, Finger, Joker, Killer, Learn and Siren - the amazing set of words that make up all of the 49 cards for Ambigram! the Game.

Cargoes have a fixed buying price and profit depends on which port they are sold in. Each port provides 1 or 2 types of cargo, roughly historical - London wants tar and timber, provides luxuries and salt - and by trading in this way, players try to amass the biggest fortune before the cargoes run out.<br/><br/>Each round a player can sell or buy cargo and buy a bigger ship (carries 2 units) or cannon, which protects from pirates. Movement is by dice rolling, and before sailing a player takes a 'sea-card' with varying results - a pilot who helps in reaching the next port, pirates who steal the cargo, favourable or adverse winds or a special price event. The latter are also historical, such as the unrest following the French Revolution causing increased demand for grain in Amsterdam, or events of the Crimean War.<br/><br/>When the last cargo is bought, the game ends and the player with most money wins.<br/><br/>"}, "65405": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic648497.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["J\u00fcrgen Adams"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2004", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Neuland ID"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Kraul", "smada verlag"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic648497_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Dice"], "description": "Each player controles a group of artists and<br/>attempts to make a performence in a circus.<br/>Before thye get there, they must gather enought practice. <br/>On their path, the players can decide where to go by playing cards from thier hand. <br/>Depending on the location, different artists have different probability to improve thier skills.

The dragons, fabulous creatures, are asleep and each of them dreams a creature ; but at the same time, all of them dream the world. When a creature dies, his dragon awakes, but as the creature is also dreamt by the other dragons, its body remains.<br/><br/>This is a metaphor of the role-playing game itself : when players gather to play, they imagine - dream - together an adventure, and each player imagines his own character.<br/><br/>As well as different stories often interfere (e.g. a player plays different games in the same week), the different dreams (worlds, universe) can interfere; there are rips between them, and the character can go to a different world sometimes without noticing it! Strange creatures can also come to the present dream.<br/><br/>Just like a sleeper has only partial control over his dreams, why would we have nightmares otherwise ? the dragons do not completely control their creatures and worlds. The dreamed creatures have the possibility to modify the dream (the world) itself ; this is the source of magic, highdreaming.<br/><br/>The life of a character is fuzzy between the game sessions ; the player only has little ideas of what happens to his creature. In the same way, characters of R&ecirc;ve de Dragon sometimes experience a gris-r&ecirc;ve (greydreaming): they suddenly realise that they are somewhere with companions, but only have limited memories of what happened the days before. But what happened can be the key of the current situation...<br/><br/>When a character dies, his dragon wakes up and then falls asleep again ; at the same time, the character wakes up in a new dream, a new life. This means that the character is recreated with the same abilities, but a different past, a different job, different skills, a different name. The player thus plays the same character again. well, not exactly the same : the character is not a newborn, he is already adult, just coming from another dream.<br/><br/>The &quot;sum&quot; of all these incarnations are the archetype of the character. When the character is himself sleeping, he can remember his past incarnations, and thus learn skills he never practiced nor studied. These memories of a past life can also be the key of the adventure...&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;R\u00eave_de_Dragon,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "65462": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Heike Pfeifle"], "poll": [], "name": "Cut!", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic648893_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unpublished)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic648893.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Educational"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The learners are Telecommunications and Film students who have just completed a unit on continuity in films.<br/><br/>Given a Cut! deck, the learner will be able to distinguish between shots taken from either side of a scene (see Figure 1: The axis of interaction) by sequencing the shots represented on the cards in Cut! without interrupting the continuity of the sequence.

Everyone needs something, and these shady assets are there to supply it to them for a nominal fee. Owning dealers will make you money each turn.<br/><br/>MUSCLE are your strong men, used in a variety of situations. They are your personal bodyguards and can be sent out to any assets you deem in need of some protection. They can also hassle businesses into giving up protection fees, making them invaluable.<br/><br/>BUSINESSES are the most legitimate, and therefore least cost efficient, way of making money. Businesses are in general the most expensive assets in the game, but they are especially helpful because they cannot be targeted by hitmen.<br/><br/>These are the resources at your disposal. If you can use them correctly nothing will stand in your way. But always be on your guard; you're not the only one willing to do what it takes.<br/><br/>Get some friends together and become enemies. Or get some enemies together and become friends. This is a party game full of deceit, betrayel, and the most nefarious of schemes.
