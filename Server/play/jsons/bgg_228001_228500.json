And then there is the truly unpleasant side to their work&hellip;<br/><br/>Covert Actions presents six deadly sets of missions for agents of Section 46. Each includes an official objective, suitable for officers of Britain&rsquo;s Secret Intelligence Service or allies in other Western foreign intelligence services.<br/><br/>These missions are filled with the dangers, intrigue and moral compromises that define espionage in the 1970s.<br/><br/>Lurking under the surface of each of these missions is a second, even deadlier objective, assigned by N or his cohort in Section 46. These objectives will place N&rsquo;s agents in existential danger, faced with ancient threats beyond human comprehension.<br/><br/>Failure in either of these missions is likely to result in not only the destruction of the investigators, but a shift in the balance of greater, deadlier conflicts.<br/><br/>1970: The investigators find themselves at the centre of an ugly web of moral compromises and dirty expediencies in Puddles Become Lakes, by Matthew Dawkins. A routine, if unpleasant mission to silence a nosy journalist proves more complicated than first thought when the investigators discover that her research exposes not only espionage and treason, but tendrils of eldritch conspiracy.<br/><br/>1972: Scott Dorward&rsquo;s The Forcing Move takes the investigators to Reykjavik, where the World Chess Championship reflects in microcosm the paranoia and weirdness of the Cold War. As reality crumbles around the investigators, they must complete an increasingly complicated mission that risks the very reputation of Section 46.<br/><br/>1974: The Turkish invasion of Cyprus provides the backdrop for Cadenza, Matthew Sanderson&rsquo;s eerie scenario of cosmic horror. As the investigators learn the truth of the situation, they must make a horrifying decision or face deadly consequences.<br/><br/>1974: Nick Robinson&rsquo;s Guardians of the Forest sees the investigators aiding their allies in Australian intelligence,<br/>carrying out a dirty tricks campaign in East Timor as the country descends into bloodshed and atrocity. The two missions intersect in the worst possible way as the investigators discover that the man whose reputation they have been sent to destroy holds the key to defeating ancient horrors.<br/><br/>1970&ndash;79: Operation Header, by Ken Spencer, sends the investigators to the High Arctic, where they must discover why a Distant Early Warning listening post has gone silent. Once on site, they quickly discover that they face a threat far older and stranger than the Soviets.<br/><br/>1970&ndash;79: In Chad Bowser&rsquo;s The Unclean, agents of Section 46 stationed in Moscow must contain the consequences of a death cult&rsquo;s unholy rituals while operating under the noses of the KGB.

The game consists of three of the negotiating settings that represented critical junctures. The game begins in 1979 at the Geneva, Switzerland UNEC meeting. This meeting led to a treaty with no specific goals and no enforcement. It did provide money for research that showed the extent of the problem and provided the scientific data to support a stronger treaty. The second section of the game is the Helsinki, Finland meeting in 1984 at which binding limits were finally included in the treaty. The final session in Sophia, Bulgaria expanded the treaty beyond sulfur dioxide pollution and included nitrogen oxide pollution as well.

It was purposely developed to bridge the unfortunate division that often exists in students&rsquo; minds between natural science and the humanities and social sciences. In particular, it is designed to impress on the students the importance for everyone to be able to evaluate the scientific claims that appear daily in the popular media. Without this ability, it is difficult for students to make decisions on what to eat, how to deal with personal health, and how to vote on important issues of policy related to the environment. Similarly, it is important for science students to understand the policy implications of scientific research and how it may be applied.<br/><br/>To facilitate multiple uses of the game, optional material has been placed in appendices. Instructors can omit this material completely. The days in the setup of the game that would be devoted to this material can be spent instead helping students understand how to evaluate popular scientific material in the media. You can also use this time to work with factions to help them understand the summaries of technical material provided in the core documents in the gamebook.<br/><br/>There is some scientific content as well as some quantitative material that is essential to many games at the interface of science and policy. For example, the Acid Rain game expects that students and instructors can divide emissions by GDP to get emissions per dollar of GDP and similar ratios. Most RTTP science games require students to read simple graphs. We consider these core college level skills. This game also includes summaries of technical papers that are important to various roles. The student Gamebook has a section that discusses how to approach technical material. Instructors should never hesitate to refer students to their science or math colleagues if students ask questions that they really can&rsquo;t answer. Again, this will model the import interdisciplinary aspects of the subjects of the games and the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration for applying science to public policy.<br/><br/>"}, "228080": {"average": "0", "videogamebg": ["Flash Point: Fire Rescue"], "name": "Flash Point: Fire Rescue", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iOS edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic983231.png", "videogametheme": ["Business/Construction"], "videogamegenre": ["Simulation"], "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamefranchise": ["(Unreleased Games - Unavailable)"], "videogameplatform": ["iPad", "iPhone"], "usersrated": "0", "poll": [], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic983231_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Comes with 2 houses and plenty of victims to rescue as well as 8 different fire fighters each with his or her own ability to choose from.<br/><br/>"}, "228082": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["DOCX Version 4.6"], "poll": [], "name": "Challenging the USDA Food Pyramid - 1991", "rpgdesigner": ["David E.

The USDA had developed the material, made it public, then withdraw it under political pressure for additional study, and finally released essentially the same material a year later. Congress wants to know if the USDA has developed a scientifically valid recommendation on diet and to what extent political considerations were involved in the process.<br/><br/>There are two important intellectual ideas in this game, one scientific and one political. The scientific issue is encapsulated in the &ldquo;eat more &ndash; eat less&rdquo; controversy that is at the heart of the food pyramid debate. The game occurs during a period when the role of diet in health was being transformed by new research. The USDA, which had historically dealt primarily with malnutrition, was suddenly faced with evidence that certain foods could either cause or prevent serious illness. What should be the role of fat in the diet? Should we eat less fat, more fat? Or only certain kinds of fat?  How much meat is needed for optimal health? Do adults need to drink milk? Should people eat more fresh vegetables and fruits?<br/><br/>The second issue has to do with the regulatory structure of the US government and whether a single agency can serve multiple, conflicting roles. In this case, the USDA has three different, roles. It is charged with promotion of all agriculture in the United States with particular emphasis on the meat and dairy industries. It also regulates most meat and most dairy products to insure safety.  Finally, it is charged with educating the public about how much of these food should be eaten for good health. This creates a conflict when research suggests people should eat less of the foods that the USDA is charged with promoting.<br/><br/>Because the regulatory issues in the game are still very much in play today, this aspect of the game is directly relevant to public policy. Different aspects of food safety are covered by a number of different Federal agencies. An example of this fragmentation is that frozen cheese pizza is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration while frozen pepperoni pizza by the USDA.<br/><br/>"}, "228083": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["DOCX Version 4.6"], "poll": [], "name": "Challenging the USDA Food Pyramid Instructor's Manual and Roles", "rpgdesigner": ["David E.

It will provide a general overview of what happens, without spoiling anything. A good premise contains, explicitly or by implication, four key elements of the story: who the protagonists are, what the goal of the story is, the sorts of obstacles that need to be overcome to achieve the story goal, and who the antagonist is.<br/><br/>Each premise provided in this book is more than just a story hook or adventure seed. It is the beginning of a story, your story, that you can flesh out and develop to suit your specific needs. These can be used again and again by varying the details and changing the four key elements.<br/><br/><br/>Protagonists<br/><br/>The assumption is that you already have player characters created, if not fully established. For that reason, elements of the premise should be tweaked to suit the abilities and personalities of the protagonists and not the other way around. Suggested character capabilities useful in completing the story goal may be listed, but if no protagonist possesses these traits then a supporting character should be inserted to compensate. Likewise, ties to background elements can either be retconned into a protagonist's history, or given to a supporting character who can ask for the protagonists' help, or hires them to pursue the story goal on their behalf, as appropriate.<br/><br/><br/>Story Goals<br/><br/>The story goal is the objective that the protagonists must achieve in order to successfully complete the adventure. It&rsquo;s the way you know that the story is over, and can help keep the players focused and the protagonists on the right track. In a simplified 3-act structure, Act 1 will have the protagonists learning about the story goal and deciding to pursue it. Act 2 will present a series of obstacles that need to be overcome in order to accomplish the story goal. Act 3 will have the protagonists face the final obstacle, defeat the antagonist, achieve the story goal, and earn their rewards.<br/><br/><br/>Obstacles<br/><br/>Achieving the story goal shouldn&rsquo;t be easy, and the protagonists will need to overcome an escalating series of obstacles. These might be linked thematically, or tied into the sort of goal that needs to be achieved. Start with a simple obstacle early in the story, something that plays to the protagonists&rsquo; strengths and will be relatively easy to defeat. Then think of the hardest thing possible, pushing the limits of their capabilities, and make that the final obstacles. Flesh out the middle with obstacles that are increasingly more difficult.<br/><br/><br/>Antagonists<br/><br/>Each protagonist has a personal goal that they are trying to achieve, as well as a motivation for pursuing that goal. This might place them in opposition to, ior nto competition with, the protagonists. If the premise fits with an established antagonist, you should use them and tweak other elements of the premise to fit their personalities and abilities. Otherwise, you can create a new antagonist that suits the particulars of your desired story and overall campaign needs.<br/><br/>"}, "228136": {"rpgartist": ["Michael Brock", "Becca Gowdy", "Ben Herrera", "James McLaughlin", "Quinn McSherry", "Jason Moser", "Jen Sorrell", "Beth Varni", "Lindsey Wagner"], "rpg": ["Murders & Acquisitions"], "statistics": [], "name": "Murders & Acquisitions Employee Manual: Downsized Edition", "rpgdesigner": ["Craig Campbell", "Tim Eagon", "Ray Franklin", "Dale A.
