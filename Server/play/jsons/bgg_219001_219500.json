Reports from distant lands even say that those creatures which spend enough time - months or years - with the king slowly transform into foul Goat-Men, building a society which is a cruel mockery of a human one.

With timely moves, you can place your opponent in a state of DURESS!<br/><br/>Duress is a two-player strategic board game.  It is intended for adults and children ages 8 and up.<br/><br/>Each player has 16 tiles with different letters (A through P).  These same tiles are arranged as Goal Pieces in the middle of the board.  The Goal Pieces are arranged symmetrically, equidistant from the two players.  Once a layout is selected, the Goal Pieces are arranged in a random order.  The two players may also decide to take turns selecting the placement of the individual tiles, which adds strategy to the game.<br/><br/>There are also Movement Pieces corresponding to chess pieces.  In a classic game of Duress, there are 16 Movement Pieces: 8 pawns, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, 1 queen, and 1 king.<br/><br/>Once the Goal Pieces are arranged, the two players take turns.  In a single turn, the player:<br/><br/>a) Selects a Movement Piece at random.<br/><br/>b) Selects one of the tiles to move.<br/><br/>c) Moves the selected tile to a new location based on the Movement Piece.  Other tiles can block the movements of the pieces, creating opportunities for strategic play.<br/><br/>Players score points by landing their pieces on the corresponding Goal Pieces before the opponent can get there.  So, the two A tiles are racing to reach the A in the Goal Pieces.  The same goes for each letter.<br/><br/>A player wins the game by scoring a majority of the points.<br/><br/>There are many opportunities to change the structure of the game:<br/><br/>a) Each game randomizes the order of the Goal Pieces, creating a different strategic challenge for the players.<br/><br/>b) Players can take turns selecting the order of the Goal Pieces, creating additional strategy.  When one player goes first in the selection, and the other goes first in moving pieces, the potential for a first player's bias can be mitigated.<br/><br/>c) The players may create alternative layouts for the board.<br/><br/>d) As an alternative, players may select and hold 3 pieces.  This allows for planning moves in advance.  With each turn, the player will select one of the three movement pieces, move a tile, return this piece to the bag, and randomly select a new one.<br/><br/>With many potential variations, no two games of Duress are exactly alike.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "8", "name": "Duress", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Tile Placement"], "average": "10", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Chess Games"]}, "219160": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Kody Chamberlain", "Joshua Hale Fialkov"], "average": "8", "poll": [], "name": "Punks: The Game \u2013 Nutpuncher!", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Rock-Paper-Scissors", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Kody Chamberlain"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)", "Image Comics"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Comic Book / Strip", "Print & Play"], "age": "13", "minplaytime": "5", "description": "A twelve card, two player, print and play game derived from the first issue of Punks THE COMIC by Joshua Fialkov and Kody Chamberlain.<br/><br/>Players assume the role of either Dog or Skull and take the corresponding 6 cards into their hand.<br/><br/>These include:<br/>2 x Attack Cards<br/>2 x Defense Cards<br/>1 x Nut Puncher<br/>1 x Bummer<br/><br/>Players put down one card each on the count of 3.

APEX is a check on the ever growing numbers of metahuman vigilantes, non-governmental organizations, terror cells and private security teams.<br/><br/>APEX troops are among the best trained and best equipped in the Americas, drilled extensively in urban tactics, counter-terrorism, and anti-Powered warfare. In addition to exemplary training, APEX troops are enhanced with military grade genemods, combat focused object philosophy indoctrination and the best cyber-enhancement protocol money can buy. A single veteran APEX super soldier is designed to be a match for a full enemy light platoon, despite the huge costs involved in training and molding a soldier to that level.<br/><br/>Included in this massive sourcebook are a host of new player races. In the Otherverse America setting civilian genetic engineering is as common as tattooing, and each citizen of 22nd Century America is a species of one, custom designed to survive the rigors of a war-torn, segregated future.<br/><br/>New human races have emerged.<br/><br/>The world's megacorps and America's military elite began using in-vitro gene-cutting to custom build workers and combat troops as early as the 2030s. The same &lsquo;genetic revolution' that gave the world the AIDS cure, the first generation of engineered Powereds and laid the cornerstone of the Covenant pseudo-nation also gave birth to a new breed of slavery. A series of Supreme Court decisions during the 2050s freed many of the &lsquo;engineered' races, and forced an already overstressed America to come to terms with the myriad new sentient species now living among them.<br/><br/>"}, "219206": {"rpgdesigner": ["Christopher A.

All major conflicts get solved in the ARENA, where the best fighters represent entire Nations. Such fighters, with good reason, are called HEROES.<br/><br/>In this turn-based tactical combat boardgame, players recruit teams of three or four from a wide pool of Heroes, all of them experts in a Combat Role, like Tactician, Healer and Bruiser. There are countless combos, counterpicks and strategies to explore in the attempt to build a powerful and synergistic team.<br/><br/>Each Hero is granted a Move and an Attack action per turn. Its governing rules are intuitive, meaning even beginners will find ARENA easy to learn; however, the game will forever remain challenging, as it is impossible to reproduce two equal matches, all attacks are unique, and there are optional 'advanced' features to implement in order to refresh and deepen the experience, such as Artifacts, Scrolls and Heroic Actions.<br/><br/>In Competitive mode (PvP), both teams fight each other until one eliminates all opposition and wins the battle. Matches begin by strategically positioning highly-detailed miniatures in an infinitely customizable battlefield featuring optional elements that change the dynamics of combat, such as walls, debris, altars and fire. You're required to plan ahead, consider your enemies' moves and work in harmony with your team in order to find the best possible action when your turn comes. There's also a funny variant to PvP called &quot;Capture the Orb&quot;, characterized by infinite respawns and the goal of capturing and bringing the opponent's Orb to one's own base.<br/><br/>In Cooperative mode (PvE), the Player(s) build a team of 4 Heroes to travel the fantastic world of Tanares in order to solve a mystery, facing Missions with different problems, hazards, and goals. Campaign Cards present players with challenging events, requiring tough decisions that shape the course - and outcome - of an adventure that find its climaxes in the difficult Dragon Boss Fights. All enemies in this mode are automated, but a player may assume control, to create a &quot;one vs all&quot; situation.<br/><br/>The Campaign is meant to be conducted through the course of several sessions, in which Heroes gain experience according to the number - and quality - of accomplished Mission objectives. Experience Points can be spent to Level UP and acquire minor permanent boosts, or to purchase Items that grant major - but provisory - boosts to any Hero.<br/><br/>Players are free to tweak and adjust their experience according to their personal preferences, making Arena a highly diverse and replayable game. Players can make tournament tables and play simultaneous Matches on different boards; add or subtract different advanced rules and strategical features at will; try the game on custom boards or design their own missions. Players that enjoy immersion and storytelling can minimize action and maximize adventure in PvE-Campaign Mode, while players adverse to that can even play the Quests individually, in any sequence, with minimum reading required<br/><br/>"}, "219218": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Arcan Myth Scheda del Personaggio", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3376190.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Arcan Myth"], "rpgpublisher": ["Archons GdR"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Low Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3376190_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>A two-page PDF character sheet, intended for print-and-play use.<br/><br/>"}, "219219": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Joseph Pendergast"], "average": "4.4", "poll": [], "name": "Birds and Squirrels: black bird edition", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Press Your Luck", "Simulation"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Joseph Pendergast"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Scolopendra Games"], "boardgameversion": ["Black Bird Edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Card Game", "Party Game", "Real-time"], "age": "4", "minplaytime": "5", "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>A Kickstarted creation.

Then, each player selects 3 of their Quests to keep and returns the remainder facedown to the bottom of the Quest Deck. Each round players draft a 7 card hand. Cards are passed either clockwise or counter clockwise depending on the round. Players then take turns playing as many cards as they can from their hand, provided they have the resources to do so.<br/><br/>Randomly determine which player will play first during the Play Phase. The starting player will alternate in a clockwise fashion during each of the four rounds.<br/><br/>Playing Cards:<br/>To play Heroes and Weapons, players must spend Gold equal to the Gold Cost in the upper left corner of the card. Spent Gold is returned to the common pool of available Gold.<br/><br/>Heroes and Weapons remain in front of you when played. Some Heroes and Weapons have special text abilities that take effect when played.<br/><br/>All Heroes and Weapons will only have effects that last for the remainder of the round, with the exception of providing Attack, Gold, and XP (i.e. ignore everything but the numbers and symbols on the left side of the card during future rounds).<br/><br/>Class Icons:<br/>Each Hero and Weapon has a class. Classes are indicated by card color and icon. Class is very important! Many powers on Heroes and Weapons can only be used if you control enough cards of the appropriate class.<br/><br/>Monsters<br/>To defeat Monsters, players must have Attack equal to or greater than the Monster Attack Cost in the upper left corner of the card. Attack is not &ldquo;spent&rdquo; like Gold, so a player can defeat any number of Monsters whose Attack Cost is lower than or equal to the combined Attack of all cards you control.<br/><br/>Some Monsters have a text box with special effects on the card. After you defeat one of these Monsters, follow the instructions and then put the Monster into the Draft Deck Discard Pile.<br/><br/>Some Monsters have XP or Gold values on the card. After you defeat one of these Monsters, take the corresponding XP and/or Gold from the <br/>corresponding pool and then put the Monster into the Draft Deck Discard Pile.<br/><br/>Quests<br/>To play Quests, players must have Heroes and Weapons of the appropriate class. Quests have no cost other than this requirement. Unlike Heroes and Weapons, Quest Cards may have abilities that can be used over multiple rounds.<br/><br/>End of Turn<br/>Once a player has finished playing any cards they wish to play (and has the resources to play), they must:<br/>&bull; Discard all unplayed Draft Cards to the Draft Deck Discard Pile (do not discard Quest Cards OR played Heroes and Weapons).<br/>&bull; Gain 5 Gold plus additional Gold equal to the total Gold Production on all cards in front of you.<br/>&bull; Play passes to the next player.<br/><br/>End of Round<br/>Once all players have completed the Play Phase, the next round will begin. In each round, the starting player will rotate clockwise (i.e. the<br/>player who played second in the previous round will start the next round). TIP: At the end of each round, it is helpful to stack all of your played Heroes and Weapons so that only their icons are visible. This clears room for the next round&rsquo;s cards and helps to avoid confusion since only the icon powers remain in effect for future rounds.<br/><br/>After four rounds have been completed, players tally up XP to determine the winner.

These cards form each player&rsquo;s Life Deck. Players can never look at the cards in their Life Deck unless the game or a card effect allows them to.<br/><br/>Playing the Game:<br/>The game is played in a series of rounds. During each round, players take turns in trying to summon cards. A round ends when only one player remains, making that player the winner of that round. A new round then begins.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, each eliminated player will take damage, which is represented by discarding cards from their Life Deck. If you are eliminated and have no cards in your Life Deck, then you are defeated and are out of the game. The last player remaining in the game wins!<br/><br/>The Turn:<br/>The player who was randomly chosen to go first takes the first turn of the opening round. On your turn, you must try to summon a card. Initially, you&rsquo;ll try to summon a card from the Draw Deck, but as the game progresses you might be able to summon cards from your reserves as you accumulate them. To summon a card from the top of the Draw Deck, reveal that card. If its strength is greater than the strength of the last card you summoned, then you&rsquo;ve successfully summoned that card. Place it to the right of the last card you summoned. This is known as Escalating.<br/><br/>If you summoned the card successfully, you may use any Summon ability that it may have; though using it is entirely optional. If the card&rsquo;s strength is not greater than the last card you summoned, then discard the card you drew from the Draw Deck, and you are eliminated from the round. Discard any other cards you summoned this round.<br/><br/>After a player summons a card, or fails to summon a card, play passes to the player with the lowest total strength among their summoned cards. If there is a tie, and the current player is one of the tied players, then the current player takes the next turn. Otherwise, play passes to the next player to their left that is tied for lowest. If the Draw Deck runs out of cards, shuffle the cards in the discard pile to make a new Draw Deck.<br/><br/>Ending the Round:<br/>A round ends when only one player remains in the round. The winning player adds up the damage values of their summoned cards. Each &lsquo;Red dot&rsquo; on a summoned card represents a single damage point. Each opponent takes that much damage, starting with the player to the winner&rsquo;s left, and going around the table. Once each player has taken their damage from their Life Deck, the winner discards their summoned cards and becomes the starting player for the next round.<br/><br/>The Life Deck:<br/>Whenever you take damage, draw that many cards from your Life Deck and choose one of them to go to your reserves. Discard the other cards.<br/>If you&rsquo;re out of cards while drawing, you are still in the game &mdash; you don&rsquo;t get defeated until you take damage while having no cards in your Life Deck.<br/><br/>If an ability allows you to gain life, put that many cards from the Draw Deck on top of your Life Deck without looking at them.<br/><br/>The Reserves:<br/>Whenever you place a card in your reserves, put it next to your Life Deck so you don&rsquo;t confuse it with the cards you summon during the round. If the card has a Reserve ability, you may play it now. Whenever you must summon a card, you may choose to summon one from your reserves instead of revealing a card from the Draw Deck. You can choose any card with strength greater than the last card you summoned this round and put it to the right of that card. If it has a Summon ability, you may play it &mdash; play then passes per the normal rules.<br/><br/>Abilities:<br/>Most abilities on cards have a keyword that tells you when to play that ability. Playing summon, reserve, and aftermath abilities are always optional. <br/>Summon: Play this when you successfully summon the card.<br/>Reserve: Play this when the card is placed into your reserves, regardless of where it came from.<br/>Aftermath: Play this when you are eliminated from a round or at the end of the round that you won.<br/><br/>Cards have special abilities that do not fall under any other ability category are considered to be &ldquo;always on,&rdquo; even while they are in your reserves. These abilities are not optional.<br/><br/>Telling the Fortune:<br/>Once the game is over, if the winner had any cards left in their Life Deck, they use those cards to divine the future. That player shuffles those cards and lays them out, face-up, one at a time. The first card represents the present, the second represents the immediate future, and the rest divine the far future. It&rsquo;s up to the players to interpret what those cards mean.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "age": "14", "name": "Dread Draw", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Player Elimination"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games"]}, "219279": {"poll": [], "name": "Aquaventure", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Atari 2600"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Ocean / Sea"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Atari, Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade"], "videogameplatform": ["Atari 2600"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Atari, Inc."], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>You are a diver armed with a harpoon gun.

Oh, and also drinking and gambling.<br/><br/>We present, for your entertainment, a new sort of party game for adults. Fair warning, though, it contains drinking, racing, expenditure of petty cash, and all manner of chicanery. Have you ever wondered if you were the fastest thigh-poker around? Are you confident that you could portray the most convincing withered crone? Do you excel at eloquence while inebriated? Want to win money from your friends? Do you enjoy judging the wit and skills of your peers? If you answered affirmatively to any of these, Hissy Fit is the game for you!<br/><br/>Oh, and it also pays for itself the first time that you win, provided you play for real money. Now that's value!<br/><br/>A game of Hissy Fit consists of players dividing into teams and competing against each other in bizarre and humorous challenges. These can be anything from &ldquo;First person to reach the Great Outdoors&rdquo; to &ldquo;Best Impromptu Facial Hair&rdquo; to the dreaded &ldquo;Slurgeon General&rdquo;, where a player will be forced to navigate a tricky tongue twister. After judgement is passed, losing players pay a dollar in tribute, and the winner flips their coin to determine how the drinks are administered. If they&rsquo;re lucky, all the losers will drink, but if fortune turns against them, they drink instead. After much competition, the besotted winner gets a huge pile of cash, and the losers go home happy.<br/><br/>What's with the name? Well, in Hissy Fit, outbursts of laughter are both constant and contagious. Naturally,we decided to reward and punish it simultaneously. When the Hissy Fit token is invoked, all laughter is forbidden and only good-humored hissing is permitted. This effect persists only until someone screws up, but it is truly a sight to behold. As it happens, trying not to laugh is in fact more hilarious than just laughing, and the copious hissing adds tremendously to the fun.<br/><br/>It's a game that pits subjectivity against objectivity in winners. Want to win a &quot;Best&quot; challenge? You'll have to convince the judge of your superiority. Want to win a &quot;First&quot; challenge? Well, the only things standing in your way are your own limitations.

The player that slapped the card can take the top two cards from the center of the table and give them to any player of their choice. The player that made the mistake must pick up the rest and put them back into their hand.

There is a variant Version called Obscura (see below).<br/><br/>You woke up in a dark room, and you feel the presence of something horrible. You must get out of the room using your wisdom and luck.<br/><br/>To play the game, you need a die, two pawns, a pencil, and a printed square-grid play sheet.<br/><br/>You may move two squares in a turn, but must end your turn after you try to enter a new square, in which case you roll a die. You cannot move if the result is less than the movement difficulty designated on the original square. Otherwise, you move to the new square and roll a die to determine the movement difficulty for that square.<br/><br/>Then the monster moves. Basically it moves along the predetermined route, but while you are within the area of its sight, it approaches you.<br/><br/>You win the game if you reach the goal square without being captured by the monster.<br/><br/>The PnP files are on the designer's website (see Weblinks).

It was quickly pretty obvious that the Corps would need to adapt to get the job done.<br/><br/>The Marines were not prepared for this, as not everyone could carry a flame-thrower, therefore they needed something more practical. The Corps found its solution with the creation of the Demolition Squads. These men would be given basic instructions on how to handle explosives: throw a satchel full of them in roughly the right direction, and run the other way as fast as possible.<br/><br/>It was soon evident that if you were sent into one of these squads, you were soon to meet your maker - whatever you conceived Him to be. With such a high rate of casualties, they called themselves &lsquo;The Saints&rsquo;.

Yet other players want their alter egos to actually achieve something in their lives, have a place to return to between adventures, something to protect and care about.

It is truly unique. In my experience players often want some kind of a base, HQ, or castle to operate from, but their GMs either don&rsquo;t have time to do anything but &ldquo;Ok, this inn is your base now&rdquo; or, quite contrary, buy or develop a set of rules so complex that without an Excel spreadsheet it is impossible to control all these rooms, income sources, soldiers, servants and so on. What is more, in DnD 5 players often complain they have no way to spend the money they earn/loot/steal &ndash; magic items are usually found and lifestyles are too vague to care about.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Homeward Bound&rdquo; is lightweight (only 24 pages long) and it is purposefully short, but it provides a whole lot of options, for both game mechanics and the campaign&rsquo;s narrative. It gives the game a whole new angle, a home they can care for. It starts with descriptions of the house, in two versions for the GM/players to choose. If they want more &ndash; there is a set of upgrades they can purchase. These are not purely cosmetic additions, but provide tangible game effects, like extra hps or speed. If they want more &ndash; the camera pulls out and several neighbours are presented to visit or fight with. And finally, if they are hooked up, there is the Big Bad Guy &ndash; a framework for a campaign, that can be run on its own, or as an extension to the main story.<br/><br/>Although nominally for DnD5, it can be easily adapted to any game system. It&rsquo;s short, but full of ideas and options. It&rsquo;s unique. It&rsquo;s streamlined and easy to adapt to any campaign. It&rsquo;s easy on the eye.

In smaller cities this system may be as simple as a series of gutters which carries the contents of voided bladders, chamber pots, and garderobes through the open air into a local river or cesspit. More technically advanced cities often have systems of tunnels, or sewers, beneath the city. Sewers are designed to control waste water, refuse, and possibly even prevent flooding during high rains. Though they play a vital role in sanitation, sewers are often ill-maintained (out of sight, out of mind) and rarely patrolled. In fact, in most cities the only folks who are interested in the underground sewer networks tend to be smugglers and thieves, not guards or citizens.<br/><br/>In older cities, such sewers may not be the only structures or passages below the surface. Natural caverns, secret tunnels or vaults, local mines, garbage pits, and the remains of old cities may be intermingled with basements, cisterns, water wells, and rifts from unstable geology. In addition to the garbage and waste the city removes or stores below ground, unsavory characters use the dark pits to hide bodies, failed experiments, and contraband too risky to be caught with.

Players are competing treasure hunters, and at beginning of the game, each player has the same deck of cards, and each card is numbered 1-6. Two treasure cards (valued 11-15) are revealed on the table.<br/><br/>Players take turns placing a card from their hand on either of the treasure cards revealed. When the total value of the cards placed on the treasure equals to the treasure value, the current player takes the treasure and scores points. Then a new treasure comes on the table.<br/><br/>All cards in players' hands are public information except the one they would draw at the beginning of their turn. So you should play cards so that your rival doesn't take a treasure next turn, but sometimes you are forced to play a bad card, and there's some chance the rival would draw the exact card they want.<br/><br/>The game ends when all treasures are taken or both players passes in a row.

Being a tile-laying game, Ritual&rsquo;s core mechanic revolves around drawing hexagonal tiles one at a time from a common pool known as the ley line and placing them onto the scroll that serves as the board.<br/><br/>Each tile has three parts know as rune pieces. Throughout the game players try to match up identical rune pieces in groups of three known as runes. Runes players create can be activated to cause powerful effects capable of reshaping the board, but such power comes at a cost: influence. Each player gets a set of colored cubes known as influence cubes. These cubes are not only used to activate runes, but also to determine where you can play on the scroll and to tally your final score. Clever use of tiles, runes and influence is essential to winning a game of Ritual.<br/><br/>Ritual&rsquo;s simple gameplay, deep strategy and beautiful presentation make it a fun game for beginners and experienced board-gamers alike.<br/><br/>"}, "219438": {"poll": [], "name": "Bushido: Tsutsumi", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Dice Rolling", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2014", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3380787_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["GCT Studios"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3380787.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Miniatures", "Wargame"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This venerable monk is a seasoned defender of the Temple.

It allows 1 to 4 players to assume the roles of the Captain, the First Officer, the Navigator, and the Chief Engineer on board of a type VIIC U-boat. The game is enhanced by a companion app, allowing for an unprecedented level of realism, as well as a challenging enemy A.I. which will push your skills to the limit. The action unfolds both on the strategic and the tactical scale, always demanding teamwork, efficient crew management, and quick situation assessment.<br/><br/>Each of the four roles entails unique responsibilities, encouraging the players to develop an efficient communication scheme and use genuine navy terminology. The Captain oversees the completion of mission objectives, supervises action point costs, and is responsible for the crew's morale. The First Officer operates the companion app, manages the flow of information, and takes care of the crew's health. The Navigator steers the submarine by setting its course and depth, but also updates all the essential information on the strategic, and the tactical map. Last, but not least, is the Chief Engineer, who is responsible for the engines,  repairs, as well as other mechanical implements on board of the U-boat (such as the ballast tanks, weapon systems, etc.). At the same time, each of the four officers commands his own group of crew members by issuing orders within a worker placement system.<br/><br/>The idea behind the companion app is to deliver a real-time, realistic gameplay experience. To that end, the app features the most essential instruments of the u-boat (such as the periscope, the hydrophone, and the Enigma, among others). Rest assured, however, that the vast majority of gameplay traditionally takes place on the game board, with the instruments revealing otherwise hidden information, and the app requiring only certain data (such as the U-boat's course, speed, etc.) in order to generate an adequate A.I. response of the enemy force. It is also responsible for all the ambient sound effects, thus immersing the players even deeper into the claustrophobic interiors of the type VII C. But fear not! With open &amp; play being a design priority, you will be launching torpedoes in no time, thanks to streamlined rules, video tutorials, and variable difficulty levels for each player.<br/><br/>From quick skirmishes, through full combat missions, to an all-out campaign, UBOOT: TBG will let you conduct submarine operations in all major naval theatres of the 2nd World War. Success of these missions hinges on the completion of various tasks delegated to the crew by the Oberkommando der Kriegsmarine (German Navy HQ), which include patrol duty, ambushing convoys, laying mines in enemy waters, and many more! Each mission will require the players to adopt various strategies and playstyles in order to successfully complete it, and the companion app will generate a detailed report at the end of each game session (evaluating player efforts, and possibly awarding decorations, promotions, etc.). That is, if the U-boat makes it back home...<br/><br/>The stage is set and the crew is awaiting your orders. Do you have what it takes to command the Kriegsmarine's finest? Hunt or be hunted, as you brave the stormy seas of the greatest conflict in history!<br/><br/>"}, "219101": {"boardgamedesigner": ["David Thompson (I)"], "average": "8.08333", "poll": [], "name": "Pavlov's House", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Co-operative Play"], "yearpublished": "2017", "usersrated": "6", "maxplayers": "3", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3426348_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["David Thompson (I)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3426348.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>In Pavlov&rsquo;s House, you take control of the valiant defenders of a Soviet strongpoint in Stalingrad as they hold out against constant German attacks for almost two months.

In most worker placement games like Agricola, Stone Age that seems to be the case.<br/><br/>This game plays like a typical worker placement game. At the first round each player has 2 workers and they take turn placing their workers one by one onto the basic tiles. The basic tiles consisted of quarry(get a card and take first player),mining(get a card), construction(build a building), Education(increase a worker). At the end of each round you'd have to pay your worker salaries. If you don't have enough money to pay for the workers this round, you'd have to sell some of your private properties and it'd become public to cover the cost.<br/><br/>Here is the most interesting aspect about this game, unlike most other worker placement games, as long as you place workers in the farming/gathering tile the resource for feeding your people is unlimited, they can create enough food for themselves. In this game, the cash flow is limited even if you place the worker in the market tile you can only receive money up to the amount that is available in the pool. The only way to increase the money in the pool is when players cannot pay for their worker and sell their property to bring cash flow into the game, otherwise, there is no way to add more money. At the end of the game, the sum total of the selling prices of all the assets is the victory point.<br/><br/>in this game, If you want to increase population, you can increase it as you like, but unlike other games, population will not score at all except for the effects of some buildings. On the contrary, if the workers cannot produce they will become a huge burden and consume the economy, making accumulation of wealth absolutely impossible.<br/><br/>Essentially, this players have to learn to balance between development of population and the economy. Too few people can not maximize profits. However, if there are too many people they will eat up the profit. Initially, increased workers to increase productivity seems to be very attractive, but when the workers begin to be a burden in the latter half of the game. there is no way to reduce the workers. There is no family planning nor natural disasters, major famine, massacre and cultural revolution in this game. Once the population have increased and if the economic development does not catch up, you will quickly understand what it means to be debt.<br/><br/>"}, "219123": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Fortress of Iron Heart", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3374449.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3374449_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>This small fortress was originally a monastery for warrior-monks of the Forgefather.
