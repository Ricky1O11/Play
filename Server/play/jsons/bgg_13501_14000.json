Curiously the world is smaller than you might think because in the eyes of a magician the world consists only of magical power lines and power fields, specifically four power lines: earth, fire, air and water. Wherever these lines enfold the space, the power fields are created; wherever the lines cross each other, the corners of these fields materialize. (In game terms, four colored strings &mdash; each tied to a ring &mdash; are placed on the table overlapping one another at the start of the game.) The magicians summon ghosts and demons to rule the world &mdash; but at the start of it all nobody knows which type of creature will be the strongest:<br/><br/>     Ghosts &ndash; white creatures &ndash; appear in the center of a power field, and wherever they are summoned, everything freezes in terror. Neither ghosts nor demons may appear in a power field once a ghost has been summoned there.<br/>     Demons &ndash; in the colors of the power lines &ndash; appear in the corners of the power fields adjacent to the lines of their color. No demon will enter a field where a ghost was summoned.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Each magician summons again and again one of the four creatures at a place of his choice, thus filling the world with ghosts and demons. (Ghosts and demons are wooden pawns drawn from a cloth bag.) As soon as no more creature can be summoned, the fate of the world is decided &ndash; and one of the colors will be the strongest. Only once during the game can each magician predict a color, whether one of the demon colors or ghostly white, and each magician must predict a different color. (A player predicts a color by placing a pawn of the color in front of him.) This look into the future costs a lot of energy, and as soon as someone predicts a color, he will be harassed by fate and the other magicians. Thus, which color to predict is an important decision as well as when to predict it.<br/><br/>The magician who predicted the color which is the the strongest in the end rules the world.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["German first edition", "German second edition (300 copies)"], "name": "Dicke D\u00e4monen", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Enclosure", "Betting/Wagering", "Modular Board"], "average": "6.528", "usersrated": "100", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Ghosts"]}, "13504": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Battle of the Dinosaurs", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1993", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["3D Games", "Animals: Dinosaurs"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1065322_t.png", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Golden", "Western Publishing Company"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1065322.png", "boardgameversion": ["Golden Edition 1993"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Children's Game", "Prehistoric"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "This is a simple childrens track game with a 3-D cliff inserted into the board.

That's annoying because the effort was wasted, and it means that there will never be any gold in that region.<br/><br/>But gold isn't the only thing that matters in life!

Play it once and you've learned it, but it takes memory, luck and cunning to become a really great player. The unique assembly of the playing area and rigid storage box will allow you to play on a full size board, yet when packed away the game is so compact you can take it, or store it, almost anywhere. It is ideal for use in the home, on boats and in caravans. Games are only available direct from the manufacturer and can be ordered by credit card on the secure Internet site or by Fax, Phone and Post.<br/><br/>Crusade had been in development for over 10 years before it was put into production, during that period it was extensively tested and refined, into what we believe is now the most exciting 2-player board game ever. It really is the most addictive game you will ever play, the logo 'never just a game' says it all, we've not met anyone yet who has just played one game and put it back in it's box!<br/><br/>The concept was to create a brand new game that had a timeless theme, a game that could stand the test of time in the same manner as Chess and Checkers (Draughts) this would mean the game could not be linked to any film or television characters as they could only date the game to their own popularity. The game would be designed to be user friendly and instantly familiar, as soon as the first game had been played the contestants should feel as though they have been able to play it all their lives. But in order to keep the players interest, the more times the game would be played the greater the thought would need to go into each move. There should be no complicated rules, the game should flow naturally requiring variations in strategy through a series of constant decisions presented by multiple choices and allow for changes in tactics and objectives as various options and opportunities arose.<br/>The playing arena had to be unique, it was required to be robust but light and of a sufficiently large size to make it have a real presence when in use, yet when dismantled the board needed to be compact and take up as little storage space as possible. The board would also to be designed with the facility of integrating a personalized advertising panel allowing corporate customers to promote their company along side the playing area.<br/>The playing pieces would need to be clearly distinguishable and easy to use as this game would not only be played by adults but also by the young and the elderly.<br/>The traditional problem of explaining rules and strategies to new player would be overcome by including in each game box, in addition to the standard explanation leaflet, an audio-tape of not longer than 10 minutes per side that would explain every aspect of the game and allow instant play.<br/><br/>In the beginning.<br/>We started by examining existing board games and listed their strengths and weaknesses. Probably the most universally well-known board game is Chess; it's been around for over 2000 years so it's certainly stood the test of time. However, great game though it undoubtedly is, it does have basic weaknesses; it's difficult to learn to play well, and a player needs an opponent who is on the same level in order to produce a good contest, a novice or a grand master will provide little entertainment to an average player. Another major factor is, it's enough to give you a headache trying to think all those moves ahead, we wanted a game where you could laugh and joke while you played, our game had to be fun, serious fun. We wanted certain elements of Chess but without the complexity and the seriousness. We accepted that one of the great strengths of Chess was that it allowed for changes in strategy throughout the game and although the game could get very involved, there were actually very few rules. Once you knew how the pieces moved and their relative values that was enough to get you started. Another great strength was the layout of the playing area, very simple and mathematically perfect.<br/>The next choice was to choose what would be the driving force of the game, what made the pieces move. Many traditional board games use dice to determine the moves, well that again we saw that as a weakness, luck plays a very big part in dice games, meaning there is very little skill involved in relation to chance. We decided that a standard pack of playing cards would determine which playing piece moved in Crusade they would give infinitely more permutations to their order of play than dice, as well as the fact that a pack of playing cards is familiar to everyone.<br/><br/>Armed with this basic criteria for a new game we stripped out all the other aspects linked with existing board games that we considered not acceptable so:<br/><br/>Out went the boring type of game that seems to go on for days, but you can tell who's going to win after the first half hour.<br/>Excitement is built in to Crusade, it's a quick, yet thought provoking game. Each game will last on average about 15-20 minutes and you'll need memory, luck and cunning in order to become a great player.<br/><br/>Out went the endless pages of rules; so complicated and ambiguous that you spent more time reading them than playing the game and the difficulties of explaining to new players what a game is all about is also resolved.<br/>Crusade has very few rules; it's based more on an understanding of the playing pieces objectives and how they move around the board. Play it once and you've learned it, perhaps the strangest thing is, in no time at all, you'll feel you've played it all your life. To help you learn to play in minutes and to explain the game to new players, each game comes complete with a short audio-cassette. Side 1 explains how to set out the pieces, how they move and why, and how to play the game. Side 2 provides hints on strategies and details a full demonstration game.<br/><br/>Out went the old fashioned cardboard playing area with the unsightly crease down the center, that folded away into a weird long flat box, which you couldn't seem to store anywhere.<br/>Crusade has a sturdy four piece high quality molded game-board that twists together in seconds to produce a full size playing arena, yet when dismantled it packs away into a specially designed box that gives maximum protection with compact storage. Approximate dimensions in mm. 316L x 162W x 60D (like a shoe box but about half as deep) with a weight of less than 1 kilogram. This makes Crusade not only a fantastic game to keep at home but also the ideal game for use in boats and caravans, where space is at a premium.<br/><br/>Out went the problem of finding a group of people to play with you.<br/>Crusade has been designed to be a 2-player game, because it's far easier to find one person to play with rather than getting together the 4 or 6 people required for some types of board games. Opponents can also be drawn from a vast age range. We recommend it is suitable from 8 years old to Adult, however many below 8 years old can pick up the idea of the game within minutes, as have the many people in their 80's who now enjoy playing. There's a simple handicapping system that allows an expert to have an interesting and exciting game with a complete novice, but nobody stays a novice for long. Even playing with people who do not speak your language is not a barrier; the game becomes self-explanatory by just watching it being played. You will become familiar with Crusade quite literally within minutes, you can play time and time again but you'll never play the same game twice. Each game is a new challenge and throughout the game, even if at times your position doesn't look strong, you still have a chance of winning right up to the very end. It's totally absorbing and never over until the last card is played.<br/><br/>"}, "13520": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic54900.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Monte Mattson", "Dennis A.

Certain areas are also spawn points of police and military forces, that randomly enter the fight against the monster as reinforcements each turn. There are also civilian counters, i.e. monster food.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is, for the monster player, to destroy a certain well-known landmark in Stockholm, including the old Tax ministry headquarters, the &quot;degenerate&quot; statue group Paradiset, the Royal castle et al. Before the game starts, the monster players chooses from a set of monster statistics that include which landmark it is to destroy, and also determines the monster start area. The objective of the human player is simply to kill the monster.<br/><br/>Rules chrome includes the then renowned skinhead gangs of Stockholm that in the game are portrayed as violent, unkillable, and anarchist -- they randomly change allegiance each turn -- as well as the ceremonial palace guard, H&ouml;gvakten, at Stockholm Castle.<br/><br/><br/>Introduction from the rules<br/><br/><br/>The following is a translation of the Swedish introduction from the rules:<br/><br/>The Monster that devoured Stockholm is an exciting adventure game where tactics and good foresight are of great importance.<br/><br/>The game is played by two players.

The next player must either play a card from the same Patrol whose number is 1 greater or 1 less than the card on the table, or play a card from a different Patrol whose number is the same.

The lead card designates the number that all other patrols must start on (in this example number 4). If a player has no legal play he must pass. The first player to play his last card scores points equal to the numbers on all the cards still in the other players hands. A Patrol Leader card counts as 15 points for scoring. The first player to score 250 points wins.<br/><br/>According to the Dutch rules from publisher Goliath Games, the number of Patrols used in a game is equal to the number of players (e.g. only use 3 Patrols in a three player game).<br/><br/>"}, "13536": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Assumption", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "1984", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic144214_t.jpg", "average": "6.2", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["K & K International"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic144214.jpg", "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Played in rounds, the winner is the player with the lowest score after 5 rounds of play.

B. Ives of Salem, Massachusetts and went on sale that date. In the May 1843 Boys and Girls magazine, the components of the first edition were described: a gold embossed thumb-hole cloth (maroon) case with printed instructions card (yellow) and four sets of 5 cards, each set outlined in a different color: brown for the Busby family, red for the Doll (the dairymaid) family, yellow for the Ninny-come-twitch family, and blue for the Gardner's family.<br/><br/>S(tephen). B. Ives continued to hold the Ives' games copyrights after he and his brother William dissolved the business in April, 1854 (as mentioned in William's newspaer, The Salem Observer).<br/><br/>Stephen's son, Henry P. Ives partnered with A. Augustus Smith to take over the business until Henry bought Smith out in 1861 according to the 1861 Salem directory.<br/><br/>Stephen, his son Henry, and elder son David (with a dry goods business in Boston) continued to publish the game until 1887 when the last remaining Ives' family member, Henry, sold the copyrights to George S. Parker.<br/><br/>During the interimum, editions were printed by the Ives' family with Milton Bradley labels, Henry P. Ives and Selchow &amp; Righter labels, S. B. Ives and E. G. Selchow labels, and S. B. Ives and E. G. Selchow and E. I. Horseman labels.<br/><br/>According to a letter many publishers were associated with Dr. Busby until 1886 but they really were purchasing and reselling Ives' published games.<br/><br/>In the 1890's McLoughlin Brothers ignored the copyright and put out there own version as did many other major American game manufacturers. That is why you see so many publishers of Dr. Busby in the 1890s.<br/><br/>George S(winterton) Parker made grandiose claims about the games he published which lead to a number of mistakes by historians who failed to go back to the primary sources when describing the history of Dr. Busby.<br/><br/>Consequently,  sParker Brothers rulebook...<br/><br/>&quot;This game was the first ever published in America, being brought out of Salem in 1840.&quot;<br/><br/>Anne Wales Abbot may have first made a prototype of Dr. Busby in 1840 but there are no primary sources to prove this is the case. It may be because the first edition that was published by W. &amp; S. B. Ives is called The Improved and Illustrated Game Of Dr. Busby. Before that published edition with an 1843 copyright, no other earlier editions have been found with or without a copyright date.<br/><br/>George S. Parker, in his 1895 edition of the board game, The Mansion Of Hapiness, made another incorrect claim. The game box cover states that The Mansion Of Happiness was the first board game published in America. There are at least three copies of F. &amp; R. Lockwood's The Travellers' Tour Through The United States (copyright 1882) and one copy of F. &amp;. R. Lockwood's The Travellers' Tour Through Europe in private and museum collections. So Parker was wrong in this claim too.<br/><br/>RULES:<br/>The game consists of 20 cards, divided into 4 families: the Busby Family, the Dairymaid's Family, the Ninnycometwitch Family, and the Gardener's Family. Each family has 5 members, for example the Busby Family consists of Dr. Busby, his Wife, Son, Servant and Dairymaid's black-eyed Lover.<br/><br/>The starting player begins by asking the player on his right for any card not in his own hand. If that player has the card he calls for, he gives it to him and the starting player may call for another card and so on until he calls for a card which the player doesn't have. Then the next player takes his turn, but must first call for those cards which have been called for and obtained by the first player. Thus it becomes a game of memory since any incorrect call ends a turn. When a player has called every card from the player on the right (thus putting that player out of the game), he may continue to call from the next player on the right. At the end of the game, the winner will have successfully called all the cards into his own hand.<br/><br/>"}, "13572": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Frank F.

It is based in feudal Japan with Samurai of various clans fighting to support their lord's quest to become Emperor. There are also shugenja (mages), Dragons, Naga, and hordes of evil demons (Oni). You get a certain number of points to build an army, and armies must typically have units that are either from the same clan or unaligned. You can be units from other clans, but they cost a premium (usually 20% above list price).  Typically, personalities lead units, which is some number of basic troops (usually samurai). A good personality can cost as much as 30 or 40 basic troops, but most cost around 10 times more. Leaders, and occasionally units, have skills. Skills are used to modify initiatives, absorb damage, boost morale, and the like. Many personalities (and some units) also have skills that are unique to that personality / unit.<br/><br/>In addition to the units, each player also has a customized deck of thirty cards.

Each suit represents a different political point of view and poker term: the Hearts are the Pro-Kerry Boston Studs, the Diamonds the pro-Bush Texas Hold&rsquo;ems, the Clubs the Anti-Kerry Flip Floppers, and the Spades are the Anti-Bush Dummy Hands.<br/><br/>Can used to play any standard playing card game and is intended to provide as much value for the comedic commentary and art as the game play.

As with the original design, CoG II contains two separate games (both using the same basic system) covering two of the most interesting (and least-gamed) campaigns of the First World War, Galicia and First Ypres .<br/><br/> Galicia 1914  pitted the armies of Tsarist Russia and Habsburg Austria-Hungary in a ferocious struggle along a 200 mile front. The Austrian commander, General Conrad, refused to wait for the arrival of his 2nd Army, which had been initially deployed to the Serbian front, before going onto the offensive. The Austrian attack began on 19 August, with Conrad's 1st and 4th Armies on the Austrian left flank striking the Russian 4th and 5th Armies on the Tsarist right. The Austrians outnumbered the Russians on this flank, and initially drove them back, and Conrad began to dream of pocketing the entire Russian army group. But the absence of the Austrian 2nd Army gave the Russians an even greater numerical advantage on the opposite flank, as two Russian armies (the 3rd and 8th) struck the Austrian 3rd east of Lemberg (Lvov). Soon it was Conrad's armies that were in danger of being cut off and destroyed. The campaign was a catastrophe for Austria-Hungary, but in the end the result was a fatally incomplete victory for the Russians.<br/><br/>The  First Ypres  game is the first game to cover the climax of the &quot;Race to the Sea&quot; on the Western Front that followed the inconclusive Allied victory at the Marne. By 8 October the continued outflanking attempts by both sides had nearly reached the English Channel. A massive meeting engagement developed, with the Germans first attempting to launch a massive cavalry raid around the Allied northern flank in the direction of Abbeville. When this fizzled (due to the timely arrival of a French infantry corps), the French and British began their own offensive aimed at driving all the way to the German border. But the Allied attack quickly ran into German troops of the 6th Army, hurried north from Alsace-Lorraine. Falkenhayn, the German commander, now planned to play his trump card, striking the BEF with four newly-raised reserve corps of hurriedly-trained but enthusiastic volunteers. In a month of brutal struggle in which the British lost 60,000 men, the Germans lost well over 100,000. Not realizing that the BEF had been bled white and was on the point of breaking, Falkenhayn called off his attacks in mid-November.

Players represent one city colour &amp; have a set of tiles in 3 shapes in your colour and a set of cards for each city plus 4 action cards. You play a card and place a tile either from your set or from the church or neutral sets. The starting player also first draws a card from a central deck which effectively gives them an extra move. Tiles of the same colour cannot touch and the church tiles allow cities to expand.<br/><br/>When a city is completed, it is scored. The colour with the most tiles gets the 1st score, the second colour gets half that, the next gets 4 points and the fourth colour gets 2 pts. Therefore it is possible for the neutral colour to score more points than players. The score is a total of the tiles in the city, plus one for each church, plus one for each cathedral place.<br/><br/>The action cards let you pick up your discards, place a tile to be fixed later, and go first twice (which are discarded). The draw deck cards can be held to score extra points at the end.<br/><br/>At first the game seems pedestrian, but within a few turns the possibilities become more obvious. Judicious use of the pick-up and turn order cards make a big difference. Not spreading too widely and using the neutral tiles to devalue other cities also matters.<br/><br/>An interesting placement game that the designer Wolfgang Panning took 2 1/2 years to complete.

Simple enough for beginners, the game system also has subtle depths that will provide a satisfying challenge for the experienced player.<br/><br/>The VOID rulebook contains all the rules of play, an armory section and army lists for the four human armies: Viridians, Junkers, Syntha and VASA, as well as the mysterious alien race, the Koralon.<br/><br/>A miniature line covering all five armies supports VOID.

The Hungarians numbered around 35,000 (including artillerist), the Ottomans, about 60,000. While there is much disagreement about numbers at this battle, all sources agree that the Ottomans did outnumber the Hungarians significantly. The Hungarian front line was stretched rather thinly to match, or attempt to match, the frontage that would be presented by the Ottomans. The Hungarians had, as was the practice for the last 200 years in European warfare, dug a trench in front of their front line infantry and artillery to give them a defense advantage. The actual battle, which started at around 3:00 PM, lasted but a few hours, maybe less.<br/><br/>Each combat unit represents about 750 men. The map scale is about 225 yards per hex and depicts the flat and, because of the proximity of the oft-overflowing Danube, somewhat soft and, in many places, slippery battlefield at Mohacs.<br/><br/>Suleiman the Magnificent is an accessible, fast-playing, fun game of low complexity.

There have been numerous attempts at this, but very few succeeded(if any), and his 'entry' is a long way towards fulfilling this accomplishment.<br/><br/>What you get are a very large Ziploc Baggie to store it all within; (3)Booklets(designed for 1/285, 1/300, 15mm, or even 20mm); (1&amp;1/2)-Full Color Sheets(providing Terrain Markers, a 'Compass', &amp; 'Firing Arcs' for Guns &amp; Target aspects); a &quot;Combat Results Table&quot; with the &quot;Sequence of Play&quot; on the reverse; a &quot;Terrain Effects Chart&quot; while on it's reverse are the &quot;Range Effects&quot;, &quot;Mine Attacks&quot;, &quot;Command Efficiency&quot; Tables &amp; a &quot;Movement Orders Chart&quot; with a &quot;Scatter Diagram&quot;; a &quot;Unit Roster Sheet&quot; while on it's reverse side is the &quot;Artillery Fire Target Plotting Chart&quot;; there is a sheet of &quot;Unit VALUES Card&quot; while on the reverse of this are markers for &quot;Wrecks&quot;, and small 'S' &amp; 'D' ones; and Players will need to provide at least (1) or more DICE of the '12', '8', &amp; '6'-sided variety, before commencing play. Players are given permission to copy anything pertinent to the gameplay using this 'system', and it is highly suggested for some items.<br/><br/>Of the (3) Booklets included, the 'Minis' one is '28' pages long and details the Rules system; the next one is the &quot;Consolidated Weapons Data&quot; that is '24' pages, along with some 'Supplement' Sheets; and the last one is the &quot;Tables of Organization &amp; Scenario Design&quot; which is '60' pages long. The &quot;Rules&quot; explain what to do during the &quot;Sequence of Play&quot; which is detailed as follows: 1)-Joint Plot Phase; 2)-Initiative Phase; 3)-Posture Determination Phase; 4)-Joint Indirect Phase; 5)-Joint Direct Fire Phase; 6)-Joint Movement Phase; &amp; 7)-Marker Removal Phase. The &quot;Consolidated Weapons Data&quot; Booklet (and 'Supplement' Sheets) provide detailed information for many Nation's weapons and vehicles that are associated with them. There are even individual 'stats' for BOTH of Spain's &quot;Civil War&quot; participants(the Nationalists &amp; Republicans!). The &quot;Table of Organizations and Scenario Design&quot; Booklet gives detailed make-ups of various Nation's Units and even during different periods of the entirety of World War 2!

Rivers and mountains do not hinder movement.  Forest areas take two turns to enter.    French units (ONLY) with supply points may attempt to Force March and move two areas in a turn.  A failed attempt to Force March means the unit does not move at all.  French infantry Force March on a roll (six-sided die) of 1-4.  French Cavalry Force Marches on a roll of 1-5.  Each unit attempting to Force March roll individually.  The Napoleon unit and the French Guards unit may always Force March (no die roll required) if supply is available.<br/><br/>Combat is a two step affair.

A player cannot place a large chip on the outer circle if it is already covered with a chip. The first player to cover 3 numbers across their playing card wins the game and takes all the chips on the board.

In the standard 4-player form of the game, the game has two teams - the fielding team and the batting team. On the fielding team one player takes the role of the bowler while the other takes the fielder role. On the batting team the two players each take the role of the batsmen.  The batting team will have ten overs to score runs, unless the bowling team can take ten wickets first. The team with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>How it works: The game contains three decks of cards; batting, bowling, fielding. Each over, the batter, the bowler and fielder receive a new set of possible deliveries(bowling cards), shot options (batting cards) and field positions (field cards).<br/>The bowler will try to restrict runs, bowl the batter or appeal for LBW. The batter will try to smash a six.

From 1741 to 1748, the War of the Austrian Succession raged on the continent of Europe. From 1743 on, Britain and France were formally at war. In late August of 1745, Charles Edward Stuart, better known as Bonnie Prince Charlie, landed at Loch nam Uamh with seven men, raised the Standard of the outcast Stuart kings at Glenfinnan, and gathered to himself an army to challenge the might of King George II's realm. Composed of wild Highlanders, Lowland peasants, discontented gentlemen and diehard Jacobite nobles, the Pretender's army defeated the local garrison forces and laid all Scotland at his feet. A descent on England should now have given the Prince's reluctant French allies the diversion they needed to invade. Marching on London however, the Jacobites lost their nerve after reaching Derby and retreated, pursued now by the best regiments of the British Army. The French, working with information a couple of weeks out of date, were still not ready to aid them.<br/><br/>Confronting each other at the battle of Falkirk in the winter of 1745, neither side appeared to prevail, and both withdrew to lick their wounds. However the tide of war was now firmly against the Jacks, and they withdrew again into the mountain fastnesses of Scotland, hoping to wage a guerrilla war and so encourage the French. The idea proved impractical, especially in mid-winter, and in the wet spring of 1746, the British Army under the Duke of Cumberland met the remaining Jacobite forces under Charlie himself at the battle of Culloden and crushed them. While Scotland suffered the fire and sword of the conqueror, the Prince flitted through the heather, and after many romantic adventures escaped to France, never to return. His allies the French were unconcerned, as the withdrawal of the British Army from Flanders allowed them to seize the vital port of Antwerp and a number of key fortifications necessary for taking the war to the Austrian Netherlands. At war's end, the price for surrendering these gains would be the fortress of Louisburg, Nova Scotia and the temporary restoration of French colonial dominance in North America.<br/><br/>Expanded by: Highland Quorum<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.5", "name": "Charlie's Year", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Point to Point Movement"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["Highland Quorum"], "usersrated": "4", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Age of Kings", "Lace Wars"]}, "13846": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic186491.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Michael Junkin", "Ian Weir"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2004", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Red Sash Games"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic186491_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Age of Reason", "Wargame"], "description": "From the Manufacturer:<br/><br/>Cockpit of Europe (CoE) covers the campaigns of the War of the Austrian Succession in the Flanders theater between 1744 and 1748. From 1741 to 1748, the War of the Austrian Succession raged on the continent of Europe. From 1743 on, Britain and France were formally at war. The French leadership were divided into two schools of thought. The traditionalists believed that the Habsburg dynasty was the primary threat to France's position in Europe, and that the main thrust of the war should be made against their possessions in Italy and Germany. The other school feared the rise of the Maritime Powers (England and Holland) and counseled a hard blow in that direction. CoE looks at the five years that the French spent in the Low Countries attempting to smash the ring of enemies surrounding them.<br/><br/>Even though the French, thanks to the sublime leadership of their German-born Marshal, Maurice de Saxe, conquered Belgium and invaded Holland, defeating every army sent against them, the campaigns resulted in a draw. The subsequent peace merely restored the status quo. The stage was then set for the titanic Seven Years War.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, there is great scope for you as the King's Captain General. The armies involved were the largest yet seen on a European battlefield &amp;#8800; the French fielded over 200,000 men, and the Allies tried their best to match them.

In 1714, Queen Anne, the last of the Stuart monarchs, passed away. Her successor by law was the German George Augustus Welf, Elector of Hanover, who became King George I. But the new regime was far from stable. Only the Whig Party - the forerunners of the Liberals - supported him. He consigned the Tories (the later Conservative Party) to the political wilderness for their part in making peace with France separately from the German states in 1713. The overt supporters of his rival, James Edward Stuart - the Jacobites - were forced to flee or go into hiding.<br/><br/>George took the blame for most of the country's ills following the late War of the Spanish Succession. He relied too much on his Whig friends, which on the one hand gave Parliament more power over royal affairs than ever before, and on the other, encouraged many who would not otherwise have done so to support the Jacobite Cause of restoring the Stuart dynasty. One such man was John Erskine, Earl of Mar, late Secretary of State for Scotland, but now unemployed. Mar belonged to no party (if you except the Earl of Mar's Retirement Assurance Association, which was more of a special interest group) but he was identified with the old Tory regime and had ties to the Scottish Jacobites. He offered his services to George, only to be publicly snubbed. Frustrated, he traveled to Scotland, and began to fan the flames of rebellion.<br/><br/>Scotland had suffered a political union with England in 1707, for which Mar was largely responsible. A persuasive man, he now began to organize a coalition of those opposed to the Union and those opposed to King George. The Loyalists, led by the Whig Duke of Argyle (who had ironically opposed the Union) were alarmed, but the Government took no notice, its members still scrambling for &quot;places&quot; under the new Administration. With the heather aflame, on the 6th of September 1715, the Royal Standard of the Stuarts went up on the Braes of Mar, before a crowd of 600 that would shortly swell to over 12,000.

Carthage concentrates on Punic events that take place in Carthage/Africa as well as Sicily, with the main scenario being the massive First Punic War. Building on the popular mechanics and systems of Rise of the Roman Republic (Vol I), Carthage includes the full, advances naval system, with galley battles, fleet building expanding ports, and everything featured in the unusual, truly naval war that was the First Punic War. In addition, the detailed political systems for both powers, the soul of the game and a set of mechanics that truly puts the players in the heart of ongoing events, are expanded and clarified. With the addition of rules for the Reduction and Repair of city defenses, militia, and the ability of garrisons to Sally, sieges are now more than just sideshows.<br/><br/>Carthage still uses The Ancient World's unique combat system, with its unusual Unpredictable Results, elephants, cavalry pursuit, and the dangers of fighting too many battles. Carthage's main scenario is, of course, the First Punic War, a twenty year affair that will take some time to play, but keep you entranced for years. The game also includes quick, one evening scenarios, including the playtester two-turn favorite Hiero; Hero or Gyro?, the twisty opening year of the First Punic War. We also have short scenarios for the first invasion of Carthage by Agathocles of Syracuse (311 BC) and the infamous Mercenary War that erupted in Carthage right after the First Punic War (241 BC).<br/><br/>Carthage contains one full-sized map - the slightly redone Italy map (we've expanded rivers to a three-tiered system and corrected some tangential map errata) - plus a half-map for Carthage and Africa. The 1000+ full-color counters include every Roman magistrate of the era plus lots of Libyans, Numidians, Egyptians, Iberians, Celts ... if they were there, they're in this game. Also, part of the game package is a expanded group of play-aid charts, prompted by playtester insistence, to help keep track of the many details that campaigning can require.<br/>Carthage is the Punic War's game that ancients and gaming aficionados have been waiting for since the beginning of the wargame hobby.

Properties are colored in one of four colors which correspond to the &quot;se-va&quot; or money notes.  Instead of purchasing properties landed upon, players instead arbitrarily pick up a note of that property's color when they land there, until one player has ten notes of that color and becomes &quot;owner&quot; of that color so long as they have more than ten notes of that color; when players subsequently land on that color they must pay the player that controls that color three notes of that color.

Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations -- the Greeks, the Cretans, the Egyptians, the Palestinians, and the Macedonians -- and then must use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations.  Periodically, there are expositions at major European cities, and the archaeologist who shows up on time with the best collection of artifacts (plus a minor die roll) wins the purse.  The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and presents the biggest collection to the European exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues.<br/><br/>The key element to the game is that it is played out over a period of two (or three) years, and each action a player performs takes a certain amount of time -- traveling is a week between cities, gathering knowledge takes time for the level of the knowledge, and actually digging at a cultural site takes time to yield a certain number of artifact cards.  The game uses a novel mechanic to keep track of this -- there is a track of 52 spaces around the outside of the board, and each time a player moves and takes an action, he or she moves their player token forward in time.  Players take turns based on being the one who is furthest back in &quot;time&quot;.  So, a player can go to an excavation site and spend 10 weeks digging for artifacts, but that will also mean that the other players will likely be taking several actions in the interim while that player waits for the &quot;time&quot; to catch up.<br/><br/>In addition, the artifact cards in each civilization are a hidden number.  The deck for each civilization contains twelve treasures of varying point values and two knowledge cards, with another sixteen cards of dirt.  At the beginning of the game, seven cards are removed from each deck without the players seeing them.  Through the course of the game, when a player excavates at a site, he or she keeps the artifacts that are revealed from a site, but the dirt is shuffled back into the remaining cards.  Both the imperfect information element as well as the recycled dirt make for a random chance element that is overcome somewhat by digging at a site where a player has much knowledge -- more knowledge means that more cards will be revealed in a shorter period of time, and a greater chance of revealing treasures that may yet remain after another player has already recovered some treasures from that site.<br/><br/>The original run of Jenseits von Theben was hand-produced by Prinz Spiele in a first edition of 100, and a second edition of 300.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Thebes<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["German first edition", "German second edition"], "average": "7.19121", "name": "Jenseits von Theben", "playingtime": "75", "boardgamemechanic": ["Time Track"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "523", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Archaeology"]}, "13884": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic133721.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Outpost"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jens Dr\u00f6gem\u00fcller"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2004", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Andrea Boekhoff"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Lookout Games", "Z-Man Games"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic133721_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Fantasy"], "boardgamehonor": ["2005 Japan Boardgame Prize Best Advanced Game Nominee"], "description": "The Scepter of Zavandor is about magic and power.

The money builds up on the left hand board until someone takes control of that dictator and wins the stash, cash is then paid straight to the player until they lose control. A bit like a tug of war the dictators can pass back and forth several times before someone takes the majority. In the meantime the more you control the more you make! The less you control the more you Pay! Avoiding the pitfalls of the riot police, UN court and assassination attempts players take control of the ten different dictator squares by winning possession or taking them by force through dice rolling. Players have to pay for the weapons of mass destruction they use as they move around the board, unless they own them then the money is theirs. By holding the more high profile dictators in their control, players will begin to make a tidy sum from the other players.

If a number cannot be placed on a stack, it must be placed at the bottom end of one of the 4 columns. It is most desirable to place counters on columns so that the columns are in descending order. The only way to move a counter from a column is to move it onto one of the stacks. Only the counter at the bottom end of a column may be moved. Continue drawing until all counters have been placed.

Players can roll to make 'emergency' changes to their plotted movement (which is restricted, for example a 'right' move can never be changed into a 'left' move.)<br/><br/>Combat occurs at the end of every phase.  Drivers can fire one turret, (a group of weapons mounted in one of eight directions) gunners can fire two.  Any/all weapons can be fired each phase, which makes for a lot of shooting opportunities, which is good since weapons only fire in a straight line (front/back/right/left/diagonals.)<br/><br/>Scenarios include the basic duel, &quot;Rush Hour&quot; where there is a chance for random traffic to enter the highway (is what the on-ramp is used for) and a Death Race with 3 to 5 players racing sets of identical cars.<br/><br/>The game comes in a small box, closed with a folding flap like a satchel, complete with 3 highway boards (so you can put the rear board in front and keep driving) counters for the cars, lots of charts &amp; tables, car control sheets and a rule book.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Threshold First Edition"], "name": "Highway 2000", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Modular Board"], "average": "5.2", "boardgameexpansion": ["The Gauntlet", "Hell on Wheels", "The Road", "Street Fighter", "TurboFire", "Ultraforce"], "usersrated": "5", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "age": "12"}, "13955": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic56643.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Aaron Allston"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1984", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": ["Jean E.

Rock-Paper-Scissors. There are four suits of 12 cards each, numbered 1 -12. The suits are JAN (stone), KEN (scissors), PO (paper) and KAJI (fire). The main version is the 4-player (possible partnership) game, with 2, 3 and 5-player variants.<br/><br/>In the 4-player game, 11 cards are dealt to each player and a 4-card NEKO (kitty) is set aside. There is one round of bidding where each player has one opportunity (in clockwise order) to bid on how many tricks over a book of five she will win. High bidder (Declarer) picks up the kitty, discards 4 cards and then sets trump. Declarer may elect to play the hand alone or chooses a partner by asking for a particular card. Whoever holds that card must show it and becomes the Declarer's partner. The remaining 2 players become partners. Seating order is not changed when the partnerships are formed.<br/><br/>When the KAJI suit is trump, the value of the other suits depends upon the order in which the suits are played and follow the  traditional Rock beats Scissors beats Paper beats Rock order (JAN-KEN-PO). However, if not declared trump, KAJI is always the second ranking suit (ex: if JAN is trump, suit rank is JAN-KAJI-KEN-PO). Only a higher trump card will beat another card in the trump suit.<br/><br/>Declarer leads any suit. Play proceeds clockwise in turns, and players must follow suit if possible. If a player cannot follow suit, she may play any card. If it is a card of lower suit than the previous card, it is regarded as a discard and does not change the current suit. If it is a card of a higher suit, that becomes the current suit. Say Scissors is trump and a Rock card follows a Paper card that is lead. Paper is still the suit to follow or beat. Say Scissors is trump and a Paper card follows a Rock card that is lead. Paper is now the suit ro follow or beat. The winner of each trick leads the next.<br/><br/>When playing in partnership, if the Declarer's partnership achieves or exceeds its bid, each player in the Declarer's partnership scores 5 points for each trick over the book of five that was bid and 10 points per trick over the bid if applicable. If playing alone, Declarer scores 10 points for each trick over the book of five. If Declarer's partnership does not achieve or exceed its bid, each opponent receives 10 points for each trick they fell short. If Declarere is playing alone, opponents receive 20 points for each trick by which the contract failed.<br/><br/>"}, "13976": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic57986.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Mario Papini"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2004", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Andrea Nicolai"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Z-Man Games", "ZuGames"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic57986_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Fighting", "Medieval"], "description": "In Feudo, players move their various units from their castle, around a map, capturing cities and eliminating enemies.

The element of chance means that everyone ultimately has a chance. The game is derived from Chinese philosophy, which says that all things in life must be in balance.

Before the game starts the stones are shuffled and placed on the white triangles on the perimeter with the symbols face down. The numbers in the black triangles remain visible. The color of the pawns is also the color of your starting field. Each player drops the three sticks on each turn. Move the total of the throw (6, 7, 8, or 9) on the main field. The used the philosophy that extremes are changeable. You can make a 6 a 7 and a 9 a 8. There are two rounds. In the first round you collect the stones and in the second round you have to make a line (lifeline) between 2 triangles. Therefore, players may lay a stone on the main field on each turn. Each stone laid down must be able to form a pair. This is an import point. It must be able, nothing more than that. Different pairs may be placed against each other. In this way a lifeline can be formed or stones can be played out. The first player to add his last stone to the lifeline is the winner.<br/>It is a new kind of game. You have to get used to it.

Support units, like artillery, cavalry and tanks, focus their strength more on relative fire power and attack force.

The Russian plan was to subdue the city with a massive show of force to intimidate its populace into submission.
