An unaligned outpost, it&rsquo;s the last space station before the intergalactic hyper-jump spot, leading to a nearly infinite number of worlds. You may wonder if the hyper-jump spot is so amazing why it&rsquo;s on the farthest flung spot in the entire galaxy. That&rsquo;s because not all the neighbors are friendly and not everyone who jumps gets to come home. Developed one hundred and fifty years ago, the hyper-jump spot creates a wormhole that can target other galaxies. With a second hyper-jump spot in place you can jump back and forth with relative safety. There wasn&rsquo;t always a jump network though. It used to be the first jump spot could fling you across the universe and leave you there. That&rsquo;s exactly how the network was built. Brave men and women on ships would make the jump to spots unknown. If they survived, they built new jump spots that let them come home. If a ship couldn&rsquo;t return, most assumed the destination was too dangerous and didn&rsquo;t jump there again.<br/><br/>We get all types here: Local business folks who make the station their home. Alliance officers on shore leave before making the jump, Smugglers, Thieves, and Pirates mingling with Con Men and Mercenaries in the stations Shops, Clubs, Bars and Casino. All under the ever watchful eye of the Ministry of Light, and station security of course.<br/><br/>There is always something new and exciting to see, but unfortunately, it might just be the last thing you see.<br/><br/>"}, "167025": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2259766.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Dan Hundycz"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Courtney Boulton"], "boardgamepublisher": ["DPH Games Inc"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2259766_t.png", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game"], "description": "You battle villains to protect the geocaches that Dr. Apephace so desperately wants to destroy.

The app can record the distance, time, pace, and calories burned on each mission through the use of the phone's GPS or accelerometer. When using the GPS feature, the user can also opt to participate in a zombie chase which requires the player to run faster for a short period of time or be caught by zombies and lose their supplies, or even fail the mission.

Fight at the edge of space against an array of creative horrors including cybernetically-enhanced laser space sharks or artillery-toting polar bears - and those are not even the strangest monstrosities to encounter!<br/><br/>You must terraform the entire world, craft armor, weapons, kits, and vehicles to help you explore and conquer. Starting only with a laser pick and the gear from your pod you must immediately start gathering resources to survive. At the absolute edge of space you will adapt or die! Good luck ArkCo Operative!<br/>What is the story?<br/>The story centers around you, as an ArkCo recruit. As one of the few, proud, and lucky men and women of ArkCo, you must go where no one has wanted to go or was technically meant to go. After an indeterminate time in cryo-sleep, you awake to find yourself in a lonely, Bermuda Triangle-like area in the depths of space. There is no way back, you are on your own, and you must fight to survive. Your only hope lies in your knowledge of ArkCo's incredible technologies. Now you must find the materials to produce them in your deadly new home. Can you find what it takes to thrive in the depths of space?<br/>What about the gameplay? How is it different?<br/>Edge of Space features some of things you would expect from a 2d sandbox but then expands in those concepts. In Edge of Space, the very environment is aware of your presence, and will work AGAINST you. The world is immersed in various deadly exposures, further challenging you as you attempt to explore and tame the environment. You must create a breathable atmosphere, capable of sustaining life. Should you cease to maintain that atmosphere, the world will overtake your base, and revert to its original deadly state. Features such as gas simulation, streamlined power grid system, co-op weapons, non-linear advancement system, reactive environment, global goals, and a unique crafting system all enhance the experience. The player vs. environment feel brings different spin to the genre, pitting the player against far more than just mobs. You will be constantly challenged to terraform bigger and bigger portions of the world to keep your hold on it, and ultimately to conquer it all.<br/>Edge of Space Combat: More than just point-and-shoot!<br/>The Edge of Space Combat experience will also bring a more intense action feel to the game. One weapon will NOT save you! Enemies will display a wide variety of attack patterns and methods. The player will have to learn the enemies movements and learn to compensate in order to defeat them. Some may explode on impact, some may launch projectiles, while others may just directly strike the player. Still others may require the player to take to the air, being able to time jet-pack bursts to dodge enemy attacks and to launch your own offensive. Knowing your enemy will be crucial to survival in Edge of Space. To add even more immersion to the survival aspect, players will be confronted with world events and with enemies that become aware that you are there. These types of AI will actually SEEK YOU OUT, once you have come close enough to trigger their awareness. Should you not defeat them, they will from that point, seek your base and attempt to destroy you!<br/>Key Features:<br/>Open World &ndash; Dynamically-generated 2D sandbox set in the deepest recesses of space.<br/>Insane Creatures &ndash; Hordes of enemies and epic bosses ranging from Artillabears, squid pandas, jetpack space penguins, and laser space sharks.<br/>Cooperative Exploration &ndash; Engrossing gameplay, built from the ground up, to support multiplayer focusing on cooperative exploration and combat with team-based tactics.<br/>Command Center Management &ndash; Establish your central base of operation by creating the ultimate Command Center customized with defensive turrets, hangers and repair drones.<br/>PIOS (Power Input Output Systems) &ndash; A simple drag and drop tool, letting you design electrical systems as basic as powering a light or as complex as creating your own logic gates.<br/>Deep Exploration &ndash; Master the navigation of extraterrestrial hideaways and randomly generated caverns.

What are you waiting for?<br/><br/>Airships of Oberon is a fun, highly social strategy game in which players compete to capture Artifacts and complete missions. It's great for both casual and experienced gamers.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to complete a series of Missions in which you capture 1 to 4 Flux Artifacts and deliver them to a location on the board. You receive Experience points (XP) for each Artifact you capture and for completing a Mission. When you have earned 36 XP, you become a Flux Master. Then you can complete your final Mission: capture the three keys and go to Oberon City at the center of the board to win the game.<br/><br/>Often players will need the same Artifacts and they will have to chase each other around to capture the Artifacts they need. Players also have twelve Anti-Magnetic Effects that they can use during the game to help themselves and slow down other players. Two of the Effects are unique for each player. During your turn you have the freedom to move via trains or airships, use Anti-Magnetic Effects and take other actions in any order.<br/><br/>There is a lot of fun drama and reversals of fortune in this game. The end-game is quite exciting when you become a Flux-Master and start your final Mission to capture the three keys. Other players will try to stop you using their Anti-magnetic effects, meanwhile other players are becoming Flux Masters and trying to take your keys from you.<br/><br/>Detailed Story Summary<br/><br/>The Divergence: In 1895 a disastrous fire raged through the laboratory of the brilliant inventor Nikola Tesla at 35 South Fifth Avenue, NY, destroying most of his important research papers. One of his business consultants, Charles Oberon, managed to salvage Tesla's documents on wireless power generation. He secretly took these documents back to his home in Denver, and with funding from the Oberon Land Company, patented Tesla's inventions and built the first wireless transmission towers. Using wireless power, airships and trains could now travel lighter without the need for an on-board engine or fuel. Over several years Oberon created a network of airship corridors and super-light rocket-rail trains across the Midwest, all using his wireless transmission towers, competing with and rivaling the railroad dynasties.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Tesla, nearly bankrupt, turned to another neglected research project - Anti-Magnetism. Tesla soon discovered that Anti-Magnetic Flux had elemental Effects that could be used to manipulate matter and perception. He developed various apparatus to harness these Effects: Ocular Attenuators, Anti-Magnetic Shields, Induction-Ray Guns and Temporal Distortion Devices. But having become disillusioned by the patent system, he instead made his technology freely available to a core group of inventors and enthusiasts who soon formed the Anti-Magnetic League. The most skilled practitioners became known as Flux Masters, who spread the knowledge to others and taught the novices in the craft.<br/><br/>Forty years after the Divergence, Oberon City (formerly Denver) had become the most powerful city on the continent and airships traveled across the world. The Anti-Magnetic League, still essentially an underground movement, now had more than a hundred Anti-Magnetic Flux Nodes to power its apparatus. The Flux nodes drew power from Oberon's transmission towers using a &quot;Freedom of the Airwaves&quot; clause in Federal law.<br/><br/>When Oberon realized the massive amount of power that was being siphoned off his network, he sought to shut down the Anti-Magnetic League. Using a combination of legal action, lobbying and propaganda campaigns, he had the Flux Masters and their supporters arrested, and the Flux Nodes dismantled. Most importantly, the League's Codex of research was confiscated and locked up in a secure facility in Oberon City, protected by an electric holo-field.<br/><br/>This was a crushing blow to The Anti-Magnetic League. However, twelve Flux nodes still remained, having been built as backups and cleverly hidden for just such a crisis. And though the Flux Masters had been arrested, other members of the League were still free.<br/><br/>This is where the game begins. The League's Shadow Council believes that only a Flux Master can decode the holo-field and capture the Codex without being detected. So they have set up a competition for all League members: the first member who can become a Flux Master and capture the Codex will be appointed as leader of the League (known as the League Architect) for one year.<br/><br/>The players are members of the Anti-Magnetic League who are competing to rescue the Codex.<br/><br/>Your goal is to go on a series of important missions for the Anti-Magnetic League, capturing Flux Artifacts from the remaining Flux Nodes to help you complete your missions. This will allow you to develop your skill in manipulating Anti-magnetic Flux power. Once you have earned 36 experience points, you will become a Flux Master.

Their programs suffered from uninspired writing and terrible acting, they cranked out underfunded and unoriginal monster-of-the-week movies, and an unwise investment in obtaining the television rights to amateur boxing nearly forced them into bankruptcy.<br/><br/>Two seasons ago, a new show debuted on SkyFy that changed everything: Spirit Seekers. Part myth investigation, part ghost hunting, and all sensationalized reality show, the hosts and crew of Spirit Seekers explored abandoned buildings and gutted houses, recorded highly unlikely evidence of supernatural encounters, and featured B-list guest celebrities who were more embarrassing than entertaining.<br/><br/>And the audience loved it. The ratings for the fist season went through the roof, beating out many popular prime-time shows on better cable channels. With advertisers signing on in droves, the second season was moved to compete directly with heavyweights like Myth Hunters and American Idol. Again, their ratings skyrocketed, with specials filmed in an old insane asylum, a neglected naval base, and even a former WWII internment camp.<br/><br/>Now, as they plan their third season, the writers have proposed a special two-hour episode. Fans had been writing in on the Spirit Seekers blog and FaceSpace page about rumors from New South Wales, Australia. Apparently four or fie years ago a<br/>Japanese television crew for a similar, occult-themed program &ndash; Naruhodo Noroi &ndash; went missing while filming in a derelict mining camp called Opal Ditch. The locals reported that they had vanished into the Dreamlands.<br/><br/>Of course, to the SkyFy program executives, this sounded like a bunch of nonsense. However, fact-checkers soon uncovered that a Japanese TV crew did in fact go missing there, and only one of the crew had been found with amnesia nine months later in a rain-gorged creek nearly six kilometers south of the camp. This caught the attention of Spirit Seekers'' producer, and, after securing a financial partnership with the CEO of Saxxon Petroleum, got the green light for the Season Three Premiere.<br/>With contracts signed and immunizations updated, the cast and crew get ready to board their flight to a small town called Lightning Ridge.<br/><br/>"}, "167183": {"rpgdesigner": ["Mike Wight"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Dark Times", "rpgartist": ["Mike Wight"], "rpgproducer": ["Mike Wight"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2261095.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Star Wars"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Cthulhu Dark"], "rpgpublisher": ["Gremlin Legions"], "rpgcategory": ["Alternate Rules (Variant Core Rules)"], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Space Opera)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2261095_t.png", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>The Old Republic has fallen, and now the remaining Jedi are fugitives, running for their very lives from the evil Emperor Palpatine and the traitorous Darth Vader.

It now play 1-4 players and consists of numerous Heroes and Henchmen to choose from to delve in the dungeon below. Here are some game highlights.<br/><br/>1)Bluffing and Blind Bidding. Players are attempting to destroy the nasty creatures below in the dungeon to gain fame by playing cards face down and revealing simultaneously. Each enemy has a set number of hit points based on the number of players. There are three enemies to deal with in each level of the dungeon, so strategy, tactics, and bluffing are a must. There is also two rounds of bidding so players gain insight into what other players are up to.<br/><br/>2)Deck Building. When a player defeats an enemy, that card is rotated 180 degrees and then added to the player's discard pile. The bottom of each monster card indicates what item the enemy is carrying. These items add power to your character in future rounds, and act as an organic and thematic way to show that your characters are advancing.<br/><br/>3)Draft Your Unique Party. Before play begins, players complete a draft in order to create their starting hand of twelve cards. Each player gets one Hero and one Henchman. All characters are very unique and play quite differently from one another. This sets the bar high for replay value!<br/><br/>4)No Down Time! Since all play is done simultaneously, no players are ever waiting on others for very long.

Drew uses over 1,000 frames of animation to achieve her presence from multiple angles. Only possible using modern hardware requirements, this method inspired from older pseudo-3D games is updated for the current generation, and allows artists to make virtually any game, any genre, with hand-drawn art. Since it is achieved with individual images, this method can bring traditional, stop-motion, Claymation, live-action, and other animation styles in 3D games in a way never seen before.<br/>     What if you played a platformer where the level was invisible? Simplistic yet full of potential, levels will use a variety of visual clues to help the player find their way to the end of each environment, requiring you to look before you leap, and be constantly wary if where to go next.

Those antipodists who scoff at such balancing acts can act contrary to their colleagues (thus becoming antipodists for a totally different reason!) and choose to throw their lot in with light or darkness, to the exclusion of the other side of the coin, thus ensuring that all of her power is concentrated in a single pool.<br/><br/>Designed to be a fun and fairly simple spellcasting experience, perfect for first-time spellcasters, but refreshingly different for veterans, the antipodist's design is predicated on fun combos, the ability to create wildly different characters based on limited spell selection, and some of the most wickedly difficult advancement decisions ever found in an Interjection Games product. Though no single advancement choice will cripple a character, every choice is tracked by the class itself, spitting out different opportunities and passive bonuses based on the road the antipodist has chosen to take.

It is the fourth installment in the Skylanders video game franchise and is scheduled for release on October 5, 2014 in North America, October 2, 2014 in Australasia, and October 10, 2014 in Europe, for release on Android, Fire OS and iOS mobile platforms, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Wii, Wii U, Xbox 360 and Xbox One video game consoles and the Nintendo 3DS handheld gaming device.<br/><br/>Skylanders: Trap Team utilizes a near-field communication reader platform, called the Traptanium Portal, that reads NFC chips located on the bottom of figurines. The figurines are then used in-game as playable characters. A new line of figurines, named &quot;Trap Masters&quot;, have been announced. The Trap Masters, working with the Portal Master, must try to capture all criminals that Kaos has released from prison.<br/><br/>After the events in the previous game, Skylanders: Swap Force, Kaos, the primary antagonist, releases the worst villains in Skylands, the game's setting, by blowing up Cloudcracker Prison, where they were all imprisoned. This sends all of the Trap Master Skylanders and the Traptanium used to build the prison to Earth. The player, in the role of Portal Master, must use the Trap Masters and the Traptanium shards, now in the form of traps, to capture all of the escaped villains.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>As in previous games, the player controls a variety of characters by placing toy figures representing the characters onto an near field communication-enabled interface device known as the Traptanium Portal, which activates the character in the game. In Trap Team, however, a new item type has been added: the trap. Unlike the figures, which brings characters into the game, the traps can be used to store forty-seven enemy characters originally found in the game,(including Kaos apparently) who may then be controlled as good characters. These stored characters can be taken to other consoles. The Traptanium Portal has a speaker incorporated in its design, to emphasize the trapping mechanic. When enemies are &quot;trapped&quot;, their vocals travel from a screen to the portal. Skystones Smash, a mini-game and successor to Skystones from Skylanders: Giants. Skystones Smash is a card game, that using numbers and is played in a tabletop style is also included in the game.<br/><br/>Trap Masters are introduced in Trap Team and are special Skylanders that are stronger against trappable villains. The game also establishes Skylanders Minis (miniature versions of regular Skylanders) as playable characters. Players can switch between playing as a villain and a Skylander at any point in the game. In co-operative play players can share the trapped villain, and take turns playing as it. However, a time limit is given to how long a villain can be used. Once the playable villain's energy is depleted, players must wait until the villain's energy can recharge before using the character once more. Villains are actually more powerful than Skylanders. There are also hidden quests involving villains, once completed each quest unlocks exclusive upgrades. Villains can also be stored in the Villain Vault which is located in the game's hub world.<br/><br/>The mobile version of Trap Team uses a bluetooth Traptanium Portal and optional touch controls. If the Traptanium Portal is not connected, players can use &quot;on the go characters,&quot; digital versions of the figurines stored on the device.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Skylanders: Trap Team&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "167235": {"poll": [], "name": "Crunch Time!", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android edition", "iPad/iPhone edition", "Linux Downloadable edition", "Macintosh Downloadable edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Comedy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Other"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone", "Linux", "Macintosh", "Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "description": "Crunch Time! is a card game with a touch of humour, based on videogame development, in which you'll have to manage your own company, and complete the best and biggest projects before your opponent.<br/> Cards will help you on your way: developers of all departments, positive cards to help you work faster; errors and problems to slow your opponent down; and much more which you'll discover as you play<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "167236": {"poll": [], "name": "Picross e4", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Nintendo 3DS eShop edition"], "average": "6.5", "videogameseries": ["Picross e"], "videogametheme": ["Puzzle"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["Jupiter Corporation"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo 3DS"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Jupiter Corporation"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Picross e4 is the forth game in the Picross e series of nonogram puzzles for the Nintendo 3DS.

The player with more control over a region's population gains control of that power's government and decides what the it will do. As control of a government can change with each new surge of controlled population, players may be able to manipulate several governments at the same time.

And what pirate can resist an easy treasure, even if it is already on your ship? There are merchant ships to raid but be watchful of the Royal Navy. Be the pirate with the most prestige at the end and you are unanimously elected the pirate king. That is the pirate rule. He who has the most gold makes the rules.<br/><br/>Overview:<br/>Pursue and Plunder is a strategy game for 2 to 4 players. Each player controls 4 pirate ships in an alcove of 9 islands which each hold various artifacts, items and gold. The players will plunder the islands, establish strongholds and attack merchant ships and each other in order to gain the most prestige. Players also have to avoid the Royal Navy that is patrolling the alcove. The game is played in rounds and at the start of each round each player distributes 7 crew tokens (4 regular crew, 2 drunken sailors, 1 captain) on their game mat secretly behind a player screen. Once all players are ready the screens are removed. Each player then takes 2 actions to move, attack opponents or plunder islands. The success of the actions depend on how the player distributed their crew tokens for the round. Artifact items and experience tokens provide additional flexibility to the actions being performed. At the end of the round, players may upgrade<br/>their cannons and sails, establish strongholds, and train crew to improve their chance of success in future rounds. Players are competing to be the first player to earn a set number of prestige points depending on the number of players. Prestige points are earned by finding artifacts, collecting gold, establishing strongholds and defeating merchants and the Royal Navy.<br/><br/>"}, "167269": {"poll": [], "name": "8BitBoy", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Macintosh Downloadable edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3025009.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Cute Fantasy"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["AwesomeBlade"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["Macintosh", "Windows"], "average": "3", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["AwesomeBlade"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3025009_t.jpg", "description": "8BitBoy - A tribute to my favorite games!<br/><br/>Growing up in the late eighties, I guess it&rsquo;s no secret where I got my inspiration from. My favorite games from that era were Giana Sisters, Wonderboy in Monsterland, Psycho Fox, Rick Dangerous, Megaman, Super Mario Bros and Sonic the Hedgehog. Each of these games has contributed to 8BitBoy in one way or another. 8BitBoy doesn&rsquo;t feel like any of the mentioned games in particular, but has elements from each of them.<br/><br/>It was crucial to me that this was going to be a full featured game and not some kind of short app game that is finished in an hour or two. So the game ended up having 12+ hours of main story gameplay and a lot of replay value and on top of that more than 200 hidden locations. Half way through making the game, I realized that this was a pretty ambitious decision to make for a one man indie title. Now I know why most platform games are a lot shorter. That said I&rsquo;m really proud of sticking with my initial plan and finishing this massive game.<br/><br/>A personal story behind 8-Bit Boy<br/><br/>The games storyline is somewhat based on my own story. Our hero is this depressed and unemployed 32-year old guy, who hasn&rsquo;t been able to get a job after finishing his exams one year ago. Our hero gets sucked into this happy, vivid and colorful 8-bit world where he has to overcome many obstacles to help him out of the status quo of unemployment and help him support his family. So this is a personal story that deals with some adult issues like unemployment and feeling inadequate. Combine that with a vivid and colorful 8-bit world and you get something very different.<br/><br/>This pretty much sums up my own story and I felt I had to do something about my own situation. To keep myself from going crazy from unemployment &ndash; I started programming 8BitBoy while looking for a job. So you might say that I also got sucked into this parallel 8-bit world of my own.<br/><br/>I really hope you will enjoy 8BitBoy as much I did making it.<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "167270": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2061270.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Medina"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Stefan Dorra"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Eduardo Bera", "Hans-Georg Schneider"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Gigamic", "Stronghold Games", "White Goblin Games"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2061270_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "City Building"], "boardgamehonor": ["2014 Golden Geek Best Abstract Board Game Nominee"], "description": "The year is 1822.

When starting the game, a player must join one of three factions: the Empire, Alliance or Renegades - all conveniently color coded, red for Empire, blue for Alliance, and green for the Renegades.  The player could never change factions, and would stay with that faction throughout the entire game.  Each faction had access to different tactics and abilities when in battle.<br/><br/>The game focused around building up the player's personal floating island.  When the player built specific places on the island, the player could unlock more resources which could be used to build a navy.  This navy would be used to raid locations around the world when on quests.  The player had the option of fighting AI creatures, or you could battle other players directly.<br/><br/>There were quests that players could complete scattered around the world.  Some were quests where the player had to kill a certain number of sky pirates, others were quests to control certain islands in the vast seas of Horizon.  There were new quests added at different times throughout the year too.<br/><br/>A unique point of the game was that each faction was competing to control the moon.  The moon would travel around the planet of Horizon, and once a month would be tethered to an island in the ocean.  Whatever faction controlled that island, everyone of that faction could complete the quests on the moon - and no one else could.  This meant entire factions would do focused strikes against specific islands during the month, leading to some very cut-throat battles.<br/><br/>While the game was a browser game, it did require Microsoft Silverlight to run.  It also followed a pay-to-win model, where the more money a player put into the game, the better ships, cards, and equipment that player would receive.  While someone could play the game without buying such things, but it would take much longer to achieve the more advanced levels than if that player had spent money.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, in May 2013, alaplaya stopped hosting Skylancer.  There is currently no way for anyone to play or access this game.

There are rules to play each game individually, but the set can be played in sequence as one long game, taking the players from the discovery of a new land, through colonization and industrialization, and finally to a bitter war for complete control of the land.<br/><br/>The first generation, Discovery takes about 45-60 minutes to play. You compete to grow your population while creating a unique map on which the other games will be played. Pieces are drawn at random, and different types of placements result in different &quot;scores&quot;. It is a relatively simple game of geometric strategy, along the lines of &quot;Dominoes,&quot; &quot;Carcassonne&quot; or &quot;Blokus&quot;. Your final score is based on how effectively and efficiently you &quot;discovered&quot; the land.<br/><br/>The second generation, Conquest takes about 60-90 minutes to play and is played on top of the map created by Generation One. This game is a race to colonize the map and build industries. You roll dice to determine where you can place your people on the board, or how you can impede your opponents. You trade in people from different land types to build industries. You can also build trade routes (allowing you to move people around) and  fortifications (to protect industries). You have to manage your assets wisely to win, but timing and luck play a role as well. The first player to achieve a &quot;stable society&quot; with four industries wins.<br/><br/>The third generation, War, also takes 60-90 minutes to play and is played from the end state of Generation Two. Your people have all become soldiers, trade routes are now blockades, and your industries are repurposed for the war effort. The basic mechanic for battle is similar to other world conquering games (like &quot;Risk&quot;) but your industries and blockades all have unique affects on the battlefield. Your armies can move and span across territories, resulting in a war that can ebb and flow to the very end.  The last remaining player is the winner.<br/><br/>The three games/generations are balanced in such a way to make it unlikely for a single player to win all three. And each generation uses different mechanics and different skills, allowing players of different types to engage with it.<br/><br/>"}, "167335": {"rpgdesigner": ["Maurice Broaddus", "Brendan G.

It will be released on October 9, 2014 in Australia and October 10, 2014 in the rest of the world.

The game was announced during Microsoft's E3 2013 press event, and was launched as a Windows open beta in December 2013, and an Xbox One beta in March 2014. It is based on Kodu Game Lab and is planned to be released in October 7, 2014.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Project Spark Is a digital canvas which can be used to make games, movies and other experiences. A player can download other user-generated content, remix that content or create content of their own. A player can use the Xbox controller, keyboard and mouse, touch-devices, Kinect and SmartGlass to build experiences. Kinect can be used to animate models and record audio. The created environments can contain mountains, rivers, and towns. The player can also create events, like inter-character battles. Created items and objects are able to be shared with other players.<br/><br/>Players choose whether to start from a blank map or a pre-designed level, but always have the tools to customize the topography, add plant and animal life, and program behaviors for specific objects, such as a rock that bounces when a player is nearby. The topography is modified by pushing and pulling the earth, digging through surfaces after changing the view to adjust a wall or create holes in it. Anything added to the terrain reacts to the circumstance, such as grass covering the floor and the vertical surfaces becoming rocks.<br/><br/>Game designer Claude Jerome has said that &quot;the game is all about giving players options&quot;, like the ability to add a single flower versus a field of flowers just by resizing the flower paintbrush's size. He added that the game is also about &quot;sharing and playing with the community&quot;, and that the difference between Spark and LittleBigPlanet or Minecraft is the core ability to customize the game down to the minutiae of the in-game object actions, which lets the players tell more individual stories. Players can control the game with the Xbox controller, SmartGlass, or a keyboard/mouse combination. The SmartGlass interface mirrors the Xbox One display, but adapts for touch controls when in editor mode.<br/><br/>Worlds created in the game are shareable. Other players who enter can use the world as created, and a duplicate world is created if they would like to make changes.<br/><br/>According to a post from Mike Lescault on the social media website reddit, Project Spark will not require an Xbox Live Gold Membership to be played.<br/><br/>The game will also feature the character Conker the Squirrel.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Project Spark&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "167342": {"poll": [], "name": "Tenkai Knights: Brave Battle", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Download Nintendo 3DS edition", "Europe Nintendo 3DS edition physical", "Japan Nintendo 3DS edition physical", "North America Nintendo 3DS edition physical"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Anime", "Movie, Book, TV show"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Namco Bandai Games Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Action"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo 3DS"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Namco Bandai Games Inc."], "description": "Tenkai Knights: Brave Battle (\u30c6\u30f3\u30ab\u30a4\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8 \u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30d6\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb Tenkai Naito Bureibu Batoru) is a Fighting video game developed and published by Bandai Namco Games, based on the anime series Tenkai Knights.

If it successfully matches the card, they place the Shopping Card, face-up, beside them as their scores, and return the basket to the center of the table. After that they give exactly one Shopping Card in hand to any one player next to them. However, if they fail to match the card, they must turn over one of their scored card (if any), face-down, and return the basket to the center of the table, and other players may try to play cards and grab the basket for themselves.<br/>The game ends immediately when one player has got rid of all their cards in hand.

It features a story in which Kathy meets actress Linda Turner (secretly the Black Cat), four battle scenarios, seven pre-generated characters, and a selection of Traits and Battle Maneuvers not included in the main rulebook.<br/><br/>"}, "167381": {"poll": [], "name": "Crystals of Time", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2490465.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Detective / Mystery"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["exosyphen studios", "RVL Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Hidden Object"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "4", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["exosyphen studios"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2490465_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Help Ashley Ford find her father and solve the mystery of the Three Oak Mansion.

They face the challenges of restoring Warsaw destroyed during World War 2, bringing back the city&rsquo;s prestige and importance in the fields of administration, culture and industry.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to rebuild Warsaw after the war and develop the city. The players have to get concrete, use the materials acquired from the debris of the destroyed Capital and various social funds that were used in reality during the rebuilding of Warsaw. However, not only the reconstruction itself is important, but also the appropriate location of the objects on the city map and competent delegation of the members of one&rsquo;s studio to work. One of the several tactical elements of the game is managing the project cards and workers. Using their extra abilities may be the key which will benefit one player and make the work much harder for another. But even for a moment they should not forget about acquiring building materials from prefabricated elements and building new panel blocks.<br/><br/>The game covers the period of thirty-five years, so in subsequent stages many various tasks appear. They are related to political doctrines, tendencies in architecture as well as the general economical and developmental situation in Poland in the given period. But the most important feature of the game is that each time the players are able to rebuild Warsaw in a different way from this known from history. They decide whether the historical rebuilding plan will be realized and where &ndash; if at all &ndash; the Palace of Culture and Science will stand. The players also have an access to the plans that were never realized, both from the Six-Year Plan and later urban development concepts. The game includes a futuristic element, too &ndash; the players have plans of two subway lines at their disposal. Such plans actually existed in post-war Warsaw, but they were never realized due to economic problems. In this game it is possible.<br/><br/>"}, "167405": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jamie Hardy", "Philip A.

With access to fighting vehicles that often ranked alongside the best the Allies had to offer, it was a foolish soldier or pilot who underestimated an Italian enemy.<br/><br/>This supplement for Traveller introduces many vehicles that formed the fighting arm of Italy in the Second World War, and provides full details of each, allowing them to be used within games. The weapons unique to Italy are also covered, along with enough information for you to use them in your own games and own vehicle designs.<br/><br/>Uses in Traveller<br/><br/>The vehicles found in this book could potentially form the basis of a campaign set in the Second World War. They may also be of interest to those who are simply curious as to how real-world vehicles can be implemented using the Traveller vehicle design system. However, we suspect many more players will want to actually use them in their games, even on planets far in the future and hundreds of light years away!<br/><br/>We have provided game mechanics for many vehicles, from the humble AB 41 armoured car, to the agile C.202 Folgore but, at the end of the day, a Folgore need not look like a Folgore if it were built to these specifications on an alien world. It could end up looking very different but have the same characteristics listed in this book. By this token, what this book provides is a solid set of military vehicles available at Tech Level 5. A referee can use them to fully flesh out a military force on a Tech Level 5 world and provide interesting variations on themes in order to give his world more depth.<br/><br/>For example, a referee creating a military force for a new world may simply design a single main battle tank for it before moving on to the artillery piece, the fighter plane, and so on. With this book, he can present a military force that has a defined timeline with the development of its vehicles, so there is not just one main battle tank but several, each a replacement of the one before though with all still in service, with the very best units getting the latest generation of tank.<br/><br/>Players can have fun with this book as well, especially if they are engaging in paramilitary actions or running their own mercenary force. What this book will provide them is a list of Tech Level 5 vehicles that, while outmatched by more sophisticated enemies, will be perfectly serviceable (and at a cheaper price!) on more primitive worlds and will be capable of standing up against infantry from higher Tech Levels &ndash; at least, until plasma weaponry and missiles become prevalent.<br/><br/>"}, "167426": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2266090.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Keewoong Kim"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Keewoong Kim"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Piece Craft"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2266090_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Novel-based", "Print & Play"], "description": "Following the White Rabbit, Alice entered the Queen&rsquo;s palace.

The Queen may move the White Rabbit only once, and Alice may move herself twice. Make sure you mark your path for each move.<br/>2.

If a player chooses (or is forced) to change race, they must flip their hand to the corresponding color.<br/><br/>The game also includes 22 Event cards, of which a random 10 are used each game.

For that, you can turn to a mythic heritage. This new aspect of mythic characters allows for further customization of your mythic character. A mythic character can choose a mythic heritage in addition to his or her mythic path, and doing so grants him access to a number of unique abilities that are designed to reflect the flavor of his heritage, while also being of value to characters of every mythic path.<br/><br/>This installment introduces the fey heritage, for characters who are in some way touched by or related to the mysterious and wild powers of the fey. They might be related through blood, either distantly or directly, to one or more creatures of the fey kingdom, or they may have simply earned the favor of a powerful faerie who chose to grant them a touch of her gifts. The character may have been a changeling, stolen from his nurse to be raised among the fair folk, or he may be ignorant of the origins of his power, discovering the fey&rsquo;s touch only as circumstances reveal where his abilities come from.<br/><br/>Whatever its cause, this mythic heritage allows you to harness the great cosmic powers of the heavens. This book includes 22 new mythic abilities, which together make up the fey mythic heritage.

Im 24seitigen Quellenteil wird auf das Erstellen und die Darstellung von NSC im Cthulhu-Rollenspiel eingegangen. Welche Funktion erf&uuml;llt mein NSC? Wie kann ich ihn darstellen? Wie sieht seine Motivation aus? Und welche Spielwerte sollte ich im Vorfeld festlegen?<br/><br/>Erg&auml;nzt wird dieser Abschnitt durch einige Namenstabellen, mit denen sich die g&auml;ngigsten Vor- und Nachnamen der typischen Cthulhu-&Auml;ren 1890er, 1920er und NOW abdecken lassen, einigen Namenstabellen f&uuml;r exotische L&auml;nder und auch eine umfangreiche W100-Tabellen mit besonderen Merkmalen, die jedem NSC mehr Farbe verleihen k&ouml;nnen.<br/><br/>Der zweite Teil bietet dann insgesamt 35 verschiedene NSC, die jeweils auf zwei Seiten vorgestellt werden. Jeder NSC erh&auml;lt eine umfangreiche Hintergrundbeschreibung. Ausserdem werden seine Verwendungsm&ouml;glichkeiten im Spiel dargestellt. Zu guter Letzt werden sein Verhalten und sein Aussehen beschrieben und einige Zitate erg&auml;nzt. Jeder NSC ist bebildert und mit seinen kompletten Spielwerten ausgestattet. Der besondere Clou: durch die zweiseitige Aufteilung ist es durchaus m&ouml;glich, einige der NSC als Spielercharaktere f&uuml;r OneShots zu verwenden, da Spielwerte, Verhalten und Aussehen normalerweise auf einer Seite zusammengefasst sind. Das gilt nat&uuml;rlich nicht f&uuml;r jeden NSC, einige sind doch sehr speziell.<br/><br/>Insgesamt finden sich sechs NSC f&uuml;r die &ldquo;1890er&rdquo;, f&uuml;nfzehn NSC f&uuml;r die &ldquo;1920er&rdquo; und sechs NSC f&uuml;r &ldquo;NOW&rdquo; in dem Band wieder. Doch auch die anderen, cthuloiden Settings erhalten spielbaren Nachschub: ein NSC deckt das &ldquo;Invictus&rdquo;-Setting ab, zwei sind f&uuml;r &ldquo;Mittelalter&rdquo; dabei, ein NSC f&uuml;r &ldquo;Piraten&rdquo;, ein NSC f&uuml;r &ldquo;Wild West&rdquo;, zwei &ldquo;Katzulhu&rdquo;-NSC und auch ein NSC f&uuml;r &ldquo;Noir&rdquo; ist im Buch enthalten. Die meisten NSC sind dabei aber universell genug, um sie recht problemlos zwischen verschiedenen Settings konvertieren zu k&ouml;nnen.<br/><br/>Als besonderes Gimmick liegt dem Band noch das Postkartenszenario &ldquo;Die Gesichtslosen&rdquo; bei, dass einen der im Band enthaltenen NSC in den Mittelpunkt r&uuml;ckt und auf kurze, pr&auml;gnante Art verdeutlichen soll, wie sich um die dargestellten NSC Szenarien schmieden lassen.<br/><br/>Ein Wort noch auf den Weg: der Pegasus-Verlag hat mir dankenswerterweise die Erlaubnis zu diesem einmaligen Projekt erteilt.
