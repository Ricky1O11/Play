It is designed for two players or teams. Components include a 4-part jigsaw-puzzle style board, a deck of weekly Event Cards, a deck of Daily Crisis cards, sets of red and blue counters, a campaign tally sheet, one red and one blue campaign die, a rules book and a summary playing sequence card.<br/><br/>Each state is classified by region, political philosophy (Liberal/Conservative), party preference (Democrat/Republican) and key economic interest (Mining, Manufacturing or Farming). Each party begins by choosing Presidential and VP home states (with local and regional benefits) and political philosophy (Conservative, Liberal or Moderate).<br/><br/>Each campaign week starts with an Event card that combines a random bonus/penalty event with a political statement or proposal. Candidates get penalties and bonuses depending on the stand they support. For instance, supporting a Southern Senator's controversial statement adds 3 regional points in the South but costs 1 in other regions and 2 in each Liberal state; denouncing has an opposite effect.<br/><br/>Each week has six campaign days. On each day, the candidate can make a personal appearance in any one state, adding 5 points in that state, sometimes modified by that day's Crisis card. Each party also has a limited number of media campaigns that can be targeted locally (+8), regionally (+3) or nationally (+1). Point counters are used to show net advantage in each state and in boxes for regions, economic interests, political philosophy and the nation as a whole, while the party advantages in each state are marked on the board.<br/><br/>The game runs for 9 weeks plus the Monday before Election Day. On election day, the result for each state is determined by tallying each party's net advantage in national, regional and local support, economic interest, political philosophy and party advantage, modified by a final -2 to +2 die roll by each party. The party with the highest net wins that state's electoral college votes, and 270 EC votes wins the election. An EC vote tie is broken by number of states won, with the District of Columbia being the final tie-breaker.<br/><br/>"}, "210969": {"rpgdesigner": ["Peer Bieber", "Phillipp Frey", "Tobias Grunow", "Tobias Hamelmann", "Jan Helke", "Melanie Helke", "Sascha Morlok", "Martina Sofie Noeth", "Benjamin Plaga", "Andreas Schroth", "Niklas Stratmann", "Martina Wiesch"], "rpgitemversion": ["German hard cover", "PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Datapuls ADL", "rpgartist": ["Tobias Grunow", "Rainer Harf", "Jan Helke", "Thomas Kruckenberg", "Nigel Sade", "Karsten Schreurs", "Andreas Schroth"], "rpgproducer": ["Ralf Berszuck", "Tobias Hamelmann", "Jan Helke", "Benjamin Plaga", "Stephanie von Treyer"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3223561.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["The Sixth World"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Modern Urban Fantasy)", "Science Fiction (Cyberpunk)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Pegasus Spiele"], "rpg": ["Shadowrun (5th Edition)"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3223561_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>Publisher blurb<br/><br/>Die Allianz Deutscher L&auml;nder &ndash; ein Flickenland, eine Region voller Gegens&auml;tze, ein tief mit den Schatten verwobenes Land.

However, it was the widespread introduction of the Human Interface that triggered a true revolution. The capabilities of cyborg soldiers for endurance, reflexes or pain tolerance far exceeded those of ordinary men. The ability to digitise the consciousness of the most accomplished experts was ground-breaking. The possibility of making a backup copy, as it were, put a new light on the questions of loss of life on missions and potential PTSD. But as life had it, theory and practice went their separate ways. The proper implementation of the Human Interfaces proved highly complicated and above all costly. It also spurred the rapid development of anti-cyborg weaponry, the most lethal of which was combat software, capable of disrupting the functions of a bionic body and, in the worst case scenario, taking total control over it. For politicians and the military loss of command of own soldiers was a nightmare turned into reality. As it turned out, an acceptable one. The benefits of the new technology simply outstripped the dangers by a large margin. That is not to say no contingency was put in place, a plan B was devised, so to speak. The Black Stone Commandos unit was to be such a contingency. A regiment-sized unit for reconnaissance, assault and counter-terrorism, it is employed wherever there is a risk of encountering cyborg soldiers. Its members are fitted with HIs, but their modifications are kept to a minimum in order to lessen the vulnerability to hacking. Thorough candidate selection, drawing on the highest Special Forces standards, harrowing training, and state-of-the-art equipment make for a further edge. The BSC work in small teams, their modus operandi being lightning fast assault aimed at catching the enemy by total surprise. They are also notable for employing hackers using sophisticated combat software. Following a number of spectacular successes, despite complete secrecy, the unit came to be a trump card in political struggle. For some they are a bargaining chip, for others, a valuable asset if expendable...<br/><br/>"}, "210631": {"poll": [], "name": "Human Interface: Nakamura Tower \u2013 BSC Ginger & the Banshee", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Point to Point Movement"], "yearpublished": "2016", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3211250_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Postindustrial Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3211250.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English edition"], "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Miniatures", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Daylight seeped in through the slitlike opening.

You make your way to the local inn and settle down for a nice hot meal when suddenly the door to the inn bursts open and what looks to be the local blacksmith calls out, &ldquo;Derek&rsquo;s farm on the outskirts of town has been attacked and the entire family has been slaughtered!&rdquo;  Never one to shy away from danger you walk over to the distraught blacksmith and ask about the family and what happened.  He tells you of a giant Red Dragon that has been terrorizing the town; sending out his minions to attack the town folk and raid for supplies.  These monsters seem to be coming from a dungeon just outside of town and there&rsquo;s nothing the town folk can do about it. The blacksmith tells you that he has heard of riches beyond imagination within the dungeon but also monsters of unspeakable evil.   After getting the location of the dungeon entrance you return to your party and talk excitedly about the current situation of the town and the Red Dragon.  Again, never one to walk away from a good adventure, although this would be considered your first, your party agrees to find this dungeon, destroy the dragon and all its minions forever!  <br/>   With everyone in agreement you procure a room for the night and settle in with visions of hundreds of screaming villagers chanting your name and praising your heroisms for killing the mighty red dragon and saving the town.   Yet it doesn&rsquo;t take long for a slight chill to run down your spine as your vision turns dark and terrifying with the sight of a massive red dragon and it&rsquo;s all-consuming, breath of molten fire engulfing the entire party and turning everyone to ash!    You quickly shake off the nightmarish vision and tightly close your eyes because tomorrow the adventure of your life begins!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Dungeon Hack &ndash; The Dice Game: is a Solo Dice chucking, Dungeon crawling, Dice Placement, character advancing, card game.  You&rsquo;ll take [4] first-time adventurers&rsquo; [Fighter, Cleric, Thief, and Wizard] through a randomly generated dungeon with Rooms, Junction Rooms, Corridor Rooms and Corridors.   You&rsquo;ll have to organize your party with two characters in front and two in back just how you would normally travel in a 10&rsquo; wide dungeon corridor.  The [4] &ldquo;Multi-level&rdquo; Character cards allow YOU to decide your party&rsquo;s order. This creates Front Line attackers/defenders as well as second line defenders.  Your characters will advance to the next level once they&rsquo;ve accumulated enough experience killing monsters. <br/>You&rsquo;ll explore dungeon corridors and rooms, fight monsters, try to avoid and disarm traps, discover gold and magical items, and complete quests.  Each turn you will roll the dice, evaluate your choices and perform your actions; destroying monsters, resolving traps and traveling deeper and deeper into the depths of the dungeon till you finally reach the ultimate goal &ndash; The Giant Red Dragon.<br/>If you can stay alive and escape the dungeon with at least three of your party members, you earn the right to live as heroes; enjoying the spoils of victory. <br/>Lose two or more of your party and you lose the game; becoming the next tragic story told at the local inn of a group of intrepid heroes seeking adventure and glory who never returned from the Red Dragon dungeon.<br/><br/>NOTE:  I would like to thank Tony Go for creating his game Deep Space D6 which not only inspired me to create Dungeon Hack but has help in some of the game play mechanics.

The object of each hand is to try to be the first to use all ten cards to form words.  Play is simultaneous and each player uses their cards to form words.  After each player has made as many words as possible they discard one unused card and dealer then deals a new card to each player.  Cards are exchanged until someone declares ABACA meaning that all ten cards have been used in words.<br/><br/>Primary ABACA: Seven cards are dealt to each player and for each hand, every player places down a card - the winner of the hand is the person with the card closest to the letter &quot;A&quot;.  Player with the highest number of cards won is the winner.<br/><br/>ABACA Royal: Players add to previously played cards to create a new word.<br/><br/>ARGO ABACA: Players are dealt seven cards.  Players will add multiple cards to previously played cards to create words.<br/><br/>ABACA Rummy: Players are dealt seven cards. One card is placed face up.  First player takes either face up or top of deck and create as many words as he can in front of him and then discards one card.  Play continues and players can pick up any number of cards from discard stack as long as they play the bottom card each time.  Play continues until someone has used all their cards.<br/><br/>Combination ABACA: Can be played as game of solitaire or with several players.  Shuffle deck and place 25 cards face down in a 5 by 5 grid.  The remainder of the deck is placed on the center card.  Play begins by turning over any two cards.  If they form a word player places cards in their pile and is allowed another turn.

Each type of cargo is represented by dice of a particular color. Example: Yellow = Corn. During setup and before the clock is started the cargo dice are rolled and the number of pips indicates the destination city.  Once the clock is started all players take their actions simultaneously, in any order, and repeating any action as often as necessary. To transport the cargo, the dice must first be loaded onto a short or long train piece that is at rest in the player&rsquo;s home city train yard. No train can move without a red caboose die, and no caboose can travel beyond the adjacent player&rsquo;s city. In order to transport cargo to more distant cities a train will need to first stop and have the caboose dice swapped or cargo exchanged between trains. While all this is going on players must avoid dropping or spilling cargo or caboose dice when picking up or handing the train to another player. Tunnels and bridges between some cities present additional obstacles to negotiate. When time runs out calculate the score and compare the results to the achievement chart. Positive points are awarded for goods delivered to the correct city and trains that are able to stop in a train yard. Points are subtracted for dropped cargo, dropped cabooses, or cargo delivered to the wrong city. Players should try again to beat their best score and time. Optionally multiple teams can use additional copies of the game to compete head to head.<br/><br/>With six players each takes one of the six main cities, each producing a single type of goods which are delivered to the other five locations.<br/>City #1 - Los Angeles &ndash; produces and ships Perishable Goods &ndash; Orange dice<br/>City #2 &ndash; Denver &ndash; produces and ships Minerals &ndash; Grey dice<br/>City #3 &ndash; St. Louis &ndash; produces and ships Corn &ndash; Yellow dice<br/>City #4 &ndash; Chicago &ndash; produces and ships Meat &ndash; Pink dice<br/>City #5 &ndash; Pittsburg &ndash; produces and ships Steel &ndash; Blue dice<br/>City #6 &ndash; New York &ndash; produces and ships Manufactured Goods &ndash; Purple dice<br/>Note in some scenarios with fewer total players, each player may actually control multiple cities.<br/><br/>The components that make up one player&rsquo;s city are as follows:<br/>One City Name marker<br/>One associated city number-tent (#1, #2, #3, #4, #5 or #6)<br/>One &ldquo;Goods Production Source&rdquo; card. Example: Illustration of a corn field for the production of corn. <br/>Five &ldquo;Goods Received&rdquo; cards (to hold goods arrived from other cities).<br/>One train yard (spaces for two trains, only one of which will fit the long train)<br/>One short train (unloaded) (the TTR-1aB)<br/>One large train (unloaded) (the BFT-9000)<br/>Three customized Red dice (each represents a caboose, one for both starting trains and one spare). All three caboose dice start on the train yard in the designated caboose track. The number on the caboose matters and should match the home city. <br/>One set of cargo dice (all of a single color)<br/><br/><br/>Cattle and Timber and Beer, Oh My! Expansions (sold separately) <br/>For additional challenge, smaller satellite cities can be added to the game. They come with a smaller train yard but no trains of their own.
