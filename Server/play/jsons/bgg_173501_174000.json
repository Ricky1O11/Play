Some of the cards are kept back to ensure that it is more difficult to predict what you will land on. The cards are initially face-down and Tokens are placed on the cards.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to collect 10 Tokens and then be the player who turns the last card face-up.<br/><br/>Each player has two Pawns which are moved around the cards according to the role of two dice. During the first phase of the game Tokens are collected when a player lands on the cards. The card is then turned face-up and any instructions followed. For example it could be a &quot;Booby-Trap&quot; card which forces your Pawn out of play. In which case you need to roll a 6 to bring it back in to play.<br/><br/>During the second phase of the game most of the Cards will have been turned-face up and most of the Tokens collected. It now becomes more important to keep both Pawns in play to give you some flexibility in choosing which cards you land on. You and your rivals will be trying to force Pawns out of play, trying to steal Tokens, and generally attempting to turn the last card face-up. The cards have various effects which assist (or hinder) you in this. Many of the cards interact with each other. For example if a rival's Pawn is on the &quot;Philanthropy&quot; card (which obliges him to give away 2 Tokens every time somebody else's Pawn goes out of play) it could be a good move to land on &quot;Maelstrom&quot; which forces all Pawns out of play. Most of the cards have effects that can be used to advantage in this way.<br/>Each turn you also have the option of rolling the &quot;Panic Die&quot; which gives you other alternatives. You may choose to do this, for example, if your initial dice roll was particularly disadvantageous of if another player is about to win. You do however have the chance of losing half your Tokens - but even this can be turned to your advantage if you realise how.<br/><br/>"}, "173503": {"poll": [], "name": "GaLakTik TakTik GT01 Basic Set", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1993", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2439618_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["PewterCraft"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2439618.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Choose your favorite Empire and Starship and command it in a pitched battle with enemy ships.

Players move letters like Chess pieces to string together words that connect horizontally, vertically and diagonally on a 7-by-9 grid. To score big assemble long words and make sure you have a end of game strategy to clear the board.<br/><br/>Setup: 48 Letter tiles are randomized on a 7-by-9 grid. At the start of the game there are 15 empty squares near the center of the board. The center horizontal row is always empty. Bordering the center row, two rows are made up of four empty squares and three letter squares (like a parapet which is the alternate name). Use any word game you may own to play the game.<br/><br/>Game Mechanics: The main object of the game is to assemble words on the grid. Eligible words must have letters connected on the board horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Acceptable words must be at least three letters long. Words cannot be played more than once per game and proper nouns are not allowed. Individual letter tiles cannot be used twice in the same word (such as &ldquo;o&rdquo; twice to spell book or &ldquo;d&rdquo; to spell dad).<br/><br/>During a single turn, a player can move multiple letters together to construct words. All letters moved during a turn must be used to construct a word that round. Consonants can move any number of squares horizontally, vertically or diagonally (like a Queen in Chess) to an empty square. When moved, however, consonants cannot jump over other letters. Vowels can move two squares horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally (like a Knight in Chess) to an empty square. Unlike consonants, vowels can jump over other letters. After a word is constructed those letter tiles are removed from the board and play continues. The game ends when all letters have been used or no more plays are left. Lastly, the letter &ldquo;Y&rdquo; moves as a consonant even if used as a vowel.<br/><br/>Scoring: Letter Chess uses simple formulas to tally a score at the end of the game. So when playing keep a pencil and paper nearby. Vowels count as 2 points and Consonants count as 1 point. The letter &ldquo;Y&rdquo; counts as one point even if used as a vowel. A word is tallied by multiplying the letter score by the letter count. For example, &ldquo;murals&rdquo; has a tally of forty because there is a letter score of eight (two vowels and four consonants) and a letter count of five (8x5=40). There is a bonus score when all the letters are cleared from the board. The bonus is calculated by multiplying the number of rounds by 10 and subtracting that amount from 200 (arbitrary number). For example, a whole board was cleared in twelve rounds then 200-(12X10)= 80 points. When letters remain on the board with no more moves left those letters are tallied as a word and subtracted from the score. For example if the letters &ldquo;I, X and O&rdquo; remain on the board. The letter score is 5 and letter count is 3 which equals 15 minus points.<br/><br/>At most there are 16 rounds per game assuming all words are 3-letters long. In Letter Chess, a high score is in the 400&rsquo;s and a low score is around 200.<br/><br/>"}, "173550": {"poll": [], "name": "Adventure Time: Card Wars", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android edition", "iPhone/iPad edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2417768.png", "videogametheme": ["Card / Casino Games", "Cartoon", "Fantasy"], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Kung Fu Factory"], "videogamefranchise": ["Adventure Time"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone"], "usersrated": "3", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Cartoon Network"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2417768_t.png", "description": "Floop the Pig!

In this battle Ottoman forces advanced northwards, towards the present day Bulgarian-Romanian frontier. Russian infantry and cannons were able to stall the polyglot Ottoman army, and although they managed to eke out a marginal victory their commander, General Kutuzov, chose to yield the key town of Rousse to the Ottomans, convincing them they had won a great victory. The Czar was not pleased.<br/><br/>Slobozia 20 focuses on the latter battle of 2 October 1811. In this engagement Kutuzov conducted a surprise march which cut off and surrounded the bulk of the Ottoman army, trapping it on the northern (Bulgarian) shore of the Danube. The result was a decisive Russian victory that permitted negotiations to end the war. This had the dual advantage of allowing Russia to transfer key reserves to oppose Napoleon&rsquo;s invasion of Russia in 1812, and also prevented Austria from contributing more forces to support the French invasion.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.26364", "name": "Wallachia 20", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "22", "boardgameaccessory": ["Wallachia 20: Mounted Maps"], "boardgamefamily": ["Napoleonic 20"]}, "173630": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Floyd Pretz"], "poll": [], "name": "The Gallows", "playingtime": "40", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Variable Player Powers", "Voting"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2423032_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unpublished)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2423032.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "40", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Deduction", "Negotiation"], "age": "13", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "The Gallows are ready!

Now you&rsquo;re back in town, healed up, cleaned up, and ready to party at the Red Dragon Inn. Drink, gamble, and roughhouse with your friends. But don&rsquo;t forget to keep an eye on your gold. If you run out, you&rsquo;ll have to spend the night in the stables. Oh&hellip; and try not to get too beaten up or too drunk. If you black out, your friends will continue the party without you&hellip; after they loot your body for gold, of course! The last conscious adventurer with gold wins the game!<br/><br/>The Red Dragon Inn 5: The Character Trove is a standalone game for 2-4 players. It expands on &quot;The Red Dragon Inn&quot; family of box sets and single-character expansions called Allies. You can mix and match characters from any of these sets, letting you build the party composition of your choice! Each of the box sets includes four unique characters, a drink deck, gold pieces, and all the parts for 2-4 players to play right out of the box. Each of the Allies expansions includes a character deck as well as gold pieces and bits so you can add another character to a box set (thus making a 2-4 player collection playable by 2-5 players).<br/><br/>Sera the Fleetfooted: Sera is a stealthy rogue whose speed and agility allow her to take down roomfuls of bad guys before they even know what&rsquo;s happening. The dungeon&rsquo;s beefiest monsters are no match for her flying daggers! She didn&rsquo;t get so skilled by slacking off, though. Even while she&rsquo;s partying, she continues training to make sure she&rsquo;s always at the top of her game.<br/><br/><br/>    The Good: She hones her skills by sparring with her friends.<br/>    The Bad: Sometimes she does this without warning them first&hellip;<br/><br/><br/>Lizwick the Collector: Lizwick is a consummate problem solver with an unrivaled collection of gear. Her wondrous Bag of Holding contains rare and peculiar items of all descriptions. She is always on the lookout for the next amazing whatchamacallit to add to her collection. Lizwick has gotten The Party out of many a jam with the clever application of the wrong tool at the right time.<br/><br/><br/>    The Good: Lizwick&rsquo;s collection is the envy of academies, guilds and hoarders alike!<br/>    The Bad: &hellip;and they&rsquo;d like their stuff back.<br/><br/><br/>Joran the Trickster: Joran&rsquo;s penchant for pranks earned him a student &ldquo;sabbatical&rdquo; from the Mage&rsquo;s Collegium. Fortunately, Zot saw some potential in the boy, and decided to take him adventuring for some valuable field experience. The young mage&rsquo;s humor has proven to be mostly harmless to his new friends. He puts his clever brain to good use by pulling fast ones on the bad guys.<br/><br/><br/>    The Good: Joran&rsquo;s talent for misdirection makes him the perfect weapon against enemy spell-casters.<br/>    The Bad: It also makes him the perfect weapon against his friends&rsquo; gold, their sobriety, their patience&hellip;<br/><br/><br/>Zakhan the Drunken Master: Zakhan&rsquo;s father is a solemn elven noble and a guru of meditative martial combat techniques. His mother was a rowdy barbarian warchief with a penchant for throwing wild parties. This unique heritage has allowed Zakhan to hone a seemingly reckless hybrid fighting style of his own. His opponents who underestimate his &ldquo;drunken&rdquo; martial arts do so at their own peril!<br/><br/><br/>    The Good: Zakhan&rsquo;s drunken fighting techniques make him a formidable foe.<br/>    The Bad: Sometimes he&rsquo;s actually just drunk.<br/><br/><br/>But wait, there's more!

For their part, the rest of the edgewalkers don't really seem to mind. After all, how can one toe the path between two extremes if those extremes didn't exist?<br/><br/>Like edgewalkers, motebringers understand that light and darkness are two sides of the same coin. Unlike edgewalkers, motebringers believe that one of these halves is inferior to the other. Totally locked out from selecting darkness-based waypoints, the motebringer specializes in light-based waypoints and the shaping of physical material from nothing more than a glimmer of radiance.<br/><br/>The motebringer's iconic ability is the creation of a radiant shawl, effectively a sheet of light worn in the shoulders slot. Each morning, the motebringer can customize his radiant shawl with a number of infusions, which grant offensive, defensive, and utility abilities to it.

Legendary Showdown: Machines &amp; Magic is a game of comically epic battles where each player uses strategy, sabotage, and one-upmanship to develop a secret battle plan.  This lighthearted and easy-to-learn tabletop game is designed to be enjoyed by experienced gamers and newcomers alike.  Haven&rsquo;t read the comics before? No problem! No background reading is required to help your characters win battles and be the last one left standing! Let the mass chaos, devious strategies, and humorous battles begin!<br/><br/>Who is this Girl Genius?<br/>Girl Genius is a three-time winner of the highest honor awarded for works of science fiction and fantasy: the prestigious Hugo Award.  The webcomic follows Agatha Clay, a seemingly mild-mannered mechanic who discovers she has inherited the abilities of a spark (a feared mad scientist with the natural ability to understand complex sciences and wield them for their own chaotic purposes). Even more shocking, Agatha discovers that she is the descendent of a long lost line of sparks whose unparalleled skills and insanity made them legends in their own time.  Cleverly written and beautifully illustrated by Kaja and Phil Foglio, Girl Genius is full of adventure, romance, and plenty of MAD SCIENCE!<br/><br/>What is this &ldquo;Gunnerkrigg Court&rdquo; of which you speak?<br/>This highly praised comic is the work of the celebrated author and artist, Tom Siddell.  The story follows Antimony Carver as she attends an isolated boarding school called Gunnerkrigg Court.  Antimony soon learns that the Court is no ordinary school - the teachers are hiding ancient conspiracies, it is bordered by a forest full of dangerous monsters, and the school is inhabited by strange creatures and students with special abilities.  In the course of her adventures, Antimony befriends an ancient trickster god, discovers her own supernatural powers, and begins investigating the dark secrets of the court.<br/><br/>Why do we love these comics so darn much?<br/>If you aren&rsquo;t already faithful readers, allow me to let you in on a little secret: these comics rock.  The stories are masterfully crafted, the art is top notch, and the characters are instantly endearing.  It's no wonder that these comics have won so many rewards and attracted such loyal fans.  We also appreciate that both comics feature characters who make great role models.  For example, Antimony Carver and Agatha Clay are some of the strongest and most intelligent women you could hope to meet and their friends will stop at nothing to stand by their sides.<br/><br/>How to play the game that will... change your life:<br/>Each player is dealt a total of five characters from the worlds of Girl Genius and Gunnerkrigg Court.  These characters line up in anticipation for their chance to battle.  During the round, you try to equip characters in your line with powerful weapons and bonuses while equipping characters in other players&rsquo; lines with faulty or otherwise terrible equipment.  You can also give yourself secret advantages or sabotage your opponents.  When the round ends, the characters at the front of each line will engage in a (legendary) showdown.  But the madness doesn&rsquo;t stop there!  You can rearrange your line and the lines of your opponents to change who will be competing in the final battle.  The round suddenly ends when all players but one (the poor chap) are ready to fight.  At that point, each player reveals his or her battle strategy and the winner is decided.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "average": "6.39643", "name": "Legendary Showdown: Machines and Magic", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Player Elimination", "Rock-Paper-Scissors", "Take That"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "28", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "173678": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Switching to Guns (Issue XXXIII - Mar 2009)", "rpgdesigner": ["Matt Borselli"], "rpgproducer": ["Matt Borselli"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2420320.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Switching to Guns"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Slang!"], "rpg": ["Labyrinth Lord"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2420320_t.png", "description": "From the Introduction:<br/><br/>Another Ashford Valley issue, this time covering some of the slang in the valley, from the towns to the countryside as well.<br/><br/>"}, "173679": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Switching to Guns (Issue XXXIV - Mar 2009)", "rpgdesigner": ["Matt Borselli"], "rpgproducer": ["Matt Borselli"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2420321.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Switching to Guns"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Thugs and Mad Inventors Out in the Noonday Sun"], "rpg": ["Labyrinth Lord"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2420321_t.png", "description": "From the Introduction:<br/><br/>So I've had some Ashford town adventures for my Ashford Valley setting chat-game and I plan on another five adventures, this time set in Clifton.

That will make the PCs pretty powerful. However, I designed each adventure to be able to be played by 1st through 3rd level PCs, so it is necessary (and fairly obvious) that each adventure be increased in difficulty by the GM. All this was done to come to this point - the necromancer's end game.<br/><br/>This issue will outline the plans and goals of the necromancer, while next issue I'll talk about the necromancer himself and some of his minions that the PCs haven't met yet.<br/><br/>"}, "173698": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Switching to Guns (Issue L - Apr 2009)", "rpgdesigner": ["Matt Borselli"], "rpgproducer": ["Matt Borselli"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2420339.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Switching to Guns"], "rpgissuearticle": ["End Game, Part II"], "rpg": ["Labyrinth Lord"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2420339_t.png", "description": "From the Introduction:<br/><br/>This final issue completes the Ashford Valley campaign.

There are always more defenders than attackers. Combat is conducted in duels. Mace wielding combatants have the upper hand, but the outcome is decided by rolling the dice.

Upon further inspection you notice the Robot is controlled by an encrypted code sequencer and you need to figure out how to connect your Code Analyzer to the Robot&rsquo;s timer.  Your new high-tech Code Analyzer is used to bypass the Robot's timer and prevent the robot from destroying is massive program!  To do this you must figure out the wiring sequence from the mass of wires in front of you and rewiring the robot to include your code analyzer, which will eliminate the timer and allow you to over-right the Robot's &quot;self destruct&quot; timer!  You have less than 16 minutes to figure out the wiring sequence and connect your Code Analyzer.  If you can figure out this circuit and connect each of the four individual wires from the robot's timer to your code analyzer, you will safely stop the timer and eventually defuse the Robot's &quot;self destruct&quot; timer; saving your job as well as the bosses robot!

These connections will be made through the [16] wire routing tiles on the game board. The robot itself is amass of wires, which is represented by the 4x4 grid of wire tiles on the game board that are routed in different directions to try and prevent you from defusing the robot. Your goal is to figure out the four individual wire routes to connect your code analyzer to the robot's timer. You must figure out a complete connection route for each wire from the code analyzer to the robot's timer before the timer runs out and robot's memory wipes!<br/>You have special wiring tools that allow you to manipulate the wires and create or change the route of each existing wire or wires. With your tools in hand you can swap wires vertically and horizontally 1, 2, or 3 spaces. You can also rotate the direction of a specific wire or wire group up to 270 degrees. The last tool allows you to actually cut out &ldquo;replace&rdquo; a wire or wire group with a new wire or wire group from the bottom four tiles!

Each player also has a hand of spells - one-time effects that help the player or hinder opponents.

Player-shared pieces: All players share ownership of the same tiny boat in the swamp, so the actions of any one player impact every other player directly.<br/><br/>2. Secret and shared objectives: Everyone knows the main objective, but each player also has a hidden goal that might lead the whole expedition into deadly peril!<br/><br/>3. Player controlled game-length: Players can speed-up or slow-down the game down depending on their preference. Some will try to get out of the swamp quickly, while others will delay until they've collected precisely the right combination of treasures.<br/><br/>4. Surprise ending: It is unlikely that anyone can know with 100% certainty who has won the game before each player's secret objective is revealed, leading to an exciting reveal at the very end!<br/><br/>5. Efficient use of physical components: Despite its small size (35 cards and two pieces), most cards have multiple uses and orientations leading to a surprisingly deep set of decisions each player can make. Furthermore, as players move deeper into the swamp, the swamp expands from the action card deck, opening up greater adventure, while at the same time triggering a built-in game timer.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "age": "13", "name": "Swamped", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming"], "average": "6.18661", "usersrated": "112", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "173771": {"rpgartist": ["Jacob Blackmon", "Justin Mason"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Cultus Sanguineus", "rpgdesigner": ["Jonathan Ely", "Justin Mason", "Mike Myler", "Brian Wiborg M\u00f8nster", "Rory Toma"], "rpgproducer": ["Rachel Meyers", "Mike Myler", "Jonathan Nelson"], "usersrated": "0", "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2422112.jpg", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgsetting": ["Aventyr Campaign Setting"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["AAW Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["AaWBlog Presents"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2422112_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>AaWBlog Presents: Cultus Sanguineus takes four to five 8th-9th level PCs through wondrous Mohkba, capital of the Klavek Kingdom in Aventyr, in pursuit of a dark and insidious organization&mdash;before the party is caught up in the cult's fell schemes!<br/><br/>This series of products from AdventureAWeek.com are compilations of our monthly themes, packaged together in a handy, bookmarked PDF!<br/><br/>Within AaWBlog Presents: Cultus Sanguineus you'll find:<br/><br/>    4 magic items, including the items Sanguineus themselves (as well as the corrupting sanguine chalice)!<br/>    3 quests that can be used in any game (an alleyway chase, an elitist ball gone awry, and a ritual bloodbath)!<br/>    3 new maps, one for each quest!<br/>    2 armies for use with the Mass Combat rules: one of unlikely nobles, the other rabid cultists!<br/>    4 devious traps like the false coffin and sanguineus mirror!<br/>    4 blood drenched haunts: the alleyway of blood, blood vortex, rain of blood, and sanguine avarice!<br/>    3 GM articles to smooth over all the neck wounds!<br/>    10 NPCs and new creatures!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>A plot most foul brews in the gem of the Klavek Kingdom, but GMs and PCs alike are sure to find something to love in AaWBlog Presents: Cultus Sanguineus!<br/><br/>"}, "173772": {"rpgdesigner": ["Mark A.

In Pathfinder, however, curses often lack much bite to begin with, and are quickly dealt with by casting remove curse. What is it that makes the curses in the fairy tales so much more powerful than the curses you have access to in the game? There are many answers to that question, but one of them, is the power of vengeance.<br/><br/>The eleven spells contained within this book are far more powerful&mdash;and much harder to get rid of&mdash;than most curses in the game. Inflict the target with an instant and all-but-incurable magical form of leprosy. Steal his ability to speak entirely. Have each harmful spell he casts turned back upon him (at a three-for-one ratio)! Fill him with an endless, insatiable hunger, or taint his seed, so that all of his progeny are horrifying demons. This magical power has a catch, however: each curse in the book functions only if the target performed some specific action to wrong you (or someone else), thus leaving themselves open to the curse&rsquo;s power. What exactly it takes to be vulnerable to the curse varies from spell to spell: for some, simply casting a harmful spell, or attacking a flat-footed creature is enough. For others, the target might need to mock a god or religion, to be unfaithful to their lover, or to tell a lie.

The dwarves&rsquo; silver mine has cut into the tunnels of a monster lair, and now a band of adventurers is fighting for their lives in the narrow confines of the mine against a band of monsters. Each player starts with 7 of 18 characters (18 Monsters or 18 Adventurers). The winner is the party that drives the other from the mine!<br/><br/>Only the first character in each party can use hand-to-hand combat. Other party members can use ranged weapons or special attacks -- provided they have a clear line-of-sight over their companions&rsquo; heads. In these tight quarters, jostling for position is important. It&rsquo;s great to have your troll at the head of your party, given his strength, but then no one behind him can see past him to use a ranged attack. If your halfling is at the front, everyone taller can fire over him, but he himself won&rsquo;t be doing much damage.<br/><br/>Each turn you can either battle (roll 2 six-sided dice) or take an action (see below) and attack with 1 die. Each die roll is assigned to a character whose abilities match that roll &ndash; each card has die faces on it, with corresponding attacks: 1 = Rush, 2 = Strike, 3 = Panic, 4 = Fell, 5 = Do, 6 = Kill.<br/><br/>You can download the 4-page PDF from the Files section.

The goal is the first player to 4 bible studies. You gain a bible study by finding the Sheeplike one out in the territory or be the last player still in the round.<br/><br/>Setup:  The territory consists of 9 cards (houses) grouped in 3 piles hiding where the Sheeplike and Do Not Call cards are.   Shuffle the Sheeplike, Do Not Call and 1 Not Interested cards and create 3 piles.  Then deal 2 more territory cards on top of the 3 piles.  Players are each dealt 1 card each from the publisher cards.<br/><br/>The game consists of 2 stages:<br/><br/>Door To Door: Players draw and play cards searching through the territory stacks for the Sheeplike one. There are 17 publisher cards that allow players to flip the cards in the territory and move cards around within the stacks. This allows for players to hide traps and uncover the Sheeplike card. If a Do Not Call is flipped without the protection of the Bible card, that player has to sit out of the current round. If the Sheeplike one is not found by the time that there is no more publisher cards to draw from then the next stage starts.<br/><br/>Return Visit: Once all cards have been drawn from the publisher draw pile. All players turns over their one card in their hand.  Whoever has the highest value card, they get the first pick of where they think the Sheeplike card is at.

Can you navigate your ship trough the forces of nature?<br/><br/>How to play:<br/>First you will spread the chips with the hidden side on the harbor-cities. <br/>Every player choses his harbor , receives passenger-chips and catering cards at random to start into the game. <br/>The game is split into 2 phases. The action-phase and the movement phase.<br/>In the action-phase the player will throw 2 dices and has 2 choices. <br/>He makes one action or both actions that correspond to the number on the dices or he chooses to make one action that doesn&rsquo;t match the number on the dices. <br/>All other players can then choose from one action which the active player hasn&rsquo;t chosen. <br/>This will give the active player a little advantage but the other players have still a lot of choices. <br/>The player will then make the action he has chosen. <br/>These actions will be released by cards, which you got initially in the action phase.<br/><br/>You can also get event cards. But they aren&rsquo;t always positive. <br/>A food-inspection can make you lose points.  There can be stowaways under the passengers on board, which will make you lose points on a coast guard control.<br/><br/>When all actions have been done you will proceed to the movement phase. <br/>All players move their ships on the beautiful wooden board. <br/>The active player has again a little advantage. <br/>He can move the ship equal the total number of both dices. <br/>The other players can move their ships with the number of the higher dice.<br/>You will get points when you deliver your passenger(s) to the target harbor on you card and when you have enough food to take care of them.<br/>The game can be won by two ways: <br/>1. Be the first to reach 40 victory points. <br/>2. During the game the player receives a personal goal which he keeps secret.

Through the introduction of new resources, illicit hardware, and clever programs, the gang&rsquo;s criminal influence pervades every aspect of this Data Pack, starting with a new Criminal Runner identity, then reaching outward as other Runner factions are supplied with the sort of tech you don't normally find in America, and finally rippling into every aspect of every card as Corps are forced to deal with the gang&rsquo;s members in one way or another.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "French first edition", "German first edition", "Italian Edition", "Spanish first edition"], "average": "8.34667", "name": "Android: Netrunner \u2013 The Underway", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Hand Management", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": ["Android: Netrunner"], "usersrated": "105", "boardgamefamily": ["Android", "Android: Netrunner LCG", "Cyberpunk", "Hackers", "Living Card Game"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Breaking News \u2014 Episode 38"]}, "173910": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Princes in the Tower (Issue 2 -

But beware, careful placement of supplies, weapons, and buildings may be the only chance you have to ensure a successful rescue.<br/><br/>PHASE 2: ASSAULT. In the Assault phase, the player takes charge of leading the rescue attempt by invading the map just built in the Recon phase. Again, the player places Tetris-like puzzle pieces to eliminate the enemies they just placed, avoid minefields, destroy tanks, and attempts to leave all trapped comrades open for rescue. Miss a sniper, and your entire rescue attempt can fail. Step on a land mine, and craters will start filling up the battlefield and stop your troops.<br/><br/><br/>Offering 4 levels of difficulty, Jigsaw Commando provides hours of addictive fun as the battlefield becomes more and more complicated between each wave.

Or will the hoof of Auroch the Red Boviking crush the Celtucky Chickens?<br/><br/>How do you play? <br/>Each player takes their choice of Barnyard Legion and mixes some of their cards into a common deck. The rest of their cards are kept as their own deck. Each turn, players take 2-3 actions, attempting to complete a battle line of five cards from their Legion. To keep the game moving, every player draws a card from their deck at the start of each round, hoping to not run out of cards, causing elimination, before the battle has been won.<br/><br/>What is unique about it?<br/>The game has built in subtleties that will appeal to gamers, while the unique decks and humorous tongue-in-cheek art make Barnyard Legions a great gateway game for players who are not familiar with more complicated card games. Families will be able to sit down and follow the very simple rules and start playing immediately.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "13", "name": "Barnyard Legions", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Tile Placement"], "average": "7.75", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "173947": {"poll": [], "name": "King of the Jungle", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2434384_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Lakeshore Learning Materials"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2434384.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Children's Game", "Educational", "Trivia"], "age": "9", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Publisher's description:<br/>Who will be the first predator to reach the top of the food chain?

The cards have a puzzle piece edge, and each card only fits its pair.<br/><br/>There are two possible ways to play.  One is called Match Out.  In this game, cards are placed face-down and each player draws an equal number.  The first player places the top tile on their stack face-up.  Each player in turn then turns up his or her top tile.  If it matches any of the turned-up tiles, the player matches them, puts them aside, and turns up the next tile in his or her stack.  This continues until no matches are made, and play passes to the next player.  The first player to eliminate his or her stack wins.<br/><br/>In ABC Rummy, letter and picture tiles are places in separate piles.  Players take turns drawing from either stack until they all have four tiles in their hand.  If any players have matches, they may lay them down immediately.  Each player then draws a tile from either pile and tries to match it to tiles in their hand.  If there is a match, they are put aside and the player may draw again.  If not, the player may keep up to four tiles and must discard any others face-up in the middle of the table.  Further players may draw from either the piles or the face-up tiles, making as many matches as possible.
