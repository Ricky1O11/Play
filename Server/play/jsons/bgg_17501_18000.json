On the morning of October 1, they stumble onto Browne&rsquo;s army deployed around the little town of Lobositz on the Elbe River.

The main goal is to breed, exchange and gather different animals (rabbit, sheep, pig, cow, horse and two kinds of dogs) and the winner is a person who can gather at least one of each kind (except the dogs). But be careful there are foxes around trying to snatch your rabbits and wolves which can eat all your other animals (that is why you need dogs to protect your herd).<br/><br/>The game was designed, and originally named &quot;Hodowla zwierz\u0105tek&quot; (&quot;Animal husbandry&quot;) in the occupied Poland during Word War Two by famous polish mathematician Karol Borsuk and his wife. In these hard times the game became very popular and there were many home made copies sold by the Borsuks family. Sadly during the Warsaw rebellion at the end of war all copies were destroyed save one that was in another city. After the war it was returned to the Borsuks family. Now one of the Polish publishers decided to release the game.<br/><br/>The turn of each player consists of two actions: first you have a possibility to exchange your animals according to the special table (e.g for six rabbits you get one sheep, three pigs for a cow) and then you roll two special 12-sided dice with the pictures of animals on the sides. You count the number of pairs of the animals on rolled dice (together with the ones on the farm) and this is how many new animals you get, divided by two. The trick is that there is a fox on one dice and the wolf which are eating your animals.<br/><br/>The game is mostly based on the luck factor (dice). But there is a little strategy to it. Do you go for more &quot;expensive&quot; animals (which have less probability of creating offspring) or you stay with fast breeding but &quot;cheap&quot; rabbits. Do you exchange your animals for an &quot;insurance&quot; (dogs) from the foxes and wolves or risk in order to catch up with others farmers?<br/><br/>Game was intended for children but surprisingly it is also fun for adults.<br/><br/>Reimplemented by:<br/><br/><br/>    Have You Herd?

Militia must be &quot;mustered,&quot; and &quot;go home&quot; at the end of each campaign year.  Natives are influenced by &quot;gifts and supplies&quot; and by battlefield victories.  Road, Indian trail and Water movement all have key roles in operations.<br/><br/>Battles occur between opposing forces occupying the same point.  Engagements take place on an inset map determined by terrain and situation: &quot;Attacking/Defending Fort,&quot; &quot;Open Ground,&quot; &quot;Wood&quot; (forested) or &quot;Landing.&quot;  Modifiers apply depending on whether engaged units are Regulars, Militia, or Indians, Rangers and Couriers de Bois.  Units engaging in battle line up opposite one another.  A &quot;hit&quot; is determined by a D6 roll of &quot;6.&quot;  Die rolls are modified according to unit type and battle setting (Regulars defending a fort, for example, are &quot;plus 2&quot;, hitting on a four or better).  All units, except Iroquois, are flipped on the first hit and eliminated on the second.  At the start of his/her battle turn, a player may elect to &quot;retreat&quot; in lieu of firing.  Retreating units move to an adjacent friendly point, preferably toward their Base of Operations.  At the end of a victorious battle, flipped pieces are turned back to full strength, and one victorious militia unit, if present, may be &quot;promonted&quot; to a Regular or Ranger (British) or a &quot;Troop of the Marine battalion&quot; or &quot;Courier de Bois&quot; (French).<br/><br/>Fortresses can be built; Towns and Fortresses can be burned.  Supply is critical at the end of a campaign year; all Regular and militia units must occupy either a town or fort, or is not connected by a red road (not trail).  They  must be able to trace supply by road or waterway to their Base of Operations (Montreal or Quebec for the French; Boston, New York or Philadelphia for the British).  Regular or militia units which fail these conditions are eliminated unless they are in a seaport.<br/><br/>The powerful Iroquois Nation is key to victory.  Three of the six Iroquois tribes begin aligned with each side (the counters are two-sided).  After each battle, the victor of that battle flips one Iroquois unit to his/her side.  Any time a player begins his/her turn with all six tribes oriented to his/her side, the Iroquois have joined him/her for the duration.<br/><br/>The other twenty tribes are activated to support the French either by the activities of the Couriers de Bois, or by French bribes (&quot;gifts and supplies&quot;).  Except for the Iroquois, Native tribes usually &quot;go home&quot; after a victory (to celebrate).<br/><br/>Victory is determined by conquest.  The French must begin a turn, or end the game, holding Albany and one of New York, Boston or Philadelphia, or must deny the British their victory conditions.

Players are dealt a hand of six cards, each depicting animals.  Each animal is labeled as either PREY or PREDATOR and has a numeric value based on its strength in the wild.  Players also have a playing piece that's actually a small plastic animal (my set has a zebra, a gorilla, an elephant, and a rhinoceros).<br/><br/>On a player's turn, she may either toss their hand and draw six new cards or play a PREY card face up.  Then, going 'round the table to the left, each player may play a PREDATOR card of equal or greater strength.  The next player in succession can only play if their PREDATOR card is of higher strength than any previously played predator.  Also, any predator played against the prey must also inhabit a common continent with the prey (color coded spheres on the cards--see, educational).<br/><br/>If no PREDATOR cards were played, the owner of the PREY card moves forward the strength of that card.  If one or more PREDATOR cards were played, the owner of the highest one played battles the owner of the PREY card via an on-board spinner.  A player spins and consults the difference in value between the predator and prey (four possibilities: 0, +1, +2, or higher).  Wherever the spinner stops, simply check to see the color of the difference in values.  If that number is yellow, the prey escapes, if it's red, the predator &quot;captures&quot; the prey.  The owner of the winning animal card moves forward a number of spaces equal to the PREY card's strength.<br/><br/>The spinner is divided into only five segments.  Four seem to be of equal size and the larger one (about 40% of the dial) is all yellow.  So, the odds are with the prey.  But with a more-than-plus-two differential, there's less than a 15% chance of escape.<br/><br/>At the end of a player's PREY turn, she replenishes her hand to six cards.<br/><br/>The movement track is 50 squares long.  First animal playing piece to the end is the winner.<br/><br/>This is probably not technically a children's game, but I think that's the audience that it suits best (though the idea of those cute little animals being &quot;captured&quot; by predators might be a bit much for some kids).<br/><br/>"}, "17601": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Chicago in a Box", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Set Collection", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "1997", "usersrated": "8", "boardgamefamily": ["... in a Box", "Cities: Chicago (Illinois, USA)", "Country: USA", "Monopoly"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic93759_t.jpg", "average": "5.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Late for the Sky Production Company"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic93759.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Late for the Sky Production Company edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Negotiation"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "A Monopoly clone from Late For The Sky; this version is based in Chicago, Illinois.

This is the third volume from the award winning Musket &amp; Pike Battles Series detailing 17th Century warfare, often known as the Dawn of Modern Warfare. This volume features the rise of the French Army after their entry into the Thirty Years War in 1635. Two of the greatest captains of French history - Louis de Bourbon, the Grand Cond&eacute; and Henri de la Tour, the vicomte de Turenne - take the field to set the stage for Le Grand Siecle - the Golden Age of France under Louis XIV, the Sun King.<br/><br/>After taking on the English Civil War in This Accursed Civil War and the combined arms tactics of the Swedes and Imperials in Sweden Fights On, the Musket &amp; Pike Battles Series looks at the French, Spanish and Bavarian armies. The Spanish tercios face the superb French gendarmes. The stalwart Bavarians with their excellent cavalry and love of entrenchments battle the veteran Weimarian cavalry corps.<br/><br/>Armies are divided into several wings. Each has a commander and an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Victory goes to the player that can coordinate the actions of his wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry battalions, cavalry regiments and artillery batteries. Rules include cavalry charges, cavalry pistols for skirmishing or for close combat, and artillery grazing fire. Play is highly interactive and most battles can be played through in one sitting. The five battles in Under the Lily Banners are:<br/><br/>Rocroi 1643 - The debut of the young duc d'Enghien (later known as the Grand Cond&eacute;). The most famous battle of the Thirty Years War that broke the power of the Spanish tercios. The French faced a larger Spanish army but the energetic Enghien refused to quit when all seemed lost and snatched victory from the jaws of defeat.<br/><br/>Freiburg 1644 - Enghien joined forces with Turenne facing the well entrenched Bavarians. The battle raged for over 3 days until the French were worn down. The French declared victory then bypassed the town. A very different style of battle than any other from the period due to the terrain, style of attack, and duration.<br/><br/>Mergentheim 1645 - The Bavarians surprised Turenne's army and inflicted a stinging blow. This is the smallest battle in the series and is included as a learning scenario.<br/><br/>Alerheim aka Second N&ouml;rdlingen 1645 - Turenne, reinforced by Enghien and German Allies from Hesse-Cassel, again faced the entrenched Bavarians. The Bavarians, reinforced by the Imperials, held two hills and the town. Enghien attacked the town and Turenne, at the head of the elite Weimarian cavalry corps, attacked the Bavarian right. The excellent cavalry commander for the Bavarians, Jean de Werth, saw Enghien's attack bog down in the town and attacked the French right, smashing it. The French were losing until the Bavarian commander, Franz von Mercy, fell and in the confusion, allowing Turenne to pull out a victory. The casualties were so heavy the French ended the campaign season three months early.<br/><br/>Lens 1648 - The resurgent Spanish under the Archduke Leopold brother of the Holy Roman Emperor pressed into Flanders to recapture the fortress of Lens. With domestic unrest and a military failure in Spain, the French seemed vulnerable. The Grand Cond&eacute; rushed to the rescue. The Spanish took the high ground, hoping Cond&eacute; would attack as he had at Alerheim. Instead, he turned and began to retire. A cavalry skirmish with the French rearguard escalated and drew both armies into the action piecemeal. The veteran Spanish tercios smashed the elite gardes fran&ccedil;aises, taking their colors as revenge for Rocroi. The French cavalry proved superior and drove off the Spanish horse, leaving the body of infantry isolated on the field where they surrendered en masse. This shattered the last hopes for the Habsburgs, ending their involvement in the Thirty Years War with a defeat.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>1 series rulebook<br/>1 playbook<br/>3 countersheets<br/>2 backprinted mapsheets (3 one map battles and 2 half-map battles)<br/>1 die<br/>Player Aid Cards<br/><br/>Nominee for the 2005 Charles S.

Otherwise, the player must end the turn by discarding. After completing one&rsquo;s own sequence, the player may use subsequent turns to use the Bullet cards to eliminate the other players one at a time. A player who is the target of another player&rsquo;s Bullet may avoid elimination by discarding a Miss or Ricochet card. Playing a Distract card forces the targeted player to skip a turn. Play continues until the winner remains.<br/><br/>The game also contains some optional rules.<br/><br/>"}, "17680": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Harry M.

Many numbered counters are provided to place with ships to show their Z-axis positions.<br/><br/>Two copies of the map are provided, allowing players in a two-player or team game to move their ship counters on the map simultaneously. After movement players compare their maps to determine which enemy ships are in range, and then write down firing and shield usage orders, which are again resolved simultaneously. Using weapons and shields costs energy, which must eventually be replenished at a home base or by borrowing from another ship.<br/><br/>Several levels of play are provided. The basic game is as described. The standard game adds several features - tracking (ships are placed face-down on the map and only revealed when successfully probed), hyperspace movement (conducted off-map), carrier ships, etc. The advanced game adds a few more features, notably supply points, and more importantly allows players to create their own ship designs (ships in the advanced game have 21 different components, allowing for considerably customization).<br/><br/>There are a few optional scenarios, including one which allows for up to four individual players (this requires either additional copies of the map, or some players to write down their moves). Four players can also play the standard and advanced game scenarios in teams, as the forces each contain two different groups of ships.<br/><br/>The original version of the game was published in 1971.

It blends mythology and multiplication to create an innovative game which lets kids drill multiplication while engaging in epic mythological battles.  For the first time education is infused into the wildly popular dueling/ collecting card phenomenon. Welcome to a FRESH TWIST ON FLASHCARDS with this fun new MULTIPLICATION GAME!<br/> Each player uses his own Mythmatical Battles Deck, with 55 cards featuring gods, heroes, and monsters from Greek, Celtic, Norse, or Egyptian mythology. Every card has one multiplication equation for its attack strength and one equation for it's defense strength. A single deck contains all the multiplication equations from 1x1 to 9x9.<br/><br/>The players take turns drawing cards from their decks, placing them face-up to the &quot;Field&quot; (known to grown-ups as the table, desk, or floor), and challenging their opponent's cards.  The card with the highest product wins.  But look out --Magic and Weapon cards can change card strengths, and weaker cards can team up to conquer a powerful card.<br/><br/>Each defeated opponent's card goes into the player's &quot;Plunder&quot; pile. The game ends when one player's deck is exhausted. The player with the most cards in her &quot;Plunder&quot; pile when the game ends, wins.<br/><br/>A full deck game takes 45 minutes to play. Or you can play time limit games to fit into a busy class or home schedule. To win a time limit game the person with the most cards in his &quot;Plunder&quot; pile when time's up wins.<br/><br/>Mythmatical Battles is designed for kids in the 3rd to 6th grade. Any kid (and there are millions) who's played with other dueling cards will easily catch on to the rules of Mythmatical Battles, plus learn classic mythology and rock solid math.<br/><br/><br/>"}, "17737": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Elvira Vomstein"], "poll": [], "name": "Fun Numbers", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "1982", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic315143_t.jpg", "average": "2.66667", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Otto Maier Verlag"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic315143.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Dice"], "age": "4", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "&quot;A very colorful game to keep all children amused and to help introduce the very young ones to numbers.&quot; - Ages 4 - 8.<br/><br/>Each player is given a lotto-style board which shows eight pictures.

At its most complex it becomes a game in which players use identical sets of dice that all need to be manoeuvred into a sequential row, using the eyes to determine movement range.<br/><br/>At the start, players roll their own colour dice (6 in a two player game, 4 in a three player one). Then, in turn, players position these dice on an empty board space, one by one, and never altering the face value. When a player manages to create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of 4 own dice, that player wins the round. The victor scores the total pip count of these dice, or the best dice string if the created row exceeds its required length. When all dice are on the board, and no row has been completed, players may move one own die per turn to an adjacent space, but not diagonally. The aim is to score the most points over a given number of rounds.<br/><br/>Anyone vaguely familiar with placement games won't find this much of a challenge, and for these players a couple of trickier variant rules are suggested. Any combination of these variants can be used, to eliminate randomness and increase complexity as desired.<br/><br/>- (2 player only:) to win, a row of 5 or even 6 is needed. <br/>- players don't start by throwing the dice, but use identical sets instead (1-6 or 1-4).<br/>- a winning row also needs to have the dice in the correct sequence, low to high.<br/>- dice may be moved as many squares as their face value, allowing directional changes too.<br/><br/>The designer isn't credited, but in all likelihood it is Hans-J\u00f6rg N\u00fcrnberger, as Hanje was the vehicle for Hans-J&ouml;rg and Ursula N&uuml;rnberger's own designs.<br/><br/>PUBLICATION HISTORY:<br/><br/>     1975 Hof Hanje Spiele-Atelier - out of print<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>As with some other Hanje games, the small box is made out of wood, and the board is printed on its lid.<br/><br/>ADDITIONAL INFO:<br/><br/>     language skill needed: language neutral.

For example, the Northern and Crimean White Russian forces gain extra resources if they keep control of their ports (representing aid from the U.K., U.S., and France), while the Bolsheviks and Ukrainian Anarchists gain extra resources from any of the core Russian areas they control (representing support from the local populace).<br/><br/>Combat rules also follow Axis and Allies, with some extra rules for trenches (which aid defense), bi-planes (very weak in the game), generals (who can add their &quot;combat factors&quot; to any units they share an area with when attacking or defending), etc. Ten-sided dice are used for combat. Certain nations, such as the Bolsheviks, Poles, and Ukrainians, have more effective infantry than others. The handful of Czech infantry controlled by the Siberian White Russians also gain bonuses in combat.<br/><br/>After combat, players must spend resources to &quot;incorporate&quot; the territories they conquer. Only after a territory has been incorporated can the new owner collect resources from it.<br/><br/>The number of territories on the map is enormous. This increases tactical opportunities, but it would seem that this could make resource collection somewhat onerous for some nations. While the Poles begin the game with 31 resources, the Bolsheviks begin with 306! Of course, the Bolsheviks are under attack from nearly every direction, so they need the bonus.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "average": "2.83333", "name": "Rise of the Red Army", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Russia", "Russian Civil War", "War to End All Wars"]}, "17859": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic463737.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Hex Hex XL"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Curt Covert"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2005", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Curt Covert"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Smirk & Dagger Games"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic463737_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Fantasy", "Humor"], "description": "From the company's website:<br/><br/>Our Deviously Simple, Delightfully Mean-Spirited, Wickedly Fast-Paced game, HEX HEX is back with a vengeance in HEX HEX NEXT.<br/><br/>Featuring all new cards, this latest edition can be played as a stand-alone game or added to your current HEX HEX deck for even more fun ways to &lsquo;stab a friend in the back&rsquo;.<br/><br/>Play with no cards in your hand - by using the hands of others with &lsquo;No Man&rsquo;s Hand&rsquo;.

Each player receives four passengers - colored wood pieces - who must be brought to their destination station.  A passenger can only board a railroad car if the vacant car is directly before their entering space.

The game is designed by a former professional player - Billy Hamilton.<br/><br/>The game is conducted in three phases:<br/><br/>The Apprenticeship - three (game) years of learning the skills and demands of being a footballer, as well as performing the thankless, but necessary, tasks essential to the everyday running of a football club.  This apprenticeship is the foundation upon which the professional career is built.<br/><br/>Professional Footballer - As a professional, the player strives to maintain a high standard, on and off the pitch.  He becomes more involved in duties outside the game and must lend himself to charitable and promotional work.  His good performances on the pitch may lead to international recognition.<br/><br/>Gain International Caps - It is the dream of every player to play for his country and win the World Cup.<br/><br/>The Apprenticeship stage is conducted by undertaking three circuits of the outer board based on a roll and move mechanism.  Activities are driven by the actions required of the squares on which the playing piece lands.
