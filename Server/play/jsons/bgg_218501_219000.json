Their destination was the fringes of the galaxy, where there was a chance to gain a foothold and grow in strength again, and perhaps find new allies for the fight against the Znu and Decima empires. Learning of this plan, the great empires sent their own worldships, following Earth to the edge, determined to stake their own claim and win the war for the fringe.<br/><br/>In Empires of the Void II, each player has been given command of a mission by an alien empire to establish a foothold at the fringe of the galaxy. The game begins when their massive Worldships reach the fringe, where they must explore, wage war, use diplomacy, and construct buildings to gain victory. The fringe is sparsely populated, and many of the sentient species here are struggling to survive, leaving huge regions of planets open for exploration and colonization.

A lot has changed since then, but we believe we can keep the same magical feeling, providing a faster and more adrenaline-filled game experience.<br/><br/>Warstones is a tactical army-building game, with a dexterity mechanism at its core. Choose your units, deploy them on the battlefield, then flick... eh... lead them! Control key areas to gain victory points, defeat enemy units or just push away the strongest. Dexterity is just one of the countless features of Warstones. Army building provides a lot of options and flexibility, so even if you don't believe in your flicking skills, don't worry! There are different kind of armies, and plenty of room for customization; you will find the army that works for you!<br/><br/>&quot;Low profile, don't lose control!&quot; thought Bramhun while crossing an unknown tavern's door. Wildlife sought shelter from an unnatural cold in the southernmost regions of the kingdom that year. That's why many dwarven hunters like him found themselves lost in such hostile lands.<br/><br/>&quot;Adapt to the situation, even if it means compromising with the enemy.&quot; Facing the long journey back to home would have put himself and that big load of skin in danger. Mokgul, an orc all covered in blood and tannin, suddenly turned his head and sized up the unwelcome guest, like many other inn patrons did. He closed the door. The curious barrel on his back couldn't be ignored. A complex, twisted rod made of wood and iron &mdash; a ridiculous dwarven hunting tool, indeed.<br/><br/>Brahmun spoke to the orc behind an heavy wooden counter. &quot;Where's the tanner?&quot; The innkeeper pointed at a table by the fireplace with a nod. The light of the fire shone off Mokgul's face. On his table, there was a pelt with a map carved into it. You might have seen three rudimentary towers lying on it, and many rounded and flat stones, painted with stylized warriors, too.<br/><br/>&quot;What do you want from me, dwarf?&quot; said Mokgul, while he was just staring at the table.<br/><br/>&quot;I don't like doing business with you just as much as you don't like doing business with me, but I got a considerable amount of skins, precious as...gold.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Sure, but I think I could smash your dwarven head and take your stuff instead.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Be my guest, but I'm not that naive. They are hidden far away from here, mate. If I die, you won't find them, ever, and you will lose your share.&quot;<br/><br/>Mokgul suddenly stood up, then raised his voice to get attention: &quot;And what if me and my mates force you to tell us where all your goods are, in exchange for the opportunity to see sunrise tomorrow and to walk out of here on your two feet?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Fine! Here's the deal: I'm gonna give you all my goods and all my money, but you have to defeat me. On the other hand, if I win, you will pay me twice their value!&quot;<br/><br/>After that statement everyone in the room gathered round the table yelling &quot;Warstones! Warstones!&quot; Bramhun came up to the table and collected a handful of painted stones.

In fact, the first op-ed pieces on that theme began appearing in newspapers--both within the country itself and elsewhere around the world--before the ink on the first copy of the constitution was even properly dry back in 1787. The genre even had a name: &quot;declinism.&quot;<br/><br/>Similarly, the reasons given for that supposedly inescapable fall have generally always--from the late-18th century to the present--been divided into three categories: ethno-racial conflict, class conflict, or some mixture of the two. America Falling enables two players to simulate the entire first year of a hypothesized near-future civil war--brought on by whatever is your own favorite reason--across all of the lower-48 states.<br/><br/>One player commands the conservative &quot;Red&quot; forces while the other leads the liberal &quot;Blue&quot; forces. The rules also allow for the possibility of local separatist movements erupting independently of those two main factions, including: The Republic of Texas, The Islamic State in America (ISIA), New Jerusalem, Aztlan, La Raza, Aryan Nation, New Afrika, Ecotopia, and The LGBTQ Rainbow Coalition.<br/><br/>Conflict can take place with conventional armaments as well as Weapons of Mass Destruction. Cyberwarfare is a constant.<br/><br/>No two games will set up or play exactly alike. The initial territorial division between the two sides is based on major cities (chosen randomly) rather than on whole states.<br/><br/>Game mechanics recreate the inescapable dilemmas of fratricidal struggle inherent at the start of every civil war. The keynote centers around the fact one military has suddenly become two. That means things previously taken for granted--chain of command, supply, political loyalties, etc.--have become uncertain. Nothing can be depended on; for instance, movement allowances among the same type of units may vary by as much as a factor of 12.<br/><br/>Play moves rapidly back and forth during each turn, one &quot;action&quot; at a time, in any order the players choose: enter reinforcements from off-map areas; regroup previously devastated units; move a friendly force; attempt to subvert an enemy force to defect to your side; launch a conventional, cyber or WMD attack; move your capital or attempt an airpower surge. In the end, victory hinges on the balance between control of key terrain and accumulated demoralization within the factions.<br/><br/>Product Information<br/>Complexity: 6 out of 10<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 8 out of 10<br/>Time Scale: six two-month turns<br/>Map Scale: 33 miles (54 km) per hex<br/>Unit Scale: brigades, with abstracted air &amp; naval power<br/>Players: one or two, best with two<br/>Playing Time: four to six hours<br/><br/>"}, "218526": {"poll": [], "name": "Wacky Wings", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Flight"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Pocket Money Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Racing"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Pocket Money Games"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Arcade-style ride and take to the skies.<br/><br/>"}, "218527": {"poll": [], "name": "Henry The Hamster Handler", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Pocket Money Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Pocket Money Games"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>You are Henry, the legendary one-handed hamster handler, and it's your job to save the mass-produced balls of fluff.<br/><br/>"}, "218528": {"poll": [], "name": "Love Engine", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Renxiang Game"], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Renxiang Game"], "description": "Love Engine is a game, which on the basis on a Chinese traditional festival called Magpie Festival.

A Spanish Galleon floats nearby, and you&rsquo;ve talked your crewmates into working together to steal all of its treasure. What you haven&rsquo;t told your fellow pirates is that you have no intentions on sharing the treasure once you have it. Your crewmates have told you that they share your loyalty and that they&rsquo;ll help you maroon the greedy pirates on your ship to the rocky island of Tortuga. But you&rsquo;ve seen your friends&rsquo; loaded pistols and heard their whisperings of a mutiny. You know that nobody can be trusted.<br/><br/>Tortuga is all about the interactions you have with the other players. In some cases, such as when you and your shipmates are attacking the Spanish Galleon, you need to rely on your enemies in order to succeed. In the very next turn, however, your shipmates might stab you in the back with a mutiny in order to keep all the treasure for themselves.<br/><br/>Since nobody holds a &quot;hand&quot; of cards, this game is also about knowledge and communication regarding the community Event cards. Unless you are in desperation mode, it is not wise to reveal Event cards at random. Almost half of the Event cards can hurt your team drastically. It's often in your best interest to use an action to view the cards first, or to rely on the knowledge of a trusted ally. Knowing where harmful Event cards are located allows you to force an enemy to reveal those cards and suffer the consequences. The most successful players are the ones who are able to discern who is on their team and then share vital information with them at opportune moments.<br/><br/>Vote cards also play a key role in the game. Each Vote card has three sections - one each for Attacks, Mutinies, and Brawls. Players must put themselves in the best position to use their Vote cards, since their hand of Vote cards may not always be ideal based on their pawn location. For example, sometimes it may be worth putting in Water, causing an attack to fail, in order to save a Crossbones card for when you want to Mutiny against your captain.<br/><br/>For 2-9 Players. 20-40 minutes.

Yet even they must knowledge the unique strangeness of the Beastly Buddy, an overly friendly beast which spends much of its time as a stuffed toy.<br/><br/>The Beastly Buddy&rsquo;s origins are uncertain and vague, largely because it can no longer speak in its native language. From what can be deciphered, the Beastly Buddy grew tired of the hostile plane which spawned it and resolved to travel somewhere new. Upon reaching the boundary to its realm however, an especially cruel enemy trapped it with Magical Manacles which literally turn it into a child&rsquo;s toy. Only the matching key will restore the Beastly Buddy to its natural form, and the two were separated for centuries. The Monster was passed between various households and magical collections over the ages, although few could break its secrets.<br/><br/>When the Beastly Buddy is freed, it becomes immensely loyal to its rescuer, calling them Master and serving their command. There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any magical compulsion to do so - the Beastly Buddy is just rather genuinely grateful for the attention. (In fact, it&rsquo;s also known to snatch up its Master in harmless Bear Hugs whenever the mood strikes it.)<br/><br/>Unfortunately it&rsquo;s also quite gullible, and can be fairly easily convinced to do actions against its interest or which would bring great harm. Thanks to its immense physical abilities, this has led to many tragic instances where the Beastly Buddy has been freed by evil forces to wreak havoc on unsuspecting enemies. Grappling the creature and replacing its manacles is usually enough to restore order, at which point it will become grateful to the next being to free it. There is a chance to change its mind, especially when food is involved. The Beastly Buddy is strangely partial to poisoned food or anything rotten.<br/><br/>"}, "218546": {"poll": [], "name": "Jim's LectraMatic Football", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Point to Point Movement", "Secret Unit Deployment"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3486844_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["LectraMatic Games Inc"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3486844.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Sports"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This is a very large and unusually sophisticated electric football game that appears from the photos on the box and rules to date from the early to mid-1960s. It uses metal player pieces that are inserted into holes on the board both to set a hidden defensive formation and to run offensive plays.<br/><br/>Behind a cardboard shield, the defensive player places 11 men into his choice of the 29 holes on the defensive side of the playing surface. These are arranged in 7 lines: Deep Back (3), Back (5), Quarterback (3), Scrimmage (7), Beyond (3), Short Pass (5) and Long Pass (3).<br/><br/>The offensive player then decides both on the play and a risk factor (that adds to both gains and losses). He then inserts a man into appropriate holes, one at a time. A Backfield Run must start in a Fullback or Half-back hole, then either Deep Back or Scrimmage, then Beyond. A QB Sneak starts at the QB hole, then to Scrimmage, then to Beyond and to a Breakaway hole. For a pass, the QB starts in his own hole, then to Deep Back, and to any hole in either the Short or Long Pass lines.<br/><br/>In essence, the offensive player is trying to guess where the defending players are and navigate a path through them. If there is no defensive player in the hole he uses, he carries on to a hole of his choice in the next line for the play; if there is, a red light goes on and the play ends, with the results coming up on an electric spinner and multiplied by the risk factor table. If he reaches the breakaway hole, a green light comes on, leading to a big gain.<br/><br/>The game thus enables the defense to be shaped for any situation, from guarding against a long pass to running a blitz by placing a defensive player in the QB hole and/or one or more Deep Back holes.<br/><br/>There are rules for tracking time, using time-outs, and penalties (for instance, when the offense uses an illegal sequence like QB - Scrimmage - Long Pass). The positions of the football and the 10-yard sticks are marked on a strip running along one side of the playing field.<br/><br/>"}, "218547": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3117314.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Corey Konieczka", "Lukas Litzsinger"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "10", "boardgamepublisher": ["Fantasy Flight Games", "Asmodee", "Asterion Press", "Delta Vision Publishing", "Edge Entertainment", "Galakta", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3117314_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fighting", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Science Fiction"], "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Enter a world of epic, saga-spanning, &quot;what if&quot; battles with the Kylo Ren Starter Set for Star Wars: Destiny!

First, Siberia is relatively close by and, once secured, the resources extracted from it need not be shipped overseas in order to get them to Chinese factories.

However, the Iranian clergy, that headed the government, did not trust the lay and military leaders, many of whom the clergy suspected of harboring pro-Shah or anti-fundamentalist adherents, and ordered a more limited but immediate offensive in early January.

The battle pitted two of the great Leaders of that era against each other: Julius Caesar and Vercingetorix.

Players pick command markers to generate actions, modeling the chaos of the original battle. The Gallic objective is to break out of Alesia and link up with the relief army coming in from off the map. The Roman&rsquo;s (caught in the middle) objective is to defeat the Gauls and eliminate Vercingetorix. There are two players in the game: Roman and Gauls. The game consists of three Days of Battle. Within each day, there will be several turns based on the command markers. There are 176 5/8in counters, with a 22x34 inch map depicting the area around the fortified village of Alesia and the Roman fortifications and towers surrounding the village.<br/><br/>"}, "218684": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Joseph Miranda"], "poll": [], "name": "Windhoek", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "yearpublished": "2018", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Magazine: Strategy & Tactics"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3407185_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Decision Games (I)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3407185.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War I"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Windhoek is a wargame of the campaign in which British Empire forces, mainly from the Union of South Africa, conquered the German colony of Southwest Africa. In the original campaign, the British won within ten months, but the campaign could have gone different, as von Lettow Vorbeck demonstrated in German East Africa. This is a two-player game, in which one side commands the Germans, and the other Allied forces (including South Africa, British and Portuguese colonial). The Allied player must win the game quickly, while the Germans win by delaying the Allies beyond the historical time frame. The central game mechanism is Action Points (AP). These are a quantification of each sides command and logistical capabilities. Players expend AP to recruit units and conduct various military operations. The game has two levels: The Standard Rules, which give a quick wargame, and the Advanced Rules, which give more realism and complexity. Windhoek includes 176 5/8 inch counters and a 22 x 34&rdquo; map with each hex representing approximately 25 miles .<br/><br/>"}, "218685": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Ty Bomba"], "poll": [], "name": "Last Stand at Isandlwana, 22 January 1879", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "yearpublished": "2018", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Magazine: Strategy & Tactics"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3407166_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Decision Games (I)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3407166.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Last Stand at Isandlwana, 22 January 1879 is a two-player tactical wargame of low-intermediate complexity simulating the last 90 to 240 minutes of that infamous and legendary battle of the Anglo-Zulu War.

The British is attempting to win by having some remnant hold out longer than occurred historically or, alternatively, by having some portion of his command escape off the map and get back to relative safety at Roarke&rsquo;s drift. Solitaire-play is easily doable. Each game turn of Last Stand is equal to five to 20 minutes of &ldquo;real time,&rdquo; depending on the tempo of action in each turn.

When their first product debuted at Gen Con 1976, it heralded the next chapter in the Golden Age of RPG publishing. Judges Guild introduced the concept of the adventure module, among many other innovations, and changed the course of Dungeons &amp; Dragons play.<br/><br/>Now, 40 years later, Judges Guild has authorized Goodman Games to publish archival collections of classic Judges Guild material. This volume contains 1970&rsquo;s-era Judges Guild RPG publications, scanned from the original publications and digitally restored. Contained within these pages you will find the legendary adventure modules Citadel of Fire, Tegel Manor, and Thieves of Fortress Badabaskor. Each of these adventures changed the course of role playing. Also included herein are scans of the original Judges Guild Journals, the gaming periodicals that were shipped with each installment of Judges Guild mail order product. The Judges Guild Journals have never before been reproduced in any format. Finally, you will find a number of historical essays, as well as all-new game material expanding the original adventures, all authorized by the Judges Guild.<br/><br/>Gamers today who seek to recapture the excitement of their youth will find it in the pages of the Judges Guild. This book connects you to an era of unbridled imagination. It collects some of the finest work of Judges Guild in its original published form.

Players design their ships using parts and technologies to fit their particular strategy.  Once their ship is built, its time to start rolling and exploring the galaxy!<br/><br/>There are three types of ship parts, Cargo, Colony, and Engine, and four technology trees that can be used to specialize your ship.  At the start of the game players have a budget they spend to build their ship.  Each ship part is represented by a different d6 and how far a ship moves each turn depends on the role of the dice.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to amass the most credits.  Players earn money by discovering new locations, delivering miners to worlds they can mine, earning income from their colonists and delivering goods back to the Galactic Hub.  Credits can also be used to improve player's ships, either adding more pieces or upgrading technologies.<br/><br/>The board is a spiral galaxy with six arms connecting the center to the outer rim.  The number of players determines which arms are used.  The game ends when certain parts of the board have been completely discovered or a turn limit, whichever comes first.<br/><br/>"}, "218763": {"poll": [], "name": "The Magic School Bus Bonus Pack Volume 3", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Windows edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3370594.jpg", "videogameseries": ["The Magic School Bus Explores"], "videogametheme": ["Children's"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Microsoft"], "videogamegenre": ["Educational"], "videogameplatform": ["Macintosh", "Windows"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Microsoft"], "videogamecompilation": ["The Magic School Bus Lands on Mars", "The Magic School Bus Volcano Adventure", "The Magic School Bus Whales and Dolphins"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3370594_t.jpg", "description": "From the Box Cover<br/><br/>This bonus pack of Scholastic's The Magic School Bus software from Microsoft brings the fun and adventure of the award-winning TV and book series to your computer!<br/><br/>"}, "218764": {"poll": [], "name": "The Magic School Bus Bonus Pack Volume 2", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Windows edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["The Magic School Bus Explores"], "videogametheme": ["Children's"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Microsoft"], "videogamegenre": ["Educational"], "videogameplatform": ["Macintosh", "Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Microsoft"], "videogamecompilation": ["The Magic School Bus Explores in the Age of Dinosaurs", "The Magic School Bus Explores Inside The Earth", "The Magic School Bus Explores The Solar System"], "description": "From the Box Cover<br/><br/>This Bonus Pack of Scholastic's The Magic School Bus software from Microsoft brings fun and adventure of the award-winning TV and book series to your computer!<br/><br/>"}, "218765": {"rpgartist": ["Josh Atack", "Matthew Harris", "Kevin Massey"], "rpg": ["Elite: Dangerous Role Playing Game"], "poll": [], "name": "Elite: Dangerous Role Playing Game Core Book", "rpgdesigner": ["Oliver Hulme"], "rpgproducer": ["Oliver Hulme", "Bruce Kennedy", "Jon Lunn", "Janet Sharples"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3501456.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["Hardcover Version", "PDF Version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure", "Science Fiction (Space Opera)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Modiphius Entertainment", "Spidermind Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpgseries": ["(Upcoming Releases)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3501456_t.jpg", "description": "<br/><br/><br/>    <br/>        <br/>UNRELEASED GAME<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        <br/>This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future.

However, despite the far-reaching consequences of its sinister presence, not all that much is known about The Beast. It falls to the PCs to investigate the nefarious being, learn more of its true nature, hunt it down, and, ultimately, slay it; all while contending with a terrified populace and a baron whose given himself over to madness, as well as discovering the true nature of a mysterious figure rumoured to be working alongside The Beast.

Advanced learners will love the counting game- a race to collect the most tokens by counting up and down from one to ten! With a device that makes colorful tokens appear like magic, Spin-a-roo keeps young learners excited about practicing their sorting and counting skills. There are two ways to play:<br/><br/><br/>    The Sorting Game (Green Side)*<br/><br/><br/>The goal is to collect the most Tokens by making color and number matches on your card. A player is chosen to turn the Spinner Handle and fill all seven slots in the Spinner Tray. The chosen player should crank the handle around in a circle until it is back on the starting position. When any player sees a token that matches any color or number on his/her card, he/she calls out the number, takes the token, and places it on the matching space on his/her card. When no player can make a match, or the seven slots in the tray are empty, the next player (moving clockwise) cranks the handle a full turn to reload the slots. When there are no tokens left in the spinner handle and no more matches can be made by any player, players stack all the tokens they have collected. If you are the player with the tallest stack--YOU WIN!<br/><br/><br/>    Counting Game (Purple Side)*<br/><br/><br/>The goal is to collect the most tokens by counting up and down from one to ten! A player is chosen to turn the handle and fill all seven slots in the spinner tray. They should crank the handle around in a circle one full turn until it is back on the starting position. When any player sees a token that comes before or after any number on his/her card, he/she calls out the number, takes the token, and places it on the correct space on his/her card. Any number may be placed on the &quot;WILD&quot; space to start. When no player can make a match, or the seven slots in the Tray are empty, the next player (moving clockwise) cranks the handle a full turn to reload the slots. If your stack reaches 10, clear that stack and start over. The tokens that you have cleared will be counted toward your total points at the end of the round. When there are no Tokens left in the Spinner Handle and no more matches can be made by any player, players stack all the Tokens they have collected.

Working together as a team, players must stabilize the global populations of amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles before time runs out or the damage done to the planet&rsquo;s biodiversity is beyond repair.<br/><br/>Using unique character skills, combined with team strategy and a bit of luck, players travel the globe encountering real-world destruction events and conservation strategies as they try to bring an end to the worldwide Extinction Crisis. The overall health of the global animal populations is tracked on the Population Growth Index (PGI) chart on the board. For victory, each animal population must be &ldquo;stabilized&rdquo; by raising its PGI marker above the zero value. The primary method to do this is for a player to successfully complete a Reaction card during their turn. These scientifically accurate cards are a major determining factor towards the team&rsquo;s overall success.<br/><br/>However, at the start of each player&rsquo;s turn an Occurrence Card is drawn. These cards guide the story and introduce real-world events and challenges that must be overcome. But be careful&hellip; Just when you think you&rsquo;re in the clear you could be hit with a Destruction Event, causing an entire species to become endangered or a local habitat to be destroyed. Other actions allow players to meet these challenges and progress towards their final objective. Players must also pay attention to the health of the world&rsquo;s waterways, invertebrates, and plants. Neglect any of the 3 main charts (PGI, IP, and Ocean) for too long and the consequences could be disastrous: a smart team balances the needs of all 3 charts continuously throughout the game to achieve victory.<br/><br/>Extinction Crisis presents players with a daunting task and requires them to find solutions, adapt to challenges, and overcome the very real crisis facing the planet.  With only 10 turns each, how will you rise to the occasion?<br/><br/>"}, "218861": {"rpgartist": ["Claudio Casini"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Little Kid", "rpgdesigner": ["Davide Pignedoli"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3371712.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Post Apocalypse)"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Apocalypse World"], "rpgpublisher": ["Daimon Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Apocalypse World Character Playbooks"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3371712_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>You are just a kid, probably less than ten years old, but you don't know for sure; you don't remember your parents, and have nobody to tell you when your birthday was.

Ripped away from a long age of peace and broken by soldiers wielding scientifically advanced weaponry, the warriors of the prefectures were drafted into a distant conflict across the edge of the world and ancient traditions of violence have reawakened a thirst for blood in those few that survive in the decaying world. Emperor Hitoshi&rsquo;s rebellion a decade ago threw down foreign rule but an ancient danger has reappeared to push society to the brink of collapse: the Mists of Akuma.<br/><br/>The corrupting fog transforms those within it into bloodthirsty adeddo-oni, monsters that seek only the rending of flesh and the taste of living meat. Nobles have retreated to the cities dotting the countryside leaving the common folk to face the supernatural haze alone, adding to the undead horde. Nature itself has been perilously wounded and the technology that might save the prefectures is shunned and feared by the Masuto Dynasty and Emperor Hitoshi&rsquo;s subjects.<br/><br/>Mists of Akuma is an eastern fantasy noir steampunk campaign setting for use with the newest edition of the world&rsquo;s most popular tabletop roleplaying game. Using new mechanics steeped in eastern lore, the book focuses on providing in-depth urban settings and a diverse array of character options to make truly unique parties of adventurers perfectly suited to survive the decay and desperation in Soburin. Bengoshi (governmental agents) empowered to deputize individuals in service of the Masuto Dynasty are attempting to hold the apocalypse at bay but intrigue and graft are as common and deadly as the corrupting fog, and the ancient threat&rsquo;s influence is spread all the further by the despair of Emperor Hitoshi&rsquo;s subjects.<br/><br/>In the 275 page Mists of Akuma rulebook you&rsquo;ll find...<br/><br/>    An overview of the recent history of Soburin and basic information about the world including the dangerous Mists of Akuma, rules for traveling the prefectures, and what rigors maddened explorers must overcome to visit the apocalypse that has become of the other continents.<br/>    Over 100 NPCs and monsters ranging from foreign generals to eastern dragons, powerful bengoshi and underlings from each of the 24 unique clans, and more than two dozen kami, oni, and tsukumogami!<br/>    Cultural practices and traditions for Soburin inspired by and drawn from eastern lore.<br/>    A chapter each detailing three different cities: the capital of the Imperial Prefecture, Sanbaoshi, the advanced mechanical metropolis of Kyofu, and the traditionalist magic-steeped settlement of Nagabuki.<br/>    Short stories with gorgeous half page illustrations at the start of each chapter to firmly posit the desperation and diversity inherent to adventuring in Soburin!<br/>    Details on each of the two dozen clans of the prefectures, including the bengoshi that negotiate on the behalf of each ruling family&rsquo;s lady or lord and how the Kengen Occupation affected each region of Soburin.<br/>    7 new character backgrounds and guidelines for adapting existing character backgrounds when playing in Soburin as well as new conditions, the Culture skill, and 6 maps for the continent and its settlements by cartographers Michael McCarthy, Mike Myler, and Tommi Salama!<br/>    19 different archetypes that provide exciting theme-appropriate character options for every class!

It will infect you, burrowing into your wounds and from thence into your soul.<br/><br/>It is through this fluid that the maligned sorcerers of our day summon the Purple Man. They cannot call the fiend up from the pits of Hell without a sacrifice, of course, but such is their villainy, these warlocks, that they lead their chosen victim into darkness to face the foul fluid alone and unprotected. Once claimed, they serve as a vessel for this violet-hued demoniac, their own soul lost to the heavens, cursed to wander fruitlessly and lamenting.<br/><br/>Do they even know how long they have, once the doom is upon them? I have seen it claim more than one brave and lawful adventurer in my time as well. They go to fight the hordes of chaos, but forget to tend to their own wounds, and then the mark of purple is seen upon them. Only the bravest self-immolate to spare their comrades the horror they know is to come. The others &mdash; they flinch, they stall for time, they hope in vain for a cure.<br/><br/>And then they become the Purple Man. There might be only one this time, or many. But they are all the same creature inside, for the Purple Man dwells inside the Abyss, and these horrific bodies are merely his fingertips, probing into our world. Take it from me, for I am a wizard, and I have studied these matters!<br/><br/>"}, "218927": {"rpgdesigner": ["Steven J.

Auto racing is one of these sports that will not die. But the rules no longer apply. The racing circuits are no longer about speed and guile. Now they resemble high speed demolition derbies. The most famous organized racing competition of them all, the Apocalypse Road, is run by callous thugs and monsters who encourage drivers to arm their cars and literally destroy their opponents. It is the Roman Coliseum reincarnated.<br/><br/>Over time, new rules and organizational structures have taken hold. Ten teams now complete across the Thunderverse in a season-long show of firepower and twisted metal. Drivers work as part of a team struggling to complete laps under machine gun and even missile fire. The tracks, falling into decades of disrepair, are a jumbled mess of jumps, joker lanes and dirt. Much like the gladiators of old, in a time of intense anguish, the chance to be a hero, even for a day, calls drivers out to risk life and limb for wealth and food. The arena beckons, will you take the wheel?<br/><br/>Apocalypse Road is a race game using the Thunder Alley/Grand Prix engine. Players attempt to score points by crossing the finish line (somewhat like roller derby) and by eliminating opposing cars. The first team to 15 points wins the event and gets a double portion of foodstuffs as a reward.<br/><br/>In Apocalypse Road, a race is played to the accumulation of 15 skins for a team. A Skin may be scored in two ways.<br/><br/>Each time a car crosses the Finish Line is worth 1 Skin.<br/>    Each opposing car that is eliminated during your activation is worth 1 Skin.<br/>    There is no leading and there is no tracking of lapped cars.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "First edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "name": "Apocalypse Road", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "age": "0"}, "218952": {"poll": [], "name": "Special Agent", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Commodore 64/128 release"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3518021.png", "videogametheme": ["Spy / Espionage"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Danish Designs"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["Commodore 64"], "average": "8.5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Firebird Silver 1.99"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3518021_t.png", "description": "From game manual<br/>Moskva 1988.
