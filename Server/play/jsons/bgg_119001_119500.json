The name is derived from the German words Beil (axe) and Tod (death). The odd spelling reflects Goodman's idea of a future language similar to A Clockwork Orange's Nadsat in which English has been modified by the borrowing of foreign words. Although the game may seem medieval, the backstory in the manual explains that the axe fighting is actually a future virtual reality game designed to reduce real violence.<br/><br/>The Bilestoad allows a human player to fight against either a computer-controlled opponent or another human. One can also pit two robots against each other. Movement and combat is accomplished with the keyboard, pressing keys to swing the gladiator's axe or shield outwards or inwards, or to make the gladiator turn, stop or walk. The game play is quite violent and bloody&mdash;players lop off their opponents' shield or sword arms, and dispatch them by decapitation.<br/><br/>The arena of combat is a small island, maps of which (at short, medium, and long range) are shown at the right side of the screen. Scattered around the arena are various objects, including yin/yang discs which players can stand on to accelerate their movement, stars that transport players to other points in the arena, and &quot;faces&quot; that allow players to leave the level. The game offers more strategic variation than many fighting games, letting the player run away and be chased around the island. The musical soundtrack begins with a bizarre, ponderous, off-key re-working of Beethoven's &quot;F&uuml;r Elise&quot;.<br/><br/>According to the author, influences for The Bilestoad include the movie Excalibur and Monty Python and the Holy Grail.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The Bilestoad&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "119014": {"videogame": ["Uncharted 2: Among Thieves Game of the Year Edition", "Uncharted 2: The Siege Expansion Pack", "Uncharted: Drake's Fortune"], "poll": [], "name": "Uncharted Dual Pack", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American PlayStation 3 edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1237807.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Uncharted"], "videogametheme": ["Folklore", "Nature / Jungle"], "videogamefranchise": ["Greatest Hits (Best Selling PlayStation Games, US)"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure", "Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 3"], "usersrated": "5", "average": "9.2", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "videogamecompilation": ["Uncharted 2: Among Thieves Game of the Year Edition", "Uncharted 2: The Siege Expansion Pack", "Uncharted: Drake's Fortune"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1237807_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Uncharted Greatest Hits Combo pack includes<br/> - Uncharted: Drakes Fortune Greatest Hits edition<br/> - Uncharted 2: Among Thieves Game of the Year edition<br/><br/>Also included is a Souper Voucher to redeem DLC bonus material for both Uncharted 2 and Uncharted 3.<br/><br/>"}, "119015": {"poll": [], "name": "Kujibiki Unbalance: Kaicho Onegai Smash Fight", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese PlayStation 2 edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Romance / Relationships"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Shade"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Marvelous Entertainment"], "description": "Kujibiki Unbalance: Kaich\u014d Onegai Smash Fight is based on the 2006 anime series of Kujibiki Unbalance.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Kujibiki Unbalance: Kaicho Onegai Smash Fight&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>Kujibiki&hearts;Unbalance (\u304f\u3058\u3073\u304d&hearts;\u30a2\u30f3\u30d0\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9 Kujibiki&hearts;Anbaransu), also referred to as Kujibiki &quot;Heart&quot; Unbalance in order to differentiate it from its original incarnation, is a 12-episode Fall 2006 anime series created by Shimoku Kio.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Kujibiki Unbalance (2006 series)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>In this relationship/adventure game, your 'liked' level determines how well you do in battle as much as the two girl allies you choose.

Action cards offer the ability to ally with spiders, wasps, catterpillers, and hornets to aid in your conquest but beware; there is a large glass eye in the sky that fries your warriors without notice!<br/><br/>Build your subterranean base as well and attack your opponent at will in this game of skill and strategy!  Each base will be different and no play-through will be the same!<br/><br/>"}, "119086": {"poll": [], "name": "Lettres Rummikub", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "1998", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": ["Rummikub"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1218107_t.jpg", "average": "4.2", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Parker Brothers"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1218107.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Word Game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Word Rummikub, with cards instead of tiles.

There are rules to four games using the cards.<br/><br/>Game 1: Qui, quoi, quand?<br/>A game for 2 players<br/>The cards are shuffled and placed in a stack in the centre of the table. On a turn, the player takes the top card and looks at the picture and the text on the other side of the card. From this, he or she must guess the correct historical period for the card e.g. L&eacute;onard de Vinci would be a La Renaissance card. Then check the summary card. If correct, he scores a point. If not, the card is discarded and the opponent has a turn. When all the cards have been used, the one with the most points, wins.<br/><br/>Game 2: L'ordre chronologique<br/>Cards are dealt out evenly. The remaing cards are placed in a stack. A card is revealed and the player must lay a card that goes immediately before the date on that card or just after it. If you cannot play a card, you must pass and take a card from the stack and add it to your hand. The first player to use all their cards, wins.<br/><br/>Game 3: Qui suis-je?<br/>Stack all the cards with only the picture side showing. Each player, in turn, takes the top card and tries to name the event, person, etc. The card is then turned over to reveal the text. If the player is correct, he keeps the card. If not, it is discared. The player with the most cards when the stack is emptied, wins.<br/><br/>Game 4: 9 Familles<br/>The cards are colour coded so a straightforward version of 7 Familles/Happy Families can be played. Each set collected is worth one point for every card in that set. When all the sets are played out, the winner is the one with the most points.<br/><br/>"}, "119088": {"poll": [], "name": "Bluff", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1218114_t.jpg", "average": "4.43333", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Spear's Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1218114.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Spears Green First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Children's Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Card game with a lot of bluffing involved.<br/><br/>Rules (as written on the back of the box)<br/><br/>The object of the game is, by bluffing, to be the first player to dispose of all his cards.<br/>The cards are shuffled and dealt to all the players. The player to the left of the dealer begins by placing one card face down onto the centre of the table and names its picture, for example saying &quot;flower&quot;. The next player puts a card on top of it also saying &quot;flower&quot;, this is when the bluffing comes in. Each player in his turn has to claim to lay the same picture as that which was started with whether he has one or not. Play continues in this way until the call comes back to the player who started the round. He calls again the name of the picture he started with and lays a card. This is the end of that round. The next player starts a new round by placing a card on top of the cards already on the table (if any) and names the same or a different picture.<br/>Any time a player thinks another player is bluffing he may challenge him. If he is in fact bluffing and has not laid the card he said, he has to pick up all the cards on the table and add them to his hand. If he was not bluffing the challenger has to pick up all the cards.<br/><br/>"}, "119090": {"poll": [], "name": "Lustige Autofahrt", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "1935", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1218976_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Otto Maier Verlag", "Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1218976.png", "boardgameversion": ["Ravensburger Edition 1935", "Second wooden cars edition", "Third Edition", "Third edition (plastic cars)"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Racing"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Objective: be the first making the fastest lap<br/> - moving by turn - <br/>each player moves according 1d6 roll; ending on a marked space follow instructions printed on cover inside.<br/>Last space must be reached with matching number - surplus movement points push you backwards.<br/>remarks: <br/>republished 1955 - still the same artist (board) Scheer (prename unknown)<br/><br/>"}, "119092": {"poll": [], "name": "O for a Word", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "4", "yearpublished": "1935", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "24", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1218118_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["G.

Someone&mdash;or something&mdash;is stalking and killing worshipers of Sarenrae, the goddess of the sun. The city guard is prepared to ambush the murderer, but they need help&mdash;help of the kind that adventurers are so good at providing. What is the sinister truth behind these violent acts?<br/><br/>Dawn of the Scarlet Sun is a Pathfinder RPG adventure for six 5th-level characters&mdash;such as the six iconic heroes provided. In addition, this adventure can be integrated into the Shattered Star Pathfinder Adventure Path, and uses the villains featured in the Pathfinder Battles Champions of Evil Encounter Pack.<br/><br/>This special 16-page Pathfinder Module will initially be made available for Free RPG Day on June 16, 2012.

The guards are baffled, people huddle in their homes, and whispers spread of the death delivered on dark wings.  Desperate for aid, the city watch turns to bold adventurers, revealing more of the murders' gruesome details and bringing the heroes in on a daring plan to catch the killer - a plot that makes them a tempting target for the maniac's bloody knife.  This dangerous ploy sets the heroes on a path fraught with savage creatures, decades-old secrets, and the dark desires of an immortal evil that seeks to pervert a forgotten house of worship.  Will they be able to put an end to the slaughter?  Or will all of Magnimar drown in the rising tide of blood?<br/><br/>Dawn of the Scarlet Sun is an adventure for 5th-level characters, written for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and compatible with the 35 edition of the world's oldest RPG.<br/><br/>"}, "119117": {"rpgdesigner": ["Stefan Bogdanski", "Myron B\u00fcnnagel", "Thomas Echelmeyer", "Julia Erdmann", "Sven Flottmann", "David Grade", "David Grashoff", "Michael Junker", "Reinhard Kotz", "Thomas Losleben", "Fabian W.

Using contract clauses, you can usually pick the player up for a cheaper transfer fee than what you would if you didn't use a contract clause, but after you've used all four and try to use another, it will say that the club who the player currently plays for cannot afford to let him go. Once you sell anyone you have used with a contract clause, you may then buy a player using another contract clause.<br/><br/>After the third-party conversion of LMA Professional Manager 2005, a second PC version was being developed by Codemasters themselves and was scheduled for release in Spring 2006 alongside the first seventh-generation iteration on Xbox 360.

Here are the different types of cards in the game:<br/><br/><br/>    Green-backed cards = These cards give special responsibilities to the player who holds Agent P or Dr. Doofenshmirtz. For example &quot;Say 'Ahh, Perry the Platypus!' before you start your turn. If you forget, you turn is over!&quot; These cards also give the indicated player an extra penalty or bonus. For example &quot;You may play 1 extra card.&quot; A new green-backed card is flipped over and takes effect whenever the Agent P or Dr. Doofenshmirtz character moves to another player.<br/>    Blue-backed Character Cards = These cards move the characters around. For instance &quot;Take 1 character from another player.&quot;<br/>    Blue-backed Power Cards = These cards give you special card-play powers. For instance &quot;Take 1 random card from each player.&quot;<br/>    Blue-backed Challenge Cards = These cards allow you to do weird challenges against other players. For instance &quot;Challenge another player to a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. If you win, take up to 3 random cards from the other player.<br/>    Blue-backed Scene Cards = These cards are how you score points. If you have the character(s) shown on the card you can play it for the number of points indicated on the card. For instance the &quot;Unfair Science Fair&quot; card is worth 10 points if you currently hold Baljeet.<br/>    Blue-backed Special Cards = The Mom card forces everyone to discard everything and draw 3 new cards.

Through their continued growth and expansion they have discovered many ancient ruins of a time long past.  It was within one such set of these ruins that an expedition of explorers from Kazdim uncovered, and released, an unspeakable horror.  A dread so unimaginable the ancients themselves imprisoned it over a thousand years ago.  This evil has a name... Necrath, The Ice Duke.<br/><br/>In the decade and a half that has passed since this wicked scourge was loosed upon the land, strange, dark, and violent events have taken place.  Sinister books and scrolls of vile evil and black magic have been discovered, and have twisted the minds of those foolish enough to read them.  Raiding parties of wittershin have set out from the mountains to wreak havoc and destruction upon men.  These assaults were followed by a full scale war led by the mighty race of rephaim, from whom the conflict was so named, the War of the Giants.<br/><br/>It has been seven years since the War of the Giants ended, and the nations of men have slowly been recovering from their staggering losses.  A keep has been constructed to maintain vigil over the mountain pass, should the enemy ever decide to rear its ugly head again.  All would appear to be calm, for now. But appearances are deceiving, for deep within the mountains that same evil so recently released is stirring yet again.<br/><br/>Illfrost: Bondage represents the first step into the Illfrost Adventure Path, which will ultimately span 30 levels.

A pandemic is sweeping the globe. At first, scientists believe it to be yet another wave of the Spanish Flu. In the disease&rsquo;s early stages, patients present with high fever, vomiting, and weakness. Quickly, the Spanish Flu theory comes under scrutiny. Patients all report having been attacked. Where the disease spreads violent crime seems to inexplicably rise. As outbreaks skyrocket, several studies conclusively prove the disease in not the dreaded Spanish Flu; it is something much worse. Late stage symptoms are found to include death, reanimation, superhuman strength, and an insatiable craving for human flesh.<br/><br/>After precious few years of peace, the nations of the world are returning once more to the trenches, united against a common foe. In Zombies &amp; Zeppelins, 2-4 players lead the forces of humanity against hordes of the undead. Together, players must attempt to clear the numerous infested cities around the world. Should they fail, mankind will be swept away in a tide of the damned.<br/><br/>Zombies &amp; Zeppelins is played on a game board depicting a map of the world which has been divided into 25 regions. The game uses a card-driven system to determine both the spread of the undead and humanity's military capacity. Player's must carefully manage their meager resources in combating the undead. Through clever maneuvering of their infantry, armor and artillery, and a little bit of luck, players might just be able to avert Armageddon.<br/><br/>"}, "119320": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["1st Edition Preview Copy"], "statistics": [], "name": "Tefr:  Knowledge is Power", "rpgdesigner": ["Simon Cornish"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1221388.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpg": ["Tefr"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1221388_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher's description:<br/><br/>Knowledge is Power is a full resource for Tefr narrators running role playing scenarios set in the Tefr World.

This degenerates as the plot advances, and the main character is eventually forced to use guns and other tools in several endgame action sequences.<br/><br/>Its interface consists of a point-and-click system similar to the one used by Sierra Entertainment games, such as the Gabriel Knight series. There is an inventory screen that appears if the user drags the pointer to the upper side of the screen. The game's engine looks similar to Clock Tower 2 (Clock Tower in North America), with a few minor alterations.<br/><br/>Clock Tower Ghost Head features three chapters whose length can change depending on the choices made by the player. The game's replay value comes mostly in its 13 endings, which normally portray the main character dying in different violent ways.

However there were uprisings and armies in conflict in Eastern Europe, especially in the newly created Duchy of Warsaw.<br/>La Bataille de Raszyn depicts the major battle between the VII Austrian Armeekorps and the Polish Forces defending Warsaw. The invasion force commanded by Archduke Ferdinand d&rsquo;Este drives toward the capital of Poland being defended by General Poniatowski.  Poniatowski decides to defend a crucial river crossing that has limited crossings and swampy ground.<br/><br/>The forces of Poniatowski are limited as much of the Polish forces are fighting in Spain. His available forces have excellent morale being highly motivated to defend a country once partitioned by Austrian, Prussia and Russia. A contingent of Saxons assist the Polish Army and scenarios add a variety of forces from neighboring areas.<br/><br/>D&rsquo; Este &lsquo;Austrian&rsquo; Army is in fact made up of infantry from Hungary and Galician (Poland), with Grenz (border) troops and a sizable number of elite cavalry. Although this army outnumbers the forces of Poniatowski, it may lack the motivation and leadership of their counterpoints. The Austrian Army&rsquo;s tactics include some of the recent reforms and traditional formations. Option rules and scenarios provide for a number of &lsquo;what ifs&rdquo; and fresh simulations<br/><br/>Each 20 minute turn starts with a Command Phase for both sides followed by the French Player sequence and then by the Prussian Player sequence. The sequence includes movement, cavalry charges, fire and melee. During each, morale plays a decisive role. This is a great one player on one player game that can be completed in an afternoon. In addition to the historical game there are two scenarios that vary the orders of battle and appearance times.<br/>The original rules have been updated but not expanded to any extent. The original designers of the La Bataille Series believe the Premier Rules facilitate the most accurate and competitive play. The new Premier Rules are an update of the original  rules but make it easier to find specific topics and includes some user requested rules such as command control.<br/>Marshal Enterprises intends to publish a Napoleonic Grand Tactical Game every quarter.

To achieve this, they send out their family members to locations in Tuscany to perform various tasks, specifically to recruit followers (knights, assassins, abbots) and collect money as both are needed to take control of provinces in neighboring regions; controlled provinces provide power and a bonus action. Another task is to gain the favor of the squirearchy as these favors are indispensable when it comes to getting an official position in Florence, e.g., a seat on the town council to enhance actions in Tuscany, or a noble rank to gain power at the end of the game.<br/><br/>To complete these tasks, however, a proper middleman must be present at a location, and as these middlemen travel a lot, they are rarely met. That's why it is so important to have one's family members in the right place at the right time &ndash; to save on time and money while achieving one's goals.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player has four family members in Tuscany. Players take turns performing exactly one action. Before his action, a player may pay money to move one of his own family members to another location. The available actions are to:<br/><br/><br/>    Take a location-specific action in Tuscany. This requires both a middleman and one of your own standing (active) family members at that location. After the action, this family member is laid down (inactive).<br/>    Travel to another region and take over a province, which costs both followers and money.<br/>    Travel to Florence where you'll spend scrolls (and possibly money) to claim a city council or nobility tile.<br/>    Introduce a new family member to the board.<br/>    Raise all lying family members on the board.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends when the &quot;Power of the Medici&quot; has faded, as indicated by a diminishing pile of crest tiles.

Combat is one-on-one set in best-two-out-of-three rounds.<br/><br/>It uses a &quot;tension&quot; gauge, akin to Street Fighter Alpha's Super Combo techniques, in which characters can input certain commands and activate special-moves called Chaos Attacks. It also features an air-combo system, comparable to Marvel vs. Capcom's &quot;Aerial Rave&quot;, allowing combos to be performed on airborne opponents.<br/><br/>Guilty Gear features instant kill techniques called Destroy Attacks, that can be activated after a Murder Outbreak attack successfully lands on an opponent, effectively ending the match.<br/><br/>The game also has a feature called Chaos Mode that is activated when a character's health is at the half-way point (yellow bar).

Games in these categories are relatively rare (Tablan, Puluc, and Daldos being virtually the only other known examples).<br/><br/>The game is played on a board with 4 rows and anywhere from 7 to 15 columns.  One player fills the bottom row with playing pieces; the other player fills the top row with his or her pieces.  Four casting sticks are used to randomly generate moves for the pieces.  The two center rows of the board are treated as a looping track along which pieces move linearly in a counter-clockwise direction once leaving their home row. It is primarily on these two central rows that the battles take place, with a piece capturing an opponent piece by landing on its square.

Introducing ACQUAINT&trade; - the revolutionary &quot;real deal&quot; card game that helps first-, second-, or even third-time daters get better acquainted. It was designed not only to create conversation and calm nerves, but to also help daters better determine each other's &quot;keeper&quot; potentials; needless to say, finding out early on whether or not they are truly compatible may prove to be a time-saving, preventative measure of future heartache.<br/><br/>This highly interactive card game includes questions, tasks, lessons and more! It encourages 'authentic' conversation through the sharing of thoughts, experiences, feelings and values. Questions range from light-hearted topics to semi-personal and serious, and fun &quot;off-the-wall&quot; topics are included throughout.<br/><br/>OBJECT: Collect as many Rose Cards in your hand as you can by discarding as many other cards as possible. Players perform any task(s) listed on the discarded card on each turn. There are a total of 9 Rose Cards, and the player with the most in their hand at the end wins. The main point of the game, however, is for the players to get to know one another better.<br/><br/>CARDS: Includes 52 cards total <br/><br/>     9 ROSE CARDS<br/>     20 'REAL DEAL' QUESTION CARDS <br/>     4 FILL-IN-THE-BLANK CARDS<br/>     6 DISCUSSION CARDS<br/>     5 SCALE (&quot;What # Are You?&quot;) CARDS<br/>     6 MISCELLANEOUS CARDS ('Listening Check' Card, 'Deception Destroyer' Card 'Share' Card, 'Flirt' Card, 'Deal Breaker' Card, &amp; 'Compromise' Card) <br/>     2 PROTECTION CARDS<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>START: SHUFFLE CARDS WELL before starting (keeping all the cards facing the same direction). Choose which player will go first. Players must also choose in advance the level of play preferred for the 'REAL DEAL' Questions from the three levels listed below.<br/><br/>REAL DEAL QUESTION CARD LEVELS: <br/><br/>     LEVEL 1 ('a' questions) - Simple, light-hearted questions to learn a little about your date - questions that are generally easy to answer and don't take that much thought<br/>     LEVEL 2 ('b' questions) - Moderate get-to-know-your-date questions - questions that get a little more serious, where people can reveal a bit more about themselves<br/>     LEVEL 3 ('c' questions) - Deep questions designed to create a bonding emotional connection, or, to better spot potential 'RED FLAGS' in advance--ideal for 'bold' daters. Keep in mind DISHONESTY CAN DESTROY EVEN THE BEST OF RELATIONSHIPS! PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK! Warning: Some questions may be considered to some as personally inappropriate for a new date, even though the questions are in good taste. (The reason someone may pass on a question need not be explained -- besides, a little mystery can often prove to be an effective strategy as well.)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>PLAY: Each person is dealt 7 cards (one at a time) face down. The remaining cards are placed face down in a pile in the center of the table, forming the draw pile (or the Selection Pile). The first player (aka THE DISCARDER) takes a turn by drawing the top card from the Selection Pile followed by choosing a card to discard from his/her hand, reading it out loud first. Players then respond to any directions from the card accordingly. When finished, the DISCARDER places the card face up right alongside the Selection Pile, into what will be the Discard Pile (unless otherwise directed). Similarly, the other player then takes their turn, and so on.<br/><br/>SCORING: The game ends as soon as soon as the last card is picked up/discarded. The players then count the number of Rose Cards in their hands, and the player with the most roses wins. (If both players end up without any roses, it's considered a tie game.).<br/><br/>"}, "119446": {"rpgdesigner": ["Ewen Cluney"], "rpg": ["Mascot-tan"], "poll": [], "name": "Mascot-tan", "rpgartist": ["Thinh Pham"], "rpgproducer": ["Ewen Cluney"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1223752.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Animation / Comics (Anime / Manga)", "Culture (Asian / Far Eastern)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Distant Star Games", "Yaruki Zero Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpgseries": ["Kyawaii RPG Series"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1223752_t.jpg", "description": "From designer's website:<br/>Mascot-tan<br/><br/>A Roleplaying Game About<br/>The Cute, Disturbing Adventures<br/>Of Cute, Disturbed Little Girls<br/><br/>Mascot-tan is a weird little RPG where the players take on the roles of anime/manga mascot girls, in the vein of Habanero-tan and the OS Girls, and have wacky little adventures.

The original version (model SCPH-1010) was released alongside the PlayStation on December 3, 1994.<br/><br/>Based on the basic button configuration established with Nintendo's Super NES Controller, the PlayStation Controller added a second pair of shoulder buttons for the middle fingers. Intended to update the gamepad for navigating 3D environments such as the ones PlayStation was designed to generate, the concept behind featuring shoulder buttons for both the index and middle fingers was to implement two-way directional depth controls using the two sets of buttons. To compensate for the less stable grip from shifting the middle fingers' placement to the shoulders, grip handles were added to the controller.<br/><br/>Using the simple geometric shapes Triangle, Circle, Cross, and Square to label its action buttons rather than traditionally used letters or numbers, the PlayStation Controller established a trademark which would be incorporated heavily into the PlayStation brand. In an interview with Teiyu Goto, designer of the original Playstation Controller, he explains what the symbols mean. The circle and x represent yes and no respectively, the triangle symbolizes a point of view and the square is equated to a sheet of paper there to be used to access menus.<br/><br/>On April 2, 1996, Sony released a revised version of the PlayStation Controller (model SCPH-1080), featuring a longer cord with a ferrite bead. After briefly selling the Dual Analog Controller in 1997, Sony began phasing out the PlayStation Controller later that year with the introduction of the DualShock controller, which would become the new standard controller for the PlayStation.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;PlayStation Controller&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "119490": {"statistics": [], "name": "PlayStation Memory Card", "usersrated": "4", "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1546336.jpg", "videogamehwversion": ["Black Sony PlayStation Memory Card", "Emerald Green Sony PlayStation Memory Card", "Gray Sony PlayStation Memory Card", "Island Blue Sony PlayStation Memory Card", "Lemon Yellow Sony PlayStation Memory Card", "Transparent Sony PlayStation Memory Card"], "videogamehardwarecategory": ["Memory Card"], "average": "6.125", "videogamehardware": ["PlayStation"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1546336_t.jpg", "videogamehwmfg": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "description": "The original memory card for the Playstation holds 128 kB of space in an EEPROM.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;PlayStation (console)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "119491": {"poll": [], "name": "Double Fine Happy Action Theater", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Xbox 360 XBLA edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Other"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Double Fine Productions"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade", "Party"], "videogameplatform": ["Xbox 360"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Microsoft Game Studios"], "description": "Happy Action Theater is an open-ended game, providing eighteen different modes that incorporate features of the Kinect motion-sensing and camera system.
