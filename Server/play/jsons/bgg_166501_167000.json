The game serves as a deconstructive satire of social games. The goal of the game is to earn &quot;clicks&quot; by clicking on a sprite of a cow every six hours. The addition of friends' cows to the player's pasture allows the user to also receive &quot;clicks&quot; whenever the player's cow is clicked. A premium currency known as &quot;Mooney&quot; allows the user to purchase different cow designs and skip the six-hour interval between clicks.<br/><br/>In the wake of a controversial speech by Zynga's president at the Game Developers Choice Awards in 2010, Bogost developed Cow Clicker for a presentation at a New York University seminar on social gaming in July 2010. The game was created to demonstrate what Bogost felt were the most commonly abused mechanics of social games, such as the promotion of social interaction and monetization rather than the artistic aspects of the medium. As the game unexpectedly began to grow in popularity, Bogost also used Cow Clicker to parody other recent gaming trends, such as gamification, educational apps, and alternate reality games.<br/><br/>Cow Clicker received positive reception from critics and users, who praised the game for its dissection of the common mechanics of social network games and viewed it as a commentary on how social games affect people.<br/><br/>The player is initially given a pasture with nine slots and a single plain cow, which the player may click once every six hours. Each time the cow is clicked, a point also known as a &quot;click&quot; is awarded; if the player adds friends' cows to their pasture, they also receive clicks added to their scores when the player clicks their own cow. As in other Facebook games, players are encouraged to post announcements to their news feed whenever they click their cow. A virtual currency known as &quot;Mooney&quot; can be bought with Facebook Credits; it can be used to purchase special &quot;premium&quot; cow designs, and the ability to skip the six-hour time limit that must be waited before the cow can be clicked again.<br/><br/>At the 2010 Game Developers Conference, Zynga's game FarmVille was awarded the &quot;Best New Social/Online Game&quot; at its Game Developers Choice Awards. Ian Bogost (who was also in attendance) was critical of Zynga's success, as he felt that its business model was focused on convincing users to pay money to progress further in their &quot;freemium&quot; games rather than treating gaming as an artistic experience. He also believed Zynga's vice president Bill Mooney was trying to attack &quot;artistic&quot; gaming during his acceptance speech for the award when he personally invited independent game developers to join his company.[3] After the conference, Bogost coined the term &quot;cow clickers&quot; to describe games such as FarmVille which only involve performing tasks at certain intervals, since in these games, &quot;you click on a cow, and that&rsquo;s all you do.&quot; Bogost compared the players of Zynga's games to the rats in B. F. Skinner's operant conditioning experiment, often receiving variable reinforcement rather than regular rewards. As one of the most vocal critics of Zynga's practices and business model, Bogost made further appearances at various events and panels to discuss his views on social gaming.<br/><br/>In July 2010, Bogost was scheduled to make an appearance at a New York University seminar, &quot;Social Games On Trial&quot;, to discuss the controversial aspects of social network gaming. To clearly demonstrate what he felt were the most commonly abused mechanics of these games, Bogost quickly developed a Facebook game entitled Cow Clicker. The game was designed to be a satire of what Bogost personally believed were the only points of FarmVille: to encourage users to continue playing by inviting other users into the game, and to provide incentives for those who purchase virtual goods.<br/><br/>Unexpectedly to Bogost, Cow Clicker became a viral phenomenon, amassing over 50,000 players by September 2010&mdash;many of whom understood the game's meaning and used it as a symbol of objection to Zynga's practices. In response to its sudden popularity, he committed to improving the game with new features. Updates to the game added awards for reaching certain milestones (such as the Golden Cowbell for 100,000 clicks), the ability to earn Mooney by clicking on other users' Cow Clicker news feed posts, and the chance to randomly gain or lose Mooney on every click. New cow designs were also introduced, such as an oil-coated cow to commemorate the BP oil spill, and the &quot;Stargrazer Cow&quot;, which was only a mirror image of the original cow that cost around $20 US worth of Mooney.<br/><br/>Although continually disturbed by its popularity, Bogost also used Cow Clicker to parody other recent gaming and social networking trends; such as the addition of an API to allow websites to have their own clickable cows (in a process he dubbed &quot;Cowclickification&quot;), the spin-off game Cow Clicker Blitz (co-developed with PopCap Games co-founder Jason Kapalka), &quot;My First Cow Clicker&quot; for iOS (a parody of simplistic education apps; designed to &quot;train&quot; children on cow clicking and add the resulting clicks to their parent's total), and a &quot;Cow Clicktivism&quot; campaign where users could click on an emaciated cow to donate to Oxfam America&mdash;with a goal of donating an actual cow to a third world country. The cow, known as the &quot;Cowclicktivist Cow&quot;, could also be unlocked for the player's pasture with a $110 donation.<br/><br/>In 2011, an alternate reality game known as the &quot;Cow ClickARG&quot; was held, where a series of clues from the &quot;bovine gods&quot; eventually revealed that a &quot;Cowpocalypse&quot; would occur on July 21, 2011 (exactly one year since the original release of the game). From then on, every click made by players would deduct thirty seconds from a countdown clock leading to the Cowpocalypse. However, players could extend the countdown clock by paying to supplicate with Facebook Credits: paying 10 credits would extend the countdown by a single hour, while 4,000 would extend the countdown by an entire month.[5] After $700 worth of extensions, the countdown clock expired on the evening of September 7, 2011. At this point, the game remained playable, but all the cows were replaced by blank spaces and said to have been raptured. Bogost intended the Cowpocalypse event to signal the &quot;end&quot; of the game to players; when addressing a complaint by a fan who felt the game was no longer fun after the cow rapture, Bogost responded that &quot;it wasn't very fun before.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Cow Clicker&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "166503": {"poll": [], "name": "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative"], "videogameversion": ["Android edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2702499.png", "videogametheme": ["Crime"], "usersrated": "39", "videogamedeveloper": ["Steel Crate Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Party", "Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "Windows"], "videogamehonor": ["2015 Golden Geek Best PC Game Nominee", "2015 Golden Geek Most Innovative Video Game Nominee", "2015 IGF Awards Excellence in Design Nominee", "2015 Proto Awards Best Gameplay of the Year Nominee", "2015 Proto Awards Best Overall Experience of the Year Nominee", "2015 Proto Awards Best Social Experience of the Year Winner", "2015 Proto Awards Most Innovative Game of the Year Winner", "2015 SXSW Best Indie Game of the Year Nominee", "2016 A MAZE.

Therefore, one day, the Angel told Pinocchio: &quot;If you can finish an adventure on your own without telling any lies and detect the lies of the others in the journey, you will become a 'real' boy.&quot; Can Pinocchio eventually become a real boy and live happily ever after with the Carpenter?<br/><br/>Pinocchio: True or False is an enlightening and bonding storytelling game. A player draws a subject card, chooses one of the four subjects on the card, decides whether the story she is going to tell will be true or just a lie, then begins her story. The other players listen to the story to judge its veracity. After the story has been told, the one who grabs the Pinocchio doll first can ask the storyteller a question, which the storyteller must answer honestly &mdash; unless her story is a lie, of course, in which case she can say what she wants.<br/><br/>Each player then secretly votes on whether or not the story was a lie. Those who guess incorrectly must take a wooden nose block and make Pinocchio's nose grow by stacking their block onto his ever-lengthening nose. When a player places the nose block, the tree rings on the block must be fully covered and not visible. If any blocks fall, whoever caused this gets an &quot;Angel Token&quot;. When a player gets his third angel token, the game ends after this round, and the player with the fewest angel tokens win.<br/><br/>In order to make gameplay more challenging, if half or more players guess correctly as to whether the story is or isn't true, the storyteller must also add a block to the nose.

It is the sequel to Valhalla Knights 2 and is the third game in the Valhalla Knights video game series. The game was originally planned to be released in Japan on January 31, 2013, but was delayed, and eventually was released on May 23, 2013. XSEED Games published the game in North America on October 15, 2013, and Europe on October 23, 2013.[3] An enhanced version of the game titled Valhalla Knights 3 Gold (\u30f4\u30a1\u30eb\u30cf\u30e9\u30ca\u30a4\u30c43 Gold?) was released in Japan on February 27, 2014; however, XSEED Games announced that they have no plans to release Gold in other regions.<br/><br/>The player creates a battle team and then can challenge other players in a 7-on-7 battle. The game features seven character races, which are Human, Elf, Hobbit, Dwarf, Nightmare, Beast and Machine, and seven character classes, which are Fighter, Mage, Prisoner, Thief, Priest, Akatoki, and Archer.[5] Each character also has eight &quot;active&quot; skills and four &quot;passive&quot; skills, the skills depending on the character type. Additionally, there are also different personality traits, which are given at random to a character. The character's personality influences their behavior. By winning, the player obtains arena points which can be used to buy weapons and armor. The game also features a &quot;red light district&quot; where the player can recruit female party members by paying them then raising their affection, as well as trigger side-quests. The player must also earn skill points, which are necessary to upgrade and unlock abilities for his/her team.<br/><br/>Valhalla Knights 3 uses real-time battle system which allows the player-controlled protagonist to instruct other characters. Enemy leaders are also in charge of ordering their party; thus if the player takes down the leader the other enemies will become easier to kill. However, less experience is gained that way. In XSEED Games' version, online multiplayer is supported (as opposed to the ad-hoc connectivity of the original release); the gameplay has also been made easier. The game also features downloadable content, including character costumes from the No-Rin anime and light novel series.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Valhalla Knights 3&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "166582": {"poll": [], "name": "Saint Seiya: Brave Soldiers", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese PlayStation 3 edition", "PSN PlayStation 3 Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Saint Seiya"], "videogametheme": ["Martial Arts"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Dimps"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 3"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Namco Bandai Games Inc."], "description": "Saint Seiya: Brave Soldiers (\u8056\u95d8\u58eb\u661f\u77e2 \u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30d6\u30fb\u30bd\u30eb\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u30ba Seinto Seiya Bureibu Soruj\u0101zu?) is a video game developed by Dimps and Namco Bandai Games featuring the characters and story of Masami Kurumada's Saint Seiya manga.

The project leader of the game is Brad Muir, who was previously the project leader of Iron Brigade. An alpha version was released at the end of 2014. The completed version was released June 1, 2015.<br/><br/>The goal of Massive Chalice is to defend a land against invading forces for 300 years. The defense force consists of heroes. Since heroes tend to live for about 70 years, the player needs to set up &quot;bloodlines&quot;, families that regularly produce heroes. By &quot;breeding&quot; families with good traits, strong heroes can be produced. Major decisions for the player encompass whether to use a hero as breeding stock (taking him or her out of the defense pool) or for their combat abilities. The heroes that do best in combat may earn a nickname for themselves, and if they were using a basic weapon during their career, that weapon may become a relic, a family heirloom that possesses special features and is passed on to future generations.<br/><br/>In May 2013, Massive Chalice became the focus of Double Fine's second Kickstarter campaign, after Broken Age (formerly known as Double Fine Adventure) in 2012. The Double Fine team had learned from their mistakes on the first kickstarter and opted to not show as much exclusive material to backers, as this created a rift between the backers and non-backers, as well as members of the press. Kickstarter backers influenced the development of the game when the ability for same sex marriage was added to the game after a number of requests. Brad Muir stated that backer input before development was one of the advantages of Kickstarter, since a feature such as this might not have been thought about until the game was almost completed, making it harder to implement. He also went on to state that if the game was made under a traditional publisher agreement, the publisher might not have allowed the feature to be added to the game in order to avoid controversy.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Massive Chalice&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "166603": {"rpgartist": ["Savannah Burgess", "Jonathan Cook", "Michael C.

Crusader 2 will recapture the original game&rsquo;s addictive, fast-paced gameplay and authentic castle simulation. True to its roots this new Stronghold will define old school real time strategy, combining RTS and city builder gameplay. Playing as a brutal Crusader Knight or Arabic freedom fighter, you must use a deadly array of troops and destructive siege equipment to decide the fate of the holy lands.

Since launch Crusader has sold over two million copies, with over 3000 user-made maps still in circulation on one Stronghold fansite and fans still playing the game today. Recently Stronghold Crusader HD gave the game a new lease of life, offered as a free update for existing owners of the game and made available for purchase on GOG and Steam. Crusader 2 has been on the mind of Lead Designer Simon Bradbury since the release of Stronghold Crusader in 2002. It is only now, having become a fully independent studio, that Firefly feel comfortable delivering a worthy sequel to their fans&rsquo; favourite game. As a developer their mission is to recapture the addictive, intense gameplay that made the original Crusader a classic.

Let me explain every word in the previous sentence.<br/><br/>Hardcore<br/><br/>Full loot, free PvP, assets destruction during sieges and raids, complex crafting and no target combat systems. These are just some of features that makes our game rather hardcore then casual &quot;theme park&quot; MMORPG.<br/><br/>Sandbox<br/><br/>Sandbox means that our goal is to design virtual world with its own set of mechanisms and rules that will let players to do anything within our world that their imagination desires. Like a real sandbox, with some sand, some tools and your hands you can do, whatever you want &ndash; dig a tunnels, shovel moats, build castles and raise hills.<br/><br/>These are the exact same things you will be able to do in our game: you can shape terrain in any way you like, such as raise ground, lower ground, flatten it for further building placements, dig tunnels, even find ore veins and mine them. You can build whole underground cities, as you are not limited with width or height of your tunnels. You can make a huge pyramid with your friends and dig a maze inside of it just for fun. Only limitation is your imagination! Please watch our pre-alpha videos to get a look at these aspects of the game in more detail.<br/><br/>If you don&rsquo;t want to dwell underground you can make a home for yourself, a whole village, town or even a castle. You can also make it sandbox-style. We will let you build whole castle walls with sections, allowing you to build it however you like. Who knows, maybe you will be the first one to build the Great Wall in our world. Same goes for buildings &ndash; you can either choose to use preset buildings (such as windmills, warehouses, keeps etc.) or design your own multistory building square by square and build them however you like.<br/><br/>MMORPG<br/><br/>MMORPG stands for massively multi-player online role-playing game. This means, that you won&rsquo;t be alone in your sandbox, there will be many more other players that will be aiding you further your own goals,  or working against you to further their own, all the time shaping our virtual world. It also means that there will be an RPG system, based on: statcap and skillcap concepts (UO style), alignment and a rich crafting system spiced with an innovative flash minigames concept.<br/><br/>Realistic-fictional world<br/><br/>This means that we are inspired by the medieval ages (since fall of Rome till gunpowder in Europe) and representing this time period with as much realism as possible, this is our focus as we approach every aspect of our game building process. However on the other hand, story, race archetypes, some equipment and items are fictional. Religion is more powerful in our world, allowing some localized wonders to appear or giving powers to players to recall back home or protect their divine private property from vandals. So it&rsquo;s neither a historical simulation game with 100% authenticity, nor we will have elves or orcs in game. It is a hybrid of the two, leaning more towards realism.<br/><br/>Only part of that sentence left unexplained is &ldquo;indie project&rdquo;.  We have grown from enthusiasts to indie state by managing to achieve few investments from non gamedeveloping/publishing entities, which allows us to work fulltime and with full force on our project, but without influence on game design and development processes from outside. And that's cool! Trust me ;)<br/><br/>Currently we&rsquo;re in closed alpha stage. This means that we have a lot of different functionality done, but we still have a lot of work to do.<br/><br/>Taken from the Game website<br/><br/>"}, "166655": {"rpgdesigner": ["Robert Gresham"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "statistics": [], "name": "Players Races Series: Oyapok", "rpgartist": ["Robert Gresham"], "rpgproducer": ["Robert Gresham"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2254873.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgsetting": ["Shattered Skies"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Animal (Anthropomorphic)", "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Wayward Rogues Publishing"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2254873_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Deep in the swamps of Celmae live the Oyapok- a small, semi-aquatic race of marsupial humanoids.

The deck of 110 cards consists of production buildings (indigo, sugar, tobacco, coffee, and silver) and &quot;violet&quot; buildings that grant special powers or extra victory points. Cards from the hand can be either built or used as money to build something else; cards from the deck are used to represent goods produced by the production buildings, in which case they are left face-down. A seven-card hand limit is enforced once per round.<br/><br/>In each round (or governorship), each player in turn selects from one of the available roles, triggering an event that usually affects all players, such as producing goods or constructing buildings. The person who picks the role gets a privilege, such as producing more goods or building more cheaply.<br/><br/>Though similar in concept to Puerto Rico, the game has many different mechanisms.

To begin with you click on the enemy with your mouse to deal 1 damage to an enemy per click. The game is broken up into levels. Each fifth level is a boss. On regular levels you have to defeat ten enemies to unlock the next level. Levels can be returned to once you have passed them, and you can stay on a level as long as you like. There is no time limit on normal levels. On boss levels you must defeat the boss in 30 seconds. If you fail the boss will respawn at full health.<br/><br/>Each time you defeat an enemy you gain gold. The gold can be spent to pay for heroes to join you. The first hero you can hire increases the effectiveness of your clicks, so that you can get beyond one damage per click. Gold can also be spent to level up the heroes so they are more effective.<br/><br/>The remaining heroes you can hire do a certain amount of damage per second to the enemy on the screen. They do this damage whether you are clicking or not.<br/><br/>There are also heroes that can unlock special powers that you can use. These powers have a cooldown time before they can be used again.<br/><br/>You also gain gold while the game is stopped. In fact this idle game you gain money whether the game is open in a tab or not, and you gain gold faster if it it closed than open.<br/><br/>"}, "166675": {"poll": [], "name": "FIFA 15", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Nintendo 3DS download edition", "Nintendo 3DS North American physical edition", "Nintendo Wii North American physical edition", "Playstation 3 North American download edition", "Playstation 3 North American physical edition", "Playstation 4 download edition", "Playstation 4 North American physical edition", "Playstation Vita download edition", "Playstation Vita North American physical edition", "Windows download edition", "Xbox 360 download edition", "Xbox 360 North American physical edition", "Xbox One download edition", "Xbox One North American physical edition"], "average": "8.625", "videogameseries": ["FIFA"], "videogametheme": ["Sports - Soccer"], "usersrated": "8", "videogamedeveloper": ["EA Sports"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo 3DS", "PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 4", "PlayStation Vita", "Wii", "Windows", "Xbox 360", "Xbox One"], "videogamehonor": ["2014 Game Critics Best Sports Game of the Year Nominee", "2014 Gamescom Best Multiplayer Game of the Year Nominee", "2014 Gamescom Best Sports Game of the Year Nominee", "2014 Global Game Awards Best Sports Game of the Year Winner", "2014 The Game Awards Best Sports/Racing Game of the Year Nominee", "2015 British Academy Game Awards Best Sports Game of the Year Nominee", "2015 D.I.C.E.

Well, this one mixes a bit of the older Little Spaces approach (sense/element/descriptor) with the Insta-NPCs approach (a collection of directed tables) to offer two different ways to use it. First, you can create piratey descriptions using the traditional route. And second you can turn around and use a different set of tables to help create some encounters to help fill in the gaps.<br/><br/>For instance, let's say the PCs are out on the open water traveling across the ocean to their next destination, when on the horizon they see black sails and the Jolly Roger waving in the wind. Pirates!<br/><br/>A few die rolls give me Touch (Sense), Captain (Element), Shouting (Descriptor), and Neutral (Flavor). That leads to:<br/><br/>&quot;As the ship closes, you hear the Captain shouting not at his own crew but towards your ship. 'We'll be boarding ye soon! Prepare to give us yer gold -n- silver or yer lives. There's no negotiatin'!' You can somehow feel, even at this distance, the sinister promise in his voice.&quot;<br/><br/>Now I can turn around and generate an Encounter to follow. With another handful of dice I get - Coastal Waters (Place), Dealing with the locals (Event), Neutral (Flavor), and Swearing (Descriptor). That may lead to:<br/><br/>&quot;Your pirate captors have your ship in tow and have dragged you back near the coast of a local island. As soon as you see land, you see a handful of small boats row quickly towards you and as they get closer you see them brandishing primitive blades and shouting in their native tongue. It doesn't take long to see they have a bone to pick with the Pirate Captain, who is swearing at them until the air turns blue on deck...&quot;<br/><br/>If it's our PCs who have been captured by pirates and now face an attack by some angry locals, I wonder how they'll play it? Will they use the event as an opportunity to escape?<br/><br/>Thousands of possible combinations will inspire an insane number of adventurous encounters and hidden dangers.

The downside to this is using the cameras, doors or lights drains a power meter and if it reaches 0% the power cuts and you will be unable to defend yourself.

Both games have characters described by a single sentence: I&rsquo;m a blank blank who blanks.

England has built an extensive empire on which the sun never set, vastly extending its domain beyond the British Isles on the spur of the Plantagenets, a royal lineage that dominated much of medieval European history, a dynasty forged from steel and blood, a lineage that would prevail for more than half a millennium. Plantagenet is a name that inspires admiration among enemies and fear among allies.<br/><br/>Henry II, the first Plantagenet king to extend and stabilize his domains, contracted a political marriage with Eleanor of Aquitaine, a marriage intended to generate heirs to the throne. This strategic alliance by marriage produced four heirs: children who would rebel against their own father, more than once, leading to war, bloodshed and pacification, the stuff history is made of.<br/>Who is going to inherit the throne? Who will prove to be worthy of the illustrious name of Plantagenet? After years of battles and rivalry, only two of the heirs survived.<br/><br/>The first, opposed by his own father, is a man with a destiny marked out by his own land, which he rarely set foot on as he was preoccupied for his entire life in conquests beyond the British Isles. The hope of an entire era would depend on his choices. The difference between being the usurper or the chosen one would depend on his actions. He is Richard I of England, better known as Richard the Lionheart.<br/>The other, the last born, was far removed from the throne. Overshadowed by his own family, derided by his own people and saddled with the unfortunate title of &ldquo;Lackland&rdquo;, John Lackland had the opportunity of a lifetime: Richard left for the Crusades and John could claim the throne for himself in Richard&rsquo;s absence. But would he have the mettle of a king? Would he surpass his more illustrious brother Richard? Would he be able to counter his brother&rsquo;s supporters?<br/><br/>A wise choice as to with whom to form an alliance is crucial to one&rsquo;s place in history. Only brave choices will crown the true king of England, and only those who loyally and valiantly supported him in the conquest and administration of the kingdom would be remembered in history. This is a choice that only the strong and the wise would make.This is history.<br/><br/>In Richard I, the players assume the role of the characters who remained in England when King Richard I left for the Crusades. They have to decide which side to take without knowing whether Richard I will return home a victor with glory and riches, or he won't come back at all (but there are many possible intermediate outcomes).<br/><br/>During the game, the players take turns to influence the different characters available in order to earn prestige points (PPs) for themselves, but also to use their powers to influence the Crusade from far away by sending resources. A player might even decide to betray his own side, if worrying news were to come from the East...<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the outcome of the Crusade leads to an increase of PPs for the players who were deployed by the faction which has achieved its goal, but the game has only one winner: the player who has accumulated the most PPs, regardless of the faction to which he belongs!<br/><br/>The object of the game is to amass the most Prestige Points (PP) by wisely choosing alliances and exerting influence on the performance of the Crusade.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "Italian first edition"], "name": "Richard I", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Partnerships", "Variable Player Powers"], "average": "7.05458", "usersrated": "120", "age": "12"}, "166728": {"statistics": [], "name": "Nintendo 3DS Stand", "videogamehardwarecategory": ["Add-On"], "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamehwmfg": ["Nintendo Co., Ltd."], "poll": [], "videogamehwversion": ["AUS Bundled Stand", "JP Bundled Stand", "NA/EU Bundled Stand"], "videogamehardware": ["Nintendo 3DS"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Every physical copy of Kid Icarus: Uprising is bundled with a 3DS stand that is intended to help with the games control scheme by relieving the need to hold the 3DS.<br/><br/>"}, "166729": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2984040.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Roberto Di Meglio", "Marco Maggi", "Francesco Nepitello"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Phroilan Gardner"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ares Games"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2984040_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Novel-based", "Wargame"], "description": "Age of Conan: The Strategy Board Game &ndash; Adventures in Hyboria, an expansion for use with Age of Conan, casts a strong spotlight on Conan himself, giving a new dimension to his role in the game and adding new elements to give more character and more flavor to each Kingdom.

Three major groups are distinguished. First come the attractive and simple games requiring care and patience to bring them out, then games requiring a balance of judgement and card sense and finally those which call for the type of positional analysis more usually associated with chess problems than card games.

They are called this because they resemble trolls, and regenerate like trolls, but are usually the same size as kobolds and troglodytes.<br/><br/>They are actually a type of magical fungus, created by long-dead archmages driven mad by the arcane energies of other planes. This fungus has the ability to absorb and replicate the genetic material of other living things it consumes. This is not a particularly fast process, but over the last thousand years or so it has resulted in the fungus achieving its present form. Pygmy cave trolls reproduce by budding, and must continue to consume living things in order to profit from their abilities.

Upon arriving at the Imperial compound, however, the servants are chagrined to discover Raiders from the North climbing the walls, hastening to harvest the fabled fruit for themselves.<br/><br/>In Imperial Harvest, players build a modular board replete with moats and hedges then take turns drafting a unique trio of fantastic champions who will either raid or protect the imperial strawberry patch. To be successful, each player must master the powers of their respective characters, navigate the Imperial Gardens, evade enemy attacks, and collect the majority of the realm&rsquo;s mysterious, magical fruit.<br/><br/>Imperial Harvest takes place over 7 rounds (less, if all strawberries are plucked before game-end) and takes roughly 20 minutes to play. A cloth play mat is included in the game box for players that prefer not to create their own modular board or who prefer a quicker game setup. Each character in Imperial Harvest features a basic side (for novice/casual players) and an advanced side (for experienced/competitive players). Additionally, all components (garden tiles, character cards, etc.) are 100% compatible with Royal Strawberries (both games are stand-alone but also expand each other).<br/><br/>IMPERIAL HARVEST: TAG TEAM (allows 2 additional players per additional copy of Imperial Harvest):<br/>Grab another copy of Imperial Harvest, expand your board, and bring a new group of players to the table!

While time travel has not yet been successful, or rather, while time travel has not yet been sanctioned by the Elites, translocation is allowed.<br/><br/>Translocation, or the travel to another location by translocation devices, allows a translocater to move quickly from one place to another at the blink of an eye, between sender and receipient nodes. The technology was not new, but it took time for the Elites to consider and approve it. There are always pros and cons to technology, those who used it for good were able to maximise the outcome for themselves and others in a fair and transparent manner to benefit society as a whole; but there were also those who used it for selfish reasons and benefitted themselves only, or worse, consequently harmed others. Once the laws were passed, once all concerns addressed and loopholes closed, translocation was given the green light.<br/><br/>At the first, translocation made things simpler. People travelled faster. Time was saved. Efficiency was increased many-fold. The Elites sold the technology by its uses for the people, including and especially in the areas of medicine and crime prevention. The illustrations that were commonplace demonstrated how lives could be saved, if a newly-removed organ was translocated a great distance to someone who needed it urgently. It also showcased how the Enforcers were able to instantly apprehend a criminal by sending their police to the scene of a crime with all immediacy, sans travel or horrendous traffic conditions.<br/><br/>And then it drew the attention of a separate race of people, the Reis. This was a race created no different from the humans on Earth, except that a minority of this race of people were borne, imbued, with the Gift. The Rei who had the Gift were telepatically connected to each other, as long as any Rei chose to allow such a connection, so they could be known to each other. These allowed enclaves to form, for good or bad. The hackers of a particular enclave found a way to link the Earth's translocation devices to their own, and sent their people to Earth.<br/><br/>The Elites of the humans learned of the Reis by accident, but by then it was impossible to prevent an invasion. It was not a normal invasion, no, there was no invasion of the physical sort. It was simply takeover. The next thing the Elites knew, the next human was indistinguishable from the next Rei. It became impossible to tell the both apart, and so there was nothing to be done, except accept things for what they had become. And so it came to past that Earth was no longer home to one intelligent race only, the humans. It was now shared with the Reis, or the Reis who travelled to Earth.<br/><br/>The humans coined a name for the Reis, the aliens that invaded their Earth, as &quot;Traveller&quot;.<br/><br/>"}, "166769": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3446308.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jason Little"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2017", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Matias Tapia"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Split Second Games"], "maxplaytime": "75", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3446308_t.png", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Medical", "Travel", "Zombies"], "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Nearly 75% of the U.S. population is infected with an airborne disease: the Z-B13 virus.

It is a sequel to the 2013 game Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3. The game was released on September 2014 in Japan, North America, and Europe.<br/><br/>The game features a revamped fighting system. It includes new ways of forming teams based on their skills as well as counterattacks and guard breaks. Masashi Kishimoto worked in the game by providing the new character Mecha Naruto as well as new designs for the characters belonging to the organization Akatsuki whose back-stories are being told in this game. The game also includes a tournament mode where the player can battle against three CPU fighters at the same time. Players are also able to customize characters.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The game introduced guard-break and counterattack. In the former, the player breaks the guard of the opponent, knocking him or her unconscious. This gives the player the opportunity to unleash a deadly attack to inflict serious damage. There is a limit, however, on the number of times it can be used. In regards to the counterattack, if an opponent is about to land an attack on the player, the players can knock them unconscious, rendering them helpless and sealing their support. Timing is the key here and a counterattack is a chakra-consuming action. The game also features a revamped support system. There are largely three types of teams. The Drive type locks the battle with a Sealed Barrier that always activates the Support Drive ability. Support Drives call in other team members to chain attacks with the player's main character or block for him depending on the type of support the three man cell provides. Ultimate Jutsu type is a team that can do a heavy damage super attack, which depends on the team the player use. Awakening team types can use an awakening at the start of the battle by using the right analog stick.<br/><br/>The game has 118 playable characters, with new characters being added in addition to returning ones. Series creator Masashi Kishimoto was involved in the game to design an original character: a robot version of Naruto named Mecha-Naruto who has a two-stage awakening: a three-tails transformation and a Mecha-Kurama transformation. Playing a role in the newly introduced four-player Tournament Mode, Mecha-Naruto appears in a two-part episode of the Naruto Shippuden series that aired on the day of the game's release in Japan. In addition to the new character, Kishimoto also designed new costumes for Sasori, Deidara, Hidan, Kakuzu, and Orochimaru, as well as the design for a technique used by one of the game's new characters, Shisui Uchiha.<br/><br/>In addition to following the series canon until the latest animated episode, the game features new side stories. These include stories about Akatsuki, Shisui Uchiha and Kushina Uzumaki. After working to create new animations for Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations, the developer of Naruto anime series, Studio Pierrot was once again involved to animate 50 minutes worth of animation for the new side stories.<br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>The first of three original animated stories, &quot;Creation of the Akatsuki&quot;, reveals the origins of the new group's membership. After the events that lead to Yahiko's death, Obito appears in his Tobi guise before Pain and Konan after the former killed Hanzo and gain control of the Hidden Rain Village. Obito tells them to rebuild the Akatsuki's ranks with a membership of ten as he instructs Pain and Zetsu to recruit Kakuzu while Konan drafts Sasori. At that time, Obito personally recruits Itachi and then Kisame. Later, Orochimaru manages to attract the Akatsuki's attention to join their ranks for his own purposes. After the recruitment of Deidara by Itachi and Hidan by Kakuzu and Orochimaru, the Akatsuki's ranks are complete as they begin their mission to find and capture the tailed Beasts. The second story is tells of Shisui Uchiha at the time of his death while the third, &quot;The Far Reaches of Hope&quot;, depicts Kushina Uzumaki interacting with a young Obito and the rest of Team Minato.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "166787": {"poll": [], "name": "Sparkle 2", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android Downloadable edition", "iPhone Downloadable edition", "Macintosh Downloadable edition", "PSN Playstation 4 edition", "PSN Playstation Vita edition", "Symbian Downloadable edition", "Windows Downloadable edition", "Windows Phone Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2667768.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Sparkle"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["10tons Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPhone", "Macintosh", "PlayStation 4", "PlayStation Vita", "Symbian OS", "Windows", "Windows Phone"], "average": "3.5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["10tons Ltd."], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2667768_t.jpg", "description": "The long-awaited sequel to the award-winning hit action puzzle!<br/><br/>A long time ago, five keys were created.

You'll generate factions and communities to fill that world, striving for both good and evil. By the end, you'll tell the story of your explorer's discoveries, and her triumph or failure - and you'll be left with a dynamic world full of adventure possibilities. Overlook can thus be used to generate a setting that your group will explore with another game. But it can also be played as a self-contained game for an evening's entertainment. The game should take about 45 minutes per player.<br/><br/>Overlook is a role-playing game in the sense that you will invent characters to inhabit as you play the game, characters you should care about and cheer for. But it is also a story-telling game in the sense that you will often step away from those characters to author details of the world &ndash; many of which will conflict with your character's goals.

Players can also monitor their characters from their mobile devices as the action progresses. To create an interesting character, a good selection of race and profession is paramount. Rolemaster also provides background options to add more variety between characters. In the free base ERA product you will find 2 sample races, 2 professions and 3 background options.<br/><br/>This feature package adds all races, professions and background options in RM Classic Character Law. Choose one of 11 races, including a variety of elves, but also trolls and orcs. This will automatically affect your stats and resistances.

DramaScape is looking for some mercenaries to keep it secure.<br/><br/>The product is a single external map of the surroundings, walls, and courtyard of a small border fortress with an internal map of the inner keep&rsquo;s three rooms.<br/><br/>Border Fort is intended for use in fantasy games. One idea for a more modern game is to fill the border fort with a tank or tank destroyer group for the Germans that have run out of gasoline. The tanks are placed at the gate making them immobile forward facing artillery. With artillery and flak guns behind the tanks in the courtyard, the allies can&rsquo;t leave this defensive strong point behind their lines. The Allies decide to flank the Germans on the eastern side of the fort by ramming a tank through the weak wooden wall to get the troops in&hellip;if the convoy can make it past the artillery. If the player characters can take out the flak guns, they can call in an air strike on the fortress as well.<br/><br/>Adventure Hook for use with this map:<br/><br/>Invasion! The group has run afoul of a massive band of enemies along a supposedly peaceful border. A chase ensues with the band trying to hunt them down, mistaking them for border patrol scouts. The group spots the border fort in the distance during the chase and can decide to go towards the fortress or bravely try to divert them away from the fort.<br/><br/>If they reach the fort, they find the gates open with no doors. The three or four guards at the fortress see the massive horde and realize their plight. The group needs to either help the guards fend off the horde or failing that cut a path through to escape and reach the capital to warn the king (Our Western Keep make can be used as the capital of the kingdom).<br/><br/>"}, "166847": {"rpgdesigner": ["D.

The game follows the titular heroine, a schoolgirl-assassin who is tasked with killing her own father.<br/><br/>The game puts players in the role of the eponymous Ranko Tsukigime, as she races through levels attempting to outrun a wave of spirits chasing after her. Ranko's basic maneuverability allows her to jump, hover across long gaps, slide under obstacles, and jump off walls. Ranko also has a melee attack which can destroy enemies, as well as reflect enemy fire. By destroying enemies, the player can trigger chain reactions which may automatically destroy other nearby enemies. Along with some areas requiring the players to defeat all enemies in an area to progress, defeating enemies helps fuel ammunition for a fire-arm which can be used to push back the pursuing spirits in case they get too close.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Short Peace&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "166884": {"poll": [], "name": "Caverns of Minos", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iOS download edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Space"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Llamasoft"], "videogamegenre": ["Scrolling", "Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["iPhone"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Llamasoft"], "description": "Caverns of Minos is an arcade shooting game for iOS devices developed by Jeff Minter and Ivan Zorzin of Llamasoft and published via the Apple App Store.

It is an extended version of the original game Caverns of Mars released for the Atari 8-bit family, with inspiration from Lunar Lander and Oids. It is the Minotaur Project game representing the Atari 8-bit family.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The gameplay resembles that of Caverns of Mars in that the player is required to descend to the bottom of a cavern, avoiding enemies along the way, and then to escape. Rather than blowing the cavern up, in Caverns of Minos the player's objective is to collect an object from the bottom of the cavern and deliver it to the &quot;Mothersheep&quot; that waits at the top of the cavern.<br/><br/>Unlike the original Caverns of Mars, the ship in Caverns of Minos does not descend at a fixed rate: it is sped up gradually by gravity and the player can choose to fire thrusters to slow it down or move it upwards. As the ship moves down through the cavern, it encounters numerous enemies, some of which can be destroyed by firing at them. The ship fires continuously but the bullets fired can be steered by tilting the mobile device. The ship also encounters minotaurs which can be rescued by landing the ship on the ground near them. Landing without damage requires careful use of the thruster and smoother landings are rewarded with bonus points.<br/><br/>The game supports four play modes, with a different ship provided to the player in each:<br/><br/>Novice: the player's ship moves side-to-side and thrusts as normal, fires upwards and downwards, and has a strong shield.<br/>Pilot: the player's ship is more maneuverable and has a more effective thruster, but has a lower shield.<br/>Warrior: the player's ship fires from side to side as well as upwards and downwards, but has a lower shield.<br/>Commander: the player's ship does not move side-to-side but rather rotates and thrusts directionally.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Caverns of Minos&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "166886": {"poll": [], "name": "UFC Undisputed 3", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Europe physical PS3 edition", "Europe physical Xbox 360 edition", "Japan physical PS3 edition", "Japan physical Xbox 360 edition", "North America physical PS3 edition", "North America physical Xbox 360 edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["UFC Undisputed"], "videogametheme": ["Martial Arts"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Yuke's"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360"], "videogamehonor": ["2011 Game Critics Best Sports Game of the Year Nominee"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Konami", "THQ"], "description": "UFC Undisputed 3 is a mixed martial arts video game featuring Ultimate Fighting Championship properties and fighters developed by Yuke's and published by THQ.

To get myself pumped (and hopefully not have to do that much heavily lifting) I read through the Neo-Anarchist's Guide to North America by FASA and The Rotten Apple: Manhattan by Catalyst Game Labs and was floored by how boring these books are and how they provide nothing useful at the gaming table, which is essential to me.<br/><br/>Largely I've found that most RPG setting books follow the same philosophy as the two books mentioned above and that is boring to me.

From there, the game master can control all aspects of the game: resolve maneuvers, resistances, resting, and of course, spell casting and combat.<br/><br/>With ERA you can create Rolemaster characters and then manage their adventures. Players can also monitor their characters from their mobile devices as the action progresses. But the real magic comes when you start spell slinging. In the free base ERA product you will find 2 sample spell lists, plus the fire bolt attack table along with the heat critical table.<br/><br/>This feature package adds all spells, attack and critical tables in Rolemaster Classic Spell Law. Make your mage learn from the extensive RMC spell list selection. A total of 162 spell lists with the complete description of each spell will be at your disposal. Once learned by a character, ERA will display all available spells during the adventure, so that the player can access all descriptions, and the GM can easily indicate each casting, with the option of obtaining automatic computation of penalties depending on preparation rounds, use of hands, etc.<br/><br/>And when the elements are involved, you can now resolve directed and area elemental attacks with the corresponding 7 tables, proceeding with the automatic lookup in the 4 elemental critical tables.<br/><br/>ERA is compatible with Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.<br/><br/>"}, "166909": {"rpgdesigner": ["John Kovalic"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgseries": ["Series Pitch of the Month"], "name": "Campus Desk", "rpgartist": ["Jonathan Wyke"], "rpgproducer": ["Craig Hargraves", "Cathriona Tobin"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2257724.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["DramaSystem"], "rpgpublisher": ["Pelgrane Press"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)"], "rpggenre": ["Modern"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2257724_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>John Kovalic (Dork Tower, Munchkin) returns to ink-spattered halcyon days with Campus Desk: students behind the Daily Forward, newspaper of Wisconsin State University, figure out life, love, and burying the lede.<br/><br/>"}, "166910": {"rpgartist": ["William McAusland", "Tommi Salama", "Jeff Ward"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Fulhurst Moors", "rpgdesigner": ["Jacob Trier"], "rpgproducer": ["Creighton Broadhurst"], "usersrated": "0", "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2258873.jpg", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgsetting": ["The Lonely Coast"], "average": "0", "rpgissuearticle": ["Fulhurst Moors at a Glance", "Fulhurst Moors at a Glance"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Raging Swan Press"], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Village Backdrop"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2258873_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>In the dreary village of Fulhurst Moors, most residents spend their days cutting peat from the nearby bogs or tending flocks of rugged sheep on the moor.

The player with the lowest starting<br/>number starts and rolls both dice.<br/>What do the dice show?<br/>&bull; Two matching colors<br/> Throw the dice again.<br/>&bull; Two different colors<br/> Take the flicking string and try to flick the race car matching the color on one of the die to<br/>another race car of the other color.<br/>Important: It mustn't come into contact with any another vehicles!<br/>Did you hit the right vehicle, and not touch another one in the process?<br/><br/>&bull; Yes:<br/> Brilliant! Take the gray trophy and put it on top of your own trophy, then advance one space<br/> towards the target.<br/> Whenever you have successfully flicked, you can choose between two options: <br/>1. Take a risk and carry on: Roll both dice again and continue as described above.<br/>2. Score points and end your turn; put your trophy in the place of the gray trophy and<br/> place the gray trophy back next to the points bar.<br/><br/>&bull; No:<br/> That's too bad! No points. If the gray trophy is displaying points that you already won, then<br/>you lose these points and the gray trophy is placed back next to the points bar.<br/>The player with the next starting number then takes their turn. Before rolling the dice, the<br/>player must fi rst check to see whether the distance between the sideline banners and the<br/>racing cars is at least the length of the short side of the drift block. If this is not the case,<br/>then the player may move the race cars accordingly.<br/><br/>End of the game<br/>The game ends when a player managers to reach the last space or beyond on the points bar<br/>with their trophy, and by doing so they win the &quot;Rumble Rage&quot;.<br/>Tips for experienced Rumble Racers:<br/>&bull; Double points: If you roll two of the same color and the gray trophy is already showing one<br/> or more points, then your go will score double points. Drag the gray trophy forward the<br/> exact same number of spaces that separate it from your trophy, then roll again.<br/>&bull; Drifting: If you use the drift block during your fl ick and it works, i.e. the fi rst vehicle bounces<br/> off the drift block before it hits the second vehicle, then you get an extra point and are<br/> allowed to move the gray trophy one space forward.<br/>&bull; Side banner crash: If you touch another vehicle with an outer band, then you do not receive<br/> any points and your turn ends immediately.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual first edition (German packaging)", "Multilingual first edition (U.S. packaging)"], "name": "Crash Cup Karambolage", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": ["Press Your Luck"], "age": "6", "usersrated": "20", "average": "6.2", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 107-- Gen Con 2015 Wrap up and La Granja Review", "Essen 2014 - HABA", "GenCon 2015 - HABA USA", "TPGC - Episode #57 - Strong Stuff, Ring-o Flamingo, Crash Cup and Castle Knights"]}, "166928": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Carlo A.

That winner was 9-Shooter Quick Draw by Ryan Strong.<br/><br/>As you might expect with a game about a gunfight in the dusty streets of an old west town, the rules for 9-Shooter Quick Draw (9SQD) are dead-simple.<br/><br/>Each player gets 3 gunslingers, 3 action cards, and 1 set of Square Shooters&reg; dice.<br/><br/>Both players reveal a gunslinger and face it so their opponent can see the poker hand printed on the card.<br/><br/>Both players pick up their dice and shake them in their fists until one player shouts &quot;DRAW!&quot; They both roll their dice and the gunfight begins.<br/><br/>You're trying to roll the poker hand on your opponent's gunslinger card and you can lock in any of your matching dice at any time, but after that first big roll, you can only re-roll unlocked dice that have...<br/><br/>The same number (Aces, 4's, Kings, etc...)<br/><br/>The same suit (Hearts, Clubs, etc...)<br/><br/>If you have no matching dice, you can only re-roll a single die of your choice.<br/><br/>If your opponent catches you rolling mismatched dice, you have to stop, give him a hard look, and re-roll a single random die to re-set.<br/><br/>BTW, Jokers are wild so they can be any number and suit you like.<br/><br/>That's it. You both keep rolling as fast as you can until one of you locks in all of the dice to match the other's gunslinger card. That player shouts &quot;BANG!&quot; and your gunslinger is dead! Lose all three of your gunslingers and the town's undertaker is gonna be one busy man.<br/><br/>Hey, quiet down, I hear ya. What about those action cards? Well, if you think you're ready for them I'll clue you in, but these cards are for the experts. It ain't easy dividing your attention between rollin' dice and readin' cards.<br/><br/>Each action card says when it can be used and what the effect is when it's played. You flip out the card and call out the name, then your opponent has to stop everything and do what the card says. That might mean waiting for you to get in some extra rollin', or maybe having to unlock one die.

The game was distributed by Techn\u014ds in Japan and North America and by Tecmo in Europe and Australasia. It is the sequel to Techn\u014ds' previous WWF game, WWF Superstars. Compared to Superstars, WrestleFest adds a variety of different wrestlers to the roster as well as enhanced graphics and sound. There are more voice samples, including commentary and pre-match introductions by WWF ring announcer Mike McGuirk. The voiced cut scenes featuring Gene Okerlund from Superstars returned as well.<br/><br/>Just like its predecessor, WrestleFest simulates professional wrestling matches. The game adds support for up to four simultaneous players and the ability to insert more credits into the machine to buy energy.<br/><br/>Players can perform numerous double team moves. These are performed by tagging in a partner with the opponent in the proper position or tagging while holding the opponent in a headlock. Additionally, after a team member has been on the apron for a certain length of time, they will &quot;power up,&quot; temporarily giving them the ability to win all grapples and inflict more damage than usual.<br/><br/>The moveset in WrestleFest differs from WWF Superstars in that more than one maneuver is assigned to each control combination and these vary widely among the characters. For example, Ted DiBiase may respond to the &quot;punch&quot; button during a grapple by performing a backbreaker, a piledriver, a suplex, or his Million Dollar Dream finisher. The move he performs depends partially on a CPU &quot;variety&quot; sequence and on the energy level of the opponent.<br/><br/>Modes<br/><br/>Two mode of play are available. In Saturday Night's Main Event mode, the player must pick two wrestlers to form a tag team and take them through a series of matches, including a title match with the Legion of Doom. After winning the title match, the player must once again take their team through a series of matches and finally defeat the Legion of Doom a second time to complete the game.<br/><br/>In the new Royal Rumble mode, the player picks one superstar and takes him through a Royal Rumble match. Elimination occurs by pinfall, submission, or being thrown out of the ring. Before a new wrestler enters the match, an inset of the wrestler taunting in front of a camera appears on screen.<br/><br/>Featured wrestlers<br/><br/>The game features ten selectable wrestlers. Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior, &quot;Million Dollar Man&quot; Ted DiBiase and Big Boss Man return from WWF Superstars. Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts, Earthquake, Mr. Perfect, Sgt. Slaughter, Demolition Smash, and Demolition Crush, are available as new characters, with The Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal) making an appearance as a non-selectable boss tag team.<br/><br/>By default, Demolition must be selected as a team in Main Event mode and can not be teamed with any other playable characters. Under emulation, cheat codes allow the player to team Smash or Crush with other characters.<br/><br/>Hawk and Animal are not initially selectable in the arcade version, but a second player can &quot;buy-in&quot; to the game while the first player battles Legion of Doom in the Main Event mode, allowing them to control Hawk and Animal and continue playing as them if they win the two-player match. Cheat codes for emulators exist to allow the Legion of Doom to be playable (both together and separately). Both Hawk and Animal have twice as much energy as the other characters.<br/><br/>The Legion of Doom can perform their team finisher, the Doomsday Device; however, if the move is not set up in a precise area of the ring, Hawk will not go to the top rope, and the timer will have to be allowed to run out or the game will need to be reset. The Demolition Decapitation finisher does not appear in the game. Instead, Smash and Crush perform a suplex and a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker, respectively, as finishers.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;WWF WrestleFest&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "166993": {"poll": [], "name": "ModNation Racers: Road Trip", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/Europe PlayStation Vita edition", "North American PlayStation Vita edition", "PlayStation Vita Download edition"], "average": "6.75", "videogametheme": ["Driving"], "usersrated": "4", "videogamedeveloper": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["Racing"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation Vita"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "description": "ModNation Racers: Road Trip is a kart racing game developed by SCE San Diego Studio for the PlayStation Vita.

It is the Minotaur Project game representing the Namco System 86.<br/><br/>In August 2012, a Mac OS X port was released via the Mac App Store.<br/><br/>The player controls a small, constantly firing, ship that can be steered around the whole of the playfield with swipes of the iOS touchscreen. Various enemies appear on the playfield and will attack the player's ship. The game is divided into a number of levels (or grids) with set patterns of enemy attack on each grid. At the end of each level a bonus life is awarded and the next grid begins. To aid the player shooting certain enemies will release spinning coloured disks that increase the player's attacking powers, these power-ups are short-lived but collecting multiple disks will increase the potency and/or duration of the power-up. More enemy types are introduced as the player moves through the levels of the game, enemies also become more dangerous as the game progresses.<br/><br/>The game can be played in Pure or Casual mode. In Pure mode the player has to start at the first level and progress through each level consecutively until all his lives are lost, after level 4 and every 4th level thereafter the game will create a save point. In Casual mode the player can resume the game at any of the save points he has created when playing in Pure mode with his score and lives set to his best performance at that point. Pure and Casual modes have separate high score tables.<br/><br/>Two control modes are available, novice and expert which adjust the sensitivity of the player's ship to the swipes on the touchscreen.<br/><br/>Gridrunner iOS is normally played with the device in portrait orientation, however rotating the device to the left or right will switch the game from Gridrunner iOS to a version of the game as seen on the Vic-20 or Commodore 64, high score tables and achievements are available for both of these additional versions.<br/><br/>Gridrunner iOS also supports the iCade.<br/><br/>Further details of the game's background and gameplay can be found in Jeff's blog on the Llamasoft web site.<br/><br/>"}, "166995": {"poll": [], "name": "Rollers of the Realm", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["PSN PlayStation 4 Downloadable edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3257387.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Physics"], "usersrated": "12", "videogamedeveloper": ["Phantom Compass"], "videogamegenre": ["Pinball", "RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 4", "Windows"], "average": "6.45833", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Atlus Co.
