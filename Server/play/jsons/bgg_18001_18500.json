In the 1990s computer wargames were covered in glitz, simplified and made into a mass market product. Many of the 70s era grognards don't recognize these games as wargames, but they are. And simple, glitzy wargames are the future. Not entirely, of course, there is also developing a via web based market for lower budget, but more accurate and detailed historical wargames. We'll never get back to the 70s, but with wargames established as a permanent part of the commercial gaming landscape, we can expect an unending stream of new and innovative ideas.&quot;<br/><br/>The first edition was published in 1980 by William Morrow.

Israeli Centurions, Pattons and M-60s vie for battlefield supremacy with Arab T-54s and T-62s, and the arena has become a testing ground for new weapon systems and tactical doctrines while retaining an overall similarity to the armoured conflict of World War 2 which forms the subject matter of earlier books in this series.<br/><br/>This book begins with an introduction to the subject, a short chapter on the origins of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and a detailed description, with maps, of the 1967 and 1973 campaigns. There are two detailed chapters on Arab and Israeli armoured fighting vehicles and their characteristics, anti-tank missiles, conventional artillery, infantry weapons, tactical missiles, minefields and helicopters. There are also chapters on Arab and Israeli armoured organisation and tactics, and two specially commissioned sections on the war in the air by Mike Spick, author of Air Battles in Miniature. Finally, there are detailed playing rules, an appendix listing model suppliers, a technical glossary and an index, making this the ideal book for the increasing numbers of wargamers interested in this fascinating arena.<br/><br/>"}, "18475": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Bruce Quarrie"], "poll": [], "name": "Napoleon's Campaigns in Miniature: A wargamer's guide to the Napoleonic Wars 1796-1815", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "yearpublished": "1977", "usersrated": "19", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic82064_t.jpg", "average": "6.52632", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Patrick Stephens Limited"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic82064.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Revised, Expanded Fourth Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Book", "Miniatures", "Napoleonic", "Wargame"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The empire strikes back with a vengeance in the latest edition of this widely acclaimed book which enables any reader to reverse the tables at Waterloo or avert the French disasters in Spain and Russia!

Players take turns to throw a D6, moving their pieces and following the instructions on the board.  These will generally involve taking cards (which are used later in the game) or placing a bet.  Betting involves placing a marker on the Betting card to indicate, for example, that the yellow player thinks the red dog will come 4th.<br/><br/>Play continues like this until a player's piece passes the &quot;Go to the Traps&quot; space, at which point he/she completes their bets by filling up their betting column, and move their dog to a free trap to await the start of the race.  Once in the traps the player must way until all the other traps are filled.<br/><br/>The Race:<br/>The race phase comprises two actions:<br/>- Playing a card (if you have one) and following the instructions on it.<br/>-  Roll three dice and, using the score on each of the dice to move one of the seven playing pieces forward - three of the pieces (two dogs and the hare, or three dogs) move each turn.<br/><br/>A roll of 10 (on the three dice) allows a player to position a lampost in the path of one of the dogs which prevents the dog from moving until the lampost is moved.<br/><br/>The hare is moved in the same way as the dogs but is normally  in the lead.  If one of the dogs overtakes the hare it is deemed to have eaten it, and is &quot;lamposted&quot;.  At this point the hare is dead and takes no further part in the game, but is deemed (on account of the fact that it is in the dog's stomach) to finish immediately after the dog for betting purposes.<br/><br/>Once a dog crosses the finish line it is placed on the betting card in the position corresponding to where it actually finished the race.  The player owning the dog keeps playing however so as to influence where the other dogs finish.<br/><br/>Once all the dogs are finished, the actual result is compared against the predictions with players scoring as follows:<br/>- 15 points - correct prediction of the winner.<br/>- 10 points - correct prediction of any other position.<br/>- 5 points - almost correct (one place out) prediction of any postition.<br/><br/>Scores are totalled and the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>"}, "18033": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Chris Draper", "Steve Geary", "Ian Lamont"], "poll": [], "name": "Pig Out", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Acting", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1992", "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic79027_t.jpg", "average": "5.25", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Bizarre Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic79027.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Humor", "Party Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "PIG OUT is a party game in which players take a pig character (including Burnt out Boaris the drunken lout, Lady Gammon Steak a toffee nosed sow ...) and place them at the start which is at the center of a playing board that spirals outwards to the finish.<br/><br/>Players move from start to finish, based on dice rolls attempting to collect a total of six donuts on the way.<br/><br/>Donuts are earned on pink squares through successfully answering a &quot;Squealer&quot; question.

Most American political and military leaders viewed the Nazi war machine in Europe as the most menacing of all, and fear that US intervention/involvement may come too late grew with each passing month. Most who viewed the escalating conflict in Asia felt that diplomacy and economic sanctions could bring Japanese aggression on that continent to an end, and even if military force was needed, US and western military prowess would make short work of the armed forces from the empire of the Rising Sun. The sudden and devastating attack at Pearl Harbor on December 7th, the devastating air raids in the Philippines the next day, as well as the loss of Great Britain's battleships Repulse and Price of Wales brought the war home in a shocking and horrifying manner.<br/><br/>Despite the pre-war warnings and plans only in the Pacific, the Phillipines, and China there were Americans ready and able to fight the Axis forces. Of those, only a small group of American mercenary airmen and ground crew who were desperately outnumbered, led by man who had been vilified and disdained while in the US Army Air Force, met with success in the opening weeks of the war.<br/><br/>Chennault's First Fight appears in Against the Odds Magazine #12, by designer Paul Rohrbaugh. Chennault's First Fight covers the Pacific War's opening, when a small group of American mercenary airmen and ground crew, desperately outnumbered and led by a man (Claire Chennault) who had been vilified and disdained while in the US Army Air Force, found their operations repeatedly crowned with success.<br/><br/>Chennault's First Fight covers the first weeks of war in Burma, from mid-December 1941 to the Fall of Rangoon in early March 1942. The focus of the game is on the aerial battles, but the ground campaign is also covered, albeit on a simpler level.<br/><br/>Air units represent groups of 6 to 8 aircraft, while ground units are mostly brigades and regiments. The area map stretches from the Indian Frontier to French Indochina and from the Himalayas to south of Rangoon. An interactive turn sequence keeps both players hopping. There are two levels of air combat resolution, basic and advanced. The basic level has up to 3 rounds of air combat that are resolved on a &quot;battle board&quot; that also uses area movement. The advanced combat resolution system uses a hex map with more turns, very similar to the classic AH game Richtofen's War.<br/><br/>Air units are differentiated by type. Besides the P-40s flown by the Flying Tigers the Allies take wing with Brewster Buffalos, Hawker Hurricanes, P-36s, SB-2s, and Bristol Blenheims. The Japanese fly Oscar and Nate fighters. The heavy lifting is done by Sally, Ann, and Lily bombers while Dinah recon planes (among the fastest and highest flying prop planes built) lead the way. The Japanese must stike hard and fast and avoid getting sucked into what for them was a side-show.

Befitting its epic subject, Napoleon's Triumph is played on a double-sized 44&quot; x34&quot; map of the battlefield.<br/><br/>In spite of the game's size, it is easy to learn and fast to play. The rules are only nine pages long, and the playing time is only two hours. Napoleon's Triumph is unique among big wargames in that players can learn the game, set it up, and play it to completion in a single evening.<br/><br/>The game system is derived from its award-winning forebear, Bonaparte at Marengo. Like that game, Napoleon's Triumph breaks with almost all of the standard wargame conventions. It has no hex grid and terrain effects chart; terrain effects are designed into the map itself. It has no combat results table; combat is resolved through strength differential. It has no dice; tension comes from limited information and the outcome only depends on the players' decisions.<br/><br/>Napoleon's Triumph is a unique wargame experience. It is large, yet fast-playing. It has simple rules, but deep game play that rewards both boldness of conception and attention to detail. It stays close enough to history to engross wargamers and other students of the period, while still being entertaining enough for even non-wargamers to enjoy.<br/><br/>Napoleon's Triumph is not only easy to learn and fast and exciting to play, it also is a great looking game due to its exceptional component quality.  The map is mounted on a heavy board cut in the German style so that the playing surface is durable, stable, and flat, without the valleys of American-style mounted boards or the buckling of paper boards.<br/><br/>To represent opposing armies, the game comes with 140 wooden blocks, blue for the French and red for the Allies. Painted on each block are symbols that identify the type and strengths of the unit. The senior commanders of the opposing armies are represented by 18 metal flags; stickers are applied to mark the nationality and name of each commander.<br/><br/>In play, Napoleon's Triumph combines the visual appeal of 19th century battle maps and military minatures, with columns and rows of units lined for movement and attack, accented by flags to indicate corps. The effect is simply stunning.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Histogame edition", "Simmons edition"], "average": "7.9814", "name": "Napoleon's Triumph", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Simulation"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "1517", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Block wargames"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["I've Been Diced! episode 66: Combat systems"]}, "18099": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Udo Grebe"], "poll": [], "name": "Pearl Harbor", "playingtime": "2400", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement"], "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "6", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic115926_t.jpg", "average": "7.08333", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Udo Grebe Gamedesign"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic115926.jpg", "maxplaytime": "2400", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "2400", "description": "Pearl Harbor features the &quot;China Incident&quot;, a limited war of Japan against China, which eventually develops into a full scale war.

The board can be made quite large, but is usually something like 4x4 segments; the game takes longer as the board gets larger. Each player has pieces of a single color. Pieces can be stacked, but when the stack gets as high as, or higher than, the number of neighbouring hexes, it explodes, spreading one piece to each surrounding hex and destroying the original field. If all seven hexes of a segment have been destroyed, the segment is removed. Thus, during the course of a game the board (Atlantis) disappears into the waves.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to conquer as many free hexes as possible. An area is conquered if it is only touched by hexes without enemy-pieces (compare Go). But beware: Exploding hexes have the nasty tendency to turn into an unstoppable front of explosion and destruction.<br/><br/>As far as I know this game has not been released commercially, but nevertheless it has a large playing community, since the University Game Club (Fanaat) has now more than one generation of offspring players.

It is one of the few card games played with all cards in a standard 52 card deck that can be dealt out evenly to 2, 3 or 4 players.<br/><br/>Play starts with four cards to each player and four cards to the table.  Each numeral card is counted as its numerical value.  The aim is to capture cards laying on the table by playing a card from hand which matches in number a table card or the sum of several table cards (for example, a 2 and an 8 can be captured by a ten).  Cards can also be stacked, called a &quot;build&quot;, to be taken next turn only if you have that card in your hand to take it later, risking their capture by another opponent (for example, a 2 and an 8 can have a 10 stacked upon it, next turn you can take the pile with another 10 and so can an opponent, capturing four cards).  Face cards are captured by the same face card.<br/><br/>Cards must be played onto the table, called &quot;trailing&quot;, if there is nothing to capture.  Picked up cards are accumulated in a pile to be counted at the end of the round.  Once all players four card hands are depleted four cards are again dealt to each player (only deal the table on the first hand of a deck).  This happens until the deck is spent.  Cards remaining on the table after the deck is spent are won by the last player to capture a card.   Scoring depends on the variant.<br/><br/>Most commonly the points total 11.  Per the rules published at pagat.com the scoring is as follows.<br/><br/>Most cards = 3 points<br/>Most spades = 1 point<br/>10 of Diamonds (&quot;Big Casino&quot;) = 2 points<br/>Deuce of Spades (&quot;Little Casino&quot;) = 1 points (also counted as a spade in Most Spades count)<br/>Each Ace = 1 point (4 points with the Ace of spades counting towards most spades).<br/><br/>A total of 11 points per deck, shuffling the deck again and starting over playing to 21.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Anathema<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Public edition", "Quick Draw McGraw Edition"], "average": "6.24139", "name": "Casino", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Set Collection"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "218", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Card Games: Card Fishing", "Card Games: Outplay Games", "Cartoons: Hanna-Barbera", "Traditional Card Games"]}, "18122": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Herb Barents"], "poll": [], "name": "The Battle of Roark's Drift", "playingtime": "240", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "yearpublished": "1978", "usersrated": "20", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic79658_t.jpg", "average": "6.42", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Historical Alternatives"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic79658.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Historical Alternatives First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "240", "description": "This game on the defensive stand of British soldiers immortalized by the movie &quot;Zulu&quot; has become notorious for misspelling the name of the battle as its title.<br/><br/>Each counter represents one British soldier or five Zulus.

These cards illustrate breeding pairs of 12 of the world's most endangered and rare species of wildlife.  The females have cards with pink backs and the males have blue backs.<br/><br/>The 12 female cards are placed face down on 12 yellow squares in the middle of the board.  The 12 male cards are placed face up on the 12 green squares that surround the female cards.  The playing pieces are placed on the circular brown track, next to one of the corners of the board.<br/><br/>Players take it in  turns to roll the dice and move their playing piece in a clockwise direction around the board.  Once moved the playing piece will be next to one of the male animal cards.  The player attempts to make a pair by turning over one of the female cards and showing it to the other players:<br/>-  If it is a match then the piece is removed and placed face down in one of the three bamboo cages at the entrance to that player's conservation park.  The male is left in place on the board.  Each cage can only hold one female so therefore a player can only collect a maximum of three females without them forming part of a breeding pair.<br/>-  If it is not a match then the card is returned to its original face down position.<br/><br/>When a conservationist lands next to the male of any species they may make their play as for the opening rounds if they have no females in their bamboo cages.  If, however they have a female or females caged at the entrance to their conservation park, and they think that one of them is the mate of the male that they have just landed next to, they may attempt to turn that female face up:<br/>-  If they are correct they remove the male from the playing board and place it with the female face down in the conservation park (not back in the cage).  This breeding pair takes no further part in the game<br/>-  If they choose the wrong female then it is simply turned face down again on the conservation park board.<br/><br/>Unscrupulous conservationists may also &quot;steal&quot; breeding females from other player's conservation parks.  When a player lands alongside a male and they think that one of the other players has its mate in one of their cages then they can attempt to steal it by turning it over:<br/>-  If they are correct then the piece is &quot;stolen&quot; and moved to one of their own cages.<br/>-  If they are wrong, it is returned face down where it came from, and if the erring player has any females in his own cages then one of them is released back to one of the free yellow squares in the middle of the board.<br/><br/>No more than one conservationist can occupy the same space on the outside track, and spaces that are not next to males (i.e. the male has already been claimed) are not counted for movement purposes.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, when all the females have been paired, the player with the greatest number of breeding pairs in their conservation park is the winner.<br/><br/>"}, "18144": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Philip N.

It contains pads, pencils, card stands, 47 numbered cards, 10 spyglass cards, and 24 Spy Route Cards.<br/><br/>Each player takes a Spy Route Card and places it in a card stand so that he can see it, but no-one else can.  On each card is the route of a spy, starting from one of six embassies, passing through the Secret Service building, and progressing to a point where the Spy is caught.  Each route is 12 points long, passing through 12 of the 47 numbered points on the card.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to determine the route of the spy on the card to your left.  Every turn you may ask the player on your left about one location on the Route Card.  This is done by the use of the number cards by:<br/>-  Taking the top card from the number deck and playing one card from what is then a hand of 5 (4 cards remain in the hand).<br/>-  Calling out the top card from the discard pile.<br/>-  Using a Spyglass card to ask about any location on the route.<br/><br/>When a number is called the player to the left checks the route and provides one of the following responses:<br/>-  If the number is on the spy's route then the sighting is &quot;Confirmed&quot;.<br/>-  If the number is adjacent to and in visual contact with the spy's route then the sighting is &quot;Witnessed&quot;.<br/>-  If it is neither of the above then there is &quot;No Sighting&quot;.<br/><br/>Information gained is marked accordingly on a Detector Pad.<br/><br/>At any time during a player's turn a player may try to guess the spy's route.  To do this he must call out the 12 numbers of a continuous route, in sequence, starting from the embassy to the spy's point of capture.  The first player to do this correctly is the winner.<br/><br/>"}, "18149": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Phillip Clarke", "Jonathan Moore"], "poll": [], "name": "Clash of Empires: Fire on the Iser", "playingtime": "240", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1985", "boardgameexpansion": ["Clash of Empires"], "usersrated": "3", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic989529_t.png", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Total Fighting Power Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic989529.png", "boardgameversion": ["Total Fighting First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Miniatures", "Wargame"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "240", "description": "Expansion to Clash of Empires from 1984.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Clash of Empires<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "18151": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic94831.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1974", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Cadaco"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic94831_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Murder/Mystery", "Novel-based", "Puzzle"], "description": "Agents of the notorious Professor James Moriarty have stole the crown jewels!

Probes have been sent to Mars, and soon astronauts will be manning rockets in order to mine the planet for newly discovered resources. The first is a brand new element, Celerium, that could prove to be a combustible energy source the likes man has never seen. The second is Sylvanite, an incredibly dense material unlike anything found on earth. In addition to these resources, glaciers have been discovered on the planet. Whoever controls these icy masses could work to create a livable atmosphere on Mars<br/><br/>In Mission: Red Planet, players work as mining companies compete to send astronauts to Mars in order to colonize and mine for recently discovered materials. Over the course of 10 rounds, players play one of their special agents every round to help fill the rockets heading to Mars with their own astronauts while simultaneously working to prevent their opponents from doing the same. Once landed, these astronauts must gather to control specific regions of the planet, each yielding one of the three resources: Celerium, Sylvanite, or Ice. After rounds 5 and 8, players gain score tokens for every region where they control the majority of the astronauts. At the end of the game, players score one final time, adding any bonuses received from Discovery Cards and Bonus Cards. The player with the most score tokens at the end controls Mars, and all the riches it can bring!<br/><br/>From Bruno Faidutti's website:<br/><br/>This one, designed with Bruno Cathala, started with the theme. We wanted to make a game about colonizing Mars, with shuttles leaving the blue planet towards the red one. The theme is strong, and well caught in the steampunk graphic style decided by Asmod\u00e9e.

The 4 packs of cards are made up as follows:-<br/><br/>Red Commodity Cards &ndash; cheapest range from 500 to 1,000 &lsquo;Credits&rsquo;.<br/><br/>Green Commodity Cards &ndash; middle range from 2,000 to 10,000 &lsquo;Credits&rsquo;.<br/><br/>Yellow Commodity Cards &ndash; dearest range from 10,000 to 100,000 &lsquo;Credits&rsquo;.<br/><br/>Blue Cards &ndash; &lsquo;Command&rsquo; cards &ndash; instructions must be followed.<br/><br/>This game can be played by 2 to 6 players aged 8 and over. There are 3 different levels of the game, each being a little more complex than the last. The first level enables you to get used to the basic idea. The second level introduces more advanced rules and techniques.  The third level encourages you to play the game in its purest form, pitting your wits against the other players until a final winner emerges. (You will find a &lsquo;Quick Start Guide&rsquo; on the back of the &lsquo;At Risk Zone Card&rsquo;.)<br/><br/>The idea of the game is to be the most successful Wheeler Dealer&trade; and depending on which level is played, be the first to have a total wealth of up to 3,000,000 &lsquo;credits&rsquo;. Players start with 8,250 &lsquo;credits&rsquo; and a random hand of 4 red and 4 green &lsquo;Commodity&rsquo; cards on level 1.  Players accumulate wealth by selectively buying and selling &lsquo;Commodity&rsquo; cards one at a time, until a &lsquo;set&rsquo; of 3 or more identical cards has been built.  Once a &lsquo;set&rsquo; has been built it may be sold to the &lsquo;bank&rsquo; for 2, 3 or 4 (sometimes more) times the &lsquo;face value&rsquo;.  It is good practice to place the &lsquo;set&rsquo; to be sold to the &lsquo;bank&rsquo; in the middle of the playing board.  &lsquo;Commodity&rsquo; cards sold to the &lsquo;bank&rsquo; are placed at the bottom of the coloured coded deck.<br/><br/>Players must start on the &lsquo;outer circle&rsquo;, from any of the blue spaces, in a clockwise direction. Players may only progress to the &lsquo;inner circle&rsquo; when they have sufficient total wealth (150,000 &lsquo;Credits&rsquo; level 1).  As soon as one player reaches the &lsquo;inner circle&rsquo; all other players are permitted to enter also, even if they do not have sufficient wealth.  Wealth is accumulated faster on the &lsquo;inner circle&rsquo;, however, there are greater risks.  All players must announce that they are going to enter the &lsquo;inner circle&rsquo; before the dice are thrown. Before throwing the dice to move around either &lsquo;circle&rsquo;, players may buy one &lsquo;Commodity&rsquo; card from any other player for 3 times the &lsquo;face value&rsquo;. Other players do not have to sell and only one card may be bought at a time.  If buying a card makes a &lsquo;set&rsquo; of 3 or more the player may also sell the &lsquo;set&rsquo; to the &lsquo;bank&rsquo; before throwing the dice to move around the &lsquo;circle&rsquo;.<br/><br/>Players may at any time during their turn secure loans on other &lsquo;Commodity&rsquo; cards in their possession at &frac12; &lsquo;face value&rsquo; which is known as the &lsquo;At Risk Value&rsquo;. Such cards must be placed on the &lsquo;At Risk Zone Card&rsquo;, unless they form part of the &lsquo;set&rsquo; to be sold immediately to the &lsquo;bank&rsquo;.  &lsquo;At Risk&rsquo; cards may be bought by other players, when it is their turn, at 2 times &lsquo;face value&rsquo;.  If asked, the owner of an &lsquo;At Risk&rsquo; card must sell it to the other player, repay the bank the &lsquo;At Risk Value&rsquo;, plus 10% interest. It is good practice to place the &lsquo;At Risk Zone Card&rsquo; to your left, thereby keeping your cards and money away from the other players.<br/><br/>Once the above options have been exhausted, the player then rolls the dice (2 &lsquo;outer circle&rsquo; 1 &lsquo;inner circle&rsquo;) and moves his playing piece the number of spaces rolled in a clockwise direction.

The setting is mid 18th-century New England, New France and the Old Northwest.  Where a choice had to be made between playability and realism, the choice was made toward ease of play so that the result is closer to a caricature rather than a historical simulation.&quot;<br/><br/>The game name is spelled both Napenaltowaktsche and Napenaltowaksche by the designer throughout the booklet.  It's Lenni Lenape (Delaware Indian) for &quot;They will be scalping each other,&quot; and I don't think the Lenni Lenape much care how you spell it so long as you pronounce it correctly.<br/><br/>It's a skirmish level miniatures wargame, where one figure represents one person.  The game was sold either simply as the rules alone (with basic character cards and player aids to photocopy), or as a full kit with felt and wood terrain, eight painted miniatures (4 Indians, 4 colonists), chits, character cards, player aid cards, movement stick, etc.<br/><br/>The mechanics contain a fair bit of randomness.  A chit for each figure in the game is put into a cup along with three &quot;end of turn&quot; chits - draw a chit to see who moves next.  The player owning the active figure rolls a d6 and adds its current Competence (which starts at 6 and drops as you take wounds) to get a number of action points available for a turn.  Moving one cm takes 1 AP, while loading your flintlock takes 12 AP, tracked on your character card in groups of 4 AP.<br/><br/>If a figure is fired at and the shot comes reasonably close, they must make a reaction check to see what they do.  This can range from running away to holding your ground to firing wildly to charging into melee - the more wounded you become, the more likely you are to run away.<br/><br/>Rules are given for aiming and firing, melee, line of sight through the dense woodland, other terrain, etc.  This is overall a lighter set of rules rather than a true simulation.<br/><br/>"}, "18327": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Pierre Canuel"], "poll": [], "name": "Game of the 5 Fields", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Modular Board", "Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "2005", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic80887_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic80887.jpg", "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Civilization"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "From the designer's website:<br/><br/>&quot;The Game of the 5 Fields could be considered a version of Chess at a strategic scale.

Until now, however, books on the subject have focused either on the recreational side of wargaming or on its military application. Here, Peter Perla presents the first genuine synthesis of both aspects, drawing on his own longtime experiences as a gaming hobbyist and a professional wargamer, in the U.S. defense community. Such a dual, inside perspective is unique among authors and enables him to offer a thorough evaluation of the two arenas, their similarities and differences and their influence on each other.<br/><br/>This book provides the most comprehensive and coherent discussion and analysis of wargaming ever written. Avoiding the sensationalism and superficiality of other works on the subject, it carefully explains the nature of the tool - the wargame - and the process of using it - wargaming. It argues for a better balance between professional realism and hobby playability and for increased cross-fertilization to educate and enlighten users.<br/><br/>Perla looks first at the history of wargaming in both its hobby and professional incarnations, and especially at its use by the Naval War College. He then draws on historical experience to define the fundamental principles of what wargaming is, and what it is not, and describes the subjects that wargaming is most useful for exploring. He also suggests how best to take advantage of its capabilities and downplay its limitiations. Finally, he examines current trends in wargaming in light of those historical perspectives and theoritical principles and projects into the future.<br/><br/>"}, "18354": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "The Way to Play", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "yearpublished": "1975", "usersrated": "8", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic81669_t.jpg", "average": "7.625", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Bantam Books", "Fabbri Editore", "Paddington Press Ltd.", "Het Spectrum"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic81669.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Bantam Softcover Edition", "Fabbri Editore edition 1984"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Book"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From the dust jacket:<br/><br/>&quot;All over the world people play games: from primitive tribesmen to restless executives, and from birthday toddlers to aging millionaires. Wherever people gather, competition - and love of competition - appear.<br/><br/>Even the lone mind seeks the stimulus of games, and in a sense the opponent is still the same. It is always fickle Fate - or our own limitations! - that we are trying to defeat. Games rise and fall in popularity, appear and disappear. Inventiveness, and love of novelty, are always modifying the old and devising new. Games have lives, histories, and family trees. Few of us today have heard of the medieval mine men's morris; but millions of hours are spent on bridge, and chess, and Monopoly - and millions of dollars at poker or roulette. This book covers games that the reader will have seen or heard about - family games and social games, games played for fun, and games played for profit. But it includes, too, many that will be strange: games from foreign countries and ancient times. All are presented through a unique blend of text and illustration. Here the reader can learn not only the secrets of bridge or chemin de fer, but also how to play pachisi or nyout, lasca, or hex, or go. In addition to clearcut, concise rules, the players and equipment each game needs are listed, while the guide on pages 316-317 groups games together according to the number of participants they require. With a little thought, then, it is easy to arrange and even improvise to try an unfamiliar game - whether to make a party go, or to keep a houseful of children quiet! This book will tempt the reader to relax and experiment. It will let him soon settle those old rules disputes. It will be a friendly guide to those games that &quot;everyone else seems to know&quot;.

It simulates, in a general way, the intricate relationships of the lords and vassals of a large, loosely organized Empire located somewhere in Central Europe during the High Middle Ages (ca. 1200-1400). The players try to gain wealth, power and rank while building smaller, more cohesive kingdoms within the Empire for themselves. The game contains a complete and fairly simple set of basic rules and a considerable number of optional rules. These permit infinite variations. A game usually takes from one and a half to two hours.&quot;<br/><br/>Sequence of Play<br/>  Soldiery Payment - players pay the rental for the mercenary companies they control; those he is unable to pay he must auction off; any unowned mercenary companies are auctioned<br/>  Movement and Combat - You must have the permission of a realm's owner in order to move troops through it. Movement into a realm whose owner has refused you permission constitutes an attack on that realm.<br/>  Taxation - players receive taxes from realms they hold; an optional rule allows for tax gouging and revolts<br/>  Election - If either or both the offices of Emperor and Patriarch are vacant, an election is held for each vacant office. Any player who receives at least a third of the votes in an election gains the office; thus there might be as many as three Emperors or Patriarchs; if no player gets at least a third of the votes, the office remains empty.<br/><br/>The map shows only the Empire's political divisions - there is no terrain. It looks like an island, as nothing beyond the Imperial boundaries is shown. The Empire is made up of 68 realms, 60 of which are actually shown on the map (with such colorful names as The Aylemark, The League of Urf Durfal[Gerg Costikyan is listed among the play testers], the Kingdom of Hydanderabad, the Barony of Pfennig-Halfpfennig, the County of Pollenzo-Montenevoso...).  There are six extinct realms; if the player holding the title to an extinct realm gains control of all the realms that make it up, he may revive it, gaining its income, electoral votes and militia.  The two remaining realms are the Empire itself (held by the Emperor) and the Patrimony of Polykarp (held by the Patriarch, head of the Imperial Church). The Emperor can issue the Imperial Ban, and the Patriarch can excommunicate players. The game effect of both of these actions is to force the affected player to make a roll to see whether he can collect some, none or all of his revenues during each taxation period until the ban or excommunication is lifted.<br/><br/>Players perform game actions in order of the precedence of their highest title. The current Emperor goes first, followed by the Patriarch, then Kings and on down through the ranks to the Lord Mayors of free cities. When players' highest ranks are identical, then their second highest ranks are compared, and, if necessary, lesser ranks. Electors have precedence over non-electors, so an Elector-Duke would have precedence over a non-elector Duke.<br/><br/>The basic game has two types of troops: Militia Levies and Mercenary Companies.  Milita are not represented by counters on the map, and only fight in their home realms.  There are 20 mercenary companies, with names like O'Malleys Lancers, The Baratarian Archers, Gustodud's Free Companions, The Titanian Guards and Redmohr's Pikes. All but seven are &quot;venture companies;&quot; they have a home realm, and the current lord of that realm (who isn't necessarily the same person who employs them) may veto their use in combat. The rest are free companies, which may always be used in combat without restriction. There is also an optional rule for Regular Soldiery, which are recruited from realms under a player's control. Like mercenaries, these are represented by counters on the map and may move.<br/><br/>Combat is unusual in that troops are never eliminated. If a player's army is defeated, he must pay ransom for his troops; if unable to play, the opposing player captures and gains control of them. The loser may also be forced to retreat; if unable to retreat, he must pay double the ransom. If the player's noble is present, ransom is also doubled. If a noble is captured (due to being unable to pay ransom), the capturing player &quot;may do as he wishes to the prisoner, including allowing him to be ransomed, selling him to another player, or murdering him.&quot; A noble who dies is succeeded by his heir, who inherits all lands not held as fiefs from other players, all his troops and half his treasury.<br/><br/>Negotiation is encouraged. &quot;The players may negotiate anything and everything within the framework of the rules.&quot; Players may sell, lend or lease their troops, and may sell realms or grant them to other players as fiefs.<br/><br/>Victory is determined in three categories - Most Powerful(most troops), Most Noble(most titles), and Richest - so there can be as many as three winners<br/><br/>Some of the optional rules: single combat, mutinous mercenaries, assassination and conspiracy, plague, special events and even magic.<br/><br/>It is also recommended as being suitable for the background of a miniatures campaign in the medieval or Renaissance period.<br/><br/>"}, "18357": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Olivier Delvaille", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Desbordes"], "poll": [], "name": "Expos: Arts, Business, & Collections", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Memory", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "1998", "usersrated": "7", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic83197_t.jpg", "average": "7.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Expos ABC"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic83197.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["French edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Educational", "Memory"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "An Art Game that you don't need to know anything about Art to play and enjoy.

The games in the series are essentially the same, but as in the different versions of Monopoly, the board and the businesses are specifically themed to the town or city represented in the title - in this case Guildford some 30 miles South West of London.<br/><br/>Players progress around the board as a result of the roll of 2D6.  When landing on a Company square a player may purchase a share in that company (there are two shares available in each company), if he wishes.  If not he may put the share up for auction, with any excess over the sale price being retained by that player as his fee for being the auctioneer.<br/><br/>Players landing on companies that are already owned must pay to visit, with the payment due being based on how many shares are owned in that particular company and in the other two companies in the same colour series.  Since shares can be owned by two different players both may demand payment from a visitor.<br/><br/>Certain squares on the board require the drawing of a Chance card which normally result in income being received from or paid to the bank.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;New Share Quotations&rdquo; square results in the changing of share prices for some of the blocks of companies.  This will result in players losing or gaining money on the shares that they own.  It also requires players to put up one of their shares for auction thereby permitting players to trade in shares.<br/><br/>The game can be ended in three ways, which should be decided before the game starts:<br/>-    After a set time.<br/>-    When the first player becomes bankrupt.<br/>-    When all but one player has gone bankrupt.<br/><br/>At the end of the game the money is counted and shares are valued at whatever is the then current rate.

Each figure represents one person.<br/><br/>Each player controls one &quot;unit&quot; of 20 figures and is given one 52-card deck of ordinary playing cards, which are used instead of dice in this game.  Each unit has one chit (or 3x5 card) used to determine activation randomly in a given turn.<br/><br/>Units are distinguished by a bar of color on the base: since ten players can be playing at once, and there are no uniforms in that era, this is important.  A number of stripes (from 0 to 3) on the color bar shows the morale level of the figure, from militia to average to proven veteran to elite veteran (leader).  This is important both in melee combat and morale checks.<br/><br/>Pigs are a frequent goal of a given scenario, hence the name of the game.  In fact, different units are given different objectives in a raid scenario, though things don't always work out the way one intends ... it can get a bit chaotic.<br/><br/>Cards are used to determine all random events: missile fire, combat, rallying, morale checks, etc.  The system is very easy to understand and there is very little in terms of a player aid needed.  The only downside to the card method is that a player goes through his entire deck before reshuffling, and if he notices all the good cards have been used early, it may change his tactics half way through the game as he becomes more conservative ...<br/><br/>Overall, a good light system, more for &quot;fun&quot; gaming than serious gaming.<br/><br/>"}, "18374": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Rulettes for 16th Century Naval Warfare", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Simulation"], "yearpublished": "1978", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic81362_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Wargames Research Group"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic81362.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Wargames Research Group Edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Miniatures", "Nautical", "Renaissance", "Wargame"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "A &quot;Rulette&quot; is a small rules booklet, according to the publisher.
