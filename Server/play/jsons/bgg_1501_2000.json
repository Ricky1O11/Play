When paintings are drawn from the stack, a value card is clipped to them in this fashion.  Players move around the board by die roll and land on spaces that allow the player to collect money from the bank, receive a painting from the stack, sell a painting to the bank for its value, sell a painting to the bank for a specified amount, auction one of their paintings to the highest bidding opponent, or auction the top painting in the stack to the highest bidder.<br/><br/>The game ends when the painting stack is exhausted.

It was released a few years later as Hexagony by Avalon Hill, and then again as Bin'Fa by the designer under the company name Kenterprises. The Avalon Hill version has slightly different rules. Alan Moon is credited with development of this version. Bin'Fa will be re-released February 2015 after undergoing numerous alterations and rule changes from its previous incarnations.<br/><br/>Bin'Fa/2015 Edition is described by the Publisher/Designer:<br/><br/>Bin&rsquo;Fa is a game of strategy for 2 to 6 players, each of whom controls an army of twelve units, a general and a supply pawn. In multiple army games, each player controls either two or three armies. The object of the game is to capture the opposing army units by surrounding them, thereby removing them from play.<br/><br/>The game board is divided into six separate triangles, which offer almost limitless possibilities for new terrain each game. Each player places his armies at the start of the game in his home battle sector. The board also contains terrain markers and vortex markers, which the armies can use to jump around and appear unexpectedly behind enemy lines, presenting a sudden and unforeseen threat to the rear.<br/><br/>The terrain transforms what would otherwise be a featureless playing area into one that more closely resembles the terrain over which actual battles are fought. With an almost incalculably large number of possible different terrain configurations, strategy cannot be decided in advance. The beginner always stands a chance against the experienced player.<br/><br/>Bin&acute;Fa armies use up supplies when they move just as real armies do. On taking possession of the dice, players must choose between moving their army units on the battle sector (which uses up supplies) or using their turn to move the supply marker in hope of obtaining fresh supplies.<br/><br/>One of the most exciting aspects of Bin&acute;Fa is the &quot;cavalry charge.&quot; As long as a player has sufficient supplies and is lucky enough to avoid rolling a double, it is possible to send a force dashing across the board to attack enemy units and (hopefully) return.<br/><br/>The game of Bin&acute;Fa brings together two strands whose origins go back to very ancient times. Sun Tzu was a famous Chinese general and student of warfare. Bin&acute;Fa is based on the precepts contained in his classic work on the subject, &quot;The Art of War,&quot; written 2,300 years ago. They provide the structural framework for the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Avalon Hill bookshelf edition"], "average": "5.82075", "name": "Hexagony", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "133", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games", "Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Tube Games"]}, "1513": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic487045.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Richard Berthold", "Don Greenwood", "Robert Haines"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1990", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Dave Dobyski", "Charles Kibler", "Kurt Miller", "George I.

It simulates the politics of the Roman Senate during the republic.  The players take the part of various factions vying for the control of the senate.  They control the various powerful families of the time, who compete for state offices, military command, economic concessions and new adherents.  To win the player must get their faction to become the most powerful in Rome.  While doing this, however, a balance must be maintained.  A hostile world situation, and the vagaries of the public of Rome means that the players must also cooperate so that Rome herself doesn't go down under this pressure.  If Rome does not last, neither does the senate, and all players lose!<br/><br/>Players make proposals to the Senate which other players then vote on. A player's ability to make proposals is determined by which Offices his/her Senators hold. A player's influence in votes is determined by the number of Senators they have recruited and the level of influence those Senators have obtained. Proposals may include assigning Senators to governor provinces (generating revenue), recruiting an army to fight an external foe, addressing the concerns of the Roman people, assigning offices or prosecuting previous office holders. Players have to co-operate to overcome the various threats that the game sends against Rome (wars, famine, unrest, bankruptcy) whilst working to build their own Senators' and Generals' positions and undermine that of their opponents.

Scoring is different from Scrabble; there are no prescribed letter values per tile; instead, when a new word is formed, the number of tiles used in that word is counted and used as the score as follows: A word that is flat (no stacked tiles) scores 2 points per tile, but the words that score the most are those that have many stacked tiles, with tiles underneath the spelled word also being counted. The impact of these rules provide for scoring-per-turn increasing as the game continues.<br/><br/>Winning Moves classic 8x8 version: <br/><a target='_blank' href='http://www.amazon.com/Winning-Moves-1194-Classic-Upwords/dp/B00V82MFSY?ie=UTF8&amp=&tag=article-boardgamegeek-20' rel='nofollow'>http://www.amazon.com/Winning-Moves-1194-Classic-Upwords/dp/...</a>;keywords=upwords&amp;qid=1464366613&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;sr=8-1<br/><br/>Hasbro Euro 10x10 version:<br/><a target='_blank' href='http://www.amazon.com/Upwords-The-3D-Word-Building-Game/dp/B01276CYHQ?ie=UTF8&amp=&tag=article-boardgamegeek-20' rel='nofollow'>http://www.amazon.com/Upwords-The-3D-Word-Building-Game/dp/B...</a>;keywords=upwords&amp;qid=1464366613&amp;ref_=sr_ph_1&amp;sr=sr-1<br/><br/>August 2016 will have a new Hasbro version 10x10 game available in the United States.<br/><br/>An app for UPWORDS play is available both for iphone and android devices, by Lonely Star Software, under license from Hasbro.

Ongais, Foyt, Unser, Sneva, Mears, Rutherford etc, every driver that was in the that year's Indy has a card with a color photo on one side and game racing charts on the other side.  One Card set, for an even year Indy race from 1978 through 1986, was included in the box with the other card sets offered through the AH mail order program.<br/><br/>Each driver card has 6 tables on the back. Three of the tables for movement, you chose whether you are going to drive normally, charge or back off and then roll 2 dice, referencing the appropriate table. The result will tell you how far you can move or if you have encountered car trouble. There are 2 trouble tables that can slow you down or knock you out of the race.

The players do this by Trading, Buying, and Leaping with other cards.<br/><br/>Monad / Die 1. Million uses a deck of cards with six colors (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Purple). Half of these are called &quot;Warm&quot; colors (Red, Orange, and Yellow), and the others are &quot;Cool&quot; colors (Green, Blue, and Purple). The majority of cards has one symbol on them (known as &quot;Commons&quot;), but there is one card of each color with 2-5 colors on them (known as &quot;Bis,&quot; &quot;Tris,&quot; &quot;Quads,&quot; and &quot;Quints&quot;). At the start of the game, each player is assigned one of the six colors as their &quot;identity&quot; and is dealt six Commons and one &quot;Bonus&quot; card (which shows three pairs of colors). The Bis, Tris, Quads, and Quints are placed face up in separate piles in the center of the table.<br/><br/>On their turn, a player attempts to get higher numbered cards into their hand. The easiest way is by &quot;Trading.&quot; To trade, a player turns in a pair of cards with the same number of symbols but of opposite colors (one warm and one cool) and takes the top card from the stack with the next highest number of symbols. When they turn in two Quints, they gain a Monad. If the two cards turned in match one of the pairs on their bonus card, they may also draw the top card from each of the lower stacks. They may also use cards of the same color as their Identity as wild cards, which are treated as having any number of symbols.<br/><br/>The player can turn in more than two cards and &quot;Leap&quot; to a higher stack. This allows them to select a card with a higher number of symbols. Finally, they can &quot;Buy&quot; a card. Buying cards uses the numbers located on each card. The player turns in a number of cards which total greater than the number on the card they are after. Monads can be purchased for 80 points.<br/><br/>A player can also draw the top card from the deck but doing so prevents them from taking any other action that turn.<br/><br/>The first player to accumulate a given number of Monads (which varies depending on the number of players in the game) is the winner.<br/><br/>Belongs to the 3M Gamette Series<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["3M early Octix style cover", "3M English Butterbox Edition", "3M English First \"Oversized Butterbox\" edition 1968", "3M English Gamette Edition", "3M German Edition", "Gryphon Games Sackson Collection Edition", "Hexagames German Edition", "Salagames edition"], "average": "6.33822", "name": "Monad", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Set Collection"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "360", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["3M Gamettes", "Sid Sackson Signature Series"]}, "1521": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Robert J.

Each of these knights lists a series of dice pips on the card, some of which are red in color.  These red numbers are the knights defensive abilities, and he will block these numbers if rolled by an opponent during a competition.  For instance, Upollonius Wolkenburg has a 1, 2 and 3 in red.  Thus, he will block one of each of these numbers each time dice are rolled by an opponent in a competition.  Some knights have less numbers in red, but they usually have a greater attack strength, meaning they can roll more dice in combat.  This mechanism borrows very heavily from many role playing and fantasy games.<br/><br/>In addition to these 'defense' numbers and the attack dice chart, each knight card also has charts for prizes won (1 - 15) and damage points (1 - 10).  There are also nice illustrations on each card ... about the only kind thing I can say about the game.<br/><br/>Each player also receives a 'lady' card.  Each lady possesses a number of characteristics, including hair color, build, height and personality.  When granting her favor to a knight (which is indicated by placing a corresponding token onto a knight card), the idea is to seek out a knight who desires similar characteristics in a lady.<br/><br/>The start player challenges an opposing knight with one of his knights.  A challenge cannot be refused.  These two enter battle, which involves each player tossing a number of dice equal to their attack strength into the tournament field.  In mounted combat, any 1's, 2's or 3's thrown strike a blow, unless these are blocked by the opponent.  If any of these dice strike, the knight falls from his horse and the knight suffers hit points equal to the number of blows which were landed.  If only one knight is struck and falls from his horse, the opponent wins and earns a prize for himself and for his lady.  If both knights fall from their horse, then the match continues on foot.  This involves more dice rolling, but 4's, 5's and 6's now strike.  This continues until one knight concedes or reaches 10 damage points, at which time he is out of the tournament (and out of the game).<br/><br/>The next player in turn order then challenges a knight.  This process is repeated until there is only one healthy knight remaining. The round then ends and victory points are doled out to the knight and lady who won the most prizes.

The closer you are to the coast, the more points you score. If you splash down into the water, however, you will score negative points. The further from the shore you are in the water, the more negative points you will suffer. <br/>The board depicts a section of land, followed by a beach and ocean. There is a lake on one space of the land section, and a one-space island in the ocean. The board also has two 'landing' tracks running parallel to each other. The tokens are placed on these tracks once they have leapt from the planes. Finally, the board also has a scoring track to tabulate the points ultimately scored following a round, as well as a cumulative scoring track which runs the perimeter of the board.<br/><br/>Each player loads his or her tokens (which vary with the number of players) into the two airplanes. There are four rows of seats in the airplanes, and where your tokens are positioned will be important when considering the timing of your jumps. Players then each receive six cards plus one 'jump' card. These cards dictate the actions that will occur during the turn. Most of the cards move one of the planes (red or yellow) forward or backward a certain number of spaces. Other cards allow a player to switch seats in or between the planes, cancel any jump attempts that round or blow a jumper off course a space. Finally, the jump card causes one of the player's token to leap from the plane and land on the space directly below where he was seated.<br/><br/>The mechanics are quite simple. Each player lays a card face down, and then all reveal their cards simultaneously. Beginning with the start player (which rotates each round), each player carries out the action his card depicts. However, if a player reveals a 'jump' card, then opponents who played a 'wind' or 'cancel jump' card must reveal them, taking the appropriate action. The 'wind' card can be disastrous, as that player gets to bump the jumper one space up or down. This may have the effect of landing the jumper in the water. Cards played are discarded, with the exception of the 'jump' card, which is retrieved back into the player's hand.<br/><br/>When a token leaps from a plane (due to the play of a 'jump' card), he is placed on the outside track of the landing track. If another token leaps into the same space, it is placed along the inside track. Any other tokens that land on that same space are shoved back to the next empty space on the landing track. This can result in a scoring reduction if the token is being moved further from the coast, but can also be a positive occurrence if this causes the token to be moved onto the land as opposed to falling into the water.<br/><br/>Play continues until all tokens have jumped from the planes. They are then moved one-by-one to the scoring track, beginning with the token furthest from the shore. There is a positive scoring track for those tokens that were fortunate enough to land on solid ground, and a negative scoring track for those jumpers who splashed into the water. The more tokens that successfully landed on the ground, the more points the players closest to the shore will score. The converse is also true!<br/><br/>Once all tokens have been repositioned onto the scoring tracks, each player tallies his final results and these are marked on the cumulative scoring track. This entire process is then repeated two more times and the player with the most cumulative points following the third round is victorious.<br/><br/>"}, "1535": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2758404.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["John Howarth", "Trevor Jones"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1962", "maxplayers": "6", "age": "10", "boardgamepublisher": ["Alga", "Brohm-Parker-Spiele", "Istituto Del Gioco (IDG)", "Majora", "Miro Company", "Parker Brothers", "Schmidt Spiele", "Smeets & Schippers", "Tofa", "Waddington's Games, Inc."], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2758404_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Racing", "Sports"], "description": "A simple racing game where speed and movement is decided by the driver and not the dice.

The game system includes details such as varying weapon ranges, heat generation, and discrete hit locations (torso, arms, legs, etc.). 'Mechs vary greatly by mobility and firepower, and players can choose from provided designs or take the time to create their own 'Mechs from scratch. The base game (reprinted in many different editions) includes an introductory rulebook for new players; recent editions also include quick-start rules for an even faster orientation. The game is typically played on one or more mapsheets or (more recently) mounted map boards, and there are many mapsheet and &quot;hex&quot; (mounted-board) packs available for purchase or even download. Optional rules are also available for hexless play a la many miniatures games. An extensive line of pewter figurines ('Mechs, vehicles, and the like) are available in the United States from Iron Wind Metals. (Many earlier BattleTech figures were produced and sold by Ral Partha, which still handles the figure lines in Europe.)<br/><br/>The main component of the current generation of BattleTech is a series of core rulebooks, the central one being Total Warfare (in print and PDF), which contains the main (tournament-legal) rules for the game. (The 2011 Catalyst reprint is up-to-date in terms of errata fixes.) TechManual (in print and PDF) contains construction rules for 'Mechs and other units. A series of three &quot;advanced rules&quot; books adds on to the standard rules: Tactical Operations (in print and PDF) covers on-planet actions over a period of hours; Strategic Operations (in print and PDF) covers in-system actions over a period of weeks; and Interstellar Operations (forthcoming; 2012?) covers system-level actions over a period of months. The final core rulebook available is A Time of War: The BattleTech RPG (in print and PDF), a revised version of the BattleTech RPG rules, which have previously gone under the names MechWarrior and Classic BattleTech RPG.

The real answers are often even more outrageous than the bluffs, so the game offers plenty of laughs.<br/><br/>The UK version of Absolute Balderdash is a different variation with different questions.  Notably, the UK Absolute Balderdash features a &quot;Law&quot; category, where you complete the law given on the card.

TACTICS II is a direct descendant of this original board wargame.<br/><br/>TACTICS II is sort of like military chess. Different pieces, called &quot;units&quot; in wargames, have different capabilities just like chess pieces. The major difference is that a player can move all his pieces each turn, and after all his pieces are moved, battles are resolved against the enemy units his pieces are next to (adjacent to).<br/><br/>The other major difference between wargames and chess is that wargames have a mapboard, divided into squares or hexagons for movement purposes. TACTICS II has a 22&quot; x 28&quot; mapboard portraying a fictional continent with two countries, Blue and Red. Terrain includes roads, rivers, woods, mountains, beaches, and cities. The Blue Capital can only be reached over a vast plain, bordered on the left by mountains and on the right by woods. The Red Capital is on an island and can only be reached across one of several bridges or by an amphibious invasion.<br/><br/>Game features include special functions for headquarters units, terrain effects, invasions, airborne assaults, weather effects, replacements, isolation, and even nuclear weapons. Units represent infantry, armor, mountain, airborne, headquarters, and amphibious troops. Over 100 counters in all.<br/><br/>TACTICS II was almost always part of the Avalon Hill game line, primarily because it was sold as an introductory wargame for a number of reasons. The rules introduced many basic board wargaming concepts and were relatively low in complexity. The rulebook is divided into a basic game and a tournament game (advanced game). Both are balanced and relatively quick playing. As the opposing armies are identical in size and composition, victory is gained by a combination of logic, foresight, luck, common sense, and skill in military strategy and tactics.<br/><br/>In 1981, an unauthorized hex map version, called Opera\u00e7\u00e3o MX-1, was released in Brazil.

Because the situation is forever changing, there is no single best strategy; however,players must weigh risks against gains with every decision they make and good judgment will pay off.<br/><br/>The game is played on a mapboard showing Africa from Khartoum to Capetown and Lagos to Mombasa. The periphery of this map, showing the territory known ca. 1820, is filled-in; the center is blank. A hexagonal grid is superimposed on the map to regulate movement and to delimit territory explored. In the course of play, each player moves a token (representing his explorer) from explored hexagons to blank hexagons one at a time.; terrain, native tribes and other discoveries within the hexagons are then semi-randomly determined, with allowance made for previous discoveries in adjacent hexagons. The player interacts with the discoveries (e.g. negotiates with new natives for guides) and records them on the mapboard using wax crayons. The mapboard surface is erasable. If the explorer dies before returning to Europe to publish his discoveries, all hexagons which only he has explored will be erased and &quot;subsequent explorers will find that his discoveries were only rumors&quot;; i.e., when other players explore the erased hexagons later they will have to generate new discoveries there.<br/><br/>When explorers do return to civilization, however, they may publish their discoveries, after which they are safe from erasure. Players may also emulate real explorers by withholding some of their discoveries since they will enjoy some advantages when moving through terrain or dealing with natives known only to them. Points are scored for discoveries as they are published and once scored will not be lost if the explorer dies or is retired by his player. A player may retire his explorer at any time and then start a new explorer in Europe.<br/><br/>Before each trip to Africa, explorers will have to raise money to support their expedition. New explorers with no discoveries to their credit must do this by drawing chance cards for several turns until they feel their finances are adequate. Experienced explorers can accelerate this process by publishing discoveries, which allow them to draw additional chance cards.<br/><br/>Originally published by Discovery Games and re-published by Avalon Hill as a more card-based rather than dice-based system.

During that spring and summer, three independent, but simultaneous, dramas unfolded. In the west, the Japanese launched an all-out offensive to capture Imphal. In the center, the Chindits landed in the Japanese rear area. In the east, the Chinese/US forces moved toward Myitkyina against stubborn Japanese defenses. These battles took place in horrible terrain under the most difficult conditions imaginable with troops whose quality ranged from the world&rsquo;s best to the world&rsquo;s worst.<br/><br/>Burma contains British, Indian, US, and Chinese troops of varying qualities with ample opportunities for both sides to attack and defend.<br/><br/>While mainly a British and Indian show, the campaign would end up involving US (Galahad) and Chinese troops as well. Burma is the most markedly different of the OCS games, with a wide variety of unit types and qualities, the extremely dense terrain and lack of roads creating a challenging supply situation for both sides, and a more balanced situation as both sides have opportunities to attack and defend. There is more of the &quot;cool stuff&quot; too, with Galahad, Chindits, Gurkhas, lots of air supply and transport options creating some interesting situations, and the ever-enigmatic and unusual Japanese Army. Imphal-Kohima is by far the most interesting ground campaign of the PTO (from an operational perspective), and it's conversion to OCS is remarkably smooth, with a fairly modest set of game-specific rules.<br/><br/>Unlike some other OCS games, Burma has an excellent range of scenarios, from a couple very short scenarios (1-2 hrs) through to a good selection of longer (6hr) scenarios and on up to 3 monster campaign games (30-60 hrs).<br/><br/>Scenario Info:<br/><br/>    Learning Scenario: 1/8th of Map B; 5 turns<br/>    Short Scenario 1 - Operation Thursday: 1/4 of Map B; 9 turns<br/>    Short Scenario 2 - U-Go: 3/4 map of Map B; 10 turns<br/>    Short Scenario 3 - Merril's Marauders: 3/4 map, but requires both maps to play; 24 turns<br/>    Short Scenario 4 - Sato's Dilemna: 1/2 map of Map A; 11 turns<br/>    Short Scenario 5 - Imphal: 1/2 map of Map A; 17 turns<br/>    Campaign Scenarios 1, 2, and 3 (which use both maps, obviously); 45, 41, and 31 turns respectively<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 1/2 week<br/>Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km<br/>Units: Battalion to Division<br/><br/>Game Inventory (Burma II - printed 2008):<br/>Two 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheets<br/>Three dual-side printed countersheets (2 combat, 1 markers - 840 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 48-page OCS version v4.0 rules booklet<br/>One 40-page Burma II specific rules booklet<br/>Two 4-sided OCS v4.0 Charts &amp; Tables booklets<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Players: 1 or more (also suitable for solitaire and team play)<br/>Playing Time: 1 to 60 hours<br/>Complexity: High<br/>Solitaire Suitability: Moderate<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "Second Bagged edition", "Second Boxed Edition"], "average": "7.8689", "name": "Burma", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "287", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Burma", "Operational Combat Series"]}, "1586": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic277575.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["H.

Each farmer (player) owns a farm consisting of hexes radiating out from the center of the board, and whose boundaries (and therefore, sizes) are initially undefined. The placement of fences -- each of which is shared by the two surrounding farms -- defines the boundaries. Some hexes are clearly going to be in certain farms; others will be fought over (either to acquire or avoid!) fiercely.<br/><br/>The goal is to complete one's own farm by having the fences on both its sides reach the outer edge of the board before the game ends (without which one cannot win), and to have the most enclosed points among all such completed farms (which wins).<br/><br/>The sheep are on thick cardboard disks, printed on one side with values ranging from 5 (the best) down to -3. One sheep can fit onto each board hex.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player gets to do one of several actions:<br/><br/>1) place a sheep blindly from the supply face-down onto an empty board space after secretly looking at it; 2) turn up a face-down sheep tile in place (thereby freezing it for the rest of the game); 3) use the cool wooden sheepdog to blindly &quot;herd&quot; a face-down sheep from one hex to another, where it is then flipped up and frozen; or 4) lay a fence piece on either of the two fences surrounding his farm.<br/><br/>Certain board hexes, symmetrically distributed, act as multipliers for the sheep that ends up in that space.  There are a few special situation rules and a few rules governing fence placement. There are strong elements of bluff and memory in this game.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player's completed farm is filled with pieces (either face-up or down sheep, or the dog).

Each player begins with two of their own unique Doomtroopers imbued their Corporation's special ability.  They make decisions and plan strategies to prevent the Dark Legion and its leader, the vile Nepharite, Alakhai, from conquering the solar system. Each successful mission brings a new one with the modular Citadel and events that can help or hinder you in battle. Each promotion gives credits to access more powerful weaponry!  Grab a Punisher Shortsword and Plasma Carbine to make your mark in the Mutant Chronicles!<br/><br/>Gameplay:  The game begins by choosing which of the 5 players will be the Dark Legion Player for the current mission.  A player fulfills this role by setting their Doomtroopers aside for the current mission and controlling the enemies.  The Dark Legion player can earn promotion points for their inactive Doomtroopers by wounding the other player's Doomtroopers.  Thus, taking a turn as the baddies is not totally thankless.  10 different scenarios are included with the game.<br/><br/>The Corporation players take their Player tray and 2 Doomtrooper miniatures, two Doomtrooper cards and a Secondary Mission card if specified by mission (these allow extra points if the requirements of the card can be met).  The Dark Legion Player sets up the current mission's Citadel layout with the modular boards and gathers his mission specified Force Cards.  The Force cards are deployed in rooms face-down and are revealed when a Doomtrooper enters and the corresponding Dark Legion miniatures are placed on board.  All miniatures may move 3 squares per move action and most figures get 2 actions per turn.  A figure can do one of the following: Move then Attack, Attack then Move, Attack twice or Move twice.  Corporation Players go first.  Order is determined by flipping over a face-down Corporation token.  The revealed Corporation player then takes their turn with both Doomtroopers and the next Corporation token is flipped.  Play is semi-cooperative for the Corporation players as they compete for points, but want the overall mission to succeed.   The weapon card the Doomtrooper has equipped determines whether he can attack long range, close combat or both.  There are various miscellaneous equipment that can be equipped in addition to the weapon (healing kits, laser targeting, Grenade launcher etc...).  Attacks are carried out by rolling dice and comparing the number of hits to the armor value of the target.  If the number of hits exceeds the armor value of the creature it is eliminated.  In addition Doomtroopers can use a Doomtrooper card to affect the game in some way.  These cards list two effects but only one can be used per card and are then discarded.  The possible effects range from modification of combat or movement to messing with your opponents (jamming their gun for example).  After all Corporations have taken their turns it is the Dark Legion players turn.<br/><br/>The Dark Legion(DL) Player at the start of his turn draws the top event card, reads it out loud and follows the instructions.  The DL player then receives the reinforcements listed on the card and places them on the board.  The DL player then looks to see if any Force cards are still face-down. If there are, the player reveals one and places the revealed units in the same room the card was in.  The DL player then takes his actions with all of his creatures.  Play continues in this way until mission is successful or the time runs out and it fails.<br/><br/>Game End: Successful Doomtroopers receive promotion points for the creatures killed in battle and credits specified for the mission.  If they gain rank Doomtroopers improve the combat dice they use and gain extra actions.  With their credits Doomtroopers can purchase improved weaponry and gadgets (Gehenna Puker, Nimrod Autocannon).  The Dark Legion player's inactive Doomtroopers gain 1 promotion point per point of damage inflicted upon the opposing players' Doomtroopers by creatures.<br/><br/>A rare poster-magazine called &quot;Sinkadus&quot; 41# &amp; 42# that was produced by Target Games AB only in Sweden, added an expansion to Siege of the Citadel.

Each hero comes from a different people. The Barbarian has traveled far from the savage north, a land of bitter cold and ferocious warriors. The Wizard hails from the cities of the Empire, the largest and most important of the realms of men. The Dwarf is drawn by the goldlust for which his race is famous. Dwarfs are grim and rather abrupt, but they are good fighters and loyal friends who remember debts of gratitude as readily as debts of coin. The Elf comes from the green woods of Loren where his kin spend their days hunting and making merry, protected from evil by the strange magic of their land. Elves are incredibly quick and agile, and they are also the best archers in the world.<br/><br/>In the Warhammer Quest game the players enter a dark and forbidding dungeon. Together they must face the horrific dangers that wait for them. They will be attacked by monsters such as Orcs, Goblins, Skaven and Minotaurs. Other perils lurk in the darkness: scurrying venomous things like spiders, deadly pit traps, and decayed tunnels that cave in at the slightest touch. If they complete their quest the players will be rewarded with gold, treasure and artefacts of magical power. The more gold and treasure you can discover the better.., and the player whose warrior amasses the greatest fortune has done best of all!<br/><br/>Warhammer Quest is probably unlike other games you have played. Rather than each player competing against the others, all the players must co-operate if they are to win. Also, there is no single board. Instead, the different rooms and corridor sections are clipped together to make a dungeon that is different every time you play. The game rules may seem a little complex at first - but don't worry a lot of the rules are designed to extend the game and are not vital to begin with. The actual game rules you need to play are in this book or printed on the various cards.

By throwing the die, they sail to exotic ports like the Pearl Coast, the Jewel Coast and the Spice Islands. When they arrive at a port they pay a trading fee and draw a card which tells them what cargo they have bought. Cargoes range from codfish and coal to precious spices, pearls and diamonds,!<br/><br/>Players might also draw a pirate card while trading. They then have to decide whether to rob other players - or continue as honest merchants. Players could also draw a warship card - in which case any pirate who attacks them or anyone else nearby will be in for a nasty shock! The top card in each player&rsquo;s pack shows whether they are merchants, pirates or warships. Since they don&rsquo;t show each other their cards - no-one really knows what they are (until someone decides to turn pirate by attacking another ship).<br/><br/>Players who are robbed can get their revenge by calling in the Navy and chasing the pirate down before he or she can reach Home Port! Things are made even more exciting by the &lsquo;Treasure Chest&rsquo; cards which players draw every time they roll a &lsquo;one&rsquo;. They then find out whether they have landed without any wind in the doldrums, - or been blown by a hurricane to a distant port, - or have found buried treasure - or other such twists of fortune!'<br/><br/>"}, "1643": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jean du Po\u00ebl"], "poll": [], "name": "Romeo und Julia", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Trick-taking"], "yearpublished": "2000", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": ["Celebrities: Shakespeare", "Cities: Verona"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic87371_t.jpg", "average": "4", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Historien Spiele Galerie (Historien Spielegalerie)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic87371.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "18", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "A lavishly produced trick taking game themed around some play that no one has ever heard of.

You do this by spamming mailing lists. The more closely related the mailing list is to the type of scam you're trying to pull, the easier it is to score.<br/><br/>Scams come in 4 types - sex, internet, money and free stuff. The text and art flavor are quite wonderful. Of course the sex scams appeal the most - highlights were the Virtual Jellorama, Walter's Wankery and Disgusting Dog Tricks. If you're geeky, some of the internet scams are witty. All the standard 'make money doing nothing' and free stuff scams are there as well.<br/><br/>You play scam cards in front of you (up to 5) and then play mail-out cards (spams) trying to lure people in. There are a number of mailing lists of various sizes in the middle for anyone to mail to, plus each player has some private mailing lists that only they can spam. The action is to play a 'mail' card, nominating both a scam and the list that you're mailing the scam offer to. If you roll a d6 less &lt;= the size of the list, you succeed, and that scam scores a point. If you roll way under (4 or more), your scam scores 2 points. Some lists specialize in one of the 4 scam types ... if your scam and the list matches, you get a modifier of +2 making it easier to score, plus the mail-out cards have modifiers between 0 and +5.<br/><br/>Simple so far, but every time a mailing list gets spammed, it decreases in size by 1 (1 million thematically which equals 1 on the die) - these are subscribers getting disgruntled by the amount of spam they're receiving who leave the list.<br/><br/>The winner is the first person to get 20 points across all their scams, or who gets a single scam of 12 points BUT it's only checked at the start of your next turn.<br/><br/>A turn consists of 3 actions surrounding 2 decks - list cards and action cards. An action is pick up a card, play a card or merge 2 lists (making one bigger list you can then mail to). The action cards consist of scams, mail-outs or hardware cards. Hardware cards are played in front of you and allow you to break the game rules in a prescribed way (eg can mail other's private lists). Mail-out cards also list special effects which vary from mundane to wildly powerful but generally allow you to hose other players. When you play one, you say whether you're mailing or playing the special effect.<br/><br/>To the game play itself. You try to get a mail-out going every turn (you're only allowed one) and pick a scam / list combination that gives you the best chance of scoring 2 points rather than 1 point. If you only get 1 point, you may well be falling off the pace. You're generally picking up at least one card each turn, and this can be a slow process as any special action needs to be read and understood to work out whether you want to use the card as a mail-out or for the special effect. So it's not the fastest game in the world. These hostage cards also make it a big hit the leader game. If you're going to make a dash for the lead have plenty of protection cards because you have to maintain your winning score for a full round before you win - everyone gets a shot at you.<br/><br/>"}, "1648": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Kan-U-Go", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1934", "usersrated": "41", "maxplayers": "7", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic196443_t.jpg", "average": "4.89024", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Jarvis Porter Ltd", "John Sands Pty Ltd", "Milton Bradley", "Waddington's Games, Inc."], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic196443.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Jarvis Porter Registered Badge Edition", "Jarvis Porter White Letter Tiles Edition", "John Sands Australian Edition", "T G Porter Snakeskin-look Box", "Waddingtons Games Edition 1985", "Waddingtons Games Edition 1988"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Word Game"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "An old crossword card game from the 30s, I was given my copy of Kan-U-Go in 1975.

The object of the game is to have that character cast a magic Ring into Mount Doom. Along the way from the Shire to their final destination, players have opportunities to pick up *several* Rings. These rings may be spent to get past opposing creatures. However, to win the game, a player must have at least one Ring when they reach Mount Doom.<br/><br/>Cards allow a player to move 1-3 clear spaces ahead, to defeat Orcs or Nazgul, to bypass the various opposing creatures on the board, or to traverse mountain terrain, dictate movement. Cards are also useful for stealing rings from an opponent, relocating Nazgul on the board, and other functions.

Was it Tordek in the Dragon's Lair with the Flaming Battle Axe? Or Mialee in the Dungeon with the Staff of Power?<br/><br/>In Clue: Dungeons &amp; Dragons, a group of heroic adventurers has been called to the Archmage's castle, but one of those heroes isn't who he appears to be; one of the heroes is a doppelganger, a monster that can look like anyone! In the darkest part of the night, the doppelganger kills the Archmage, triggering a spell that seals the castle until the monster is caught. Now, in the grand tradition of Clue, the six suspects must determine which one of them is the doppelganger: Regdar the Human Fighter, Tordek the Dwarf Fighter, Lidda the Halfling Rogue, Mialee the Elf Wizard, Ember the Human Monk or Nebin the Gnome Wizard. The heroes try to figure out Who killed the Archmage, Where the crime occurred, and Which magical weapon was used.<br/><br/>For the most part, gameplay in Clue: Dungeons &amp; Dragons is identical to standard Clue as players roll a die, move into different locations on the game board, then make accusations against a particular combination of who/where/which cards and a particular opponent; if that opponent holds one of those cards, she must reveal it to you. Eventually someone will narrow down the possibilities and make an accusation as to exactly which cards have been removed from the game; if correct the player wins, and otherwise she's out of the game and play continues for everyone else.<br/><br/>One optional element in Clue: Dungeons &amp; Dragons is the Wandering Monsters deck. After landing on a &quot;claw-marked&quot; space on the game board, the player draws the top card from this deck, then battles the creature shown by rolling a die. If she wins, she gains a magic item that confers a single-use special ability, such as looking at a random card from an opponent's hand or taking an extra turn. If she loses, her token is placed in the center of the game board, from where it will take several turns to move back into a room (and get back into the game).<br/><br/>"}, "1664": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic862576.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Alex Randolph"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1999", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "4", "boardgamepublisher": ["Drei Magier Spiele"], "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic862576_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Racing"], "description": "A motorcycle racing game for young children with beautiful wooden pieces.

They then take turns rolling dice and moving their counters around the board.<br/><br/>When a player lands on certain squares, he is paid for all aircraft he has on a particular route. The more aircraft there are on a single route, the lower the payment received for each aircraft. For example; on the New York to Seattle route, one aircraft will make $40,000. If there are 5 aircraft on the route, then each aircraft will earn $15,000, for a total of $75,000. All players receive payment for their aircraft on the route regardless of who landed on the square. Other squares on the board require the players to make certain payments (such as landing fees or ground service charges).<br/><br/>The players are also required to perform maintenance on their aircraft. Airport cards can be drawn which give individual players bonuses (such as a mail cargo route) or penalties (such as a strike). The players also have the option of buying or leasing new aircraft or of selling old aircraft back to the bank. The first player to reach a net worth of one million dollars is the winner.<br/><br/>This game is another variant on the venerable Monopoly game. The varying amount of payment based on the number of aircraft on a route is actually somewhat realistic, but otherwise it has about as much to do with how airlines are actually run as Monopoly does with actual real estate investment. But the flavor is good, and the game is interesting to play and reasonably fast.

After selecting one of the six missions provided, you will send your platoon into operations, where your vehicle will move as you wish... until the sequenced action rounds are triggered by the shriek of an incoming 88mm anti-tank shell, and then the fun begins.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>210 Counters (1 Large Sheet)<br/>1 22&quot; x 32 &quot; Map<br/>1 Rules Booklet<br/>1 Paragraph Booklet<br/>79 Unit Characteristics Cards<br/>1 Mission Cartridge<br/>1 Cartridge View Sleeve<br/>1 Platoon Record Sheet Pad<br/>1 8&quot; x 22&quot; Display Sheet<br/>2 Decimal Dice<br/>1 Counter Storage Tray<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Victory Games edition"], "name": "Open Fire", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "5.42409", "usersrated": "110", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Ambush! solitaire wargame system", "Solitaire Games", "Solitaire Wargames"]}, "1673": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Howard L.

Dawn breaks on the combined might of four Legions arrayed on the heights of Mount Scopus, starting their methodical advance across the valley to the ancient walled city of Jerusalem.  Siege lines have been secured tight about the city.  There is no hope of escape.  The besieged must persist behind their stout walls or perish before a vengeful Rome.  Five grueling years of campaigning in Judea is now culminating in the Siege of Jerusalem.<br/><br/>But the fortified city defies even the might of Rome.  The thick walls atop the steep slopes literally bristle with natural and manmade fortifications.  It will take all of Rome's considerable engineering skills to winch their war machines into position for an assault up the slopes to the city.  Only here in the north plain can the city's walls be taken by escalade.  The rhythmic approach of the Legions is muted by the rumble of the siege engines as an assortment of towers, rams, and artillery precede the maniples.  The distant walls seethe with the frenzied activity of an alerted populace as the antagonists draw near.  This majestic view is abruptly halted by the blare of trumpets which soon gives way to the cacophony of the clash of arms and screams of the dying.<br/><br/>Morning turns to dusk before the walls are breached and the weary legions exact their vengeance.  The sky turns bright again, aglow in the reflection of a thousand fires as the northern outskirts burn.  But what price victory?  Another day such as this will break the Roman Army and only one of the city's ten walled sections has fallen this day.  They will have to find another way.  Shafts must be dug to undermine the walls or earthen ramps built with which to scale them.  It will be a long campaign.<br/><br/>This is The Siege of Jerusalem...An epic battle simulation with all the trappings and majesty of a Cecil B. DeMille film spectacular.  Facing the greatest army of antiquity, the Judeans must rely on the stoutness of their walls to halt the unbeatable Roman legions and therein lies the fascination:  the immovable object vs the unstoppable force.  As Eliezar Ben Yair, leader of the Zealots, you must conduct a skilled defense of the city's ever shrinking perimeter - exacting from the Romans a price so terrible that they will be forced to lift their siege - or break out to continue your struggle for freedom at Massada.  As Titus, commander of the Roman army, you must decide when, where and how to renew the assault - gauging your troop needs against the progress of your siege works and the press of time caused by outside threats.  More than just conducting tactical combat, the Roman must formulate an overall strategic plan for the conduct of the siege.<br/><br/>Vastly revised from its 1st &amp; 2nd edition printing from Historical Perspectives in the 70's, Siege of Jerusalem now boasts two-sided counters, a continuous combat system, a strategic interphase for conducting the entire siege, and the morale / panic rules so important in portraying ancient warfare.  An Introductory Scenario depicting the abortive assault of Gallus with the XII Legion three years previous allows players to learn how to handle a legion in a single day's play while training for eventual participation in the conduct of the epic siege.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.05086", "name": "The Siege of Jerusalem (Third Edition)", "playingtime": "300", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "481", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Ancient Rome", "Cities: Jerusalem (Israel)", "Solitaire Games", "Solitaire Wargames"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Guns, Dice, Butter Episode XI: Jan 8, 2013"]}, "1711": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic172201.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Randall C.

There are six different styles of performers, and at different times in the game, public opinion will favour different styles.  Public preference is determined by dealing out cards from a special deck.  The current opinion is always known, and a possible (but not necessarily accurate) forecast of future preferences is also provided.<br/><br/>Each turn, public opinion changes (sometimes to match the forecast, and sometimes into something completely random), then players use a bidding system to acquire contracts with performers.  Once contracts have been negotiated, profit is calculated depending on how well performers match the public's desires.<br/><br/>By the time twelve turns have been played (and possibly one or two turns sooner), the game will come to an end and the player with the highest score is declared the winner.<br/><br/>The game was originally published by the designer in 1985.

All the action is governed by dice, yet there is no luck involved. The dice simply establish the situation. It is up to the players to act upon it. A game with endless variety.<br/><br/>Playable by any number of people, from one to a hundred, Moonstar combines numbers calculations, memory, and quick-thinking into a fast-playing, action-packed, exciting contest of pure skill.<br/><br/>The board represents the twelve constellations (stars) of the Zodiac and the playing pieces represent moons and planets. Each game consists of a number of rounds of play. In each round, the board and playing pieces are first setup by one of the players. Then the dice are thrown. A one-minute auction period begins. Each player may bid any number of times in the auction or not at all. Each bid, however, must be higher than the previous one. When the one-minute runs out, the highest bidder plays that round.<br/><br/>The play of the round also lasts one minute. A player plays a round by placing one die on each moon on the, board and then moving that moon (and die) a number of stars equal to the number of the die. The die is then removed and the moon may not be moved again. This procedure is followed for each moon. The player must move each moon before the time runs out, or those moons which have not been moved may not move.<br/><br/>The player's score is then totaled to see if he has made his bid, by scoring a number of points for each moon, depending on which stars and planets they have landed on, If a player makes his bid, he scores a number of points equal to his bid. If he fails, he scores nothing. Rounds are setup and played in this manner until one player has scored enough points to win.<br/><br/>But this is only the beginning. Moonstar is actually twelve games in one. Game One is simply the Basic Game. Games Two-Twelve each change one or more parts of Game One, or add something to it. They introduce things like challenging bids, side bets, more moons, more dice, different planet values, no planets. and advanced scoring methods.<br/><br/>Includes:<br/><br/>    16&quot; x 16&quot; gameboard<br/>    15 moon pieces<br/>    21 planet pieces<br/>    1 minute sand timer<br/>    11 6-sided dice<br/>    rulebook<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Corona<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Orbit<br/>    Ricochet Robots<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Avalon Hill first edition"], "name": "Moonstar", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Betting/Wagering", "Dice Rolling"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "75", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "average": "5.0868"}, "1715": {"boardgamedesigner": ["David Tennes"], "average": "5.30465", "poll": [], "name": "Od", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Betting/Wagering"], "yearpublished": "1985", "usersrated": "43", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic253833_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Jean Baer", "Jeff Lee"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Avalon Hill"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic253833.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Avalon Hill First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Components<br/><br/>62 card deck <br/>2 dice <br/>An od is an element of theoretical force.

As in the real world, changing conditions require each player to make constant decisions after considering his company's financial resources - and what he expects his opponents to make - against the cost of alternative protective strategies.<br/><br/>The Iranian oil situation of early '79 is a classic real-life example.  Iran furnishes less than 7% of America's petroleum needs.  Yet its unavailability has done more to devalue the dollar against gold than any economic crises since the depression of 1939. Why so, you may ask.<br/><br/>Playing Foreign Exchange will give you insight into this question, and you'll have fun doing so because the game focuses on the interplayer relationships.  Without such interplay relationships, no game is fun to play.  With it, Foreign Exchange might just be the greatest money game to come along since Monopoly.<br/><br/>Ironically, it doesn't come with any money.  All financial transactions are recorded on a variety of accounting pads included.  If you're into pencils, you'll love this game (some enterprising money -market enthusiasts have already programmed this game on computer).<br/><br/>You - as company head - decide where in the world (literally) you want to establish sales and manufacturing offices.  This is done at the beginning through a round of trading City Cards among players until everyone is satisfied they've outsmarted their opponents.<br/><br/>From this point on, a variety of situations and happenstances will determine likely changes in currency rates.  You - the manufacturer - must plan the strategies you think best to maximize gains.<br/><br/>Foreign Exchange was designed by a professional money-management expert and executive officer of the leading financial institution.  What is duck soup to him, however, might be unfathomable to the novice.  That's why the game comes in three versions: a &quot;Beginning&quot; version for game buffs intrigued by money games; the &quot;Intermediate&quot; game for those with a cursory knowledge of what's going on with foreign currency; and the &quot;Expert&quot; game for those people who really have a yen for this sort of thing.<br/><br/>Includes:<br/>2-piece fold-out game board<br/>Foreign Exchange Worksheet pad<br/>Net Worth Worksheet pad<br/>Hedging Cost Worksheet pad<br/>24 City Cards<br/>4 Borrowing Cost cards<br/>16 Currency Exchange cards<br/>16 Risk cards<br/>5 player tokens<br/>40 colored markers for 4 different colors<br/>2 6-sided dice<br/>Rules<br/><br/>"}, "1719": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic152928.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Greg Costikyan"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1985", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["James Talbot"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Avalon Hill"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic152928_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Fantasy", "Wargame"], "description": "Two-player boardgame of warfare and quest in a fantasy universe.

There were 9 games in this series, which were released near the end of the 3M venture into the gaming market.<br/><br/>The game is extremely simple, yet requires quite a bit of 'bluffing' in order to win.  Each player begins with six metal pawns along the back row of a 6x6 grid.  The board fits snuggly into the box itself and is quite sturdy.  The game is, as is the entire Gamette series, ideal for bringing along while traveling.<br/><br/>Each player secretly places a teeny magnet under two of his pawns.  The object is to be the first player to maneuver one of these 'magnet-bearing' pawns to the opposite side of the board.  If you manage to accomplish this feat, you win.<br/><br/>Movement is simple.  You simply move one of your pawns one space to an adjacent space ... vertically, horizontally or diagonally.  If this lands you atop an opponent's pawn, you are both 'frozen' and can no longer move.  If you make the mistake of moving one of your 'magnet' pawns onto an opponent, he instantly wins.  &quot;Well&quot;, you say, &quot;Why wouldn't I just check the pawn to make sure it wasn't carrying a magnet before making such a questionable move?&quot;.  The rules allow for this, but if you do check, you are prohibited from 'freezing' an opponent that round.  So, it's best to remember which two of your pawns are carrying magnets.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the game ends as soon as one player manages to get a magnet-bearing pawn to the opposite side of the board.  If both players fail to accomplish this, the game is a draw.<br/><br/>The game is very simple and the primary tactic is 'bluff'.  Are you going to be bold and move one of your 'magnet' pawns to the front, figuring your opponent will guess that this cannot possibly be your magnet pawn as he could freeze it too easily?  Or, do you protect your magnet pawns and try to create a path that it can squeeze by your opponent's pawns and scoot to the opposite side?  As with most bluff-style games, there's some guesswork and plain old luck involved, but there is still enough maneuvering and tactics to keep it interesting.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition (3M Gamette)"], "name": "Evade", "playingtime": "10", "average": "5.72982", "usersrated": "57", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["3M Gamettes"]}, "1736": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic11292.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Edward Campbell", "Charles Johnson", "Alan Merrett", "Aly Morrison"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1986", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Christos Achilleos"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Altar Games", "Games Workshop Ltd."], "maxplaytime": "240", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic11292_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Expansion for Base-game", "Exploration", "Fantasy", "Fighting"], "description": "This is the second expansion set for Talisman - The Magical Quest Game.

An ancient bearded man wearing a pointed hat and carrying a staff topped with a crescent moon bowed down towards Festral and his retinue. Fanrax, the Malicious. At the mention of his name, an evil-looking man adorned with skull symbols and toying with a wickedly sharp dagger gave a sneering smile at the group. Boroush, the Storm Master. With sweep of his oaken staff, a ragged and bearded figure greeted the refugees. And finally, Grawshak, Orc Shaman of the Northern Tribes. The last of the four Lieutenants, an Orc decorated in skins, feathers and skulls, carrying a massive totem wand growled what might have been a greeting or a curse at the party. I believe that these four Sorcerers will succeed where you have so miserably failed. And it is they who will punish you for your failure. With this final word, Morcar disappeared into the shadows. From here he watched with great satisfaction as his four sorcerous Lieutenants erased all trace of Festral and his followers. Mocar smiled. These were indeed the ones who would finally destroy the Emperor&rsquo;s Heroes forever.<br/><br/>Expands<br/><br/>    HeroQuest<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["MB Giochi Italian first edition", "MB Jeux French First Edition", "MB Juegos Spanish Edition", "MB Spellen Dutch Edition", "MB Spiele German First Edition", "Milton Bradley English First Edition"], "average": "7.41079", "name": "HeroQuest: Wizards of Morcar", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Role Playing", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["HeroQuest"], "usersrated": "403", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["HeroQuest", "Warhammer Fantasy Board Games"]}, "1768": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3251870.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Chuck Kennedy", "Bruce Lund"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1986", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": ["MB Giochi", "MB Jeux", "MB Juegos", "MB Spellen", "MB Spiele", "Milton Bradley"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3251870_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Adventure", "Children's Game", "Racing"], "description": "A plastic tiki idol is placed in the raised middle of a molded, 3d board, where it can rotate freely.

The computer game version is notably considered the forerunner of the Heroes of Might and Magic series of computer and video games. A sequel to the original computer game, called King's Bounty: The Legend was released in 2008.<br/><br/>The computer game's origin began with fighting mechanics that were meant to have a similar flavor to that of the Avalon Hill board game Titan, but the computer game lacked a story-line or theme. At the same time as this computer development, the author of the King's Bounty board game was wrapping up the development of the board game, which at the time had a working title of &quot;Bounty Hunter.&quot; New World Computing decided to adopt a storyline and theme similar to that of the board game being prepared for production by Task Force Games, which New World Computing owned.<br/><br/>New World Computing shut down development at Task Force Games and transferred ownership of the company prior to the board game production completing, which delayed its release. The major remaining component that had to be completed prior to release was final production and layout of the rule book, which is why interior artwork changed from that produced for other components. The cover graphic, already completed and originally contracted for the board game and then adopted by the computer game, remained unchanged.

You can throw allies in front of the monsters as cannon fodder to protect your investigator.  You then decide what cards you are going to keep in your hand (each investigator has a minimum and a maximum number of cards that must be kept) and draw back to 13 for the next round.

It uses strategy cards and a point-to-point map similar to GMT's award winning For the People and Paths of Glory. Players maneuver and fight over a map stretching from Northern Virginia to Canada. As the leader of French or British forces in North America, you will need to defend your frontier, raid your enemy's frontier, build fortification networks through the harsh wilderness, recruit Indian allies, besiege forts and fortresses, and deal with events occurring in Europe that are above and beyond your control.<br/><br/>Wilderness War includes a deck of strategy cards for conducting campaigns and incorporating the many events and personalities of the war. The French player can recruit up to sixteen different Indian tribes as allies, secure a continental alliance in Europe against Great Britain, sortie his squadron at Louisbourg, force a ministerial crisis in London, and work toward draining support for the war from the provincial assemblies. The British player can recruit Mohawks and Cherokees, plan for and conduct amphibious operations, implement a global strategy via William Pitt, destroy the French fleet at Quiberon Bay, and expel the Acadians.

First published in the mid-'70s it was way ahead of its time. The game works by alternating stock dealing rounds and operating rounds. Stock dealing rounds allow players to buy shares in the available railway companies. Operating rounds allow the presidents of those companies to build track, run trains &amp; generate revenue for shareholders.<br/><br/>This basic system has been much copied and is an integral part of all 18xx games.<br/><br/>The original board covered the southern half of Britain, from the south coast to Darlington. In 1981 a northern board was published covering northern Britain &amp; Scotland.<br/><br/>Where 1829 differs from most others in the 18xx series is the means by which track is laid. Companies each have a token on the board called a Survey Party. Track is laid by moving the company's Survey token and placing a track tile in the area just vacated... if it is still vacant. This mechanism was discarded in the later 18xx titles, and creates much more of a tactical tile-laying game. It also slows down the game, and 1829 is one of the longer 18xx titles. A typical game can take anything from 4 to 10 hours to play.<br/><br/>In 1994 Francis Tresham published 1825, which is largely a modular version of 1829 with simpler rules and a few other enhancements. It plays quite differently from 1829, though, as 1829 was always about competition for routes.<br/><br/>The board gaming hobby has in its history a few landmark games, which redefine a part of board games in general, or even spawn an entire genre. 1829 is just such a landmark.<br/><br/>Expanded By:<br/><br/>    MSK 1 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    MSK 2 Extension Kit for 1829 (Southern & Northern boards)<br/>    MSK 3 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    MSK 5 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    MSK 6 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    1829 Conversion Kit<br/>    1829 Northern Board<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["Hartland Trefoil First Edition"], "average": "7.0643", "name": "1829", "playingtime": "360", "boardgamemechanic": ["Commodity Speculation", "Route/Network Building", "Stock Holding"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["1829 Conversion Kit", "MSK 1 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)", "MSK 2 Extension Kit for 1829 (Southern & Northern boards)", "MSK 3 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)", "MSK 5 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)", "MSK 6 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)"], "usersrated": "200", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["18xx"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Ludology Episode 74 - Boardgame Wonderland"]}, "1824": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1175306.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jeffrey Breslow", "Howard J.

This boxed game consists of 16 miniatures, various room and corridor tiles, cardboard doors with stand-ups, and some dungeon dressings represented by die cut cardboard pieces. The aim is to complete the task of each scenario given in the scenario booklet. One player is the Dungeon Master and sets up the rooms and monsters within when the other players reach them; the instructions are very specific about how to place the monsters, traps or items they encounter. Players are cooperative and do not compete against each other. Of course the players won't see the adventure booklet in advance or during the game, only the game master. All the players are knights of different colors (red, blue, green, and yellow). The same four colors are used for the plastic miniatures of: 4 orcs with bows, 4 trolls with clubs, and 4 Dragon Lords with swords.<br/>Between each scenario may the players increase their rank, depending on how many points they have collected during the scenario. They get points depending on which monsters they have killed plus one extra for a successfully done scenario. In the Dungeons are there monsters, traps, magic items and other stuff. Overall, the designers do a decent job of making the scenarios entertaining given a limited amount material in the game. Each turn, a new event card is overturned and strange things take place. This is fun at first but becomes predictable in later games.<br/>The dicing and combat system uses colored dice with different probabilities of scoring a hit - similar to Heroquest's Skulls and shields except that they are just circles on the dice and represent more of a yes/no answer when rolling. The game is slightly more advanced than Heroquest in that players can advance in levels similar to dungeons and dragons. As you increase in levels, you switch color of dice when attacking and defending, thus increasing your chances to score a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;hit&quot; result on the dice. Otherwise the game is very similar to HeroQuest in general.<br/>Heartbreaker Hobbies produced a couple of lead elf miniatures designed for use with Dragonfire. At the same time, they put out a rare poster/magazine called &quot;Symmetry&quot; #1 that included two new magic items for the game, stats for two elf characters, and a short scenario using all of this with the Dragonfire game. One would assume that consumer response was lacking given that no attention was given to the Dragonfire game in later issues of Symmetry and the game went into obscurity. Still, the game could be used for a couple of night's gaming, especially if introducing children to D&amp;D style gaming or if one wanted to pirate the minis and room pieces to use with other game systems.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["Casper Finnish edition", "English edition", "Heartbreaker English Edition", "Spanish edition", "Swedish edition"], "average": "5.88421", "name": "Dragonfire", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Modular Board", "Role Playing"], "age": "9", "usersrated": "57", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Dragons"]}, "1862": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Marco Silles"], "poll": [], "name": "Avalon", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Set Collection", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "1994", "usersrated": "27", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic223231_t.jpg", "average": "5.12222", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Fun Connection"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic223231.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Medieval", "Negotiation"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "There are separate cards to determine the course of the tournament, according to the number of players.

There are Revolt and Cannon cards.  The remaining cards are Development cards, each rated from 1 to 6.  On your turn, you draw a card and play or discard one.  The deck of a little over a hundred cards is played through and then everyone scores.  Once the deck is exhausted, play continues until everyone's hand is also exhausted.  Once your hand drops below four cards, there are some limitations on card play that come into effect.<br/><br/>When developing a Territory you own, you ideally would play a 1, then a 2, and so on up to a 6.  The developments must be played in increasing numerical sequence, but they need not be consecutive.  At the end of the game, a territory scores the number of development cards on it times its basic multiplier (1&times;, 2&times; or 3&times;) - so an undeveloped territory is worthless.  If you managed to have a sequence of at least four consecutive developments on the territory, you score a sizable bonus.<br/><br/>Revolt cards prevent a territory from being developed or attacked; they also cancel an existing revolt card (there are only 8 of those in the deck).  It is sometimes good strategy to play a revolt on a territory of your own to prevent it from being attacked.<br/><br/>Cannon cards are used to attack other players' territories; you play a cannon face down, and so does the defender.  Both reveal their cards and add a die roll.  The attacker's total must beat the defender's for the attack to succeed.  When it does, you roll a die and this indicates how many cards you plunder from that territory.  If that roll is high enough, you can even steal the territory itself.  Plundered cards must be allocated to your territories right away or discarded.<br/><br/>Cannon can also be used, if rated four or better, to empty one of your territories from its development cards so as to redeploy them - in effect, you are raiding yourself.<br/><br/>A number of small variant rules are supplied in the rule book.

Besides Babylon 5, there was Hercules, Xena, and Star Trek. The Babylon 5 game was apparently derived from the unpublished Galactic Empires board game, based on the CCG of the same name --Companion Games (Galactic Empires' publisher) became Component Game Systems in the process.<br/><br/>The basic idea is that each player need only buy his part of the game, representing in this case a specific political entity from the Babylon 5 universe. Players sit down at the same table and put their components in common to have a game. Pretty cool.<br/><br/>In the Babylon 5 game, you take control of a certain faction which is trying to gain power in the galaxy. You play the role of an ambassador on board Babylon 5. You explore the vast stretches of space, lead huge fleets into battle, and control the economy of your faction. There are several ways to achieve victory ranging from economic growth to all out militaristic control of the universe. Diplomacy is not to be neglected either, as the more powerful game changes are brought up in Babylon 5 council vote to be decided.<br/><br/>You construct your playing 'board' using hexagonal shaped pieces that come with the game. The various pieces are <br/>different and can represent a multitude of things so that the game is different every time you play. In addition to the board and the ships that move on it, there are cards. Players may buy cards allowing special actions above and beyond the normal game, like an extra move or more EPs. You can create decks for each player as per CCGs, or you can just draw from a common deck after handing out the empire specific cards.<br/><br/>Using your faction's wealth and resources you play the game and explore the map. You search for planets to colonize and possibly conquer. Use your fleets to engage in battles and use characters to assist you in reaching your faction's goals. The choices are yours and will decide if your faction is successful.<br/><br/>The game does a very good job of recreating the B5 universe, with play action matching pretty closely the series' happenings. In terms of mechanics, it is similar to Twilight Imperium and Les Cochons de l'espace.<br/><br/>There are two core sets, although CGS initially intended five (one for each of the show's seasons). They are the 2258 and 2259 Core Sets. The first was published in two formats, the 1997 first printing (Limited Edition; CB5-101) using a smaller, unimpressive box (they were in a hurry to get it to the store shelves by Christmas of that year), whilst the 1998 second printing (CB5-001) came in a beautiful large box (allowing room for the storage of extra sets) labeled as &quot;Babylon 5: The Board Game&quot;. The 2259 Core Set (CB5-102) was only published in the big box format. The core sets include the Earth Alliance, Narn Regime, Centauri Republic and Minbari factions, which were each available separately (although the core sets include some extra cards and stuff beyond the combination of the four individual Starter Kits). There is supposedly enough difference between the 2258 and 2259 core sets to warrant buying both, although I haven't received my 2259 set yet so I can't be sure.<br/><br/>Component Game Systems has now disappeared from the face of the earth, and even their domain name (<a target='_blank' href='http://www.c-g-s.com' rel='nofollow'>www.c-g-s.com</a>) has been recycled by some unrelated outfit.<br/><br/>Part of the Component Game System.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition 1998", "English first edition", "English large box second edition 1998"], "average": "5.78061", "name": "Babylon 5 Component Game System: Core Sets", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Modular Board", "Tile Placement", "Variable Player Powers", "Voting"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["Babylon 5 Component Game System: 2258 Edition League of Worlds Starter Kit", "Babylon 5 Component Game System: 2258 Edition Vorlon Empire Starter Kit", "Babylon 5 Component Game System: 2258 Starter Kit \u2013 Centauri", "Babylon 5 Component Game System: 2258 Starter Kit \u2013 Earth", "Babylon 5 Component Game System: 2258 Starter Kit \u2013 Minbari", "Babylon 5 Component Game System: 2258 Starter Kit \u2013 Narn", "Babylon 5 Component Game System: 2259 Edition Psi Corps Starter Kit", "Babylon 5 Component Game System: 2259 Edition Shadow Starter Kit", "Babylon 5 Component Game System: Reinforcements Pack #1", "Babylon 5: The Board Game \u2013 2259 Starter Kit \u2013 Centauri", "Babylon 5: The Board Game \u2013 2259 Starter Kit \u2013 Earth", "Babylon 5: The Board Game \u2013 2259 Starter Kit \u2013 Minbari", "Babylon 5: The Board Game \u2013 2259 Starter Kit \u2013 Narn"], "usersrated": "196", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["CTGs (Collectible Token Games)", "TV Series: Babylon 5"]}, "1875": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic371158.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Bernd Kienitz"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1972", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Bernd Kienitz"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Hallmark Games", "Lakeside", "Otto Maier Verlag", "Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic371158_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Maze"], "description": "In Isolation, the &quot;Don't Get Stranded&quot; game, the board is a 6x8 grid of removable squares.

Each has specific thematic elements, which are consistent across editions and descendant games.  The other currently legal factions include the Spider, Mantis, and an unaligned ronin stronghold.<br/><br/>The Rokugan setting has been changed over the years by participation in the storyline tournaments for the L5R CCG.<br/><br/>Legend of the Five Rings is different from other collectible card games due to the concept of Clan loyalty.  The Clans of the game are what you build your deck around, and the communities that have built up around the Crane Clan, Lion Clan, etc are the backbone of the game.  When you say &quot;I'm a Crab player&quot; you instantly find yourself with hundreds and thousands of clan-mates who are there to help you become a better player.  When one member of the Clan wins, all benefit.<br/><br/>L5R was the first CCG to introduce cards that players directly influenced. These are still a core part of the game.<br/><br/>The L5R CCG has spun off a number of related games: <br/><br/>     Clan War, a miniatures game.<br/>     Diskwars: Legend of the Five Rings, a Rokugan-themed set of the Diskwars tabletop combat game.<br/>     Legend of the Five Rings: Art of War, an as-yet unpublished wargame set in Rokugan.<br/>     Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Game<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>As of 2006, only the CCG and Clan War have had storyline tournaments. Though the RPG players have been heavily involved in the ongoing plot in recent years.<br/><br/>In 2008, L5R held the first &quot;Mega-Game&quot; which incorporated various methods of competition for the Clans and their supporters, not only in CCG form, but in contests (art, writing, poster-design, etc.), community work (charity, fundraising, food-drives), and more. The Dragon Clan ultimately won the first mega-game, and as such earned the privilege of having the next Empress come from their clan.<br/><br/>In 2009, L5R released its first graphic novel, Death at Koten, which also included exclusive story-themed cards for the CCG.<br/><br/>Also in 2009, L5R released The Imperial Gift the first completely free expansion in CCG history.<br/><br/>In 2010 L5R celebrated its 15th Anniversary with many major events, new prizes, more free cards, and a special flashback set that brought back some of the most popular cards in the history of the game. 2010 also saw the largest World Championships event at Gen Con in the past 7 years.<br/><br/>2011 saw the release of War of Honor, an all new tile-based multiplayer format for L5R that comes with 4 pre-constructed decks.<br/><br/>In september 2015, AEG and Fantasy Flight Games announced that FFG had bought the L5R brand from AEG and will relaunch the card game as a LCG (non-collectible), with significant rules changes and a new design. The game is to go on hiatus following the release of Evil Portents, the final expansion from AEG, and will be relaunched at Gencon 2017.

With Xerxes' army temporarily delayed at Thermopylae, the Greek fleet, based at Artemisium, some 50 miles or so directly east of Thermopylae, took the opportunity to attempt to stop the Persians from extending this Line of Communications. In a battle that appears to have extended over two or three days, the Greeks managed to eke out a slim tactical win. However, when Thermopylae fell, Themistocles' position became untenable, and the Greek fleet retreated to anchorage in the narrow channel of the Bay of Eleusis, west of Athens, at Salamis.<br/><br/>With her naval flanks secured, the Persians rolled into lower Greece, capturing Athens and razing the town. However, to complete his subjugation of Greece, Xerxes had to destroy their fleet. To that end, the Persians sailed to a position south of Salamis.<br/><br/>At Artemisium the Greeks had learned that, while their crews and marines were superior, the huge disparity in numbers could be telling. Unless they could neutralize this Persian strength.<br/><br/>To that end, Themistocles lured the huge Persian fleet to attack the Greeks in the Bay of Eleusis, whose entrances were so restrictive as to negate any numerical superiority.<br/><br/>There were two entrances to the bay. To plug up the western escape hatch, Xerxes dispatched his crack Egyptian squadron. Upon hearing this, Adeimantus and his Corinthians peeled off from the main fleet and sailed to the western mouth to block any Egyptian attempt to gain entrance. This &quot;action&quot; appears to have been a stand off, with both sides &quot;blockading&quot; and not fighting.<br/><br/>At the eastern entrance, the Greeks deployed in three lines, along a narrow front of about 1800 yards, thus negating Persian numerical superiority. The Persians entered the bay in three long lines astern, which they then turned into nine lines abreast.<br/><br/>The result was a boarding battle, and this was where the Greeks shone. Despite having half the manpower per ship of the Persians, their weaponry, armor and land-based tactics were superior to that of the Persians. And that superiority resulted in a smashing Greek victory.<br/><br/>Xerxes retired to Thessaly, to try again the next year. The result was a great Greek victory, on land, at Plataea, followed by the Greek victory that completely cut Persian Lines of Communication, at Mycale.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition"], "average": "6.98214", "name": "Salamis", "playingtime": "360", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["War Galley"], "usersrated": "56", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Greece", "Great Battles of History"]}, "1896": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "The American Dream Game", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Stock Holding", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "1979", "usersrated": "49", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: USA"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic458771_t.jpg", "average": "6.29031", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Milton Bradley"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic458771.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Milton Bradley Edition 1979"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Negotiation"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "The object of this game is to be the first player to collect $1,000,000.<br/><br/>Players move around a board with opportunities to buy/sell stocks, patent inventions and copyright items, purchase insurance, and avoid traps.

The higher the rank, the higher the number.<br/>When they introduced Stratego in the USA, the numbering was reversed, so the Marshall was a 1, the General 2, and so on.  The 1st rank (most powerful) was 1, the second most powerful was 2, 3rd most powerful was 3....<br/>Then, in 2000s Hasbro re-imagined Stratego in the USA and made a few changes.  They reduced the number of pieces per side (from 40 to 30), added additional powers, and changed the numbering to reflect the European system.<br/>This caused extreme consternation with many faithful American Stratego fans who preferred the 'old way'.  (Actually the second oldest way, but whatever.)  Many of these insist on playing Stratego with the 'Marshall 1 system'.<br/>This wouldn't be a problem, except any and all discussions of Stratego are fraught with misunderstandings by those who are unaware of dual numbering systems!

The ore has to be transported initially by lorries and also later by barges to the coastal warehouse.  All transport has to be hired and there is always less transport available than required, favouring those who are prepared to take a risk on achieving a quick journey without mishap.  For example there are only 5 barges (always one less than the numbers of players) to encourage competition and load sharing.  You can also force other players to pay you for taking their ore to make up a barge load as all barges have to travel fully laden.  Much depends on how long a journey takes.

Kill everything you meet. Backstab your friends and steal their stuff. Grab the treasure and run.<br/><br/>Admit it. You love it.<br/><br/>This award-winning card game, designed by Steve Jackson, captures the essence of the dungeon experience... with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff. You and your friends compete to kill monsters and grab magic items. And what magic items! Don the Horny Helmet and the Boots of Butt-Kicking. Wield the Staff of Napalm... or maybe the Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment. Start by slaughtering the Potted Plant and the Drooling Slime, and work your way up to the Plutonium Dragon...<br/><br/>And it's illustrated by John Kovalic! Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin can reduce any roleplaying group to hysteria. And, while they're laughing, you can steal their stuff.<br/><br/><br/>Other<br/><br/>Part of the Munchkin series.<br/><br/>Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels.  Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.<br/><br/>In May 2010, Steve Jackson Games made the &quot;big announcement.&quot; Many rules and cards were changed. See The Great 2010 Munchkin Changeover for details. Of note to Munchkin fans, the Kneepads of Allure card, which had been removed in the 14th printing, was added back to the game but modified to be less powerful.<br/><br/><br/>Sequels:<br/><br/><br/>    The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin<br/>    Munchkin Apocalypse<br/>    Munchkin Axe Cop<br/>    Munchkin Bites!<br/>    Munchkin Booty<br/>    Munchkin Conan<br/>    Munchkin Cthulhu<br/>    Munchkin Fu<br/>    Munchkin Impossible<br/>    Munchkin Legends<br/>    Munchkin Pathfinder<br/>    Munchkin Zombies<br/>    Star Munchkin<br/>    Super Munchkin<br/><br/><br/><br/>Related Board Games<br/><br/><br/>    Munchkin Quest<br/><br/><br/><br/>Online play<br/><br/><br/>     Vassal does not support Munchkin anymore.

Famous battles can be re-fought and alliances can be made and broken with this compelling game of military and political strategy&quot;<br/><br/>Large playing board in three sections, four sets of army pieces in red, white, blue and light green, comprising 1 General, 9 infantry and 9 cavalry units.  Six sets of 4 town cards of different colors, 4 alliance cards, 2 dice, 6 page rule book, and a 4 page &quot;The Years of Napoleon&quot; historical booklet.<br/><br/>The game reproduces the Napoleonic wars at the strategic level in a very abstract fashion (all players are equal).  It can be won either by the outright defeat of your opponent, or (more likely) by acquiring towns controlling large areas of territory.  The board is an abstract representation of Europe and western Russia and is divided into six areas of roughly equal size representing France, Prussia, Russia, Austria, Italy and Spain.<br/><br/>Each country has four provincial towns, and five of the countries used as starting countries also have a capital city.  Parts of the board, particularly the central area, have areas of impenetrable mountains, forests, and sea which restrict the movement of the troops.<br/><br/>There are introductory and standard rules.  Normally, each player selects a country, but in the two player game each gets two countries except that the France + Prussia combo is not allowed.<br/><br/>The pieces move using the dice, and combat is deterministic.  The throw can be used all on one piece or many pieces.  The full throw does not have to be used.  The pieces are placed in a set format on the country selected, with the General on the capital square and four infanty and four cavalry. The town cards are used to keep track of who controls what.<br/><br/>The pieces move in set ways. The General moves one square in any direction. When it attacks it has a value of one and when defending a value of two. The General must be present to take a town.  Cavalry moves two squares at a time and must move horizontally or vertically but never diagonally.  Infantry moves one square and only diagonally.  Pieces cannot pass through opposing lines unless there is a clear gap of at least one square.<br/><br/>Combat is like movement: one considers which pieces could be moved to the target piece's square and totals up the combat value --if large enough, the opposing piece is removed.  Only one piece can be attacked in a turn.  In the standard game, adjacent pieces also support each other (in a manner reminiscent of Diplomacy), which introduces a fair amount of tactics in on-going battles.<br/><br/>Lost pieces are regenerated in your country's mustering area, forcing you to keep a constant flow of recruits towards the front.  In the standard game, the towns also represent logistical support --lose the town and you lose the corresponding piece.<br/><br/>The odd movement system means you actually have two sets of cavalry and infantry pieces on the board, each set (which we could call &quot;odd&quot; and &quot;even&quot;) being unable to assist the other.<br/><br/>A capital can only be captured after the provincial towns have been captured.  Where more than two players are playing you can agree to ally with another player and exchange alliance cards as reminders.  An ally cannot cross into his ally's territory without his consent.  Alliances can be broken simply by announcing the fact; you can attack your former ally on your next turn only, giving him a turn to re-deploy.<br/><br/>The game is won if the player captures all his opponents capitals or captures 8 towns of any colour but not including the 4 in his own country.  You also win if your opponent's General is left with no troops.<br/><br/>Campaign is basically a pure strategy game.  It you are in a position to attack a piece, you will take it.  However, there is some luck depending on how high a movement throw you have.<br/><br/>from the Waddington ad for the game from 1976:   &quot;This absorbing strategy game captures the tension and the pressures of the famous Napoleonc battles.

In the Mertwig's Maze game, you are the would-be heir to Mertwig's throne!  Can you complete your quest, get past the Mystic Musk Ox in Mertwig's Maze, and reach the finish before the other players?  More importantly, can you claim the throne before Mertwig passes on and the kingdom falls into the clutches of evil?<br/><br/>The Mertwig's Maze game contains a large game map, eight smaller maps, full-color counters, and hundreds of cards depicting hirelings, magical items, arms and armor, and random events to aid your quest - or hinder your opponents'!  Mertwig's Maze game can be played by two or more players, and is recommended for ages 10 and up.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["TSR Folio game"], "age": "10", "name": "Mertwig's Maze", "playingtime": "100", "boardgamemechanic": ["Modular Board", "Role Playing"], "average": "6.43612", "usersrated": "245", "boardgamefamily": ["Dungeons & Dragons"]}, "1966": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic67137.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Richard Garfield"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1998", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": ["Phil Foglio"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Wizards of the Coast"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic67137_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Racing", "Science Fiction"], "description": "The Radioactive expansion to the award-winning RoboRally board game features formidable hazards for players programming Twonky and the other robots.
