The game's art style will be heavily influenced by the silver age of comic books, such as the work by Jack Kirby, as well as by the more recent comic creator Bruce Timm. The designs for the enemy alien characters are heavily influenced by the works of H. P.

If you paint walls, you can swim up on walls in this manner; though painting walls won't count towards victory. Moving in your enemy's colour makes you slower and will do slight damage.<br/><br/>Getting hit by the enemy repeated times will cause you do splat into the enemy's colour, and you'll have a several seconds wait until your respawn at your team's starting point. It's possible to send yourself flying to a team-mate's location.<br/><br/>Together with the typical twin-stick FPS control scheme, the Gamepad's gyro is used to complement the right stick's control in which direction the player is looking; a system that is very effective for precise aiming.<br/><br/>The game also has a 2-player mode where two players run around on a stage trying to shoot balloons, and a single player mode where the player needs to clear stages of enemies and find secrets.<br/><br/>"}, "161016": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Incubo dal profondo", "rpgdesigner": ["Giampaolo Rai"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Sine Requie"], "usersrated": "0", "rpggenre": ["Horror"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "average": "0", "description": "From the blurb (translated):<br/><br/>Strange happenings on an oil platform in the North Sea arouse suspicions in the minister of industry, who sends a representative to investigate before production stops altogether.<br/><br/>"}, "161017": {"poll": [], "name": "Super Mario Maker", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["eShop Wii U Downloadable edition", "North American Wii U edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2976165.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Cute Fantasy"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "usersrated": "22", "videogamedeveloper": ["Nintendo Co., Ltd."], "videogamefranchise": ["Better Description Needed", "Super Mario"], "videogameplatform": ["Wii U"], "videogamehonor": ["2014 Game Critics Best Social/Casual/Puzzle Game of the Year Winner", "2015 CVA Best International Game of the Year Nominee", "2015 Game Critics Best Console Game of the Year Nominee", "2015 Game Critics Best Social/Casual/Puzzle Game of the Year Winner", "2015 Gamescom Best Family Game of the Year Nominee", "2015 Gamescom Best Nintendo Console Game of the Year Winner", "2015 Gamescom Best Social/Casual/Online Game of the Year Winner", "2015 Global Game Awards Best Platformer Game of the Year Winner", "2015 Golden Geek Best Wii U Game Nominee", "2015 Golden Geek Best Wii U Game Winner", "2015 Golden Geek Most Innovative Video Game Nominee", "2015 Golden Geek Most Innovative Video Game Winner", "2015 Golden Geek Video Game of the Year Nominee", "2015 The Game Awards Best Family Game of the Year Winner", "2015 The Game Awards Game of the Year Nominee", "2016 British Academy Game Awards Best Family/Children's Game of the Year Nominee", "2016 D.I.C.E.

It is the tenth main game in the Mario Party series, the fourteenth overall, and the first game in the series for Wii U.<br/><br/>Mario Party 10 continues the tradition of the Mario Party series, in which four players, controlled by either human or CPU, compete against each other on a game board by participating in various minigames. At least one board will feature the same play style introduced in Mario Party 9, in which all four players travel across the board together. Along with the standard competitive modes, Mario Party 10 introduces a new mode called Bowser Party, in which a fifth player controls Bowser using the Wii U GamePad. In this mode, the four main players are tasked with reaching the end of the board without losing all of their hearts whilst avoiding being caught by Bowser, who is trying to stop them. If Bowser catches up to the other players, a minigame takes place in which Bowser uses the GamePad's features to activate various devices, such as tilt controlled fire rods, pinball flippers, and a spinning wheel, whilst the other players attempt to take as little damage as possible. The players win if at least one player makes it to the end of the board with their hearts intact, but if all players are defeated, Bowser wins.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Mario Party 10&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "161020": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Johan's Lost Vault", "rpgdesigner": ["Frank Schmidt"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2204361.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Filbar"], "rpgproducer": ["Frank Schmidt"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["AD&D First Edition (1e) Compatible Products", "AD&D Second Edition (2e) Compatible Products"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "average": "0", "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Adventures in Filbar"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2204361_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>At one time the City of Tygos was a bustling metropolis located in the southeastern portion of the Plains of Dorack.

The resulting response of the Plainsmen was devastating to Tygos and the city was levelled for the most part and the water supply was poisoned. The city was also home to a group of adventurers called JOHAN and their fortress was said to contain powerful ancient magic that was never recovered.

The lean, quick babau are the assassins of the underworld, born of serial murderers, and so inherently wretched that their skin constantly weeps an acidic ichor that covers their entire body. The hulking hezrou, by comparison, is a powerful abyssal heavyweight that corrupts and warps everything it touches, and pollutes the very world around it. Many fear and revile these loathsome creatures, and rightfully so, but they are nothing when compared to the mythic paragons of their species.<br/><br/>This book presents game statistics for mythic babau and mythic hezrou, both of which have unique abilities never seen elsewhere. Mythic babau are expert assassins who not only excel at making powerful, deadly sneak attacks, even when others would not be able to, but also are invigorated by making a bloody kill, and gain the ability to spit blobs of clinging acid at their foes from afar. Mythic hezrou, by contrast, can cause bodies to twist, warp, and putrefy with a single touch, can surround themselves with a deadly miasma of toxic gases to punish those who would dare approach them, and can even corrupt entire landscapes in a 10-mile radius with their mere presence. In addition to these game statistics, the book also introduces rules for performing special rituals that can be enacted by players of any class in order to summon mythic babau and mythic hezrou, with both specific game rules for doing so and detailed flavorful descriptions.<br/><br/>"}, "161034": {"rpgdesigner": ["Mark A.

Stipulate her with &quot;at finding dead cats.&quot; Earn points for coming up with the best and funniest stipulations to beat your friends in the game while stifling their superpowers, crushing their careers, limiting their lifetime supplies, and destroying their dreams.<br/><br/>Stipulations begins when a player draws a Stipulations card as well as a bonus card and chooses to announce the superpower, occupation, lifetime supply, or fulfilled dream. As soon as the announcement is made, each of the other players has 90 seconds to think up and write down a stipulation, or any condition that makes the announcement worse. For example, if a player announces that they have wings, one player might write &quot;but can't fly&quot;, whereas another player might write &quot;with a 50 foot wingspan that can never be retracted.&quot; All players hand their written stipulations to the player sitting next to the announcer who reads them aloud. The announcer selects which of the written stipulations is the worst (whichever they would want the least) and the player who wrote it collects the stipulations card to keep track of score. The announcer also reveals the bonus point category (Funniest, Most original, etc.) and awards the bonus card to whomever they deem worthy of it based on the written stipulations.

Once this phase is complete, the chosen cards of each spell type are then shuffled together and placed on the board in the appropriately labeled spots. Staged face-up, the cards are drafted one at a time from the board as each player builds their own customized deck of spells. Once deck building is complete, the game board is flipped over to the dueling ground side and players engage in a spell casting fight to determine the winner.

The Recommended Variant is the 3 player free-for-all game which is the basic setup of the game's gameplay. The game can be played 1 versus 1 which will still use the play mat and will still use the unit positioning area such as the left/right flank unit placement.<br/><br/>Game Objective: Reduce all opponents&rsquo; Leader life Points to zero.<br/><br/>Game Setup:<br/><br/>1. Select Race Players choose which race they wish to play and thoroughly shuffle their decks. Pass each deck counter-clockwise to next player for reshuffling until it goes back to the designated player.<br/><br/>2. Place Leader Card Each player must place their leader Card in the field (playmat designated area). A Leader Card starts with 30 Health Points. (If a leader&rsquo;s life points drops to zero, that player is eliminated from the game).<br/><br/>3. Determine Play Order    Randomly select which player will go first. After the first player&rsquo;s turn, player turn order will resume in a counter-clockwise direction.<br/><br/>4. Draw Hand Cards    All players must draw 6 cards from their chosen deck. Every play turn, players can draw 2 cards in their library. All players can assign up to 2 cards on the mining placement area which will produce 1 gold per card per turn. The more cards assigned to the mining area, the more gold it produces. However, re-assigning the cards/using the cards from the mining area has an additional cost of 4 gold. It is the penalty for the cards being re-assigned as unit in the field.<br/><br/>5. First Turn    The first player begins their turn and performs the actions described in the Play Sequence section of these rules.<br/><br/>Game Play Sequence:<br/><br/>These are all the actions a player may perform during their turn. Each action must be completed in the order designated below. In a free-for-all game, the player chosen to go first takes their turn. Next, in a consecutive order (going in a counter-clockwise direction), the other players will fulfill their turns.<br/><br/>1.    Re-draw (Optional) A player can elect to declare a Re-Draw action at the start of their turn. This action is performed in place of any of the regular actions associated with a typical turn. When a player has no useful cards in their hand, they can choose to use the Re-draw action. The Re-Draw action allows a player to discard their hand of cards and draw 6 new cards from their deck. This action ends their turn. The player is not allowed to take any more actions, and will not be able to produce any Gold until their next turn. Note: If you don&rsquo;t need to Re-Draw, skip this action and take a normal turn. Simply begin your turn with the collect Gold action and precede through the subsequent action steps until you wrap up your turn with the Upkeep action.<br/><br/>2.    Collect Gold Collect the amount of Gold equal to the total Gold on all of the cards placed on the mining area.<br/><br/>3.    Draw Card Draw 2 cards from your Race deck.<br/><br/>4.    Activate Cards This action lets you establish and activate any type of cards, use    Command cards, and/or assign new units.    During this play sequence, a player may perform all four of these options: - Play 2 Card to the mining field. Note: All cards in the mining field should be placed facedown. - Play any number of Passive and Instant Command Cards.    - Play any unit cards to assign any number of new units on the left/right flank.<br/><br/>5.    Re-assign Once the unit is re-assigned from mining area to any of the field flank, it cannot go back to the mining area. However, once a unit is assigned to any flank, you can re-assign it the other flank with a cost of 2 gold.<br/><br/>For further information of the game's &quot;How to play&quot;, please download the game's Rule Book.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["The Beginning"], "age": "12", "name": "Blood Oath: The Beginning", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Deck / Pool Building"], "average": "7", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "161138": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2062234.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ludovic Barbe", "Bruno Cathala"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Vincent Dutrait"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Blue Orange (EU)", "Blue Orange Games"], "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2062234_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Fantasy"], "description": "In Dragon Run, the players have just raided a dragon's keep, picked up a bunch of loot, and awakened the dragon. Now it's time to flee, ideally making it out with both our treasures and our lives.<br/><br/>On each turn, a player can either advance boldly, flee cautiously, or cry like a baby. If you advance boldly, you draw a card from the location deck, which holds three types of cards: one that allows that player to either redraw or stop, one that grants new treasure from the treasure hall, and (of course) the dragon. If you draw the dragon, you lose one health point (out of two), the dragon calms down (i.e., it loses one temper point), and the location deck is reshuffled. If you're injured twice, you die and are out of the game.<br/><br/>When fleeing cautiously, you first discard a treasure worth at least one coin, then roll a d10. If your roll is higher than the number of cards in the location deck, the dragon calms down, then you reshuffle the location deck; otherwise you must draw a card from the location deck just as when someone advances boldly. Your sacrificed treasure is still lost.<br/><br/>When you cry like a baby, you don't draw a location card, instead discarding a treasure worth at least two coins. Having shown your obeisance to the dragon, the turn passes to the next player.<br/><br/>Players start with four treasure cards; while some cards are worth 1-5 coins, others provide a one-shot potion or a talisman that stays in effect until the location deck is shuffled, which ends the round. Gameplay lasts from 5 to 8 rounds. Each player has a unique power that can be used once per round: the thief can steal cards from opponents, the cleric can heal opponents in exchange for treasure, etc. If the dragon loses its final temper point, the game ends and whoever holds the most valuable treasure wins; if all of the adventurers are charred to death first, then the dragon wins instead!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "French first edition"], "average": "6.19675", "name": "Dragon Run", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": ["Press Your Luck", "Take That", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "246", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Dragons"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Essen 2014 - Blue Orange", "The Game Pit: Episode 35 - Essen Brief with Nathan"]}, "161139": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Hamish Sterling"], "poll": [], "name": "Pocket Rugby League", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Rugby"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2054571_t.jpg", "average": "6.375", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Pocket Sports"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2054571.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "Second edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Sports"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Pocket Rugby League is head smashing, scrum packing, ball and all Rugby - played with dice.<br/> We've made this game to give plenty of scoring chances...in fact, not scoring in an attacking raid might be more painful than the huge hits throughout the game.<br/> The gameplay focuses on each side taking turns in an attacking set of 6 tackles.<br/> You are in control of 5 playing positions - the scrum half always starts each passage of play.

Doing so allows you to expend resources in order to add buildings, statuary, bill boards, and groups throughout the city. These installations expand your influence, giving you control of city sectors.<br/><br/>The first player to control a predetermined number of city sectors wins the game.<br/><br/>ENACTING AGENDA<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player selects a faction-oriented Agenda Card to put into play. This is called enacting an agenda.<br/><br/>Agenda Cards list five different types of Missions your agents must complete. Once they have completed three or more different missions from the list, the agenda is considered realized, and you are awarded a specified number of Influence Points. These points can then be spent on placing installations on the game board.<br/><br/>COMPLETING MISSIONS<br/><br/>Mission Cards list five different types of Actions our agents must complete while in neutral- or enemy-controlled locations. Once three or more different actions from the list are completed, the mission is completed. You gain the listed benefits from the mission, and the Mission Card is then placed face-up under the Agenda Card (for scorekeeping purposes).<br/><br/>COMPLETING ACTIONS<br/><br/>Each agent in the game has a primary function; such as: eliminating, seducing, capturing, corrupting, or turning enemy agents. To perform its function, an agent must be in a city sector, or sector location, that contains a keyword matching the same keyword on the agent's card.<br/><br/>CyberPsi utilizes polyhedron. An action attempt may require you to roll 1d4 or 1d12 to determine how many Action Points an agent musters when attempting the action. Asset Cards that are equipped to the agent sometimes adds to an action attempt's Action Point total.<br/><br/>Thus, a Rank 1 Hacker in a location with the keyword INTERFACE may try to &quot;Steal (1) Data Card from target enemy Database.&quot; The Action Point Value needed to successfully perform this action is (12). In order to be able to reach this, you roll 1d8 (as indicated on his card) and add (2) Action Points provided by his &quot;Jac-in-Boxx&quot; Asset Card and (1d4) Action Points provided by his &quot;Virtualization Headgear&quot; Asset Card. The total number of Action Points your Hacker gets is (13), which exceeds the target value of (12). Thus, the action attempt is successful, and your agents enables you to take anyone Data Card from the target player's Database.<br/><br/>RESOURCES<br/><br/>During the course of the game, you will assign agents to undertake activities that generate resources. You can then expend these resources to put other agents into play, to buy Asset Cards, and to unlock cards that can be placed into your draw deck.<br/><br/>COMBAT<br/><br/>Combat in CyberPsi is resolved by rolling each combatant's die type (d4, d6, d8, etc), adding any modifiers provided by Asset Cards, and comparing the results to each other. Damage is determined and applied, and the battle continues or ends, depending on combat situational factors.<br/><br/>Some agents have Combat Abilities that impact attack order, targeting, and damage.<br/><br/>"}, "161144": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Birgit H\u00e4hnle"], "poll": [], "name": "Biberburgen", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Modular Board", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Beavers"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Heros"], "boardgameversion": ["German first edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Children's Game", "Dice"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "The Beavers have to build lodges and collect winter stores, but always have to expect flooding and interference by other beavers from the neighboring areas.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a pair of beavers and a set of trees in different colors.

But while vampires in novels, movies, and television each provide their own unique twist or spin on the vampire myth, creating innumerable different interpretations of what it means to be a vampire, for the Pathfinder roleplaying game, at least, there is only one kind of vampire, which fits some styles of vampirism well, and doesn&rsquo;t fit others at all. Even worse for vampire enthusiasts, the ability to actually play as one of these nocturnal lurkers is incredibly limited.<br/><br/>At least, that was the case until Necromancers of the Northwest changed all that with Liber Vampyr: Secrets of the Blood, a book devoted to making vampiric player characters not only possible, but fully supported. It made use of a new system, called cruomancy, which allowed characters to gain blood points by drinking blood, and to spend those blood points to power various abilities, gained from feats and class features. The book was built in a way that allowed players to pick and choose not just their vampiric powers and abilities, but even their weaknesses, encouraging players to build their own monster to match their vision of vampirism.<br/><br/>Scions of the Vampire: Blood, Shadow, and Smoke picks up where Liber Vampyr left off, by providing 50 new feats and three new prestige classes, as well as several groups of supplemental rules that cover some of the additional concerns of vampirism. The book introduces three vampiric lineages, or bloodlines, each with special powers. Gain power from darkness and make shadows do your bidding as a Shaedross scion, align yourself with the Borsiviaks in order to gain an eldritch mastery over blood, bending and twisting it at your whim, or delve deep into the power of the Montavix to transform into a misty vapor, rendering you all but immune to attack.

Players take on the roles of intrepid explorers traversing the globe in search of ancient artifacts while trying to outwit and outrun enemy agents.<br/><br/>The game begins with the players choosing a mythical artifact, which will serve as the McGuffin for the game. Each artifact will have a series of clues that are distributed around the world.<br/>Clues take several forms: They can be excavation sites, scraps of historical documents, ancient relics, or even people who may be able to help the players deduce the location of the artifact. Each clue that is collected brings the players on step closer to discovering the artifact&rsquo;s final resting place. Players will have to act fast as enemy agents (controlled by the game) will be hot on their heels collecting clues and setting ambushes at every turn!<br/><br/>Combat in EotE takes the form of action sequences, or confrontations with the enemy villain that happen periodically throughout the game. Players work together to defeat enemy minions by using their weapons, special abilities, teamwork, and most importantly, the environment around them. Furniture such as crates, explosive barrels, tables, and even bottles of whiskey can be used and manipulated by the players to give them the upper hand in any battle. Find yourself staring down the barrel of a Tommy Gun? Flip over the nearest table for cover! Cornered by a band of hired muscle? Grab the nearest whiskey bottle, set it alight, and toss it at an explosive crate to create the perfect getaway!<br/><br/>To the Ends of the Earth is the board game where you, the players, truly determine the course of your adventure! Fight vigilantly to defeat the enemy villain, recover the artifact, and win the game!<br/><br/>EotE features a unique Action Dice allocation system to determine the options available to each player during their turn. Each player will choose an adventurer to control for the duration of the game. Each adventurer has three &quot;stats&quot;, which determine their proficiency for different tasks:<br/><br/>Brawn determines a character&rsquo;s Strength, Speed, and Endurance, and is used for physical tasks such as brawling, climbing, or using melee weapons.<br/><br/>Skill describes a character&rsquo;s Dexterity, Coordination, and Awareness. Using firearms, disarming traps, and driving vehicles are made much easier with a high Skill Stat.<br/><br/>Wits relates to a character&rsquo;s Intelligence, Problem-Solving, and Inter-Personal skills. A high Wits Stat is needed to conduct research, excavate dig sites, or issue commands to allies and other characters.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each turn, a player will roll their available Action Dice (five six-sided dice if their character is healthy). Each die rolled below a Stat may be used for an action that requires that Stat.<br/><br/>Actions include movement, researching artifacts, brawling with enemies, using firearms, or manipulating the environment. Special abilities and equipment broaden the choices available to each player, and with so much potential to strategize, there is never a &lsquo;bad roll&rsquo;. Every action you take will have consequences that ripple through the rest of the game, creating a unique adventure each time you play!<br/><br/>"}, "161221": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Oliver Stuhr"], "poll": [], "name": "Das Feuerrote Teufelchen", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement"], "yearpublished": "1983", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Spiel"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Edition Perlhuhn (G\u00f6ttinger Spiele)"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Das Feuerrote Teufelchen (The Fire-Red Devil) is an abstract chase designed for Spiel sets.<br/><br/>The &quot;devil&quot; player attempts to overtake the &quot;angel&quot; player, while the angel aims to keep moving until the cubes run out.

To face these challenges, you must put on your foreman clothes. Between hiring workers, managing their organization, purchasing slaves or tools, and taking out loans, you'll have to make the right decisions to fulfill your dream: Becoming the greatest builder the age has ever known.<br/><br/>In the game, players score points (and gain money) by completing the construction of buildings. Each building has four characteristics &mdash; carpentry, masonry, architecture, painting &mdash; rated between 0 and 5, and the workers have the same characteristics valued in the same range. To complete a construction, the player must add enough workers to cover the four characteristics of the building, but placing a worker on a construction site costs money.<br/><br/>Each turn players have three free actions; however, for an added cost players may also chose to buy additional actions during their turn. Unlike in The Builders: Middle Ages, players can acquire slaves and put them to work, but if they don't pay to free the slaves by the end of the game, they lose points. Other changes from the original game include the ability to send your workers to universities or purchase tools to improve their characteristics.<br/><br/>Make use of your workers, of your slaves, or your freed slaves to build your buildings and amass victory points to ultimately be named the greatest builder of all!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "French first edition", "German first edition", "Hungarian First Edition", "Polish first edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "name": "The Builders: Antiquity", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Card Drafting", "Set Collection"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "583", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "average": "6.90773", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Boardcast News 4.30.15 | Podcast of Nonsensical Gamers", "DJ63: Los Constructores: Edad Media (2013) Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Henry", "HLG 4: Sabotage"]}, "161227": {"poll": [], "name": "Warzone: The Brotherhood Cathedral", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "1998", "boardgameexpansion": ["Warzone (first edition)"], "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Mutant Chronicles", "Warzone"], "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2433190_t.jpg", "average": "5.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Heartbreaker", "Target Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2433190.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Miniatures", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>The Cathedrals of the Brotherhood stand as citadels of faith before the overwhelming tide of the Dark Legion.

In Dreams of the Old Ones, the supernatural has burst forth from the shadows and taken center stage across the globe. Civilization as we know it in the 21st Century has all but collapsed, and the Magi, once hidden from humanity, have begun to pursue their agendas openly, no longer concerned with keeping their fellow humans in the dark about the truth.<br/><br/>Dreams of the Old Ones examines how these various changes have reshaped the Earth socially, politically and physically. The rules and materials herein are designed to explore a dark, broken nightmare of a world, far removed from the &ldquo;world outside your window&rdquo; presented in the core rulebook. This post-apocalyptic dystopia is painted in broad strokes, leaving many of the specific details up to the Guide to determine. New setting elements and systems will be introduced which have been designed with the shattered world of Dreams of the Old Ones in mind. Having said that, some Guides may wish to cherry pick certain elements from this book for use in a standard Glimpse the Beyond campaign, while ignoring other elements. Such is the prerogative of the individual Guide. It&rsquo;s your game. Keep what you like and discard the rest.<br/><br/>Dreams of the Old Ones includes:<br/><br/>     Alternate Character Creation Rules: an expanded rule set that allows players to draw up mundane humans, humans who have been mutated by chaotic magickal energies and supernatural creatures as playable characters.<br/>     New Flaws and Skills: flaws and skills specifically designed for use in the Dreams of the Old Ones setting.<br/>     Alternate Ritual Magick Rules: the Dreams of the Old Ones setting is a magick-rich, chaotic environment. As such, Ritual Magick works a bit differently than in the core setting. <br/>     Locations: a brief overview of the city of Chicago and the village of Moundsville, as they are in the post-apocalyptic world of Dreams of the Old Ones.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "161230": {"rpgdesigner": ["Damian Jankowski"], "rpg": ["Dungeon World"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Damned: A Dungeon World Playbook", "rpgartist": ["Damian Jankowski"], "rpgproducer": ["Damian Jankowski"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["SemiDark Arts"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>&quot;Why do you forsake me, Lord?!&quot;<br/><br/>Fallen on your knees, you plead with your God to accept you once again.

MIND can be played solo or in two players, but also with up to four players with the help of an extra copy. The goal is to build your colony and complete the set of five achievements required by the game before the last turn ends and players can do this by cooperating or competing one with each other.<br/><br/>Players build new sectors, train new citizens and manage their command to do as many actions as they can to maximize production of credits, influence, equipment or overpower while also progressing. The game requires lots of planning since there are many things that can intervene and ruin your game plan if not paying attention. Players interact and can either help or sabotage each other. Units can be sent to start fires, break structures, close doors, start an epidemic or even unpower structures. To resolve all these players need to assign command to their units and use them to repair, build or interact with different things from the colony. Players can improve their units by equipping them with items or assigning them influence thus enabling them access to the faction's unique super power.<br/><br/>MIND is a game that benefits from many more play through as strategies develop better once the rules have been understood and mastered. The game initial setup and events that happen during the session are given by scenario sheets and these also contribute to the asymmetry of the game as one faction may have to face a fire outbreak while the enemy may start with invaders.<br/><br/>If you like strategy games, games that can be played solo, games that have confrontation or simply that let you cooperate with a friend while facing a great challenge then MIND may be the perfect game for you.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.8", "name": "MIND: The Fall of Paradise", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Area Control / Area Influence", "Area Movement", "Card Drafting", "Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management"], "age": "9", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The First Roll - What's New on Kickstarter? - Episode 70: Thursday, September 29th"]}, "161278": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Stephen Stagliano"], "poll": [], "name": "Spiritual Warfare", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Deck / Pool Building", "Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2055872_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["The Game Crafter, LLC", "Stesso Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2055872.png", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Fantasy", "Mature / Adult"], "age": "13", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Spiritual Warfare is everything you want in a game!

In this game you play the role of one of the crew members on board the space ship Liberty. Your job as a Mover is to jump from planet to planet in the system picking up and delivering cargo. Movers specialize in getting cargo to its destination as efficiently as possible. As you deliver cargo, you are rewarded with resources that are needed to keep the Liberty flying. But you must do this without drawing too much attention from the Universal Oversight.<br/><br/>Universal Oversight (UO) is the government elected by the planets to police the system. The UO watches all movement through the system in an attempt to keep order. Over time it has become corrupt and evil. UO Scouts are sometimes dispatched to chase down and interrogate Movers that have been spotted delivering cargo. They are looking to confiscate anything that might be a threat to the UO&rsquo;s power. If you draw the eye of the UO too often, your job will eventually become impossible. You and your fellow players must work together to deliver cargo, avoid UO Scouts and quickly handle any Events that pop up along the way.<br/><br/>To win the game, you need to complete a set of five Objective Cards. These cards directly continue the story that begins in the included graphic novel Finding Liberty. (A 20-card random objective card deck will also be included with the game. Players can choose 5 cards from this deck for a fresh experience each game)<br/><br/>- Unique Dice-Rolling Mechanic<br/>How the dice are rolled-Space Movers handles dice-rolling to complete skill checks in a whole new way. Rolls take place inside the game box on a specially designed roll board. Dice are rolled one at a time instead of all at once. For each skill needed in the check, 1 die will be rolled needing a 5 or higher for success. Since the dice are rolled 1 at a time into the box, players are encouraged to strike dice already rolled in an attempt to change the result as needed. After all the dice are rolled, one last roll is made using the blank 6 sided die. This signals the end of the skill check and is a player&rsquo;s last attempt to change any previous die results.<br/><br/>- Comic Book Included<br/>The story begins in the Comic book &ldquo;Finding Liberty&rdquo; that will be included with the game.

The opponent then moves his player marker to the ball and selects what card he will use to hit the ball back. This continues until one player manages to place a fourth card in a particular hitting zone, or a player is unable to return the ball.<br/><br/>Play continues until one player has won the set, i.e. six games.<br/><br/>Hit It! has abstracted tennis into a quick tactical card game, but retains the feel of the sport.<br/><br/>"}, "161336": {"boardgamedesigner": ["David Hamrick"], "poll": [], "name": "Jungle Heart", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Press Your Luck", "Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamefamily": ["4X games", "Admin: Unreleased Games"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Wine Key Games"], "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Dice", "Exploration"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "The long, lost island of Jungle Heart has just been discovered.

Play consists of investing In various companies, and receiving from the &quot;INVESTO&quot; Bank, Dividends and Bonuses in accordance with Instructions on a number of cards drawn by the players in rotation. Companies become bankrupt by the drawing of one of the Bankrupt cards.<br/><br/>TO BEGIN. One of the players is selected as Banker, and issues each of the players with &pound;1,000 with which to make his or her investments; retaining the balance of the money as the &quot;INVESTO&quot; Bank. (The Banker is entitled to join in the game, and should also receive the initial &pound;1,000.) The cards are then shuffled and placed face downwards in the centre of the table. The cards representing the ten companies are shuffled separately and placed face downwards beside the Banker, who is at all times in charge of the game. A number of company cards are then turned face upwards, in front of the Banker; the number so faced being one less than the number of players. (e.g. If five people are playing, then four company cards are turned up.) Players now invest in one or more of the companies as desired. All investments must be in multiples of &pound;100. The Banker keeps a record of all investments.<br/> THE PLAY. The first player (determined by any method desired) then draws the top card and places it face up in front of him. Each card has a number of the top representing one of the companies. If the player drawing the card has invested in that company, he announces the dividend (e.g. No. 4 &mdash;30% or 6/- in the &pound;). The Banker thereupon pays ALL players who have invested in No. 4 company, 30% of their investment, from the money in the Bank. Should the player not have invested in the company whose card is drawn, the play passes to the person next on his left, and so on round the table; each player announcing the dividend or bonus to be paid. ONLY If he has money invested in the company.<br/><br/>BANKRUPTCY. On a player drawing a &quot;BANKRUPT&quot; card for the company in which he has invested, he announces &quot;No. 7 &mdash;Bankrupt&quot;, and then reads the directions as to payment to or from the Bank (e.g. &quot;Shareholders must pay in 10/- for every &pound; invested, to meet the liabilities of the Company.&quot;) or &quot;Shareholders receive 5/- for every &pound; invested in the Company, from the sale of assets,&quot; as the case may be. The Banker then collects the money from, or pays the money to, the shareholders in accordance with the instructions. After all the players have paid or received their money, the Banker removes the bankrupt company from play and exposes the next company card. Any player who had invested in the company that was just bankrupt now has the opportunity to invest in the new company. There is no compulsion, and a player who has money invested in another company may elect not to invest in the new company. On oil investments being completed and recorded by the Banker, play continues with the next player.<br/><br/>CHANGE OF INVESTMENT. Changes in investments can only be made when all the cards have been drown. All changes must be recorded by the banker who makes a charge of 10% on the total investment for the issue of the new &quot;Script&quot;. (e.g. a player increases his investment as one of the companies from &pound;200 to &pound;500. The Banker charges &pound;50.). <br/>GENERAL. After all the cards have been drawn, they are re-shuffled, placed face down, and commeacing with the player on the left of the person who drew the last card, play re-commences. When a company is bankrupt and there are no more companies to be exposed, the players who had invested in the last company to go bankrupt may choose any ONE of the remaining companies in which to invest. The game is cancluded when the last company is bankrupt. The winner is the player who finishes the game with the most money.<br/><br/>"}, "161479": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Hutzli-Putz  Die Reise ins Abenteuer", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2061361_t.png", "boardgameartist": ["Katrin H\u00f6ngesberg"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Verlag Schmidt Zwiebelt\u00fcrme"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2061361.png", "boardgameversion": ["Schmidt Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Fantasy", "Racing"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Objective: be the first reaching space 135<br/> - moving by turns -<br/>Each player moves forward according die roll; ending on a red marked space follow instructions glued into the lid.<br/>note:<br/>Likely published during 1950s<br/><br/>"}, "161482": {"poll": [], "name": "Heileen", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows/Linux/Mac 3 in 1 Downloadable Edition"], "average": "3", "videogametheme": ["Moral Choices", "Romance / Relationships"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Winter Wolves"], "videogamegenre": ["Visual Novel"], "videogameplatform": ["Linux", "Macintosh", "Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Winter Wolves"], "description": "Heileen, cute 18 years old English girl.<br/><br/>She has a quiet life, without any real problems.

The update version for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 was released on June 3, 2014, with the full retail versions to follow on August 5. The PC versions (both digital and retail) are set for release on August 8, the PC port being delayed to get the console versions ready in time for the 2014 Evolution Championship Series.

It has been revealed that, despite some of the new characters having been recently featured in X Tekken, their gameplay mechanics are substantially different in order to match the game's pace. The game also adds a feature called &quot;Edition Select&quot; which, similarly to Hyper Street Fighter II, allows players to select different versions of characters, based on their properties in past Street Fighter IV iterations. Also, the update adds a &quot;Double Ultra&quot; option, which makes both of the character's Ultra Combos available simultaneously, at the cost of them doing reduced damage.<br/><br/>Alongside the usual balance changes, the update introduces some new fighting mechanics. The first is a new move called Red Focus, similar to the regular Focus move, but having more invincibility hits.
