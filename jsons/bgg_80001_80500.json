The game is published by Electronic Arts and was released on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. This is also a sequel to The Godfather: The Game, which was also developed and published by EA in 2006. The game was released on April 7, 2009 in North America, April 9 in Europe and April 5 in Australia. The Godfather II is played from a third person perspective. It also contains some strategy elements, as the player's character battles rival families and take over businesses to ultimately become a &quot;don&quot; ruling over many cities.<br/><br/>The Godfather II takes place in the late 1950s and early 1960s over three cities: Havana, Cuba, New York City, and Miami, Florida. Michael Corleone orders the player character, Dominic, to take charge of the family after the death of his boss and New York Don Aldo Trapani, the protagonist and player character of The Godfather: The Game. Now as Dominic, the player leads the family to defeat rival international families and take control of various businesses and crime rings, in order to become the most powerful Don in America and Cuba.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, The Godfather II (video game) , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80002": {"poll": [], "name": "Paradroid", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["UK C64 edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1085801.png", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "18", "videogamedeveloper": ["Graftgold"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade"], "videogameplatform": ["Commodore 64"], "videogamehonor": ["1985 Golden Joystick Best Original Game of the Year Nominee"], "average": "8.05556", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Hewson Consultants"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1085801_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>In Paradroid the player takes control of a small robot with the serial number 001.

The armouchi are a race of primatives, but that does not mean they cannot find a home among the civilized folk. Their origin is not entirely known. Some say they are the result of all the humanoid and monstrous humanoid races interbreeding. Others say the gods made them from whatever was left over after making all the &quot;better&quot; races.

The game of Commonwealth, however, immerses players into a universe where that war has already happened. In a galaxy not so far away from our own, the victor of this old war has endured for centuries after the last of their adversaries were completely extinguished. After some time though, the very heart of their species began to rot with the knowledge of their forefathers and the annihilation they had wreaked upon their galaxy. In penance, the children of the last race searched the stars endlessly for some form of redemption and reprieve from their ageless guilt. And the day soon came when they found it. In the form of a small galaxy outside their own, they discovered several infant races untouched by hyperspace travel, and untouched by war. The Ancients came to our galaxy and swore they would protect its inhabitants from the same fate that befell their own. And so they introduced peace and order to the Milky Way, for only the Commonwealth could unite all the galaxy's races and prevent them from descending into the endless abyss of battle. If you remember, this is not a story about a great war. This is a story determining how the next age of our galaxy will unfold. Will you protect the Commonwealth and quell all rebellion, or will you dissent and usher in the next age of empire dominance?<br/><br/>Welcome to the Commonwealth universe where three to six players clash economically, politically, militarily, and even covertly in an epic conflict that rides upon the ground-breaking game mechanic of simultaneous turns. By choosing one of twelve unique alien races, you will create customizable fleets, explore the galaxy coordinate by coordinate, acquire powerful technologies, and launch secret covert attacks that even your enemies (or friends) can't originate. For the more politically inclined players, the in-game government provides a dynamic experience that will test your mettle as you try orchestrate a series of legislative masterstrokes to cripple or empower the Commonwealth.<br/><br/>All this to provide a real-time simulation of interstellar civilization and warfare at its finest.<br/><br/>"}, "80021": {"poll": [], "name": "Rubik's Cube", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Blackberry edition", "iPhone Edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Abstract", "Puzzle"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Magmic Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["iPhone", "Other Mobile Devices"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Magmic Inc."], "description": "Of course the classic 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube is included but there are many great variations to play: four different sizes, timed mode, free play, CRAZY Cube and the custom picture cube will keep you coming back for more!<br/><br/>Need a bit of help solving that cube on your desk?

It is the fourth game in the Mega Man X series. The Sega Saturn and PlayStation versions were released simultaneously in Japan on August 1, 1997. A North America release followed in September, while Europe received only the PlayStation version on October 13, 1997. A PC version was released worldwide in 1998.<br/><br/>The gameplay in Mega Man X4 is similar to the previous installments of the Mega Man X series. The player is presented with a series of action-platforming stages that can be cleared in any order desired. In these stages, the player must avoid obstacles like falling debris and spikes, and destroy enemy robots to reach the end of the stages. The player character retains the capabilities from previous entries in the Mega Man X series like dashing and scaling walls. Some levels contain ridable vehicles such as hover bikes and armored-mecha. Each of the eight initial stages contains one Maverick boss, and defeating this boss gives the player a new ability. Every boss is weak to a particular ability, adding an element of strategy to the order in which the player completes the stages.<br/><br/>At the beginning of Mega Man X4, the player chooses to play through the game either as X or Zero. The two characters cannot be switched. Though both of them go through the same stages, they operate differently and are challenged differently from the terrain. X wields the &quot;X-Buster&quot;, a plasma cannon on his arm that he uses to attack foes from a distance. It can be charged to fire stronger shots. A new weapon is given to the player with each boss defeated while playing as X. These weapons have limited ammunition, displayed by a meter next to one's health, both of which can be refilled by picking up power-ups dropped by destroyed enemies. In some stages, the player can find hidden capsules that contain armor upgrades that greatly enhance X's capabilities. Zero is more melee-oriented than X by using a &quot;Z-Saber&quot; sword. The Z-Saber's power and accuracy compensate for its lack of range. Rather than acquiring weapons from bosses, Zero learns special techniques such as the &quot;Hienkyaku&quot; air-dash and &quot;Kuuenbu&quot; double-jump. However, Zero cannot upgrade any of his body parts in this game.<br/><br/>The player character's maximum health can be extended by obtaining a &quot;Heart Tank&quot; in each of the eight stages. Two &quot;Sub Tanks&quot; can also be found, which can be filled with life energy and then be used to replenish the player's health at any time. Two new Tanks have been added: a &quot;Weapon Tank (W-Tank)&quot;, which will fill up all of X's special weapons; and an &quot;EX Tank&quot;, which increases the character's default lives from two to four whenever the player continues from a save point.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Mega Man X4 , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80067": {"poll": [], "name": "Mega Man Xtreme", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["American Game Boy Color Edition", "European Game Boy Color Edition", "Japanese Game Boy Color Edition", "Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console (GBC) edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1041653.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Mega Man X"], "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Capcom Co., Ltd."], "videogamefranchise": ["Mega Man"], "videogameplatform": ["Game Boy Color", "Nintendo 3DS"], "usersrated": "3", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Capcom Co., Ltd."], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1041653_t.jpg", "description": "Mega Man Xtreme, known as Rockman X: Cyber Mission\u200b (\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f3X \u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3) in Japan, is a video game developed by Capcom for the Game Boy Color handheld game console.

It is a spin-off title in the Mega Man X series and is a direct sequel to Mega Man Xtreme, released the previous year. Chronologically, it seems to take place between Mega Man X3 and Mega Man X4, sometime after Mega Man Xtreme.<br/><br/>The game works similarly to the first Mega Man Xtreme title, except that the player can choose between playing as X and playing as Zero. Both have special skills that help them through the stages, but each also has weaknesses as well. X uses his X-Buster to shoot enemies from a distance. It can be charged up to three levels. Zero uses his Z-Saber for close-range combat. He risks taking damage more often by getting closer to enemies, but his slashes are more damaging than X's bullets.<br/><br/>The major change in this game is that X and Zero do not both gain a weapon when a boss is defeated; only the player used to destroy the Maverick will get the special weapon. This adds a hint of strategy to the gameplay, as one must consider not only the order in which they will fight each boss, but whether X or Zero's gained weapons will prove more effective later on, and which are needed to reach power-ups. Also, after each level, the DNA souls gathered in the level will accumulate, which the player can use to buy power-ups from Iris. A difficulty setting called &quot;Extreme Mode&quot; can be unlocked where the player can utilize both X and Zero on any level and can gain different weapons depending on which bosses they defeat.

It was re-released on January 10, 2006 as part of the Mega Man X Collection for the GameCube and PlayStation 2.<br/><br/>X5 was developed by a different team than X4, and this is evident in the style of gameplay. The most prominent difference in this iteration is the time limit of 16 hours (though at points the game or manual claim 24 hours), until the space station Eurasia crashes into Earth. Every time the player enters a stage, one hour is expended. At any point between levels, the player has the option of firing the Enigma at the Eurasia. If the Enigma misses, then the player has the option of launching the shuttle. Whether the crash is prevented or not is determined by random chance. If the crash is not prevented, the course of the story is changed. Due to the nature of the storyline, there are multiple endings. Whether X or Zero is used to defeat the last boss also affects which ending is seen.<br/><br/>The main gameplay remains the same. There are four armors for X&mdash;his Ultimate Armor, the upgraded armor from Mega Man X4, and two others that must be assembled from capsules.

The story follows a young Seattle-based FBI agent named Craig Willmore (played by Jordan Lee Williams) who is assigned by Assistant Director Walter Skinner to investigate the disappearance of agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, who were last seen in the Everett, Washington area. Agent Willmore must use his state-of-the-art spy tools: night vision goggles, a digital camera, PDA (an Apple Newton), lock picks, evidence kit, a standard issue handgun, handcuffs and badge, to follow their trail. Along the way, he is partnered with a Seattle Police Department detective named Mary Astadourian (played by Paige Witte) and a minor subplot involves a relationship developing between the two.<br/><br/>Several of the actors from the TV series reprise their roles in the game, including David Duchovny (Mulder), Gillian Anderson (Scully), Mitch Pileggi (Skinner), Steven Williams (X) and - very briefly and depending upon the outcome of the game, William B. Davis (Cigarette Smoking Man). The game is set and was filmed in Seattle. The TV series actors filmed their relatively brief appearances in the game just before entering production on the feature film. The game's plotline involves aliens taking over the bodies of humans and contains many references to the show's mytharc. During the course of the game the &quot;present day&quot; date of April 1996 is displayed alongside certain locations, placing this &quot;episode&quot; before the season three episode &quot;Wetwired&quot; and after &quot;Avatar&quot;, which take place April 27 and March 7 respectively. This time is also after the first incident with the alien black oil in the &quot;Piper Maru&quot; episode of Season Three.<br/><br/>The screenplay for X-Files The Game was written by Richard Dowdy, from a story by Chris Carter.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;X Files Game&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80076": {"poll": [], "name": "World's Greatest Coasters", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA Windows Edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Amusement Park", "Business/Construction"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Virtual Playground"], "videogamegenre": ["Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Global Star Software"], "description": "You've heard of them.

The game debuted on the aging 16-bit console despite the series having already transitioned to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn with Mega Man 8. Mega Man &amp; Bass was ported to the Game Boy Advance (GBA) handheld in 2002 and was localized overseas in North America and PAL regions the following year. Although Mega Man &amp; Bass shares many traits with previous console games in the series, the ninth numbered title would not be released until several years later.<br/><br/>After the countless defeats of the evil Dr. Wily at the hands of the robot Mega Man, the hero is called into action once again when a powerful being known as King steals the blueprints to the creations of Dr. Wily and Dr. Light in order to create an army for robotic dominance over humans. Having learned of the threat, Mega Man's rival Bass decides to take matters into his own hands. The game is an action-platformer in which the player advances by defeating bosses and acquiring their signature weapons. Mega Man &amp; Bass lets the player choose between either of its titular characters, each of which plays differently than the other. The game has received positive remarks from critics considering its use of a tried-and-true gameplay formula, though some found the difficulty to be too steep.<br/><br/>The gameplay in Mega Man &amp; Bass is similar to earlier games in the series. The player is tasked with completing a series of action-platform stages while overcoming obstacles, solving minor puzzles, and battling enemies. Destroying the &quot;Robot Master&quot; boss at the end of a stage lets the player acquire its special weapon. In previous games, the player generally took on the role of the hero Mega Man. In this game, the player can choose to start the game as either Mega Man or Bass. However, this character must be used for the rest of the game and cannot be changed. Mega Man is able to charge his shots to make them more powerful and has the ability to slide along the ground. Bass is able to rapidly fire his arm cannon in seven directions, though shots cannot be fired while moving or pass through walls unless a certain upgrade is obtained. Bass is also able to double-jump (jump a second time in mid-air) and dash along the ground. Performing both simultaneously lets him cross great distances by doing a dash-jump. Finally, Bass is more susceptible to damage than Mega Man.<br/><br/>The stage structure is different from other games in the series. After the introduction level, the player can only choose between three Robot Masters. Defeating Cold Man unlocks Burner Man and Pirate Man; defeating Astro Man unlocks Dynamo Man; and defeating Ground Man unlocks Magic Man and Tengu Man. Clearing all eight opens the way to the game's final stages. In a similar fashion to previous installments in the series, enemies often drop bolts after they are destroyed, and these can be exchanged for various restorative items and upgrades. Some upgrades are unique to either character, such as Mega Man's ability to call on his dog Rush to search for items, or an adaptor for Bass to combine with his wolf Treble to temporarily fly. Also distributed throughout the introduction and Robot Master levels are a collection of 100 data CDs that contain information on many prominent characters in the series. Most of the CDs are hidden either behind obstacles that need to be destroyed with a special weapon or accessed with a character-specific ability, making it is impossible to collect them all on a single playthrough. CDs collected in each playthrough are permanently placed in a database and remain unlocked after beating the game. Saved games are used in place of the series' traditional password system.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Mega Man &amp; Bass , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80098": {"poll": [], "name": "Test Drive", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US Atari ST edition", "US Commodore 64 edition", "US DOS edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic968430.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Test Drive"], "videogametheme": ["Driving"], "usersrated": "23", "videogamedeveloper": ["Distinctive Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Racing"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "Atari ST", "Commodore 64", "DOS"], "average": "5.99565", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Accolade, Inc."], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic968430_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;In Test Drive, the player typically uses one of several exotic performance cars to race to a finish line against opponents or in a time limit, while avoiding traffic and police.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Test Drive %28series%29 , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80099": {"videogame": ["Mega Man Zero Collection"], "poll": [], "name": "Mega Man Zero", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Game Boy Advance edition", "eShop Wii U Downloadable edition", "Japanese Game Boy Advance edition", "North American Game Boy Advance edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1446854.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Mega Man Zero"], "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Inti Creates Co., Ltd."], "videogamefranchise": ["Mega Man"], "videogameplatform": ["Game Boy Advance", "Wii U"], "usersrated": "11", "average": "7.42273", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Capcom Co., Ltd."], "videogamecompilation": ["Mega Man Zero Collection"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1446854_t.jpg", "description": "Mega Man Zero, known in Japan as Rockman Zero\u200b (\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f3 \u30bc\u30ed), is a video game developed by Capcom for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) handheld game console. It the first installment in the Mega Man Zero series, the fifth series in Capcom's Mega Man video games franchise. It is the first Mega Man platformer to appear on the GBA and was released in Japan on April 26, 2002, in North America on November 9, 2002, and in Europe on November 26, 2002.<br/><br/>Mega Man Zero is set 100 years after the end of the Mega Man X games and follows the Mega Man staple of side-scrolling platform action. The player takes control of the Mega Man X character Zero and guides him across several missions, defeating a boss near the end.<br/><br/>As is common with Mega Man games touching spikes means instant death (except spikes touched during the limited invincibility period granted by taking damage). Continuing the &quot;tradition&quot; from the Mega Man X series, Zero can cling to walls (albeit he slides down it at a uniform rate) and dash. When clinging onto walls, pressing the jump button and the D-pad in the direction opposite to the wall, makes Zero soar off the wall halfway up the screen (referred to in the manual as wall-kick).<br/><br/>Unlike previous Mega Man games, instead of separate stages, there is a mostly single interconnected overworld with the Resistance base at its center, where almost every area in the game can be explored freely (a feature that is removed in later Zero games, but returns in Mega Man ZX). In place of the stages is a choice of missions that Zero can undertake in each of the separate areas of the map, and completing one may unlock others.<br/><br/>There are still bosses to fight in these missions, but not every boss is fought near the end of the stage. It's also possible to fail non-critical missions and continue on with the game, either by using the &quot;Escape Unit&quot; or by choosing to &quot;give up&quot; a mission after losing a life. Doing so marks the mission as a failure, and it will no longer be available; as well the player will miss out on several important items in doing so.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Mega Man Zero (video game) , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80100": {"videogame": ["Mega Man Zero Collection"], "poll": [], "name": "Mega Man Zero 2", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Game Boy Advance edition", "eShop Wii U Downloadable edition", "Japanese Game Boy Advance edition", "North American Game Boy Advance edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1446855.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Mega Man Zero"], "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Inti Creates Co., Ltd."], "videogamefranchise": ["Mega Man"], "videogameplatform": ["Game Boy Advance", "Wii U"], "usersrated": "7", "average": "8.12143", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Capcom Co., Ltd."], "videogamecompilation": ["Mega Man Zero Collection"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1446855_t.jpg", "description": "Mega Man Zero 2, known in Japan as Rockman Zero 2\u200b (\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f3\u30bc\u30ed2), is a video game developed by Inti Creates and published by Capcom for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) handheld game console.

Once again, players are given a variety of weapons that include the Z-Saber, the Buster Shot, and the Shield Boomerang. Zero's skill levels with these weapons are minimal at first, but they will strengthen with repeated use on enemies.<br/><br/>The Triple Rod from the previous game, however, has been replaced with the Chain Rod. It can be used to pull enemies or objects closer, pull shields off enemies or if latched on to an immovable object, to swing over chasms.<br/><br/>Cyber Elves also make a reappearance and once again, they come in three types, Nurse, Animal and Hacker.

It is the third video game in the Mega Man Zero series of Mega Man video games.<br/><br/>This game follows almost the exact same rules as its predecessor, Mega Man Zero 2. Once again, Zero has his Z-Saber, Buster, and Shield Boomerang. However, Zero's rod weapon (originally the Triple Rod in Mega Man Zero and the Chain Rod in Mega Man Zero 2) has been replaced with the Recoil Rod: a pair of tonfa-like weapons that can be aimed in all directions. When charged up, a powerful stabbing attack is performed, which can knock enemies back, or propel Zero into the air if aimed down to the ground, like a makeshift pogo stick. The Cyber Elf system has been given an overhaul with the introduction of Satellite Cyber Elves. These are different from the standard Cyber Elves, which have been renamed &quot;Fusion Elves&quot;, in that they are equipped for a constant benefit, and the use of them will not affect the mission ranking score. However, only two Satellite Elves can be equipped at once.<br/><br/>Cyberspace is a new addition to the game. It is said by one Resistance Member (Hirondelle) that the portal to Cyberspace opened up due to Omega's arrival. Going through the door to Cyberspace leads the player into an area that looks exactly like the one in which they left but with a green tinge to it. Enemy appearances are less frequent and if a transfer of info from a Mega Man Battle Network 4/Mega Man Zero 3 link has been performed, certain virus enemies from the Battle Network Series will appear. All enemies drop health items (instead of other items, such as Secret Disks) in Cyberspace. Entering the Cyberspace causes certain Cyber Elves (both Fusion and Satellite, the ones with the A-mark on the lower left) to auto-activate without dying, even if not grown enough to be normally used, and these Elves do not affect the score. However, going into Cyberspace decreases the mission ranking score, making it more difficult to obtain an S or A Rank, which is needed in order to win EX Skills of the end-of-stage bosses.

It is the fourth and final title in the Mega Man Zero subseries of the Mega Man franchise. The game is set several months after the events of Mega Man Zero 3. The game deals with Dr. Weil's reign over Neo Arcadia in which humans, who have been reduced to second-rate citizens, begin to escape in large numbers to the last known livable location on the planet, Area Zero, beginning a conflict between the two groups. The effects of this war eventually drive Zero and the Resistance to protect Area Zero and its inhabitants from Dr. Weil.<br/><br/>The fourth installment of the Mega Man Zero series introduces gameplay changes, but doesn't deviate platforming of its predecessors. Players guide Zero through eight main selectable stages and usually a mini-boss to separate it into two parts. At the end of each level, the player faces one of the game's reploid antagonists.<br/><br/>Besides the past ties Mega Man Zero 4 also includes a new Easy mode, not found in previous installations of the series, giving into responses that the Mega Man Zero series has been too challenging. In Easy mode, Zero receives a massive life boost, and can use the Cyber Elf without restrictions. However, Easy mode prevents the changing of the weather, and consequentially the acquiring of EX Skills.<br/><br/>The player is still equipped with the Z-Buster and Z-Saber at default. However, in place of the Shield Boomerang and the rod-type weapon from the previous games (Triple Rod, Chain Rod and Recoil Rod) is the new Z-Knuckle that allows Zero to perform several actions, including hanging from pipes, destroying obstacles, stealing an enemy's weapon if Zero destroys it with the Z-Knuckle and acquiring special weapons in certain parts of a stage.<br/>The Weather System can be used to change level conditions, making levels potentially easier<br/><br/>Another new element is the weather system, which allows players to choose between two weather conditions for each of the eight main stages. The difficulty of the stage varies depending on the chosen weather condition, with the stage being harder if the weather icon has an orange border around it. Sometimes, there are secret passages in some stages which the player can only reach by setting the weather to &quot;hard&quot;. The trade-off for an easier level is that Zero cannot learn an EX Skill from a boss.<br/><br/>Cyber Elves, a core element of previous Mega Man Zero installments, are no longer required from the player. Shortly after the introductory levels, a Cyber Elf will arrive for Zero to equip. This elf has most of the powers of the all the Cyber Elves from previous games, which are unlocked as you raise its level by feeding it E-Crystals. Zero may select one power from each of the three categories: Nurse, Animal, and Hacker. The player's ranking at the end of a level is no longer given a penalty for using the Cyber Elves as long as they are kept under the maximum power limit. In addition to this, Zero can now equip body chips to enhance his abilities, including double-jumping and self-recovery, similar to early Mega Man X titles.<br/><br/>Zero cannot rely on finding secret disks to give him enhancements as in Mega Man Zero 3. Instead players must collect enemy parts dropped randomly from defeated enemies. Recipes for combining these parts can be learned by talking to NPCs the player rescues and by talking with a Cyber Elf after its stages of evolution. However, the majority of the recipes are given not through conversation, and instead from random combination of parts.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Mega Man Zero 4 , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80103": {"poll": [], "name": "The Adventures of Rad Gravity", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US NES edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic819441.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["Interplay (Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["NES"], "average": "6", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Activision"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic819441_t.jpg", "description": "The story was that in the far future, humans colonized many planets and established a form a biotechnology, which were sentient beings called Compuminds, which could communicate rapidly from world to world.

The program was a unique hybrid of standard two-dimension map-based tactical gaming, and first person action.<br/><br/>The game was developed by Code Fusion and Digi4Fun. At the time or release, it could lay claim to being &quot;the ONLY true war strategy game that puts you in the middle of the action&quot;.(Microprose's M1 Tank Platoon was similar, but was considered a sim rather than a true strategy game.) The game graphics were garishly bright in colour, though armoured vehicles sported historically accurate camouflage paint jobs, and many touches were added to the three-dimensional world that would remain absent in later, more serious, wargames (such as Combat Mission) such as civilians, telephone poles, and moving railroad trains.<br/><br/>The player would select forces and move them on the two-dimensional battle map, while a tactical AI would resolve battles; however, the player could jump from unit to unit, taking over in a first person capacity. Gameplay was very arcade-like, and damage modelling was unrealistic in the extreme. Heavy machine guns could be used to knock stone buildings into piles of rubble, for example, and individual penetration statistics of the various weapons and armoured vehicles seem to have been fictional. As well, limitations of the game engine restricted engagement ranges to a few hundred metres.<br/><br/>Up to 100 units could be controlled in the overhead two-dimensional mode. The three-dimensional mode featured a very simplistic and generic graphics interface for vehicle controls.<br/><br/>Players could control British, American, or German forces. Weather effects were included, such as snow and rain falling in the 3D world, and terrain was realistic and textured, with such things as bullrushes in the swampy areas and decorative lamp posts in the urban areas. Sound effects were good, though all voices in the game spoke with a British accent, giving sometimes comical responses &quot;Get out! Get out!&quot; when infantry were unloaded, for example, or an apologetic &quot;oops&quot; when a civilian was crushed under your tank.<br/><br/>Terrain was deformable, with trees being crushed under the weight of vehicles and buildings collapsing under high explosive fire.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Muzzle Velocity (video game),&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80112": {"poll": [], "name": "Mega Man Battle Network", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["eShop Wii U Downloadable edition", "North American GBA edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1182020.png", "videogameseries": ["Mega Man Battle Network"], "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "videogamefranchise": ["Mega Man"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Capcom Co., Ltd.", "Capcom Production Studio 2"], "videogamegenre": ["Action RPG", "Tactical Role-Playing Game"], "videogameplatform": ["Game Boy Advance", "Wii U"], "usersrated": "13", "average": "6.67308", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Capcom Co., Ltd."], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1182020_t.png", "description": "Mega Man Battle Network, known as Battle Network Rockman EXE\u200b in Japan, is a video game developed by Capcom for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) handheld game console.

With the fourth release of the V&amp;V internet freebies, we decided to take a slightly different route and toy around with the concept of a &ldquo;role playing game playset&rdquo;. This is something that I&rsquo;ve been thinking about adding to the role playing experience for the last few years, but never really had the chance to give much of a serious thought. My idea for role playing game playsets came from the days of my youth when it was possible to purchase dozens of different toy playsets for a wide array of action figures. Such toys provided a colorful location and a few extra accessories, you supplied the action figures and the plots from your own imagination. I personally wanted to see a potential experiment like that for V&amp;V, where we supplied the location and a few extras, and the GM and players provided the adventure plots and the main characters. Unlike a typical adventure module, the &ldquo;playset&rdquo; setting would be built with the intention that it could be reused in the campaign over and over again. The playset would also be different than the regular action maps that we offer in the sense that it would be more geared towards the ownership and general use of a super powered character (or characters).  <br/><br/><br/>Diamantes is the first of such planned playsets for V&amp;V and may be a bit different than some (but not all) of the other playsets to come in the sense that it also offers the seemingly mundane business setting that is to found with the typical action maps. Although we plan to release more of these playset settings in the future, it is important to note that they will not be replacing the action maps. In fact, unless various needs or interests sway us otherwise, we are currently considering the prospect of keeping this 3 to 1 ratio trend that we have now. In other words, for every three (or so) action maps you see released, you can also expect to see one playset setting map released as well. <br/> So what is Diamantes? Imagine a posh, jazzy night spot that features elegant live entertainment and gourmet old world cuisine. This is the sort of place where people go to see and to be seen and to look extremely casual and unconcerned that they just ordered a $200 bottle of wine. Imagine that tucked away below this restaurant there&rsquo;s an illegal casino, run by the same owner as the restaurant, where a mixture of the city&rsquo;s wealthy and corrupt come out to play. Now imagine that just beyond the walls of this casino there&rsquo;s an underground base of operations that caters to the needs of the criminal mind that controls all that is Diamantes. <br/><br/><br/>So just who is the boss? The boss can be any villain you like. It can be one that is supplied by an existing V&amp;V product, a pre-existing character of your own design in your campaign, or perhaps even a brand new criminal threat that you may be planning to unleash on the unsuspecting heroes. The choice is yours. <br/><br/><br/>Enjoy! <br/> Dave Woodrum <br/>FGU Designer/Writer<br/><br/>"}, "80134": {"rpgdesigner": ["Stacy Smith", "David Woodrum"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Second Hand Book Shop", "rpgartist": ["David Woodrum"], "rpgproducer": ["Scott B.

I tend to frequent the used bookstores located near my home and I tend to check out one or two when I&rsquo;m away on vacation. One never knows what they might find in such places, making every trip to such a real life adventure in itself! As for the interests of gaming, a used bookstore offers a great deal of potential for the GM. Such a place could be a front for illegal or sinister activities, or it might be a friendly place where the heroes can stop in to gain possible clues about the ongoing activities of the city. In the least, the layout of the <br/>bookstore offers a new public place where yet another battle may erupt.<br/><br/>The layout of the bookstore is a wee bit different than the previous freebie offerings. The careful reader will note that unlike the other previous action maps, the presence of a parking lot has been removed. Such change was intentional. While the bookstore might possibly located in a separate building resting on its own lot, many of these shops are usually nestled in the confines of a small shopping center or along a back street series of urban brownstone. Another feature that is different from many of the prior freebies is the brevity of the product. This was also intentional. The shop should be fairly small and overloading with details detracts from the shop&rsquo;s flexibility of different uses.  <br/> Game On! <br/>Dave Woodrum and Stacy Smith<br/><br/>"}, "80135": {"poll": [], "name": "Ratatouille", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Wii edition", "North American Windows edition"], "average": "8.3", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Asobo Studio", "Heavy Iron Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["GameCube", "Nintendo DS", "PlayStation 2", "PlayStation 3", "Wii", "Windows", "Xbox 360"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["THQ"], "description": "Relive all the film's most thrilling and hilarious moments as you assume the role of Remy, a young rat who dreams of becoming a great French chef, despite the obvious problem of being a rat!

It is the second game of the Mega Man Battle Network series . It was released in 2001 in Japan and 2002 in America and Europe. The story of the game starts after the events of Mega Man Network Transmission. This is the only game in the Battle Network series to have profanity in it, with words such as &quot;damn,&quot; &quot;hell,&quot; and &quot;crap.&quot;<br/><br/>The general gameplay is essentially identical to that of the original Mega Man Battle Network game; indeed, the two games utilize a significant amount of the same graphics. However, Battle Network 2 introduces several new concepts that augment the original game-system.<br/><br/>In terms of health, Mega Man no longer heals fully and automatically after each battle. Furthermore, the game introduces the SubChip, a device similar in basic concept to a battle chip but one that can only be activated outside of battle.<br/><br/>Where in the original, a player had only one chip folder, Battle Network 2 introduces the possibility of alternate active folders, allowing players to easily customize their range of possible attacks to conform to multiple situations. Notably, chips used in one active folder are not available for the construction of a second, even though only one folder may be used at any given time. Up to three folders can be found in this game, and all are fully customizable. As in the previous game, folders may have up to five Navi chips each and only five of the same kind of any chip.<br/><br/>Aside from the addition of new Battle Chips in general, Battle Network 2 expanded the old chip code system, which had previously been limited only to the alphabet. Some Chips could occur with an asterisk (*) as their code letter, a wild card symbol meaning the Chip can be used with any other Chip. This game is the only Battle Network game (besides 6) where it is possible (from one chip trader only) to get * coded Navi chips. There are now 250 chips possible in single player mode, with chips 251-260 possible only via NetBattling, and chip #261 (Sanctuary) earned when the player completes Hard Mode. Players can also now earn up to five stars on the title screen by completing major tasks in the game.<br/><br/>Additionally, players may access NetSquares in the game. These places serve as a sort of Town Square for NetNavis and their operators to relax, buy supplies, and exchange information.<br/><br/>One final change was the replacement of the old armor system, which only affected damage received, with a style system that affects damage received, attack damage, physical appearance, among other benefits. During the course of the game MegaMan may take on one of five Styles (Guts, Team, Custom, Shield, and Hub), each of which will also be aligned with one of four elements (Heat, Wood, Elec, and Aqua). He can store up to two styles in his memory at once and change out when not battling. Also see Style Change for a more detailed description.<br/><br/>Starting with Battle Network 2, anytime a chip trader is used, the game will automatically save when the player receives their new chip. This is to prevent the player from cheating by simply soft resetting without saving until the chip trader gives out a desirable chip, which was possible in the first game. Another chip trader tradition that starts with this game and continues on for the remainder of the series is that there is one ten chip trader that will appear only upon completing Story Mode (yellow star), and gives out the best chips of all the chip traders. This is also the only game that strays from the traditional chip trader colors (blue 3-chip trader, red 10-chip trader); it uses red for the 3-chip trader and yellow for the 10-chip trader.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Mega Man Battle Network 2&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80140": {"poll": [], "name": "Mega Man Battle Network 3", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["American GBA Edition", "European GBA Edition", "Japanese GBA Black Edition", "Japanese GBA Original Edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1455596.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Mega Man Battle Network"], "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "videogamegenre": ["Tactical Role-Playing Game"], "usersrated": "5", "videogamedeveloper": ["Capcom Co., Ltd.", "Capcom Production Studio 2"], "videogamefranchise": ["Mega Man"], "videogameplatform": ["Game Boy Advance"], "videogamehonor": ["2001\u20132002 Japan Game Awards Best Unreleased Game Winner"], "average": "8.3", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Capcom Co., Ltd."], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1455596_t.jpg", "description": "Mega Man Battle Network 3, known as Battle Network Rockman EXE 3\u200b (\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af \u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f3\u30a8\u30b0\u30bc3) in Japan, is a video game developed by Capcom for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) handheld game console. It is the third game in the Mega Man Battle Network series, released in 2002 in Japan and 2003 in North America. While in North America and Europe, two complementary versions of the game - Blue and White - exist, marketed simultaneously, this was not the case in Japan. The game was released in a single version in this region, while a Black\u200b (\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af) version containing bugfixes, new areas, optional bosses, and other improvements, was released some months after the original.<br/><br/>The gameplay in Battle Network 3 is similar to that of its predecessors, with no graphical enhancements and minor gameplay changes. Gone are the Power-Ups that were to be collected to improve the MegaBuster - instead the Navi Customizer is added, allowing abilities to be added on with certain rules as to how these abilities can be added with respect to each other.<br/><br/>Each version of the game has a separate Contest Navi: BowlMan for Blue/Black, and MistMan for White. Blue also includes another Navi, Punk, that could be challenged from time to time. Punk's chip was only available as part of a special promotion in Japan. However, it can be attained via a cheat device or by being traded from Black to Blue. White, on the other hand, has no such Navi.<br/><br/>In Battle Network 3 the virus breeder is available, where special, friendly viruses (that must be found first somewhere in the net) are kept and can be fed using BugFrags. When a virus is found and put in the breeder, a chip for that virus is obtained. Feeding each virus BugFrags levels up their chip accordingly. After a family of a certain type of virus has been fed to the max, they will release information to the player as to where the Omega Virus of that family (i.e. For the KillerEye family, they will give you a clue to find KillerEye Omega) can be found. After the Omega Virus of that family is found and deleted, it will join the others in the Virus Breeder and will be available when the corresponding Virus Chip is used.<br/><br/>Battle Network 3 introduces further classification of Battle Chips by splitting them into three categories: 200 white Standard chips, 85 blue Mega chips and 25 pink Giga chips. Standard Chips are limited to only four of each kind (even if letter codes are different) per folder. Mega Chips are limited to only five per folder, and only one of each kind. Only one Giga Chip is allowed per folder and only one copy of each Giga chip exists throughout the entire game. These specifications would continue for the remainder of the series. There are certain types of programs (see Navi Customizer) that can boost the Mega and Giga chip limits, though. There are five unique Giga chips exclusive to each version and this would continue for the remainder of the series, although Battle Network 5 offers six Giga chips per version. There are also Program advances which are a combination of three or four chips.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Mega Man Battle Network 3&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80141": {"poll": [], "name": "Mega Man Battle Network 4", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["American GBA Edition - Blue Moon", "American GBA Edition - Red Sun", "European GBA Edition - Blue Moon", "European GBA Edition - Red Sun", "Japanese Game Boy Advance Edition - Blue Moon", "Japanese Game Boy Advance Edition - Red Sun"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1144976.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Mega Man Battle Network"], "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "videogamegenre": ["Tactical Role-Playing Game"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Capcom Co., Ltd.", "Capcom Production Studio 2"], "videogamefranchise": ["Mega Man"], "videogameplatform": ["Game Boy Advance"], "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Capcom Co., Ltd."], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1144976_t.jpg", "description": "Mega Man Battle Network 4, known as Battle Network Rockman EXE 4\u200b in Japan, is a video game developed by Capcom for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) handheld game console. It is the fourth game in the Mega Man Battle Network series. Like the game before it, Battle Network 4 has two different versions, Red Sun and Blue Moon, that differ only in minor story and gameplay details. Battle Network 4 is compatible with the e-Reader, and can be linked up with Rockman EXE 4.5 Real Operation and the Battle Chip Gate for NetBattles. It is able to link with Mega Man Zero 3, and contains references to Konami's Boktai series.<br/><br/>Battle Network 4 greatly differs from Battle Network 3 in many ways, the most notable of which is the concept of DoubleSoul (Soul Unison in the original). DoubleSoul is similar to how the classic-style Mega Man could acquire the weapons of the Robot Masters that he has defeated: by using DoubleSoul, MegaMan.EXE could use the powers of other NetNavis in the same manner as how classic Mega Man could use the powers of the Robot Masters through their weapons. To perform a DoubleSoul, which lasts for a temporary amount of time (three turns), however, a chip must be sacrificed for the battle.<br/><br/>Another key feature is that it takes a minimum of three playthroughs of the game's main story mode in order to uncover all of its secrets - although many criticize the game for the same reason. After each playthrough, a player is permitted to either continue with their existing game or to start a new game at a higher level of difficulty, although any save at a higher level of difficulty will overwrite a save of the lower level. Thus, it is very important for those players who want to collect all chips and power-ups to be sure that all blue/purple mystery datas and all V1 virus' chips and program advances have been collected before starting Level 2. The same is true for going on to Level 3.<br/><br/>Finally, DarkChips, which are powerful chips that give many negative side-effects, make their debut in this game: a mood indicator in the corner of the screen shows the mood of MegaMan, and should the mood change to a negative one, random DarkChips will appear in MegaMan's Custom Screen. Each DarkChip will have many negative (and a notable permanent) side-effects, and will taint MegaMan's own soul with darkness. Should the darkness overwhelm MegaMan, he will find that a different selection of chips are made available to use, with a different selection of Program Advances (like the infamous &quot;DarkNeo&quot; Program Advance, which involves the Bass GigaChip) therein. Also, when you use a DarkChip (aside from the battle with ShadeMan in the ToyRobo and in free tournaments at Higsby's shop), MegaMan permanently loses 1 HP for each and cannot regain all HP lost, even if you were to purify yourself. There are also special chips (like the 5 evil chips) that can only be used if MegaMan is completely consumed by dark power. Conversely, if MegaMan does enough battles (about 1000) without ever using a Dark Chip, he will turn brighter in color and allow him to more easily achieve Full Syncro mode.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Mega Man Battle Network 4&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80142": {"poll": [], "name": "Mega Man Battle Network 5", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Game Boy Advance edition", "English/European Game Boy Advance edition", "English/European Nintendo DS edition", "Japanese Game Boy Advance edition", "Japanese Game Boy Advance edition", "Japanese Nintendo DS edition", "North American Game Boy Advance edition", "North American Game Boy Advance edition", "North American Nintendo DS edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1444874.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Mega Man Battle Network"], "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "videogamegenre": ["Tactical Role-Playing Game"], "usersrated": "3", "videogamedeveloper": ["Capcom Co., Ltd.", "Capcom Production Studio 2"], "videogamefranchise": ["Mega Man"], "videogameplatform": ["Game Boy Advance", "Nintendo DS"], "videogamehonor": ["2004 Japan Game Awards Best Unreleased Game Winner"], "average": "7.16667", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Capcom Co., Ltd."], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1444874_t.jpg", "description": "Mega Man Battle Network 5, known as Battle Network Rockman EXE 5\u200b (\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af \u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f3\u30a8\u30b0\u30bc5) in Japan, is a video game developed by Capcom for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) and Nintendo DS handheld game consoles. It it is the fifth game in the Mega Man Battle Network series, and the first Mega Man game to be released on the Nintendo DS. Battle Network 5 comes in three different versions: Mega Man Battle Network 5: Team Proto Man\u200b (\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f3\u30a8\u30b0\u30bc5 \u30c1\u30fc\u30e0 \u30aa\u30d6 \u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30b9 Rockman EXE 5 Team of Blues) and Mega Man Battle Network 5: Team Colonel\u200b (\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f3\u30a8\u30b0\u30bc5 \u30c1\u30fc\u30e0 \u30aa\u30d6 \u30ab\u30fc\u30cd\u30eb Rockman EXE Team of Colonel), both for the Game Boy Advance, which have similar gameplay but slightly different supporting characters and stories, and Mega Man Battle Network 5: Double Team DS\u200b (\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f3\u30a8\u30b0\u30bc5DS \u30c4\u30a4\u30f3\u30ea\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30ba Rockman EXE 5 DS Twin Leaders) for the Nintendo DS, which includes the content from both games as well as extra content.<br/><br/>Gameplay in Mega Man Battle Network 5 in this game is largely similar to that of its predecessors. The intrepid youngster Lan Hikari and his NetNavi (a sentient computer program) MegaMan.EXE must work to defeat the once-again-revived Nebula crime syndicate. Lan explores the real world and interacts with people and places there. When Lan jacks his PET, a handheld computer, into a computer with an interface jack (of which there are many), he can upload Mega Man to the cyber network. In that network, Mega Man can explore, but he's also threatened by viruses.<br/>MegaMan battles viruses in Double Team DS.<br/><br/>When Mega Man encounters viruses (or, later, hostile NetNavis), the screen shifts to a battle screen, set on a six by three square grid. On the left half of the grid is Mega Man, and on the other half are his opponents. Mega Man has a relatively weak arm cannon, the MegaBuster, but his main weapon is Lan's library of battle chips, one-use-per-battle special attacks which grant various abilities, including simple attacks, defensive effects, terrain transmogrification, or assistance from other Navis. Before battle, the player can construct a folder consisted of thirty battle chips, and each turn of a battle (measured by a timer bar at the top of the screen), the player is presented with a random selection of these chips. The player can send Mega Man up to five battle chips, after which the battle takes place in real time, with MegaMan, controlled by the player, attacking with his MegaBuster, dodging attacks, or activating battle chips from his queue.<br/><br/>As implied by the games' titles, other Navis besides Mega Man play a much larger role. Mega Man joins a team led by either Lan's and Mega Man's rivals Chaud and ProtoMan.EXE or new characters Baryl and Colonel.EXE, and the members of this team assist MegaMan in various ways. Soul Unisons, originally introduced in Mega Man Battle Network 4 return: by using a chip of the right element to activate a Soul Unison (instead of its normal effects), Mega Man can take on the attributes of one of his teammates. For example, if Mega Man Soul Unisons with ProtoMan, his MegaBuster becomes a WideSwrd attack.<br/>MegaMan uses his LongSwrd special ability in the second liberation mission in Team ProtoMan.<br/><br/>The team plays its largest role in Liberation missions. In Liberation missions, Mega Man and the rest of his team enter a part of the internet controlled by the Nebula crime syndicate, in order to free it from their control. Each Navi works autonomously, choosing corrupted Dark Panels to Liberate, or clear of Nebula's influence, to clear a path to the boss Navi controlling the area. Attempting to liberate a panel leads to a time-limited battle with a group of viruses. Each Navi has different abilities, including a unique chip always available to them in battle, a different weapon in place of the MegaBuster, and an out-of-battle ability which can clear multiple panels, protect teammates from damage, or other effects. These out-of-battle abilities almost always require Order Points, limiting their use. There is also a turn &quot;goal&quot; for each Liberation mission, with one turn representing the entire team of Navis attempting a liberation mission (or resting to restore HP). There are two Mega chips to be earned per liberation mission, one for completing the liberation mission on target or one turn less, and the better Mega chip for completing the liberation target in two or more turns less. Thus the player must actually complete each Liberation mission twice to earn both Mega Chips. Completing the liberation mission with more turns than the target will only earn zenny.<br/><br/>Also new to Mega Man Battle Network 5 are Dark Chips, super-powerful chips. While they appeared randomly in Mega Man Battle Network 4 when Mega Man was badly damaged, they are much more like normal battle chips in this game, in that they can be added to the battle chip folder like any other chip. Their extra power comes with a price: every time Mega Man uses a Dark Chip, he loses one point from his maximum hit points, permanently. He can, however, use a Dark Chip for a Soul Unison; this is called a Chaos Unison, which is like a normal Soul Unison except that his MegaBuster is replaced with the effects of the Dark Chip he used for the Chaos Unison. While using this effect doesn't cause HP loss, it has to be done with careful timing, as charging with poor timing causes the Chaos Unison to end and an invincible, evil version of Mega Man to join the viruses and attack Mega Man for a short period of time using random battlechips.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Mega Man Battle Network 5&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>Box Description:<br/><br/>Seize the internet!<br/><br/>A mysterious Navis force has taken control of the Internet!!

As with the previous three games, the Japanese edition was released in two separate versions: Denn\u014dj\u016b Falzer\u200b (\u96fb\u8133\u7363\u30d5\u30a1\u30eb\u30b6\u30fc) and Denn\u014dj\u016b Glaga\u200b (\u96fb\u8133\u7363\u30b0\u30ec\u30a4\u30ac). The North American releases are titled Cybeast Falzar and Cybeast Gregar. Later, Japan re-released these games in combo packs with a special colored version of the &quot;Battle Chip Gate&quot;, or &quot;Beast Link Gate&quot;. This special combo pack was called the Rockman EXE 6 Beast Link Gate DX Edition and contained a special Blue &quot;Netto&quot; version of the Beast Link Gate and one of the games' two versions.<br/><br/>Battle Network 6 marks the end of the Game Boy Advance Battle Network series, as shown in the ending. Keiji Inafune has stated in an interview that EXE6 is indeed the final game in the series. It takes place months after Battle Network 5, and Lan's father has been moved to work in Cyber City, forcing Lan to move there as well. He learns of two ancient and dangerous Net creatures known as Cybeasts as well as the return of WWW who are trying to awaken the beasts. Lan must do whatever it takes to stop them and destroy the Cybeasts before they destroy the Net.<br/><br/>There are many changes in gameplay in Battle Network 6. One of which is the chip-limiting system. It limits how many of the same chips the player can keep in a folder depending on its MB.<br/><br/>Another one is a slight change in the Navi Customizer. Parts can be placed off the map, allowing the player to install more programs, but at the risk of having a bug.<br/><br/>There are Link Navis can be controlled by the player, and have their own special chip, like MegaMan's allies in BN5. However, these Navis can go about the net freely like MegaMan, although their jack-in point is fixed. Link Navi Charged Shots and special chip damage can no longer upgrade themselves. Instead, they are buster-dependent, giving buster-improving chips some more use. Link Navis can also get rid of obstacles that obstruct MegaMan's path, allowing him to reap rewards like mystery data containing rare items, or allowing access to Net Navis with secret information. The Link Navis include Aqua Man in the Falzar version, and Heat Man in the Greger version. The main drawback to playing as another Navi however, is that they cannot use the Navi Customizer.<br/><br/>Another new introduction is the Tag Chip System, which allows players to &quot;tag&quot; 2 chips together as long as the combined MB of the chips is 60 or lower. These chips will appear side by side in the Custom Screen when either one of them is drawn. This system has allowed players to access low-MB chip combos or Program Advances with ease. Chips chosen as tag chips cannot be set as regular chips.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Mega Man Battle Network 6&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80145": {"poll": [], "name": "Fetch!", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA Windows Edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Animals"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Virtual Playground"], "videogamegenre": ["Life Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "videogamehonor": ["2014 D.I.C.E.

Then the alien gives Arnold an odd metal rod, a fork and a coin, which turns him into Bravoman, a bionic tokusatsu hero who possesses telescopic limbs that can be used to fight against Dr. Bomb and his henchmen.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Bravoman&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80213": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "A Touch of Fate", "rpgdesigner": ["Sean Cox"], "rpgproducer": ["Sean Cox"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic791356.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "2.9", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpg": ["A Touch of Fate"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpgseries": ["2010 RPG Geek 24 Hour RPGs"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic791356_t.jpg", "description": "From the Game's Introduction:<br/><br/>How would the world be different if each of us had the opportunity to truly see what we are capable of?

These stories can be comedic, dramatic, or even tragic - the best ones will demonstrate all of these qualities. As such it's much more of a collective story telling game than a traditional RPG because many of the scenes and narratives will take place as stories being told about things that happen in the past rather than in the here and now.<br/><br/>Retrospect is a GM-less game that can be played in one to two sessions: Some games will last only a couple of hours, others might take longer depending on how many players you have, how much depth the individual scenes go in to as well as whether or not your band implodes from internal or external forces.

If the player chooses normal mode, several changes will occur in comparison to if the player chooses easy. Characters will have a limit to how much their health meter may extend (about half of their maximum in easy mode). Levels will also sport more enemies in normal mode, and should the player die playing with either the dragon, golem, or mouse, that character will no longer be selectable until the player beats the level. Little Samson on the other hand will always be playable, and because of which, he alone can complete almost all the levels alone (exceptions being the introductory levels and the very last level).<br/><br/>A unique feature of the game is that the player may switch characters at any point during the level. Each character has their own health gauge, but they all share the same &ldquo;lives&rdquo; (if the character which the player is using dies than they lost a life and all heroes' health gauges are restored). This unique setup makes the game's stages much more easy to complete than many other similar games and allows for unique strategies when facing the game's boss characters, which the player must face at the end of many stages. When confronted the boss' health is displayed in a similar fashion to the player's but on the right side of the screen.

TwinBee marked the debut of Japanese animator Jujiro Hamakawa (credited under the pen name Shuzilow.HA) as the series' primary character designer for every subsequent installment. Detana!! TwinBee was awarded &quot;Best Shooting Game of 1991&quot; by the Japanese arcade game magazine Gamest.<br/><br/>Set several years after the events of the original TwinBee, TwinBee and WinBee are relaxing at their island when they receive an SOS  signal from the distant planet of Meru. The signal contains a message sent by Queen Melora, who pleads for the salvation of her planet from the invading forces of the evil alien Iva. TwinBee and his friends decides to set off to outer space to defeat the forces of Iva and save Planet Meru. Detana!!  marks the first appearance of TwinBee's and WinBee's respective pilots, Light and Pastel, who became prominent characters in many subsequent TwinBee  video games and related media, although they were originally unnamed in this game (the characters were given their names in the audio drama TwinBee Paradise).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Detana!!

An additional two secret characters from previous Video System games can be accessed by entering a code. Various characters can carry different numbers of power-ups (P) and bombs (B) before reaching full stock; picking either of these up while fully stocked grants the player 2,000 points, while a full-power (F) grants 10,000.<br/><br/>Destroying large enemies on the ground, as well as buildings and other prominent bits of scenery, will frequently reveal any of the above powerups as well as currency icons, which change depending upon the nationality of the player's character. Currency icons are worth anywhere between 10,000 and 200 points each; picking the icons up at the very top of the screen nets the maximum, picking them up more than halfway down nets the minimum.<br/><br/>The game contains a total of eighteen stages, of which eight will be played in each of the game's two loops using a branching system. After killing the bosses of certain stages, a plane will appear with two destructible wings; whichever wing is destroyed first determines the next stage that is played. Stages 3 and 6 are always bonus stages; these have no boss, and will either contain enemies which release lots of power-ups which can be collected for 2,000 points each, or a large number of non-firing ground enemies which release currency.<br/><br/>The game also contains a number of secrets; both of the last bosses will very rarely be replaced by hidden bosses, who also grant hidden endings. Some smaller enemies will sometimes exhibit unusual behaviour; for example, the gun turrets in the USA stage will occasionally turn into a bust of Villiam from Aero Fighters.<br/><br/>In two-player mode, players must use any two planes which are on the same row as each other on the character select screen. During gameplay, if both players' sprites sit exactly on top of each other, a powerful combined shot will be fired as long as neither player uses a bomb.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Aero Fighters 3&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80251": {"poll": [], "name": "Sonic Wings Limited", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Arcade Edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1575642.png", "videogameseries": ["Aero Fighters"], "videogametheme": ["Flight", "War - Future"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Video System"], "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Video System"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1575642_t.png", "description": "Sonic Wings Special is the 4th arcade game for the Sonic Wings shooter.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Sonic Wings Limited&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80252": {"videogame": ["Air Commander"], "poll": [], "name": "F-16 Combat Pilot", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "vgcharacterversion": ["General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic964089.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Military", "War - Modern"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamecharacter": ["General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Digital Integration"], "videogamegenre": ["Flight Simulator"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "DOS"], "videogameversion": ["North American Amiga edition", "North American DOS 3.5\" Disk edition", "North American DOS 5-1/4\" Disk edition"], "average": "6", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Electronic Arts (EA)"], "videogamecompilation": ["Air Commander"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic964089_t.jpg", "description": "F-16 Combat Pilot is a F-16 fighter flight simulator made by Digital Integration for Commodore 64, Amstrad, PC, Amiga and Atari ST in 1988.

In A.D. 2064 World War III broke out after several clashes between the World Republic Federation, the ruling government body on Earth, and its enemies around the world. Weapons of Mass Destruction were utilized by both factions of the war without hesitation, razing the lands on Earth. The declining situation lead the people to believe that the end of the world was nearing, but the critical situation forced both factions to declare a ceasefire. In the aftermath of the war, most of the Earth's population has been killed and the natural environment was deteriorating at an alarming rate.<br/><br/>The surviving population of mankind were forced to live in the confinement of underground cities and the countries banded together to form an organization known as the Greater United Nations. The Universal Science and Technology Administration or USTA was established by the Greater United Nations, its mission was to locate a new home planet for mankind in the far reaches of outer space. A.D. 2087, Professor Trillas Bachtein succeeded in his warp drive experiments which was a breakthrough in space travel. In S.D. 0001, the first year of the newly established Spacedate calendar, the USTA secretly put in motion its Space Reconnaissance Force or SRF project which would then in S.D. 0010 send the first human expedition into outer space to locate a suitable planet for the relocation of mankind.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>The Last Hope utilizes the same real time battle system like previous games in the series, new features include a new Rush Gauge and Blindsides. The Rush gauge allows players to perform a pre-emptive strike against his opponent or use a special ability or attack. Each character will have and utilize their own individual Rush gauge. Blindsides allow the player to counter attack an enemy who is targeting the player by slipping behind the enemy quickly out of his line of sight and launching a pre-emptive strike on the enemy from his back. Another new system is the increase in the number of characters that can be controlled and fought with in battle to four, instead of the three from Star Ocean: Till the End of Time.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Star Ocean: The Last Hope&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80270": {"videogame": ["The Complete Universal Military Simulator"], "poll": [], "name": "The Universal Military Simulator", "videogamemode": ["AI Only", "Hotseat", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA Amiga 3.5\" Disk", "North American Apple II edition", "North American Atari ST edition", "North American DOS edition", "North American Macintosh edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic929327.jpg", "videogameseries": ["The Universal Military Simulator"], "videogametheme": ["Military"], "usersrated": "3", "videogameexpansion": ["UMS II: Nations at War", "The War College: Universal Military Simulator 3"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Telecomsoft"], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "Apple II", "Atari ST", "DOS", "Macintosh"], "average": "2", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Telecomsoft"], "videogamecompilation": ["The Complete Universal Military Simulator"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic929327_t.jpg", "description": "The Universal Military Simulator is a computer game developed by Rainbird Software in 1987 for Apple II, Macintosh, Tandy 4000, and IBM microcomputers and compatibles.

It is based on the classic British comic strip Dan Dare. The game is noticeably different on each platform.<br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>The Mekon reveals his typically-dastardly plan: Earth must submit to his terms or he will propel a hollowed-out asteroid the size of a small planet into Earth. Dan and his sidekick Digby fly to the asteroid in Dan's spaceship, the Anastasia. Arriving at the asteroid they find small buildings and structures and realise it must be inhabited. Digby remains on the ship whilst Dan is lowered down to the asteroid's surface. Once again, Earth is relying on him to defeat the Mekon.<br/><br/>Spectrum version<br/><br/>Dan is armed with only a laser gun. He must progress through the levels, acquiring the five pieces of an explosive device. Each piece is hidden somewhere within a section of the game, the first piece collected unlocks the door to the area containing the second piece and so on. On the way he encounters foot soldiers, also known as Treens, (which he can shoot but which shoot back), floorguns (which can be destroyed by jumping on them) and wall guns (which can usually be destroyed by shooting them).<br/><br/>Any enemy contact or getting shot will cause Dan to lose energy. If it reaches zero, Dan is &quot;captured&quot; and returned to a prison cell from which he then escapes, however it is some distance from most of the accessible parts of the complex and also causes lost time. Should Dan fire too much, his gun will run out of ammo (which can be replenished by collecting ammo powerups). Should Dan run out of time before he can assemble the five parts of the bomb, the Mekon has won again.<br/><br/>Commodore 64 version<br/><br/>Dan does not use a gun in this version, preferring to deal with Treen guards by using his boxing skills. He must progress first through the planet's surface and subterranean lakes, where he must solve various puzzles and collect items to enable him to progress down into the Mekon's heavily-guarded base. Here he must fight hordes of Treen guards, find and free Digby and the Professor, before destroying three supercomputers with a giant laser. The final scene sees Dan tackling the Mekon in a hand-to-hand grenade battle. Having destroyed the Mekon, he has just two minutes to return to the planet's surface and escape.<br/><br/>The whole game takes place over 25 minutes in real time. Dan fails the mission if he has not destroyed the Mekon and escaped within this time.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Dan Dare: Pilot of the Future&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80293": {"poll": [], "name": "Krakels ABC: Det Magiska \u00c4ventyret", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Swedish Windows edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Krakels ABC"], "videogametheme": ["Children's"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["ELD Interaktiv Produktion AB"], "videogamegenre": ["Educational"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Levande B\u00f6cker"], "description": "User summary<br/>Pedagogical childrens game intended to be an aid in learing to read and write.<br/><br/>Characters from Lennart Hellsings books are used in the game.

Of the Zyntrac Galaxy, the four closest galactic sectors contain the most energy and power of any galactic sectors in the universe.  The very essence of this untapped power is reason inough for all Interstellar War Lords to battle for possession of them.  Players become Interstellar War Lords in Star Siege and use the forces of the Black Hole to gain strategic power over their oppenents, thus limiting their movements and eventually eliminating them from the game.  Enter the Star Siege and let yourself be cast into a galaxy where space and time do collide.<br/><br/>OBJECT OF THE GAME is to conquer the universe by strategically occupying planets in such a manner as to limit your opponent's movements and eliminate them from the game.<br/><br/>EQUIPMENT includes a game board, one die, 16 men and 144 planetary chips.<br/><br/>The Star Siege game board is separated into four galactic sectors:  Sector 1 is the closest sector to the Black Hole and contains 6 planets.  Sectors 2 and 3 are the second and third closest to the Black Hole and contain 12 planets each.  Sector 4 is the farthest from the Black Hole and contains 6 planets.<br/><br/>Each player receives 4 men of one colour and can use 1 to 4 men per game.  All players must use the same number of men.<br/><br/>Each player receives 36 planetary chips of one colour.  These are used to designate ownership of planets.  When players come to rest on a planet they place one of their planetary chips in the space provided and place their men on top.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY:  Roll of die determines order of play.  First player places one of him men and planetary chips on any unoccupied planet of his choice.  Play continues in a clockwise direction with each player doing the same until all planets are occupied.  Die is now re-rolled to determine who moves first.<br/><br/>When a players man comes to rest upon an opponents unprotected planet, he invades that planet and replaces the man and chip with his own.<br/><br/>Players try to enter the Black Hole by moving up along their own planets.  Upon entering the Black Hole the player can move his man to any unprotected planet on the board.<br/><br/>A player's man can only be eliminated from the game when it is &quot;stranded&quot;.  A player is said to be stranded when one of his men is surrounded by his opponent's planets.<br/><br/>A player is out of the game when all of his men have been eliminated.<br/><br/>Game comes with instructions for basic, intermediate, advanced and expert level play.<br/><br/>"}, "80300": {"poll": [], "name": "Ambush at Sorinor", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["German DOS Edition", "US DOS 3.5\" Disk edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2926966.png", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "videogamegenre": ["Real Time Strategy"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Mindcraft Software, Inc."], "videogamefranchise": ["The Magic Candle"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS"], "usersrated": "1", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Mindcraft Software, Inc."], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2926966_t.png", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>In Ambush at Sorinor, Mindcraft's follow-up to its 1992 game, Siege, players work as mercenary commanders, taking missions from six warring factions in order to make a profit.

It is a racing game involving remote control cars and utilizes an out-of-vehicle perspective.<br/><br/>Story<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of the game is to win the Nintendo Championship cup. This is accomplished by spelling the word NINTENDO three times. Along the way, the player can pick up weapons and power-up items.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>NINTENDO<br/><br/>Each track has a letter the player must drive over to receive, which is always the next letter needed of NINTENDO. For instance, if a player didn't pick up the letter &quot;N&quot; in Track One, the letter &quot;N&quot; would be on Track Two. A player is expected, although not required, to pick up a letter in each track. The first two times NINTENDO is spelled, the player is awarded a faster and better car. The third time NINTENDO is spelled, the player beats the game.<br/><br/>Vehicles<br/><br/>There are three vehicles in the game that the player receives as he or she progresses through the game. Each successive vehicle has better acceleration and handling than the previous one. The player cannot choose which car to use. The AI vehicles are always the same as the player's, progressing along with it.<br/><br/>Upgrades<br/><br/>The vehicle has three parts that can be upgraded. The battery boosts acceleration; the motor boosts speed; and the tires improve handling. Upgrades are received by driving over one of the parts on the track, and each track has a part to capture. The upgrades become active when the player starts the next race, and they do not carry over when the player receives a new vehicle.<br/><br/>A view of your vehicle detailing the level of part upgrades precedes every race.<br/><br/>Weapons<br/><br/>Players have a choice of two weapons to use on the track. Bombs eject from the back of the car, while missiles shoot from the front in a straight line. The player cannot have both items at the same time and can switch by picking up their respective items on the track. Weapons can only be fired when the player has ammo, which are star-shaped items on the track.<br/><br/>Track items<br/><br/>The track also consists of multiple hazards. Hazards include oil slicks, sand pits, and traffic cones. Players can also pick up roll cages, which makes the driver invulnerable to crashes and other hazards.

The mechanics and level designs of the Royal Palace rooms are directly lifted from Bomb Jack. Action zones can be split up into several portions, and contain power-ups usually hidden in treasure chests such as money bags, Mighty Coins and Mighty Drinks. Mighty Coins allow Jack to change colors; blue allows Jack to open orange treasure chests, orange allows him to open any treasure chest by simply touching it from the side, and green transforms all enemies on the screen into coins for 5 seconds. Mighty Drinks add 10 seconds to the game's timer. Secret passages can also be found in the action zones, activated by finding a Sphinx in a visible or hidden treasure chest.<br/><br/>To prevent the player from becoming too &quot;greedy&quot;, the game automatically sends the player to a Torture Room if they obtain more than 9 Mighty Coins or 99 seconds on the game's timer. The only way to escape a Torture Room without losing a life is to complete a number of jumps, which are counted down on the screen. Once the player exits the torture room, Jack automatically loses all Mighty Coins, the timer is reset to 60 seconds, and the game recommences from the beginning of the current level.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Mighty Bombjack&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80328": {"poll": [], "name": "Big Bang Mini", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA DS release"], "average": "7.3", "videogametheme": ["Other"], "usersrated": "5", "videogamedeveloper": ["Arkedo Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo DS"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SouthPeak Games"], "description": "From the game box:<br/><br/>Blast your way through this fast-paced shoot 'em up that delivers a new spin on classic arcade game-play!

It is the third installment in the Warlords Battlecry series and the sequel to Warlords Battlecry II.<br/><br/>While Warlords Battlecry III is primarily a real-time strategy game, it has some elements of role-playing in that players can complete optional quests, as well as create a customized Hero character that can level up from battle to battle and equip unique and powerful items.<br/><br/>The Campaign is a mixture of an overhead strategic map with real-time gameplay. Departing from the system used in Warlords Battlecry II, which consisted of a Risk-style board with territories, Warlords Battlecry III divides the world of Etheria into numerous locations (mostly cities) that players travel between, with various events at each. Almost all of the map locations have missions to play, some of which are not readily visible until other missions have been completed, as well as shops, academies, and/or mercenaries for hire. Once a player enters a mission, the game switches to real-time strategy gameplay reminiscent of games such as Warcraft and Age of Empires. Players use four resources, Gold, Metal, Crystal and Stone, which are used to produce a variety of structures and units. Unlike many other RTS games, resources are present as neutral buildings which can be captured and destroyed (not permanently) and generate resources automatically without player input. Although magic and spells come into play, games are usually decided by the player who has a combination of an overwhelming number of superior units and better micromanaging of his Hero character. The Hero typically becomes extremely powerful by late game and can slay tens of normal units alone.<br/><br/>Warlords Battlecry III is unique in its replay ability due to the diplomacy system and the number of races in the game. Depending on which missions have been completed and what was their original race selection, players can be Enemies, Neutral, Friendly, or Allied (which makes that race playable) with each of the 16 races. Preprogrammed biases explained in the backstory mean that it is more difficult for a player to be allied with two warring races, such as Dwarves and Plaguelords, but it is possible.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Warlords Battlecry III&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80355": {"videogame": ["Cossacks Anthology"], "poll": [], "name": "Cossacks: Back to War", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["GE Win Release"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1064918.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Cossacks"], "videogametheme": ["Historical"], "usersrated": "7", "videogameexpansion": ["Cossacks: European Wars"], "videogamedeveloper": ["GSC Game World"], "videogamegenre": ["Real Time Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "6.88286", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["cdv Software Entertainment"], "videogamecompilation": ["Cossacks Anthology"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1064918_t.jpg", "description": "Back to War is the second expansion pack, but it can be played as a standalone.

At the end of the Scene the Protagonist and Allies roll Fable dice to make the outcome of the Scene a success. But be warned! The Antagonist will thwart Ambitions, abuse Talents and play up Limitations using the dreaded Foil dice. Will the Protagonist and his Allies prevail over their antagonistic rival?

For many years, the three Gods are content as they help to shape the world around them. But one by one, they all began to believe that they should rule over the others. What started as talks quickly became battles and so began the war.<br/><br/>For thousands of years, the new races fought in the name of their creators until most of those suited for war had fallen. All of the races and the gods saw extinction on the horizon and called for a truce.<br/><br/>A few millennia have pasted since the end of the second war. The descendants of the gods are very different now. Instead of being comprised of a single God, they have all started to assimilate into one another. They now share traits of all three Gods. They no longer wish to conquer the world for a single God, instead they wish to conquer it for themselves. Thus began the Third War. The creatures of the world now battle each other in petty battles over land, resources or dominance.<br/><br/>"}, "80385": {"poll": [], "name": "Josefin Skolhj\u00e4lp: L\u00e4r att L\u00e4sa", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Swedish Win/Mac edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Josefin Skolhj\u00e4lp"], "videogametheme": ["Children's"], "videogamegenre": ["Educational"], "videogamedeveloper": ["KREA Medie"], "videogamefranchise": ["Josefine & Pixeline"], "videogameplatform": ["Macintosh", "Windows"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["PAN Vision"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Pedagogical game for school children.

Battle at Bull Run is a simulation of historical events of July 21, 1861 intended to give a feeling for the historical decisions required by the two army commanders in a fast play format.<br/><br/>* Two-Person or Solitaire Play<br/>    * Color Five-Page Game Rules Manual<br/>    * Upgraded Game Map In Full Color<br/>    * Larger Game Map Now 15 x 11 Hexes<br/>    * 25 Upgraded 3/4&quot; Counters<br/>    * Two Union Units Added To Order of Battle<br/>    * Solitaire Play Rules<br/>    * Available in PDF Format<br/><br/>"}, "80426": {"poll": [], "name": "Task Force 1942", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["German DOS Edition", "North American DOS edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2922809.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Military", "War - World War II"], "usersrated": "3", "videogamedeveloper": ["MicroProse"], "videogamegenre": ["Real Time Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS"], "average": "8", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["MicroProse"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2922809_t.jpg", "description": "Task Force 1942: Surface Naval Action in the South Pacific is a DOS PC game, released by MPS Labs (MicroProse) in 1992.<br/><br/>The game is a surface naval simulation which allows the player to operate single ships or a task force made up of ships, from the United States Navy (USN), Royal Australian Navy (RAN) and Royal New-Zealand Navy (RNZN), or the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) in the South Pacific during WWII.

It runs on Namco Pac-Land hardware but with a video system like that used in Dragon Buster. It is also the first game from Namco to allow 2 players to play simultaneously. The game was later released on the Famicom (brought to the American NES by Sunsoft), and both this version and the original arcade version were later released on Nintendo's Virtual Console service.<br/><br/>Sky Kid is a two-dimensional, scrolling shooter game. The players play as the Sky Kids &quot;Red Baron&quot; and &quot;Blue Max&quot;, which are references to Manfred von Richthofen, the famous World War I flying ace, and the prestigious order Pour le M&eacute;rite, informally known as Blue Max. The Sky Kids fly around in biplanes  and are assigned specific targets during the missions. These missions involve bombing specific targets. The &quot;A&quot; button is used to control the plane's machine gun and the &quot;B&quot; button is used to perform a loop.<br/><br/>A number of obstacles face the player in each level. First, their biplane is not equipped with a bomb to complete their mission, and must be picked up en route to the target. Second, there are both ground and air units that attempt to keep the Sky Kids from accomplishing their mission. Last, the Sky Kids may have to navigate through some very inhospitable terrain or navigate around cities in order to get to the target. The targets that the Sky Kids must bomb will either be a fortress complex or a ship. As the player moves farther up in the 9 missions, multiple targets will begin to appear in the course of one mission. Players receive points for destroying air and ground targets, receiving additional points for how many of these types of targets are destroyed. In addition, players get points based on how much of the target is destroyed.<br/><br/>Sometimes blowing up enemy units will reveal a hidden Namco icon or character, including Pac-Man, Inky, the Special Flag from Rally-X (which has appeared in many other Namco games) or Pooka from Dig Dug.<br/><br/>If the player does a loop in front of girls, the girls send out hearts representing kisses.

With the death of Gustav Stresemann on October 3, 1929 and the crash of the American Stock Exchange, Germany's recovery from the devastating Great War now is in doubt. Communist, Fascist and Republican forces clash over ideology and erupt into a war of words and violence. Unemployment begins to spiral out of control while the German people grow restless. Rallies are held by charismatic leaders as lawmakers struggle to find answers. Amongst the chaos, a new figure will head the German nation.<br/><br/>Weimar: German Politics 1929-1933 is a two-player political game that tries to simulate the chaos of Germany prior to Hitler's appointment to chancellor. Will you take the role of the Social Democratic leadership, staving off the extreme ideologies of Communism and Fascism? Using your political influence and paramilitary forces, will you try to gain control of the Reichstag, or send Germany to the brink of anarchy? Can you change history, or is Germany doomed to repeat it?<br/><br/>Weimar is a block/CDG in which one side plays the SPD and the other plays the NSDAP. A third Communist force is played by both players. Players hold rallies, street fights, build alliances, and try to win the hearts and minds of the German people.<br/><br/>Victory can be achieved in multiple ways, with both parties being able to gain influence in each electoral area and score them in each election phase. Influence is gained by holding rallies and bringing political and paramilitary forces to both &quot;encourage&quot; and intimidate the German people. Alternatively for the Nazis, they can use events to increase chaos and unrest in order to bring down the weak parliamentary government. For the SPD, they can use special actions to stop the Nazi political machine, including the elimination of its leadership.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "5.5", "name": "Weimar:  German Politics 1929-1933", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Area Movement"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Block wargames", "Cities: Weimar", "Country: Germany", "Political: Elections"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The Messy Game Room Episode 17"]}, "80447": {"boardgamedesigner": ["ErikPeter Walker"], "poll": [], "name": "Cogsburg", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Co-operative Play", "Pick-up and Deliver"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic823845_t.jpg", "average": "3.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unpublished)", "(Web published)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic823845.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Print and Play first edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Print & Play", "Puzzle"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Designer Summary:<br/><br/>For ages, the studious inhabitants of Cogsburg lived without fear, happily ticking along as they went about their business.

Mega Man Anniversary Collection contains the first eight games in the original Mega Man series, which debuted on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) with the first six games, moved to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) with the seventh game, and then moved again to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn with the eighth game. The plot follows the robotic protagonist Mega Man in his continuing adventures battling the evil Dr. Wily and his army of Robot Masters.<br/><br/>Each game has a nearly identical gameplay structure in which the player traverses a series of themed stages to face off against boss robots, gain new weapons and abilities, then defeat Dr. Wily in a final confrontation. An extra feature is the &quot;Navi Mode&quot; for the first six titles, which provides hints and pathways for completing each stage. In addition to these eight games, Mega Man Anniversary Collection includes two unlockable fighting games (Mega Man: The Power Battle and Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters), which were both previously unreleased outside of Japan. These two titles are similar in gameplay but a bit more streamlined. The battles cut straight to the bosses, who get progressively more difficult with each one defeated.
