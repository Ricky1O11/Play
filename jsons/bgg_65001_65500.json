The advice is independent of a particular system or setting. Advice is given on group handling, preparation, and execution of an adventure. Also, there is a thorough guide to building an entertaining story for the particular group. The book is inspired by knowledge from The Forge and incorporates tips from indie games.<br/><br/>From the back of the German book:<br/><br/>Spielleiter. Keine andere Funktion in einer Rollenspiel-Runde ist so unbeliebt. Die damit verbundene Arbeit bleibt oft nur an einer einzigen Person aus einer Spielrunde h&auml;ngen. Dabei ist die Aufgabe mindestens ebenso spannend und &uuml;berraschend wie das &Uuml;bernehmen einer Spielfigur.<br/><br/>Beim Vergleich von Spielleitern f&auml;llt auf, dass Einige die Aufgabe besser erf&uuml;llen als Andere - das Ger&uuml;cht, dass man zum Leiten geboren sein muss, h&auml;lt sich daher hartn&auml;ckig. Dieses Buch will damit aufr&auml;umen und gibt Anf&auml;ngern und fortgeschrittenen Spielleitern eine Anleitung, die in Regelwerken von Rollenspielen leider meist zu kurz kommt: Welche Aufgaben hat ein Spielleiter &uuml;berhaupt? Wie bereitet man sich vor? Kann man Improvisieren lernen?<br/><br/>Zu diesen und anderen Fragen werden detaillierte Antworten und Anleitungen gegeben. Dabei steht immer das Spielvergn&uuml;gen im Vordergrund: Rollenspiel soll Spa&szlig; machen und nicht in Arbeit ausarten.<br/>Auch f&uuml;r den Spielleiter.<br/><br/>from the back of the English book<br/><br/>Gamemastering. No other task is as unpopular in a roleplaying group. Very often, it is the gamemaster who ends up doing all the work so everyone can enjoy the game. But the job of gamemaster is at least as exciting and unpredictable as taking on the role of a player character.<br/><br/>When comparing gamemasters, it becomes obvious that some are better at their task than others - which is why rumors that one has to be &quot;born to be a gamemaster&quot; stubbornly persist. This book does away with this preconception and provides both beginning and experienced gamemasters with instructions that are usually neglected in roleplaying game books. How to tailor the game to the group? How to prepare a game in no time? Can one learn to improvise? How to create and structure adventures?<br/><br/>These and other questions are answered in a detailed manner including directions, exercises, and examples. Enjoyment always comes first - roleplaying is supposed to be fun and not turn into too much work. <br/>Not even for the gamemaster.<br/><br/>"}, "65002": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Dragon (Issue 136 - Aug 1988)", "rpgproducer": {"17134": "Mike Cook"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic643097.jpg", "usersrated": "4", "average": "7", "rpgissue": {"1221": "Dragon"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"36148": "\"Damage control - report!\""}, "rpg": {"191": "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (1st Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"18938": "Softcover Magazine"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic643097_t.jpg", "description": "Dragon Magazine<br/>Vol. XIII, No. 3<br/>Issue #136<br/>August 1988<br/><br/>&quot;Urban Adventures: An orc in a dungeon is a foe.

These mountain goblins are larger, huskier, and more aggressive than their smaller cousins who plague the bamboo forests, hills, and farms of the southern low lands.<br/><br/>Historically, the dai-bakemono were a war-torn race, with warring fiefdoms and clans battling across the northern-most mountains. In recent centuries, though, the dai-bakemono have begun to ape their southern neighbors; the ascendancy of samurai culture and the rise to power of the daimyo have made a significant impression on the mountain goblins&rsquo; society.<br/><br/>Dai-bakemono are tough humanoids with a martial spirit. An aggressive species, they respect strength and power, and naturally align themselves into groups and ranks.  They are surprisingly adaptive; while they seem to lack a true understanding of bushido, they have adopted much of the discipline of the samurai with whom they frequently fight. As a result, the dai-bakemono have developed a sense of honor and duty; assassinations and backstabbing as a means of advancement have become rare, and their ranks are eerily well organized by competency.<br/><br/>While the dai-bakemono have kept more-or-less to themselves in years past, with clan warfare dominating most of their time, their recent adoption of bushido (or at least their corrupted understanding thereof) has resulted in increased interest in the civilized portions of the Land of the Crane.  Several powerful warlords have emerged, each claiming the title of daimyo, and there appears to be a rivalry for the title (or concept) of the dai-bakemono shogun.<br/><br/>"}, "65120": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Forward Pass", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1919", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"5640": "Sports: American Football / Gridiron"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic644483_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"6990": {"name": "Smith Kline French"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic644483.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"201295": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1038": {"name": "Sports"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Forward Pass from Smith, Kline &amp; French Co.

A Battle Born trooper wears special powered armor called an &quot;EE&quot; Suit, which is so effective it can destroy just about anything, except someone else in an EE Suit.

Leech wyrms are foul dragons whose habits are more reminiscent of the undead, than the fire breathing habits of the greater dragons of legend and lore. With vampiric lust they haunt quiet dungeons and forgotten pathways, waiting for a warm, ichorous meal to come within their grasp. Whether through hollow fangs or barbed tongues they drain the blood of their victims. From the brutally violent Maegle Wyrm that grinds its prey to pulp or the far gentler Iris Dragon that paralyzes and feeds upon its victim for days, these dragons are creatures from our uncertain nightmares.<br/><br/>Each dragon entry is accompanied by a short one piece adventure for a total of 8 short adventures.<br/><br/>Meet the Wierling, a new racial class for play or NPC. The weirlings, or Dragon Riders, are the last of the Aathuk that carry the desires of their ancestors. These are the curious few who take to the skies and travel the world or beyond.  They are rare, but bold and brave adventurers. Wealth and power do not generally motivate the weirling; rather they yearn to be free, and to follow the paths laid down, but abandoned by their ancestors. Anything that removes them from the opulent silk laden beds and perfumed dormitories of their people draws their attention. The weirling longs to drink from the cup of life, and to suffer its indignities as well as its triumphs.<br/><br/>Also revealed are the peculiar origins of kobolds and their binding with the Talmut dragons. Meet the dragons and the Bone Guard that ride them. Expand your campaign to the heavens and bring kobolds to the table like never before!<br/><br/>Inside the covers of Leech Wyrms are 8 new dragons, more dragon specific magic items, campaign information and more. Also included within is the new racial class, the Wierling: the Dragons Riders; and the Peculiar Tale of the Kobold.<br/><br/>Dragons of Aihrde: Leech Wyrms is not campaign specific, but integrates easily with any ongoing home brew campaign.

Players who made their bid exactly, score 10 points plus a bonus of the number of tricks taken squared.

(IPH). It&rsquo;s a low-to-intermediate complexity, strategic/operational-level, alternative history wargame of the campaign that could've resulted had the Japanese decided to launch an amphibious invasion of Oahu at the same time as their historic air raid. The game is intended for two players, one commanding the Japanese and the other commanding the US forces. The game system is focused so as to present the ground-commanders&rsquo; views of the campaign. Aero-naval operations &ndash; though certainly important in play &ndash; are presented more abstractly than would be the case in a design centered on those aspects of the campaign.<br/><br/>Each hex on the 34x22 large-hex map equals one mile (1.62 km) from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents about four hours of daylight or an entire night. Playing pieces (176 iconic counters) represent ground units of approximately company size, or individual aircraft carriers or battleships, or enough aircraft sorties (about two to three dozen) needed to affect battlefield events at this scale. The rules contain a little less than 11,000 words. Two experienced players can finish a match in less than four hours.<br/><br/>The single counterfactual assumption underlying the game is Adm. Yamamoto decided to back the plan he scrapped historically in September 1941. That plan had called for an amphibious invasion, conducted by about two regiments, to land on Oahu at the same time as the air attacks were begun. The further supposition then is, the Japanese, once ashore, would&rsquo;ve had no more than about three days in which to achieve their now more ambitious goal: either secure the whole island or at least fight their way across enough of it &ndash; while thoroughly wrecking facilities as they came to them &ndash; to ensure the American recovery would be delayed as long as possible. The three-day limit is due to the fact that, by the end of that period, the Japanese carrier strike group would had to have withdrawn and the ground force&rsquo;s initial load of combat supply would be used up.<br/><br/>Rules cover such things as: variable landing sites, rough surf, carrier interventions, combat ground support, interdiction, a Nisei uprising, Ford Island and Battleship Row, night combat, banzai attacks and much more. The turn sequence is as follows.<br/><br/>I. Carrier Warfare Phase (only Game Turns 5 &amp; 9)<br/>A. Ship Disposition Segment<br/>B. Carrier Combat Segment<br/>II. US Submarine Attack Phase (only Game Turns 5 through 11)<br/>III. Japanese Landing Phase<br/>IV. US Sub-Command Chit-Pull Phase*<br/>V. US Sub-Command Chit-Pull Phase*<br/>VI.

Instead of winning by competing with other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game. Players take turns moving their pawns around the 'island', which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles before play begins. As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made.<br/><br/>What causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game. It comes in a sturdy and organized tin of good shelf storage size. The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted and they fit just right into the box. The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image.<br/><br/>With multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from (each with a special ability of their own), many optional island formats and game variations available, Forbidden Island has huge replay value. The game can be played by as few as two players and up to four (though it can accommodate five). More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though the extra help can make all the difference. This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age. Selling for under twenty dollars, oddly, Forbidden Island is a rare game of both quality and affordable price.<br/> For those who enjoy Forbidden Island, a follow-up project by Gamewright titled Forbidden Desert was released in 2013.<br/><br/>From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>Dare to discover Forbidden Island! Join a team of fearless adventurers on a do-or-die mission to capture four sacred treasures from the ruins of this perilous paradise. Your team will have to work together and make some pulse-pounding maneuvers, as the island will sink beneath every step!

There are two sets of cards; large cards that show full drawings, and smaller cards that show individual parts of the full drawings. Each full drawing on a large card consists of three main parts. Therefor there are three small cards for each large card.<br/><br/>Both sets of cards are put face down on the playing area. You can choose to mix the large and small cards together in one group, or to have them as two separate groups.<br/><br/>In a turn a player first flips over one of the large cards which will show a full drawing. For example: A bird in a nest on a branch. Then the player flips over a small card, trying to match it with the full drawing on the large card that's already flipped over. In the example mentioned, a matching small card should show a drawing of either the bird, the nest or the branch.<br/><br/>If no match is made, both the large and small cards are to be flipped over again, face down. If a match is made, the player gets to keep only the small card; the large card has to be flipped over again. However, if the matching small card is the last of the small cards remaining for the specific large card, then the player gets to keep both cards.<br/><br/>A player is allowed another turn whenever he/she is able to collect a small tile. If a player collects both a large and a small card, it's the next players' turn.<br/><br/>Should a player overlook the fact that the collected small card was the last one of the set remaining, and flip over the large card so that it is facing down again instead of collecting it, then any player in his/her own turn can still collect this large card. A player doing so has to mention that the large card he/she collects does not have any of its small cards remaining. Collecting a single large card also means that it's the next players' turn.<br/>A player that overlooks to collect a large card does however get another turn since he/she did collect a small card. He/she can still use this extra turn to collect the large card, so other players are warned not to rejoice openly to quickly as this might trigger him/her to do just that!<br/><br/>If a player collects a large card, the remaining large cards have to be shuffled.<br/>Whenever a single player manages to collect a full set of cards (1 large card and its 3 small cards), all remaining cards (large and small) have to be shuffled.<br/><br/>The game ends when there are no more cards to be collected. To determine the winner, the cards are counted and scored as follows:<br/><br/><br/>     1 point for each small card<br/>     2 points for each large card (except for the last collected large card; No points for that!)<br/>     3 bonus points for each complete set of cards (1 large card and its 3 small cards)<br/><br/><br/>The player that gets the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"217625": "Prototype edition"}, "name": "Pick-A-Part", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2047": "Memory"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4665": "Children's Games"}, "age": "5"}, "65291": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "JAG-GER The Strategy Jigsaw Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic978998_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4590": {"name": "Paraphrase, Inc."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic978998.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1028": {"name": "Puzzle"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>&quot;JAG-GER is the first true family game in years.

In this game the computer hacker sees the world around him as a computer system, not some simulated city or countryside. The characters log into the matrix through a Cyberdeck (which is a computer) that controls how they appear, how strong their attributes are, and what kind of programs they can use.<br/><br/>Leveling in this game is how the characters earn money, which they in turn use to buy upgrades and become stronger. They can also earn money through missions (usually to steal information from Datastores).<br/><br/>The matrix consists of computer systems, each with its own address. Usually at the beginning of a mission the character is given the address of a system to hack and the knowledge of what they're looking for. The GM constructs this system ahead of time plus the Artificial Intelligence (AI) programs that guard it. These computer systems consist of Nodes. Each Node connects to another and each has specific tasks. Most Nodes have a rating, which determines who hard it is to use or pass through them. They also have AI guarding them that the character will have to fool or battle. Failing to do these things can trigger alarms that alert the owners of these systems. Then things get harder as the employed hackers from those systems login to try and discover the cause of the alarm.<br/><br/>This game actually does have a &quot;happy ending&quot; for the characters. Upon reaching level 10 the characters can retire.

Japanese players must select the timing, direction, and composition of the attack in order to inflict enough damage to prevent the US Pacific Fleet from interfering with future Japanese war plans in Southeast Asia.&quot;<br/><br/>The game map is an abstracted depiction of the battle area divided into four quadrants, allowing for simultaneous games to be played in each quadrant by different groups of players. The areas depicted on the map are divided into concentric zones - Ford Island, Pearl Harbor, Oahu, and the Pacific Ocean. The map also specifies the position of naval installations, airfields, and anti-aircraft batteries.<br/><br/>"}, "65376": {"rpgitemversion": {"19207": "Softcover"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Jesienna Gaw\u0119da", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic854849.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "rpgsetting": {"272": "Warhammer World"}, "average": "8", "rpgissuearticle": {"31521": "Jesienna Gaw\u0119da"}, "rpggenre": {"156": "Fantasy (Low Fantasy)"}, "rpg": {"275": "Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (1st Edition)"}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2139": "Non-Game Book (but RPG Related)"}, "rpgseries": {"8375": "Almanachy"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic854849_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>&quot;Jubileuszowa publikacja z okazji 10lecia Wydawnictwa Portal, Jesienna gaw\u0119da jest zbiorem artyku\u0142&oacute;w Ignacego Trzewiczka publikowanych w Magii i Mieczu oraz w magazynie Portal.

The game takes place in the 18th and 19th centuries, when Kokkola was one of the most significant maritime towns in Finland and a major export hub, especially of tar and timber - essential commodities for the large navies of the major European powers of the time.<br/><br/>In the beginning each player has a small ship which can carry one unit of cargo (initially, tar). Cargoes have a fixed buying price and profit depends on which port they are sold in. Each port provides 1 or 2 types of cargo, roughly historical - London wants tar and timber, provides luxuries and salt - and by trading in this way, players try to amass the biggest fortune before the cargoes run out.<br/><br/>Each round a player can sell or buy cargo and buy a bigger ship (carries 2 units) or cannon, which protects from pirates. Movement is by dice rolling, and before sailing a player takes a 'sea-card' with varying results - a pilot who helps in reaching the next port, pirates who steal the cargo, favourable or adverse winds or a special price event. The latter are also historical, such as the unrest following the French Revolution causing increased demand for grain in Amsterdam, or events of the Crimean War.<br/><br/>When the last cargo is bought, the game ends and the player with most money wins.<br/><br/>"}, "65405": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic648497.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"34434": {"name": "J\u00fcrgen Adams"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2004", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"27900": "Neuland ID"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2764": {"name": "Kraul"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic648497_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "description": "Each player controles a group of artists and<br/>attempts to make a performence in a circus.<br/>Before thye get there, they must gather enought practice. <br/>On their path, the players can decide where to go by playing cards from thier hand. <br/>Depending on the location, different artists have different probability to improve thier skills.

The dragons, fabulous creatures, are asleep and each of them dreams a creature ; but at the same time, all of them dream the world. When a creature dies, his dragon awakes, but as the creature is also dreamt by the other dragons, its body remains.<br/><br/>This is a metaphor of the role-playing game itself : when players gather to play, they imagine - dream - together an adventure, and each player imagines his own character.<br/><br/>As well as different stories often interfere (e.g. a player plays different games in the same week), the different dreams (worlds, universe) can interfere; there are rips between them, and the character can go to a different world sometimes without noticing it! Strange creatures can also come to the present dream.<br/><br/>Just like a sleeper has only partial control over his dreams, why would we have nightmares otherwise ? the dragons do not completely control their creatures and worlds. The dreamed creatures have the possibility to modify the dream (the world) itself ; this is the source of magic, highdreaming.<br/><br/>The life of a character is fuzzy between the game sessions ; the player only has little ideas of what happens to his creature. In the same way, characters of R&ecirc;ve de Dragon sometimes experience a gris-r&ecirc;ve (greydreaming): they suddenly realise that they are somewhere with companions, but only have limited memories of what happened the days before. But what happened can be the key of the current situation...<br/><br/>When a character dies, his dragon wakes up and then falls asleep again ; at the same time, the character wakes up in a new dream, a new life. This means that the character is recreated with the same abilities, but a different past, a different job, different skills, a different name. The player thus plays the same character again. well, not exactly the same : the character is not a newborn, he is already adult, just coming from another dream.<br/><br/>The &quot;sum&quot; of all these incarnations are the archetype of the character. When the character is himself sleeping, he can remember his past incarnations, and thus learn skills he never practiced nor studied. These memories of a past life can also be the key of the adventure...&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;R\u00eave_de_Dragon,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "65462": {"boardgamedesigner": {"33743": {"name": "Heike Pfeifle"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Cut!", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2004": "Set Collection"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic648893_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"772": {"name": "(Unpublished)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic648893.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"189941": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The learners are Telecommunications and Film students who have just completed a unit on continuity in films.<br/><br/>Given a Cut! deck, the learner will be able to distinguish between shots taken from either side of a scene (see Figure 1: The axis of interaction) by sequencing the shots represented on the cards in Cut! without interrupting the continuity of the sequence.

The object of the game is to take control of the city by means of assassination or economic sabotage. There are many different paths toward achieving this goal, so look carefully at all of your options.<br/><br/>Your goal is to obtain as many assets as you can and wipe out all the other gangs in town. The assets that are available to you are hitmen, dealers, muscle, and businesses. Be ruthless on your way to the top.<br/><br/>HITMEN are used to take out the other assets in the game, as well as enemy bosses. Their fees can be steep, but this is the mark of an expert assassin. Used wisely, hitmen will quickly take the title of your most useful asset.<br/><br/>DEALERS are an easy way to make money in this city. Everyone needs something, and these shady assets are there to supply it to them for a nominal fee. Owning dealers will make you money each turn.<br/><br/>MUSCLE are your strong men, used in a variety of situations. They are your personal bodyguards and can be sent out to any assets you deem in need of some protection. They can also hassle businesses into giving up protection fees, making them invaluable.<br/><br/>BUSINESSES are the most legitimate, and therefore least cost efficient, way of making money. Businesses are in general the most expensive assets in the game, but they are especially helpful because they cannot be targeted by hitmen.<br/><br/>These are the resources at your disposal. If you can use them correctly nothing will stand in your way. But always be on your guard; you're not the only one willing to do what it takes.<br/><br/>Get some friends together and become enemies.

Everyone is allowed to enter Democracy Falls, even Judges...<br/><br/>...the only problem is getting back out again.<br/><br/>Democracy Falls is a scenario for the Judge Dredd: Traveller game setting, placing several Judges in a dangerous and foreign city in the Cursed Earth, where fast cars and faster bullets are normally the Law of the land.<br/><br/>"}, "65494": {"boardgamedesigner": {"32622": {"name": "Sharon Jones"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Decades", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2004": "Set Collection"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic662625_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"772": {"name": "(Unpublished)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic662625.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"190062": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The players will be able to identify key figures, events and trends in the United States during the 20th Century and recognize their place within specific decades and the century itself.
