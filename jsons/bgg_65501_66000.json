Many citizens cannot even fend for themselves, and must live in sprawling facilities tended by robot caretakers. The virus mutated quickly, and now passes from mother to child. Everyone is infected. There is no cure. But some are spared....<br/><br/>Players take the roles of Immunes, those one-in-a-million Tetra-League citizens who are unaffected by the Pacification Virus.

A Battle Born trooper wears special powered armor called an &quot;EE&quot; Suit, which is so effective it can destroy just about anything, except someone else in an EE Suit. This gives rise to a problem - soldiers that want to survive must learn to use their armor in ways that go beyond the suit&rsquo;s design....<br/><br/>This book includes sections on character generation, skills and equipment, advancement, psionics, starships, ship-to-ship combat, introductory encounters, background material for the Era Ten campaign setting, and optional &quot;Quick-and-Dirty&quot; systems designed to make running mass-combat planetary actions and orbital assaults easier and more enjoyable. Rules expansions and additional material can be found in the Guardians of Sol RPG, the pages of Space Gamer Magazine, and on Better Games' Web site.<br/><br/>Battle Born can be played alone, or as a supplement to enhance any Sci-Fi game system.<br/><br/>"}, "65606": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Gypo Logging Board Game", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2005", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic735027_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic735027.jpg", "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Economic", "Environmental"], "age": "13", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "This is a roll-and-move game in the style of Monopoly.

The set contains 100 cards (90 photos, 6 jokers, 4 blancs), 4 cards with suggestions for words, 1 booklet with rules and examples.<br/>The principal mechanism is very simple: You form compounds by combining the words that you associate with two or more photos. A photo doesn&rsquo;t represent only one word. For instance, for the photo that shows an eagle you can also say &quot;bird&quot;, or &quot;beak&quot;, or &quot;head&quot;, or &quot;feather&quot;, or &quot;claw&quot;, or &quot;animal&quot; and so on. Thus, in combination with other cards in the set, you can form numerous words such as &quot;bird bath&quot;, &quot;bird table&quot;, &quot;frigate bird&quot;, &quot;game bird&quot;, &quot;pack animal&quot;, &quot;stuffed animal&quot;, &quot;animal farm&quot;, &quot;animal world&quot; and so on.<br/>The games can be played on all language levels. The selection of the photos ensures that you can form a large number of compounds within the range of basic vocabulary. Also, you can extend the linguistic range deliberately in terms of code, style and special languages.<br/>In educational contexts the games cannot only be used for vocabulary training. It is also possible to train more subtle competences such as abstract thinking (eagle &gt; bird &gt; animal), the perception of paralleles and differences (bird: bird of prey vs. singing bird), style and narrating (you put down one card after another and let narrate / narrate yourself).<br/>You can play most of the games either in competition or in coordination. Some of the games you can even play on your own. Depending on which game is played, the emphasis is on speed, concentration, memory, or wit. All the games are a challenge to imagination.<br/>The games are suited for cross-generational, highly communicative playing within the family. They have also been designed for educational and therapeutical purposes.

Each player should take a blank Home Buyer's contract. Each player will need a pen or pencil to record results on their home buyer's contract.<br/>   2. Select one Home Profile from the set of Home Profile cards. Each player will use the same home profile as a starting part for their home contract.<br/>   3. Each player then uses a pencil to fill out their home-buyer's contract with the information from the home profile card.<br/>   4.

The player on the right of the current player draws a task card from the draw box and asks the current player the question on the outside of the card.<br/>   6. If the current player requests a hint, the player on the right opens the card and reads the hint (usually a set of multiple choice answers).<br/>   7. The number of spaces a player may move is stated on each task card and depends on whether the current player got the answer right and whether a hint was used.

Players select cards with varying powers of cashflow, victory points, and poverty penalties, and compete to manage them most efficiently.<br/><br/>&quot;London lies devastated after the Great Fire of 1666. This is your opportunity to build a new city on the ashes of the old. It is up to you how you employ the talents of the people of London to this end. Will you favour the business classes, who will earn you money? Or would you prefer to spend more money than you can rightly afford on grand monuments and sumptuous palaces? You must also deal with the problem of rising poverty and how to employ the many paupers of the city. Throughout the game you will be forced to make tough decisions. To achieve one aim you must sacrifice another, which may open an opportunity for a competitor.&quot;<br/><br/>Nearly 250 years of progress is glimpsed in this game. Famous buildings and monuments of the era as well as engineering developments such as streetlights are illustrated on the cards.<br/><br/>The publisher calls London &quot;a relatively simple game that can be played easily within ninety minutes.&quot;<br/><br/>Description below is quoted from Kris Hall's BGN interview with Martin Wallace:<br/><a target='_blank' href='http://www.boardgamenews.com/index.php/boardgamenews/comments/kris_hall_the_martin_wallace_2010_preview_interview' rel='nofollow'>http://www.boardgamenews.com/index.php/boardgamenews/comment...</a> <br/>(Note: Some elements of the game described below have changed as shown in the final rulebook available online)<br/><br/>As with a lot of games, London is about scoring the most VPs.  Players manage their hand, selecting cards to play into their building display by laying them out in a line.  At some point a player will choose to run his city. They can activate their buildings in whatever order they prefer.  The resulting actions can generate money and VPs, reduce poverty or have some other effect specified on the card.

It is rare, but not unheard of, to see it played outside of these environs.<br/><br/>It is traditionally played by 4 people, three players and one dealer. Cards are divided into two suits - informal and formal characters numbered from 1-10 and one &quot;Phoenix&quot; or joker card. There are 4 duplicates of each, with the 2's, 7's and 10's of both suits picked out in red (which are worth extra points when scoring).

With Gettysburg Wallace wanted to produce a balanced rather than a historically accurate game. The game e.g. ignores casualty levels, and Units do not correspond exactly to brigades or divisions - even if the forces' proportion is close to historical accuracy.<br/><br/>The player pieces in Gettysburg are similar to those in Treefrog's previous wargame, Waterloo. Each day consists of four periods, and the game is played over three days, and key locations must be held by the end of one period.  Each player has eight numbered 'order blocks', ranking from two to five.  Players then place such blocks in the game areas, the order block allowing a number of orders to be issued that area.  The orders can activate units in the same or adjacent areas.  Orders are represented by discs, once the number of order discs in an area matches the value of the order block then no more orders can be issued.  The players will then have to remove the block and place a new one. If a player does not have enough order discs for the following period, he will be forced to pass for each disc he is short.  Assault combat is similar to Waterloo, the main exceptions are that the attacker and defender use different morale check tables. The defender is more likely to retreat than be eliminated, but there is also the chance of a counter-attack to throw back the assaulting forces. The Confederate player wins by taking two starred areas, or Little Round Top.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "7.27264", "name": "Gettysburg", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Dice Rolling"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "265", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Treefrog Line"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Heavy Cardboard Episode 39 \u2013 Top 50 Favorite Games of Right Now", "I've Been Diced! episode 39: Martin Wallace"]}, "65826": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic654463.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jason C.

This is a game of Privateers vs. Spanish Galleons.  The Galleons, one carrying the Treasure, are attempting to deliver it to their home port while the Privateers are attempting to capture the gold.  All ships have equal speed, strength and vulnerability.<br/><br/>The game is based around the map, which shows wind direction in each diamond as well as ports, forts (gray areas with letters and gold triangles), calm areas (diamonds containing blue sea serpents), sandbars(yellow diamonds), dry land (gray diamonds), ice flows (icebergs in the diamond) and coral reefs (orange diamonds).  The ships move around the map based on the wind direction and are really only limited to changes in wind direction and decisions to change ship direction.  Chance only comes into play when you move on to a calm area, the teetotum is then used to determine whether the wind comes up.<br/><br/>A ship is given 6 wooden beads at the beginning of the game to represent its strength.  Loss of beads due to difficult maneuvers, combat or running aground can lead to &quot;disablement&quot; which takes away some of the ability to change directions during your turn.  A second disablement (loss of 4 beads) means the ship can only move 1 square a turn.<br/><br/>In Combat Privateers shoot on the N/S/E/W lines (diagonals) and the Galleons shoot NE/NW/SE/SW down the rows.  Each ship can fire up to 2 space away and Combat includes the concept of Leeway, drifting on the tide as combat occurs, leading to some chance as a players ship may run aground or collide with another.  Ships can be boarded and even attacked by the forts shown on the map.<br/><br/>This is a game of maneuver where advanced planning is key and the effects of tide and wind drive the game.<br/><br/>An outstanding example of Naval Miniatures play from the 1930s.<br/><br/>"}, "65844": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Bill Rolette"], "statistics": [], "name": "Culture Shock", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1998", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2427882_t.jpg", "average": "6", "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2427882.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "poll": [], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Game of world travel and culture for 2 to 4 players ages 12 to adult.

The Core Rulebook features an extensive Table of Contents which has been bookmarked for ease of use, an in-depth index, black and white and color artwork and all the rules and information you need to get started playing.<br/><br/>The Phaethos Role Playing Game is a fantasy RPG from Simian Circle LLC. The game takes place in the world of Phaethos which is basically a mash up of Fantasy and Western genres. Phaethos is heavily influenced by the impact cartoons in the 1980s U.S. had on me when I was growing up. While the game does not reflect these influences directly in all cases, these influences have contributed to many ideas and concepts that exist in Phaethos.<br/><br/>Like most RPGs, the Phaethos RPG is all about imagination, excitement, entertainment and fun. It is designed around a core set of rules that expand outward allowing for players and GMs to expand the game as they see fit. The core rules are given as guidelines, with examples (like Kore Magic Spells) which can be used to expand the game as needed. Phaethos offers players and GMs the ability to freely create spells, abilities, items and pretty much anything else they can think of.<br/><br/>Phaethos utilizes a d10 dice pool where participants roll and take the highest number and compare it with a Target Number or against an Opposed Roll. All conflict resolution in the game is handled in this way whether it be Skills, Abilities, Combat, Social Combat, Attributes checks, Magic, Psionics etc.<br/><br/>Phaethos offers 12 starting class templates which reflect the area of training the character has at the time of creation. These templates are starting guides for the players and allow them to begin with a better than average set of skills and abilities. As the game progresses, players may choose to build their characters as they see fit. In a nutshell, Phaethos utilizes class templates to start and then allows players the complete freedom of upgrading their characters however they see fit.<br/><br/>Experience Points in Phaethos are used to show character progression. There are multitudes of ways in which characters can gain XP; accomplishing a task, rolling dice, using teamwork, defeating an enemy or solving a puzzle etc. Experience can then be used to purchase upgrades for the characters as the players see fit. Character upgrades can be anything from a new ability to weapon proficiencies to health upgrades. This system works well in allowing players to create classless characters that don't have to conform to a rigid template. However, if a player wishes to play a rigid character class, say for instance Thief, that is an option also.<br/><br/>While everyone who has ever played an RPG finds battles and combat to be loads of fun (and this is a main feature of the Phaethos RPG) there are often other aspects in a game that go overlooked. One such aspect the Phaethos RPG Core Rulebook covers is social interactions and combat between player character and non-player characters. Phaethos has an in-depth Social Combat system which utilizes a character's Skills, Attributes and guile to interact in the world of Phaethos. The Social Combat system allows players to actually argue and debate to gain bonuses as they role play their characters. For players who like rolling dice, the Social Combat system accommodates this as well.<br/><br/>You don't have to be a math wiz to play Phaethos. The d10 dice pool makes the game intuitive and fun to play. The openness of the system and its expandability is designed to allow those who enjoy the game to create their own additions and supplements for the game. Finally, Phaethos is designed to be both crunchy and rules light depending on who is playing. You can go by every rule in the book or simply use the core rules as a guideline by which to have adventures in the world of Phaethos.<br/><br/>"}, "65885": {"rpgdesigner": ["Dirk Stanley"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Book of Beasties Volume I", "rpgartist": ["Dirk Stanley"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic989027.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy", "History (American West)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Simian Circle Games"], "rpg": ["Phaethos"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic989027_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>The Phaethos RPG Book of Beasties Volume I is an expansion book for the Phaethos RPG.

Roberts Best World War 2 Era Board Wargame Nominee"], "description": "The Blitzkrieg Legend simulates Case Yellow, the German offensive in May of 1940 that shocked the world. In less than a month's time it made quick work of Belgium and Holland, shattered the armies of France, and pushed the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) into the sea at Dunkirk. This twelfth game in the Operational Combat Series (OCS) game from Multi-Man Publishing and departs from its established norms in using a ground scale of 3 miles per hex and a time scale of two-day turns, and as such is similar to Sicily. The chosen scale lets this lightning campaign unfold a bit more slowly, and gives the densely-packed armies more room to maneuver.<br/><br/>Case Yellow achieved the largest pocket ever to be created in the war, with the largest number of captured soldiers as well. This result is sometimes looked upon by gamers and historians alike as a foregone conclusion, but Manstein's daring strike through the Ardennes was a gamble that might easily have gone awry. Hindsight suggests the fighting could have gone much differently.<br/><br/>A range of historical problems confront the player directing the Allies in this game. His French, Belgian, Dutch, and BEF combat units have not yet mastered the faster pace of action in WWII, and therefore are slow and don't fight at full Action Rating when in Move Mode. The Allies are also forced to adopt the historical Dyle Plan (when not playing the what-if version of the campaign), which leaves the French with inadequate reserves behind the Ardennes and too many of their best forces committed to shielding Antwerp and Brussels. Because history tells us the headlong rush into Belgium was primary cause of the quick Allied defeat, an &quot;If I Was in Charge...&quot; version of the campaign is presented to allow both sides to explore some different initial deployments.<br/><br/>A simple set of campaign objectives are presented, with Victory Point awards centered on the following:<br/><br/>&bull; The French must vigilantly protect Paris, which is the ultimate German objective. Two more cities along the map's south edge, Verdun and Metz, are also worth points (so the French cannot just abandon the Maginot Line).<br/><br/>&bull; The possible surrender of Holland is triggered by German armor moving adjacent to any of the three Dutch major cities. Surrender chances are modified if the French and BEF are supporting Holland (which is why French 7th Army initially moved north of Antwerp).<br/><br/>&bull; The possible surrender of Belgium and BEF Evacuation are triggered when the Germans drive a wedge between the Belgian coast and Paris. Surrender chances are modified, however, if the French and BEF are supporting Belgium (another nod toward the historical rationale of the Dyle Plan).<br/><br/>&bull; The Germans also win points for battering the BEF, so the Allies are encouraged to keep this force intact.<br/><br/>The game's special rules are judiciously chosen to evoke the full flavor of the campaign. For instance, the Maginot Line is given its historical due, shown as a strong right shield that can unfortunately be outflanked through the Ardennes. Rules for special operations are something new to OCS, and these can capture enemy bridges and forts (but just on 10 May unless playing an optional rule). As mentioned above, the BEF can get isolated or mauled as part of the victory conditions, and if this happens a ragtag assemblage rides to the rescue: RN Destroyers, special Evacuation Ports, elite Irish and Welsh battalions, and even some Spitfires finally appear to provide some top-cover. Mix in the occasional Pause &mdash; an event that tugs sharply on the panzers' leash &mdash; and you've the kind of chrome that make The Blitzkrieg Legend a tremendous tool for historical study and an exciting source of gaming  pleasure.<br/><br/>The Blitzkrieg Legend is also a game with tremendous replay value. Presented are 7 scenarios and 3 campaigns. The longest is just 13 turns; the largest fits on a standard 4' x 6' table.  Series veterans know the depth of the model can lead to some long and complex turns, but here at last we have an entire campaign that can easily be played to the finish!<br/><br/>Scenarios<br/><br/>1. South.  The first 4 turns on the southern half of Map B. Covers the fighting at Sedan as well as the crossings of the Meuse further downstream by 6th and 8th Panzer.<br/>   2. Center. The first 4 turns on the northern half of Map B. Covers the fighting at Gembloux Gap as well as the crossings of the Meuse by 5th and 7th Panzer.<br/>   3. North. The first 4 turns on Map C. Covers the air landings and surrender of Holland.<br/>   4. Mini-Campaign. Links the first three scenarios into a short campaign using two maps.<br/>   5. Sedan. Lasts just 2 turns and uses just a small portion of Map B. Covers the French counterattack and German breakout.<br/>   6. Arras. Lasts just 1 player turn. A teaching scenario covering the Allied counterattack.<br/>   7. Dynamo. Lasts 8 turns.
