Goals can keep changing, though, so you never know for sure how to win.<br/><br/>In Batman Fluxx, crime is running amok and no one can win with Villains on the table, so put on your utility belts and leap into the fray to help Batman and his friends clean things up!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "average": "6.43512", "name": "Batman Fluxx", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Set Collection"], "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": ["Fluxx Dice"], "usersrated": "504", "boardgamefamily": ["Comics: DC Universe", "Fluxx"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The Party Gamecast Reviews - Batman Fluxx from Looney Labs"]}, "178211": {"boardgamedesigner": ["\u2191\u3082\u3064\u306a\u3079\u592a\u90ce\u2190 (Ue Motunabetarou Hidari)"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Serpents", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2530623_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["\u2191\u3082\u3064\u306a\u3079\u592a\u90ce\u2190 (Ue Motunabetarou Hidari)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Paragraph Jump"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2530623.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Japanese first edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Animals", "Racing"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "User summary:<br/>Serpents is a strategic race game with almost no luck involved. Its theme is the struggle for survival among 7 varieties of serpents. The game is played with 2-4 players.<br/><br/>Each player takes a postcard-sized game board that depicts a winding serpent. The serpent is divided into 26 segments, each with a number ranging from 1 to 3 (some segments have a special effect: Attack or Guard). Each player places their three tokens on three segments from the tail. The goal is to take all of the three tokens to the serpent's head.<br/><br/>Each turn, each player add up the numbers where their three tokens are on, and simultaneously advance one of their token segments equal to that total. If the token lands on an Attack segment, each opponent must move all of their own tokens 1 segment backward, unless they had just advanced a token to a Guard segment.<br/><br/>Players interact with each other by Attacking/Guarding, and each serpent has its own special ability. Each turn, each player has limited options, and they are known to all players. So players' decisions and interactions will determine the winner.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>\u30b5\u30fc\u30da\u30f3\u30c4\u306f2\uff5e4\u4eba\u7528\u306e\u7570\u306a\u308b7\u7a2e\u306e\u30d8\u30d3\u3067\u751f\u5b58\u7af6\u4e89\u3092\u884c\u3046\u3001\u904b\u306e\u8981\u7d20\u304c\u307b\u307c\u7121\u3044\u6226\u7565\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3059\u3002<br/>\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306f\u7570\u306a\u308b\u30d8\u30d3\u306e\u30b3\u30ed\u30cb\u30fc\u3068\u306a\u308a\uff13\u3064\u306e\u30b3\u30de\u306e\u30de\u30b9\u76ee\u306b\u66f8\u304b\u308c\u3066\u5c45\u308b\u6570\u5b57\u306e\u5408\u8a08\u3092\uff11\u3064\u306e\u30b3\u30de\u306e\u79fb\u52d5\u529b\u3068\u3057\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u3081\u3056\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u30de\u30b9\u76ee\u306b\u306f\u653b\u6483\u3084\u30ac\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u30de\u30fc\u30af\u3082\u3042\u308a\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u9593\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30e9\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u767a\u751f\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u307e\u305f\u5404\u30d8\u30d3\u306f\u305d\u308c\u305e\u308c\u56fa\u6709\u306e\u80fd\u529b\u3092\u6301\u3061\u3001\u3053\u308c\u3089\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u306e\u898b\u6975\u3081\u304c\u91cd\u8981\u3068\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u6700\u3082\u65e9\u304f3\u3064\u306e\u30b3\u30de\u5168\u3066\u3092\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u3055\u305b\u305f\u8005\u304c\u52dd\u8005\u3068\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/><br/>"}, "178212": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Daniel A.

Religion deceives with light but good things are all available by secular ways. Delusion, oppression flow from religion. Missionaries collect money and convert people.

City, country, and playground - because some religions like to use children for their purposes. Values are depending on the religion&rsquo;s nature and popularity in the area.<br/><br/>You start the game on the first level. By collecting enough money you level-up your religion in greed. By successfully finishing a mission you level-up your religion in spirituality. On player's board numbers show bonus points or penalties valid at that level. That value influences the collected money and the power to convert as well.<br/><br/>Four kinds of levels are to go through from white to red. With different colors new action cards and mission cards become available. Level-up by money becomes more expensive. You have five cards in the game, action and mission cards mixed.

These first robots went to work in factories, mines and the fields of large, corporate owned farms, displacing human laborers. Then military models, with improved AI and more complex chassis emerged. Then, when the first POETICA hit the market, refinements to the Tetsujin operating system to make their personalities more well rounded and naturalistic emerged.

It&rsquo;s also the only magical school in the southern hemisphere. The buildings may look like a concrete 1970s tragedy, and the administration may desperately cling to European traditions in order to create some fac\u0327ade of respectability, but the real treasure of Swinemole&rsquo;s is its burnt out, bitter staff, and its appalling and apathetic students.<br/><br/>Firstly, the staff can&rsquo;t be bothered to teach. Why would they when you have petty staffroom politics to keep you busy? Fighting over temporary positions, stationary and classroom furniture is what keeps the wheel of magical academia turning. Staff, like students, will be a member of one of the four houses (Phlegm, Blood, Gall, Bile) and assigned to a faculty (constantly changing, possibly meaningless). There&rsquo;s also a lot of pointless paperwork and potentially fatal workplace hazards for the unwary educator at Swinemole&rsquo;s, so keep sharp and trust no one.<br/><br/>Secondly, the students are indulged, indolent and incompetent. Why try when you have connections? Bad grades can always be fixed by mummy wielding a killing curse in the front office. So students wisely use their time to create the social hierarchies that will hopefully serve them for a lifetime. Fatness curses, love potions and endangered animal sacrifices are the bread and butter of magical teens in a magical school; just make sure you get to the end of the school year in one piece.<br/><br/>So as you wantonly grasp for power, prestige and/or potions, keep in mind the proud and mostly legal traditions of Swinemole&rsquo;s, and disregard the school&rsquo;s insipid motto &ldquo;si post fata venit gloria non propero&quot; (or if you prefer English) &ldquo;If glory comes after death, I can wait&rdquo;.<br/><br/>"}, "178299": {"poll": [], "name": "Jupiter Jump", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android Edition", "iPhone/iPad Edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Space"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Noodlecake Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Noodlecake Studios"], "description": "Being propelled from the force of your crashed ship, all you can do is tap to increase your gravity and slam down to the surface.

Separate the deck into 3 decks, the draw deck A/2/3/4, the Market Deck 5/6/7/8/9 and the board set up 10/Jokers/J/Q/K. Set up all KQJ10s in four rows of same suits placing Jokers on the tens and randomly draw four face up cards from the market deck below the tens. KQs are the Royal Council and the Jacks separate the council from the marketplace. The draw deck is where you legally earn money by drawing cards, the market deck gets drawn into the marketplace when cards are reserved or purchased. Purchase cards with cards of the same color.<br/><br/>When cards are discarded or spent they go face up into the appropriate decks discard section where market cards become the black market and draw cards become heists. To do illegal actions such as purchasing from the Black Market or perform a heist you must bribe a face card by placing a card higher than previous card of the same suit on the card taking lower bribe into your hand. Anyone can bribe a Jack but you must pay off a Royal for there loyalty. Pay off Queens first which cost 25 Of its suit minus the Jack bribe, same for king but also minus the Queen bribe, place a player marker on Royal. Royal bribes are always scored as end points but the game ends and scores differently in ways of play.<br/><br/>There are 3 different variants of Corrotto: Ladies First, Hot Potato and Rat Race.<br/><br/>"}, "178338": {"poll": [], "name": "Random Heroes 3", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android edition", "iPhone/iPad edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Aliens"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Ravenous Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Platform", "Run-and-gun"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Noodlecake Studios"], "description": "Alien scum are invading earth one last time!

Precious because of its life prolonging radiations in its processed state. Contact with Raw Aix however caused severe ageing and deformation of all living tissue. The Galactic Empire dominated by the evil Ardands used humanoids to mine Aix from over 2000 mines ... Slaves were &quot;worthless&quot; a humanoid miner had a life expectancy of 5 days by which time  is body was no longer useful for any other purpose.<br/><br/>To supply its Aix mines with sufficient slaves The Empire imposed the &quot;Quota-Law&quot; ... All humanoid inhabited planets had to produce slaves for the mines of face termination. This law served a two fold purpose for The Empire, its Aix mines were supplied with all the slaves required and the subject world's population was kept depleted of its youth and hence any fires of rebellion. Failure to comply with the &quot;Quota-Law&quot; resulted in an Empire Deathstar being despatched to obliterate the defiant world, with its weaponry, or by pushing it into its own sun with a tractor beam.<br/><br/>The year is 4021. The Earth has refused to give up any more of its people to be slaughtered in The Empire's Aix mines! The Galactic Empire's Deathstar approached Earth's defences, prepare to meet its onslaught. However Earth's Defence Council knows no planet's defences can ever hope to defeat a Deathstar. Earth has only one hope.<br/><br/>The Deathstar is known to have one weakness, the central reactor providing its power located deep within its defences of forcefields, laser turrets and fighter craft. If a single Earth fighter can penetrate its defences and score a direct it on the reactor's exhaust port the reactor will go nova taking the entire Deathstar with it!<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>Death Star Interceptor is heavily influenced by the Atari vector graphics Star Wars arcade machine, but played from a third person perspective. The Star Wars influences in the Spectrum version extend to the name and design of the &quot;Deathstar&quot;, the X-Wing style player sprite, the TIE-Fighter style ships the player must shoot down in space and even an officially licensed version of John Williams' famous theme tune! The C64 version uses different designs for the player and enemies.<br/><br/>The gameplay is reminiscent of the arcade game with a few minor differences. The first level, not in the arcade game, has your ship taking off (to a synthesised female voice urging you to &quot;Prepare to Launch!&quot;). The aim is to fly your ship accurately into a &quot;Stargate&quot; to launch into space. The second level is reminiscent of the space stage on the original arcade machine where waves of TIE Fighters assault your ship, but plays more like a Galaxians-style shooter. The enemy ships must be shot or avoided while the Deathstar grows ominously in the top left of the screen. There is no equivalent of the Death Star surface run from the arcade machine. The third stage goes straight to the Trench Run, where the player must avoid obstacles, shoot or avoid weapon emplacements and ultimately shoot at the Exhaust Port to destroy the Deathstar.<br/><br/>The player has three lives, but also 5 shields for each life, so can be hit quite a lot of times.<br/><br/>"}, "178367": {"poll": [], "name": "Majestic Nights", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows/Macintosh/Linux Downloadable Edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2534448.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Detective / Mystery"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Epiphany Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure", "RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Linux", "Macintosh", "Windows"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Epiphany Games"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2534448_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>You are a wetwork detective caught up in a world confused between crime and government conspiracy.

Think of it as 3D connect 5 on gogo juice! And, unlike all its predecessors, and most strategy games of today, Stack'Em 5 allows for more than 2 players at a time. That being said, it is an incredibly strategic battle for 2 players, however as many as 7 can enjoy it, but with 8 or more we wont take responsibility for what might happen next. You and your family &amp; friends will find a new meaning of competitiveness, making Monopoly Night look like a calm night! It's extremely simple to learn for even the youngest gamer, but will take years to master its strategies, making it challenging for the veteran player as well.<br/><br/>Strategy 101: Every single move counts in the which players try to achieve 5 in-a-row, ball by ball! The fundamental rules take less than a minute to learn, yet the game has the complexity to engage both beginners and experts alike - perfect for the entire family!<br/><br/>Stack 'Em 5 Rules!<br/><br/>Each player chooses a color and takes a set of balls. Players take turns stacking balls on the board, the first player starts by placing his/her first ball within the 9 center rods, after which point play is open to any of the 49 rods. Each and every ball is stacked strategically so that 5-in-a-row is accomplished vertically, horizontally, or diagonally just so long as it forms a straight line from point to point with NO turns. Easy Right! The rotation of play is counter-clockwise with a time limit of 30 seconds per turn,  keeping you on your toes. The board itself spins completely around, either left or right on the center rod, giving the current player the ability to look at all the different angles. Only the current player may move the board, and he/she may do so as mush as they like, until the end of their turn. Once a ball is stacked, it cannot be removed or placed elsewhere, and the players turn is over. There are no restrictions on how balls of different colors are stacked. You may put a ball on any of the 49 rods that are open. Once 7 balls occupy a rod, that rod is full, giving the players a total of 343 possible positions on the board. The goal is to simply block your opponent from getting 5-in-a-row while strategically placing your balls to do just that. Be tactical. Obstruct your opponent(s) while expanding your own &ldquo;territory&rdquo;. The game ends when a player has been able to link 5-in-a-row in any way possible.<br/><br/>"}, "178399": {"rpgdesigner": ["Amanda Hamon", "Jonathan H.

If you are playing Pathfinder with the mythic rules, you need to grab this book.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, this book is an amazing resource for you even if you&rsquo;re NOT using the mythic rules!  The mythic rules are a terrific toolbox for making magic more mysterious and, even better, more interesting, in a standard Pathfinder campaign. From ancient cultures to secret cults, alien races to eldritch secrets, sacrificial sorcery to divine mysteries, all are sources from which the forgotten or forbidden lore of mythic magic could spring to new life in your Pathfinder campaign.<br/><br/>The Mythic Spell Compendium includes over 2000 mythic spells, including every spell from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook, Pathfinder Roleplaying Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide, Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Race Guide, Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Combat, and Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Magic, as well as hundreds more spells from official Pathfinder products designed for the campaign setting and companion books. If they were not already published in Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Mythic Adventures, you&rsquo;ll find them here. All of them. It also includes hundreds more spells from some of the leading 3rd-party publishers for Pathfinder, including over 700 spells from Deep Magic by Kobold Press and over 100 spells from the Gothic Campaign Compendium and other products from Legendary Games.<br/><br/>"}, "178400": {"rpgartist": ["Ralph Horsley"], "rpgitemversion": ["Hardcover", "PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Mythic Hero's Handbook", "rpgdesigner": ["Jason Nelson"], "rpgproducer": ["Matthew Goodall", "Jeremy Miller", "Alistair Rigg", "Owen K.C.

You'll find options galore to suit any character build and inspiration for new heroic directions to take on your path to immortality, whether your character is a holy hierophant or treacherous trickster, an indomitable champion or inventive genius, a steadfast guardian of others or a steely-eyed stranger ready to launch a roaring rampage of revenge!<br/><br/>These rules elements can be incorporated into a traditional Pathfinder Roleplaying Game campaign as well as one using the full mythic rules!

Every page is illuminated with unique evocative art. Barriers are shattered as adjacent mythologies are explored in conjunction with the Norse myths. This offers a new and unique view into what these mighty explorers may have faced as they raided and traded with their neighbours. The Illuminated Edda contains&hellip;<br/><br/>&bull; All 35 poems found in traditional Poetic Eddas<br/><br/>&bull; The Prose Edda (Gylfaginning and Skaldskaparmal)<br/><br/>&bull; Rare works such as Heidrek the Wise<br/><br/>&bull; Select stories from the Celtic myths (Lebor Gabala)<br/><br/>&bull; Handpicked stories from the Welsh myths (Mabinogion)<br/><br/>&bull; Select stories from the Finnish epic The Kalevala<br/><br/>&bull; Handpicked stories from the Baltic myths<br/><br/>&bull; Select stories from the Inuit myths<br/><br/>&bull; Bonus sagas that come from the imaginative mind of Andrew Valkauskas<br/><br/>&bull; An extensive glossary of characters, magical items and places<br/><br/>&bull; A simple story telling game using the Futhark runes<br/><br/>&bull; Beautiful and inspiring artwork from talented artists to enhance and delight your senses.<br/><br/>Come and discover the genuine history of the Vikings, from the mind of the author who has researched and made Viking history his passion for the last 25 years.<br/><br/>YouTube Video: <a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcHzN67loA0' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcHzN67loA0</a><br/><br/>&quot;Andrew Valkauskas and his talented team of artists have produced a truly remarkable and encyclopedic mythological compendium. Filling in the gaps in the surviving record with Valkauskas' own imaginative understanding of Viking Age mythology and providing supple and powerful retellings of traditional myth, along with parallel myths from other European cultures, this book gives vivid life to a lost thought-world that yet still resonates with us today.&quot;- Dr. Carolyne Larrington (Professor in Medieval English Literature, Oxford)<br/><br/>&quot;THE ILLUMINATED EDDA is one of the most beautiful books I have ever had the pleasure to read. Couple this welcoming, sink-into-the-book presentation with the clarity and accessibility of the author's translation, and you've got the essential reference. This opens the door for the layperson to experience the root lore and enjoy the Eddas as saga. Bravo! This should delight librarians (like me), fantasy lovers (like me), gamers (like me), and just plain readers (like me), and should be in every school where English is used.

First, the book presents several new classes specifically for animal companions, allowing you to choose what type of animal companion you want: from the ferocious fearsome beast, to the implacable stalwart sentinel. Those looking for a less combat-inclined animal companion might look to the sage counselor&mdash;which responds particularly well to its handler&rsquo;s magic&mdash;or the sly varmint, which allows the animal companion to serve the utility role of a rogue, to a lesser extent. The noble steed is perfect for paladins and cavaliers, and the spirit guide reinforces a cleric or inquisitor&rsquo;s zeal and moral views.<br/><br/>Beyond this, there are a wide variety of new feats and spells that feature animal companions, including several feats made specifically for animals, and a collection of teamwork feats for animal companions and their handlers, helping the two to fight in sync. Finally, a brief section discusses some of the common pitfalls and difficulties of roleplaying an animal companion, and some ways to combat them.<br/><br/>Your animal companion deserves to be just as special and customized as the character that it comes with.

At the end of his turn, he throws down one card on the upturned pile.<br/>Tracey Trouble card can be acted upon when the player wishes to steal unprotected pairs ie: if one is picked from the pile, he may act upon it immediately or keep it until it is of more use.<br/>Johnny Condom cards can be used whenever a player wants to protect his pairs whether he picks one up or is dealt one. To protect a pair he must place a Johnny Condom card on top of that pair.<br/>Right Brian Bummer cards are good for nothing and are there as a joker card - mainly to hold up the game.<br/>5When all the pairs are out and the only cards still circulating are Tracey&rsquo;s, Johnny&rsquo;s or Right Brian&rsquo;s, then each player adds up his score and the player with the highest number is the winner.<br/><br/>Amusing Note: According to the back of the box there are cards called 'Right Brain Bummer', i.e. no good, but in the components they have changed to 'Right Brian Bummer'.

The main differences between the use of tables in Perilous Journeys and their use in older RPGs is an emphasis on exploration and discovery over combat encounters, and the baked-in methodology of using randomized results as prompts rather than facts, to be interpreted during play.<br/><br/>The collaborative map-making guidelines and all of the tables are system-neutral (usable with any RPG rules). Although the tables are structured to tie directly into the rewritten travel moves, they can be used in any game in which a fantastical landscape is explored. &nbsp;<br/><br/>The new follower rules are written by Jeremy Strandberg, and are intended to give NPC hirelings more substance without a significant increase in bookkeeping. I like Jeremy's modifications so much now that I can't go back to the original Dungeon World hireling rules.

If you're familiar with Funnel World, one of my previous projects, you might call this Advanced Funnel World. It&rsquo;s a 32-page, digest-size book, content-complete and currently in playtesting with my weekly game group. The PCs&mdash;comprised of the classic four classes of Fighter, Thief, Cleric, and Magic-User&mdash;plunder the wilderness for treasure, with the goal of stashing enough away to one day retire. Character generation is mostly randomized (down to name and appearance), and the fatality rate is high; survival is the name of the game. Arcane and divine magic are volatile, and their effects are subject to structured negotiation. For instance, arcane spells are generated using a Vancian spell name table that holds the potential for more than a million different spells, and it&rsquo;s up to the player and GM to decide what each spell does in play according to its name. The three spells the Magic-User had in a recent playtest session were &quot;Barbaheer's Ingenious Wings,&quot; &quot;Enveloping Hammer,&quot; and &quot;Munnohulik's Entangling Aether.&quot;<br/> <br/>From the Designer:<br/><br/>Freebooters is a &quot;hack&quot; of Dungeon World, using the same basic ruleset as DW but modified to suit the &quot;treasure-hunting in the wilderness&quot; theme. It depends on knowledge of Dungeon World, and on the exploration mechanics in Perilous Journeys. For example, rules for character creation, 4 playbooks, an equipment list, and a comprehensive set of moves are included, but it uses the DW rules for monsters, so no rules for monsters are included.<br/><br/>Release date: Sept. 2015<br/><br/>"}, "178073": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Fog and Garden Giants", "rpgdesigner": ["Alex Riggs", "Joshua Zaback"], "rpgproducer": ["Rosa Gibbons"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2528142.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Necromancers of the Northwest"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Weekly Wonders"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2528142_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>These Giants Aren&rsquo;t So Jolly<br/><br/>These days, it seems that there is a giant for every type of terrain.

The first is the fog giant (CR 13), are secretive, reclusive giants that hide in mists and haze, using it to instill fear in their foes, to protect them in battle, and even taking its form when it suits them. The second is the garden giant (CR 10), a peaceful, if xenophobic, race of green-skinned, nature-loving giants who place the safety of their carefully-cultivated plants above the lives of those who might trespass in their domain.

Players take on the roles of fleet admirals in battles ranging from the American War of Independence to the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812. Each fleet has access to different ships, tactics, and command personalities - each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Offering a unique blend of detail and simplicity, the scenarios included enable the recreation of historic actions or 'what-if' scenarios.<br/><br/>The rules are designed for 1/1200 scale ship miniatures, although they can be easily adjusted for smaller scales. Game focus is on ships of 6th Rate or above. The game is hex-less, so uses movement and turning templates along with a tape measure or ruler.  Combat and other tests utilize a pool of six-sided dice.<br/><br/>Fighting Sail was designed with a crew-centric approach and has a goal of immersion over simulation. To perform actions players roll a number of dice based on crew and ship capability to test against a target number.  More successes return a better result (more movement, more hits in combat, more damage saves, etc.). The goal of the game is to break the enemy fleet by reducing their morale to zero.  Morale can be lost by taking damage, suffering a collision, or when a ship is taken out of action (by striking, being sunk, or captured in a boarding action).<br/><br/>The Fighting Sail rules include a points-based system for building fleets and balancing scenarios.  The ship/crew capabilities and special rules for eight fleets are detailed in the book (including privateers and pirates).
