We will lend what support and allies as we can. Find the knowledge we seek and be rewarded...<br/><br/>Odin Quest is a solitaire game of Myths and Omens with artwork by Todd Sanders on 90 tarot sized playing cards which plays in about an hour of time.<br/><br/>Needed to play:<br/>90 game cards &bull; 1 player marker &bull; 7 six-sided dice<br/>13 black, 12 red, 12 yellow, 1 white and 1 blue cubes used as tokens<br/><br/>Setup:<br/>Separate the 7 decks of cards into separate marked decks: Ward, Event, Ally, Foe, Conflict, Realms and your Action cards.<br/><br/>Deal the 9 Realms + Valh&ouml;ll in a ring, face up.<br/><br/>Shuffle the Ward, Event, Ally, Foe and Conflict decks, placing them below the Realms as draw piles. Draw and place, face down, a number of cards as directed by the icons and dots on the Realm cards above the Realms in a stack.<br/><br/>Phases of Play:<br/>1. Explore: From your current Realm you may move one Realm either clockwise or counter clockwise. You may also move to the Asbr&uacute; card (if this side is currently face up), rotating Asbr&uacute; so the top of the card is aligned with your current Realm. You may then cross the ring to the card opposite to the bottom of the Asbr&uacute; card. After doing so, flip the Asbr&uacute; card to the Mimisbrunnr side.<br/><br/>At the new Realm, turn over any face down cards which are above it in order, one by one. Put any Foe cards that Events have had you place in this or another Realm on top of the stack of cards.<br/><br/>There are two types of Realms in Odin Quest:  <br/>Light Realms, where you will find Allies <br/>Dark Realms where you will find Foes<br/><br/>At each Realm you may also encounter Events or find Wards. Occasionally new Foes will be placed on Realms you have already visited.<br/><br/>2. Encounter: At the occupied Realm you will encounter the stack of cards above that Realm. Turn each over one by one and encounter each separately. Any previously active Foes at this Realm will be encountered first, then the rest of the card stack.<br/><br/>When Encountering Events - Follow the directions on the card. Most Events usually add Omen Tokens - Doom, Fear or Greed to the Event or to neighboring cards.<br/><br/>When Encountering Foes - At each Realm, if a Foe or Foes is encountered, draw one Conflict card. This card is used for all Foes in the Realm and will give each Foe a base value for the encounter as well as a Special Action which overrides other rule texts. Next, roll 7 dice, placing them in numerical order from low to high and adding their specified values to the base value for that Foe. This will be the Foe&rsquo;s Encounter Value.<br/><br/>You may now play Action Cards, Allies and Wards from your hand with some restrictions. Once you have played your combination of cards, roll the dice as shown on your Action cards, and on any Ally or Ward cards, adding together the total for your Encounter Value. Your Encounter Value must be higher than the Foe value to succeed in the Encounter.<br/><br/>When Encountering Allies - When encountering an Ally you may only use your Action and Ward cards in the Encounter. Similar rules apply to calculating the Ally Encounter Value and your Encounter value as they did for encountering a Foe. You do not draw a Conflict card when encountering Allies.<br/><br/>3. Resolution: After all encounters are resolved the Realm is considered &ldquo;Cleared&rdquo; if no Foes remain there. This Realm will never have new Foes, Omen tokens or Events placed on it. If a future Event has you placing Omen tokens, skip this Realm. Any Events on this Realm will remain here however as well any current Omen tokens. You may only remove these Omen tokens as your success in the game allows. Turn the Realm 90 degrees in the ring to signal it is cleared. You may move through this Realm during the 1. Explore phase if you so choose.<br/><br/>4. Quest End: The game ends after you have cleared all Nine Realms and defeated all Foes. Valh&ouml;ll, where you began your quest, never needs to be cleared.<br/><br/>If you ever have 2 or fewer Action cards remaining in your hand and discard pile combined OR there are currently more than 18 Omen tokens on the Realms and/or Foes, your quest ends and you have lost.<br/><br/>If you have defeated all Foes and have 3 or more Action cards in your hand and discard pile combined, you have won and may calculate your victory points based on certain conditions.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "Odin Quest", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Press Your Luck"], "average": "6.70833", "usersrated": "12", "age": "10", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["1p 121 - Odin Games (A Feast For Odin)"]}, "193121": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Christian Fiore", "Knut Happel"], "average": "6.39128", "poll": [], "name": "Legends", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Time Track"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "72", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2871721_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Franz Vohwinkel"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2871721.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["German first edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Travel"], "age": "9", "minplaytime": "40", "description": "Four members of the prestigious &quot;Club of Adventurers&quot; in London have made a bet amongst themselves to see who can travel to the eight most legendary places in the world over 75 weeks and learn the most about these places while visiting.

On a turn, a character moves to a location of their choice, spending time to do based on what shows on the game board. At each location, the player can either collect additional knowledge (i.e. cards, with the player collecting cards based on the method showing at the specific location) or discard cards that match this location in order to place a diary token in their color on this space; the more cards they discard, the more points they might possibly earn.<br/><br/>Those points are only possible points because four times during the 75 weeks, the Club members meet again in London to compare their knowledge about the legends, and because time is at a premium, only the five most promising stories can be told.

A mathematical model coupled with a professional course design creates an experience that rivals the real thing. The winning player will be the one whom manages risk v.s. reward and the conditions in the most favorable way.<br/><br/>Doshboardgolf uses a hex-based board to simulate a 9 hole golf course. Players have the choice of 12 directions to shoot from each hex and can even plan for fade and slice!<br/>This course has everything a real course would; straight fairways; water and trees as hazards; elevation changes and even simulated wind conditions.<br/><br/>The game is different every time &ndash; there are 60 different wind settings and 32 different clubs. Four 12-sided dice establish the strategic variability expected with ace runs, doinked putts, roll-aways, out-of-bounds, elevation change, lost clubs, and difficult lies. You will feel the joy of an excellent shot and the defeat of a poor decision. Doshboardgolf is all the strategy of golf on your table.<br/><br/>In Doshboardgolf, each player selects a set of 8 club cards that have differing distance and hook numbers. Players will have all the clubs they need, from the maximum distance driver and mid-range approach club down to the putter which will be used when holing out.<br/>The distance will be determined by rolling a blue die, and the hook determined by the red die only after consulting the players chosen club card.<br/><br/>Using advanced rules, a black die is introduced to simulate roll-aways when you land next to a downhill hex. Also making the game more realistic is elevation changes and penalties when having to shoot out of a hex containing trees.<br/><br/>During a turn, each player in order will:<br/>1. Plan a shot direction using one orange pawn as a directional marker on the board. Players have the ability to execute planned fade and slice to overcome obstructions on the board such as trees, water hazards and elevation changes<br/>2. Select a club card from your 8 available options and place it face up for all players to see<br/>3. Execute the shot by rolling the blue and red dice. After consulting the chosen club card, the blue die determines the distanced travelled, and the red die determines the hook which will happen after the distance is calculated<br/>4. Place your player token in the new lie or if you have successfully holed out, mark your score on the included scorecard<br/>Play continues in this way with the player furthest from the hole always going next.<br/>As in real golf, the player with the lowest score at the end of the 9 hole round is the winner!<br/><br/>"}, "193193": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2956923.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Lukas Litvaj"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "10", "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)", "(Unpublished)"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2956923_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "25", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "description": "Assemble a great army of watchmen &amp; protect the Tree of Destiny.

There it is, the starting signal!<br/><br/>Dashing ahead with your chariot, slowly at first, but quickly gaining speed&hellip; circling the spina in the center of the arena to complete the first lap. The next corner comes closer. Glancing back, one of the chariots is already far behind, and just ahead another chariot's speed is too high for the corner, sending the vehicle crashing into the wall and out of the race. Only a single chariot blocks your path to victory, so it's time to get uncivilized. Steadily you balance the javelin in your hand, waiting for the other charioteer to come into view&hellip;or should you just overtake him and throw caltrops in his path?<br/><br/>In Chariot Race, players participate as charioteers in a great race in ancient Rome. Use the dice to complete two laps on the dusty arena's circuit and be the first to steer your chariot over the finish line. On a player's turn, if they have gained enough Favors of Fortuna, they can repair their chariot. Depending on the chariot's speed on the previous turn and its current condition, the initial speed is determined, which defines how many of the five dice will be rolled during the turn. Each face of the six-sided dice allows a different action: Gain new Favors, increase or decrease speed, change lanes, or attack opponents (either directly by hurling javelins or indirectly by dropping caltrops in their path). if the first roll is not satisfactory, the player may call on Fortuna to influence the dice, as long they have her favor. Once the result is set, the player moves their chariot forward according to the final speed they achieved and may then take actions against their rivals.<br/><br/>However, breakneck racing and ramming are not without risk. If two chariots collide, they both take damage, and cornering at a wild gallop is not recommended. The further the safe speed is exceeded, the more damage is caused to the vehicle &ndash; which might fall apart in the middle of the arena if the driver is too careless, resulting in their elimination from the race.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "French First Edition", "Multilingual first edition", "Spanish/Portuguese First Edition"], "average": "6.07307", "name": "Chariot Race", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "358", "boardgameaccessory": ["Chariot Race: Wooden Meeples"], "boardgamefamily": ["Roll Through the Ages"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["19.

These lethal legends of Latin America range from CR 1 to 30, including such Aztec-inspired creatures as eye-gouging ahuizotl and the apocalyptic harbinger from the stars, the tzitzimitl. From the Mayans we present the beautiful dreamflower xtabay and from Peru the deadly jungle stalker, the tunche. The legends of Chile, from the Araucana to the Chilote and more, bring us the accursed guecubu arisen from its grave with misfortune in its wake, as well as the volcanic cherufe and the shapechanging serpentine peuchen. Classic pulp and fantasy writers like Robert E. Howard have brought us monsters like the hate-fueled zuvembie and the saguaroi catcus-folk, inspired by the myths, legends, and landscapes ofMesoamerica. Creatures of genuine Caribbean legend are also well represented, including the blood-sucking chupacabra from Puerto Rico; the deadly sea monster of the Bahamas, the lusca; and even the very real (though now titanic) giant mantis shrimp! As if a dozen existing monsters were not enough, the brand-new Xipe Totec, a dread demigod flayer of skins and destroyer of destinies. Plus, for your players, the plumed servant prestige class serves the wise and benevolent rainbow-feathered serpents of the jungle pyramids, uniting arcane and divine magic with the subtle weavings of plumes and the watchful gaze of their eternal teachers.

Players are also dealt five Life cards. The space directly in front of a player is their Room, where cards will be played during the course of the game. Slack can be represented using any available chit or counter, but every player begins with a Slack total of zero.<br/><br/>Players take turns as follows:<br/><br/>     Draw Life cards until they have six in hand. (NOTE: Some Jobs vary this to five or seven cards.)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>     Make &quot;variable&quot; rolls. Some Job cards have variable free time or income; their values for this turn are decided in this phase (rolling a 1-3 gives them the first amount; rolling a 4-6 gives them the second). If there are any &quot;uninvited&quot; people in a player's room, he or she may also roll to &quot;get rid of&quot; them (by rolling a 4, 5 or 6) and either send each such person to another room or discard them (if they cannot be played to any other room).<br/><br/><br/><br/>     If any of the player's in-hand Life cards are green Person cards, they may roll to &quot;call&quot; the person to their room. A successful roll (3-6) gets them invited in; otherwise, they are discarded. Some people are &quot;uninvited&quot; (causing bad things to happen), and may be placed without a roll in any player's room. (See above for &quot;getting rid of&quot; these people.) Pet cards, such as Cats (which don't require a roll to enter a room) and Dogs (which may or may not need to be &quot;called&quot;) can also be played in this round.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     For each unit of free time the player's Job card gives them, they may perform one action (play a red Activity card) or go shopping (play any number of blue Thing cards). Some of these cards may have a cost; the total cost for all cards played in a round cannot exceed the income given to them by their Job card. (NOTE: Free Time and Income may be modified by certain Whenever cards played on the player by themselves or other players.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>     At the end of a turn, if a player has more than five cards in hand, the player must discard cards until they have five or fewer. If desired, players can discard all the way down to one card. (NOTE: It is also legal for a player to play ALL the cards in their hand and have NO cards at the end of a turn.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Additionally, some Life cards are orange &quot;Whenever&quot; cards which can be played at any time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Activity cards and Thing cards typically list a Slack value which is added to the player's Slack total, though some have random Slack totals and some have Slack totals which vary during the game. TV Activity cards and some Whenever cards can be used to cancel cards as they are being played, and some cause previously-played cards to be discarded. Some cards add or subtract Slack from every player's total, while others cause a player to change their Job card (and hence Slack goal). Many cards alter the effects of other cards.<br/><br/><br/>The first player whose Slack total equals or exceeds their Slack goal is the winner.<br/><br/>This edition of Chez Geek from Pegasus Spiele includes both the Chez Geek base game and Chez Geek 2: Blockparty &ndash; the Chez Geek sequel from Pegasus that included both of the expansions from Steve Jackson Games: Chez Geek 2: Slack Attack and Chez Geek 3: Block Party.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "5.66667", "name": "Chez Geek 1+2", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Set Collection", "Take That", "Variable Phase Order"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "9", "boardgamefamily": ["Chez Geek"]}, "193339": {"rpgdesigner": ["Frank Schmidt"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Mask of Vexicon", "rpgartist": ["Frank Schmidt"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2876918.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Filbar"], "rpgproducer": ["Frank Schmidt"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["AD&D First Edition (1e) Compatible Products", "AD&D Second Edition (2e) Compatible Products"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "average": "0", "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Adventures in Filbar"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2876918_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Today&rsquo;s Filbar Friday offers continues in the Dual Series with FD8 &ndash; Mask of Vexicon!

Want some evil options for your character? You&rsquo;ve found them!<br/><br/>This book presents five new villainous archetypes for five different classes. Included are the brutal oppressor, a barbarian archetype focused on savagely demoralizing her foes, the elemental defiler, a kineticist archetype that draws elemental energy from places and even living things, harming them in order to gain power, the extortioner, an investigator archetype that uses the secrets he learns to force others to do what he wants, the villainous bloodline for sorcerers, with a variety of special powers suited for a dark lord of magic, and the eldritch slavemaster, a summoner archetype who enslaves the eidolons and creatures he summons against their will, and can sacrifice them for great benefits.<br/><br/>Whether you're about to embark on an evil-themed campaign (such as Way of the Wicked, by Fire Mountain Games, or the first official Paizo adventure path made specifically for evil characters), or you just want an excuse to play an unrepentant, irredeemable villain, this book has lots of tantalizing options to offer.

Success depends on team effort: The effort of your riders driving on into the darkness of night and the chill of dawn. The effort of your pit crew - split second re-fueling, tyre changes and crash repairs all count to your final team placing. Clock up the points during an individual race duel or an full championship season.<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>Endurance is a simulation of a 24 hour motorbike race in which the player is managing a team of two bikes. However the player does not directly control the bikes. Instead orders are issued to the riders of the bikes - to ride conservatively (which might be used to protect a lead, reduce fuel consumption and reduce the chance of actions), normally or as fast as possible (with associated penalties to fuel, tyre-wear, etc.). Choosing when to pit is also important.<br/><br/>Prior to the race, the player selects the engine and chassis characteristics, along with the tyre type. Each of these will have an impact on various aspects of performance in the race (maximum speed, miles per gallon, etc.).<br/><br/>During the race the pit stops are key. When a bike comes into the pits, the player directly controls the pit crew, who must move to the correct part of the bike in order to perform various tasks such as refueling, making repairs, changing tyres and/or brake pads, etc. Pit stops also give the opportunity to switch riders, who each have different characteristics.<br/><br/>Credits:<br/><br/>By G.P.

The aim of the game is to kill the other two Princes and become crowned King.<br/><br/>The Citadel is built around the caldera of a smouldering volcano and is completely circular. Therefore if the player moves in one direction they will ultimately end up where they started. The castle is also built over multiple floors and towers.<br/><br/>The Citadel is depicted at the bottom of the screen silhouetted against the sky. Windows are either lit, showing the colour of the Prince or Men-at-Arms occupying the room. In addition there are King's Guard depicted in Green. Rooms which are unoccupied are black and are therefore invisible against the castle wall.<br/><br/>The screen is split in two vertically. Each player can see the Citadel at the bottom and a view of the room for the character they are currently controlling (their Prince, or one of their Men-at-Arms). Only one character can be controlled at a time. Characters which are currently not being controlled will stay in the room where they were left and will defend themselves if attacked, but not as well as if they were under the control of the player.<br/><br/>Various weapons can be picked up with different strengths and weaknesses. Men-at-Arms can hold one weapon each, whereas the Princes can hold up to three and cycle between them.<br/><br/>Control of two types of room are key to the game. Gate Rooms are links to the outside world from which new Men-at-Arms occasionally enter. They side with the player who last controlled that room. The Throne Room is the ultimate objective. A Prince unopposed in the Throne Room becomes crowned King. At this point the Men-at-Arms of the opposing players become frozen, and in addition the King gains control of the King's Guard. The other players, while on the back foot at this point, still have hope, as killing the King will return the Crown to the Throne Room and return the King's Guard to neutral control.<br/><br/>Credits:<br/><br/>Game Design: Mike Singleton<br/>Programming, Graphics and Music: Consult Computer Systems<br/>Cover Illustration: David Rowe<br/><br/>"}, "193378": {"poll": [], "name": "Grand Prix Racing Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2906424_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Spar"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2906424.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Greek edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Racing"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "2 Fast 4 you!<br/>Fast racing cars ~ public pitstop ~ playing money ~ digital dice &amp; more... 2 to 4 players ~ several levels ~ age 5 to 105 years<br/><br/>Players must collect as much money as they can during the laps of the race (to be agreed by the players, from 5 minimum to 18 maximum).

HIJACK is a skilful combination of arcade, strategy and simulation. The game sets you up in charge of a Pentagon department, the Hijack Division, dedicated to stamping out terrorism by peaceful means.<br/>HIJACK is played using live action and complex windowing techniques as you fight a desperate struggle against bureaucracy to end a hijacking before all hell is let loose.<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>Hijack places the player in the role of the head of an anti-terrorist Hijack Division of the US Government. Terrorists have set a deadline and your job is to defeat them in one of three ways - 1) Raising enough money to pay them off, 2) Raising enough political power to persuade them to give in or 3) Raising a large enough military force to scare them into submission.<br/><br/>This is achieved through working with other members of government. Some are more senior that you, such as the President, others are at the same level as you and others are subordinate. Working to gain their loyalty and respect, and using their different skills is one of the key aspects of the game. Choosing how much time to spend on different activities is also important. For example, the CIA agent can gather intelligence, but a hastily prepared report will only give details of the terrorist demands, while allowing more time for a longer report will give information of potential bargaining tactics and who they are working for. But of course by the time you receive the detailed report, you may not have time to act upon it.<br/><br/>As you gain the confidence of the different members of staff, they may grant you three digit codes which allow additional options to be used. These codes may also be found by examining documents, etc. The ultimate three digit code is provided by the President when he has enough confidence that you will be able to resolve the situation. This code activates the door to the helicopter pad, which allows you and certain picked advisers to travel to the scene of the hijack in an attempt to deal with the terrorists.<br/><br/>Throughout, keeping the press on-side is also important. Neglect them or having high-profile failures will result in negative headlines. If things get too bad, the President may decide to fire you!<br/><br/>Credits:<br/><br/>Program &amp; Graphics: David Shea of Paradise Software<br/>Game Design: Mark Eyles<br/>Animation: Nigel Brownjohn<br/><br/>"}, "193408": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Darren Broad"], "poll": [], "name": "Optimatics: The Card Game", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Press Your Luck", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Promotional Board Games"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2912965_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2912965.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Industry / Manufacturing"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Optimatics flagship optimisation software, Optimizer, is a powerful tool to help engineers optimally design their water systems.<br/><br/>In Optimatics: The Card Game players compete to put together the most interesting Optimizer project by collecting hydraulic models, decisions, criteria, objectives and cloud computing subscriptions.

An albatross circles the shipwreck that lies broken on the shore. The sun is setting and a warm light starts to shine from inside the gaping ship; it&rsquo;s the Smuggler&rsquo;s Cove inn.<br/><br/>Four Captains sit at a round table at the center of the inn; some of the other guests are staring at the brightly coloured clothes they are wearing. A parrot closely watches the whole scene from a chandelier above the table. The colourful captains don&rsquo;t seem to mind; they talk, rest, laugh and enjoy their beers.<br/><br/>Suddenly a small boy runs in, holding a sealed letter for the innkeeper. After reading the letter, the innkeeper glances at the other guests before walking over to the four captains. In a low whisper he says &ldquo;Friends, my contact from the Republic tells me that the price of pepper has just surpassed the price of gold&rdquo;, and turns back to his bar.<br/><br/>The mood changes as a storm on a summer day and the captains reach for their weapons as if struck by lightning. Cautiously, they slowly stand up and back off from the table, but as their greed gets the better of them, they start running to their brightly coloured ships&hellip;<br/><br/><br/>Players start the game on smuggler's cove as one of these brightly coloured captains. Each captain owns a small ship with a tiny crew, one cannon and an empty cargo hold. Over the course of the game, each captain gathers resources to upgrade their ship at the shipyards of the Orient and the Republic or trades its cargo for valuable pepper in the Orient to get shares in the Trading Company and ensure their victory.<br/><br/>The amount of sails determines how far you move per turn. Crew is used for boarding other ships and plundering cargo. Cannons deal damage to other ships and the size of your cargo hold determines how much cargo you can load and carry.<br/><br/>Each player holds a hidden hand of cards from his own deck that can be used as temporary buffs to sail further, carry more cargo, or change the tide of battle.<br/><br/>Besides all this players can hire the notorious pirate at Smugglers Cove, to secretly ambush other captains.<br/><br/><br/>CotGA has 0% randomness, all skill. Its main mechanics are pick-up and deliver combined with hand-management and bluff. Players choose the length of the game by the size of their starter ships.<br/><br/>Trade cargo to upgrade your sails, crew, cannons or cargo holds. Attack other captains and board their ships to plunder cargo. Hire the notorious pirate to ambush competitors. Whatever your strategy, always keep one eye on the captain with pepper in his cargo hold.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "180", "name": "Captains of the Golden Age", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Memory", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Rock-Paper-Scissors", "Trading"], "age": "11", "boardgameexpansion": ["212469"], "usersrated": "69", "average": "7.33768", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["HLG 11: Stilte voor de Storm", "HLG-EXTRA 4: Spiel 2016 Deel 2", "The Game Pit Podcast: Episode 73 - Spiel \u201816 Treasure Hunt Part 3"]}, "193418": {"poll": [], "name": "Bleeding Border", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Horror"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Curse Box Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Survival"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Curse Box Studios"], "description": "Bleeding Border is a first person 3d survival horror game in which the player must escape through the top of a monster infested building using his own blood as the only defense mechanism.<br/><br/>The game starts with Zoey, losing blood from a fresh amputated arm, after a scavenge incursion went south and all her team members were killed by the apparently indestructible PaleOnes.<br/>Zoey escaped thanks to a rare genetic mutation that makes her blood act like poison in contact with the PaleOnes bodies(it&rsquo;s a shame that to find that she first had to lose her arm :( )<br/><br/>Bleeding Border is inspired in old school games like ResidentEvil and Silent Hill, adding modern elements of gameplay and aesthetics.<br/>In this game the player needs to hide, run and avoid , and only as the last resource use blood, because as soon as the player hurts himself he will start to bleed, and die if his wounds are not treated in time.<br/><br/>Needless to say is an adventure with a lot of gore and blood filled action.<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "193419": {"rpgdesigner": ["Ben Warren"], "rpg": ["Pandora London"], "statistics": [], "name": "Cupid's Arrow", "rpgartist": ["Ben Warren"], "rpgproducer": ["Ben Warren"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2879953.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Modern Urban Fantasy)", "Mythology / Folklore"], "rpgpublisher": ["Cascade Studios"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2879953_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Some believe that the Roman God Cupid was an elaborate disguise worn by Eros, the protegonos of generation, and if this were true then his bloodline would have a direct connection to the Primordial Dieties, truly making them a force to be reckoned with.

Things tend to go right for them, not always, but often enough to make them, and those around them, supernaturally fortunate.<br/><br/>This book also contains gambling rules, magic items and equipment.<br/><br/>Having a Chancer in your party can easily mean the difference between success and failure and if you&rsquo;re relying on luck, they&rsquo;re essential.<br/><br/>Chancers are assets, making things easier not just for themselves but for everyone around them. The randomness of some of their special abilities can disrupt and disorder an otherwise ordered battlefield, usually to your benefit, sometimes to your detriment. They&rsquo;re good in social situations and can raise money quickly, since they&rsquo;re far more likely to win games of chance or bluff than anyone else. The trouble with that of course is that it makes enemies who don&rsquo;t like being cheated.<br/><br/>Fifth Fantasy is intended to be a short series of alternative character classes, which are supposed to emulate the kinds of characters and roles found in classic JRPG and Anime games. As such they are most suited to high-magic games, and games which play up to the style of anime, manga and Japanese computer games.<br/><br/>No world is explicitly described, but the character class books will also contain magical items and some background material that will build an implicit setting - which may be detailed in the future.<br/><br/>"}, "193481": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3367934.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "20", "boardgamepublisher": ["War Games LLC"], "boardgameintegration": ["Cards Against Humanity", "Cards Against Humanity"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3367934_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Humor", "Mature / Adult", "Party Game"], "description": "A Cards Against Humanity style game targeted at veterans and members of the military.

Prompt (black) and response (white) cards. Every player starts with a hand of ten response cards.<br/><br/>One player draws a prompt card and reads it aloud. The others each play a response card(s) they think is the most appropriate, amusing, or horrible. The player reading the prompt card shuffles the response cards, and chooses the one they like the most. The winner of the round takes the prompt card for a point, the answers are discarded, everyone draws to fill their hands, and the person clockwise reads the next prompt card.<br/><br/>If your cards suck (unlikely), or you&rsquo;re not funny enough to win a round (more likely) and you&rsquo;d like to redraw, just swap a prompt card for a new hand. If you&rsquo;re really hurting for wins you can also swap a prompt card for the opportunity to play two answers cards at once during the next round. If that doesn&rsquo;t score a point then maybe you consider stamp collecting.<br/><br/>Whoever has the most prompt cards at the end, or is the last one conscious wins fame, fortune, and everlasting glory.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "4", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "average": "8", "name": "F.U.B.A.R.: Bringing out the worst in America's best", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": ["209453"], "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Cards Against Humanity", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "193482": {"poll": [], "name": "Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA \u0192 2nd", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American PlayStation 3 edition", "North American PS Vita edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2887501.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA"], "videogametheme": ["Anime", "Music"], "videogamegenre": ["Rhythm"], "usersrated": "3", "videogamedeveloper": ["SEGA Corporation"], "videogamefranchise": ["Hatsune Miku"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 3", "PlayStation Vita"], "videogamehonor": ["2014 Operation Rainfall Awards Best Soundtrack of the Year Nominee"], "average": "9", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SEGA of America, Inc."], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2887501_t.jpg", "description": "The game is set to have a similar play style to its predecessor, Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA F, whilst featuring new songs, returning songs from previous games, and character modules.
