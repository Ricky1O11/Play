Expansion and hostility will find you involved in galactic warfare with entire empires but this is essential if the player wants to obtain the ultimate goal of conquering the galaxy.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "193024": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2882347.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"209830": {"name": "Lock 'n Load Tactical: Solo"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"26104": {"name": "Jeff Lewis"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"85732": "Blackwell Hird"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"6025": {"name": "Lock 'n Load Publishing, LLC."}}, "boardgameintegration": {"184559": "Lock 'n Load Tactical: Heroes in Defiance"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2882347_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1119": {"name": "Game System"}}, "description": "Lock &rsquo;n Load Tactical&rsquo;s Version 4.1 (v4.1) World War II-era Core Rules Edition is the latest set of guidelines and regulations for the game system written by Jeff Lewis, Lead Developer of the Lock &rsquo;n Load Tactical Series.<br/><br/>These rules present the core rules for the game system for modules taking place from 1930 to 1959.

We will lend what support and allies as we can. Find the knowledge we seek and be rewarded...<br/><br/>Odin Quest is a solitaire game of Myths and Omens with artwork by Todd Sanders on 90 tarot sized playing cards which plays in about an hour of time.<br/><br/>Needed to play:<br/>90 game cards &bull; 1 player marker &bull; 7 six-sided dice<br/>13 black, 12 red, 12 yellow, 1 white and 1 blue cubes used as tokens<br/><br/>Setup:<br/>Separate the 7 decks of cards into separate marked decks: Ward, Event, Ally, Foe, Conflict, Realms and your Action cards.<br/><br/>Deal the 9 Realms + Valh&ouml;ll in a ring, face up.<br/><br/>Shuffle the Ward, Event, Ally, Foe and Conflict decks, placing them below the Realms as draw piles. Draw and place, face down, a number of cards as directed by the icons and dots on the Realm cards above the Realms in a stack.<br/><br/>Phases of Play:<br/>1. Explore: From your current Realm you may move one Realm either clockwise or counter clockwise. You may also move to the Asbr&uacute; card (if this side is currently face up), rotating Asbr&uacute; so the top of the card is aligned with your current Realm. You may then cross the ring to the card opposite to the bottom of the Asbr&uacute; card. After doing so, flip the Asbr&uacute; card to the Mimisbrunnr side.<br/><br/>At the new Realm, turn over any face down cards which are above it in order, one by one. Put any Foe cards that Events have had you place in this or another Realm on top of the stack of cards.<br/><br/>There are two types of Realms in Odin Quest:  <br/>Light Realms, where you will find Allies <br/>Dark Realms where you will find Foes<br/><br/>At each Realm you may also encounter Events or find Wards. Occasionally new Foes will be placed on Realms you have already visited.<br/><br/>2. Encounter: At the occupied Realm you will encounter the stack of cards above that Realm. Turn each over one by one and encounter each separately. Any previously active Foes at this Realm will be encountered first, then the rest of the card stack.<br/><br/>When Encountering Events - Follow the directions on the card. Most Events usually add Omen Tokens - Doom, Fear or Greed to the Event or to neighboring cards.<br/><br/>When Encountering Foes - At each Realm, if a Foe or Foes is encountered, draw one Conflict card. This card is used for all Foes in the Realm and will give each Foe a base value for the encounter as well as a Special Action which overrides other rule texts. Next, roll 7 dice, placing them in numerical order from low to high and adding their specified values to the base value for that Foe. This will be the Foe&rsquo;s Encounter Value.<br/><br/>You may now play Action Cards, Allies and Wards from your hand with some restrictions. Once you have played your combination of cards, roll the dice as shown on your Action cards, and on any Ally or Ward cards, adding together the total for your Encounter Value. Your Encounter Value must be higher than the Foe value to succeed in the Encounter.<br/><br/>When Encountering Allies - When encountering an Ally you may only use your Action and Ward cards in the Encounter. Similar rules apply to calculating the Ally Encounter Value and your Encounter value as they did for encountering a Foe. You do not draw a Conflict card when encountering Allies.<br/><br/>3. Resolution: After all encounters are resolved the Realm is considered &ldquo;Cleared&rdquo; if no Foes remain there. This Realm will never have new Foes, Omen tokens or Events placed on it. If a future Event has you placing Omen tokens, skip this Realm. Any Events on this Realm will remain here however as well any current Omen tokens. You may only remove these Omen tokens as your success in the game allows. Turn the Realm 90 degrees in the ring to signal it is cleared. You may move through this Realm during the 1. Explore phase if you so choose.<br/><br/>4. Quest End: The game ends after you have cleared all Nine Realms and defeated all Foes. Valh&ouml;ll, where you began your quest, never needs to be cleared.<br/><br/>If you ever have 2 or fewer Action cards remaining in your hand and discard pile combined OR there are currently more than 18 Omen tokens on the Realms and/or Foes, your quest ends and you have lost.<br/><br/>If you have defeated all Foes and have 3 or more Action cards in your hand and discard pile combined, you have won and may calculate your victory points based on certain conditions.<br/><br/>"}, "193121": {"boardgamedesigner": {"6076": {"name": "Christian Fiore"}}, "average": "6.37069", "poll": {}, "name": "Legends", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2663": "Time Track"}, "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "76", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2871721_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"11883": "Franz Vohwinkel"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"34": {"name": "Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2871721.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"299738": "German first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1097": {"name": "Travel"}}, "age": "9", "minplaytime": "40", "description": "Four members of the prestigious &quot;Club of Adventurers&quot; in London have made a bet amongst themselves to see who can travel to the eight most legendary places in the world over 75 weeks and learn the most about these places while visiting.

A mathematical model coupled with a professional course design creates an experience that rivals the real thing. The winning player will be the one whom manages risk v.s. reward and the conditions in the most favorable way.<br/><br/>Doshboardgolf uses a hex-based board to simulate a 9 hole golf course. Players have the choice of 12 directions to shoot from each hex and can even plan for fade and slice!<br/>This course has everything a real course would; straight fairways; water and trees as hazards; elevation changes and even simulated wind conditions.<br/><br/>The game is different every time &ndash; there are 60 different wind settings and 32 different clubs. Four 12-sided dice establish the strategic variability expected with ace runs, doinked putts, roll-aways, out-of-bounds, elevation change, lost clubs, and difficult lies. You will feel the joy of an excellent shot and the defeat of a poor decision. Doshboardgolf is all the strategy of golf on your table.<br/><br/>In Doshboardgolf, each player selects a set of 8 club cards that have differing distance and hook numbers. Players will have all the clubs they need, from the maximum distance driver and mid-range approach club down to the putter which will be used when holing out.<br/>The distance will be determined by rolling a blue die, and the hook determined by the red die only after consulting the players chosen club card.<br/><br/>Using advanced rules, a black die is introduced to simulate roll-aways when you land next to a downhill hex. Also making the game more realistic is elevation changes and penalties when having to shoot out of a hex containing trees.<br/><br/>During a turn, each player in order will:<br/>1. Plan a shot direction using one orange pawn as a directional marker on the board. Players have the ability to execute planned fade and slice to overcome obstructions on the board such as trees, water hazards and elevation changes<br/>2. Select a club card from your 8 available options and place it face up for all players to see<br/>3. Execute the shot by rolling the blue and red dice. After consulting the chosen club card, the blue die determines the distanced travelled, and the red die determines the hook which will happen after the distance is calculated<br/>4. Place your player token in the new lie or if you have successfully holed out, mark your score on the included scorecard<br/>Play continues in this way with the player furthest from the hole always going next.<br/>As in real golf, the player with the lowest score at the end of the 9 hole round is the winner!<br/><br/>"}, "193193": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2956923.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"199012": {"name": "Watchmen of Destiny: Bloody Mercenaries Expansion"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"90956": {"name": "Lukas Litvaj"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": {"3320": {"name": "(Unknown)"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2956923_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "25", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Assemble a great army of watchmen &amp; protect the Tree of Destiny.

There it is, the starting signal!<br/><br/>Dashing ahead with your chariot, slowly at first, but quickly gaining speed&hellip; circling the spina in the center of the arena to complete the first lap. The next corner comes closer. Glancing back, one of the chariots is already far behind, and just ahead another chariot's speed is too high for the corner, sending the vehicle crashing into the wall and out of the race. Only a single chariot blocks your path to victory, so it's time to get uncivilized. Steadily you balance the javelin in your hand, waiting for the other charioteer to come into view&hellip;or should you just overtake him and throw caltrops in his path?<br/><br/>In Chariot Race, players participate as charioteers in a great race in ancient Rome. Use the dice to complete two laps on the dusty arena's circuit and be the first to steer your chariot over the finish line. On a player's turn, if they have gained enough Favors of Fortuna, they can repair their chariot. Depending on the chariot's speed on the previous turn and its current condition, the initial speed is determined, which defines how many of the five dice will be rolled during the turn. Each face of the six-sided dice allows a different action: Gain new Favors, increase or decrease speed, change lanes, or attack opponents (either directly by hurling javelins or indirectly by dropping caltrops in their path). if the first roll is not satisfactory, the player may call on Fortuna to influence the dice, as long they have her favor. Once the result is set, the player moves their chariot forward according to the final speed they achieved and may then take actions against their rivals.<br/><br/>However, breakneck racing and ramming are not without risk. If two chariots collide, they both take damage, and cornering at a wild gallop is not recommended. The further the safe speed is exceeded, the more damage is caused to the vehicle &ndash; which might fall apart in the middle of the arena if the driver is too careless, resulting in their elimination from the race.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"330381": "English first edition"}, "average": "6.06239", "name": "Chariot Race", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "8", "usersrated": "393", "boardgameaccessory": {"218892": "Chariot Race: Wooden Meeples"}, "boardgamefamily": {"23986": "Roll Through the Ages"}}, "193213": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3186335.png", "is_expanded_by": {"211151": {"name": "Millions of Dollars: Spotted by the FBI"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"88146": {"name": "Jeremie Kletzkine"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": {"77705": "Cari"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5400": {"name": "Matagot"}}, "maxplaytime": "25", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3186335_t.png", "minplaytime": "25", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "description": "Every division of booty is a tense situation.

This book is a resource for Game Masters to pick and choose from, whichever suits your fancy.

If all other players agree with the accusation, the round ends and the accused player has to reveal his identity. If the spy is uncovered, all other players score points.  However, the spy can himself end a round by announcing that he understands what the secret location is; if his guess is correct, only the spy scores points.<br/><br/>After a few rounds of guessing, suspicion and bluffing, the game ends and whoever has scored the most points is victorious!<br/><br/>Spyfall 2 features the same gameplay as Spyfall with two important changes: (1) Enough location cards are included that the upper player count is now twelve instead of eight, and (2) two spies can be found at each location, giving all of the non-spy players more of a challenge when it comes to tracking down who doesn't belong.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"324184": "Cryptozoic English first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "name": "Spyfall 2", "playingtime": "10", "boardgamemechanic": {"2073": "Acting"}, "age": "13", "usersrated": "382", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5498": "Party Games"}, "average": "7.41539"}, "193309": {"boardgamedesigner": {"39722": {"name": "Tony Cimino"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Arena Bizarre", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2877750_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"39722": "Tony Cimino"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2877750.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"300066": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "The Devious Darkos Blackovian has gathered the most bizarre, dangerous and funny teams of creatures in his Arena in order to entertain and also surprise his audience which came from almost anywhere to bear witness to this weird spectacle.<br/><br/>Each player controls a team of creatures and the main goal is to get the creatures into the Arena and manage to get them out safe before any other player does.<br/>Players alternate turns rolling dice,playing creatures into the Arena and, if able, remove their creatures and/or pile them on other player's creatures in order to slow them down.

These lethal legends of Latin America range from CR 1 to 30, including such Aztec-inspired creatures as eye-gouging ahuizotl and the apocalyptic harbinger from the stars, the tzitzimitl.

Players are also dealt five Life cards. The space directly in front of a player is their Room, where cards will be played during the course of the game. Slack can be represented using any available chit or counter, but every player begins with a Slack total of zero.<br/><br/>Players take turns as follows:<br/><br/>     Draw Life cards until they have six in hand. (NOTE: Some Jobs vary this to five or seven cards.)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>     Make &quot;variable&quot; rolls. Some Job cards have variable free time or income; their values for this turn are decided in this phase (rolling a 1-3 gives them the first amount; rolling a 4-6 gives them the second). If there are any &quot;uninvited&quot; people in a player's room, he or she may also roll to &quot;get rid of&quot; them (by rolling a 4, 5 or 6) and either send each such person to another room or discard them (if they cannot be played to any other room).<br/><br/><br/><br/>     If any of the player's in-hand Life cards are green Person cards, they may roll to &quot;call&quot; the person to their room. A successful roll (3-6) gets them invited in; otherwise, they are discarded. Some people are &quot;uninvited&quot; (causing bad things to happen), and may be placed without a roll in any player's room. (See above for &quot;getting rid of&quot; these people.) Pet cards, such as Cats (which don't require a roll to enter a room) and Dogs (which may or may not need to be &quot;called&quot;) can also be played in this round.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     For each unit of free time the player's Job card gives them, they may perform one action (play a red Activity card) or go shopping (play any number of blue Thing cards). Some of these cards may have a cost; the total cost for all cards played in a round cannot exceed the income given to them by their Job card. (NOTE: Free Time and Income may be modified by certain Whenever cards played on the player by themselves or other players.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>     At the end of a turn, if a player has more than five cards in hand, the player must discard cards until they have five or fewer. If desired, players can discard all the way down to one card. (NOTE: It is also legal for a player to play ALL the cards in their hand and have NO cards at the end of a turn.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Additionally, some Life cards are orange &quot;Whenever&quot; cards which can be played at any time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Activity cards and Thing cards typically list a Slack value which is added to the player's Slack total, though some have random Slack totals and some have Slack totals which vary during the game. TV Activity cards and some Whenever cards can be used to cancel cards as they are being played, and some cause previously-played cards to be discarded. Some cards add or subtract Slack from every player's total, while others cause a player to change their Job card (and hence Slack goal). Many cards alter the effects of other cards.<br/><br/><br/>The first player whose Slack total equals or exceeds their Slack goal is the winner.<br/><br/>This edition of Chez Geek from Pegasus Spiele includes both the Chez Geek base game and Chez Geek 2: Blockparty &ndash; the Chez Geek sequel from Pegasus that included both of the expansions from Steve Jackson Games: Chez Geek 2: Slack Attack and Chez Geek 3: Block Party.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"300119": "First edition"}, "average": "5.625", "name": "Chez Geek 1+2", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2004": "Set Collection"}, "age": "13", "usersrated": "12", "boardgamefamily": {"5389": "Chez Geek"}}, "193339": {"rpgitemversion": {"300121": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Mask of Vexicon", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2876918.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"25107": "Filbar"}, "rpgproducer": {"74343": "Frank Schmidt"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"13236": "AD&D First Edition (1e) Compatible Products"}, "average": "0", "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"24828": "Adventures in Filbar"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2876918_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Today&rsquo;s Filbar Friday offers continues in the Dual Series with FD8 &ndash; Mask of Vexicon!

Each of these will have an impact on various aspects of performance in the race (maximum speed, miles per gallon, etc.).<br/><br/>During the race the pit stops are key. When a bike comes into the pits, the player directly controls the pit crew, who must move to the correct part of the bike in order to perform various tasks such as refueling, making repairs, changing tyres and/or brake pads, etc. Pit stops also give the opportunity to switch riders, who each have different characteristics.<br/><br/>Credits:<br/><br/>By G.P.

The aim of the game is to kill the other two Princes and become crowned King.<br/><br/>The Citadel is built around the caldera of a smouldering volcano and is completely circular. Therefore if the player moves in one direction they will ultimately end up where they started. The castle is also built over multiple floors and towers.<br/><br/>The Citadel is depicted at the bottom of the screen silhouetted against the sky. Windows are either lit, showing the colour of the Prince or Men-at-Arms occupying the room. In addition there are King's Guard depicted in Green. Rooms which are unoccupied are black and are therefore invisible against the castle wall.<br/><br/>The screen is split in two vertically. Each player can see the Citadel at the bottom and a view of the room for the character they are currently controlling (their Prince, or one of their Men-at-Arms). Only one character can be controlled at a time. Characters which are currently not being controlled will stay in the room where they were left and will defend themselves if attacked, but not as well as if they were under the control of the player.<br/><br/>Various weapons can be picked up with different strengths and weaknesses. Men-at-Arms can hold one weapon each, whereas the Princes can hold up to three and cycle between them.<br/><br/>Control of two types of room are key to the game. Gate Rooms are links to the outside world from which new Men-at-Arms occasionally enter. They side with the player who last controlled that room. The Throne Room is the ultimate objective. A Prince unopposed in the Throne Room becomes crowned King. At this point the Men-at-Arms of the opposing players become frozen, and in addition the King gains control of the King's Guard. The other players, while on the back foot at this point, still have hope, as killing the King will return the Crown to the Throne Room and return the King's Guard to neutral control.<br/><br/>Credits:<br/><br/>Game Design: Mike Singleton<br/>Programming, Graphics and Music: Consult Computer Systems<br/>Cover Illustration: David Rowe<br/><br/>"}, "193378": {"poll": {}, "name": "Grand Prix Racing Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2906424_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"31679": {"name": "Spar"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2906424.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"300204": "Greek edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1031": {"name": "Racing"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "2 Fast 4 you!<br/>Fast racing cars ~ public pitstop ~ playing money ~ digital dice &amp; more... 2 to 4 players ~ several levels ~ age 5 to 105 years<br/><br/>Players must collect as much money as they can during the laps of the race (to be agreed by the players, from 5 minimum to 18 maximum).

To eject them fully from there the Soviets instigated Operation Gory/Morsky - a joint operation by land, air, and sea. This is a conflict simulation of the part of that operation encompassing the assault on the port city of Novorossiysk.<br/><br/>Two or more players assume opposed sides. Either the German and Romanians, or the Soviets. With a time scale of some nine days (the game can end before then), the Soviets are tasked with landing naval infantry (the Black Devils),dropping paratroopers, and using land forces in an attempt to take control of the city. As well as the basic game there are also several shorter scenarios.<br/><br/>Units in the game are represented by 20x20x10mm blocks increasing the level of fog of war. The game map portrays the region around Novorossiysk and uses a hexagonal grid of small hexes that are grouped into larger seven hex 'Air Space' zones for air combat and paratroop drops. Each small hex is approximately 2 kms across. The game covers the nine days of the assault (one full turn per day) with three separate phases per day (morning, afternoon, and night). A Weather section ascertains the weather for each phase.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"300222": "First edition"}, "age": "14", "name": "By Mountains and Sea", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"6137": "Block wargames"}}, "193391": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Arcana Journal (Issue 81 - Feb 2016)", "rpgproducer": {"5349": "Robert Hemminger"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3054666.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"6499": "Arcana Journal"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"183706": "House Vainnier Holdings"}, "rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpgissueversion": {"300229": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3054666_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The true wonders of Arcana are explored in the monthly journals.

HIJACK is a skilful combination of arcade, strategy and simulation. The game sets you up in charge of a Pentagon department, the Hijack Division, dedicated to stamping out terrorism by peaceful means.<br/>HIJACK is played using live action and complex windowing techniques as you fight a desperate struggle against bureaucracy to end a hijacking before all hell is let loose.<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>Hijack places the player in the role of the head of an anti-terrorist Hijack Division of the US Government. Terrorists have set a deadline and your job is to defeat them in one of three ways - 1) Raising enough money to pay them off, 2) Raising enough political power to persuade them to give in or 3) Raising a large enough military force to scare them into submission.<br/><br/>This is achieved through working with other members of government. Some are more senior that you, such as the President, others are at the same level as you and others are subordinate. Working to gain their loyalty and respect, and using their different skills is one of the key aspects of the game. Choosing how much time to spend on different activities is also important. For example, the CIA agent can gather intelligence, but a hastily prepared report will only give details of the terrorist demands, while allowing more time for a longer report will give information of potential bargaining tactics and who they are working for. But of course by the time you receive the detailed report, you may not have time to act upon it.<br/><br/>As you gain the confidence of the different members of staff, they may grant you three digit codes which allow additional options to be used. These codes may also be found by examining documents, etc. The ultimate three digit code is provided by the President when he has enough confidence that you will be able to resolve the situation. This code activates the door to the helicopter pad, which allows you and certain picked advisers to travel to the scene of the hijack in an attempt to deal with the terrorists.<br/><br/>Throughout, keeping the press on-side is also important. Neglect them or having high-profile failures will result in negative headlines.

An albatross circles the shipwreck that lies broken on the shore. The sun is setting and a warm light starts to shine from inside the gaping ship; it&rsquo;s the Smuggler&rsquo;s Cove inn.<br/><br/>Four Captains sit at a round table at the center of the inn; some of the other guests are staring at the brightly coloured clothes they are wearing. A parrot closely watches the whole scene from a chandelier above the table. The colourful captains don&rsquo;t seem to mind; they talk, rest, laugh and enjoy their beers.<br/><br/>Suddenly a small boy runs in, holding a sealed letter for the innkeeper. After reading the letter, the innkeeper glances at the other guests before walking over to the four captains. In a low whisper he says &ldquo;Friends, my contact from the Republic tells me that the price of pepper has just surpassed the price of gold&rdquo;, and turns back to his bar.<br/><br/>The mood changes as a storm on a summer day and the captains reach for their weapons as if struck by lightning. Cautiously, they slowly stand up and back off from the table, but as their greed gets the better of them, they start running to their brightly coloured ships&hellip;<br/><br/><br/>Players start the game on smuggler's cove as one of these brightly coloured captains. Each captain owns a small ship with a tiny crew, one cannon and an empty cargo hold. Over the course of the game, each captain gathers resources to upgrade their ship at the shipyards of the Orient and the Republic or trades its cargo for valuable pepper in the Orient to get shares in the Trading Company and ensure their victory.<br/><br/>The amount of sails determines how far you move per turn. Crew is used for boarding other ships and plundering cargo. Cannons deal damage to other ships and the size of your cargo hold determines how much cargo you can load and carry.<br/><br/>Each player holds a hidden hand of cards from his own deck that can be used as temporary buffs to sail further, carry more cargo, or change the tide of battle.<br/><br/>Besides all this players can hire the notorious pirate at Smugglers Cove, to secretly ambush other captains.<br/><br/><br/>CotGA has 0% randomness, all skill. Its main mechanics are pick-up and deliver combined with hand-management and bluff. Players choose the length of the game by the size of their starter ships.<br/><br/>Trade cargo to upgrade your sails, crew, cannons or cargo holds. Attack other captains and board their ships to plunder cargo. Hire the notorious pirate to ambush competitors.

This state of affairs alone creates a dramatic story, in which conflicts must be resolved and consensus reached before any action can be taken.
