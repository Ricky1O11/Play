Resources will prove important and become continually scarce as MV1 continues to sweep through your territory. Do you have what it takes to keep your people alive?

Many technologies lay at your disposal if you test them successfully, but the true strength of these technologies lie in the versatile combinations that you choose to use. Will you rely on military strength, physics and science, or research medicine to find a cure? Perhaps your survival lies in utilizing combinations of these technologies.

Each turn zombies feed and randomly spread throughout your territory, quickly reducing your population and increasing the number of zombies.

Each turn you must maximize the use of resources to draft and use military, test technologies, and then strategically use these successfully tested technologies.  As the game progresses, outbreaks and the spread of zombies makes the game more difficult through a loss of population, resources, and freedom to act.  However, if you have been an effective leader you will have developed effective technologies that you may use to try and eliminate the threat from your territory completely.

Through simple mechanics and low on-map counter density, players easily handle the strategic action without a myriad of complicated subsystems or tall stacks of counters.<br/><br/>As one gamer put it, &quot;It is a delight to be spending my limited brain power on making (or agonizing over) operational decisions that are as dependent upon guts as they are gray matter. This game is not a series of arithmetic exercises, and the only variable in these algorithms is nerve.&quot;<br/><br/>Though the focus is on the big picture, Unconditional Surrender! still delivers historical detail. Each country has an historical army level order of battle, and its relative economic strength and national will to fight are effectively and simply modeled.

The authors use 10mm miniatures, but any size figures can be used as long as the base size is maintained.<br/><br/>During each turn, each brigade, division and corps HQ throws a six-sided die for activation.  Players then draw cards one by one from a deck composed of black and red cards from 1-6 plus a single joker.  Each time a card matching the dice result thrown by the HQ is drawn, elements of that HQ can activate for movement, fire, etc.  HQ's can exchange dice with the HQ above or below it, in order to seize the initiative.  When the joker is drawn, the turn ends.<br/><br/>Each stand fires by adding its attack factor to a d10 roll; hits are caused by equalling or exceeding the target's defense factor varies with unit type and terrain.  Regiments have 3 step losses.:  when a unit takes one hit, it fires at half strength (factors are not modified, but any odd die roll is an automatic miss); on a second hit, fire is at half strength and units may fire only on black cards; on the third hit, the unit is eliminated.

However, a new evil is rising that intends to destroy them all. When a veritable army of shuffling undead horrors spills into their streets, the locals know that this is the beginning of the end...unless a band of heroes can find the source of this new threat and put a stop to it. Should they falter, should they fail, it will mean not only the doom of Erburg, but also all the surrounding lands. Temple of the Death Goddess is fifth in Green Ronin's Bleeding Edge Adventures. Used as a sequel to the engaging A Dreadful Dawn or on its own as a stand alone scenario, this adventure promises a chilling experience as the heroes must confront a new form of wickedness in the bowels of a rotting temple dedicated to the fearsome Goddess of Death. As with all of the adventures in this series, Temple of the Death Goddess combines thrilling action, immersive roleplaying, and terrifying environments guaranteed to push your games to the bleeding edge of adventure!<br/><br/>Initative Cards: Temple of the Death Goddess<br/><br/>Keeping track of initiative in 3rd Era games can get complicated. Every GM has a method that he or she favors, but which sometimes lacks versatility or utility. Initiative Cards provide GMs with an easy way to keep track of initiative and a handy reference for all the sorts of information a GM sometimes needs during a game session.<br/><br/>There are two different types of Initiative Cards: character cards and monster cards. Character cards contain information about the player characters and the occasional non-player character. You can use these cards for familiars as well. Monster cards contain information about monsters (though it's best to use character cards for monsters that have class levels). You can use these cards for most animal companions as well.<br/><br/>The monster cards in this publication provide GMs with preprinted monster cards for Bleeding Edge Adventure #5: Temple of the Death Goddess. All of the necessary information has already been filled in&mdash;all the GM needs to do is print and cut the cards he or she needs, and perhaps complete blank character cards if the players are not using the pre-generated PCs from the adventure. And, they're provided free with the purchase of Temple of the Death Goddess.<br/><br/>"}, "61001": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic657393.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"2336": {"name": "Kevin Wilson"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"12438": "Ryan Barger"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3475": {"name": "Arclight"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic657393_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "description": "This is the first expansion set for the Fantasy Flight Games version of Cosmic Encounter.<br/>Adapted from the Fantasy Flight web site:<br/><br/>Over the years, alien empires have risen and fallen.

Try an apocalypse: it can do wonders for your game. Forgotten Heroes: Fang, Fist, and Song uses an apocalypse theme to re-introduce four new character classes to your 4E game. The druid, barbarian, monk, and bard all have their place in a cataclysmic destruction of the old world that clears the way for a fresh age of heroes -- and they also make for great additions to any existing campaign. This GSL sourcebook provides players with everything they need to play these base classes in their 4E games!<br/><br/>The barbarian is a tough as nails warrior that can take serious punishment while dealing out a respectable amount of carnage himself. The barbarian's role is the defender, and he excels at intercepting the attacks and movements of his enemies to protect his companions.<br/><br/>Bards are leaders, using music to bolster their comrades with rousing songs and strike down foes with reverberating percussion or the stinging cut of a note sharper than steel. Bards are also a living archive of much that has been forgotten, and can use this esoteric knowledge to point out the weaknesses of their foes through the deft flourish of a rapier.<br/><br/>The druid is a master of primal forces, a controller who taps into the elements to push back the encroaching borders of civilization. Druids are fiercely protective of all that grows wild and free, lashing out with fire, ice, and lightning against all that would defile the sanctity of the natural world.<br/><br/>Monks are potent and versatile warriors, using speed and skill to bring down their foes with strange and exotic weapons or simply the calloused strength of their own fists and feet. The monk's skill flows from the mastery of mind and body and the careful study of ancient fighting styles and techniques. Monks excel in the role of striker, and can move through melee with startling agility, striking crippling blows from unexpected directions with fluid ease.<br/><br/>"}, "61009": {"rpgitemversion": {"15710": "PDF Version"}, "rpgseries": {"14410": "Portable Hole Full of Beer"}, "name": "Son of a Portable Hole!", "rpgproducer": {"15531": "M.

Superliga takes place in the twisted psyche of that particular player&rsquo;s mind &ndash;<br/>tiny splinters of the material plane float through some dark void where gigantic whales lurk. On some splinters, knights battle valiantly against dragons. On others, walking tanks fire missile salvos against psychic assassins. On the most numerous splinters, the same knights are bemusedly locked in combat with equally confused robots. All it takes to traverse from one splinter to the next is a little imagination, and of course a couple of skill points spent in the Planar school of magic.<br/><br/>"}, "61018": {"rpgitemversion": {"15731": "Updated, English Edited Version, Nov 2005"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Dark Dungeon (2nd Edition) Freeware Lite Version", "rpgproducer": {"30633": "Esmeralda Kleinreesink"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic598141.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "10", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"3834": "Dark Dungeon (1st & 2nd Editions)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic598141_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>The Dark Dungeon 2nd Edition game is designed to play fast and easy, give realistic results and provide a great variety between characters.

Each turn, you draw two cards from a common draw pile, and use these cards to form and assist your gang members. If you draw a gang member, you can add him to your gang (but have to pay him money each turn). If you draw a special ability (like drug king) or a racket (selling stolen cars, owning an illegal gaming club) you can attach it to any of your gang members. You can also happen to draw crack cards (alcoholic, drug addict, rat) that you have to attach to any of your members.<br/><br/>&quot;Smugglings&quot; and &quot;heists&quot; usually require more gang members than you have in your gang. Team up with another gang, decide on how to split the loot, roll the die to determine success. If the hit/smuggling failed, all participants must roll the die to see if they were caught (in which case the gang members are lost). If it succeeds, all gangs involved secretly choose the card &quot;deal&quot; or &quot;you're fucked&quot; and show it to the others simultaneously. If all shows &quot;deal&quot;, the loot is split according to the deal. If one of the gangs shows &quot;you're fucked&quot; he takes the lot. If two or more shows &quot;you're fucked&quot;, there is a shootout, the police arrives, and no one gets anything.<br/><br/>There is also the option to use your gang members to kill off your opponents cronies in order to take command of their rackets or to steal their money.<br/><br/>The game is language level 2 or 3 borderline case.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"269832": "First edition"}, "age": "15", "name": "Sthlm Maffia", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "6.45455", "usersrated": "22", "boardgamefamily": {"18620": "Cities: Stockholm"}}, "61044": {"rpgitemversion": {"15776": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Voidsparrow", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic714510.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"458": "Modern (Near Future)"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"305": "d20 Modern"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"3930": "Department 7 Advanced Class Update"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic714510_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>The Voidsparrow is an iconic symbol of mankind&rsquo;s expansion into deep space, a visible reminder of human courage, ingenuity, and combat-readiness. Voidsparrows are scouts and soldiers, defenders and explorers- they are cybernetically enhanced champions of humanity. Voidsparrow flight wings patrol trade routes, protecting human startravellers from space pirates and raiders, Lifechained xeno-monsters, and hostiles of all kind, human and otherwise.<br/><br/>The noble starfighters are instantly recognizable thanks to their gleaming, high-gloss cyberarmor and the hawklike wings and combat helmet that are their badges of rank. A mated pair of Voidsparrow partners soaring alongside a Earth-registered sublight cargo hauler is a common sight in most human operated ports of call. And an entire flight wing of Voidsparrow warriors filling the sky during manuevers or during a large scale engagement is an unforgettable sight.<br/><br/>Voidsparrow cyborgs are an advanced class designed for use in a high-tech starfaring campaign set at Progress Level 7 or on the verge of PL 8. The Voidsparrows work best in a campaign using FTL travel. As written, Voidsparrows are intended for a slightly less realistic, comic-book inspired sci-fi setting, though they can be integrated into a &lsquo;hard sci-fi&rsquo; setting simply by reducing the scope of their activities from galaxy-wide to solar system-wide, as well as by describing their distinctive bionics as being slightly cruder, relatively untested prototypes.<br/><br/>Voidsparrow characters can function in a D20 Modern campaign; they might be the first of their kind, wielding untested new bionics and establishing the traditions of their order. In this case, the first Voidsparrows might be an outgrowth of NASA or Department Seven&rsquo;s space program. The Voidsparrow can also be an alien visitor or a time-traveller stranded in the past. However, while Voidsparrows can function well planetside, they shine in deep space battles, and some of their class abilities are useless without an enemy starship to blast apart.<br/><br/>In the Psi-Watch and Otherverse America campaigns, Voidsparrows represent a unique breed of military cyborg, an elite branch of the world&rsquo;s space navies. It&rsquo;s easy to imagine these colorful, chromed cyborg knights as Psi-Watch operatives, and its just as easy to imagine them as lonely orbital warriors in the service of either the Lifer or Choicer factions.<br/><br/>"}, "61045": {"rpgitemversion": {"15777": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Unbound Soul", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic714469.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"458": "Modern (Near Future)"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"305": "d20 Modern"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"3930": "Department 7 Advanced Class Update"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic714469_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Are your sins so hideous you know that when you finally die that you'll burn forever, and you would do anything to cheat God's judgment?

The God's Dice campaign world is my take on the solar system 1000 years in the future, in a setting where faster-than-light travel is still just fantasy, and despite finding itself still alone in the lonely universe, mankind has managed to diversify itself into a stunning array of forms.<br/><br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/><br/>God's Dice is a future world designed for use as a role playing game setting. Currently, God's Dice is only a setting and does not have its own rules set. For rules, we will be using Fate Core, which is distributed for free at <a target='_blank' href='http://www.evilhat.com/projects/fudge/fate/' rel='nofollow'>http://www.evilhat.com/projects/fudge/fate/</a> and is based on Fudge ( <a target='_blank' href='http://www.fudgerpg.com/' rel='nofollow'>http://www.fudgerpg.com/</a> ). Later, rules specifically for God's Dice will be developed or simply customized from the FATE rules, but for now, FATE as written is more than enough.<br/><br/>The year is 2921, and Sol System is a bustling, thriving, humming society. Faster-Than-Light travel (FTL) continues to elude humanity, so even while there has been very little exploration of things outside Sol's immediate neighborhood, within the range of conventional propulsion systems, mankind and its offshoots have colonized and filled up every niche they could find or create. Minor sections of the earth have been regreened and preserved, but the majority of Earth's 28 billion people live and survive in monolithic tower cities rising sometimes rising thousands of meters above the ground, as well as burrowing deep into the earth below.<br/><br/>Luna is fully colonized. Its interior is burrowed through with innumerable catacombs, blistering into sealed domes and towers on the surface. Mars has been terraformed and is finally green (although technically, it's more of a muddy yellowish when viewed from space). Despite centuries of exploration, exploitation, and development, the Asteroid Belt is still seen mostly as a lawless frontier. Beyond the Belt, the Jovian Alliance is the newest growing power among the Solar governances. They have stations on all of Jupiter's large moons as well as orbiting habitats and other satellites. Beyond Jupiter is the true Fringe. There are legitimate science stations and other operations around Saturn and even the further planets. At least fifty permanent stations are known to exist in the Oort cloud beyond Pluto. But the Fringe is also the home to outsiders. There are Fringers in the quixotic realm of the far inner system - near Mercury's orbit, or even closer. Anywhere that the order of Sol breaks down - there you will find the Fringe.<br/><br/>"}, "61130": {"rpgitemversion": {"15887": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Calm Before The Storm: Ready-Made Player Characters", "rpgproducer": {"35151": "David A.

Dobberpuhl presents 10 spells from the core rules System Reference Document (SRD) converted for use with Monte Cook&rsquo;s Arcana Unearthed or the forthcoming Monte Cook&rsquo;s Arcana Evolved. The process of converting standard d20 spells for these variant player&rsquo;s handbooks appears in the DM&rsquo;s Screen and Player&rsquo;s Guide as well as in the Arcana Evolved appendix.<br/><br/>Even if you don&rsquo;t use the alternate magic system found in these variant player&rsquo;s handbooks, you may be interested in adapting these spells&rsquo; heightened versions (cast at one level higher than normal) and diminished versions (cast at one level lower than normal) in your own d20 games.<br/><br/>Some spell names are new or slightly altered from the originals to help differentiate the spell versions. In such cases, the new name appears first, followed by the core name. In a few cases (such as the &ldquo;fog cloud&rdquo; series), the alternate names serve as models you can use for renaming other spells that you convert from the SRD or even the ones in this article. You might, for example, have a mage in your game learn a slightly different version of the spells presented here, with different effects. For instance, corrosive mists might inflict 3d6 points of damage per round when heightened, but deal no temporary Strength damage and carry a different name, such as horrible fog of doom. Minor changes like this both keep players on their toes (&ldquo;Have you ever heard of this spell before? Me neither!&rdquo;) and prove useful in storytelling. (&ldquo;This is the spell MY master taught me! Now you shall see whose magic is stronger&hellip; your feeble corrosive mists or my superior horrible fog of doom!&rdquo;)<br/><br/>Some of the spells in this article were chosen to show how you can give the spells you modify a thematic set of effects that can enhance storytelling. For example, the colors used in acid arrow and corrosive mists are similar. Further, both spells, when heightened, cause victims to lose strength as the acid eats away at them. A few spells were chosen for this article because they are cool utilitarian spells that are fun to play around with. And some were tossed in as good, basic utility spells to round out the group.<br/><br/>Players of Arcana Unearthed will notice that a few of the spells include racial descriptors, which are introduced in Arcana Evolved.

That's why every treasure-hunter needs the proper equipment. With the introduction of our &quot;Adventurer Essentials&quot; line we will examine the items that every adventurer needs to ensure he makes it back alive for the next adventure. Time-tested, and proven by countless dungeon crawls and wilderness expeditions, these are the essentials you'll need to survive the dangers ahead.<br/><br/>The next piece of essential gear covered in the &quot;Adventurer Essentials&quot; line is the humble Bedroll. What piece of equipment is more cherished than the thick blanket an adventurer curls up inside after a march through a frozen wasteland? For most wanderers, a good bed at an inn is a rarity, and home is a distant memory. Most nights are spent under the indifferent stars. In the summer, the adventurer tosses and turns, a campaign&rsquo;s worth of sweat sticking to the armor he can&rsquo;t safely remove in-country, because he knows that in his business, danger always comes at night. During the winter, the adventurer huddles before a pitiful fire, shivering in ragged blankets as his breath freezes the moment it passes his chattering lips. During the rainy season, he sleeps in cloying mud, and wakes filthy and only slightly less exhausted than when he passed out the night before.<br/><br/>It doesn&rsquo;t matter though. For an adventurer, that ragged, straw filled bedroll and patched, mud-stained blanket is home, if only for one night. And if he is tired enough, the weary adventurer can convince himself that his sleeping rags are a sybarite&rsquo;s palace.<br/><br/>In this PDF we look at the history and legends of sleeping gear when far from home and hearth. Additionally we look at several varients of mundane bedrolls and accessories such as the standard bedroll, various blanket weights, the Legionares Bed, the Elven Sia Aia (Cocoon in Elvish), the Springing Tent, Verminbane Sachet and waterproofing methods.<br/><br/>An adventurer might pay to have her sword enchanted to slay dragons, or to have her cloak glamoured with silence and invisibility, or her shield blessed by a cleric of her god, but what kind of adventurer enchants her bedroll?<br/><br/>A smart one.<br/><br/>"}, "61163": {"rpgitemversion": {"15919": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Lantern", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic855317.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"524": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"3932": "Adventurer Essentials"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic855317_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>The next piece of essential gear covered in the &quot;Adventurer Essentials&quot; line is the Lantern.<br/><br/>You cannot fight what you cannot see.<br/><br/>You can&rsquo;t solve a puzzle if you can&rsquo;t find the pieces.<br/><br/>Without light, there is no heroism or victory, just blind frustration and futility. Lanterns are a uniquely human invention, a mechanical substitute for the keen night-eyes the nearly-human races possess. The lantern provides a way for a night-fighting human to meet his orcish, elven or dwarvish counterpart on equal footing, and the glow of a lantern lit city visible on the open plain is a tangible reminder of the power of human ingenuity to beat back the darkness.<br/><br/>No adventurer would ever dare wander into the coldly lethal caverns under the known world without a lantern held high.

A lonely extreme party has a small chance of presenting a complete and appealing policy package, while a large and stable alliance will harvest many voters.

His sheer brilliance and indomitable will allows him to walk with demons and converse with gods, and in both cases he is treated as a rare equal. In contrast with the traditional Wizard, the Wizard of Shadowfell casts spells rarely and with great deliberation, but the spells the arch mage masters are incredibly powerful and can change the course of history.<br/><br/>Wizards of Shadowfell excel at tactics and deception, and are well versed in the history of nations, politics and court intrigue. Despite this, few Shadowfell Wizards rule openly, with most choosing to be the voice behind the throne&rsquo;, or to rule through proxies.

It a weapon that is both glorified and vilified in art and literature. And it is a weapon that is conspicuous by its absence in the D20 rules.<br/><br/>Some players feel that guns would be overpowering in a fantasy world. But in a fantasy setting, primitive guns are less powerful and less reliable than their modern counter-parts, and healing magic is abundant. The odds are good, however, that you're reading this because you are interested in using guns in your fantasy game. The approach in this PDF is a little different from the gun rules that are usually presented for a fantasy setting. Guns are not so difficult to use that only those who spend years training can handle one properly. And they are not so expensive that only kings can requisition them. A gun is simple enough for most anyone to use, and rare enough that the average barkeeper can't afford one, but the average adventurer can.<br/><br/>Included in this PDF are:<br/><br/>    Racial attitudes towards Black Powder and Guns.<br/>    Rules for Pistols &amp; Muskets<br/>    Standard &amp; Magical Ammunition<br/>    Variant Black Powder Weapons such as the Kracking Spear &amp; Thunderhammer<br/>    Siege weapons such as Cannon's and the Dragon Ballista<br/>    New Rules, Feats, Spells &amp; Magic Items<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "61173": {"rpgitemversion": {"15930": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Fantasy Occupations & Signs", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic855322.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"524": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic855322_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>The d20 Modern game introduced an occupation system that adds minor advantages to characters while providing a lot depth. Characters have a background, and they gain benefits from their occupation past making a simple skill roll.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the occupations are very specific to the modern setting, as most reference skills and feats that don't translate well to the fantasy setting. This profession system is the Fantasy version of the modern occupation system. It fleshes out the things a character's profession skill stands for, and gives the character's life before she became an adventurer a little more meaning.<br/><br/>The occupations presented in this PDF include:<br/><br/>Academic Wizard<br/>Adventurer<br/>City Guard<br/>Clergy<br/>Farmer<br/>Hedge Wizard<br/>Hospitality Worker<br/>Noble<br/>Pickpocket<br/>Sailor<br/>Samanera <br/>Squire<br/>Troubadour<br/>And<br/>Woodsman<br/><br/>The second section of this PDF deals with Astrological signs and a way to introduce them into your campaign.<br/><br/>The sign under which a person was born can be very significant. The fact that practically every newspaper published in the US has a horoscope section speaks to the fact that even if we don't believe that the position of the stars effects us, we'd very much like to.<br/><br/>The mechanism for including astrology into your games is simple by design. Two moons, Luna and Io, travel through the thirteen zodiac houses. The moon Luna grants a minor bonus when it is in a character's house, and the moon Io bestows a minor penalty. Several methods of tracking the moon's location during a given adventure are also presented.<br/><br/>"}, "61174": {"rpg": {"524": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Mega-Feats: New Paths to Victory", "rpgproducer": {"15781": "Christopher A.

A collection of House Rules and updates tweaking the D20 SRD for Chris Field's campaing setting Aldura.<br/>-A FREE copy of the OGL included with every purchase! ;-)<br/><br/>From the Author:<br/><br/>Many of the feats presented here were initially designed for use in a homebrewed campaign world called Aldura. Aldura is a high tech action adventure, inspired heavily by 80s action cartoons, but the new feats presented here may be used in any high power, techno-fantasy campaign with little or no modification. Other rules are variant house rules I've used to good effect in my home campaigns, solving many problems and minor annoyances with the current D20 Fantasy SRD. The variant item creation feats would be a good fit for Ebberon adventurers, while high level fighters, druids, bards and barbarians will thrill to unique new abilities like Pocket Battlespace, Raging Colossus and Breeder.<br/><br/>Many of the higher-end feats presented here require an action point expenditure to use, and might require a bit of modification if your home campaign doesn't use action points. Adding an additional feat prerequisite, or requiring additional skill ranks go a long way to balancing these 'superheroic' feats without requiring a limited resource like action points for game balance.<br/><br/>The majority of the feats here were designed to provide better, more entertaining options for mid and high level players. Inspired by videogames, movies and everything from Greek mythology to Jack Kirby comics, these feats are designed to give every D&amp;D character class and archetype some neat new tricks to bring to next weeks game.<br/><br/>"}, "61175": {"rpgitemversion": {"15932": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Keys of Magic", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic855323.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"524": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic855323_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Singed, bloodied, and battered, the adventurers stare past the body of the fallen dragon, eager to begin ransacking its horde of treasure. Already, their eyes gleam, and their minds dance with the possibilities: piles of coins, heady thoughts of eldritch weapons, and the promise of a rune-encrusted tome. Unnoticed among these riches is a battered, once gleaming key, dangling by a leather thong from the hilt of a sword.<br/><br/>The key stands out because it is so common an item amongst such uncommon wealth. It was probably the property of some adventure with less luck than the now-victorious party, and opens nothing more interesting than an old strongbox; certainly nothing of merit when compared to the wealth sitting before them. So it will simply hang there, or perhaps be tossed into a pouch, with no one ever realizing that this innocuous key is the vessel for considerable magical power.<br/><br/>It is the very plainness and strong symbolic properties of keys that mark them as excellent choices for enchantments involving locks, passage and hidden entries; as well as less tangible forms of opening and opportunity.

In a fantasy setting, the underground complex of the tor could hide a band of goblins who've been attacking travelers. Perhaps a new cabal, followers of a multi-tentacled god, have made the abandoned tor their new base of operations in a pulp or modern setting.

Trapped between its sinister neighbours to the south in Ereworn and the ice-pack beyond the Mountains of Brack to the north, it is an unquiet place where the old ways are crashing head-on into the new. Outside the walls of Glissom City, the old ways hold. Reivers raid rural settlements, killing and pillaging, making honest trade impossible. Beyond their forts lie forests populated by elves, ruins left by the Selentine Empire a thousand years ago, and the mountains with their strange inhabitants. And in the north people still talk of the ancient Fomorians and their glass towers, and abandoned cities under the ice. It is a wild land, in need of strong leadership. But King Durindar has been seen only twice in two years. With the heir to the throne a reckless adventurer, many are saying that it is time for a change in Glissom. And a change is coming.<br/><br/><br/>Prince of Darkness combines source-material on the frozen northern kingdom of Glissom with a thrilling campaign in seven parts. Caught up in a scheme to steal the throne of Glissom, the adventurers must journey from the city northwards into the Mountains of Brack, to prevent a ritual that will awaken an ancient evil of hideous, world-changing power. Along the way they will befriend the true heir to the kingdom, and encounter Reivers, vampires, giants, forgotten gods, and bizarre monsters of many forms. Finally they must locate the Lost City of Nem, where the Darkness Elementalists conduct their most secret rites, and descend into its frozen depths to confront what lies below the ice.<br/><br/>Prince of Darkness is designed for a party of Dragon Warriors characters of ranks 5-7.

Sometimes also called Rainbow Magicians, they have the capacity to cast almost all spells available as arcane spells and advanced spell progression.<br/><br/>Binarist (Meld-Mage) For those that seek mastery of two colours simultaneously, a particular path of development is available (providing those colours are not opposed). They might learn to focus on two separate universal elements, and find ways to mesh them together to develop powerful spell abilities.<br/><br/>Monomancer (Coherence Mage) When a specialist chooses to align themselves to the principle of one colour absolutely, to the exclusion of all else, they might become a Monomancer. Such single mindedness has certain advantages, but also affects one?s perspective to some extent.<br/><br/>Prismatician (Diffraction Mage) The magic of Light has particular relevance to the nature of Colour, and as such it is possible that a Red mage might learn deeper secrets of arcane power through the creation and manipulation of light itself. Their learning gives them access to abilities that are less like spells and more akin to supernatural powers.<br/><br/>Pulsar (Oscillation Mage) Should a specialist learn that their focus on one chromatic element has made them blind to the opposite, they might seek a balance between the two opposing colours. This often results in fluctuations of ability, but eventually can end in a unique set of powers dependant upon which duality they attempt to bridge.<br/><br/>Ultramancer (UV Mage) The darker end of the spectrum contains many secrets and vast power. Those that master it might develop a kind of magic from the Shades that is different and yet related to the abilities that Grey Magicians utilise.

Historically, we have a tendancy to quantify black as evil. But imagine a universe where every colour has power, and each can be used by good or evil for their own aims and goals. What then would Black signify? For Black is a colour unlike any other: when you remove the light, it is what is left. Black is the absence of colour.<br/><br/>In such a universe, Black is the Absence of Magic, symbolizing normal matter, and normality itself, representing stability and resistance. Drawn from the Earth, Black Magic has the power of solid material to remain resilient against change and damage. It also holds the ability to oppose supernatural forces and even negate them. It is superlative protective magic, broader in scope than simple abjuration.<br/><br/>Occasionally there are those born with a strong connection to the Earth. This resonance can be developed into a powerful capability to evoke the Black, such that the Earth itself might answer the call of the Mage.

Celebrants for miles around will join the kananaukas of Kishkindha in celebrating the ancient triumph of the warrior maiden Sugri over their ogre slavemasters. The main attraction of the annual feast is the exotic and intoxicating beverage called Lotus Heron, brewed from a secret recipe of mangoes and spices by innkeeper Mathur and his family.

The only relief from the ocean of green is the road, maintained by the local authorities to ease travel, and the occasional pointed roof of a Shinto shrine. A few travelers are already making their way, trudging along muddy roads that have not yet been set with paving stones, checking to ensure their papers are in order for the border outposts that control traffic between the different feudal lands.<br/><br/>A lone wanderer wipes the morning dew off his thick traveling cloak and spots a small shrine on one side of the road. The man is not particularly religious, but he recognizes to whom the shrine is dedicated. Careful not to incite the wrath of the spirit of the shrine, the traveler stops to leave a small morsel as an offering at the paw of a stone statue of a fox. The man utters a short prayer before quickly walking away.<br/><br/>As soon as the traveler is out of view, the stone statue transforms into a real fox and eats the offering, twisting her four tails in the direction of the traveler to grant the man a small blessing as a way of thanks. The fox then scampers into the underbrush, planning her mischief for the day.<br/><br/>Kitsunemori is a self-contained setting that describes a specific area ? the Yonhosu Valley ? of an otherwise unspecified world. You can insert Kitsunemori into a larger, pre-existing world, expand the setting, or simply limit travel to the four lands detailed within Kitsunemori.<br/><br/>The kitsune themselves were obviously the main inspiration for this book. They are intriguing creatures featured in many Japanese folktales as well as in actual history, and they have been reinterpreted in various ways in modern popular media. Kitsune are bringers of mischief and misery, and so many people are quick to classify them as demons.<br/><br/>But kitsune are also messengers of the god Inari, patron of rice, life, and fertility, and are thus also benevolent beings. In both conceptions, kitsune are described as playful, cunning, charming, and utterly dangerous.<br/><br/>Other staples of Japanese myth included in Kitsunemori are the tanuki, tengu, and kappa, as well as the evil oni and the ambiguous bakemono. In many instances,monster descriptions deviate from those found in traditional folklore; these monsters are presented as fantasy races and as creatures inspired by Japanese folklore rather than strict re-creations. Shinto mingles with Buddhism to create a cosmological backdrop for the setting, but a thorough knowledge of either is not necessary.<br/><br/>Another inspiration for Kitsunemori was the chambara genre as represented in comics and animation, which features heroic samurai and masterless ronin bravely crossing swords for the sake of honor.<br/><br/>"}, "61356": {"rpgitemversion": {"16136": "First Printing"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Wendigo Tribebook (1st Edition)", "rpgproducer": {"12030": "Pauline Benney"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic673219.jpg", "usersrated": "8", "rpgsetting": {"2591": "World of Darkness (cWoD Modern)"}, "average": "5.375", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"441": "Horror (Supernatural)"}, "rpg": {"370": "Werewolf: The Apocalypse"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"1488": "Tribebooks (oWoD)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic673219_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary: Tribe book covering the secretive and reclusive Wendigo.

His end result gives DMs exactly what they need, including both general advice and specific content. I&rsquo;ve been mixing elements of Arcana Evolved into my Ptolus Campaign for years, so I know it can be a fun and rewarding experience. Thanks, S&oslash;ren. &mdash; Monte<br/><br/>"}, "61436": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Montreal Expos Control Action Baseball Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "1972", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"5586": "Sports: Baseball"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic601933_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1139": {"name": "Coleco Industries, Inc."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic601933.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"281366": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This game was produced by COLECO World Sports games and is reminiscent of the old time electronic games where vibration made players move after a hit ball.
