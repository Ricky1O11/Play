When you challenge the card in front of you it is revealed. You have to then battle that card to clear that forest space. You have to decide how many of your attack dice to use.

When you are in the air, the Air half of the ship (pink player) will control where the ship will fly, the Water half of the ship (blue player) will take control over the shooting and other interactive elements. When you fly into water, the controls swap and the blue player takes control over flight and the pink player takes control over shooting and other interactive elements.<br/><br/>Once you have the basic controls figured out, you will then have to destroy the mysterious creatures that have invaded your world. Some will be chilling around the landscape waiting to spit deadly poison at you as you fly past, others will be messing with the poor friendly creatures of the world causing them to block your path, and even turn them bad! To destroy the enemies, you will have to pay attention to the colour of their eyes. They will either be pink or blue or both!. You may have noticed by this point that you each have different coloured bullets, pink and blue. This directly relates to who can shoot the enemy to destroy it.<br/><br/>These are the foundations on which we are going to build this game on. We hope that this will be a game that will make players communicate with each other, to work together, and have fun doing so.<br/><br/>We are working our darnedest to release 'The Incredible Journey of You and I' in 2016/17.

The player (as CEO of this vast corporate empire), appoints consuls and governors, raises taxes, deploys legions, fleets and auxiliaries to garrison provinces, and fights wars to expand the prestige and power of Rome. The map consists of provinces grouped into military commands such as Britannia, Germania and Syria each commanded by a governor. Provinces may be controlled by barbarians, allies or insurgents, which can be conquered and developed into peaceful tax-payers. Beyond these are the homelands from where barbarian wars and enemy leaders pillage their way from province to province until defeated. There are four scenarios starting in 27 BCE, 70 CE, 138 CE and 212 CE, which may combined into campaign games. Each turn represented 8-10 years, with eight turns in each scenario, which take 3-4 hours to play.<br/><br/>Historical statesmen are rated for their military and administrative talents, popularity, and skill at intrigue (or lack thereof), and each has a special ability. For example Augustus is rated as 2 for military, 5 for administration, 5 for popularity and 3 for intrigue and has the Conquest special ability. This makes him excellent at collecting taxes, increasing prestige and keeping the mob happy, but a poor general even though Conquest allows him to annex an extra province every turn and after every triumph. A showman like Nero is rated as 1 for military, 2 for administration, 4 for popularity, and 5 for intrigue and his Persecution ability reduces prestige as long as he is Caesar. Players may use him to reduce unrest with his showmanship, or plot to remove him for the greater good of Rome (&quot;the biz&quot;).<br/><br/>Governors are used to fight wars, expand the empire, and develop provinces, but may make themselves Caesar through assassination or rebellion. New imperial dynasties change the rules of the game, provide new units, and determines who will succeed when Caesar dies. Each turn produces a new crisis and the player, much like a modern CEO, earns victory points by expanding the empire and triumphing over wars and rebels, deciding where allocate his resources (capital spending), raise new forces (hiring), undertaking prestige projects (public relations), pleasing the mob (&quot;the shareholders&quot;), or even set aside a reserve for a rainy decade or two. Annexing the rich provinces of the east will increase taxes, but securing the northern frontier may be more important. Placing a popular, competent general in command may result in a triumph, but encourage rebellion. A more loyal, but less able man may be better, or for Caesar to risk himself on the field of battle himself.<br/><br/>"}, "196677": {"rpgitemversion": {"305971": "2016 Reprint"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Cthulhu Reisekarte Deutschland 1927", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"310": "Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "rpgseries": {"34680": "Gratisrollenspieltag 2016"}, "rpggenre": {"173": "Generic / Universal"}, "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>A period map of Germany for use with Cthulhu.<br/><br/>Distributed on Gratisrollenspieltag 2016.<br/><br/>"}, "196678": {"rpgitemversion": {"305972": "First German Printing"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Cthulhu Berge des Wahnsinns Deluxe Character Sheet", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"310": "Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "rpgseries": {"34680": "Gratisrollenspieltag 2016"}, "rpggenre": {"988": "Horror (Cthulhu Mythos)"}, "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>A character sheet for Cthulhu's Berge des Wahnsinns camapign, released on Gratisrollenspieltag 2016.<br/><br/>"}, "196679": {"statistics": {}, "name": "OFF", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"305974": "OFF"}, "average": "6.5", "videogametheme": {"2265": "Horror"}, "usersrated": "2", "videogamegenre": {"2155": "RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "In OFF you take control of a mysterious person called &quot;The Batter&quot;, who is on an important mission.

Asymmetrical co-op allows one player to take the role of the spy while a friend provides overwatch and assistance as the hacker, and unravel a post-Cold War espionage conspiracy.<br/><br/>The year is 1996, five years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. A string of accidents and murders gone mostly unnoticed by the public eye have put the world of international espionage on high alert &ndash; veteran Cold War operatives from both sides of the former Iron Curtain are being assassinated around the globe. High-ranking officials of the CIA and the FSB secretly establish a joint task force to investigate the leaks. Codenamed The Kingbridge Executive, the group is funded with whatever money could be skimmed off of official projects and staffed by whoever could be spared from official operations. As field operative Katya Kozlova or hacker Martin Symborski, you will be deployed on dangerous missions across Europe and North America, chasing the source of the leaks.<br/><br/>Key Features<br/><br/>Single Player &amp; Asymmetrical co-op: Play as the spy while a friend guides you through the missions or take on the role of the hacker to crack infrastructure and defeat security systems.<br/><br/>A return to hard-core stealth games where the enemies are lethal and combat is unforgiving.<br/><br/>A deep hacking system built around core stealth game mechanics, rife with options to manipulate the game world and mess with your enemies.<br/><br/>Use social engineering in cooperative dialogue sequences to bypass security checkpoints and gain entry to restricted areas.<br/><br/>Your actions won&rsquo;t go unnoticed &ndash; the story will respond to how much evidence you leave in each mission and how many dead bodies you leave in your wake.<br/><br/>Playing as the Spy<br/><br/>The role of the Spy will be familiar to fans of stealth/action games. As the Spy, you will experience Clandestine as a 3rd person game, controlling the movements and actions of Katya in the game world. Katya is the boots on the ground, armed with weapons and gadgets that you can use to stay alive and evade your opponents. Katya is also well trained in hand-to-hand combat, and can use lethal or non-lethal stealth takedowns to take down enemies, leaving behind as little evidence as possible. During the mission, it also falls to the Spy to search for dossiers and intel to unlock new equipment and software for subsequent missions.<br/><br/>Playing as the Hacker<br/><br/>Martin operates in an entirely different way than the spy, which is reflected in the hacker player&rsquo;s interface and game mechanics. As the Hacker, players have access to four game windows and a toolbar. These game windows are: the Camera Feed, the Console, the Network View, and the Tactical Map.<br/><br/>Camera Feed<br/><br/>The Camera Feed allows the hacker to observe the game world and scout ahead for the Spy. By default, the Camera Feed displays the Operative Camera (a hidden camera worn by Katya), but you can also jump into surveillance cameras on the Tactical Map (see below) to look through them and scout the levels for enemies and other threats. The Camera Feed also displays the status of the Spy&rsquo;s health.<br/><br/>Console<br/><br/>The Console always displays game Objectives at the top of the window and prints important information in the Message Log such as cracked keypad codes. You can also use it to communicate with the Spy via the in-game text chat.<br/><br/>Network View<br/><br/>The Network View window is where Hackers can access the computer network(s) which run all of the electronic infrastructure in the mission area. This includes door keypads, PCs, Servers, Firewalls, and Hazards (steam pipes and electrical boxes which can be triggered to cause &ldquo;accidents&rdquo;). Hackers must be mindful of the Network Admin, an enemy AI which searches for changes in the Network and tries to correct them.

Conversion Go is a territory game for two players, Black and White, who alternately put stones of their color on the board.<br/><br/>2. The board is a 16x16 grid (counting the points rather than the squares). At the beginning the board is empty, with play taking place on the points.<br/><br/><br/>Play<br/><br/>3. A corner point is considered to belong to both edges that meet there.<br/><br/>4. It is permissible to pass. If both players pass consecutively, the game concludes.<br/><br/>5. It is not permissible to &quot;mirror&quot; the opponent's moves ten or more turns in succession.<br/><br/>6. The beginning of the game is governed by a &quot;refined&quot; pie rule. Player 1 plays two moves for Black and one move for White. One or more of those moves can be passes. Player 2 then decides which side to take, with White to move.<br/><br/>7. A group is a set of one or more like-colored, orthogonally adjacent stones. A liberty of a group is an empty point orthogonally adjacent to it. A dead group is a group that has no liberties and touches less than two sides of the board. To convert a group means to remove it from the board and replace it with stones of the opposite color. After a player's move, first all dead groups of the opponent's color are converted, then all dead groups of the player's color in the resulting position are converted.<br/><br/>8. The game concludes when both players pass consecutively. Any stones that cannot escape conversion are now automatically converted. Each player then figures his score, which is the number of his stones on the board plus the territory (vacant points) they surround.<br/><br/><br/>Notes<br/><br/>Despite the fact that stones are converted and re-converted, the game can be played neatly with pen-and-paper. The reason is that the color of any &quot;X&quot;ed stones is always clear: it is the color of the living formation which ultimately encloses them.<br/><br/>If played on an odd-sized board by players trying to win, the game will never end in a tie. Oddly enough, this is possible thanks to the fact that suicide moves are allowed as this prevents local impasses (&quot;seki&quot;) with an odd number of points in them.<br/><br/>"}, "196834": {"boardgamedesigner": {"10706": {"name": "Jim Keifer"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "You Bet Your Ass", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2073": "Acting"}, "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3062585_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"209": {"name": "Patch Products"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3062585.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"306279": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "age": "17", "minplaytime": "25", "description": "Adult icebreaker/party game where one player picks a true/false statement off a card and reads it aloud (example, &quot;I have played strip poker,&quot; or &quot;I have baked pot brownies.)

Head to the sea and cross the ocean to find your new home.<br/><br/>Tiki Island is best described as a light strategy game with some...interesting elements thrown in.  The goal is simple; get from one side of the ocean to the other.  The only problem is that everyone else is trying to do the same, and the vast ocean is only so big.<br/><br/>Use your magical Tiki to build an island chain from one side of the map to the other.  Try to avoid the other players, because along with the ability to build new islands, Tikis can hurl powerful runes and utilize devastating combinations to keep you from reaching your goal.  Are you going to try for the tortoise or the hare approach?  A complete path makes a world of difference...but then again, so does a well timed lightning bolt!<br/><br/>Using simple and intuitive strategy, Tiki Island was designed from the ground up to be a family experience.<br/><br/>"}, "196874": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Civil War: Pea Ridge", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"306331": "iOS download edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2345": "Historical"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2156": "Simulation"}, "videogameplatform": {"4443": "iPhone"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Pea Ridge is based on the board game of the same name and is part of the &lsquo;Great Battles of the American Civil War&rsquo; series of games, recreating the significant battles of the American Civil War.<br/><br/>The battle of Pea Ridge took place on 7th March, 1862.

They did happen, and they happened often, but they never matched the scale of the Western Theatre. Starting in China in the 1930&rsquo;s the Chinese engaged the Japanese using Russian T26&rsquo;s and German Panzer I&rsquo;s. The Japanese fought the Russians in 1939 and 1945, the Soviets with the one of the world&rsquo;s greatest generals, Zhukov, in command! In 1941 the French in Vietnam briefly fought the Japanese with World War One era tanks. In Burma and India, British Commonwealth forces regularly engaged in battle using equipment that would have been considered obsolete on the West Front. Finally the titanic struggle between the Japanese and United States of American resulted in dozens of tank engagements. Even the Island War battles saw some engagements with over 30 Japanese tanks in a single mass assault. Tank Battle: Pacific attempts to create many of these battles with a mixture of historical battles and themed scenarios that capture the experience of being a tank commander in the Pacific Theatre in World War Two. Fight battles between Japan, France, China, Russia, British Commonwealth and The United States of America. The game has a wide range of features from the tank battles of Northern Manchuria to the battlefields of Burma and the landings on the Pacific Islands. The game even includes a what-if scenario for Operation Olympic, the invasion of the Japanese homelands.

Even before the town blew and the portals began to open, the gold rush and Dark Stone rush that grew the town out of control also lured in Outlaws and bandits by the thousands. Once the devastation occurred and the Darkness came, countless numbers of those Outlaws fell into shadow. Some became Mutants, other fell to the curse of the Lycan or began dabbling into dark Magiks, and many more began to rise from the grave as Undead. It wasn't long before the Undead Outlaws fell back into their old ways of robbing, rustling, and mayhem. Perhaps it was just faint memories of their old lives seeping back in, or maybe they have a cold purpose, with a mind for revenge on the land of the living.<br/><br/>The most famous of all is a dark, rotting figure known only as The Undead Gunslinger. Whoever he was in life, no one can say for sure. But in death, he has become the most cold killer in the land, earning the nickname of the 'Fastest Dead in the West'. He travels the roads and shadows, challenging any who cross his path to a duel. Few survive to tell the tale.

Aliens: Insectron The basis for all Insectron &lsquo;life&rsquo; are two substances believed to be based on highly advanced nanomachines. The first substance, labelled &lsquo;Xenoaqua&rsquo;, is a quicksilver like substance which hardens to create Insectron structures and armour. It is highly adaptable and will self-repair by absorbing more liquid Xenoaqua. The second substance is &lsquo;Xenophy&rsquo;, a purple liquid, said to have the consistency of thick syrup. Xenophy is thought to be the &lsquo;brains&rsquo; inside the Insectron machines and the most vulnerable to damage. It is unknown if the Insectron think with a&rsquo; hivemind&rsquo; or if they feel individuality, but both there is evidence to support both claims. The Insectrons follow a pack mentality to the point they seem to share their perceptions on the battlefield almost instantaneously, they also display fear and self-survival when in danger. Martians: The Holy Gravidus Republic (HGR) Humans first settled on Mars midway into the 22nd century. Isolated for hundreds of years, the Colony on Mars grew into a religious order. While Earth burned for decades, the Insectron horde sent a much smaller force to occupy Mars; and while the Martians and Insectrons clashed, the Martian people were left relatively unhindered in their progress. Waiting for the perfect moment, the HTR have unleashed the full potential of their technology, wiping aside the Insectron occupation force.

In this game you will control one of these nations and either fight for the continued sovereignty of Georgia or attempt to reclaim lost territory and remake the Soviet Block. Crisis in the Caucasus is a 1-2 player Hex and Counter wargame that plays anywhere from 90mins-120mins. There are two scenarios featured in the game one that is the historical conflict between these two nations in 2008 and a hypothetical campaign that occurs in the near future, a conflict that could have potential major repercussions for the world and plunge us into World War 3.<br/><br/>The gameplay is fast and uses a pretty innovative damage allocation system. The game plays smooth with the turn allowing both players phases to be able to move units and react to the other players offensives or crush an enemy strongpoint in a combine assault. In the historical scenario the Georgians will be trying to make an assault on the break away province of South Ossetia's vital city before the intervention of the Russian military pours into south Ossetia and puts the Georgians on the defensive. In the hypothetical scenario the game starts off the same but at the beginning of each new turn the initiative player rolls on the event table to see if there is Nato intervention or CSTO intervention, if Azerbaijan joins the fight for the Georgians and how many militia units get spawn in South Ossetia. This allows the player to see what would have happened had nato gotten involved and tried to stop the take over of a prospective nato member.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"305714": "First edition"}, "age": "14", "name": "Crisis in the Caucasus: The Russo-Georgian War", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "average": "6", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": {"35746": "Modern Crisis Series"}}, "196518": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Catlateral Damage", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"305717": "Lixux Downloadable edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3441207.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2471": "Animals"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "videogamegenre": {"2156": "Simulation"}, "videogameplatform": {"5248": "Linux"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3441207_t.jpg", "description": "Catlateral Damage is a first-person destructive cat simulator where you play as a cat on a rampage, knocking as much stuff onto the ground as possible.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "196519": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2952643.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"90038": {"name": "Jez Fairclough"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2007", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"29106": "Adrian Walters"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"32217": {"name": "Lupus Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2952643_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1047": {"name": "Miniatures"}}, "description": "From the designer:<br/><br/>A &quot;Kashindan&quot; (\u58eb\u696d\u611b) was a feudal Japanese Daimyo's band of retainers, something similar to a small elite company or a unit of faithful bodyguards. Consequently, Kashindan is not a game for mass battles, but was designed to play skirmish fights in an hour, in which the loyal vassals of a hero fight each other for fame, honour, prestige, personal feuds or because they favour opposite sides in a larger political/military confrontation. From the lowest peasants to the most prestigious Samurai lords -- the composition of an army depends only on the hero's capabilities to convince and inspire followers, i.e. it is entirely up to the player's tactical decisions.<br/><br/>Kashindan takes place in feudal Japan before a Portuguese ship stranded off the Japanese coast in 1543 and introduced the people of Nippon to the Arquebus (gun). During those times, honour meant a lot to &laquo;the ones who serve&raquo; (Samurai) and warriors would often ride up to the enemy ranks before a battle, challenging a worthy opponent to a duel. Duels could also be fought by appointment or over the smallest of insults. It was a time when life could come to an end very suddenly, be it by disease, famine or war, and this uncertainty partially shaped the attitude towards death and an honourable way to face it. Nevertheless, it was also a period during which social barriers were not yet as fixed and impenetrable as Toyotomi Hideyoshi would make them by the end of the 16th century -- an ambitious, driven man with some loyal retainers could conquer a province or even forge an empire.<br/><br/>The game does not require a lot of miniature figures, dice, rule books and expansions. To get started, 10-50 Ashigaru, Ninja, Peasants, Samurai and Sohei to represent a hero's Kashindan, about 10 six-sided dice (D6) and the aforementioned rules and game accessories are enough to drench your Katanas (Japanese swords) in blood. The army creation process allows a wide variety of styles to be played and the opportunity to adapt the commander to a player's personal style, whether you prefer to shoot arrows from a distance or to wield a Naginata in close combat. Although the author had the Heian/Kamakura period from 1000-1300 AD in mind, figures from up to the Sengoku Jidai (warring states) era should work as well with some historic laxity, as long as no firearms or face masks with beards are used.<br/><br/>The game was written by a gamer for gamers, and while the use of a turn deck may not be unheard of, a small random factor and not always being able to move all figures add a level of tactics that offers challenges similar to the unforeseen influences that affect the outcome of every battle in real life. The game mechanics are deliberately kept reasonably simple to allow both new and veteran players alike to get into the game quickly. Not having to read through half a dozen Warhammer tomes means that scenarios can be played in different ways to allow for the improvement of one's approach or a revanche after switching sides within a reasonable amount of time, usually around an hour.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"305720": "First edition"}, "age": "12", "name": "Kashindan", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "average": "8", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"28732": "Samurai"}}, "196520": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Devils Share", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"305721": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2265": "Horror"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2161": "Action Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Take on the role of Victor Locke, a mercenary hired by the church to clean out the filth that has begun plaguing the lands.<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "196521": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Shake Your Money Simulator 2016", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"305722": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2277": "Adult / Mature"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2156": "Simulation"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A money-spending simulator where you use your large money supply to spend as much money as you can on whoever/whatever is shaking their money-maker at you.<br/><br/>"}, "196522": {"boardgamedesigner": {"90039": {"name": "Colin Dillard"}}, "average": "4.9", "poll": {}, "name": "King's Cloak", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2951508_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"90039": "Colin Dillard"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2456": {"name": "The Game Crafter, LLC"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2951508.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"305723": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Welcome to the royal court!

Each player constructs a cloak from 15 cards over the course of the game. Playing adjacent cards of the same suit gives a multiplicative score bonus. At the end, the player with the highest-scoring cloak wins!<br/><br/>A unique mechanic, the &quot;King's Favor&quot;, allows a player to steal a card from the other tailors.  However, once used, the Favor passes to the player whose card was stolen, to compensate their loss.<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with four cards and discards one, in secret, out of the game. On your turn, you both draw a card from the deck and receive a card from the prior player. The first player takes one fewer card on their first turn, but begins the game with the King's Favor, which allows them to steal a card from another player.<br/><br/>Each turn you must choose one card from your hand to sew into your cloak in one of 15 locations, connected to an already-sewn piece of cloth. Strategic placement of cards and careful hand management are the keys to success. Adjacent cards of the same suit multiply their values, whereas adjacent cards of different suits sum their values. You must watch out for the special cuts of cloth with negative values, however. They will boost your score if you place them next to each other, turning the negative values positive, but decrease your score if you don't plan carefully.<br/><br/>After sewing a card into your cloak, you pass a different card than the one you received on to the next player. You'll want to try to keep the best cards for yourself and also avoid passing cards that will help the player after you. Similarly, you'll want to avoid helping the player with the King's Favor, who can steal the card you pass out of turn. But beware, you may not always have the option to avoid helping your opponents.<br/><br/>The game ends when all players have completed their cloaks.  Scoring is conducted by multiplying values of adjacent cards of the same suit and summing the results.

You choose a variety of coffee beans you want to roast, and put a number of tokens specific to that variety into a bag. Each turn, you draw a number of bean tokens randomly from the bag to advance their roast level. When you are finished, you make a cup-testing to check the taste of your coffee and score points accordingly. Each variety has its own target roast level, but approaching the target is not enough for perfect roasting; you also have to even out the roast level of each bean, while not spoiling the flavor of that variety.<br/><br/>You also have to screen out smoke tokens and burnt bean tokens that hinder your roasting, and reject bean tokens that spoil the taste. It is important to control the contents of your bag utilizing flavor effects and unique effects caused by placing tokens on the roast board.<br/><br/>There are 22 varieties of beans in the game. In one game, you try to roast three of them, and your roaster title is awarded based on the total score.
