According to game designer and aficionado Dan Glimne it is reputed to date back to Roman times; be that as it may, it could be a precursor to number matching dice games such as Shut the Box.<br/><br/>Two or more players can participate, each one writing down a progression of numbers from 1 to 12 and then from 12 back down to 1. On their turn, a player rolls three dice and then crosses off as many numbers as possible, typically in order, by matching them to the numbers on the dice or sums that these add up to. E.g. a first-turn roll of 6-1-1 would allow crossing off the numbers 1 and 2, and a lucky roll of 4-2-1 would mean crossing off every number from 1 to 7. Rerolls may be allowed as long as at least one number was crossed out on the previous roll, except after scoring the first 12. The first player to reach the end of their sequence is the winner.<br/><br/>Variations concern for instance restrictions on the order in which numbers may be crossed out; restrictions on the use of dice; whether there are two 12 spaces or just one; and whether and how re-rolls are used. If numbers can only be crossed out in strict order, player advancement can be recorded using individual tokens on a single path of numbered spaces.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"226769": "Public domain edition"}, "name": "Martinetti", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "2.4375", "usersrated": "4", "age": "0"}, "151558": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Magicka: Dungeons & Daemons", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"226770": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "average": "7", "videogameseries": {"25287": "Magicka"}, "videogametheme": {"2509": "Comedy"}, "usersrated": "2", "videogameexpansion": {"91698": "Magicka"}, "videogamegenre": {"2161": "Action Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Something stirs beneath Castle Aldrheim&hellip;<br/>Deep in the sub-dungeons, long forgotten by the Wizards, the demented<br/>ancestors of the Aldrheim Order have awoken an ancient evil.

More than a just simple conversion to the new rule set, these short sourcebooks imagine how heroes from super-scientific worlds would look in campaigns where magic and the divine are the norm. This series of supplements also provides a few new hints at how the vast and interconnected multiverse of Otherverse Games fits together.<br/><br/>In Galaxy Command, the powerfully built Urloks are an alien race of psychically enhanced warriors. They are known for their courage and sense of honor. The bear like humanoids have recently entered the galactic stage, after a successful first contact by Galaxy Command's heroic astronauts.<br/><br/>For the Pathfinder Role Playing Game the Urlocks have been re-imagined...<br/><br/>According to the Urlok's own creation stories, the bear-like giants fell from heaven long ago. Otherworldly and somber, Urloks know the Prime Material Plane as a cosmic penance for racial sins long forgotten. Talk to any Urlok and if you can over come the race's legendary taciturnity, he will tell you that once upon a time, his race were the soldiers of Heaven itself. During a great battle against a legendary cosmic evil, Urlok soldiers fled the battlefield, and for their cowardice the entire race was cast down. Urloks strive to atone for their mythical ancestors' betrayal.<br/><br/>Courage and loyalty are foremost virtues for the race, and an Urlok knight would rather die than betray a trust. Oathbreakers and cowards are punished harshly, with the normally noble bear-men reaching extremes of torture and atrocity that give even savage humanoids like Orcs and Hobgoblins pause when punishing traitors within their proud race. Urloks who show fear or even the slightest trace of deception brand and scar themselves with their mightly claws. More severe offenses are punished with the amputation of fingers, hands or even whole arms. Urloks hold themselves to incredibly harsh standards and a completely unscarred Urlok is a one in a million rarity. Among their own kind, the rare unscarred Urloks are treated with a living saint's respect, and a bit of jealous suspicion: are they truly as righteous as they claim, or are they simply too afraid of pain to scar themselves for hidden offenses?<br/><br/>Urloks live far from most other humanoids. They prefer the cold places at the top and bottom of the world. Because of their distance from civilization and their savage and masochistic punishments, the Urloks rarely receive a warm reception in peaceful humanoid kingdoms.

More than a just simple conversion to the new rule set, these short sourcebooks imagine how heroes from super-scientific worlds would look in campaigns where magic and the divine are the norm. This series of supplements also provides a few new hints at how the vast and interconnected multiverse of Otherverse Games fits together.<br/><br/>In Otherverse America, the Ubasti are a small species of genetically engineered lions which willingly serve the Choicer's Coven of Bast. Created as military working animals, Ubasti proved smarter than anyone expected. As soon as their sentience was discovered, the Ubasti were freed. As of 2107, the Ubasti work with the Choicer nation as free sentient beings, and are beloved by Choicer America for their loyalty and courage.<br/><br/>For the Pathfinder setting the Ubasti have been re-imagined as nomadic, long-lived sentient lion-folk. Ubasti prides have prowled the veldt since before the bipedal races began recording history. Collectively, the Ubasti are ancient beyond imagining, with the race's rich oral history acting as their memory and conscience.<br/><br/>This release gives you everything you need to add the Ubasti to your game as a player race.  Also included is a short history of the Ubasti, their pantheon, new feats specifically designed for these four-legged warriors and more!<br/><br/>"}, "151592": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Necropunk: Welshen", "rpgproducer": {"50693": "Scott Gladstein"}, "usersrated": "0", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2261987.jpg", "rpgitemversion": {"226822": "PDF version"}, "rpgsetting": {"25974": "Necropunk"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"168": "Fantasy (Science Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2261987_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Sentinels to the front, Necromancers to the back and today's shaping up to be a good day to be a welshen!<br/><br/>Grab your war knife, dodge some bullets, and get to killing because this book's for all the Welshen players out there!<br/><br/>We've got 40+ pages of welshen goodness crammed into this book (quite efficiently I might add).<br/><br/>We've got archetypes, prestige classes, weapons, feats, and all the lore for you next Necropunk game!<br/><br/>Included:<br/><br/>     5 Archetypes<br/>         h&rsquo;Devvel: An artistic society role that keeps the Empire from losing perspective. It's a wild card archetype that plays a bit like a bard, a bit like a diplomat, and a lot like a welshen!<br/>         Masque: A magdaline welshen diplomat archetype that focuses on extreme emotional control and hyper-rationality. It's a small archetype but it gives you new options for your moral support class feature and can make things more thematically appropriate for a magdaline.<br/>         h&rsquo;Teach: A master scavenger from the magdavuul. This book includes a new use for Appraise and they are masters at it. This diplomat archetype includes a lot of tech related things so you can blend the engineer in with it.<br/>         Rek'el: The flip side of the h'teach is the rek'el. They are a magdavuul engineer archetype who can scrap things and rebuild better things from the salvage. They also get less progresses but get the ability to switch them out.<br/>         h&rsquo;Vuul: We did a ranger archetype for the magdavuul's spec. ops commandos. They gain the ability to go higher in phase order and have some other very unique mechanics I don't want to spoil! (Plus a new weapon style for welshen rangers)<br/>    <br/>     2 Prestige Classes<br/>         Hn&rsquo;ist Nomad: Though bizarre chanting and adherence to an almost Zen philosophy the Hn&rsquo;ist gains a unique ability to suppress things like phase order abilities, psionic powers, and magpie abilities.<br/>         h'Te'shen (Master Qu&rsquo;em): This provides a high level prestige class option for the qu'em. It gives them more of a support role while not necessarily sacrificing their role as damage dealers.<br/>    <br/>     Lesser Clans<br/>         Clan X&rsquo;el: Ex-prime bloodline members who have joined the welshen.<br/>         Clan Mac&rsquo;Bel: Historians looking to head back to earth who have invented a predictive method that is said to be 92% accurate.<br/>         Clan Fe&rsquo;Shex: Murderous war mongers who taught the welshen to fight originally. Their punishingly brutal fau quan style of martial arts is believed to have influenced qu'em's development.<br/>         Clan Dem&rsquo;Rel: A diseased clan who are carriers of the deadly &quot;dem'rel fever&quot;. Used as biological weapons of war, they live their lives in isolation, and protective hazmat suits.<br/>         Clan Sil'van: A peaceful clan of Buddhist pacifists who swear not to draw blood even while they wear a welshen war knife in their sash...<br/>    <br/>     Qu'em Schools (Archetypes)<br/>         School of the Sil'van: Unable to cause harm, these qu'em practice a modified form of the art that leads to less-lethal conflict resolution.<br/>         School of the Golden Lion: A brutal style of armored qu'em that the fe'shex and magdaline are known to use.<br/>         School of the Crying Birds (Le&rsquo;Sara Qu&rsquo;em): A two weapon style of qu'em that blends elements from the artistic h&rsquo;Devvel that developed it.<br/>    <br/>     Sections on Welshen Culture: We include sections on topics like death, welshen women, economics, homefleets, honor duels, and give further explanation for welshen weapon taboos. We also touch on renegade qu'em and explore the mysteries of the origin of the welshen on Earth...<br/>     How to Build Clan Member: We have a guide on how to build members of each clan (from the t'ka main clan to the lesser clans).<br/>     20+ New Feats: Including combat, social, and style feats. Also, 3 campaign traits.<br/>     New Welshen Weapons: 5 new weapons (including a guns?!) and 6 new pieces of necrotech (some war tokens too).<br/>     New Use for Appraise: Allowing you to identify weapon mods and other aspects of gear!<br/>     Qu&rsquo;em Sojourns: Similar to story feats, qu'em can undertake these role-playing intense journeys of discovery to explore aspects of the qu'em lifestyle. They have an extremely strict initial requirement that looses up if you survive and provides you with a bonus!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "151593": {"rpgitemversion": {"226824": "PDF version"}, "rpgseries": {"14605": "Player's Options"}, "name": "Halflings", "rpgproducer": {"31280": "Connie J.

Each player has 6 dice and starts with 5 cards in their hand.  There are two types cards, dice cards and leprechaun cards.  The dice cards have combinations that each player must roll in order to obtain coins, such as 2 pair of a run of 4.  More coins are received if the player rolls dice combinations in one roll instead of having to roll additional times in order to obtain the desired combination.  Upon completing a dice card the player will place this card face up in front of them.  The game ends when any player completes 5 dice cards.  The first player to complete 5 dice cards also gets a bonus which makes it advantageous to complete dice cards the quickest.

The Woodbury Expansion now allows up to five players to play at once and offers an alternate win condition.<br/><br/>The Woodbury Location is added to the standard game set-up by placing it adjacent to two of the four starting Location tiles. Survivors sneaking into Woodbury can take their chances with the Woodbury Resource deck there. These cards have big highs and devastating lows. Examples include: Seduced, Assault Rifle, Enter the Arena, and Bargaining Chip. However, as a well-maintained and protected enclave, the good stuff outweighs the bad &mdash; and there aren't very many Walkers to deal with there!<br/><br/>Alternate Victory Condition: If your team of Survivors can draw up all of the Woodbury cards or find other ways to deplete the entire Woodbury deck, the Survivors win the game! The Woodbury deck begins the game with five cards per Survivor (plus a base five cards), so it's a well-balanced objective no matter how many Survivors there are.<br/><br/>Watching over everything is The Governor. Armed with his heavy Assault Rifle, he moves around the board causing all sorts of problems for the Survivors. However, with careful planning and some risk management, crafty players can get The Governor to help clean up pockets of Walkers. Just don't get too close to him when the bullets start flying, or you might get caught in the crossfire!<br/><br/>The Governor is an automated game piece on the board that moves to a new Location each round and creates plenty of panic. Alternately, the expansion provides a new &quot;Versus Mode&quot; where one player takes on the role of The Governor and works against all of the Survivors! The Survivor players must now win the game as a team or else The Governor player wins it all for himself. Instead of using automated or randomized movement, a player in control of The Governor can move at his own discretion, turning The Walking Dead Board Game: The Best Defense into a five-player game!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"226880": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.094", "name": "The Walking Dead Board Game: The Best Defense \u2013 Woodbury Expansion", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "age": "15", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "50", "expands": {"140638": {"name": "The Walking Dead Board Game: The Best Defense"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"27069": "Movies: The Walking Dead"}}, "151637": {"rpgitemversion": {"226882": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "World Metahuman Factbook: Germany", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1867247.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"198": "4C System"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpggenre": {"171": "Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1867247_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>Superhumans for 4CS<br/><br/>"}, "151638": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Pathways (Issue 33 - Dec 2013)", "rpgproducer": {"45951": "David Paul"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1856719.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"9834": "Pathways"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"113636": "Anti-Paladin Spell List for 1001 Spells"}, "rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "rpgissueversion": {"226883": "PDF"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1856719_t.png", "description": "Pathways<br/>Issue #33<br/>December 2013<br/><br/>Cover by Nick Russell<br/><br/>"}, "151639": {"boardgamedesigner": {"72266": {"name": "Shawn Pierre"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "These French Fries Are Terrible Hot Dogs", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "11", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}, "maxplayers": "99", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2012750_t.png", "average": "4.72727", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"27250": {"name": "OriGaminc"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2012750.png", "boardgameversion": {"226884": "English first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "These French Fries Are Terrible Hot Dogs is a party card game where players must lie to tell the truth, and convince others that their card is something else, more specifically, cards drawn by other people.

It is designed to bring Austen admirers together to share in her stories, characters, wit and language. While playing, each participant enters Jane&rsquo;s world as one of her heroines. As such, you seek after a fortunate life by becoming an accomplished woman, gaining societal experience and choosing to marry or not. Through chance, expertise and choice you could become the envied Mrs. Darcy, the pitied Mrs. Collins or the new roommate of Miss Bates.<br/><br/>The Jane Game is for 2-7 players (Austen wrote seven heroines into her six novels) and lasts about an hour to an hour and a half, depending on how chatty and good-humored the heroines are.<br/><br/>The overall objective is to obtain the greatest Life Fortune. This can be done by trading your accomplishment cards in for something of greater value. The player with the most Life Fortune is the winner.<br/><br/><br/>Designer's Summary:<br/><br/>The Jane Game is a mixture between a role-playing and trivia game. Each player becomes one of Jane Austen&rsquo;s heroines seeking after a fortunate life. This fortunate life is best achieved by becoming an accomplished lady, a societal woman and by marrying well.<br/><br/>The game has two phases: Courtship and Marriage.<br/> During the Courtship Phase, turns consist of either answering trivia (there are options of guidance from a governess for those who are not as well versed in Austen&rsquo;s works) or of acquiring Societal Tokens (Family, Ball, Trip). Trivia answered correctly gives Accomplishment Cards, which are used to acquire Societal Tokens.<br/><br/>The Marriage Phase is quick and starts once the first heroine is married. At this point, each heroine goes to the church where proposals come according to how well trivia is answered. She then can choose her hero (i.e. Mr. Darcy), alternate (i.e. Mr. Collins), or to not marry at all (i.e. become Miss Bates&rsquo; new roommate).<br/><br/>Once all heroines have the option to marry or not, Life Fortune Points are counted and the heroine with the most wins.<br/><br/>"}, "151644": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Dungeon (Issue 220 - Nov 2013)", "rpgproducer": {"19115": "Greg Bilsland"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1856649.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "5.5", "rpgissue": {"1225": "Dungeon"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"125936": "Children of Ardore"}, "rpgissueversion": {"226890": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1856649_t.jpg", "description": "Contents<br/><br/>1 Guest Editorial by Will Doyle<br/>Let the real world&mdash;past or present&mdash;inspire your next adventure.<br/><br/>2 Slaark's Crown by Craig Campbell<br/>King Slaark's terrible reign is about to end.

Whatever happens, you must ensure that your characters come out on top!<br/><br/>When proposing, if a Gentleman's Charm is lower than the Lady's, he must discard cards to make up the difference. If he wants to really impress her, he can discard additional cards to boost his Charm. If the Lady accepts, the players exchange characters and whoever has the higher Wealth draws cards equal to the difference.

This can help you to dominate the matchmaking scene but will doubtless draw the ire of your rivals. It's good to be protective of your Ladies, but don't let them get left on the shelf...<br/><br/>When the deck runs out, the game ends and players tally up the Virtue of their married characters, then subtract the Virtue of their 'old maids' (Ladies left unwed in Society).

Here generals lead armies of their own creation on the field of battle in search of victory and glory.Not just for wargamers, Mayhem is perfect for roleplayers looking to integrate a customizable set of mass combat rules into their campaigns and adventures. The BATTLE CHEST edition includes both the core rules and the STRONGHOLD expansion.<br/><br/>Core rules feature overview:<br/><br/>- custom points based army construction<br/>- uses d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20 dice<br/>- VERSUS game engine [including Deadlocks and Overdrive]<br/>- play at any scale including 6mm, 10mm, 15mm, and 28mm<br/>- players can use armies based for other systems<br/>- no casualty removal<br/>- rule for magic including spells like blink, summon, and time stop<br/>- includes quick reference sheets, army construction worksheet, and General&rsquo;s Compendium<br/>- official support from popular miniature manufacturers<br/><br/>The MAYHEM core rules give you complete control over building your army from the ground up. After creating core profiles and heroes, you have over 60 options at your disposal that can be used to equip and upgrade. These include unit designations, weapons, armor, standards, traits, abilities, and gear.<br/><br/>The VERSUS game engine layers mechanics and interactions in such a way as to provide a truly innovative and unique gaming experience. To begin with, stats in the game are not based on fixed numbers but on die types instead. Anytime that you are called upon to roll dice, you may instead choose to take the default; this is equal to half the value of the die. This choice of risk versus reward is behind every decision in the game.  These die types can be improved in steps depending on which weapons a unit is equipped with and what type of unit it is combating. This system of soft and hard counters means no complicated tables or stat lines are needed, yet it rewards the application of both tactics and strategy.<br/><br/>The game can be played at any scale, and players may use armies already based for other popular mass battle systems. Speaking of basing, there is no individual casualty removal in the game so hobbyists are free to make each unit a mini diorama. And, after you&rsquo;ve mastered the basics of battle, the STRONGHOLD expansion awaits!<br/><br/>The STRONGHOLD expansion includes rules for:<br/><br/>- advanced terrain options including the garrisoning, attacking, and burning of structures<br/>- new designations like scout, skirmisher, and heroic skirmisher<br/>- heroes to engage one another in epic challenges<br/>- battle sorcerers that can focus their magical powers to control hulking mechanical constructs or harness the fury of bound behemoths<br/>- new spells, traits, abilities, and gear<br/>- building your own strongholds and keeps including over 15 upgrades to create the ultimate fortress<br/>- siege engines and laying siege to enemy strongholds and keeps<br/>- new scenarios including border keeps and a unique mass battle multiplayer mode<br/>- campaigns and linked games with unit progression, multiple paths to victory, and seasonal weather effects<br/><br/>The expansion has been set-up as a toolbox that will allow you to pick and choose the rules that best fit your group and the gaming experience you&rsquo;re looking for.

The hard part is often coming up with the original idea and design. The Cartographer's Annual aims to produce a wide variety of such styles to give you an out-of-the-box way to make your maps look fresh and serve as inspiration for your own designs. Jon Roberts' Cities Style: Each style pack is accompanied by a mapping guide which tells you how to use the templates, drawing tools and symbols and takes you step-by-step through the creation of an example map in this new style. Symbols: Occasionally the Cartographer's Annual will provide new symbol sets designed to create a specific type of map or to supplement an existing set. Dungeon Diorama Tiles: Map Collections: Some types of maps crop up again and again in role-playing games: taverns, caves, small villages and their ilk. The Annual will supply example maps for these that can be quickly adapted to your own needs.

In addition to a dozen existing otherworldly foes, Mythic Monsters: Mythos also enumerates every creature from the official Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiaries (and a few more besides) that qualifies for the mythos descriptor, as well as mythic path abilities for alien alchemy and the mysterious Elder Signs, plus four mythic alchemical compounds to spice up the laboratory of your favorite deranged researcher of the cosmos. To top it all off, Mythic Monsters: Mythos introduces an entirely new 13th mythic monster, the swift and deadly mythic greater byakhee, a star-spanning mount, minion, and menace perfect for the summoning rituals of your local cosmic cultists!<br/><br/>The Mythic Monsters series from Legendary Games brings you dynamic and exciting mechanics alongside evocative and cinematic new abilities that really help creatures live up to their flavor text, whether they are creatures of real-world myth and legend or creatures born out of the RPG tradition itself.

Sure, they can bite and claw and do other nasty things to hurt you, but there&rsquo;s no innate malice there. Those sorts of creatures are just going about their business, doing what they do, and the adventurers unfortunately get in the way. The scary monsters are the humanoids, the ones who have personalities and motivations and very specific goals. They have bad intentions. They hold grudges. They&rsquo;ll actively set out to mess you up.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s also easier to keep the roleplaying in a roleplaying game when you can interact with a genuine villain on a level other than swinging a sword, shooting and arrow, or casting a spell at him. You can kill a big dumb animal by rote, without feeling much more than a sense of security that it won&rsquo;t hurt you or anyone else ever again. You can&rsquo;t kill a humanoid that&rsquo;s acted with intention, that&rsquo;s made it&rsquo;s personal, that you&rsquo;ve had an actual conversation with, and not feel something. Anger, jealousy, disgust, a craving for justice, something. Humanoids are where the juicy, character-driven stories are at.<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s why humanoids have always been my go-to monsters. Sure, I have encounters with other types of creatures, and work to make them as thrilling and challenging as possible, but the heart of every story has a person. When I need a wandering monster, it&rsquo;s usually humanoids wandering around for some logical reason. When I need to adjust a challenge rating, I add in as many humanoids as needed. They&rsquo;re flexible foes, and whether you&rsquo;re in a city, a forest, a swamp, under the the sea or deep below the earth, it&rsquo;s always easy to find a story context for them to be there.<br/><br/>As a gamemaster, the problem with humanoids is the same as with any other monster &mdash; players read the books. They know what to expect, and they know how to defeat any standard-issue creature you throw at them. A band of orcs? Yawn. Drow? Soldiers or nobles? Our job as gamemasters is to mix things up, keep players on their toes and keep the game interesting. Slaughtering the 500th kobold of the current campaign doesn&rsquo;t get you there.<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s why I put together the Monster Hide series. Each of these short, no-frills PDFs brings you 5 stat blocks for variant and alternate monsters, of one humanoid type. Mix and match them with the standard-issue foes to give your players some surprises. What do you mean, I hit it with an arrow for max damage and it&rsquo;s still standing? What do you mean, the orc is 9 feet tall? Hold on, did you say the drow&rsquo;s eyes were glowing red?<br/><br/>"}, "151834": {"rpgitemversion": {"227228": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Die Goldenen H\u00e4nde Suc'naaths und andere Abenteuer", "rpgproducer": {"19529": "Heiko Gill"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1861963.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"2572": "Cthulhu Classic (1920s & 1930s)"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"310": "Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpggenre": {"988": "Horror (Cthulhu Mythos)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1861963_t.jpg", "description": "user summary<br/>This PDF contains a reedition (from the original in Cthuloide Welten magazine) of 3 scenarios focussing on the 1920s.<br/><br/>These are:<br/><br/>Die Goldenen H&auml;nde Suc'naaths<br/>a scenario in Berlin, containig strange phrases from the bible<br/><br/>Soweit die Tr&auml;ume tragen<br/>a scenario that leads to the Dreamlands<br/><br/>Staub zu Staub<br/>a scenario in Lovecraft Country<br/><br/>"}, "151835": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1874932.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"131260": "Qwixx"}, "is_expanded_by": {"167305": {"name": "Qwixx gemixxt"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"11781": {"name": "Steffen Benndorf"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"11901": "Oliver Freudenreich"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"17159": {"name": "Game Factory"}}, "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1874932_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Qwixx: Das Kartenspiel captures the spirit of Qwixx &mdash; with players still trying to cross off numbers in four colored rows as best they can &mdash; but this game uses cards instead of dice, allowing for more tactics and planning as you draft and play a hand of cards.<br/><br/>As in the original game, in Qwixx: Das Kartenspiel each player has a scoresheet with the numbers 2-12 in rows of red and yellow and the numbers 12-2 in rows of green and blue. You want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it's to the right of all marked off numbers in the same row. The deck has 44 cards, eleven in each color numbered 2-12; the back of each card shows the number but without the color. Each player starts with a hand of four cards, and four other cards are laid out face-down &mdash; that is, with the color hidden &mdash; in a row beside the remaining deck of cards.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player fills her hand to five cards by drawing from the four cards on display, then refills the card display from the deck. Using the number now visible on the top card of the deck, each player can choose to cross off one instance of this number in one row on her scoresheet. The active player then plays 1-3 cards from her hand, all of which must be the same color. She can cross off the numbers on these cards &mdash; but only if at most one number is missing in the series of numbers to be crossed off. For example, if she discards 2, 3 and 5 in blue, she can cross off these three numbers (assuming that she hasn't crossed off any blue numbers previously); if she discards 2, 3, and 6 in blue, then she can cross off the 2, the 3, the 2 and 3, or the 6.<br/><br/>If a player has crossed off five numbers in a color, then she can cross off the rightmost number (2 or 12) should the opportunity arise; if she does, she also crosses off a lock token in this color. If the active player can't cross off a number during her turn, she must mark a penalty box.<br/><br/>When a player has &quot;locked&quot; two colors on her scoresheet or marked off four penalty boxes, the game ends. Each player tallies her score in each color &mdash; the more numbers crossed off, the more you score &mdash; then sums these totals and subtracts any penalty points. Whoever scores the most points wins!<br/><br/>For a variant, Qwixx: Das Kartenspiel includes eleven multicolored joker cards, also numbered 2-12, that are shuffled into the deck. A player determines the color of this card only when playing it on her turn.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"229259": "Dutch first edition"}, "name": "Qwixx: Das Kartenspiel", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "291", "average": "6.50636"}, "151836": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Chicken Cha Cha Cha", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogameversion": {"227237": "iPad edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2471": "Animals"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2153": "Educational"}, "videogameplatform": {"6826": "iPad"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Chicken Cha Cha Cha!<br/><br/>The award-winning memory-training board game for up to four kids now available for iPad!

Just meaningless art by the original creator of the inn, pay them no mind.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The Red Tape Tavern is a single map of the ground floor of a posh inn so named for its tendency to be used by bureaucrats, diplomats, merchants, and other higher-class clientele and its multiple tapestries hanging from the ceiling. The Red Tape Tavern includes a 360-degree panoramic view of the inn from the perspective of the center of the room near the bar stools.<br/><br/>The Red Tape Tavern is intended for use in fantasy games. The inn can also be used in a modern game for an inn with a retro feel. The 360-degree view also has some wall etchings that may give it some Horror appeal as well.<br/><br/>Adventure hook for use with this product.<br/><br/>Night Deals: The Red Tape Tavern is known for as a place where deals are made at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Bureaucrats, diplomats, merchants, and nobles make business deals and political agreements here all day long. What they don&rsquo;t know is that behind the tapestries, the Unseen sees all that occurs. The Unseen subtly guides these deals and agreements, always making sure they will be broken, forcing the all the patrons to return day after day. The Unseen was trapped in the inn by the original creator of the Red Tape Tavern, an engineer and artist slowly driven insane by the Unseen, but gained a measure of vengeance by sealing him in the inn before his death. The Unseen wishes only to cause madness and chaos. The Unseen has been working his way into the minds of the people who run the inn, especially the bartender and servers. They have become his newest cult and he is instructing them in the occult. The Unseen prepares for the day when his followers finally figure out a way to break the sculptor&rsquo;s seal and return to the world to cause real havoc once again.<br/><br/>The player characters could end up staying the night on that fateful occasion. The followers of the Unseen attempt to kidnap inn patrons and the player characters to their dark god. If the player characters fight them off, they find the other cultists downstairs with the other inn patrons in tow. They remove the painting behind the bar, revealing a disturbing miasma of wisplike tentacles with a centralized distinguishing feature, a single, circular eye similar to the etchings in the tapestry. The cultists sacrifice the inn patrons, weakening the seal, and the Unseen&rsquo;s tentacles grapple and crush some of its own followers, finishing the occult ritual. The player characters either need to fight the Unseen and its mad followers or try to escape the inn.<br/><br/>"}, "151879": {"rpg": {"9041": "Mutants & Masterminds (3rd Edition)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Yuletide", "rpgproducer": {"68453": "C.

(Unlike Days of Decision, Gathering Storm covers only the European events leading to war.)<br/><br/>&lt;From the publisher's website:&gt;<br/><br/>Gathering Storm, both a game in its own right and a prequel to GMT&rsquo;s A World at War, covers the period from 1935 to the outbreak of World War II, whenever that might be. Like A World at War, Gathering Storm simulates the military, economic, political, diplomatic, research and production preparations for the Second World War, allowing the players to explore what might have happened if:<br/><br/>- Admiral Doenitz had convinced his superiors of the importance of submarine warfare in the impending war with Britain.<br/>- Germany had pursued the Z Plan earlier and more consistently.<br/>- The development of the &ldquo;Ural bomber&rdquo; had been pursued.<br/>- Poland had become a German satellite, rather than resisting German aggression.<br/>- War had broken out over the Sudetenland, or even the remilitarization of the Rhineland.<br/>- Mussolini had given a lower priority to naval armaments, to the benefit of the Italian armor and air forces.<br/>- France had extended the Maginot Line.<br/>- de Gaulle&rsquo;s arguments to expand and strengthen France&rsquo;s armor units had been accepted.<br/>- Britain had rearmed sooner.<br/>- Russia had deferred the Great Purges. Or accelerated them.<br/>- The Spanish civil war had been won by the Loyalists.<br/>- A civil war had broken out in Yugoslavia. Or Greece.<br/>- Atomic fission had been discovered earlier.<br/>- The Second World War had begun with a Franco-Italian conflict. Or a French pre-emptive attack on Germany. Or a Russo-German war, with Italy and the Western Allies neutral.<br/>- War comes early. Or later, in 1940 or even 1941. <br/>- YOU had been in command.<br/><br/>Gathering Storm can be played as a separate game in a single session, with its own victory conditions, but A World at War players will want to press on and see how the war they have created plays out. While using different mechanics, Gathering Storm's structure is consistent with A World at War and allows for a seamless transition to whatever alternate war the players planned &ndash; or stumbled into.  Some 30 years in development, with three years of design and playtesting, Gathering Storm, includes the following:<br/><br/>- Six random events each turn, providing unlimited replay value.<br/>- Economics based on tiles and activity counters, eliminating any paperwork.<br/>- Flexible mobilization rules, allowing players to emphasis civilian or military production &ndash; each at the expense of the other.<br/>- Unit construction which allows players to activate reserve units for immediate benefits, at a cost of limiting future options.<br/>- Variable research, which can focus on air, naval, military or intelligence projects, as well as short or long term gains.<br/>- A fast-moving diplomatic system, with each player allocating diplomatic counters each turn. Diplomatic targets are public, but the points allocated to them are not.<br/>- Shipbuilding that allows varied fleets, including the possibility of 5-factor super battleships.<br/>- Ahistorical A World at War counters, including armor units of different strengths and additional ships. <br/>- A dynamic crisis system, in which the Allies can appease or oppose the Axis, with neither side necessarily being certain whether war might break out.<br/>- No dice.<br/><br/>Gathering Storm is a must-buy for any committed A World at War player, an excellent &ndash; and possibly dangerously time consuming &ndash; introduction to the A World at War universe for those unfamiliar with that game, and a enjoyable and instructive fast-paced game all on its own.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"227432": "First edition"}, "name": "Gathering Storm", "playingtime": "480", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "43", "expands": {"7614": {"name": "A World at War"}}, "average": "5.67558"}, "151953": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1887114.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"62674": {"name": "Aaron Dill"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamepublisher": {"2476": {"name": "Battlefront Miniatures Ltd"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1887114_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "Firefly: The Game - Pirates &amp; Bounty Hunters, the first full game expansion for Firefly: The Game, introduces a heavy dose of player-versus-player interaction to the 'Verse.

Von-Neumann Machines (&quot;Replicators&quot;) are self-replicating machines that behave, research, and reproduce differently than other empires, while having their own Empire Advantages. Replicators can be used by a fifth player, as an opponent in co-op games, or as a teaching empire for new players as the Replicator player doesn't have to fill out a production sheet or track the technology on his ships.<br/><br/>Space Empires: Replicators also includes hex-sized terrain tiles for planets, asteroids, nebulae, and other permanent terrain effects. When an exploration marker reveals a terrain effect that stays on the map, the exploration marker is removed and replaced by a tile, giving the map a nice visual effect. (By removing the exploration marker, this also creates more room in the hexes because now the entire hex is the terrain.) For epic games, the backs of some of these tiles can be used to connect two Space Empires Boards.<br/><br/>New Deep Space terrain is included in this expansion, with the Galactic Capital (which comes with its own scenario), Regional Map, Gravitational Anomaly, Space Pirates, and the Fold in Space.<br/><br/>Each player also is dealt his own (random) resource deck at the start of the game. Everyone starts with a hand of three cards and draws a new one each turn. These cards can be used as an event or turned in for CP. Cards impact battles, exploration, economics &mdash; almost every aspect of the game; they can add unpredictable twists and impact your strategy. More powerful resource cards require you to discard an extra card to play them.<br/><br/>New Ships are included in Space Empires: Replicators, with these ships requiring a new technology &mdash; Advanced Construction &mdash; to be researched. There are three levels of Advanced Construction, and it cannot be researched until the Economic Phase after your empire has built a BC or larger ship. Thus, they won't be available until the middle game at the earliest. The ships opened up by Advanced Construction include:<br/><br/><br/>    Battle Carriers (BV), which are large carriers that can fight well, carry six Fighters, and come equipped with Anti-Sensor Hull (immune to Mines). Fighter 4s can also be researched and built.<br/>    Advanced Destroyers (DDX) that can mount Attack 2, Defense 2, and come with Heavy Warheads (automatically hit on a 1 or a 2).<br/>    Advanced Raiders (RX) that can mount Attack 3, Defense 3, and can carry one ground unit!<br/><br/><br/>All of the advanced ships can also be equipped with Fast technology (similar to BCs) if Fast 2 is researched. These changes don't impact the early and midgame, but make the DDs and Rs relevant in the late game. Raiders and Fighters are often curve balls that, once the opponent has reacted to them, lose their potency. This gives players another chance to throw a curve later in the game.<br/><br/>Some additional counters have been included for all players. The Fleet and Miner counters that were misprinted in the Close Encounters expansion have also been corrected.

Use your skill and judgement to play like the professionals.<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>The Spectrum version, playable on both the 16K and 48K models, is a highly cut-down version of Pool. There are only six balls, three red and three blue. There is no black.<br/><br/>Shots are lined up by moving a target clockwise or anti-clockwise around the table. A key toggles between different strengths of shot, and another key executes the shot.<br/><br/>The rules are substantially different from a normal game of Pool. The player receives three shots at the start of their break. If a ball is not sunk with three shots the player loses. A foul also results in the loss of a shot. In addition, the aim of the game is not just to sink the balls of your own colour, but rather all the balls.

You gain food by growing it on your farm or by plundering your opponents as a warlord. Struggle through drought, pestilence, and aggressive neighbors to become the greatest farmer of all time!<br/><br/>The game can be played with 2 to 4 players, but is best with 4.  The game content is appropriate for any age, but the complexity would be a reasonable challenge for a bright seven year old.  Game play is about 45 minutes to an hour, and you will have eaten (usually) 16 of the edible counters when you are done.  (... so don't use large cookies or shots of tequila, but animal crackers or small, disposable cups of beer work fine).<br/><br/>The game lasts for 8 'years,' where each year is split into two seasons.  Each year the players draw cards and choose (in advance) one to play each in the spring and summer seasons.  The players choose whether or not to plant their fields for the spring season, then the spring weather is revealed and players resolve their actions.  There is some flexibility in how a player chooses to resolve the action, especially if he did not plant, but he must use the card that he previously selected for the season.  Crops are calculated and each player must eat one 'food.'  Hopefully he is not eating the last of his seed crop!  Then the planting, weather, action resolution, and crop resolution are repeated for the summer season.  Finally, any warlord tribute is paid before the next year starts.<br/><br/>The game is about 60% luck and 40% skill -- the best players tend to win more often but not every game.  It is silly and fun, with unexpected turnarounds due to odd weather or unexpected cards.  There is also a mechanic where a player who has been wiped out can cash in 'food stamps' and keep playing.<br/><br/>"}, "151519": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Bound by Flame", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"240069": "English/European PlayStation 3 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2196442.png", "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "6", "videogamecharacter": {"25701": "Adaril"}, "average": "6.41667", "videogamegenre": {"2339": "Action RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"5248": "Linux"}, "poll": {}, "vgcharacterversion": {"249831": "Adaril"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2196442_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A mercenary possessed by a flame demon can either embrace the demon inside and gain evil powers or reject it and earn heroic talents.
