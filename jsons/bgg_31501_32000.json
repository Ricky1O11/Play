The game has been designed to ensure that, just as in reality, the commanders (you) are fully occupied with decision making from the outset. Your key objective is to outmanoeuvre the enemy army and concentrate your forces at critical points in the battle. This will then destroy the enemy's will to fight, deal a devastating blow to the morale of their commanders (your opponent) and allow you to win.<br/><br/>Our companion army list books will contain historical overviews and the organisation of hundreds of accurately researched armies, ensuring that your battles will be able to have a realistic and historical feel.<br/><br/>Also, in reality, some armies would be relatively small, consisting of as few as 5,000 men, whilst others would be enormous. Field of Glory will allow you to see what might have been had these forces been equally matched, using a points system, as each army can then be scaled up or down whilst retaining an individual mix and balance of troops to create &ldquo;what if&rdquo; encounters.<br/><br/>We started with a blank sheet of paper and looked at a wide range of possible mechanisms. Some concepts are entirely new. Others may look familiar at first glance, but interact with the rest of the rules in a completely new way, giving Field of Glory a style all its own.<br/><br/>In Field of Glory our most important objective is to make the game fun to play whilst retaining a strong historical feel.

The time frame is the not-too-distant future, roughly between now and the end of 2014. On the Chinese side, the viewpoint of the player is that of Peking's top-rung national leadership. On the US side, the opposing player represents the top-rung military commander in the Western Pacific theater. The game is easily adaptable for solitaire play.<br/><br/>The system &ndash; given we're dealing with events that haven't happened and therefore can't be studied in detail after the fact &ndash; has been crafted to present the war as a unitary vision rather than a strictly sequenced process. The action can alternately telescope or expand, sometimes moving ahead in whip snake lunges, at other times decelerating to dream-like slow motion. The system is more quantum mechanics than Newtonian, more Escher than Rockwell. Its presents a time-space inter-flow that can only be grasped in totality by the human mind once play is over and the entire war can be looked back on and chronicled in a reconstructed linear fashion (much like day-to-day reality).<br/><br/>Three initial assumptions are as follows. First, the Chinese are cast &ndash; not unreasonably, we think &ndash; as the aggressors. Put in terms as politically correct as possible: they're the &quot;revisionist power&quot; here, the nation wanting to overturn the present-day status quo in the Western Pacific: they're conducting a strategic  offensive. Second, the war inevitably starts over Taiwan, as that island is the unavoidably the first strategic block Peking must neutralize on the way to becoming East Asia's hegemon. Third, the war will not begin with a nuclear attack; though the danger of that kind of escalation may not be far off.<br/><br/>Most ground units in the game represent brigades (&quot;brigade combat teams&quot; or &quot;BCT&quot; for the US). The exceptions are: 1) the Singaporean army is entirely represented by just one unit-counter; and 2) the Taiwanese and Philippine armies are represented by their corps components.<br/><br/>Aircraft units are mostly represented by mixed-type combat wing formations, though only one aircraft type &ndash; the predominant one for each such wing &ndash; is shown on each counter. Long range bombers have their own mono-type units that can't combine operations with the other tactical air wings in the game.<br/><br/>Ship units mostly represent mission-oriented groupings of vessels (Surface Action Groups). Aircraft carriers and cruise missile attack submarines each represent just one such vessel of those types. Other submarines are represented in groups called &quot;Subrons.&quot; On the area map, each inch equals approximately 100 miles.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Command Japan edition", "Strategy & Tactics edition"], "average": "7.175", "name": "Red Dragon Rising: The Coming War With China", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Dice Rolling"], "age": "0", "usersrated": "114", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: China", "Magazine: Strategy & Tactics"]}, "31555": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Tower of Terror", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1992", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1924448_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Spear's Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1924448.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Dice"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "This is a childrens game Ages 4 and up<br/><br/>The aim is to race to the tower with your playing pieces and be the first to get one there.<br/><br/>On your turn you choose which of 2 possible ways you will move a playing piece:<br/><br/>a- running, your piece stands up vertically in the holes and you throw 2 dice<br/><br/>b- crawling, your pieces crawls on its belly.

After that day, the German high command, though they didn't yet understand they were soon to be fully and finally defeated, knew an offensive solution to the war was no longer available to them. The German player is generally on the offensive, trying to cross the Marne River and exit units southward off the map through the Surmelin valley.<br/><br/>The first game turn of FB represents roughly the first two hours of operations after the Germans began crossing the Marne. Those operations were conducted in the slowing conditions of early morning darkness. Every game turn after the first represents from 15 to about 45 minutes, depending on the intensity of tactical action that takes place within each turn as the daylight battle unfolds.<br/><br/>On the US side the units of maneuver are infantry platoons, along with static heavy weapons emplacements. The latter represent one or two dug-in and pre-sited heavy machineguns and/or 37 mm guns (&quot;one pounders&quot;).<br/><br/>The German units are organized so as to be reflective of the chaos created among them by the intense US aerial and heavy artillery bombardment that was conducted against their north bank marshalling areas and bridges. That is, German units represent ad hoc, mixed, tactical formations (primarily storm trooper infantry), ranging in size from sections and squads up to almost full companies, which the Germans self-organized as they left the complete chaos of the riverbank and moved into the semi-chaos of the actual battlefield. Each hexagon on the map represents 100 yards from side to opposite side.<br/><br/>The reverse sides of all the units in the game show carnage. That is, they present a depiction of the human wreckage remaining when units of these small sizes are eliminated in combat. Whenever a unit suffers that fate, players simply turn it over in place, so its carnage side thereafter shows upward within the hex of its elimination. When flipped to their carnage sides, units permanently cease to be &quot;units&quot; for all game purposes, thereafter serving only as reminders of the recent horror that took place in that location.<br/><br/>Carnage markers have no combat effects or stacking values, nor does their presence in a hex generate any extra movement cost for living units as they enter and/or pass through the killing field. Alternatively, if your tastes don't run to an appreciation of carnage, you may choose to ignore the reverse sides of the units and simply remove each unit to a traditional, off-map, &quot;dead pile&quot; as they suffer elimination.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Strategy & Tactics Edition"], "average": "6.01386", "name": "First Blood: Second Marne", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "0", "usersrated": "44", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Magazine: Strategy & Tactics"]}, "31559": {"boardgamedesigner": ["How-Hie Ling"], "poll": [], "name": "Chessling", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement"], "yearpublished": "1994", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Chess Games"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "from Game Cabinet rules:<br/><br/>Use the same board and pieces as for International Chess (also known as English Chess or Western Chess).<br/>Start with an empty board.<br/><br/>One side starts first on any square, after which play continues in turn.

It is one of the first games to use the peripheral, which is bundled with the game, along with a fixed Starter Deck and 1 booster pack. The trading cards are encrypted along their edges with a CyberCode matrix code. The game can also be played without the use of the Playstation 3 system, as a stand-alone card game.<br/><br/>Players take turns playing creatures or spell cards from a 30-card deck in order to control a majority (5 fields) of the 9 total fields on the playing mat which is laid out in a 3x3 grid.  Other than  controlling a majority of fields, players can also win if their opponent runs out of cards to play.  Creatures' overall effectiveness is determined by their Hit Points and Attack Score as well as any special abilities they may possess.  Five elements divide the game's units: Water, Fire, Earth, Wood, and Biolith.  The playing grid fields have a top and bottom side and each side is affiliated with one of the five elements.  Creatures placed on friendly elements receive HP bonuses while creatures placed on an opposite element (a Fire creature placed on a Water field) suffer a loss of Hit Points, so unit placement is important.<br/><br/>In order to play any card (creature or spell), players must first pay a card's required summoning cost in mana (auto-generated for players every turn).  Each creature has a specific attack and defense pattern and these, along with the unit's placement on the 3x3 grid, determine where combat occurs and to some extent, how it resolves.  The extremely unique aspect of the Eye of Judgment game, however, is that when you play a card, the PlayStation Eye peripheral automatically generates that creature or spell into a 3D graphical version on your TV or monitor and it places it on a computerized version of the playing grid.  It also generates battle animations and resolutions digitally based on the cards involved or recently played.  This adds a level of visceral excitement to the collectible card game experience since you can actually see your minions battling it out in colorful digital fashion.  There isn't a single-player campaign but players can play matches vs. an AI opponent, another human, or online vs. other human opponents.

It was produced by Toy Creations Inc. of New York, and a signed dedication inside the box lid promised to donate all royalties to charity.<br/><br/>The game comes with 144 thick cardboard tiles: 48 states divided into four color-coded regions; 48 state capitols; 30 primary industries; 10 &quot;favorite sons&quot;; and 8 American flags (wild cards). There are four cardboard racks for holding each player's tiles (neatly designed to create red-and-white stripes when laid sideways in the box next to the blue-starred covered rules).<br/><br/>The tiles are shuffled face down on the table between the players. Each player draws a hand of 12 tiles to start. Each in turn then draws a tile and then discards a tile (the same or another). As in mah-jong, the player must announce the discard. The next player may pick up either the discard or a blind tile, but any player may claim the discard if it completes a partial set. He must reveal enough tiles to prove the set (e.g. two other states of the same color), thus revealing part of his strategy, but play then passes to the seizing player's left, with any in between missing their turns.<br/><br/>There are eight potential scoring combinations. The easiest, scoring 5, is a hand with three states in each of the four regions. The most difficult, scoring 30, requires three states each with their capitols, one of their industries and a favorite son. (Since some industries have only a single tile, and only 10 states have favorite sons, this can be very difficult indeed.) However, the 8 American flag tiles can be used as wild cards.<br/><br/>If a player needs information (such as a state's favorite son or industry), he may ask questions out loud, and pays 5 into a bonus pot for each question. As soon as a player completes a winning hand, he calls &quot;America&quot; and collects the value of the hand from each player as well as anything in the bonus pot. Cardboard discs in four colors are supplied, with their values to be assigned by the players.<br/><br/>"}, "31638": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic244022.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Richard Borg"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2007", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Cyrille Daujean", "Julien Delval"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Days of Wonder"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic244022_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Aviation / Flight", "Expansion for Base-game", "Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "This expansion for Memoir '44 includes eight painted airplanes and the air rules needed to fly them from the Battle of Britain to the Battle of Midway, from the frigid air of Kursk to the balmy skies of Malta, and deep into Nazi territory.<br/><br/>Also included in the pack is a complete compilation of all 64 official Memoir '44 scenarios published to date, including revisions to many of them - taking advantage of the numerous expansions now available for the game system.<br/><br/>The Air Pack is further rounded off with a complete 120 card deck describing every single terrain, special rules, troop type and nation introduced since the game's launch at the 60-year anniversary of D-Day.<br/><br/>Part of the Memoir '44 series.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Days of Wonder PDF edition", "English first edition", "French first edition"], "average": "7.60344", "name": "Memoir '44: Air Pack", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Modular Board"], "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "1128", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Commands & Colors", "Memoir '44"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 5 - Omaha beach"]}, "31640": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Teen Magazine: The Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1985", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic244014_t.jpg", "average": "0", "boardgamepublisher": ["Cardinal"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic244014.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Cardinal Edition 2004"], "maxplaytime": "0", "poll": [], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The box cover for this game claims that this is a game that is all about guys, real life, celebs, beauty and style.

Each game turn is broken down into three phases:<br/>Phase 1: Welcoming the Princes<br/>Phase 2: Development of the City<br/>Phase 3: Calculation of Prestige Points<br/><br/>Phase 1: Welcoming the Princes<br/><br/>In the first phase, Guest tokens are placed on the board near ship icons but corresponding to the symbol on each token. These guest tokens are then replaced with Prince tokens that is their own color, or of the same civilization as the chosen Guest or in any District of the island indicated by the Guest or any combination of these. This is repeated three times until all Guest tokens have been removed from the board. While this is happening, players may Build a Wonder or Take Control of a District.<br/><br/>At any point during their turn, if a player has one prince of each of the 5 civilizations on one island (regardless of which Districts they are in), he may immediately construct a Wonder and receives 6 Prestige Points. There may only be one Wonder per island and a player does not have to construct Wonders.<br/><br/>At any point during their turn, if a player possesses 3 princes of the same civilization in the same District, and that District is not already controlled by another player, he may decide to take control of the District by placing a Monument on that District. There can only be one Monument per District, and this space, once acquired, cannot be retaken. For taking control of a District the player gains Prestige Points during Phase 3: Calculation of Prestige Points. Also, if the District belongs to an island where a Wonder has been constructed, the owner of the Wonder immediately scores the number of Prestige Points indicated on the District.<br/><br/>Phase 2: Development of the City<br/><br/>Each player receives 5 Action cards and discards based on their score in the score track. The person in the lead discards two cards, the last player doesn't discard any and all other players discard one. Four types of actions are possible and occur multiple times in a player's turn:<br/><br/>1) Move one or two princes:<br/><br/>If a player decides to move two princes with a single action card, these two princes must be within the same District and make the same movement.<br/><br/>LAND MOVEMENT: By discarding an action card, a player may move one or two princes of that civilization to an adjacent District (Districts are separated by alleys or bridges).<br/><br/>SEA MOVEMENT: By discarding an action card, a player may move one or two princes of that civilization from one maritime District (showing a ship) to another maritime District. These two Districts must be in the same maritime sector or in two adjacent maritime sectors. (The division of the maritime sectors is indicated by the dotted lines originating from the 3 lighthouses of the city).<br/><br/>2) Add a prince:<br/><br/>By discarding an Action Card, a player may place a prince in a District occupied by a Monument of that civilization.<br/><br/>3) Remove a Prince:<br/><br/>If the player possesses a prince in a District occupied by a Monument of that civilization, regardless of the player who controls the District, that player may, with an Action Card of that civilization, remove the Prince from the board. For this action the player immediately gains 2 Prestige Points. Th e player&rsquo;s Minister figure is moved up two places on the Score Track.<br/><br/>or 4) Influence the King (altering the Prestige Scale):<br/><br/>If the player possesses a prince in a District occupied by a Monument of that civilization, regardless of the player who controls the District, that player may, with an Action Card of that civilization, remove the Prince from the board. For this action the player immediately gains 2 Prestige Points. The player&rsquo;s Minister figure is moved up two places on the Score Track.<br/><br/>The value of each civilization, indicated on the Prestige Scale, determines the point value of the districts controlled by each player at the end of the turn. By discarding an Action Card, a player may increase the value of a civilization by 1. The Value figure of the civilization changes places with the figure directly above it. With two Action cards, a player may reduce the value of a civilization to 1. All the other figures are moved up accordingly. At the end of their turn a player can only have a maximum of 5 Action Cards.<br/><br/>Phase 3: Calculation of Prestige Points<br/><br/>Once all the players have carried out their actions, the points for the round are calculated. Each player, in turn order, gains points for each District that they control. The value of each civilization is indicated on the Prestige Scale. The players&rsquo; Minister figures are moved up the Score Track.<br/><br/>If one or more players have reached at least 50 Prestige Points at the end of this phase, the game ends.

Roberts, who would go on to found of Avalon Hill Games. The original edition of Tactics was published by the Avalon Game company, with a print run of approximately 2000. Roberts sold Tactics by mail order out of a garage in Avalon, Maryland.<br/><br/>The game portrayed a modern day strategic conflict between the forces of two hypothetical countries. The opposing units included infantry, armor, and airborne forces. The game was played on a mapboard which used a square grid rather than the hex-based style map which would later became preferred in the board wargaming industry. However, many of the conventions and mechanics established in Tactics still live on, in one form or another, in many of the wargames published today.<br/><br/>Based on his success with Tactics, Roberts decided to expand his operation and in 1958 he formed Avalon Hill Games. The initial line-up of games from Avalon Hill included Tactics II, a revised version of Roberts' original wargame. Avalon Hill would go on to publish a 25th Anniversary edition of Tactics in 1983, which represented a modified version of the original game in that it used a prototype mapboard which had not previously been released.<br/><br/>Other than a few graphical changes there are some functional changes from the Tactics map to the Tactics II map:<br/><br/>Going over the 1954 Tactics and 1958 Tactics II boards square by square the only functional changes are:<br/> - The squares around the edge of the map for 1958 now have numbers 1 to 43 from North to South and 1 to 55 West to East.<br/> - Cities for 1958 had unique numbers added. <br/>No numbers are present on the 1954 board in the cities or the grid.<br/> - There is no map compass on the mapboard label like there is in Tactics II<br/> - The mountain pass in the large mountain range on the board label edge is not present on the 1954 map. Also there is only one single clear square, same place as in Tactics II, 7 squares in from the Blue coastal city near the map label in that mountain range.

Filipino revolutionary forces under Emilio Aguinaldo declared proclaimed independence of the Philippine islands from the colonial rule of Spain. The declaration of independence however was not recognized by the United States of America and Spain since the Spanish government ceded the Philipines to the USA in the aftermath of the 1898 Treaty of Paris which formally ended the Spanish American war (April 25 to August 12, 1898). Tensions already existed between both sides due to conflicting movements of independence and colonization further aggravated by misunderstandings on both sides and feelings of betrayal on the Filipino side. The tensions escalated between the former allies on February 4, 1899 when a Filipino soldier was shot by an American soldier (William W. Grayson) in Manila. Fighting soon erupted in Manila and culminated in an official Filipino declaration of war by the Malolos congress on June 2, 1899.

They include political, military, economic and even social events, as well as the reinforcements that flowed to both sides through-out the war both from within Spain, and from foreign powers Germany, Italy and Russia.<br/>Conduct Operations: Each card has an operations value that is used for activating units on the game map for movement, preparing fortifications, or attacking.<br/>Strategic Redeployment (SR) of Troops: Each card has a Strategic Redeployment value that is used to move units great distances on the game map, or to bring units out of Reserve to shore up a threatened flank.<br/>Replacement Points for Reforming Your Army: Each card has a Replacement Point value which is recorded and used for repairing damaged or rebuilding destroyed units at the end of the turn.<br/><br/>The greater impact the historical event of a card has on the game, the greater its Operations, SR and Replacements value. As such, a player is often faced with a dilemma while playing each card: use an important event, launch an offensive in a vulnerable zone, move units from one front to other, or accumulate replacements to recover from losses? Combine this with &quot;Combat cards&quot; that bring tactical benefits, and a player faces has a myriad of choices with each and every card.<br/><br/>A complete C&amp;R game is divided into three phases, which illustrate the evolution of the Spanish Civil War and introduce new strategic cards:<br/><br/>The War of the Columns phase begins with the outbreak of war and finishes in February 1937. During this phase only &ldquo;small units&rdquo; are used, because both sides had limited combatants, almost all grouped in irregular units - called &ldquo;columns&rdquo;- that operated across large, poorly garrisoned fronts. The best of these &ldquo;small units&rdquo; are the Nationalist African Army regular army units &ndash; brought to the Spanish mainland from Morocco by Franco at the outbreak of the war. These units are strong, but brittle, as they cannot be replaced or replenished with Replacement Points.<br/><br/>The Mobilization phase lasts from March 1937 to February 1938. During this period the two sides realized that the war would not be over quickly, and began to mobilize their human and material resources to form regular armies. The players deploy their first &ldquo;large units&rdquo; (army corps) and large battles erupt across Spain.<br/><br/>The War of the Armies phase begins in March 1938 and lasts until the end of the war, in April 1939. During this time, the Nationalists tried to force the enemy&rsquo;s unconditional surrender, while the Republic fought desperately to resist and prolong the Spanish Civil War so that it might merge with the threatening Second World War, which could be seen looming in the horizon.<br/><br/>Take command of your forces! Marshall international aid and intervention to your side!

Water is scarce and you try to build your Shadoof (a sort of waterpump) as close to the Wadi as possible. A wadi, however, is a desert river. Water flows though it for only a small part of the year. The rest of the time it is dry. In the short wet period, you try to pump as much water as possible to the water reservoirs. Preferably in the vicinity of fertile land, because the more fertile the land, the better the harvest. And the better the harvest, the more points a player earns.<br/><br/>But... other players might have noticed the same good spot, where you want to build your shadoof. And when you build your shadoof there, they won&rsquo;t help you fill the water reservoirs. But if you hesitate too long, the other players might pump dry the Wadi. Or worse, the water streams down the wadi and the land close to your shadoof remain dry and barren.<br/><br/>There are a few scenarios for Wadi delivered with the game. They bring a lot of variety.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>Players build their shadoofs on the land tiles. Each shadoof can pump water pawns from the river bed or from another land tile that lies in the vicinity of that shadoof (vicinity = water pawn lies on his own tile or on an adjacent tile). In his turn a player can carry out two actions. He can either:<br/>&middot; Build 1 shadoof first and then pump 1 water pawn (or vice versa)<br/>OR<br/>&middot; Pump 2 water pawns.<br/><br/>Round after round players build shadoofs and/or pump water pawns. At the end of each round, the water that is still in the river bed, flows downstream. This means, that all the water pawns in the river beds are moved downstream 1 river tile.<br/>When the river bed is completely empty, the game is over.<br/><br/>Players earn points per shadoof. Every landtile surrounding the shadoof (including its own tile) with a water pawn on it brings 1, 2 or 3 points, depending on the fertility of the land. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Players &quot;fight&quot; to get water pawns near their shadoofs and for the places to build their shadoofs. They also try to profit from water pawns that other players pumped on to the land tiles.

There's also a chapter on dice cheating and another on modern dice.  The book is peppered with interesting stories and legends that revolve around dice.  If you ever wondered why many bone dice are hollow, it's explained.  If you want to know where the best museum exhibits of dice are, it's also covered.

The rent is a fixed cost depending on if the company has buildings or not. Players can at times during the game be forced to put one of their companies up for auction.<br/><br/>The players move on the board using markers. The players can optionally buy one of two types of cars that will cause the player to move across the board at different speeds. Using &quot;the wreck&quot; the player always has to roll two dice. The more expensive &quot;sports car&quot; gives the player the option of using one OR two dice when rolling for a move.<br/><br/>Every time the players are back at the beginning on the circular board they get and/or pay interest depending on how much money the player have in the bank and if there are any outstanding loans. The current interest rate is determined every now and then using dice rolls.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player with 4 million in cash OR the first player who owns a complete corporation (all companies in a group) and 1.5 million in cash.<br/><br/>"}, "31849": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Eierlauf", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic542250_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["HABA - Habermaa\u00df GmbH"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic542250.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Children's Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This is a twist on the usual game in which participants compete in a race while they balance an egg on a spoon.

It is very similar to his later Alien Space Battle Manual and Star Fleet Battle Manual, with good reason. Zocchi did not have a license to publish a Star Trek game when this came out, and in addition to the title the game uses images of ships from the series (the Enterprise is on the cover), not to mention the names and pictures of the characters. Paramount objected and Zocchi was forced to recall the game from stores. A few copies had already been sold, which are the ones occasionally seen today.<br/><br/>The following year, Zocchi released Alien Space Battle Manual, with all the Star Trek references replaced with ones he invented. When he obtained a license from Franz Josef Designs (allowing him to use ship designs and names such as &quot;Klingon&quot;), he published Star Fleet Battle Manual.<br/><br/>In this game, optional rules are given for the special abilities of some of the Enterprise crew - these of course do not appear in the later games.<br/><br/>"}, "31874": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Scott's Baseball Card Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "1983", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Baseball"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic248848_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Scott's Baseball Cards"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic248848.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Sports"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Front of Box:<br/><br/>&quot;The Exciting new game invented especially for bubblegum card collectors.<br/><br/>&quot;Experience the fun of card collecting and trading, card auctions, flipping contests, attic finds and much, much more.<br/><br/>A game the whole family can enjoy.

If the player does not own the method of the transportation landed on that player must pay all the players who possess that vehicle. The penalty escalates with the number of vehicles of the designated type owned.<br/>The Jamboree - Whenever two or more players land on the same space, all the players on that space spin the spinner and the player who gets the lowest number pays the penalty the space assigns.<br/>&lsquo;Round and &lsquo;Round Circle - If a player has yet to own all six parts on the assigned possession, the player must buy the remaining parts at double the price spun on the spinner. Advancing in this section means paying other players because of their occupation or because one lacks the transportation mode the space asks for. Players continue in this section until rolling doubles.<br/>The Pay Off - Players sell their possessions back to the bank for whatever space on which they land.<br/><br/>When all the players have reached the end of The Pay Off section, each type of vehicle is sold back to the bank for values as determined by the spinner.

The game reflects the poor state of the roads and the uncertainty of arriving at your destination without some mishap occurring. The aim of the game is to progress from the petrol station at the 'start' and travel to the gate marked 'home' via 100 squares numbered 1 to 100. Players move from the start to finish as quickly as possible by taking it in turns to throw the dice. Along the way various motoring obstacles, calamities, and misadventures including punctures, collisions, wrong turns, road blocks, flocks of sheep, bridges under repair, gravel on the road, broken springs, steep hills and axle trouble must be negotiated. These all require the player to miss throws or return to the start.<br/><br/>"}, "31918": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Game of Authors: Cribbage", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "yearpublished": "1875", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Cribbage"], "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1786583_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["McLoughlin Brothers"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1786583.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This old game is by the same publishers as some other 'Authors' games from the 1800s, but is a variation that is a departure from previous games by that title.<br/><br/>"}, "31919": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic249247.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Forces of Warmachine: Mercenaries", "Forces of Warmachine: Protectorate of Menoth"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Mike McVey", "Brian Snoddy", "Matt Wilson"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2007", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": ["Privateer Press", "Ulisses Spiele"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic249247_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Book", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy", "Miniatures", "Wargame"], "description": "Forces of WARMACHINE: Pirates of the Broken Coast&trade; is scheduled to release in early December and comprises 72 pages of new fiction, new model stats, and several outstanding full-color art pieces by artist Andrea Uderzo.

Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.<br/><br/>Note: The 2012 edition of Munchkin Booty from Pegasus Spiele includes the first expansion, Munchkin Booty 2: Jump the Shark.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "English First Edition, Third Printing", "English guest artist edition 2017", "English second edition (rules/card changes)", "German first edition", "German third edition", "German third edition (tin box)", "Italian first edition", "Polish first edition", "Russian first edition"], "average": "6.32211", "name": "Munchkin Booty", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Trading", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["106498", "54435", "98956", "38891", "136857", "44805", "88665", "100422", "11058", "136914", "39801", "78583", "78582", "76355", "126425", "39392", "14580", "134690", "130194", "226171", "39393", "134725", "130826", "134691", "41034", "24733", "84870", "62387", "153943", "146658", "146657", "146659", "69436", "153283", "176441", "86356", "134692"], "usersrated": "1565", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Munchkin"]}, "31921": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Senior Savvy Brainstormers", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2526178_t.png", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Elliot & Fitzpatrick Inc."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2526178.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Party Game", "Trivia"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "This is pseudo-trivia game where the players brainstorm and score based on their brainstorms.

The Soviet forces before them had been routed and the path to yet another great victory for the Wehrmacht was seemingly undefended.  But it was here that the Russian Army successfully rallied.

If you choose to jump on top of your own pieces too often, you will probably leave your opponent with too many pieces on the board.
