I'm In!&quot; card! Even better, the gambling games also can be played on their own as standalone games, or as part of your RPG, or LARP. The game will come with a 93 card Rogues and Warriors Deck, a bunch of 6 sided dice, coin tokens, debt and loan tokens and rules for at least 7 games! Some of the games use dice. Some of the games use cards from the Rogues and Warriors Deck, and some of the games use dice and cards.<br/><br/>This card deck was developed as a stand-alone game as well as a possible replacement to the gambling component in Red Dragon Inn 1 and 2.<br/><br/>The deck consists of 90 cards. The deck is broken down into three colors (rust, green, and blue) with 6 different symbols. The card faces feature 1 Knight, 2 Ladys, 3 Bards, 4 Merchants, and 5 Rogues per card symbol. There is a die symbol on each card with a number of pips equal to the number of cards of its type and a set of symbols on the right that denote character superiority in certain game variations. Some games with this deck involve 6 D6 dice (not included).<br/><br/>There are five base games included and are as follows:<br/><br/><br/>     Rogues and Warriors - Similar to two card poker, each player is dealt two cards. You compare these two cards to the symbols on the right to determine how powerful your hand is.<br/>     Threes - Uses all dice, no cards. <br/>     Jack of All Trades - Uses 5 dice and only the Rogue and Warrior cards. The theme is putting your workers to work and using the cards and dice to complete jobs.<br/>     Den of Thieves - No dice. Hands are dealt and players use the special abilities of each character to influence hand weight and scoring.<br/>     The Wheel (and The Clock) - No dice. Players try to guess what cards others are collecting in order to gain points and win the round.<br/><br/><br/>When combined with The Red Dragon games, when a player plays the &quot;Gambling, I'm in!&quot; card, the player may decide to choose any game from the list to play instead of the normal gambling rules. Special rules are included for each variation when combining this with the normal game.<br/><br/>There will be other variations available as Slugfest has invited players to create their own games with the deck and the ones deemed best will be included in later rules updates.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"312376": "English second edition"}, "maxplaytime": "5", "average": "6.18934", "name": "The Red Dragon Inn: Gambling?

The pawns must be assembled before the game is played. The pawns consist of cardboard standups that can be flipped between &quot;Robot&quot; and &quot;Vehicle&quot; mode. There are 2 different ways to play the game -- one is a very simple dexterity game, while the Advanced game adds movement, die-rolling, and a couple of other wrinkles.<br/><br/>In the Basic game, players line up their Transformers in a row, one pawn on each base, about 1 missile length apart and about 4 missile lengths from the other player's Transformers.  The players simultaneously slide their missiles across the floor or table, trying to knock down the other player's units. The first one to knock down all 4 opposing units wins.<br/><br/>In the Advanced game, the sequence of play is as follows:<br/><br/>1. Each player may convert one unit between Robot and Vehicle mode. Only units in Vehicle mode can move.<br/>2  Each player rolls his special die, which he first secretly sets to Robot or Vehicle mode.  If he has no units in a mode, he can't use it. The die results allow movement, extra shots, protection from enemy shots, or repair of a previously hit unit.<br/>3. The players slide their missiles, trying to knock over enemy units. They must slide from behind their closest unit to the other side.  Based on the die results, a player may shoot once, twice, or not at all.<br/>4.

Its setting features a fantastic equivalent of the Age of Enlightenment. Most often, the game plays in a cloak and dagger mood and involves plotting, intrigue, but also struggle in the name of honour. The game has been inspired by such authors as Alexandre Dumas, p&egrave;re, Michael Moorcock and H. P. Lovecraft. It is published by Wydawnictwo Portal (Portal Publishing House) and it is currently available only in Polish.<br/><br/>The game does not shy from dealing with serious issues such as religion or race. The players have to play humans, and they are all followers of a certain monotheistic religion. The human countries, tied together with that religion, are involved in a long struggle against all other races (elves, dwarves, orcs, etc.); their religion dictates that all of those races are doomed and beyond salvation, and must be exterminated for their own good. Magic is also considered a sign of a devil or demons, so there are no (overt) mage characters.<br/><br/>The corebook, Monastyr, does not describe the lands of non-humans, instead it concentrates on the human empire, which, while united by a single faith and church, is composed of over fifty separate countries, each involved in various struggles, political or military, with others.<br/><br/>Monastyr mechanics are based around the 3d20 system.&quot;&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Monastyr,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "46638": {"rpgitemversion": {"2651": "PDF"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "True20 Wild West", "rpgproducer": {"26861": "Mark Gedak"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic514144.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "8", "rpggenre": {"181": "History (American West)"}, "rpg": {"210": "True20"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic514144_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/>Welcome to True20 Wild West, a toolkit for use with True20 Adventure Roleplaying.

We're talking 6'6&quot; at the least, with a build to match - a trollbabe is a big woman, no little aerobicized butts allowed. All trollbabes are strong, easily the match of the strongest humans, and ranging up from there. They can run all day and heft weapons and pull bows that would wear out a human in moments. Trollbabes have primarily-human facial features, and most lack the characteristic trollish body hair and posture. Their trollishness is most obvious in their horns, which range from short goaty pointy horns to big curling sheepy horns that include a ridge over their brows. Big hair is also common; think 80s rock-and-roll.<br/><br/>Why play Trollbabe?<br/><br/>Because a trollbabe is neither troll nor human - she is functionally apart, yet tied into the fates and interactions of both peoples. Trolls - big, shaggy, horned, grotesque, people-eating monsters - and humans - plain old humans - simply don't get along, and their conflicts are escalating. The trollbabe may be perceived as an automatic friend or an automatic foe by both humans and trolls, yet her perspective is not identical with either one. Her presence cannot help but destabilize the status quo in any particular situation, which makes for an interesting life. Ultimately, she may also become the means of resolution.<br/><br/>Trollbabe is a role-playing game by Ron Edwards, creator of Sorcerer and Elfs, and founder of Adept Press. It features art by some of the great talents in the role-playing industry today: Veronica V. Jones, Ben Morgan, Rod Anderson, Jeff Diamond, and James V. West.

The map encompasses the entire theater of war from the English Channel to the Swiss Border. The game system used is a streamlined derivative of the 1914, Twilight in the East system, modified to speed play, with care not to lose focus on those aspects of warfare that made the opening stages of WWI so unique. This game system, in conjunction with the accurate map, allows the German advance to be conducted along historical routes with the eminent &ldquo;Open Flank&rdquo; present (instead of units strung out from map edge to map edge). The Allied player has an opportunity to recreate a &ldquo;Miracle of the Marne&rdquo; type victory or to stop the Germans earlier. Likewise, the German player has a chance to change history and defeat the Allies&rsquo; armies in 1914.<br/><br/>The Grand Campaign scenario covers the period from the fall of Liege on August 16th to exhaustion at Ypres in mid-November. Two shorter scenarios, The Battle for Lorraine (a learning scenario) and From the Marne to Stalemate are also provided.<br/><br/>1914, Offensive &agrave; outrance is a playable &ldquo;Monster Game&rdquo; designed with the expressed goal that the majority of the game can be completed by four dedicated players in one five-day long Expo. The 24-page rules booklet is concise, well written and organized. The game is exciting and gives wonderful insights into one of the most important campaigns of the twentieth century. The result is that 1914, Offensive &agrave; outrance is a game that the &ldquo;WW1 enthusiast&rdquo; must have and that a gaming connoisseur will enjoy.<br/><br/>Time Scale: Game turns vary between two and four days in length.<br/>Map Scale: Eight kilometers per hex.<br/>Unit Scale: Division/Brigade.<br/>Number of Players: one to many (well suited for four players).<br/><br/>Game Designer: Michael Resch<br/>Research and Design Assistance: Rian van Meeteren<br/>Developed by: Dick Vohlers<br/>Map Design Assistance: S.

Tremere are pragmatic, dutiful, and courageous magi who know that Mythic Europe is a chaotic and dangerous place.<br/><br/>These are the True Lineages.

These houses are formed of wizards who have come together out of shared interests and philosophies.<br/><br/>House Flambeau includes the champions and knights of the Order, individual warriors who fight for glory and honor, both their own and that of the Order as a whole. The House admires bold adventurers who seek out and overcome fearsome opponents. Worthy opponents are chosen according to the magus's sense of honor, not external rules. As a result, many of the Order's Hoplites are from House Flambeau, as are many of the magi they hunt down.<br/><br/>House Jerbiton live lives in pursuit of beauty, and in pursuit of living beautifully. This requires interaction with the world beyond the Order of Hermes, both for the sake of the beauty found there and to avoid the stunted lives that result from a life lived entirely within a covenant. Experts in the use of Mentem and Imaginem, followers of Jerbiton generally prefer to interact subtly with the world. The fall of Constantinople has, however, been a great shock to them, and has pushed the House onto a more active path.<br/><br/>House Tytalus thrive on, and admire, conflict. The main conflict they see is between an individual's nature and the rules imposed by surrounding society, but this central conflict plays out in many, less abstract, contests. They are renowned for long-running rivalries with their Housemates, convoluted political schemes, and activities that skirt the edges of legality.<br/><br/>House Ex Miscellanea gathers together magi who do not fit into any other House, normally because they are still tied to elements of a pre-Hermetic tradition. The House claims to embody unity in diversity, but the emphasis is definitely on the diversity.

Players don't know exactly who they are: their characters wake up after a centenary sleep in an underground room. Actually they are cyborgs: they do not know their partly mechanical origin and the powers of their enhanced body, but they discover it all quite soon.<br/><br/>The contents of the bokltet are the same that appeared in the magazine Kappa in January 1991: &quot;A short universal history of the XXVI century&quot;, the rules, the character sheet and two adventures.<br/><br/>&quot;CYB&quot; has been written as an introductory RPG to be published in the Italian monthly computer games magazine Kappa. Polyhedral dice were rare in Italy at that time, so the system uses a deck of poker playing cards instead. The four attrubutes of each character are hearts (feelings and capacity of suscitate symphaty, being able to sustain psychological stress), diamonds (willpower, self-control), spades (strenght, stamina) and clubs (dexterity, agility, body control). Attributes are determined taking a random card from a reduced deck with all the cards ranging from 1 to 6.<br/><br/>With the same system, four skills are determined. Skills also range from a value of 1 to a value of 6. The four skills of each character are hearts (communication, creativity, arts, language, psychology), diamonds (organization, leadership, logic), clubs (natural sciences) and spades (technology and applied sciences).<br/><br/>Cyber parts of each character are randomly determined by the game master (the &quot;Mastercyb&quot;), but not revealed until the end of the first adventure.<br/><br/>When the Mastercyb judges that an action requires a test, he also deciudes which one is the more relevant attribute. An easy test is considered successful if the player picks up a card of the same value of the attribute or less; for a difficult test it must be of the same colour of the characteristic/skill (for example, black); for a very difficult test it must be of the same suit as well. Court cards have a value of zero. The red joker is the perfect success, the black one the total failure.<br/><br/>&quot;Challenges&quot; between two characters are solved picking a card each and adding the value of the involved attribute/skill. If the picked card is of the same suit of the attribute r skill, its value is doubled.<br/><br/>Experience is also based on playing cards, that are picked up randomly at the end of each adventure. They are the equivalent of instructions for the mechanical parts of the characters' bodies: they can be assembled by the players to program them, gaining extra skills and new powers. Each card value is a different kind of instruction, while each suit matches a different part of the body.<br/><br/>The first of the two adventures is the introductory &quot;Il risveglio&quot; (&quot;The Reawakening&quot;): the characters wake up in a military base in a desert with memories of the XXIV century, and they have to face the intelligent plants that now rule the world. The second one is a sequel, &quot;L'albero della vita&quot; (&quot;The Tree of Life&quot;): characters can become aware that they are in the military base &quot;Louis Bl&eacute;riot&quot; at Forrest Lake, southern Australia, and that it is the 27th of June 2521. They will then have to face some more plants and several robots, one of which is &quot;the Alchemist&quot;. Besides, they can locate a faint radio broadcast coming from 360 km south-west, with a fragment of Dylan's &quot;Blowin' in the wind&quot; repeated at regular intervals.

Martial arts play an important role in the game, that keeps the humorous style especially typical of the first part of the story.<br/><br/>The boardgames have been distributes in Italian newspaper kiosks. At less than 10 euros each, both the full colour boardgames and the RPG have been a successful way to promote the hobby among non-players enthusiasts of Japanese cartoons, that are very popular in Italy since the state television started to broadcast them in 1978.<br/><br/>A quite deep research work has been needed to make those games to depict the world of Dragonball and all its characters. This has been even more difficult since the Italian translations of comic books, TV serials and movies have been different, giving different names to places and people. Besides, the private channel Italia Uno that broadcasted the TV series at national level censored several scenes.<br/><br/>The RPG has a very simple basic system that is explained in just two pages of rules and allows to play the first introductory adventure, &quot;Le Sette Sfere&quot;. <br/>To help beginner players, 16 characters are pre-rolled. They stage the main characters of the cartoon and they can also be used as famous Non Player Charcters (NPCs).<br/><br/>Each character has 4 main characteristics: Strength, Agility, Smartness and Charm. Then there is Defence, that measures the chance of avoiding dangerous things: a mix of dexterity, luck and bulk. And then there is Endurance, that is the capability to stand fatigue and pain: a mix of constitution and willpower. Every character has also a Flaw: Goku has a Out-of-control Hunger, Mr. Satan has Vanity, Olong has Fetishism, Lunch has Double Personality... So, as in the RPG &quot;I cavalieri del tempio&quot;, sometimes the character does what he want, and not what the player wants!<br/><br/>There is also a set of advanced rules, with the indications about how to generate new characters and where the martial arts are especially detailed. Anyway, players wanting more detail can solve combats using the boardgame &quot;Dragonball Z - Il Torneo&quot;.<br/><br/>A long section about the world of Dragonball, its creatures and the famous NPCs from the comics and movies complete the book. The boardgame &quot;Dragonball - Alla ricerca delle sette sfere&quot; provides more encounters and some magic / technological items that can be used by the Game Master to further enrich the adventures.

The setting is strictly historical and the kind of magic available reflects the credible supernatural power that could be believed at that age in the real world. Basic manual start with Middle Ages, but the system allows to feature adventures in any historical period or even in the future.<br/><br/>&quot;I Cavalieri del Tempio&quot; is dedicated to the legend of the Templar Knights. The Templars kningts got esoteric knowledge in the East that allow them to separate their &quot;astral body&quot; from the physical one. Characters are members of a secret and esoteric organization born from the ashes of that order when it has been destroyed by the King of France and the Pope. They start the outermost part of the organization, knowing very little of the real purposes of their missions, and they are sent travel in time and space to direct the course of history follwing a secret &quot;Celestial Plan&quot; of the organization.<br/><br/>Concerning the Templar organization and its plan, &quot;I Cavalieri del Tempio&quot; was quite influenced by Umberto Eco's novel &quot;Il pendolo di Foucault&quot;, that has been published for the first time in Italy in October 1988. The medieval setting of the game is also under the influence of Eco's first novel &quot;Il nome della rosa&quot; - one of the official adventures, included in the supplement &quot;E.Elle Avventura&quot; n.1, is even set in the ruins of Eco's abbey some years after the burning that destroyed it. Another influential writer has been Franco Cuomo with his &quot;Gunther d'Amalfi cavaliere templare&quot;: the authors of the game had fruitful contacts with him while he was writing the nmvel and he also wrote the preface for the second edition of the manual.<br/><br/>The rulebook, in an Old English typeset and with a layout resembling a medieval handwritten code, contains firstly an introduction about role-playing game: a hobby that has never been popular in Italy at mass level, while the book was distributed in regular bookshops all over the country. There is then a detailed introduction to the Templar Knights: the secret and esoteric organization that was born from the ashes of the Templar Order after its trial and destruction.<br/><br/>How to create playing characters is detailed in the &quot;Initiate book&quot;. Each player is provided two different character sheet: he has to develope an &quot;astral body&quot; that is aethernal and will travel from a time to the other, between adventures. The other sheet is for the &quot;physical body&quot; in which the astral one will enter at the beginning of each new adventure, if time and place are different from the previous one.<br/><br/>The astral body has personality traits that can influence the actual mehaviour of the character: this is not totally under the control of the player. A character may speak less or more than his players would like, or panic, or do something really dangerous to save a friend... All according checks n the character traits choosen by the player while defining his character.<br/><br/>The physical body is defined by a collection of skills, used to resolve normal actions and checks. Some esoteric powers, compatible with the historical setting and the secrecy of the organization, belong to the astral body. Checks are made under the value of the attribute or skill, using a growing number of 6-sided dice depending on the difficulty: 3 dice are used for easy checks, up to 6 dice for extreme checks. Trying a check on a skill that the character does not have means adding one more die. If in the dice there are three 6s (the &quot;number of the beast&quot;) means total failure, while three 1s are the perfect roll.<br/><br/>A glossary going from &quot;Abbey&quot; to &quot;Travels&quot; gives all the informatin that the master and the players may need about everyday life in the Middle Ages. Several standard Non Player Characters (NPCs) typical of that age are supplied, and they can also be used as a basis to choose skills when creating PCs. There are also a few historical famous NPCs, that will also have a role in the introductory adventures: &quot;I Trentasei Invisibili&quot;, a mission from the Suth of France to Genoa in Italy, and &quot;Le porte del paradiso&quot;, a sequel that will bring characters up to Verona.

Every player is one of the characters of the play and gets an archetype usually set on a different Shakespearian character. The mix is changed at every game session, that's complete in itself. At the end of the &quot;play&quot;, goals of each specific character are checked and he can be successful or not. But as in every RPG, winning is not the most important thing: the aim of the game is to put together an enjoyable &quot;show&quot; for the virtual public.<br/><br/>But the public is not always virtual. Several rulesets have been developed for &quot;live&quot; games: often with a public, sometime with an active role: &quot;On Stage! schizfrenico&quot;, &quot;On Stage! teatro interattivo&quot;, &quot;On Stage! Vox Populi&quot;. Some f these rules are included in the &quot;Inventare destini&quot; book.<br/><br/>The boxed set contains a 72 pages rulebook. Character sheets. 29 characters' profiles. Game Master control sheet. Cardboard stage. 9 cardboard heros with the main characters of Shakespeare's &quot;Hamlet&quot;. 40+ &quot;Idiomatic sentence&quot; card. Simplified rulebooks for beginner players. Characters' names stands.<br/><br/>The On Stage! basic set is centred on Shakespeare's &quot;Hamlet&quot;, even if the players don't need to know its real polt to enjoy the game. Every one of them, from 5 to 12 people, chooses one of the main characters of the tragedy. Then he secretly chooses one of the possible profiles: for example, Ophelia can choose to be Ophelia the Naive, Ophelia the Lover, Ophelia the Lustful or Ophelia the Instigator. In the latter case, for example, Ophelia has the character of Lady Macbeth (even if the player can ignore that) and wants to push a man to take the throne and make her queen. Hamlet the Rebel, tailored after Brutus, can be an idealist wanting to bring the republic... to Danemark, of course, instead than to Rome. From the mix of the characters, it comes out an every different &quot;Hamlet&quot;.<br/><br/>Every game is divided in acts and scenes: the 5/12 players (7 is the basic number) bid to get the control of every single scene. So they are actually game masters in turn: the winner of the bid decides where the scene is set, who is on stage and can participate to the story in that moment, which characters and Non Player Characters (NPCs) come in and who comes out. The only player with no character, the Director, rules the bidding, checks the secret informations, decides about NPCs and plays them.<br/><br/>The players play their characters as if there was a virtual public looking at them. The characters have three characteristics: Debate, Fight and Luck. When two characters argue or fight, the Director secretly compares the involved characteristic and the character with the higher one, convinces the other or wins the fight, with wounds to the loser depending on the score difference. Each profile has two special abilities that are taken into account by the Director in particular conditions.<br/><br/>Each player gets also three &quot;Idiomatic sentence&quot; cards. They are used to force the will of the scene master, coming in or out of the scene even if he does not want it. Cards are also used to win Debate and Fight confrontations in spite of the characteristic scores, to send accidents to other characters (Luck is used in that case), to put poison or killers or ghosts into scene. Each event must be fit to the story by the player. The humoristic effect is assured also by the title of the card, that is a real &quot;Idiomatic sentence&quot;: the card &quot;Lupus in fabula&quot;, for example, is the one that allows a character that is out of scene to enter if anybody on the scene speaks his name.<br/><br/>A game lasts about 12/15 scenes, for a total of 90/120 minutes.<br/><br/>On Stage! is one of the most innovative role-playing games and his success has been immediate. Even when it was still unpublished, game enthusiasts from all over Italy who had the opportunity to try the game at shows and conventions developed a huge amount of expansions with the most different settings: from Star Wars to Victorian horror, from soap opera to Disney comics. Some of them became official supplements, some have been published on magazines, and many more are available on the web.<br/><br/>On Stage! has been also used in schools and libraries, in educational projects.<br/><br/>"}, "46788": {"rpgitemversion": {"2768": "Saddle Stapled (modules/pamphlets)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Horrible Secret of Monhegan Island", "rpgproducer": {"18379": "Anne Duffy"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic508897.jpg", "usersrated": "6", "rpgsetting": {"2572": "Cthulhu Classic (1920s & 1930s)"}, "average": "5", "rpgissuearticle": {"16993": "Capsule Reviews"}, "rpg": {"310": "Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)"}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpggenre": {"988": "Horror (Cthulhu Mythos)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic508897_t.jpg", "description": "A 1920s scenario for Call of Cthulhu.

Resources are plentiful, the economy is booming, and the capital city of this new world is expanding like never before! Even though many corporations scramble to stake a claim in the exploding prosperity, only one can claim ownership! Who will take over the Infinite City?<br/><br/>Will you place the capital next to the port, claiming both as your own? Will you use the transit station to move another player&rsquo;s military base out of the way, or place your embassy to steal his temple? Will you try for a greater area under your control, or move to capture key buildings?<br/><br/>Infinite City is a standalone tile game in which players become the leaders of corporations building an ever-sprawling city, maneuvering to control the largest districts while holding on to the most valuable buildings.<br/><br/>Infinite City uses tiles to represent buildings, and colored pegs to represent control by players.  The tiles are mixed, five tiles are dealt to each player, and five tiles are placed face down in the shape of a cross at the center of the play area.  On their turns, players play a tile face up adjacent to one of the five starting tiles or a previously played tile, play one of their colored pegs on the tile, and follow the instructions on the tile.  These instructions may lead to playing additional tiles, drawing tiles, moving tiles previously played, turning face down tiles face up, taking tiles from opponents, preventing actions or even exchanging hands of tiles with other players.  When players finish their turns, if they have less than five tiles in their hands, they draw additional tiles so that they end their turn with at least five tiles.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player places the last of his colored pegs, or the fifth Power Station tile is played.

They can be anthropologists, artists, doctors, police, or even zealots, who will explore the mysteries of this huge artificial world and its inhabitants. Basic characters can be humans from a dozen planets of Human Space, Puppeteers, or Kzin. Later play can see characters from Ringworld species, such as the (so-called) Ghouls, Vampires, Giants, Sea People, and others.<br/><br/>Only two publications were ever published, the Ringworld role-playing game box set itself, and the Ringworld Companion, both in 1984 by Chaosium. The magazine Different Worlds, issue 37, featured a Ringworld adventure, &quot;Louis Wu &amp; His Motley Crew.&quot;<br/><br/>The Ringworld role-playing game box set was titled &quot;Larry Niven's Ringworld: Roleplaying Adventure Beneath the Great Arch&quot;, referring to the way the Ringworld looked from its interior surface.

Written by Basic Role-Playing and RuneQuest author Steve Perrin, Superworld began as one third of the Worlds of Wonder product, which also included a generic fantasy setting, &quot;Magic World&quot;, and a generic science fiction setting, &quot;Future World&quot;, all using the same core Basic Role-Playing rules. Only Superworld became a game in its own right.<br/><br/>Superworld is based on the traditional Chaosium Basic Role-Playing system, here augmented by super-powers.<br/><br/>Seven characteristics (Strength, Constitution, Size, Intelligence, Power, Dexterity, Appearance) are rolled with dice (2D6+6, rather the 3d6 used for many other Basic Role-Playing games.) The sum of these characteristics gives a total of Hero Points used to buy super powers.<br/><br/>The super powers system follows the Champions model of powers that are described by their effects. For example, one does not buy &quot;Laser Vision&quot;, but the effect &quot;Energy Blast&quot;, and specifies that it is a laser emitted by the hero's eyes. Each effect can be modified by Advantages (less energy expenditure, for example) or Disadvantages (reduced number of uses, for example) which increase or reduce the cost of a power.<br/><br/>Hero Points can also be used to buy skills, or increase characteristics, for a super-strong character, for example. It is possible to get more Hero Points for character creation by choosing Disabilities for the character, such as Public Identity, Vulnerability to a Substance, Psychological Problems, etc. More Hero Points would be awarded for experience at the end of a game session.<br/><br/>The system functions in the same way as the other Basic Role-Playing games, by rolling percentile dice against skills. Lower rolls than needed can cause increased effect from Specials (equivalent to Impales in RuneQuest), or Criticals, and high rolls can cause critical failures (Fumbles). Combat rules have many options and take into account three types of energy for damage: Kinetic, Electric, and Radiation.<br/><br/>The game box contains three rules booklets, a booklet of character sheets, one of tables for the Gamemaster, a page of cardboard figure silhouettes to be cut out, and a set 6, 8, and 20-sided dice. 1984 printings also contains a 4 page errata booklet.<br/><br/>* The &quot;Superheroes Book&quot; (32 pages) contains character creation rules, the game system itself, and two character sheets with a male and female standing silhouette.<br/>    * The &quot;Superpowers Book&quot; (40 pages) describes the Powers available to the characters, Advantages and Disadvantages that can be applied to them, and Disabilities that can affect the character. The interior covers have two more character sheets, this time with silhouettes of a male and female in flight.<br/>    * The &quot;Gamemasters Book&quot; (40 pages) advises the GM on various aspects of a campaign, the legal system, animals, and the creation of organizations adapted to a superhero universe, with three specific examples: FIRE for Free Investigatory Research Enterprise, FORCE for Federal Organization for the Registration and Certification of Exotics, and the Omega Institute. The &quot;Gamemasters Book&quot; also includes two scenarios: &quot;Deadly Devices of Doctor Dread&quot;, which pits a team of heroes against the Dr. Dread of the title and his subordinates, and &quot;The Haunting&quot;, which describes a mysterious and ancient volume desired by a mystical super-villain.&quot;.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Superworld,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "46837": {"rpgitemversion": {"43605": "Libellus Sanguinis 1: Lenker des Staates PDF"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Libellus Sanguinis 1: Masters of the State", "rpgproducer": {"13940": "Justin Achilli"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic509270.jpg", "usersrated": "15", "rpgsetting": {"1291": "World of Darkness (cWoD Dark Ages)"}, "average": "7.5", "rpgissuearticle": {"154495": "Combined Disciplines for the Long Night"}, "rpggenre": {"1220": "History (Europe)"}, "rpg": {"386": "Vampire: The Dark Ages"}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"1351": "Libellus Sanguinis"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic509270_t.jpg", "description": "These lands are mine, childer; mine for as far as your Cainite eyes can see.

This is a real RPG meant for more than giggles and a couple of con demonstrations.<br/><br/>Elfs offers a genuine innovation for role-playing. I won't bore you with some discourse on &quot;Director stance,&quot; but check out the illustration on the bottom of this page: see what that elf just did? He meant to cut off one goblin's head, but went and cut off that other one's by accident!<br/><br/>That's what the Elfs mechanics do - they permit you to state one outcome or action, and your character to state another.

The piece that emerges determines the car's movement. The arrow means the car moves one space. The numbers depend on the colors. With red numbers, the car moves forward if the car is on a red space. Otherwise, the car moves backwards. The same works for black. The car moves forward with any number if it starts on a white space.

Another player might have Market Manipulation, and use it to drive the &quot;sell&quot; price for Resources down to zero, screwing over Africa. Or, a nation with a Military could take existing stress tokens and rearrange them. When enough stress builds up, bad things happen (minor or major Catastrophes), and whoever has the most of their tokens in that zone takes the blame (and loses VP). Your Military is not actually attacking another player, you're just taking existing global stress and shifting it around to get yourself out of a jam, blame someone else, or both. Your turn consists of production, using abilities, trade, stress and investment, each of which is a very simple action, so turns move pretty quick.<br/><br/>soft landing has some superficial strategies and some more subtle ones.
