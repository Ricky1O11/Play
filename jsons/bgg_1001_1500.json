The Cosmic characters are the heart of the game, providing each player with a special Cosmic power. Each player draws one randomly at game start.<br/><br/>In Cosmic Eidex, the idea is to take either the most points or the least points (designated by the trump and rank of the cards that you take each hand), to earn a victory point. If in a hand, one player exceeds 100 card points, then the other two players get 1 victory point each. If one player takes all of the tricks, she receives 2 victory points. Seven victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>Cosmic Eidex is a mutation of the ages-old Swiss trick-taking card game Jass. Like Skat, the traditional German trick-taking card game, it is a three-player game.<br/><br/>The Cosmic-like powers each player is given are relatively weak. Most allow the player to break one of the rules once per game (before, during or after), some can be used multiple times. You don&rsquo;t need to know every characters' powers, just the powers of the three characters used in the current game.

This way you can both enable yourself to play more tiles during your turn and force your opponent to play tiles that continue your track (remember that your opponent's hand is open, so try to create required spaces that take advantage of his tiles).<br/><br/>The full version contains 56 tiles.<br/><br/>Note that there are also smaller solo brain teaser puzzles that are Outside the Scope of BGG. The 10-tile version is a color matching puzzle. Arrange the tiles so that all the colored lines match where the tiles touch each other. Additionally, for each puzzle challenge, select one color, and create a closed loop. Begin the easy puzzle by using the first four tiles (which are numbered on the reverse side 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4).

The game is turn based and the phasing player, after moving his car, must set the gear for next turn. The box strategy is the most important decision to take. You can decide to complete all the 3 laps without stopping or making one or two pitstops.<br/>The game is not a &quot;simulation&quot;, but to win you need a good amount of skill.

If you exceed the curve's speed limit, you lose &quot;tyres points&quot;. Of course, you can simulate a championship playing different circuits. What's interesting is that the game strategy changes from circuit to circuit and if you design your own circuit you need all your &quot;driving skill&quot; to be competitive.

In Gunslinger, you play the part of a western character who is caught in a sudden gunfight, and you face the split-second decisions and incidents of the showdown as bullets start to fly.<br/><br/>Gunslinger is based on a quick and easy game system that recreates the split-second nature of gunplay. Each turn the players secretly play cards to define exactly what they will do during the next two seconds in the game. Then they step through these actions on the playing map, resolving each shot in the split-second when it takes place. Gunslinger resolves combat quickly and easily. The attacker draws a result card that shows exactly where his shot hits, which combines with his gun to determine the damage he inflicts. This recreates the critical differences between weapons: Winchesters, Shotguns, Buffalo rifles, Colt's &quot;Peacemaker&quot;, Smith &amp; Wesson's breakopen guns and Remington's Derringer are a few of the guns in the game.<br/><br/>Gunslinger includes eight two-sided boards (a total of sixteen map faces) portraying town and countryside terrain at a scale of six feet per hex. These boards can be assembled in varying ways to create a vast number of different maps that are used in the gunfights. The terrain includes gullies, hills, trees, watering troughs, wells, hitching posts and the interiors of buildings.<br/><br/>Gunslinger presents 26 different gunfights and several hundred variations, including both historical gunfights and made-up situations. Wild Bill Hickok, Billy the Kid, Wyatt Earp, and John Wesley Hardin are just a few of the real gunslingers of history who appear in re-creations of the gunfights that made them famous.

Exception, if a tower has six balls only five balls may be placed on the other five pieces and so one ball is lost and is removed from the game.<br/><br/>3.Capturing: Only balls are captured, not pieces. The capturing piece and the threatened piece stay on their own squares. Example a white piece and a brown piece stand two squares apart. They have two balls and three balls respectively. It is whites move and white can remove the three brown balls from the game as long as there is no piece between the white and brown pieces.

Each group respects the other and doesn&rsquo;t make things too difficult or too easy.<br/><br/>The start of the game<br/><br/>The two groups sit apart from each other so that they cannot see the other half of the board, preferably on two separate tables.<br/><br/>Each group sorts their cards.  The green cards and the grey cards are separated.   At first only the green cards are used, as well as the Gigi and Beppo cards.<br/><br/>Each Group now lays a selected card, with a dream picture showing,  on a space on the board.

For each question mark on the path, the group thinks up their own imaginary picture.<br/>The other group listens carefully and tries to remember the story.<br/><br/>After the two stories have been told, the grey cards are placed on the empty squares of the board (colored pictures face up). The whole board is now full of dream pictures and question marks, and the original path is no longer clear.<br/><br/>The two groups come together and put the two halves of the board together.  Each group now positions itself by the other half of the board and will soon move the figure which goes with that half.<br/><br/>Momo and Kassiopeia run through the city<br/><br/>At last Momo and Kassiopeia set off.  Each group moves their figure in turn onto an adjacent space.  It is important that all the players should participate by recalling the story they heard and they should all agree which space the figure should move to.<br/>Before either Momo or Kassiopeia are placed on a new card, the card is turned over.  If the underside is green the card remains turned and the figure steps onto it.  But if it is grey, the world ,once again, becomes a little colder, and an hour flower is taken to the time-store of the grey men.  Master Hora's flower is left until last.<br/>Momo and Kassiopeia may not step on the grey cards.<br/><br/>Gigi and Beppo help Momo and Kassiopeia.  If a group finds one of the friends, this group may expose any chosen card.  In this case no flower need be given up if the chosen card is grey.<br/><br/>When Momo or Kassiopeia reach the gate to the never-alley,  they wait there for each other and go together to Master Hora.  Master Hora gives them his flower and so Momo and Kassiopeia free all the captured flowers.  The flowers are given back to the people.  Together you have won the game.

The object of the game is to win the pot which contains all the bets the players have made in a deal.  Players are dealt cards which are usually reduced to a Poker hand of five (5) cards. Betting and bluffing are used in rounds until all bets are squared up, or until all other players have conceded the pot (folded). If all bets have been squared up, the rounds are followed by a &quot;showdown&quot; in which all hands are fully revealed; the one with the best combination of a Poker hand of five (5) cards being the winner.<br/><br/>The following table describes and ranks the standard Poker hands:<br/><br/>Five of a Kind (Only if wild cards are in use):  Four cards of the same rank and one wild card (eg: A, A, A, A, Joker).<br/>Straight Flush: A straight with all cards of the same suit (eg: A, K, Q, J, 10: all spades). (The highest Straight Flush is nominally called a Royal Flush)<br/>Four of a Kind:  Four cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, A, A, K).<br/>Full House:  Three of a kind in one rank and a pair in a different rank (eg: A, A, A, K, K). <br/>Flush:  Five cards of the same suit (eg: A, K, Q, J, 9: all spades)<br/>Straight:  Five cards in sequence of rank (eg: A, K, Q, J, 10).<br/>Three of a Kind:  Three cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, A, K, Q).<br/>Two Pair:  Two pairs of different ranks (eg: A, A, K, K, Q).<br/>One Pair:  A pair of cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, K, Q, J).<br/>High Card:  High card without any other higher combination (eg: A, K, Q, J, 9).<br/><br/>Poker has many variants.  The two main forms of Poker are: Stud Poker and Draw Poker.<br/><br/>In Draw Poker, all cards are dealt face down to each player.  One of the most played  versions of Draw Poker is Five (5) card Draw Poker (often shown in TV and Motion Pictures).  Each player is dealt five (5) cards.  There is a betting interval, and those left in the deal, may trade cards in their hand for new cards from the stock (IE: Discard two cards, and receive two new cards from the dealer).  There is then a final betting interval before the showdown.<br/><br/>In Stud Poker, some of the cards are dealt face down, and some are exposed for all players to see.  One of the most common games of Stud Poker is Seven (7) card Stud Poker.  Each player is dealt two cards face down and one card face up.  After the first betting interval, each remaining player is dealt another card face up.  This continues two more times, with a betting interval before each deal, until all players that remain have two cards face down, and four cards face up.  Each player then receives a final card face down, and there is a final betting interval before the showdown.<br/><br/>Currently, one of the most popular versions of Poker is a version of Stud Poker called Texas Hold'Em.<br/><br/>No-Limit Texas Hold'Em is the version used in The World Series of Poker each year.  Each player is dealt two cards face down.  After a betting interval, three community cards are dealt face up at the same time.  There is another betting interval, and another community card is dealt face up; after another betting interval, another community card is dealt face up.

The object of the game is to travel to the end of the dungeon and open the Warlock's treasure chest.  Along the way players must deduce the correct combination of three keys which will open the chest, and find or steal the appropriate keys.  This is done through a mechanic exactly like Parker Brother's Clue game: you ask players if they have any key cards of a particular number and secretly note down what their answers are.

In order to survive and flourish, they had to evolve, and to do it quickly!<br/><br/>In Evo, you control the survival and evolution of a species of dinosaurs called Dinos.

At the end of the game, you and your Dinos will not be the winners unless you've evolved more quickly and successfully than everyone else.<br/><br/>Each turn is divided into six phases, in which Dinos move, fight, reproduce and evolve to ensure that their species has the characteristics to survive the various perils of  prehistoric life.

Players are big investors (and I mean big - the smallest notes are $50 million and billions of dollars change hands) and wheeler-dealers.<br/><br/>Players acquire shares in companies, primarily randomly (picked up as cards), but also possibly through purchase of other players' previous sales. To form the companies they must also acquire resources, which are bought from 4 sets. The pricing mechanism for these is like Palmyra and McMulti - each purchase increases the price and each sale decreases it. Once an appropriate set is acquired for a matching set of (at least two) shares in a company, the company can be formed. Companies pay income to their owners each turn. They can also be sold off at a premium, or split up (provided the owner has enough shares and resources) to gain double income. The real heart of the game comes in the option to conduct hostile takeovers. A player lays one or more shares in a company owned by another player and then starts a bidding war to takeover the company. Each player is bidding to buy the shares of the opponent (bids are per share). The &quot;winner&quot; gets the company and all the shares, the &quot;loser&quot; is paid off at the final bid price. Who is actually the winner and loser depends, of course, on the balance of the final price.<br/><br/>There is a sudden death variable finish, when assets plummet in value, so there is a tense few final rounds when players can try to realize assets while they are still valuable.

A player may pay a certain number of 'beans' to refuse a block and it gets passed to the next player.  When a player's structure falls, they are out of the game.  Last player standing wins.<br/><br/>Description of Bandu (1992, Milton Bradley, 2-6 players):<br/>Bandu is based upon the game of Bausack. Each player is given a base block and a number of beans. During a turn, a player chooses a wood block from a common supply and either holds a Refuse or Use auction. All player bid with their beans and the winner/loser must place the piece on their tower. If your tower falls you are out of the game. The last tower standing wins.<br/><br/>Description of Sac Noir (Rio Grande Games, 2-8 players):<br/>There are five variations on how to play. The goal in all of them is to build a tower. The bag contains very different wooden pieces (i.e. an ashlar, an egg, a ring, a fir tree etc.) as well as a sack of beans for the &quot;auction variation&quot; of the game. Depending on the variation you choose, either each player builds his own tower or all build one together. The &quot;auction variations&quot; are the most suspenseful and surprising. One might end up spending quite some beans to avoid building an especially difficult element. Gambling and bluffing abilities are needed just as much as a feeling for statics and construction skills. It's a game with almost endless building possibilities. It's a challenge for steady hands and shaky suspense for clever tacticians.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Competo edition with 2009 award logos", "Competo Scandinavian edition", "Milton Bradley English edition", "Milton Bradley French Edition", "Venner\u00f8d English edition", "Zoch Deluxe Edition", "Zoch linen bag edition", "Zoch multilanguage edition", "Zoch second edition"], "average": "6.88026", "name": "Bausack", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding"], "age": "7", "boardgameexpansion": ["Bausack: Extension Kit"], "usersrated": "3274", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games", "Party Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["3D Games"]}, "1232": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Peter Lewe"], "average": "5.45704", "poll": [], "name": "Saludos Amigos!", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": ["Partnerships"], "yearpublished": "1996", "usersrated": "71", "maxplayers": "7", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic451299_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Franz Vohwinkel"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Goldsieber Spiele"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic451299.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Goldsieber German Edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Negotiation", "Political"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Saludos Amigos! is a light-hearted negotiation game.

Spring in the hight country enters with a wash of fresh green and the warming chinook, while the show still lies deep on the mountain peaks. As the snow recedes, wild flowers of every hue splash across the lush meadows of the Northern Rockies. The small life in burrow and den creep forth, the birds sing loudly in the pines. Spring is the true beginning of the new year in the awakening wilderness of the Yellowstone.<br/><br/>The old buck raises his head and turns his gaze to the horizon. The time has come - now to lead the herd to the summer pasture where the bounty of this land will drive away the hunger of winter past. But other animals have come forth from their dens with the spring - the coyote, grizzly bear, mountain lion, and the deadliest predator of all - Man. The natural dangers of this magnificent, rugged land loom ahead. Yet the herd, to prosper, must take to the well-worn trail, seeking to cross the migratory paths of the other grazing masses. As the young gambol and explore, every instinct of the old buck must be devoted to the trek. Without hesitation, he takes the first step toward the future.<br/><br/>Yellowstone is a less complex game dealing with moving your herd from Winter Pasturage to Summer Pasturage back to Winter Pasturage.  Players control one of the following herds: bison, elk, sheep, or mule deer.  Along the way, you try to pick up Food Points and avoid predators.  You can move the animals in your herd a certain number of hexes in a turn; males are the fastest, females are a bit slower, babies are really slow and should be accompanied by females.  However, when you finally get back to Winter Range, you score more for babies and females than you do for males -- so you may find it necessary to sacrifice a male or two to predators.  Predators are controlled by your opponents, but you get to control them on your turn.  They are not major threats, but inducement to keep moving.  Collect those food points!  You'll need them for winter.<br/>The game's map centers on the Yellowstone Park area and some of the land south of there.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "name": "Yellowstone", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System"], "average": "5.56595", "usersrated": "195", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Bears", "Animals: Coyote", "Animals: Deer", "Animals: Sheep"]}, "1236": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic11552.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Volker Sch\u00e4fer"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1998", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Christof Tisch"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Bambus Spieleverlag", "Regenbogen"], "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic11552_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Dice", "Memory"], "description": "Publisher's description:<br/><br/>Juggling clowns which have brightly coloured wooden balls inside them move across the board.

Each hand, players bid for Trump, and then the partnership that won the bid must make the amount of points bid in the hand.  Play of each trick is similar to Whist games like Bridge. The card led must be followed by a card of the same color.  A player may play a trump color if they have none of the color led.  The highest card of the color led wins the trick, unless the trick is trumped, and then the highest trump wins the trick.  The Rook card can be played at any time, and always wins the trick.  Unlike Whist or Bridge, the amount of tricks is not important, but certain count cards (5's, 10's, 14's, and the Rook card) taken in tricks are worth points, which is how the game is scored.<br/><br/>The standard game is 4-player, but there are variants for 2-player and 3-player in the rules, and there also are many variations and house rules used in play.<br/><br/>Rook has also been referred to as Missionary Poker.

Players must move to a room and then make an accusation against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon.  The player to the left must show one of any cards accused to the accuser if in that player's hand.  Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file.  To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more accusations.

The two players are the Corp (who wins by completing Agendas) and the Runner (who wins by infiltrating the Corp and liberating Agendas).<br/><br/>Each side has a limited number of both actions and bits (money) to spend per turn; bits are gone once used, and actions must be spent to gain more.<br/>An important thing when evaluating the power of cards is to see the Bit per action ratio.<br/><br/>One unique feature of this game is that the Runner physically moves on the &quot;board&quot; created by facedown Corp cards.  It has the feel of a &quot;capture the flag&quot; game, with the Runner moving in dataforts to steal Agendas from the Corp.<br/><br/>Another unique feature is that the Cards are NOT the primary strategy of the game; in fact, players can win by simply &quot;playing with the rules&quot; itself (a concept difficult to understand if you've never played Netrunner).<br/><br/>Both players play as both Corp and Runner in a game, one after the other, with each player's Runner going against the opponent's Corp.  A winning match provides 10 points and the loser scores points equal to the number of agenda points scored/liberated. The winner of the game is the one who has the most points in the 2 submatches.<br/><br/>Though Netrunner is traditionally a two-player duel, there are formats that allow for more players (called &quot;The Big Sell Out&quot;).<br/><br/>Richard Garfield himself considered Netrunner as his best boardgame design instead of CCG design game, and he loves games that include bluffing mechanics; with Netrunner, bluffing is an integral part of the game.<br/><br/>When it was released in 1996, many gaming magazines gave Netrunner critical acclaim as the best CCG ever designed.

Since the money hasn't yet come in, these rough-tough folk are hired merely with pieces of paper - IOUs. But on pay day the IOUs come due, and if a player can't pay off debts, then the vultures swoop in.<br/><br/>Players bid for adventurer cards that will be used in various events - Gold Fever, High Noon, and the Poker Game. Each adventurer carries a number (a rating) for each of the three events. When it's time to play out an event, players place an adventurer card face down. All players simultaneously turn the cards over. The adventurer with the highest number pertaining to the event wins; the lowest loses (ties are usually kept as ties, with both receiving the benefits or penalties). In Gold Fever the winner and second highest receive gold, which may be exchanged for prestige points or used to pay off debts. In High Noon, the winner gets to pick back up two IOUs (not necessarily his or her own); the loser is shot and loses the adventurer card. Also the undertaker advances one space along a timing track. In the Poker Game, the winner moves forward on the prestige track; the loser moves backwards. The IOU cards used in bids for the adventurers are placed in rows along the board, each beside one of six dice symbols (showing 1 through 6).

The player who owns that IOU must pay up. This continues until either all cards of one die symbol have been turned up, or a player cannot meet a debt. The unfortunate player in this case gets a vulture chip and moves back 5 spaces on the prestige track.

As the desert grows, cultivation cards may develop the plant tiles further, making them more valuable and bringing players much manna. The player who first gets tiles valued at 20 &quot;fertility points&quot; on the board wins. But watch out! As the desert blooms competition for the land increases, and other players will try to take your most fertile land away.<br/><br/>The game play in Eden is simple. Either play one or two irrigation cards to develop areas of desert (i.e. place tiles on the board), or play a cultivation card to increase the value of areas already on the board (i.e. replace existing tiles with more valuable ones, at a cost), or pass. Conflict enters the game when a player places a new tile on the board next to an opponent's existing tile. Then a challenge may be made by the player placing the tile. Manna, the currency in the game, is used in the challenge, which takes the form of a bidding war. Bids, which must be divisible by 5, are always increased. But what the winning bidder actually must pay is the bid MULTIPLIED by the value of the tiles that would be gained. In the case of the challenger, the winning bid would be the bid itself times the value of the tiles sought. In the case of the defender, the winning bid would be the bid itself times the value of the tiles the defender is using in what in effect is an attack. Bids keep rising until one player is unwilling, or unable, to meet the final cost of a bid. The loser forfeits all the tiles involved in the conflict, but gains the value of that land (according to the bid) in manna from the other player.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "5.62485", "name": "Eden", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Tile Placement"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "169", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games", "Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Spiele f\u00fcr viele"]}, "1337": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Serge Cahu"], "poll": [], "name": "Traboulet", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1997", "usersrated": "123", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic74555_t.jpg", "average": "6.2752", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Fun Connection", "Patch Products"], "boardgamefamily": ["Marble Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic74555.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch edition", "Patch version 1997"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Similar to Abalone, Traboulet has marbles to be pushed singly or in rows along an open 7x7 grid of holes.

Now each player uses the  4 safe cards: 3 with the picture &quot;Boxo Asleep Break-in Succeeded&quot; and 1 with the picture &quot;Boxo Awake Pants Torn.&quot; to put his treasures in the safes. Players turn over the top 4 treasure cards from their stacks and put them in the middle of the table, side by side so that all players can see their values.

They use a trick indicator card to declare the number of tricks they expect to take. If they're right, they get a bonus. It's also up to the players to decide whether they will openly announce the tricks they expect to take or whether they keep it secret. But beware! A face-up trick indicator card increases the possibility that the other players will be able to influence the outcome.

The color of this card is the trump color. After distributing the cards, players take the playing cards into their hand. Each player now judges for himself how many tricks he thinks he can take. Players select the appropriate card from their trick indicator cards and place it face-down in front of themselves<br/><br/>Once all players have made their decision, the dealer, starting with the player to his left, asks each player if he wants to openly announce the number of tricks he plans to take (by turning over his trick indicator card) or if he wishes to keep it secret. Once each player has indicated his decision, the dealer asks the other players in clockwise order until all players, including the dealer have indicated their decision. Turning over the trick indicator card brings a higher risk but also potentially more points.<br/><br/>Rules of play:<br/><br/>Players must follow suit (play the same color as the card that was lead) if it is possible for them to do so.<br/><br/>If a player cannot follow suit, he has two possibilities:<br/>1. Play trump - play a card of the trump color<br/>2. Throw off - play a card that is neither the trump color nor the color that was lead.

Income is gained by other players visiting their properties and money is spent when they visit properties belonging to other players. When times get tough, players may have to mortgage their properties to raise cash for fines, taxes and other misfortunes.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>On his turn, a player rolls two dice and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio or allow the bank to auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.<br/><br/>Goal<br/>The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money.<br/><br/>Cultural impact on rules<br/>Monopoly is unusual in that the game has official, printed rules, but most players learn how to play from others, never actually learning the correct way to play. This has led to the canonization of a number of house rules that make the game more palatable to children (and sore losers) but harm the gameplay by preventing players from going bankrupt or slowing down the rate of property acquisition. One common house rule has players put any money paid to the bank in the center of the board, which jackpot a player may earn by landing on Free Parking. This prevents the game from removing money from play, and since players collect $200 each time they pass Go, this results in ever-increasing bankrolls and players surviving rents that should have bankrupted them. Another house rule allows players to take &quot;loans&quot; from the bank instead of going bankrupt, which means the game will never end. Some house rules arise out of ignorance rather than attempts to improve the game. For instance, many players don't know that properties landed on but left unbought go up for auction, and even some that know to auction don't know that the bidding starts at $1, meaning a player may pay well below the listed price for an auctioned property.<br/><br/>Background<br/>In the USA in 1933, Charles Darrow devised Monopoly based on an earlier game by Elizabeth J. Magie. The patent was filed 31st August 1935 while the game was on sale in America. Based on an earlier game, The Landlord's Game, it was at first rejected by Parker Bros., as being too complicated to be a success. How wrong could they be! It came to the UK in 1936, made under licence by Waddingtons. Darrow died in 1967 having realised he had developed one of the most successful board games of all times. It was awarded as Game of the Century by the TRA (Toy Retailers Association).<br/><br/>Monopoly was patented in 1935 by Charles Darrow and released by Parker Brothers. The game was actually one of a number of variants in existence at the time, all of which date back to an earlier, 1904 game by Elizabeth J. Magie called The Landlord's Game. Magie was a proponent of the Single Tax put forth by famous author Henry George.  The game was designed to show the evils of earning money from renting land (as it leads to the destitution of all but one player) and the virtues of the proposed Single Tax - players could choose to play under regular rules or alternate &quot;Single Tax&quot; rules.<br/><br/>The game didn't really go anywhere and Magie lost interest in it. Variations of the game evolved, however, and homemade versions traveled up and down the Atlantic coast and even as far west as Michigan and Texas, being developed all along the way. Eventually the game was noticed by Charles Darrow, who introduced it to the world in its current form.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    The Landlord's Game<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/>Official<br/><br/>    Monopoly Stock Exchange Add-on<br/>    Monopoly Free Parking Mini Game<br/>    Monopoly Get Out of Jail Mini Game<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Unofficial<br/><br/>    Super Add-ons: Monopoly<br/>    Entrepreneur's Accessory to Monopoly<br/>    Game Spice: Monopoly Expansion<br/>    Mafiopoly<br/>    Monopoly: Mob Rule Expansion Deck<br/>    Final Fantasy Monopoly<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Alga Danish edition 1999", "Alga Swedish Ber\u00f6mda white edition 1976", "Alga Swedish blue scaffold edition", "Alga Swedish first edition 1936", "Alga Swedish yellow scaffold edition", "Barnes & Noble Onyx edition 2006", "Borras Plana Spanish edition 1985 (square box)", "Brohm-Parker edition 1975", "Brohm-Parker German edition 1974", "Brohm-Parker-Spiele German 1960's edition", "Carlit edition 1950", "Carlit Franz Carl Weber Red Edition", "Carlit Zurich - Switzerland edition", "Carlit Z\u00fcrich edition 1968", "Clipper / Parker Brothers Dutch edition 1976", "Clipper Dutch 45th Anniversary edition 1980", "Clipper Dutch edition", "Clipper Dutch Edition W9 1976", "Damm/Egmont '265' edition", "Darrow Black Box (Small)", "Darrow White Box (Large)", "Darrow/Parker edition 1935", "Deska Dutch edition (square box)", "Drechsler Danish Fifth Edition De Luxe", "Drechsler Danish first edition 1936", "Drechsler Danish Fourth edition", "Drechsler Danish fourth edition", "Drechsler Danish Third edition", "Editrice Giochi Italian 40th Anniversary edition", "Editrice Giochi Italian edition 1946", "Editrice Giochi Italian edition 1981", "Editrice Giochi Italian first edition 1936", "Editrice Giochi Italian Milan edition 1981", "Edwards Dunlop And Company Limited English edition", "Epoch Japanese edition", "Fenno-Alga Finnish edition w/ pewter playing pieces", "Fenno-Alga Finnish edition w/ plastic playing pieces", "First Edition", "First edition", "Franz Schmidt German Silver edition", "Franz Schmidt German White Square Edition", "French edition 1961", "Funskool English edition 1996", "General Mills Edition", "Greek edition", "Hasbrio nostalgia tin edition", "Hasbro / Parker Brothers 65th Anniversary Edition", "Hasbro 70th Anniversary edition", "Hasbro 80th Anniversary edition 2014", "Hasbro Canadian edition", "Hasbro Cat token edition", "Hasbro Catalan edition 2008", "Hasbro Crooks & Castles Collector's edition 2013", "Hasbro English bookshelf edition 2006", "Hasbro English Grab & Go edition 2014", "Hasbro English Target Exclusive Golden Token Edition 2012", "Hasbro FAO Schwarz 150th Anniversary edition 2012", "Hasbro Finnish edition 1996", "Hasbro Hungarian edition 2006", "Hasbro Italian Regole Fai Da Te edition 2013", "Hasbro Korean edition 2011", "Hasbro Moneybag token edition 1999", "Hasbro Twin Play Classics Edition with Scrabble", "Hasbro UK Miniature Cracker Edition", "Hasbro Vintage Collection wooden box edition", "Hasbro/ Parker Brothers speed die edition", "Hasbro/Parker Brothers English Red Speed Die Edition 2008", "Hasbro/Parker Greek travel edition 1994", "Icelandic First Edition", "Irish edition 1990", "Jinlilai Chinese edition", "Joker Danish De Luxe edition", "Joker Danish edition", "Majora Portuguese first edition", "MIKA Greek edition", "Miro French edition 1936", "Miro French edition 1961", "N.V.

You need to be careful though, since this also will end the game! On the other hand, you do get some bonus points for being the First Accuser.<br/><br/>Cards are passed after each player's turn. For the first round it is only one, but it increases by 1 for every round the game lasts.<br/><br/>Once someone decides to accuse, all players can make any guesses they want to, filling in the answers they've come up with for each category (Suspect, Place, Weapon, Emotion).  You can also fill in the specific answer within a category for more points.

Set in Northern Italy during a period of rapid political change (borders for playable hexes change twice during the course of the game) the game is one of the most difficult even for experienced 18xx players.<br/><br/>The greatest innovations center on the ability of companies to own shares in other public companies and the merging of companies. Train obsolescence is rapid and unforgiving, and it is quite possible for forced-purchase trains to be obsolete before they get a chance to run. Capitalization is on a per-share basis throughout the game and train prices are steep &gt;1400 for an 8 train - the largest.<br/><br/>There are 8 historical corporations and eight, named but ahistorical &quot;generic&quot; corporations. These are normally used simply as investment vehicles to maximize the amount of capital available to &quot;successful&quot; companies close to Milan. Northern Italy is mountainous, especially near the off-board Alpine areas and to the South of the map, making progress slow and expensive for the outlying historical companies.<br/><br/>1841 has a reputation as a very long game, but is not necessarily much longer than games, such as 1870, which have a very large bank. It can be completed in four hours.<br/><br/>Chris Lawson's game kit is one version that is available and is of his usual high (for a game kit) quality. A large amount of time with scissors and craft knife to cut out the stock and tiles can be expected.  Deep Thought Games now publishes 1841v2 which incorporates changes by Manlio Manzini to address some of the perceived shortcomings with the original which was designed by Federico Vellani with Manlio as a co-author.<br/><br/>Description by Steve Thomas:<br/><br/>1841 is the 18xx game of choice for many players, though some hate it. Designed, and originally published as 1839 by Federico Vellani, it is set in northern Italy. The McGuffin here is that 1841 is the 18xx game which is least about actually building a railway and most about manipulating the stock market and managing the extremely fierce train obsolescence. Route development has its place, but unless the players can get the rest of the game about right they are doomed, and it is this which polarizes players' views of the game. When it first became available it whetted the slightly jaded palates of some players since the dividing line between success and abject failure is so narrow. 1841 achieves this by allowing companies to buy and sell shares in each other, and to merge with one another. These factors result in frequent and hard-to-predict changes to the order in which the companies operate.

In each round, players are dealt a hand of cards &mdash; one card in the first round, two cards in the second, three in the third, etc. &mdash; then trump is determined by flipping the top card of the undealt deck; if a suit is revealed, that suit is trump, while if a Wizard or Jester (or no card in the final round) is revealed, then the round has no trump. Players then state how many tricks they expect to win in the round.<br/><br/>The playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads a suited card, then all other players must follow suit, if possible. If a player leads a Jester, then the second player determines the suit led. If a player leads a Wizard, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases a player may always play a Wizard or Jester, even if they hold cards in the suit led.<br/><br/>After each player has played a card, determine the winner of the trick as follows: If one or more Wizards were played, the player of the first Wizard wins the trick, collects the cards, and leads to the next trick. If not, whoever played the highest trump wins the trick. If not, whoever played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. If all players played Jesters, whoever played the first Jester wins.<br/><br/>After all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matched their bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, they score 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If a player missed their bid, they lose 10 points for each trick that they were off, whether they took more or fewer than predicted.<br/><br/>A common variant in Wizard is to not allow the total number of tricks bid in a round to match the round number, thereby forcing (at least) one player to be off each round.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["999 Games Dutch edition 2011", "AMIGO 30 Jahre edition", "AMIGO edition 1996", "AMIGO edition 1996 with extended logo", "AMIGO edition 2005 in tin box", "AMIGO edition 2005 in tin box, 500 numbered copies", "AMIGO edition 2010", "AMIGO German 15th anniversary tin edition", "AMIGO German edition 2011", "AMIGO German Jubilee edition 2016", "AMIGO German travel edition 2011", "Bulgarian first edition", "Canada Games deluxe edition 1996", "Canada Games edition 1995", "Canada Games large packaging edition 1994", "Copag Brazilian edition 2013", "Fisher Black Box edition 1984", "Gift edition", "Gigamic French tin-box edition", "Japanese first edition", "Kadabra Lithuanian edition", "Kaissa Greek edition", "Kaissa Greek edition 2009", "Laser plus Slovenian edition", "Lautapelit.fi edition 2009", "Modiano Italian edition", "Morapiaf edition 1995", "Piatnik Hungarian edition", "Piatnik Hungarian second edition", "Piatnik Hungarian third edition", "Swan Panasia Chinese and South East Asian Languages edition", "Swan Panasia Chinese second edition", "U.S. Games blue box slipcover edition", "U.S. Games blue pegboard box", "U.S. Games Canadian edition", "U.S. Games Canadian edition 2011", "U.S. Games deluxe edition 1997", "U.S. Games deluxe edition 2004", "U.S. Games deluxe edition 2010", "U.S. Games edition", "U.S. Games edition 2009", "U.S. Games edition 2011", "U.S. Games English/Spanish slipcover edition", "U.S. Games Large Index edition 2011", "U.S. Games Let's play edition", "U.S. Games Medieval edition 2011", "U.S. Games Pegboard Edition"], "average": "6.89102", "name": "Wizard", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Betting/Wagering", "Hand Management", "Trick-taking"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["Brettspiel Adventskalender 2015", "Wizard: The Christmas Wizards"], "usersrated": "5327", "boardgameaccessory": ["Wizard: Coins"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Wizard"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["RJ30: Shopping victorious"]}, "1466": {"boardgamedesigner": ["John Bohrer"], "poll": [], "name": "Rebel Rails", "playingtime": "150", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pick-up and Deliver"], "yearpublished": "2001", "usersrated": "19", "boardgamefamily": ["Winsome Essen Sets"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic295923_t.jpg", "average": "5.39474", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Winsome Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic295923.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "150", "boardgamecategory": ["American Civil War", "Economic", "Trains", "Transportation"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "150", "description": "Run the Confederate railway network as the Union army descends upon the South.

Each time you successfully answer a question, you get a piece of your pyramid, provided you answered with the required &quot;precision&quot;. The answers are given based on the map provided, so your answer is basically a geographical area which you feel applies to the question or statement.<br/><br/>The game is supplied with a reticle (map-reader), which provides you with the letter needed if you want to answer with &quot;triangular precision&quot;.  So you must answer with a number (for hexagonal precision) or a number and a letter (for triangular).  The four sides of the pyramid are earned by answering a question with triangular precision, one for each zone on the map (Americas, Europe, Water, and Universal - which is Africa, Asia and the other 3 zones).<br/><br/>The rubi (top of the pyramid) is earned by first having the four sides done, then answering a final question.

As the thief, you secretly plot your movements around a private art museum.  As you go, the detectives take turns trying to find you with their eyes, the video cameras, or motion detectors.  You can deactivate the cameras, and you can even cut off the power to the entire museum to mask your movements.  Another advantage is that the thief gets a turn after every detective's individual turn.<br/><br/>Another problem for the detectives is the fact that, once the thief has picked up a painting, she can take her next turn before removing the painting from the gameboard.  The good guys know the vicinity, but won't know her exact location, as the thief is now up to 3 squares away from that spot. If a detective ever spots you with the naked eye, secret movement is over, and the thief's token is placed on the board for all to see.  This can get frantic, since the thief can only move 1-3 spaces, while detectives roll a d6 for movement!<br/><br/>The thief player has to decide when to attempt a getaway. The catch is, some of the windows and doors are locked.  There are actual lock pieces, and you must flip over the one you are attempting to open (instant detective frenzy!). If she has stolen 3 paintings (in a one-off game), and manages to get out, she wins.  In a tournament style game, each player gets a turn at being the thief, so the number of paintings needed will vary based on the other players' scores.<br/><br/>1991 Mensa Select<br/><br/>Also selected by Family Fun Magazine as one of the best games.<br/><br/>Original name by inventors was Heist.
