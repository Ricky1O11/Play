The Roolerz now take their positions as least powerful, yet most valuable cards in their respective trumps.<br/><br/>Gameplay proceeds like most other trick taking games. Ordinarily, the highest card in the lead suit wins the trick. The only exception is when trump is played. In that case, the highest trump card wins the trick.<br/><br/>The blank card may be played at any time, regardless of what suit was led or how many cards of that suit the player has.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, points are tallied. Points are only given to players who have the following cards: 15 (scores 15 points), 14 (scores 10 points), 10 (scores 10 points), 5 (scores 5 points), and the two Rooler cards (30 points each). All other cards are worth zero points.<br/><br/>A team is set if it fails to win as many points as it bid. The first team to reach 1000 points wins.<br/><br/>For 2-, 3-, and 5-player games use a dummy hand. In 4-player games there are two teams of two, and in 6-player games, there are two teams of three.<br/><br/>"}, "10543": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jim Dunnigan"], "poll": [], "name": "The Drive on Metz (first edition)", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "yearpublished": "1980", "usersrated": "30", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic328714_t.jpg", "average": "5.68833", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["William Morrow & Co."], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic328714.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["William Morrow & Co.

The main feature of the Emotrions line is that it introduces the issue of Emotional Intelligence into a sector traditionally focused on the development of analytical intelligence.<br/><br/>EmotrionsOnCards is a really entertaining and addictive game. It's also easy to learn due to its few and consistent rules. There's a conscious balance between a distillate simplicity, which makes it possible for everybody to play in a more relaxed - &quot;light&quot; - manner, and a depth of game which will satisfy the classic strategy game hard players.<br/><br/>In EmotrionsOnCards, the cards, called emotrions, represent the basic human feelings: love, hatred, joy, sadness, fury, indecision... Some emotrions score points, others take them away. And they keep intermingling in your hand, when playing each trick, and even when you win!<br/><br/>It is very powerful as a strategy game. The miracle lays in its innovative logic, with negative and positive playing cards.<br/><br/>With only 36 cards and some minimal rules you'll be able to unfold many complex and shady situations. And you can also play different games with the same set of cards, such as The Pareo Game.<br/><br/>Strategy, psychology and luck <br/>EmotrionsOnCards sets off from a Standard style featuring a careful balance between Strategy, Psychology and Luck. But you may just as well alter this balance with The Winner's Options, to suit the winner of the previous hand. Thus, the most &quot;psychological&quot; players will prefer a more uncertain style, and the lovers of sheer strategy will demand a more analytical style. The possibility of modulating the game allows players with different profiles to enjoy, and feel the game as just right for them.<br/><br/>Philosophy<br/>All the game is a carefully made metaphor on how we manage our emotions, and other people's, in everyday life. As you try to master the strategy, you'll learn that in order to win in the long run (the game), it is always necessary to consider the effects of a particular battle (stake/trick), even if it means losing it.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of the game is to make us reflect on the fact that in real life there's no such thing as obviously good or bad situations, but more or less complex positions in which the thin line between success and failure relies on our managing little things. It is possible to win, even if we get a bad hand.<br/><br/>"}, "10625": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic176139.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Bo Forsman"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1977", "maxplayers": "3", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Alga"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic176139_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Medieval", "Wargame"], "description": "This is a Swedish historical wargame based on Kingmaker.

This is basically a traditional Ugo - Igo system. On the Saipan map, each hex is 1.8 miles across and a Game Turn equals one day of actual time.<br/><br/>The Island Battle of Tarawa is a tactical-level game covering the invasion of Betio Island, part of the Tarawa atoll. This is a two map introductory level game using a game system called STS (Simple Tactical System) that Fresno Gaming Association claimed as their own. The STS is a pseudo-simultaneous-movement system. First one player moves a stack, or performs combat with a stack, and then his opponent does the same. The first player then repeats this with another stack, etc. The Game Turn continues according to the Sequence of Play until chance ends the Turn. That is determined by combat die rolls.

For the moment, German tactics provided the margin of victory over better material, but the Russians were proving to be quick learners.

Its array of ordnance factories includes the massive Kirov Tank Works that turns out most of the heavy KV-1 and KV-2 production for the Soviet Army. Loss of Leningrad would deprive the Soviets of a major population and industrial center and give the Germans the advantage of position in any drive against Moscow from the northwest. <br/>Army Group North, short of Luftwaffe support and motorized forces, is the only army group that fails to achieve a significant encirclement at any stage of its campaign. Skillfully utilizing terrain and ruthlessly exploiting the civilian population, the Soviets construct a fortified line along the Luga River that stalls the Germans for a month until massive Luftwaffe and motorized reinforcements from Army Group Center allow a decisive breakthrough and dash for Leningrad itself. In a furious September battle, the Germans fall just short of taking Leningrad when time runs out. Operation Typhoon, the final push against Moscow, is imminent. Army Group North must give up almost all of its Luftwaffe and motorized formations. With no strike force remaining, the Germans dig in.

In this respect, it's sort of a game of Hot Potato. Whoever can't get rid of the Hex token by using his cards &quot;blows up,&quot; thus losing points. Naturally, there are nuances to this. There are 17 different cards in the deck, some which merely pass the Hex token left, right, and across, while others split the token in two, or increase it's damage. One dismisses it entirely. One blows it up while in another player's possession. One forces the token to pass in only one direction, some cause extra effects if the token DOES blow up on you. A round ends when there are no more Hex tokens available, and there are as many rounds as there are players, plus one.<br/><br/>There are some interesting strategies that are not immediately apparent, but which become obvious after the first couple of rounds. Controlling when the last token blows up is very important since you lose and gain points based on this, so learning to play the cards to force the location of the tokens when they blow up is of paramount importance. Sending them to a player who has no cards to play works very well for this.<br/><br/>Scores are kept with individual cards monitoring &quot;Voice&quot;, which is just points. How many you have at the end of the x+1 rounds determines who the winner is.<br/><br/>One last amusing thing about the game is a bit of chaos tossed in; a Hex Hex card; when it's played, all players have to drop their card hands and put their hands in the air. The slowpoke loses points.

Play is simultaneous, with no turns.  Your goal is to have all four cards in your hand of the same value (i.e. all 4 kings, or all 4 deuces).  If a card you want is on the table, pick it up, put it in your hand, and then discard a card to replace it.  If the action comes to a standstill because noone wants any of the cards on the table, the Dealer removes them, deals another four cards, and says &quot;Begin&quot; again.<br/><br/>When you have acquired a complete set, you have Canes, but you cannot declare this yourself.  Instead, you must use a pre-arranged signal to inform your partner (which must be &quot;over the table&quot; -- no kicking your partner in the shins!), who then announces &quot;Canes&quot;.  You show your hand, and your team gets a point.  If you or your partner misread the signal and call Canes erroneously, the other team gets a point.  If you think you have spotted the other team's signal, you can call &quot;Canes against&quot;, and name the player you think has Canes.  If you are correct, your team gets a point, otherwise the other team does.

Each lot is also marked with a Roman numeral from I-V.  Players have sets of cards with the same numbers - on each round every player selects a card to be auctioned, but these are all shuffled together so no one knows exactly what will be available.

However, a player can double or triple the value of his or her lots in a section by owning a majority or all of them, which is of course easier to do in a small section.  When a section is full the lot values are put into accounts for each player - these accounts earn interest every round, and the players are allowed to add a certain amount of cash to them as well.

Fighting Mojo Jojo consists of rolling one die for each girl in the fight.  Each die has 3 sides with no stars, 2 with one star and 1 side with two stars. For each star rolled, Mojo Jojo loses one hit point.<br/><br/>The Mojo Jojo player draws a card from the Mojo Jojo deck and follows the instructions.  Mojo Jojo may attack if adjacent to a Powerpuff Girl, rolling a black die that is the counterpart to the girls' dice, except with splats instead of stars.  Then Mojo Jojo gets a second attack. The player throws a red die through the laser sight on the 3D Laser Tower to physically knock down one or more of the Powerpuff Girl figures. Each girl knocked down loses a hit point.<br/><br/>A Powerpuff Girl whose hit points are reduced to KABLOOEY! is out of the game and her figure and deck are removed.  Mojo Jojo wins if all three Powerpuff Girls are removed from the game.

Play uses a standard deck of 52 cards.  Players partner with the player across from them and are each dealt 9 cards.<br/><br/>The bid begins to the dealer's left at a minimum of four points and goes around the table, with players increasing the bid based on what they think they can take; if everyone passes the bid, the dealer is required to take the bid at four.  The player who announces the highest bid takes the position of dealer/leader and calls the trump suit, which is the only suit of import in this game (excepting the jokers and the left bauer or off-jack [jack of the same color, but not the trump suit]).  All players, save the dealer, discard all the cards from their hands that are not of the trump suit and request enough cards from the remaining 18-card deck to bring their hand up to 6. (*Note: If a player mistakenly discards a trump card, or one of the three other special cards, it is a free-for-all to whomever notices and picks it up off the table first)  The remaining cards in the deck are given to the bid-winner/leader, who can pick through them one-by-one, and pass any remaining unseen cards to his partner, each of them discarding to 6 before play begins.<br/><br/>Play begins with the dealer/leader leading in the trump suit.  Play proceeds around the table, with the player playing the highest valued card taking the trick and leading the following trick.  Players may only play cards that are of the trump suit, other remaining cards are useless. If a player takes a trick and no longer has cards of the trump suit, that players is out, and the player to the left then begins the trick.  Cards are ranked from Ace to Two, with the Off-Jack, High Joker, and Low Joker respectively taking the positions between the Jack and Ten.<br/><br/>Points are accrued by teams for taking the point cards in the tricks they take, which for 10-point pitch are Ace, Jack, Off-Jack (Left Bauer), High Joker, Low Joker (one has to rank higher than the other for play continuity), Ten, Three, and Two.  All are worth a point apiece, except the three, which is worth three.  The two is retained by the player who played it for his or her team and is not taken along with the trick.<br/><br/>Both teams receive points for the point cards they take, unless the high-bidding team does not meet their bid goal, in which case they go &quot;set&quot; and lose their number of bid points instead of gaining.  Teams play to 52 points.<br/><br/>Another option to bidding played in some areas is to &quot;shoot the moon.&quot; Shooting the moon means taking all 10 points. If the bid is shoot the moon the bidding team advances their score to 52 if their score was above zero or to zero if their score was below zero. Failure to score all ten points constitutes loss of game.<br/><br/><br/>Another version, playing for High, Low, Jack, and Game plays with hands of 6 cards.<br/><br/>There are four possible points in a hand:<br/><br/>High: highest trump card in play <br/>Low: lowest trump card in play <br/>Jack: Jack of trump, if in play<br/>Game: highest point total in tricks captured counting A - 4, K - 3, Q - 2, J - 1, and 10 - 10.<br/><br/>Starting at the dealer's left, each player has a chance to bid, with a minimum bid of 2. Players can overbid a previous bid. The person who wins the bid gets to name trump. Dealer has to take the bid if everyone passes, so if you have a decent hand when your partner dealt, it's a good idea to put in a 2 bid if the first person didn't bid. Not only will your partner not get stuck, but the third person to bid won't get to take an easy 2 bid if they want it, and will have to go 3.<br/><br/>If you bid and don't make it, you go up that many points. You can make points if your opponents bid.<br/><br/>After the bid and declaration of trump, some people allow trashing and getting up to 2 new cards.<br/><br/>The player who won the bid leads a trump card. After that, the person who won the previous trick leads. Players must follow the suit led if possible, or play any suit if not, and may trump in at any time. Highest card of the suit lead takes the trick, if no trump is played. If trump is played, highest trump takes it.<br/><br/>First team to 21 points wins.<br/><br/>&quot;Jersey Pitch&quot; adds the rule that the 5 of trump is worth 5 points.<br/><br/>"}, "10790": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic44198.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1984", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamepublisher": ["Irwin Toy Ltd.", "Lakeside"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic44198_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Dice"], "description": "The object of Super Aggravation is to move your four markers from your Base to Home.

With its large square box and its flat black box, Ooyoo could have been one of these strange games that we used to look with eagerness and curiosity in the Impens&eacute; Radical bookshop, in Paris, in the late seventies and early eighties. Yes, I know I'm getting old. Nothing oriental though in this game, since the exotism is fake, and author and publisher both German.<br/><br/>Ooyoo, however, is what it looks like : a simple and subtle strategy game, with three lines of rules, that could well become a classic. Like in Halma or Chinese Checkers, each player starts in a corner of the board and tries to bring all his stones in the opposite corner. The trick is in the simple and original movement rule : stones can only move by pair, two adjacent stones moving one space in the same direction. This makes for various blocking and turning strategies, especially since each player has an uneven number of stones, and can't move backwards in his own half of the board.<br/><br/>Ooyoo is much more subtle than Chinese Checkers, but doesn't pretend to be as deep and as Go - the similarity is mostly in the overall look. This excellent strategy game deserves to become a modern classic, along with Twixt, Focus or Lines of Action, and can also make for a nice and slightly lighter change for Go or Chess players. Furthermore, it really looks like an exotic traditional game that you brought back from holidays, and will make a strong impression in your lounge.<br/><br/>"}, "10797": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Ty Bomba", "Robert G.

Robert E. Lee was perplexed. He'd smashed the Army of the Potomac at Gettysburg, then chewed up its remnants as it tried to defend Washington, captured that city, though much of it was burned in the process, and came within card throw of bagging both Lincoln &amp; Grant. But instead of gaining the Confederacy the ultimate victory Lee had sought when he began that risky campaign, the fall of Washington served only to radicalize &amp; galvanize the North.<br/><br/>Lincoln has sailed to Boston to set up a new US capital. He declined the 'offer of mediation toward peace' extended by the ambassadors of Great Britain &amp; France. London &amp; Paris soon recognized the Confederacy - the government of which now housed in the charred &amp; bullet-pocked city of Washington, DD (that is, the District of Dixie!), and announced they would join the war to secure its independence.<br/><br/>But then, before Union &amp; Anglo-French naval vessels even exchanged their first broadsides, the Prussians made their move, declaring for the Union &amp; launching strong attacks into France &amp; Bavaria. That led the Austrians; ever jealous and fearful their Prussian cousins were aiming to supplant their primacy in the Germanic world, to throw in with France. Then the Czar mobilized his millions of newly emancipated serfs, creating the largest single army yet seen on the planet, leading them in an attack on Vienna.<br/><br/>With the CSA, Britain, France &amp; Austria on one side, fighting the USA, Prussia &amp; Russia on the other, World War I began in August 1863. &quot;Home Before the Leaves Fall&quot; was the cry heard across the northern hemisphere.<br/><br/>Lee convinced Jefferson Davis to reinforce him by shifting troops fromBragg;'s Army to create a 4th Corps for the Army of Northern Virginia. Comprised of Tennessee men &amp; recruits from the new Confederate state of Maryland, Gen. Pat Cleburne was picked to run it. Lee intended to use the new Corps as a screen for his next offensive.<br/><br/>With the fall of Vicksburg, &amp; Port Hudson, Lee reasoned Gen.Sherman would move east to relieve the Union's fortunes. If he could intercept Sherman &amp; destroy his army before it linked with Grant's, the war would surely end. Scanning his maps, Lee determined Pittsburgh was the key. If he controlled it, he would sever the only east / west rail line left to the Union. It was also the perfect place to meet the British (actually Anglo-Canadian) Expeditionary Force forming in Canada for a crossing of Lake Erie.<br/><br/>Lee sent an outline of his plan to the Commander of the BEF, Sir Patrick Macdougall, who was highly receptive, sending a reply in which he promised to rendezvous with lee at Pittsburgh on or around October 1.<br/><br/>Until 14 September, Grant &amp; Lincoln had assumed Lee's next move would be in the Northeast. On that day a minister of the Canadian government, a strong abolition man, defected with a copy of the Confederate general's letter. After much debate, the two US war leaders convinced themselves the document was authentic &amp; set about to counter Lee's plan. The 3rd Corps was left to defend the Susquehanna River line, in case they were wrong, and a telegram was sent to Sherman instructing him to move to Pittsburgh as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>By the 17th, when Lee began marching northeast towards Pittsburgh, Grant had already stolen a day's march on him. The question became who would get to the city first to meet Lee &amp; Grant: the BEF, shuttling across Lake Erie then marching down the western borderlands of Pennsylvania, or Sherman, coming up the Ohio valley. Neither Grant nor Lee knew who would be reinforced first or exactly when, but both understood there would be a savage fight for Pittsburgh. It would go into southern history books as the Battle of Six Bridges.<br/><br/>As noted, it is an alternative history of American Civil War, prequel of this is Wahoo! -- The Battle of Washington, July 8, 1863.<br/><br/>"}, "10799": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic253001.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Minions", "Richie Rich'$ Rich Man-Poor Man Card Game"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamecompilation": ["Animal Safari 3 in 1", "Kidz Cardz 4 Favorite Card Games"], "yearpublished": "1874", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Hans-Joachim Behrendt", "Beatrice Braun-Fock", "Dick Bruna", "Wilhelm Busch", "Jim Davis", "Wolfgang de Ha\u00e8n", "Constanza Droop", "Anne Erler-Reichold", "Manfred Fischer", "Klemens Franz", "Oliver Freudenreich", "Thomas Goletz", "Alex Graham", "Werner Graichen", "Vernon Grant", "Roger Hargreaves", "Racey Helps", "Lisbeth Honigsmann", "Janosch", "Rolf Kauka", "Walter Lantz", "Dagmar Launhardt", "Liesel La\u00fcterborn", "Ludek Man\u00e1sek", "Willy Mayrl", "Hans Meier-Freiberg", "Eva-Maria Ott-Heidmann", "Harri Parschau", "Otto Pech", "Friedrich Petersen", "Carl Olof Peters\u00e9n", "Valeria Petrone", "Peyo", "Benjamin Rabier", "Hans R\u00e4de", "Heinz Rodewald", "Annet Rudolph", "Ingeborg Scherer", "Jens Schumacher", "Stefan Senninger", "Ernst Stapelfeld", "Senta Stein", "Eric Sturtevant", "Markus Wagner", "Anja Wrede", "Herbert Zeise"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)", "(Web published)", "Adolf Johnsons f\u00f6rlag", "Algazarra", "AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH", "Andrews & Blaine", "Antwerpsche Hypotheekkas", "Arrco Playing Card Co.", "Arrow Games Ltd", "ASS Altenburger Spielkarten", "Bazoo Global", "Berliner Spielkarten", "Bielefelder Spielkarten", "Birkel Teigwaren GmbH", "Bizerba", "Brandst\u00e4tter Group", "Built-Rite", "Cardinal", "Carlit", "Cartamundi", "Cathay Pacific", "CES", "Chad Valley Co Ltd.", "Cheatwell Games", "Chiefton Products Ltd.", "Clifford Toys", "Clown Games", "Comas", "Copag - Cia.

You can buy a deck of cards designed for the game, but it can be easily played with a standard deck of cards:<br/><br/>Throw away all but one of the queens from the deck. You won't use the &quot;extra queens&quot; during play. (You may also want to throw out all black cards or all red cards to speed up the game). Deal all the cards out to the players. Players put down any pairs they have, then keep the rest of their cards in their hand, hidden from their opponents. From here on, take turns; on your turn, draw a card from any other player. If you made a pair, then put it down.<br/><br/>In the end, all cards except the &quot;old maid&quot; (the one queen left in the deck) will be down in pairs. Whoever holds that card loses! Everybody else wins!<br/><br/>The best part of this game is seeing another player draw the old maid away from you. You're supposed to keep it a secret when this happens (because other players will avoid drawing from the victim if they know that they risk the old maid by doing so), but young children usually laugh or gloat when the old maid gets taken from them. Adults playing can make the victim feel better by trying to draw the maid away from them.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["All-Fair Edition", "All-Fair Nursery Rhyme Edition",

In a Casino, usually six (6) or eight (8) decks of cards are shuffled together and placed in a card shoe for distribution.  The player must wager before any cards are dealt. He does this by placing his bet in front of his table position. Next, the dealer deals two cards to each of the players and two to himself. (One of the dealer's cards is dealt face up, one is dealt face down). Face cards count as ten, ace counts as one or 11, and all other cards are counted at their face value.<br/><br/>A blackjack occurs if the player's first two cards are an ace and a ten or face card. This is usually a winning hand, although if the dealer also has a blackjack, it is a tie. A winning blackjack pays the player three to two.<br/><br/>The dealer must draw on 16 and stand on 17. (A dealer total of 17 including an ace, or &quot;soft 17&quot;, must be drawn to in some games and must stand in others). Options:<br/><br/>Hit or Stand - Hit means to draw another card, which the player signifies by tapping the table with his cards or a similar hand motion. Stand means that the player wants no more cards, which the player signals by placing his cards under his wager or holding his hand in a horizontal direction. If the player hits and busts (goes over 21), his wager is lost.<br/><br/>Double down - The player is allowed to double his original bet on his first two cards, then draw one more card.<br/><br/>Splitting - If the first cards a player is dealt are a pair, they may be split into two hands which are played separately. The bet on each hand must be the same amount. Aces receive only one card. After splitting, Ace-ten counts as 21, and not as blackjack.<br/><br/>Insurance - A bet not exceeding one-half of the original bet. When the dealer's up card is an ace, the player may take insurance. If the dealer's down card is a ten or face card, the player wins two to one. Any other card means a win for the dealer.<br/><br/>Surrender - To give up after the deal of the first two cards. Only one-half of the original bet is lost. Not all blackjack games offer surrender.<br/><br/>When not playing at a casino, it is usual for the role of Dealer to rotate among the players.<br/><br/>Pontoon is a similar game, but there are some small rules variations.

One tile has the right angle paths in the same place on both sides. The other tile has them on different places on each side. This works because you can tell by the markings which paths are on the underside without having to look.

Yet, there are those veterans, men of honor and war, who have the taste of freedom and blood fresh on their tongues.

The die with the numbers 4-9 is used for the advanced game.<br/><br/>The six smaller black dice have the standard numbers 2-6, but the remaining side can be used either as a 1 or a 7, depending on the player's choice.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY:<br/>The 4-9 large die is set aside. All players play at the same time, taking turns as to who will be the 'roller'. The other eight dice (2 large and 6 small) are simultaneously rolled in full view of all the players, and must not be touched by ANY player.<br/><br/>The two Large Dice form a 2-digit number, which can either be high or low. For example, if the large dice show a 3 &amp; 6, the low number would be 36 and the high number would be 63. Players study the dice and quickly call &quot;HIGH&quot;, &quot;LOW&quot;, &quot;HIGH/LOW&quot; or &quot;ZIPPY&quot; AFTER they have found a way of totaling either of the two numbers formed by the large green dcie with the small black ones using addition, subtration, multiplication and division.<br/><br/>The first person to call and get a correct result gets 1 chip, unless they call HIGH/LOW and show both answers - then they get 2 chips. You lose the same amount of chips if you are incorrect. If you call ZIPPY (which means no possible way to reach the target values) you get a chip from the bank unless someone challenges you. Then, whomever is correct pays the other.<br/><br/>The advanced version uses the 4-9 die in place of one of the other large dice for more challenging possible results.<br/><br/>UK players will see this as a dice driven version of the numbers quiz from the TV show Countdown.<br/><br/>"}, "10904": {"boardgamedesigner": ["R.
