The struggle is tense and all manner of dirty tricks are allowed. Each faction has the capacity to apply pressure on the others and has the chance of canceling their votes. Tyrus is thus a game of careful application of power, force and influence in order to affect the best outcome possible for your political party. Throughout the game you must try to carefully conserve your troops, because you never know when they will be needed. Both parties start the game with equal forces, so Bluff and misdirection are your main weapons to win the day, and become Master of the city.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     Bo\u00eete \u00e0 jeux (turn-based)<br/>     Yucata (turn-based)<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"88372": "First edition"}, "name": "Tyrus", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2003": "Rock-Paper-Scissors"}, "average": "6.03784", "usersrated": "329", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "age": "12"}, "10521": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Star Trek: The Final Frontier", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "1992", "usersrated": "15", "boardgamefamily": {"7392": "Star Trek"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic855479_t.jpg", "average": "3.6", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2317": {"name": "Toys & Games Limited"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic855479.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"210446": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "'Space, the final frontier, this is a game involving the SS Enterprise and it's (sic.) missions to explore new worlds and seek out new civilizations!'<br/><br/>Star Trek   - The Final Frontier is a fun, action packed game for all the family' because it is not particularly difficult, but involves a lot of luck in die rolling and event cards.

The deck consists of six suits ranging from 0 to 15, a High Rooler card, a Low Rooler card, and two blank cards.<br/><br/>The game is usually played with teams. Players bid in five-point increments from 170 to 300. After everyone passes once, the winner chooses two trump suits. High Trump beats all other suits, even Low Trump. Low Trump beats all suits but High Trump. The Roolerz now take their positions as least powerful, yet most valuable cards in their respective trumps.<br/><br/>Gameplay proceeds like most other trick taking games. Ordinarily, the highest card in the lead suit wins the trick. The only exception is when trump is played. In that case, the highest trump card wins the trick.<br/><br/>The blank card may be played at any time, regardless of what suit was led or how many cards of that suit the player has.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, points are tallied. Points are only given to players who have the following cards: 15 (scores 15 points), 14 (scores 10 points), 10 (scores 10 points), 5 (scores 5 points), and the two Rooler cards (30 points each). All other cards are worth zero points.<br/><br/>A team is set if it fails to win as many points as it bid.

On your turn you watch a 10-15 second random video clip of one of the nine events. At the end of the clip is a section with rapidly changing point values. You then pause the VCR and score whatever points are shown, double them if the space on the board you are on matches the event you just watched. You will then be given the number of spaces to move your token on the board which represents a mountain with three different ski trails down it and ski lifts back up. You can begin to collect medals by accumulating 500 points in a certain event and then landing on a special space for that event to collect the next medal. The first to do this in each event gets the gold for that event, the next the silver, and so on. There are also spaces on the board that can set you back or have you draw a card. The cards can add to your score, set you back or be a lift ticket, which entitles you to move back up the board at any time. After all nine gold medals have been won the game is over and the player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>This is a great game for the whole family and the replayability of this game is very high.

The main feature of the Emotrions line is that it introduces the issue of Emotional Intelligence into a sector traditionally focused on the development of analytical intelligence.<br/><br/>EmotrionsOnCards is a really entertaining and addictive game. It's also easy to learn due to its few and consistent rules. There's a conscious balance between a distillate simplicity, which makes it possible for everybody to play in a more relaxed - &quot;light&quot; - manner, and a depth of game which will satisfy the classic strategy game hard players.<br/><br/>In EmotrionsOnCards, the cards, called emotrions, represent the basic human feelings: love, hatred, joy, sadness, fury, indecision... Some emotrions score points, others take them away. And they keep intermingling in your hand, when playing each trick, and even when you win!<br/><br/>It is very powerful as a strategy game. The miracle lays in its innovative logic, with negative and positive playing cards.<br/><br/>With only 36 cards and some minimal rules you'll be able to unfold many complex and shady situations. And you can also play different games with the same set of cards, such as The Pareo Game.<br/><br/>Strategy, psychology and luck <br/>EmotrionsOnCards sets off from a Standard style featuring a careful balance between Strategy, Psychology and Luck. But you may just as well alter this balance with The Winner's Options, to suit the winner of the previous hand. Thus, the most &quot;psychological&quot; players will prefer a more uncertain style, and the lovers of sheer strategy will demand a more analytical style. The possibility of modulating the game allows players with different profiles to enjoy, and feel the game as just right for them.<br/><br/>Philosophy<br/>All the game is a carefully made metaphor on how we manage our emotions, and other people's, in everyday life. As you try to master the strategy, you'll learn that in order to win in the long run (the game), it is always necessary to consider the effects of a particular battle (stake/trick), even if it means losing it.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of the game is to make us reflect on the fact that in real life there's no such thing as obviously good or bad situations, but more or less complex positions in which the thin line between success and failure relies on our managing little things.

This is a two map introductory level game using a game system called STS (Simple Tactical System) that Fresno Gaming Association claimed as their own. The STS is a pseudo-simultaneous-movement system. First one player moves a stack, or performs combat with a stack, and then his opponent does the same. The first player then repeats this with another stack, etc. The Game Turn continues according to the Sequence of Play until chance ends the Turn. That is determined by combat die rolls.

They had not been prepared to encounter hundreds of KV-1's and T-34's, tanks far superior to anything they possessed. For the moment, German tactics provided the margin of victory over better material, but the Russians were proving to be quick learners. Worse yet, by western European standards, Russian losses had been so staggering that there should have been no army left to fight. Not so.

In this respect, it's sort of a game of Hot Potato. Whoever can't get rid of the Hex token by using his cards &quot;blows up,&quot; thus losing points. Naturally, there are nuances to this. There are 17 different cards in the deck, some which merely pass the Hex token left, right, and across, while others split the token in two, or increase it's damage. One dismisses it entirely. One blows it up while in another player's possession. One forces the token to pass in only one direction, some cause extra effects if the token DOES blow up on you. A round ends when there are no more Hex tokens available, and there are as many rounds as there are players, plus one.<br/><br/>There are some interesting strategies that are not immediately apparent, but which become obvious after the first couple of rounds. Controlling when the last token blows up is very important since you lose and gain points based on this, so learning to play the cards to force the location of the tokens when they blow up is of paramount importance. Sending them to a player who has no cards to play works very well for this.<br/><br/>Scores are kept with individual cards monitoring &quot;Voice&quot;, which is just points. How many you have at the end of the x+1 rounds determines who the winner is.<br/><br/>One last amusing thing about the game is a bit of chaos tossed in; a Hex Hex card; when it's played, all players have to drop their card hands and put their hands in the air.

Play uses a standard deck of 52 cards.  Players partner with the player across from them and are each dealt 9 cards.<br/><br/>The bid begins to the dealer's left at a minimum of four points and goes around the table, with players increasing the bid based on what they think they can take; if everyone passes the bid, the dealer is required to take the bid at four.  The player who announces the highest bid takes the position of dealer/leader and calls the trump suit, which is the only suit of import in this game (excepting the jokers and the left bauer or off-jack [jack of the same color, but not the trump suit]).  All players, save the dealer, discard all the cards from their hands that are not of the trump suit and request enough cards from the remaining 18-card deck to bring their hand up to 6. (*Note: If a player mistakenly discards a trump card, or one of the three other special cards, it is a free-for-all to whomever notices and picks it up off the table first)  The remaining cards in the deck are given to the bid-winner/leader, who can pick through them one-by-one, and pass any remaining unseen cards to his partner, each of them discarding to 6 before play begins.<br/><br/>Play begins with the dealer/leader leading in the trump suit.  Play proceeds around the table, with the player playing the highest valued card taking the trick and leading the following trick.  Players may only play cards that are of the trump suit, other remaining cards are useless. If a player takes a trick and no longer has cards of the trump suit, that players is out, and the player to the left then begins the trick.  Cards are ranked from Ace to Two, with the Off-Jack, High Joker, and Low Joker respectively taking the positions between the Jack and Ten.<br/><br/>Points are accrued by teams for taking the point cards in the tricks they take, which for 10-point pitch are Ace, Jack, Off-Jack (Left Bauer), High Joker, Low Joker (one has to rank higher than the other for play continuity), Ten, Three, and Two.  All are worth a point apiece, except the three, which is worth three.  The two is retained by the player who played it for his or her team and is not taken along with the trick.<br/><br/>Both teams receive points for the point cards they take, unless the high-bidding team does not meet their bid goal, in which case they go &quot;set&quot; and lose their number of bid points instead of gaining.  Teams play to 52 points.<br/><br/>Another option to bidding played in some areas is to &quot;shoot the moon.&quot; Shooting the moon means taking all 10 points. If the bid is shoot the moon the bidding team advances their score to 52 if their score was above zero or to zero if their score was below zero. Failure to score all ten points constitutes loss of game.<br/><br/><br/>Another version, playing for High, Low, Jack, and Game plays with hands of 6 cards.<br/><br/>There are four possible points in a hand:<br/><br/>High: highest trump card in play <br/>Low: lowest trump card in play <br/>Jack: Jack of trump, if in play<br/>Game: highest point total in tricks captured counting A - 4, K - 3, Q - 2, J - 1, and 10 - 10.<br/><br/>Starting at the dealer's left, each player has a chance to bid, with a minimum bid of 2. Players can overbid a previous bid. The person who wins the bid gets to name trump. Dealer has to take the bid if everyone passes, so if you have a decent hand when your partner dealt, it's a good idea to put in a 2 bid if the first person didn't bid. Not only will your partner not get stuck, but the third person to bid won't get to take an easy 2 bid if they want it, and will have to go 3.<br/><br/>If you bid and don't make it, you go up that many points. You can make points if your opponents bid.<br/><br/>After the bid and declaration of trump, some people allow trashing and getting up to 2 new cards.<br/><br/>The player who won the bid leads a trump card. After that, the person who won the previous trick leads. Players must follow the suit led if possible, or play any suit if not, and may trump in at any time. Highest card of the suit lead takes the trick, if no trump is played. If trump is played, highest trump takes it.<br/><br/>First team to 21 points wins.<br/><br/>&quot;Jersey Pitch&quot; adds the rule that the 5 of trump is worth 5 points.<br/><br/>"}, "10790": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic44198.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"39520": {"name": "\u00c4rger Dich schwarz!"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1984", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamepublisher": {"520": {"name": "Irwin Toy Ltd."}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic44198_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "description": "The object of Super Aggravation is to move your four markers from your Base to Home.

With its large square box and its flat black box, Ooyoo could have been one of these strange games that we used to look with eagerness and curiosity in the Impens&eacute; Radical bookshop, in Paris, in the late seventies and early eighties. Yes, I know I'm getting old. Nothing oriental though in this game, since the exotism is fake, and author and publisher both German.<br/><br/>Ooyoo, however, is what it looks like : a simple and subtle strategy game, with three lines of rules, that could well become a classic. Like in Halma or Chinese Checkers, each player starts in a corner of the board and tries to bring all his stones in the opposite corner. The trick is in the simple and original movement rule : stones can only move by pair, two adjacent stones moving one space in the same direction. This makes for various blocking and turning strategies, especially since each player has an uneven number of stones, and can't move backwards in his own half of the board.<br/><br/>Ooyoo is much more subtle than Chinese Checkers, but doesn't pretend to be as deep and as Go - the similarity is mostly in the overall look. This excellent strategy game deserves to become a modern classic, along with Twixt, Focus or Lines of Action, and can also make for a nice and slightly lighter change for Go or Chess players. Furthermore, it really looks like an exotic traditional game that you brought back from holidays, and will make a strong impression in your lounge.<br/><br/>"}, "10797": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1747": {"name": "Ty Bomba"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Hoorah!", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "yearpublished": "1996", "usersrated": "21", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic196867_t.jpg", "average": "6.22", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"189": {"name": "XTR Corp"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic196867.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"34528": "Command Magazine edition"}, "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": {"1048": {"name": "American Civil War"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "Subtitle: Six Bridges: The Battle of Pittsburgh, October 1, 1863<br/><br/>It was early September 1863 &amp; Gen. Robert E. Lee was perplexed. He'd smashed the Army of the Potomac at Gettysburg, then chewed up its remnants as it tried to defend Washington, captured that city, though much of it was burned in the process, and came within card throw of bagging both Lincoln &amp; Grant. But instead of gaining the Confederacy the ultimate victory Lee had sought when he began that risky campaign, the fall of Washington served only to radicalize &amp; galvanize the North.<br/><br/>Lincoln has sailed to Boston to set up a new US capital. He declined the 'offer of mediation toward peace' extended by the ambassadors of Great Britain &amp; France. London &amp; Paris soon recognized the Confederacy - the government of which now housed in the charred &amp; bullet-pocked city of Washington, DD (that is, the District of Dixie!), and announced they would join the war to secure its independence.<br/><br/>But then, before Union &amp; Anglo-French naval vessels even exchanged their first broadsides, the Prussians made their move, declaring for the Union &amp; launching strong attacks into France &amp; Bavaria. That led the Austrians; ever jealous and fearful their Prussian cousins were aiming to supplant their primacy in the Germanic world, to throw in with France. Then the Czar mobilized his millions of newly emancipated serfs, creating the largest single army yet seen on the planet, leading them in an attack on Vienna.<br/><br/>With the CSA, Britain, France &amp; Austria on one side, fighting the USA, Prussia &amp; Russia on the other, World War I began in August 1863. &quot;Home Before the Leaves Fall&quot; was the cry heard across the northern hemisphere.<br/><br/>Lee convinced Jefferson Davis to reinforce him by shifting troops fromBragg;'s Army to create a 4th Corps for the Army of Northern Virginia. Comprised of Tennessee men &amp; recruits from the new Confederate state of Maryland, Gen. Pat Cleburne was picked to run it. Lee intended to use the new Corps as a screen for his next offensive.<br/><br/>With the fall of Vicksburg, &amp; Port Hudson, Lee reasoned Gen.Sherman would move east to relieve the Union's fortunes. If he could intercept Sherman &amp; destroy his army before it linked with Grant's, the war would surely end. Scanning his maps, Lee determined Pittsburgh was the key. If he controlled it, he would sever the only east / west rail line left to the Union. It was also the perfect place to meet the British (actually Anglo-Canadian) Expeditionary Force forming in Canada for a crossing of Lake Erie.<br/><br/>Lee sent an outline of his plan to the Commander of the BEF, Sir Patrick Macdougall, who was highly receptive, sending a reply in which he promised to rendezvous with lee at Pittsburgh on or around October 1.<br/><br/>Until 14 September, Grant &amp; Lincoln had assumed Lee's next move would be in the Northeast. On that day a minister of the Canadian government, a strong abolition man, defected with a copy of the Confederate general's letter. After much debate, the two US war leaders convinced themselves the document was authentic &amp; set about to counter Lee's plan. The 3rd Corps was left to defend the Susquehanna River line, in case they were wrong, and a telegram was sent to Sherman instructing him to move to Pittsburgh as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>By the 17th, when Lee began marching northeast towards Pittsburgh, Grant had already stolen a day's march on him. The question became who would get to the city first to meet Lee &amp; Grant: the BEF, shuttling across Lake Erie then marching down the western borderlands of Pennsylvania, or Sherman, coming up the Ohio valley. Neither Grant nor Lee knew who would be reinforced first or exactly when, but both understood there would be a savage fight for Pittsburgh. It would go into southern history books as the Battle of Six Bridges.<br/><br/>As noted, it is an alternative history of American Civil War, prequel of this is Wahoo! -- The Battle of Washington, July 8, 1863.<br/><br/>"}, "10799": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic253001.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"190600": "Minions"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamecompilation": {"224452": "Animal Safari 3 in 1"}, "yearpublished": "1874", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"63422": "Hans-Joachim Behrendt"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3320": {"name": "(Unknown)"}}, "maxplaytime": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic253001_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "5", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "description": "Old Maid is a traditional children's game.

In a Casino, usually six (6) or eight (8) decks of cards are shuffled together and placed in a card shoe for distribution.  The player must wager before any cards are dealt. He does this by placing his bet in front of his table position. Next, the dealer deals two cards to each of the players and two to himself. (One of the dealer's cards is dealt face up, one is dealt face down). Face cards count as ten, ace counts as one or 11, and all other cards are counted at their face value.<br/><br/>A blackjack occurs if the player's first two cards are an ace and a ten or face card. This is usually a winning hand, although if the dealer also has a blackjack, it is a tie. A winning blackjack pays the player three to two.<br/><br/>The dealer must draw on 16 and stand on 17. (A dealer total of 17 including an ace, or &quot;soft 17&quot;, must be drawn to in some games and must stand in others). Options:<br/><br/>Hit or Stand - Hit means to draw another card, which the player signifies by tapping the table with his cards or a similar hand motion. Stand means that the player wants no more cards, which the player signals by placing his cards under his wager or holding his hand in a horizontal direction. If the player hits and busts (goes over 21), his wager is lost.<br/><br/>Double down - The player is allowed to double his original bet on his first two cards, then draw one more card.<br/><br/>Splitting - If the first cards a player is dealt are a pair, they may be split into two hands which are played separately. The bet on each hand must be the same amount. Aces receive only one card. After splitting, Ace-ten counts as 21, and not as blackjack.<br/><br/>Insurance - A bet not exceeding one-half of the original bet. When the dealer's up card is an ace, the player may take insurance. If the dealer's down card is a ten or face card, the player wins two to one. Any other card means a win for the dealer.<br/><br/>Surrender - To give up after the deal of the first two cards. Only one-half of the original bet is lost. Not all blackjack games offer surrender.<br/><br/>When not playing at a casino, it is usual for the role of Dealer to rotate among the players.<br/><br/>Pontoon is a similar game, but there are some small rules variations. For example, the dealer wins on ties and both of their cards are dealt face down.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"184805": "Public Domain edition"}, "name": "Blackjack", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "average": "4.57573", "usersrated": "1152", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"98": "Traditional Card Games"}}, "10817": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic44794.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3514": {"name": "D.

Players must get 4 of their 5 pieces across the board and can rotate a tile 90 degrees each turn. The trick in the game is that you can move on the paths over the tiles, then move on the paths underneath the tiles, then move again on the surface.<br/><br/>There are two kinds of tile. One tile has the right angle paths in the same place on both sides. The other tile has them on different places on each side. This works because you can tell by the markings which paths are on the underside without having to look. The board is set up randomly in a 5x7 grid.<br/><br/>When travelling underneath, you must travelling under at least one stone on the surface, of either player. If you do go under an opponent's stone, you are allowed a further tile rotation at the end of your move (a key bonus that gives you an edge). You are not allowed to move a tile that your opponent just turned, but otherwise you can rotate any tile at all.<br/><br/>The new edition by Abacus is in card, with little wood posts to help lift and turn the tiles. The first edition is a nice wooden edition, part of a range of games by the firm Clemens Gerhards.<br/><br/>Moguli seems like a brain-burner at first, but quickly the possibilities become obvious, and as only a few tiles move, you can read the paths on both sides very easily. You move from trying to figure the board, to trying to figure your opponent's options and how to exploit them.

Instead, players try to predict the entire order of finish for all the cars in the race. All players can influence the speed of a car through their card play. Cards are played in tricks that are used to determine what car can move that round, how far it will move, who will drive the car, and finally what player will lead to the next trick. The track itself is far from any ordinary race track with various short cuts and back tracks scattered throughout the circuit allowing for drivers of the cars to have quite a bit of control over their progress. In the end, the player that most closely predicted the finishing order of each car will emerge victoriously.<br/><br/><br/>A note about how to &quot;short cut&quot; a homemade version:<br/>Use the cars from Knizia's Formula Motor Racing game and the cards from Sticheln. Using the cards from Sticheln is a real time and work saver!

The infighting among the city's major factions has only increased since war's end and the city itself faces utter destruction as the dangers of the surrounding wilderness grow. Without leadership the city will soon fall. There must be one who can unite the city under their leadership and restore order. You must be this one.<br/><br/>Welcome to Allegiance: War of Factions, a collectible card game where each player takes the role of a lord or lady vying for control of a mighty city. Extend your influence in an attempt to control the city's major political, religious, and economic powers. While fighting for control, it may even be necessary to join forces with those who you would call your enemies as the city itself stands on the brink of being overrun by the denizens of the wild.<br/><br/>So then, to which Factions will you make your call for support? House Mosfin? Is the strength of Droman Tregorian and his house sufficient to stand with on your way to dominance? Or would your ties to the Goddess Kalim better serve your efforts? Surely those who support the Glory of Kalim would recognize your true strength and the divine calling which Kalim, herself, has given you. Yet, there are those veterans, men of honor and war, who have the taste of freedom and blood fresh on their tongues. Perhaps your call to them to follow you yet again into battle would give you the strength needed to claim control over the city. The decision is yours - but choose wisely who you would call friend, for in this trying time it is unsure where their allegiances lie.<br/><br/>Allegiance: War of Factions introduces a unique system of play which allows everyone to become more involved in every phase of the game. Why sit back waiting for your enemies to make their move when you can stop them before they even get the chance? Form alliances, threaten your enemies, back-stab your friends, hoard the city's resources - the choice is yours!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"86791": "English first edition"}, "name": "Allegiance: War of Factions", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "average": "6.92059", "usersrated": "34", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4667": "Customizable Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"6040": "CCGs (Collectible Card Games)"}}, "10894": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Eichh\u00f6rnchenbande", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "yearpublished": "2001", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": {"7668": "Animals: Squirrels"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic44690_t.jpg", "average": "5.8", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"38": {"name": "Schmidt Spiele"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic44690.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"134041": "Schmidt Spiele Edition 2001"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "&quot;Squirrel Gang&quot; is a bluffing game for children - if you will, Liar's Dice for kids.

The die with the numbers 4-9 is used for the advanced game.<br/><br/>The six smaller black dice have the standard numbers 2-6, but the remaining side can be used either as a 1 or a 7, depending on the player's choice.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY:<br/>The 4-9 large die is set aside. All players play at the same time, taking turns as to who will be the 'roller'. The other eight dice (2 large and 6 small) are simultaneously rolled in full view of all the players, and must not be touched by ANY player.<br/><br/>The two Large Dice form a 2-digit number, which can either be high or low. For example, if the large dice show a 3 &amp; 6, the low number would be 36 and the high number would be 63. Players study the dice and quickly call &quot;HIGH&quot;, &quot;LOW&quot;, &quot;HIGH/LOW&quot; or &quot;ZIPPY&quot; AFTER they have found a way of totaling either of the two numbers formed by the large green dcie with the small black ones using addition, subtration, multiplication and division.<br/><br/>The first person to call and get a correct result gets 1 chip, unless they call HIGH/LOW and show both answers - then they get 2 chips. You lose the same amount of chips if you are incorrect. If you call ZIPPY (which means no possible way to reach the target values) you get a chip from the bank unless someone challenges you. Then, whomever is correct pays the other.<br/><br/>The advanced version uses the 4-9 die in place of one of the other large dice for more challenging possible results.<br/><br/>UK players will see this as a dice driven version of the numbers quiz from the TV show Countdown.<br/><br/>"}, "10904": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3548": {"name": "R.

A host of options allow players to see how Shiloh might have been fought if Grant hadn't been surprised, or if the South had received additional men from Van Dorn's Army of the West<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 30 minutes<br/>Hex: 200 yards<br/>Units: Brigades<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 32-page CWBS 2nd Edition system rulebook<br/>One 24-page April's Harvest specific rulebook<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 1 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-20 hours<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"41030": "The Gamers First edition"}, "average": "7.12278", "name": "April's Harvest: The Battle of Shiloh, April 6 & 7, 1862", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "126", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"119": "Civil War, Brigade (CWB) Series"}}, "10965": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Word Spin", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "1996", "usersrated": "16", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic45468_t.jpg", "average": "3.59375", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2064": {"name": "Geospace Products Co., Inc."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic45468.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"145504": "French Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1025": {"name": "Word Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "8 ten-sided discs have letters on each face; the consonants have points values.
