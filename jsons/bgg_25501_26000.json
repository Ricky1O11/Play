Percentage dice (2 x D10's) are used to determine if a percentage fraction &quot;hits&quot; or not.<br/><br/>Although the rules use a casualty removal system, the most a side can lose is 3 figures per missile or melee round. Morale has a strong influence in the game, and the side that can force more morale tests upon his opponent will often win the game.<br/><br/>The rules come with  a sheet of order chits/status markers, which can either be cut out or photocopied (using different colored paper can help to further distinguish the orders or unit status at a glance). This is not as complex a set of miniature rules as compared to Warrior, but it can get a bit involved for new players.<br/><br/>"}, "25523": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1763": {"name": "Peter Eggert"}}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Hol's der P\u00f6ppel", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "3", "yearpublished": "1998", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic161071_t.jpg", "average": "5.5", "boardgamepublisher": {"1015": {"name": "eggertspiele"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic161071.jpg", "maxplaytime": "60", "poll": {}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Description (loosly translated) from the eggertspiele-Website:<br/><br/>Lead your ancient people to victory!<br/><br/>A game where you can help your luck through good tactics.<br/><br/>The aim is to collect counters on the unusual game board.

Your deck represents your Juggernaut.  Your opponent also has a Juggernaut. Your goal is to incapacitate your opponent&rsquo;s Juggernaut so your ground forces can infiltrate and overwhelm it before he or she can do the same to you.<br/><br/>Before the game starts, you need to download and print out Juggernauts cards and build your deck.  Cards fall into general categories of power generators, attacks, defenses, and miscellaneous effects.<br/><br/>At the start of a game:<br/><br/>     Pick a standard polyhedral die to be your Juggernaut's Commander.<br/>     Draw cards equal to the number of sides on your Commander, plus three.<br/>     Lay out all but three of the cards in your hand face-down so that each card:<br/>         occupies one square in an imaginary grid, and<br/>         is adjacent to at least one card.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This matrix of cards is your Juggernaut.  Face-down cards are inactive nodes and face-up cards are active nodes.<br/><br/>Play during a game is simultaneous; you and your opponent go through the same phases in a turn at the same time.  You  start your turn by gaining 1 power (plus any additional from active cards in your Juggernaut).  You use power to:<br/><br/>     Activate cards that require Power,<br/>     Increase the effectiveness of an attack or defense,<br/>     Maintain cards you want to keep<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>After you gain power, you roll your Commander to see which card in your Juggernaut's matrix activates.  If you do not have an active card by the end of your command phase (this can happen if your Commander tries to activate a damaged sector, a neutralized card, or a card token), put an alert token on your deck. This means that your enemy&rsquo;s ground forces are approaching. Remove all alert tokens when you activate a damaged sector. If you have three or more alert tokens on your deck at the end of a round, enemy troops have infiltrated your juggernaut and taken control. You lose and your opponent wins.<br/><br/>Next, you and your opponent reveal your active cards and resolve them.  Once cards resolve, you discard them, draw cards to replace them, then play cards from your hand to fill in the ones that you discarded.<br/><br/>The mechanics are such that large Juggernauts with many-sided Commanders (d 12, d 20) have lots of &quot;hit points&quot;, but are easy to hit with attacks, difficult to get reliable results from, and vulnerable to accumulating alert tokens.  Small Juggernauts with few-sided Commanders (d4, d6) are difficult to hit and produce very predictable results, but have very few &quot;hit points&quot;.<br/><br/>Juggernauts is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5 License.

While the first pack contained new fighters, this one adds more Light Bombers and Formation aircraft to the  system.<br/><br/>The pack will include such famous aircraft as the B-25H (complete with 75mm gun) and the Il-2m3 Shturmovik. But there will be lesser-known planes as well, like the German Hs-129B-1/R2 (a sort of WWII version of today's A-10) and the Italian CANT Z.501 Gabbiano flying boat. All the cards will be printed in the eight-per-sheet (cut 'em out yourself) style of C3i-DiF module inserts that you've enjoyed over the years.<br/><br/>One of the difficulties in creating a pack of bombers and patrol planes is that up until now these aircraft types have only been used in the context of a Down in Flames campaign. The rules included in the pack provide three ways around this problem. First, there are guidelines for adding Formation aircraft to basic game dogfights. Second, the pack includes a number of stand-alone generic missions into which players can simply &quot;plug in&quot; appropriate aircraft. Finally, we have included rules (courtesy of Roger Horky) that allow Formation aircraft to engage in a form of dogfighting (called Gunnery Duels in the game) with other Formation planes. So if you've ever wanted to fly a Short Stirling against an FW-200 Condor, now is your chance.<br/><br/>Squadron Pack 2's rules also contain reprints of some of the rules from Corsairs and Hellcats for the benefit of those players who don't own that game (you know who you are). In addition, there are rules for two new ground attack weapons: the German Hs 293 radio-controlled air to surface missile and Fritz X radio-controlled glide bomb.<br/><br/>Like the first pack, Squadron Pack 2: Bombers will contain 64 new aircraft cards printed 8 to a sheet in the same enhanced graphic style as Squadron Pack 1. The pack will also include a short (4-8 page) rulebook and an 11x17 wrap around cover decorated with Rodger MacGowan's gorgeous artwork. The inside of the cover sheet will form a play mat for use during Gunnery Duels.<br/><br/>Developers: Mike Lemick and Rodger B.

Militarily, it had totally failed in the assigned objectives. For the August offensive, the NVA concentrated two divisions, the 5th and 9th. The 5th had grown to 15,000 men and elements of the plan called for the capture of American M113 APCs from the 10l ARVN squadron to infiltrate into the US headquarters for it's destruction. The plan also called for the divisions to be used piecemeal with the objective of killing Americans and occupying Tay Ninh City. Such an event would reap a political bonanza equal to the Tet Offensive. It was thought this would decimate US morale because War Zone C was well occupied by American troops. More important to the NVA plan was the hope that the awesome American airpower would be neutralized by the August monsoons.

Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.<br/><br/>One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings.

There's no bonus pieces in this game. Because all the pieces are separated according to their color, it's possible for a skillful player to put all the pieces in a pocket with only one strike.<br/><br/>Each player in a three or four player game may play with their own colors instead of forming teams with opposing players.<br/><br/>The Swedish Couronne is similar in that it typically has space behind the pockets and uses cues, but the pieces (usually 15 of each colour) are initially placed in the middle.

While it is designed in Australia, and uses a few Australian expressions, the content and theme are not noticeably Australian.<br/><br/>The playing area is a simulation of a planned city, divided into two zones : an inner Residential ring and an outer Industrial ring. The play proceeds on a circular track, with each ring containing a series of &ldquo;sites&rdquo;, of which two aggregate to a &ldquo;subdivision&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The ultimate objective is to &ldquo;evenly develop&rdquo; as many of these sites as possible, without going broke !<br/><br/>The Residential zone can be developed by building Cottages, Mansions, and Flats(apartments), while the Industrial zone is available for a variety of uses, represented by card &ldquo;shares&rdquo;( stocks). It is NOT necessary to land on a particular site to purchase it.<br/><br/>Players alternate between each ring according to dice throws, and pay penalties for landing on other Players&rsquo; sites. Several spaces mandate change of zone. Movement is subject to considerable randomization.<br/><br/>Each player receives an initial land allocation of two &ldquo;subdivisions&rsquo; (two sites each of Residential and Industrial) ; plus a cash &ldquo;float&rdquo;. Players proceed to buy development items, initially from the bank. The pool of available items is limited, to induce competition.<br/><br/>The inventory comprises: Cottages 14, Mansions 10, Flats 6 ( total 30). The space available to place these items totals 24. Prices range from a low of $100 for &ldquo;Cottages&rdquo; to $400 for a &ldquo;share&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Electronics&rdquo; factory. More expensive items eventually provide a disproportionately higher return, but may be too expensive in the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>Players are able to increase the value of their holdings by increasing the capital investment on each site from a single unit up to two units and/or more valuable buildings and upgraded shares. Any site must contain only identical items, but any subdivision may contain a mix ( eg cottages and mansions on adjacent sites; or, say, &ldquo;railway&rdquo; shares next to &ldquo;glass works&rdquo;).Various bonuses accrue when sites are &ldquo;double developed&rdquo; and/or when sites are &ldquo;evenly developed&rdquo;.<br/><br/>These development items are available initially from a bank, but soon become tradeable between Players. Players short of cash for Landing fees may even have to trade/sell at &ldquo;distress&rdquo; prices.<br/><br/>When all a Player&rsquo;s sites are &ldquo;evenly developed&rdquo;, Players can attempt to buy more <br/>(vacant) land, from the bank only.<br/><br/>The game has several unusual features:<br/>1. &ldquo;stock&rsquo; ( houses, shares etc) can be moved from one site to another, or even &ldquo;off board&rdquo; until required again.<br/>2. un-developed sites attract no landing fees (unlike Monopoly)<br/>3. there is some limited scope for trading of rationed items above their &ldquo;bank price&rdquo;, as Players seek to establish &ldquo;double developed&rdquo; sites<br/>4. The amount of cash available to any Player for buying at any one time is limited by certain arbitrary rules.<br/><br/>Possible faults :<br/>1. The supply of in-coming cash seems too small compared to the amount leaving the Game via random penalties.<br/>2. Arbitrary limits on Players ability to spend seem unnecessary.<br/>3.

(This rule applies even if you're trying to pass through a wall you created!)<br/><br/>Because walls apply equally to all players, it becomes dangerous to be too defensive. A diplomatic atmosphere emerges from these simple mechanics as your pieces dance around the board, avoiding walls and building new walls of their own.<br/><br/>From the Luchacabra website:<br/><br/>This elegant abstract board game is deceptively simple. Move your pieces like chess rooks, trying to get to the opposite corner of the board. Uninterrupted lines between your pieces form imaginary walls that no pieces, not even your own, can cross. That&rsquo;s it! Embargo is a strategic game of territorial control and sharing.<br/><br/>"}, "25630": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic523416.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"7696": {"name": "George Dew"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2005", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"15316": "Nicole Cardiff"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5841": {"name": "Dark City Games, Inc."}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic523416_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "description": "The Island of Lost Spells is a programmed adventure using Dark City Games Legends of the Ancient World rule set.

This 3-4 hour game thus lasts a maximum of twelve turns.<br/><br/>Players command infantry and cavalry armies, and for some factions fleets and aircraft. Leaders assist these units in movement and combat over land areas and sea zones. Each land area is rated for the amount of money and manpower it generates each turn. Manpower represents not just fresh recruits for armies, but also the things made with human labor: food, uniforms, weapons and so on. Factions thus use manpower to rebuild forces, and money to finance their actions. Combat is conducted by rolling dice, one for each attack factor, with hits reducing them in strength or eliminating them outright. A good general lets you roll more dice. Each area is also rated for its garrison strength; to capture it, you have to defeat the garrison troops through siege (in addition to driving off any enemy armies there).<br/><br/>Finally, to keep the game from becoming too &quot;Risk&quot;-like, players can play various event cards.

The primary goal of the game is to score points by answering questions on the above subjects, with individual turn actions keyed by a basic roll-and-move mechanic.<br/><br/>The significant twist in the game is that each player takes one of twenty cards sets, each set consisting of 11 cards.  Ten are clue cards related to a single black historical figure or celebrity.  Another card in each set has the person's name and picture.  During the game, the other players have the opportunity privately or publicly hear the clues and try to guess the character.  The clues are divulged based on the players answers to toss-up questions on cards (&quot;Words of Wisdom&quot; and &quot;Go Back to your Roots&quot;), drawn when they land on the corresponding squares.  Other squares allow free guessing of secret identities, answering questions for additional points, and other more typical roll-and-move actions.  Points for answers/guesses are tallied on paper for as the game progresses.<br/><br/>This game appears to have a good balance between movement, deduction, and trivia mechanics.  An unfortunate rule is that players who have their secret identities guessed are then out of the game, so it would help to have the most obscure figure possible.

With 4 action cards in hand per turn, you have seven turns in which to develop your domains by building various types of military, religious, and civil buildings. Depending on their size, certain buildings are moved in time, which means that they are transferred to the same place on the priories board (Renaissance period) and on the brotherhoods board (modern period), in ruins for military and religious buildings (castles, abbeys&hellip;).<br/><br/>Thanks to the watch makers' invention, and with enough money, you can make your two adventurer pawns travel in time&hellip; Because if the construction of certain buildings can be profitable, taking over domains on the various boards is essential, since it will allow you to earn bonuses on the 4th and 7th turns and to move ahead of your opponents.<br/><br/>Playing with time is not without consequences, and it can produce surprising results! To give just one example, an abbey created on the priories board could be destroyed by a castle built later in the game in the same place but on the commanderies board, and then moved to the other board&hellip; The abbey finally never existed!<br/><br/>On the 4th and 7th turns, each controlled domain generates profits for the players depending on the board. On the the commanderies board, a player who controls a domain militarily, i.e. the one with the biggest military building, will receive the value of the civil buildings in this domain in profits. On the priories board, it is the religious control that will be taken into account.

The game pieces include a wood game board, 2 dice (for the dice version), and 24 cork games pieces (hence, the name CORX). The instructions detail the dice version of CORX, which adds the element of chance, and the no-dice version (which involves moving your game pieces a pre-determined number of spaces each turn) that will appeal more to the serious chess, checkers, or go players.<br/><br/>The purpose of the game is to march your games pieces across the game board, capturing other players' corx, avoiding capture of your own, and trying to capture another player's &quot;Base&quot;.<br/><br/>Game pieces can be moved in any direction. Players can protect their own game pieces by forming &quot;Blocks&quot;, and the player who occupies &quot;Center Space&quot; has special privileges.<br/><br/>The game ends when a base is captured, and players then add up their points. The player with the highest score wins (which is often not the player who has ended the game by capturing a Base).<br/><br/>&quot;Match&quot; play involves playing 3 games, with the person who has the most match points winning the Match. Match points are awarded for each game won, and for having the most total game points. It is highly recommended that CORX be played in matches, as that adds another strategic dimension to the game. Because the winner of a match is determined by who has the most &quot;match points&quot; (instead of whoever wins 2 out of 3 games), players need to assess the &quot;big picture&quot; before making the decision to end a game.<br/><br/>Corx with dice works best with 3-4 players.

It is the time of Prohibition. 4 opposing gangs, each with 9 gangsters want to bring the city under their control. By playing out rows, each of which consist of 6 gangsters, players try to gain a majority through their most valuable gangsters. But careful! To gain powerful positions, sometimes sharpshooting is needed. The goal of the game is to become the most powerful of all, Al Capone. Tactics, strategy and cold-bloodedness will be required if you want to be celebrated as the boss of bosses in this game.<br/><br/>What gives the game its flair, apart from the real metal munitions, is the deft touch of the illustrator as well as court artist Robert Nippoldt. From corrupt mayor William Hale &quot;Big Bill&quot; Thompson to Boss of Bosses Al &quot;Scarface&quot; Capone, all of the major gangsters of this lead-filled time are represented.

But as each player has a unique victory condition, alliances never lasts long in the court of the king. There are three distinct phases in the game, in the Audience phase ressources are distributed, in the Diplomacy phase off-table diplomacy occurs and finally the Council Phase is where players will make and discuss petitions. There is also a heavy emphasis on roleplaying, and each card and ability is recommended to be acted out by the players, as the King can grant Favor to those who perform particularly dramatic or cunning.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/><br/>    31-page Rulebook<br/>    Seven Player Portfolios<br/>    Royal Bag of Coin<br/>    Coins of the Realm<br/>    200 cards divided into six different types<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "25769": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1933": {"name": "Ned Strongin"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Willi Wackel", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1994", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic167752_t.jpg", "average": "4", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3082": {"name": "Dujardin"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic167752.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"159527": "Dutch first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "The object of this game is to maintain the balance of poor Willi who is at the top of the ladder painting; you continually add paint buckets and hope he doesn't tip over.<br/><br/>"}, "25770": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Phonics Game", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "1994", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic160222_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"6034": {"name": "A Better Way of Learning"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic160222.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"159542": "Better Learning First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "This is a set of 6 educational card games based on the famous phonics learning method.

By placing gems, players put in place the components that will make them able to produce one of many different magic components. Those components will be used as reagents in the cure.<br/><br/>When playing, a player merely chooses an action among three :<br/><br/>     draw a new card<br/>     add a gem to the pattern, trying to put a reagent in play<br/>     move a gem on the pattern to another place, thus producing an 'alchemy reaction'.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The players use alchemy powers to prevent the opposing team from putting their reagents in play, or to speed up their own production, in order to produce the best cure for the king and be rewarded accordingly. The game ends as soon as one category of gems is depleted, so it is important to delay the end of the game if your team hasn't found the best cure yet.<br/><br/>The other side of the board presents a completely different game named the &quot;Epic Version&quot;, that includes more diplomacy and roleplaying features.<br/><br/>Players are powerful mages trying to save the city of Astoria from three disasters : a barbarian invasion, a revolt, and the wrath of a powerful dragon. They develop their powers by creating magic items and putting them in play. Magic items are from six different magic sources, and each source can be used for a different effect on the city. The players use those magical forces to fight off the barbarians and defend the city from the besieging forces. The barbarian hordes will also be reinforced by war chiefs and sorcerers that will add to the pressure on the city.<br/><br/>The players objective is still to find a cure to the illness of the king of Astoria. But some of the mages are also traitors, trying to lead the king to his final rest and give victory to one of the enemies of Astoria. Players have to watch each other, and may accuse another mage of treachery. They also have to keep an eye for the king's health, for if he dies, everything will be lost for the defenders.<br/><br/>The game has different endings : the king can die, or can be saved. Or the city may fall to the hands of one of the enemies of Astoria. If one of the enemy factions comes to its maximal force, the game immediately ends with the victory of this faction (and, possibly, the victory of the traitor that was secretly supporting it!).<br/><br/>Both the Combination and the Epic Versions use a scoring method that makes it possible for players to play the game in competition and tournaments.<br/><br/>"}, "25773": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic181973.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"428": {"name": "Dan Verssen"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2006", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": {"20433": "Martin Scott"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3683": {"name": "Dan Verssen Games (DVG)"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic181973_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"2650": {"name": "Aviation / Flight"}}, "description": "Down In Flames - WWI depicts the fun and flavor of World War I aerial dogfighting.

It is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Eastern Front, Road to Berlin and Battle of the Bulge to play all of the scenarios.<br/>While the Soviet Guards are of excellent quality, the supplement also includes German Air Force (Luftwaffe) ground troops of rather dubious merit, plus German Army forces.<br/>Scenarios cover actions of these units in the first two years of the Great Patriotic War, many of them focused on the Soviet Operation Mars, also the subject of our Red God of War game at the operational scale. This supplement lets you explore the same battle at a more detailed level.<br/><br/>The pieces and half of the scenarios appeared in our Heroes of the Soviet Union game, released in 2001 and long since retired to Valhalla.

This is a<br/>game were everybody plays equally - not where one player controls the bad guys and everybody<br/>responds/submits to his decisions. Each player controls his own little band of misfits AND controls<br/>the critters that another player will encounter. Each player is someone else's nemesis.<br/>All encounter and miscellaneous event rolls are done in the open, and are a surprise for everybody<br/>to enjoy. The whole point of this little endeavor is for everybody to have fun, so it helps<br/>if you don't take things too seriously. These rules are not intended as an overly detailed, exhaustive<br/>study in the complexities of subterranean armored combat. Nor will they require you<br/>to undertake a prolonged course of study in order to properly equip and prepare your party for<br/>eventual world domination.<br/>&quot;Elegance in Simplicity&quot; is the rule, even when it comes to brawling in the dark recesses of the<br/>dungeons. Hopefully you will find DungeonCrawl to be reasonably quick and reasonably fun.<br/>Enjoy.<br/>All players will begin the game with essentially equal parties. In the standard game, parties are<br/>composed of 1 fighter, 1 archer, 1 cleric, 1 thief, and 1 mage. For more advanced games, players<br/>may customize their party to suit their playing style. All players have roughly the same goal<br/>&ndash; get their party out alive with as much loot as possible. In the basic game, the winner is determined<br/>by the player with the most loot at the end. More advanced games have differing goals,<br/>or specific objectives to be accomplished in order to claim victory.<br/>But it all boils down to:<br/>Kill Critters, Get Goodies; try to get out alive so you can brag about it.<br/><br/>"}, "25811": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Feeding Frenzy", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1998", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic518180_t.jpg", "average": "3.25", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"6043": {"name": "Big Eye Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic518180.jpg", "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Two games in one!<br/><br/>FEEDING FRENZY<br/><br/>Eat your way to the top in this fast, fun, frenzied game!

As soon as one player has all his pirates in Pirate's Nest, he can raise the Jolly Roger and win the game.<br/><br/>The game is a sequel to Cartagena with the pirates trying to figure out what to do now that they have escaped from the prison.<br/><br/>Inside the box:<br/><br/>    5 game board pieces with 7 symbols: parrot, treasure chest, spyglass, dukats, treasure map, cannon, and compass<br/>    3 Game board parts: boat, Pirate's Nest and Jolly Roger flag<br/>    105 cards - 15 cards of each symbol: parrot, treasure chest, spyglass, dukats, treasure map, cannon, and compass plus 1 of each symbol with gold border<br/>    30 pirate figures 6 each of five colors<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Each player receives seven cards. A turn consists of taking at least one and up to three of the following actions:<br/>1) Play a card and move a pirate forward to the next unoccupied matching symbol.<br/>2) Move an opponent&rsquo;s pirate forward to the next space with one or two pirates on it (you may not skip over pirates), then draw one card for each pirate already there (max. 3 pirates on any one space at the same time).<br/>3) Sail the boat between the islands.<br/><br/>To sail the boat to the second island, you must have at least one pirate in the boat. If, at the start of your turn, your pirates outnumber the pirates of your opponent/s, you may sail the boat as a free action. You can only move the boat back to the first island if you still have at least one pirate on the first island.<br/><br/>There is no hand limit, but if a player plays a card with a yellow border, all players must discard down to 7 cards.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to move all his pirates into the Pirate's Nest and raise the flag.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"176256": "Nilco Greek edition"}, "average": "6.47395", "name": "Cartagena 2.

There are 19 named glyphs of various sizes from 1 to 9 orthogonally adjacent squares.  Glyphs that you form during play are worth points.  The majority of points scored in a mini grid wins the mini grid.  The winner of the majority of mini grids wins the game.<br/><br/>For the complete rules to Scribe, see <a target='_blank' href='http://marksteeregames.com/' rel='nofollow'>http://marksteeregames.com/</a><br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>    Super Duper Games<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"33372": "Print and Play edition"}, "name": "Scribe", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2055": "Paper-and-Pencil"}, "average": "4.79412", "usersrated": "17", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"26432": "Combinatorial"}}, "25866": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic219151.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"618": {"name": "Ken Fisher"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2006", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"11883": "Franz Vohwinkel"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"8": {"name": "AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH"}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic219151_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Wizard Junior uses the same game play as its older brother, Wizard, with players bidding on the number of tricks they will take during a hand, but simplifies things for the younguns so they can get a handle on trumps and tricks.

But first U have to get your driving license. This is done by moving on the track on the board and learning/respecting the road code (speed limit, unique direction). Several things can happen on the board: an accident, blown tire,... There also is a garage, a gangster, a d&eacute;panneur (troubleshooter) and a gangster that can be met on the board.

You take risks and develop strategies.  You will experience 'the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.'  But win or lose, you will know that you have been in a game!&quot;<br/><br/>This is a fairly typical &quot;special interest&quot; roll-and-move game with a psychoanalytical theme and a couple unique twists.<br/><br/>As players move around the outer track, they collect ID, EGO, and WOW!/OW! (Superego) cards through square instructions and a Chance card mechanism.  You use these cards throughout the game to buy BUTTONS and ZAPPERS, and to avoid penalties.<br/><br/>Linked at the corners of the outer track are four independent alternate routes, one each for the themes IS/EGO/SE and GONE BANANAS.  While on these alternate paths you have the chance to earn a BUTTON (literally) of the corresponding color...but each path also entails risk and expense.<br/><br/>Some of the squares along the outer track where &quot;Chance&quot; cards are had can be &quot;owned&quot; by players by buying ZAPPERS with ID cards.  Once bought, the squares are marked with one of the player's ZAPPER tokens.  That player gets benefits for landing on the ZAPPER, while his opponents landing there have to give him a BUTTON or WOW! cards, and the opponent gets all his OW!s.  Each ZAPPER location can be bought and re-bought (at a higher price) throughout the game.<br/><br/>The game ends immediately when one player has buttons of all four colors (representing a balanced personality) and more WOW!s than OW!s (representing positive self-worth...I guess).<br/><br/>The production value is first-class, as is the professional artwork on the nicely-mounted board.  The bits are plastic and specially designed for the game - the player tokens are bananas on a little colored base.  The cards are the only weak spot, small print on heavily-colored, cheapish  card stock.<br/><br/>The double goal and constant shift of buttons might make this game a cut above the standard RaM fare.  Keeping resource cards and buttons hidden would also increase the fun...and the chaos.  I've had many of these low-volume specialty games pass through my thrifting hands, and this may be the first I actually try.

Both can be played using the same components. Kariba, the main game, is a 2 player variant inspired by the Mancala game family. Kalak is a Marbles variant, or rather, a pebble-flicking dexterity game whose arena is created by assembling the 2 piece jigsaw board in an alternative way. Kalak is mainly aimed at younger players.<br/><br/>KARIBA<br/>This variation on the age-old Kalah game keeps the familiar sowing movement rules, but it introduces an alternative way to capture stones and dramatically changes the way the board is used. It also introduces new types of pebbles. They now come in 3 different colours, each with its own value, and one even with a special protective ability. The board shows 2 large scoring pits at either end of the board. Between them, 2 rows of just 4 pits are sitting side by side. Each player is assigned one row of 4 that ends in their private scoring pit. This row is the only row in which a player will place their own pieces and it should be obvious that the players move in opposite directions.<br/><br/>At the start, both players get a set of 25 stones that forms the supply, and these are kept beside the board. It is a mix of 3 types: 20 stones that are worth 1 point, 3 treasure stones that are worth 2, and 2 guard stones that are not only worth 3 points, but also protect all stones in a pit from capture, as long as a black stone is not caught out sitting on its own. By itself, a guard stone is equally vulnerable to capture.<br/><br/>In turn, players pick up 1-4 tones from supply and move them onto the board, or remove all stones from one of their own pits and move these further along the track towards the scoring pit. To move a hand of stones, the player chooses the first hand stone and drops it into the pit it would reach next on its way to the scoring pit. Then, 1 stone is dropped in each pit thereafter until a player's hand is empty. When a player manages to drop a stone into the scoring pit (here players are forced to drop the lowest value stone), it is safe and counts toward their end total. All remaining hand stones go back to supply and must start all over again. When one player has no more stones left to move, the game ends. Players add up the total points in their own pit. The loser ignores any stones left en-route on the board, but subtracts the value of the stones still in supply from this total. The player with the highest score wins, with simple tie-breakers provided.<br/><br/>What makes this game interesting is the way by which opposing pieces are captured. When a stone is placed in an empty hole, all opposition stones that sit beside it and are not protected by at least one guard stone are captured and are immediately added to the pit of the capturing player, boosting that player's score. The high stone total triggers the need for continued protection from capture by Guard Stones, which adds to the deliberations to be made. Guards stones will be deliberately played so they overshoot the scoring pit, ensuring their continued services as protectors of all other stones on their way to the scoring pit. However, sacrifices will have to be made, making continual forward planning a requirement for victory.<br/><br/>KALAK<br/>By flipping over one side of the jigsaw board, a flat surface is revealed for the bottom half of the board, and that leaves a square of 4 small pits with 1 large one directly above it at the top. The player sits at the base of the flat surface board, and makes a smiling pebble face by placing 2 black pupil stones in the lower &quot;eye socket&quot; pits, 2 blue ones underneath the nose-shaped jigsaw lock to make nostrils, and by creating a smiling mouth of the remaining 8 blue stones underneath.<br/><br/>In phase 1, the player flicks each blue stone once, trying to reach the large target pit at the top. Only blue stones that fall into this pit can be taken into the second phase, the rest are removed. In phase 2, the player places all surviving stones in a single row on the bottom edge, including the 2 eye stones if more than 4 stones survived the first phase. Again, stones are all flicked once, but this time the player determines their end score. Each pitted stone scored one point, but player's will have to spread the stones out across all pits, as any stones that supercede the maximum capacity set for each pit in this phase are worthless. Optional rules to make it harder by using special landing restrictions for the then also more valuable eye stones, or making it easier by relaxing the set-up for phase 2 are also included.<br/><br/>PUBLICATION HISTORY:<br/><br/>     2006 Kariba (including Kalak) Clemens Gerhards - deluxe wooden version - in print (last checked oct 2006)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Clemens Gerhards produces their wooden games range to high standards, and this is no exception.

In English speaking countries it was published as Siege, or German Tactics.  Since it is played on essentially a Fox &amp; Geese board with additional markings and pieces, it was often included in a set with rules for Fox &amp; Geese and Solitaire.  The markings outline one nine-point side of the cross as a distinct fortress or castle, typically in a different color from the rest of the board's points.  Also, the horizontal lines of the board are in a different color than the rest, but for the few closest to the fortress.  This is to indicate where the attacker may not move; in some editions these markings are absent and instead simply described by the player's rules of movement.<br/><br/>The defending player has two pieces in the fortress, either on specific starting points or anywhere the player chooses, depending on the included rules.  The other player has twenty-four pieces, one on each of the board's remaining points.  The goal for the attacking player is to occupy all nine of the fortress points with one of his pieces.  The goal for the defending player is to reduce the attacker to eight pieces, thereby preventing occupation of the fortress.<br/><br/>Attackers may move along the vertical or diagonal lines towards the fortress only, except on the few marked horizontal lines near the fortress.  They may not jump or capture any pieces.  The defenders may move in any direction along any line, and may capture (remove from the board) an attacker's piece by jumping over it to a vacant opposite point.<br/><br/>Siege evolved further into a larger edition with a sixty-seven point board, seventeen points for the fortress (and three defending pieces) and fifty points for the attackers.

To control complexity and present an overall-force-commander's-view of the battle, the game uses a tactically scaled map and units of maneuver coupled with an operationally scaled game turn length. The American player is generally on the offensive, trying to clear the entire Japanese defending force from the city prior to the end of the game.<br/><br/>Each game turn of M'45 equals three days.

The units of maneuver in the game are companies, batteries and battalions, representing anywhere from a about 100 to 1,000 men and their equipment.<br/><br/>Historically the Japanese fought to the last man (literally, not metaphorically), and the game's victory conditions represent that brutally absolute mindset. To determine the winner, both players examine the map at the end of Game Turn 10. If at that time there's one or more Japanese units still in play anywhere, the Japanese player is declared to have won the game. If there are no Japanese units left on the map at that time, the US player is declared to have won the game.

The Paraguayan player is primarily on the defensive, but the situation also allows for his prosecution of offensives, particularly in the early stage of the war.<br/><br/>Game play encompasses the period that began historically in 1865 with the Paraguayans launching a preemptive strike into Argentine territory. The game ends during the first half of 1868 when, historically, the Allies broke through the Paraguayan river forts and went on to seize their capital. That advance signaled the ultimate doom of the Paraguayan cause and, though the war officially went on for another year and a half, that portion of it was more a rebellion-and-occupation struggle than an actual war.<br/><br/>Each hexagon on the map represents approximately 15.5 miles (25 km) from side to opposite side.

The German player is generally on the offensive, attempting to win the game by isolating or capturing Moscow, or by seizing all the other key cities on map. The Soviet player is primarily on the defensive, but the situation also requires that he prosecute local counterattacks.<br/><br/>Play encompasses the period that began with the Germans launching their offensive on 1 October 1941 and ends on 7 December of the same year. By that time it had become clear the invaders had shot their bolt without achieving their objective. Play may end sooner than the historic termination time if either player concedes defeat prior to the official end of a game.<br/><br/>Each hexagon on the map represents 7.5 miles (12 kilometers) from side to opposite side. The units of maneuver for both sides are primarily divisions, along with some brigades and one elite super-elite regiment. The effects of the general air superiority enjoyed by the Germans throughout much of the campaign are built into the game's movement and combat rules. Each game turn represents a week.

(SL) is a low-to-intermediate complexity, two-player, operational simulation (with important tactical undertones) of riverine combat the Mekong Delta during the Vietnam War. There are two players: the Free World, including US, South Vietnamese and other allies; and the Communists, including Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army forces. The objective of the Communist player is to infiltrate men and supplies via the Mekong Delta's many waterways, while also attacking critical Free World bases and towns across the region. The Free World player is attempting to prevent that infiltration while also conducting an offensive against Communist formations and bases.<br/><br/>Each player has available several types of riverine and ground units, as well as air units for the Free World player. The Communist player can make use of special rules representing that side's advantage in intelligence and local guerrillas. The system uses an 'operational impulse' system. That is, a player moves and fights with one of his forces, followed by his opponent doing the same with a force of the other side. Every operation requires the expenditure of command points.<br/><br/>SL has several different scenarios, each covering a critical period of operations: Game Warden (the early years), Tet (the Communist general offensive of 1968), and SEALORDS (the Free World counteroffensive of 1969-70).<br/><br/>Each map grid square equals 6.21 miles (10 km) across, and each full game turn represents a month.
