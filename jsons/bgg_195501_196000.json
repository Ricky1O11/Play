If you want to establish new cities, you&rsquo;ll build schooners or airships to reach faraway lands and flying islands.

The historic outcome was a pyrrhic victory for the Chinese.<br/><br/>I made this game because I am in awe of what happened at this battle. Of what the marines accomplished. In my opinion it was a modern day Thermopylae. The difference between the two battles being that in Thermopylae the Spartans were at least able to take advantage of the Terrain to minimize the Persian&rsquo;s numerical advantage. But in this battle the US forces were completely surrounded. They had no way of evening the odds at all. But somehow, caused such devastation to the Chinese forces that they had to permanently disband 2 of their divisions and the remaining divisions were still under-strength for 7 months.<br/><br/>You control the United Nations X-Corps, which primarily consisted of US Marine and Army forces. Particularly the 1st Marine Division and 7th Infantry Division.<br/><br/>The game&rsquo;s AI system will control the Chinese forces as they come pouring over the border into Korea and surround you.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Components<br/><br/>     Board<br/>     Rules<br/>     25 cards (2.5&quot;x3.5&quot;; 63.5mmx88mm)<br/>     11 counters<br/>     2 standees<br/>     20 cubes<br/>     1 six-sided die<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",

However, the right cards needed in this game may not be the right cards in another game. True, you may pull the same set of cards, but it is highly unlikely there are 531,441 different combinations. You could push ahead getting the right cards in the positions you need them to be in, or do you work to thwart other players efforts. Adding the change a winning combination of the ideal kingdom allows for changes in strategy from one game to the next. Each player starts with three cards and needs to work to create the &ldquo;Ideal Kingdom&rdquo; which is a combination of six cards. Each color of card has specific attacks, defense, and special action. Certain colors cards can only sit next to other certain color cards, and coming in contact with opposing cards leads to inactivity or removal. That has something to do with court politics. Cards are drawn and played in turn order, with actions being directed by the cards you have laid out in front of you. Some of those actions allow you to draw extra cards, look at another player&rsquo;s cards, steal cards, or battle. But, your strategy has to be planned so you can create the ideal kingdom to win. There are 9 major game changer cards in the deck, like creating Immunity from the Black Plague, or Jesters that will play tricks and change the cards. This actually helps the player with the least amount of cards to actually come back and try to win.<br/><br/>"

So hurry while the wind is brave in your sails! Sail from island to island, scouting, fighting, looting for treasure, and spending your loot to live out tale worthy adventures.<br/><br/>GOAL<br/>Be the last surviving pirate with the best adventure to tell.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>Players take action using the map draw deck to expand the board, move, search for resources, place workers, complete adventure cards, and attack each other. As each round ends the AI player increases strength and moves in to attack the nearest player. This forces players to end their turn as far away as possible by either expanding the map or moving. Resources in hand and large boards will result in shorter rounds making it harder as the game progresses. Players not eliminated by the AI or other players win.

That's a revenge that will last forever.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>Characters in the game are defined by Abilities (Attributes), Resources, Values, and Threads (Traits).  Abilities range from 2 to 10 and, sometimes, higher.  Each Ability is aligned with a suit in a stripped deck of French playing cards:  Passion (Hearts), Logic (Spades), Truthiness (Clubs), and Reputation (Diamonds).  The Ability rank corresponds to a card rank, used during conflict resolution.  Character Resources are much like Skills but are more inclusive.  Values are narrative traits that define the character's inviolate principles.  Finally, Threads represent the efforts the character is engaged in.<br/><br/>While the game can be played with a single deck of cards, play is greatly facilitated by the use of multiple decks with different backs.<br/><br/>"

The floor plan must connect 2 external doors via a corridor (described as a very long room) with doors leading off to rooms. Each room scores you one point. But each penalty subtracts one point. The 3 design principles that cause a penalty are: doors that open onto walls, missing walls (making a room or corridor open to the outside world), and rooms that are inaccessible.<br/><br/>",

The spaces are not connected equally and some spaces have an advantage when doing a ranged attack. Players move tokens on the board trying to eliminate the opponent's pieces and be as close as possible to their opponent's picnic spot at the end of the game. Players take actions by playing their hand of 8 cards, or both sides of the four cards. The game ends at the end of round 8, or after all cards have been played.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>Players choose 1 card from their hand (either the top or bottom half of that card) and simultaneously reveal them. The player with the highest initiative number (in the coin) goes first, and each player either takes 1 of the 2 actions on their card's chosen half or passes. Cards that have been played once are flipped from the silver coin side to the gold coin side and return to the players hand; cards played twice are discarded.<br/><br/>On their turn a player may move 1 or more of their tokens, attack in the same location or a target location, block, hide, taunt, or add 1 reinforcement. Although the actions are resolved in order (highest number card), a block or hide can cancel a certain type of attack as a reaction or preemptively.<br/><br/>The game ends after 8 rounds, when all cards have been discarded. Equidistant tokens are removed after which the player nearest to the opponent's star wins.<br/><br/>"

Each game consists of three rounds in which players draft cards from their hands to build their kingdom. Each card is one of five suits and also has a scoring objective.<br/><br/>After all cards have been drafted for the round, players total their points based on the suits of cards they collected and the scoring objectives on each card, then they record their score. Each round, the players each select one card to leave in their kingdom as a &quot;relic of the past&quot; to help them in later rounds. After three rounds, the player with the the most prosperous kingdom wins.<br/><br/>Tides of Madness adds a new twist to the above game: madness. Some cards, while powerful, harm your psyche, so you must keep an eye on your madness level or else risk losing the game early as your mind is lost to the power of the ancients. More specifically, eight of the eighteen cards in the game feature a madness icon, and while scoring, you receive a madness token for each such icon in your collection of cards. Whoever has the most madness in a round either scores 4 points or discards 1 madness token &mdash; and the latter option is valuable because if you ever have nine or more madness, you lose the game immediately.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "How many of you remember the old videogames of the '80s &ndash; '90s where you had to be extremely skilled in cabinet to strip completely super-pixelled girls?<br/><br/>Oppai Go has been created from this idea, a &ldquo;strategic&rdquo; game in which each player has a sexy female alter ego taken on a desert island as a sort of &ldquo;Battle Royale&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Hunger Games&rdquo;, with the exception of only wearing underwear. Unfortunately the fate is not by your side (or maybe yes?), because you will be &ldquo;forced&rdquo; to use every means at your disposal to fully undress your opponents and try to earn your way back home.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to have the most victory points at the end. Players get VP by stripping their opponents of their clothes (or accessories).<br/><br/>The accessory token moves from one space to another to denote the state of dress of each character. The possible states are as follows:<br/>1. Naked: The accessory token is off the character sheet and the character is flipped to the naked side<br/>2. Pants: The character is only wearing pants (token on pants space)<br/>3. Bra: The character is wearing bra and pants (token on bra space)<br/>4. Armor: The character is wearing bra and pants, and also armor (token on armor space)<br/>5. Weapon: The character has a weapon, armor, bra and panties (token on weapon space)<br/><br/>The game is divided into rounds, each round is split into phases. Note that some phases are played in clockwise order and some others in anticlockwise order.<br/><br/>Each player faces a round always with 3 cards in hand, drawing them from the central common deck. Cards could have some effects like removing accessories to an opponent (or to everyone), gain 1 accessory, defend from opposing actions, etc.<br/><br/>The cards can be played by the hand, can be held (covered) on the table (to be played during the next rounds) or can be discarded. All played cards form a sort of pile in order to activate their effects from the last played card to the first one.<br/><br/>The held cards go always on the top of the pile, so their effects start first. There's only one problem: the card on the top of the discard pile determines the Seed, that is the color of cards that cannot be played among the held ones.<br/><br/>This is a game full of funny surprises, bluff, ruthless combos and embarrassing situations.<br/><br/>",

So when the bard Villeim Teatteri discovers an ancient site dedicated to Naytella, he knows what he must do; convert an entire town to her calling! But how to do that, and where to start? Everyone likes to see a good show and have a chance to share a drink or three with new friends, so Teatteri and his theatrical troupe set out to ensure both of these happen. But more is going on behind the scenes than meets the eye, and a voice of dissent asks the PCs to help restore order.

His evil had no mortal equal, and hopeless lament was the only bounty of his subjects. For generations the tyrant ruled unopposed until the Order of the Sacred Dawn challenged his cruelty. By the charge of a powerful and benevolent deity, six holy knights were bestowed with an artifact of tremendous power. Wielding the relic known as the lucespel, the order vanquished Tenebrash and light was returned to the weary world. The knights bound the vengeful spirit of the dragon within their stronghold, and sacrificed their own mortality to eternally guard the artifact from those who would misuse its power. With the return of evil to the realm, a new quest has been called: venture into the ruins of the ancient keep to retrieve the lucespel. Those who seek to harness its holy essence will face the ultimate challenge to prove both their valor and virtue.<br/><br/>"

The game master, or &quot;primary storyteller&quot; narrates the overall story; the remaining players assume the characters of significance and narrate their own actions.  At any point, a character may interrupt the current story to tell one of their own in a &quot;nested storytelling&quot; event; once the story-in-a-story concludes the interrupted story resumes.  A set of customized character cards is used to spur creativity (ten sample cards are provided).  A timer may be used to limit the length of various stories, though this is optional.  Finally, a large number of tokens is used to control access to significant narrative input (to assure all players get a roughly equal time in the spotlight).<br/><br/>"

You must battle insane raiders who occupy the void between cities, taking on missions from the three factions that have divided up the last of civilization: the fascist New Republic Army, is hellbent on bringing the world to heel for its own good; the heretical Oracles of Ceres, who have turned their attention to the worship of the land; and the technologically obsessed Archivists, who cling to the old ways and the hope of restoring our lost civilization.<br/><br/>But what do you care?

Outfit your truck, hire some insane riders to help fend off raiders, add some storage, and just keep truckin'.<br/><br/>Wasteland Express Delivery Service includes an emergent narrative story that unfolds over the course of 10 sessions. Each scenario begins with a beautifully illustrated comic book introduction that sets up the storyline and the constantly escalating stakes and challenges in front of players. Alternatively, players can dive in with a randomly generated scenario that will play out over the course of a single story-driven game session.<br/><br/>",

There's so little cheese around, and mousetraps are everywhere! <br/> Not only that, enemy mice are afoot, armed to the teeth with crossbows, plasma grenades, shotguns, flamethrowers, bazookas, evil space lasers and a host of special powers! <br/> In the fast-paced card game Cheese Or Die, players take on the role of mice competing to horde the most cheese, whilst arming up in a bid to steal cheese from their opponents. Will you take your chances and draw from the Cheese Deck - a deck which becomes increasingly 'dangerous' as the game goes on - or play the long game by collecting weapons and bonuses, and smashing your rivals in combat?<br/><br/>To win, you'll need to be ruthless and pick your fights carefully.<br/> Oh, and avoid proximity mines...<br/><br/>In Cheese Or Die, the first player to collect 6 cheese cards wins... but this can be difficult! To do this, players can attack opponents by choosing a weapon card from their hand, adding any bonuses, and playing any number of special cards on top. Expect brutal fights with lots of surprises! Special cards allow you to alter the normal victory conditions of the game, or mess with your opponents' combat total, for example. Only if attackers win can they draw a card from the defender's cheese cards. Just don't draw a mine!<br/><br/>There's also the Cheese Deck, which has its own dynamics. Players can take a chance and draw directly from this deck, or set traps for their opponents by looking ahead and loading the deck.<br/><br/>All in all this is a fast, fun and tense card game that provides some hilarious moments! <br/><br/><br/>"

The game is subtitled a &quot;youdunit&quot; because every character, during creation, is assumed to be the guilty party.  A character's backstory must include enough incriminating and contradictory data to &quot;prove&quot; they are guilty of the murder - if the information can be discovered by other characters during play.  The game proceeds in scenes with players taking turns as the primary narrator for a scene.<br/><br/>Characters have three Attributes:  Brains, Beauty, and Braun [sic].  These have a &quot;Stat&quot; or numeric rating.  Characters also have various other Traits that allow them to investigate and find out about other character's secrets.  Action resolution uses a dice pool that yields a success count.<br/><br/>Note the game author/submitter was known only as &quot;secret&quot; on the forums.  The game was entered as an text file.<br/><br/>"

The game crosses over heroines from various visual novels and games released by Nitroplus, as well as those from manga and anime series that Nitroplus writers have been involved with. The game was released in arcades on April 30, 2015 and was released on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 in collaboration with Marvelous Entertainment's Marvelous Inc. on December 10, 2015. Marvelous USA published the game in North America in February 2, 2016. It is the sequel to the doujin game Nitro+ Royale: Heroines Duel.<br/><br/>The game uses five buttons; light attack, medium attack, heavy attack, escape action, and heavy action. The escape action button can be used to perform evasive maneuvers and guards while heavy actions can be used to push an opponent back. Players can perform Infinite Blasts, which can interrupt an opponent's attack, Variable Rushes, which allows for surprise combos, and Lethal Blazes, which serve as the game's super combo attacks. Players can also choose two support characters which they can summon to assist them.<br/><br/>There are 32 characters which are split up into playable characters and support characters. Super Sonico was initially a support character, but was later made playable.

That group of agents has dared defy the Chronomancer to restore the Reality and Time's order&quot;.<br/><br/>Chronomancer is a cooperative board game, for 2-6 players with a 1-3 hrs/game duration, set in metropolitan areas in hot-spot countries all around the world. Each player controls an Agent of the Chrono Team and has to complete the Mission of the game by recovering weapons, valuables and ancient artifacts. Moving through a scenario that simulates a dangerous city, Agents will fight against mercenaries, evil bosses, powerful creatures that came from the past, and sometimes with the Chronomancer too.<br/><br/>Different kinds of action are available for each Agent, such as melee, fire-arm attacks, technological tools and bombing raids.<br/><br/>The main feature of Chronomancer is the modular design of the board that allows creating countless environments and collision situations, offering a new game experience at every time.<br/><br/>Depending on the missions and on the related objective to be achieved, Chronomancer also suggests a multiple level game structure and an evolving plot. All the Agents get involved in the main quest that must be completed for the final Victory. Each Agent can earn honor points during the fulfillment of the mission, but will also have his/her own agenda of personal goals to be reached. If the main quest has been resolved, the Agent with the greater amount of honor points wins over everyone. Moreover, by following the numerical order of the main missions (Mission 1, Mission 2, etc.), you will discover the Chronomacer's plans, living a long adventure game by game. But you can also pick missions at random and play them on their own, with different sets and enemies every time.<br/><br/>A modular board, 10 mission, 8 characters, 4 bosses an several time themed creature and characters from the past grant an always new gaming experience and great longevity.<br/><br/>"

Each player has an IT project assigned, in which a bunch of little, nasty bugs are hidden. 64 of these ulcer causing monsters must be eliminated for the project to run smoothly. The first bug-free player wins the game. You're not a developer, but are a part of the IT world? Don&rsquo;t worry, Bug Industries has enough bugs and fun for you as well.<br/><br/>The game rules: On the game board &ndash; the headquarters of Bug Industries &ndash; you move your game chip up or down &ndash; depending on whether you can deduct or receive more bugs. You roll two dice: a numbered dice called &ldquo;bug dice&rdquo; and an &ldquo;action dice.&rdquo; The result of the bug dice can be directly deducted from your total bug count. The action dice gives you different options: pause, roll the dice again, draw a bugs card or draw a code card.<br/><br/>There are two kinds of bug cards: The good ones reduce your total bug count and the bad ones increase it. With the second type of cards (code cards) you can influence the whole game. While you have to play the bug cards immediately, you can keep the code cards for yourself without showing them to the other players and then play them when the time is right. Knowing when to drop the code cards on the other players is a key part of the strategy.<br/><br/>"

The stock market had crashed. Businesses failed. Millions were soon to be thrown out of formerly secure jobs. Thanks to the experiment called Prohibition, organized crime controlled many sectors of a now faltering economy. The gangster had been romanticized in books and films and even pulp magazines like Gangster Stories and The Underworld. Their bloody depredations were tolerated, even celebrated, during the good times because no one knew how to legislate a thirst for alcohol out of existence.<br/><br/>Once the Depression settled over a frightened nation, tolerance became a luxury. With Repeal in 1934, the gangster no longer had an exclusive lock on the lubrication of sorrow. He had become too powerful, too brutal and the underworld was now moving into more vicious territory&shy; drugs and white slavery.<br/><br/>America began looking for heroes&hellip;..<br/><br/>"

        "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The Microlite75 Standard rules are based on three little booklets found in the boxed set of the 1974 original edition (0e) of the world&rsquo;s most popular tabletop fantasy roleplaying game and its supplements -- that is, everything that most groups used from 0e in the 1970s. The rules are not intended to be a clone of the 0e rules, but rather a conversion of them to a rules-lite D20-based system that encourages old-school play without strictly old-school rules. Microlite75 Standard is based on the third edition of the original Microlite74 rules, modified to use advancement and experience systems closer to those of the original game and including some of more popular systems from Microlite74 Extended (e.g. Body Points and Backgrounds).<br/><br/>Although the Microlite75 Standard rules are complete, they assume that the GM understands the basic concepts of roleplaying games.  Information for both the GM and the players on the various &ldquo;old school&rdquo; styles of play is provided. Microlite75 games can easily use adventures and material from early editions of the world&rsquo;s most popular tabletop fantasy roleplaying game or modern clones.<br/><br/>This book contains the complete rules for Microlite75 Standard. This 56 page book includes:<br/><br/>    Simple Character Creation Rules: Roll 4 attributes and select a race, class, background, and (optionally) alignment.<br/>    Standard Classes: Fighter, Magic-User, Cleric, and Thief.<br/>    Optional Classes: Assassin, Druid, Illusionist, Paladin, Ranger.<br/>    Backgrounds provide a simple and fast way to factor in a character's culture and non-class-related abilities.<br/>    Simple and fast-playing combat system that tracks physical damage (aka body points) separately from luck/skill/fatigue (aka hit point) damage.<br/>    Hit points recover with a night&rsquo;s rest. Spells cost hit points to cast. Actual wounds recover more slowly.<br/>    Rules for hirelings; monster reactions (not every monster wants to fight); morale (not every monster fights to the death); strongholds; magical research; dungeon, wilderness and ocean exploration; poison; and more.<br/>    A complete list of spells, monsters, and treasure.<br/>    Compatible with most other 0e based games and adventures.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Most of these are so familiar to us from comics, movies, games, and novels that they're &quot;strange&quot; only in the sense that we don't deal with them in our daily lives. Although this lack of evidence leads to disagreements over the details, every gamer has a clear personal picture of magic, psionics, super-powers, and similar phenomena.<br/><br/>But then there's the really strange stuff - the powers that push the limits of imagination itself.<br/><br/>GURPS Powers: The Weird is your guide to the mad science, uncanny realms, and bizarre superhuman abilities found in corners of fantasy, horror, and science fiction that attract labels like &quot;bizarro,&quot; &quot;psychedelic,&quot; and &quot;surreal.&quot; It goes beyond safe stereotypes to explore powers that warp the human form, sanity, and reality itself. Take a look, if you dare, and unearth:<br/><br/>Weird Science. Eleven structured styles of mad and fringe science - ranging from early psychical research and Frankensteinian experimentation to sci-fi nanotech and para-energetics - let you invent unlikely technologies, explore impossible realms, and tinker with the nature of life itself. What could go wrong?<br/><br/>Weird Realms and Phenomena. Learn of novel ways to use familiar story elements such as outer space and time travel to put a bizarre twist on your campaign . . . and discover completely new strangeness like singularities and metaphysical realms.<br/><br/>Weird Powers. The powers of Dimensional Control, Logos, Metamateriality, Mutation, Noumena, Para-Energy, Parasitism, and Void take GURPS Powers to the outer limits, with 65 fully worked sample abilities that push the boundaries of body, mind, and natural laws.<br/><br/>All of this comes with ample notes on the new and variant traits needed to think and act outside the box, plus plenty of advice to GMs who don't want to tether their campaigns to mere reality. Only one question is left unanswered: Can you handle the truth?<br/><br/>- Publisher's description<br/><br/>"

It is what it is. We call it &quot;story gaming.&quot;<br/><br/>You'll need two to five friends to story game. It will take between one and three hours, depending on how many people are involved. What you're going to do is create a short story that can be tied together with other short stories to weave an epic involving the world you've created.<br/><br/>Generally, everyone playing will have the same things to do, but sometimes the &quot;host&quot; will have special duties. This is usually the person who invited everyone to play a story game or the person who owns the Inuma set, but it can be anyone you designate.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>The Yellow Book focuses on cooperatively creating and detailing the significant characters for the campaign.

Players take turns reading question cards containing campaign slogans, political promises, and awkward statements.  The candidates submit one of the hundreds of crazy answer cards to fill in the blank. The combinations are read out loud and the reader votes for their favorite. The candidate that gains the most votes by the end of the game wins and is moving into a plush crib on Pennsylvania Avenue. Just like in real presidential campaigns you will make plenty of horrible promises and terrible statements, but in Bad Campaign the more ridiculous you are, the better your chances for getting elected.  The game pulls content from real quotes and situations.  Combined with our offbeat answer cards you will be laughing with your friends at the fat cats in Washington in no time.<br/><br/><br/>     90 Fill-in-the-blank Question Cards- Containing Real Quotes, Awkward Statements, and Questionable Campaign Promises<br/><br/><br/><br/>     450 Crazy Answer Cards- Creating Millions of Ridiculous Combinations<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Bi-partisan fun.

You&rsquo;ll need to make use not only of your own hyper-competence but also that of your teammates by way of shared mental and emotional consciousness: the Headspace. Using this technology, you can connect to your teammates' minds and use their skills as though they were your own. There's a catch though: Everyone's got emotional baggage and digging too deeply can pull a teammates emotions into your own actions. The Headspace is the edge you need to stand against the corruption of the world, are you and your fellow operatives ready to take up the challenge and make the world a better place?<br/><br/>",

You are one of those optimistic explorers.  Are you prepared to risk your life for diamonds the size of a wild boar?  Along the way you will encounter monsters, battle other heroes, and recover some priceless gems.  Be careful though, the more noise you make, the more you will attract the deadly denizens of MiniSkull Caverns.  Before you can escape with your spoils you must battle the affectionately, though unsuitably, named Tiny.  Dragons don&rsquo;t like it when you try to burgle their baubles.<br/><br/>Object: The object of MiniSkull Caverns is to guide your hero through the maze of caverns, managing your strength, and battling monsters  and other heroes, all while searching for priceless Gems.  Once you have acquired two of these Gems you must return to the center space on the map and battle Tiny in order to escape.<br/><br/>2 Player Variant: When playing with two players you must defeat Tiny and escape with three gems instead of two.<br/><br/>Solo Variant: Collect all four gems and escape before time runs out.<br/><br/>Mechanics: The mechanics use a combination of action selection using a rotating action card and player selection control card, similar to what is in Empire Engine, along with straight up dice combat against monsters and PvP dice combat with strategic modifiers the players <br/>choose.<br/><br/>"

Kids grow up to be teenagers<br/>    6. Kids leave home, the nest is empty<br/>    7. Getting old<br/>    8. Approaching this life&rsquo;s end<br/><br/>The game is played on a five by five tile 'city' - with 13 fixed tiles (representing CBD, four inner suburbs, four outer suburbs and four corner 'holiday home' locations) and 12 Modifiable (Mod) tiles which represent different landmarks (for example restaurant, art gallery, rubbish dump etc).<br/><br/>Each Mod tile has a scoring value each turn, which can change depending on the turn (phase of life) you are in. For example living near a retirement home scores well in later rounds.<br/><br/>You start the game with a house in an inner suburb. Players draft a hand of 'mod' tiles which allow them to modify the landmarks on the board (for example turn a park into a 'fancy' park, which scores more highly) - they also receive one temporary closure tile (means a tile is not scored for the current round) and one demolition tile (which permanently removes a Mod tile and replaces it with one from the side of the board).<br/><br/>Your objective is to optimise where you live in relation to your particular stage in life, and this is scored at the end of each turn.<br/><br/>Each turn you either:<br/>1. Move house<br/>2. Buy a holiday home (allowing you to place a second home on a corner of the board and then score the adjacent tiles each turn) - you may only perform this action once per game, or<br/>3. Modify a Mod tile<br/><br/>You cannot pass in Living.<br/><br/>Each turn you then score the tiles orthogonally adjacent to your home and your holiday home (if you have one).<br/><br/>At the end of the eighth turn, the highest score wins the game!<br/><br/>"

        "description": "A Hex-Grid Based Combat System for Fudge<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/><br/>This document attempts to bring a tactical combat system which may be used with miniatures and a hex grid to Fudge.<br/><br/>Some may object that this is counter to the very nature of Fudge. It is a rules light system, after all, and all the &quot;crunch&quot; and &quot;roll-playing&quot; that comes with a map-board tactical combat system are not in keeping with the spirit of the rules. I disagree. Some people are visual enough that it is much easier to &quot;get in to&quot; the combat if they visualize what is where (and, importantly, so that all present visualize something consistent). Miniatures are a great aid to this.<br/><br/>"

Many GMs running games in pseudo-medieval European settings will find this system adequate for their uses with little modification.<br/><br/>The world this system is designed for is similar to a mythical medieval Europe. The typical sorcerer sees magic as a scientific force to be manipulated through scientific (to him) means. He divides the world into four basic realms - solids, liquids, gases, and energy - which he calls earth, water, air, and fire. All things are made up of one or more of these elements. (A man's flesh is made of earth, his blood of water, his breath of air, and his spirit of fire.) He divides living things into three different realms as well - body, mind, and spirit. This world-view governs the way a sorcerer approaches magic.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>Note the original version of this system was published in A Magical Medley (Fudge).<br/><br/>"

They travel on their powerful motorcycles, sometimes alone, sometimes in small groups. Bikers ride from the ruins of one town to the next, searching for fuel and spare parts so that they can ride on to the next town and search for fuel and spare parts. Bikers value their freedom (to ride from town to town...) and their bikes above all else. They hate the gangers, who threaten their freedom and pity the 'peds' ( pedestrians - poor sods without wheels).

The original plan was to keep the technology level on the New World similar to that of the Gren who were transplanted to the innocent world from their own doomed planet. Their civilization was much like that of Earth's &quot;Old West&quot;. It was during the Black Hole Rush of 2079 that the Terrans learned once again that things do not always go as planned. Despite the Space Troopers, U.N.I.T.E. Cavalry, and Tech Rangers efforts to keep technology off the planet. There are Company Men, Serials and a host of other Tech Offenders making their job difficult. That is not to say that life is any easier for the other alien races on Tarrath like the Chireet Kireen, H'sharr, Purrians and Worvits who are all trying to survive this time of expansion and politics. It is definitely a wilder west on some very Strange Frontiers.<br/><br/>Strange Frontiers is a complete role-playing game for two or more players. The game features a new and unique combat and magic system that allows 5 different wound effects for every attack and 11 different effects for each spell cast. There are 11 races, 13 professions, 183 skills, and 144 spells to choose from. So saddle up and grab the reins, it's gonna' be a great adventure.<br/><br/>"

Command your armies, send out troops, utilize heroes, sorcerers and more to eliminate opposing armies and leave your mark in history with the War of the Races.<br/><br/>Each race is sold as a separate deck of cards, each with unique abilities and advantages. Players send out infantry to attack opposing armies or the King, who start with 50 and 5 health, respectively. The infantry consist of soldiers, archers, rogues, guards and fighters. These cards can be enhanced with special spells. In addition, a guard can be used to prevent that card from being easily defended against. Next, players send out their sorcerers, who utilize water, earth and fire spells to attack the opposing armies. Other players must counter with other sorcerers, creating a simple but effective 'rock, paper, scissors' effect! Lastly, heroes are sent the field, each with unique abilities, such as healing the army, reflecting any opposing attack back to the dealer, calling for reinforcements and more. Strategy cards are also used to take opposing soldiers as enemies, revive your King, and more.<br/><br/>The last army to remain wins the War of the Races!<br/><br/>"

Hand a force chart to each player. Gather pens or pencils so<br/>each player has something to write with.<br/>Each player chooses a number between 2 and 6; write the number you chose in the box next to the word Defiance on the right side of the force chart.<br/>Put the number 2 in the top box under the letter C found in the center of the force chart.<br/>Gather drinks and snacks because you will be expending a lot of energy.<br/>The oldest player (or the one who claims to be so, uncontested) goes first.<br/>On the left side of the force chart is energy. It's split into five sets of 100 energy (5 per box; 25 per row).<br/>Energy helps decides the length of each game. At the beginning before any player takes a turn. The group may cross out any sets of energy (beginning at the bottom) to reduce the overall game.<br/><br/>Starting The Game<br/>Each player begins with two dice. On your turn roll the two dice adding them for your total. As long as you didn't roll any ones you may continue to roll adding the two dice values to the last total. (This represents concentrating to build more power)You may stop at any time or if you roll any ones you must stop.<br/>If you roll identical numbers on any dice roll you gain a bonus to your total value by multiplying your total value (after adding this roll to it) by the number of identical numbers rolled.<br/>If all the numbers are the same on all the dice you rolled, you gain an additional dice. (So if you rolled two dice and both displayed a two. You would immediately gain another dice so from then on you get to roll three dice. If when rolling three dice, all three display a two, you gain another dice, immediately, so now you are rolling four dice. )<br/>When you stop rolling (concentrating) your total value is rounded to the closest five. Choose an opponent to blast. It's subtracted from the Energy on their force chart. Each box is worth five points so if you blast someone for 25 points they must cross out 5 boxes.<br/>Rolling ones represents losing your concentration. All points you accumulated this turn are lost and you take 5 points damage per 1 displayed on your dice in backlash, (if you rolled two 1's you would have to cross out 2 boxes). <br/>Backlash damage can not be defied.<br/><br/>Winning And Losing The Game<br/>To win you must be the only remaining player or you can share a win by calling a truce. <br/>Losing a game is to be reduced to zero energy or less than two dice.<br/><br/>Energy<br/>Your energy is displayed on the left of your force chart. It represents your life's energy. When all boxes are crossed out, you die! (lose). It's divided into sections. Each section has 100 health; four rows of five boxes, each worth 5 points. When all the boxes in one section are crossed off you lose one die to your rolls (if you have been rolling three dice on your turn, you would now be reduced to rolling only two).<br/><br/>Defiance<br/>Defiance is found on the right side of the force chart. At the beginning of each game you choose a number between 2 and 6. Every time this number is rolled you gain a defiance point which is marked by filling in a box in the defiance section. For each row you have filled you may cancel five points (one box) of damage from an opponent. Once you use it you must cross it out, each row can only be used once.<br/><br/>Concentration<br/>This represents your level of concentration by the number of dice you get to roll on your turn. It is found in the middle of the force chart. In the top box write the number 2 because everyone begins with two dice. Whenever the dice amount changes, mark it here.<br/>(Everyone begins with 2 dice. If you you gain another dice then in the box below the 2 write 3 as the new number of dice you can use on each of your turns.)<br/><br/>Trinity!<br/>Whenever you roll three of a kind (except ones) you may yell TRINITY! Thereby gaining its benefit.<br/>If you choose to yell Trinity, you must stop rolling and add this final roll to your total. Multiply it by the number of like dice (in this case at least three). Now you may split your attack between up to three opponents instead of just one. Plus any damage from a Trinity can not be defied. (Trinity is the all powerful truth; undeniable in its consuming power!)<br/><br/>Unholy Trinity!<br/>Whenever you roll three ones... ouch. You lose three times the amount of backlash<br/><br/>"

The word &quot;SCIENCE!&quot; makes you think of rugged men of adventure satisfying their curiosity and pushing civilization forward into the future. Or, at least, it does if you live in a parallel world where science isn't a thing geeks do. This may explain why so many real, geeky scientists turn to a life of costumed crime: the frustration of living up to an image far grander and glorious than they could ever be.<br/>...<br/>SuperScience has always lurked in the shadows, but the first dramatic displays of SuperScience were during World War II, when Nazi SuperScientist Wilhelm von Frankenstein, grandson of the original &quot;mad scientist&quot;, rebuilt ancient flying saucers from the hollow earth and bred mutant superstormtroopers to pilot them. Fortunately, Germany wasn't the only nation with SuperScience; Professor Bernard Quartermass, who later headed Great Britain's space program, gathered together select Allied SuperScientists to turn back the Frankenstein threat.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>In addition to the core rules document, a specialized character sheet and organization sheet are available for download.<br/><br/>"

In this case an 18, which gains the group access to another room, until they are able to escape all five rooms and finally exit the mansion to the freedom without.<br/><br/>Starting The Game<br/>If Jane is present at this game, she always goes first, otherwise the oldest player starts and the turns continue clockwise.<br/>Jane (or the oldest player) rolls the dice adding them together, she records the final number in the first box of her score-pad. (Example: 5, 5, 3 = 13 in the box.)<br/>The goal is to reach the number 18 but without going over. To gain access to the next room the exact value of 18 must be attained. Since on the first roll an 18 can only be gained by rolling triple sixes most players will just write their total on the score-pad and the turn goes to the next player (clock-wise).<br/><br/>Each player in turn does the same.<br/><br/>In the event a triple six is rolled; when achieving an 18 all players move forward one room. Additionally any player who rolls a triple number can move to the next room (alone). The player who rolls triple sixes gets to move once with the group and once alone (two room advancement).<br/><br/>The Zombie<br/>Whenever someone rolls ones (one, two or three ones), the zombie is advanced on the track. The roll of one or two ones, the zombie moves forward once but if triple ones are rolled the zombie moves forward twice.<br/>The player continues their turn even when the zombie moves forward and the player finishes the turn before the zombie moves.<br/><br/>The track has the numbers 3, 2, and 1. Depending on the difficulty is where the zombie begins. 3 is the easiest because it takes longer for the zombie to travel across the track from 3 to 2 then to 1, before appearing in the attic of the mansion.<br/><br/>When the zombie is in the same room with any of the players, if ones are rolled, the zombie eats the flesh of the player with the lowest value on their score-pad (use one die to determine who is lowest when there is a tie).  <br/>It take a few rounds for the zombie to consume its victim before the allure of new flesh draws it off its current meal. This time is represented by returning the zombie back to his starting position.<br/><br/>Having your flesh gnawed by the zombie causes you to lose the game.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>In 2285 AUship held a series of meetings with several large Australian resource companies operating large holdings both in Earth system and other interstellar locations. As the meetings progressed a specialized design began to evolve that would eventually become the Broken Hill-class prospector. Construction of a prototype commenced in July 2287 and by the middle of 2288, the five hundredth anniversary year of the settlement of Australia, orders were placed by all four participant companies. This entailed an order of sixteen ships with options for additional hulls should the design prove itself in service.<br/><br/>The prospector allows for up to four mining cutters to dock and transfer mined ore to the two ore holds. There are two cargo locks on either side of the access and docking spine that directly deliver ore to a hold via a dump chute. The prospector can only carry two mining cutters externally but the added flexibility of allowing two more cutters to simultaneously dock to transfer ore during mining operations is a definite bonus.<br/><br/>Ships of Clement Sector 12: Broken Hill-class Prospector comes complete with beautiful views of the ship.  The prospector is presented with full deckplans and statistics to make your use of our product simple, easy and fun. In addition, the ship comes with a set of adventure hooks to get your characters right into the action as well as a short story written by Bradley Warnes.<br/><br/>In addition, Ships of Clement Sector 12: Broken Hill-class Prospector also includes the Venture-class Troop Transport.  A variation of the Broken Hill-class prospector, the Venture-class troop transport is marketed as an affordable transport vessel for small system defense forces and private security contractors (mercenaries). The distributed hull design and large small craft carrying capacity of the Broken Hill allows for relatively inexpensive conversion into a light military transport.<br/><br/>"

She is now blind to the future, and her kingdom trembles in fear at what is to come.<br/><br/>Those that wear the bronze masks of Tzanti sing now in praise to their lord, preparing a dark ritual that will bring forth the God's messenger from beyond. Unless her dreams are returned, the Seeress will descend into madness, and her people along with her.<br/><br/>In the land of Nubara, the people live and die by the prophecies of their chosen Seeress Deja, the holy servant of the Sun God. For many years, tensions had been growing between the Kingdom of Nubara and the Sand-Princes of Shen. The Seeress saw only blood and fire in a future of war, and worked hard to keep her King and her people on the path of peace and reason. Yet there were those who desired the chaos of war to visit Nubara.<br/><br/>These were not the Sand-Princes. It was the Cult of Tzanti, the Demon Prince of Fungus and Blight, who watched from afar and plotted Nubara's destruction. These men lived in the desert wastes of Kesh, the Land of Exiles. Long had they hated those that prospered in the Sun's light, and they saw an opportunity in the possibility of war.<br/><br/>The Masks of Tzanti is a setting-neutral Pathfinder adventure for 5th level heroes set in a primal, raw land. Come to the rescue of the Seeress and save Nubara from war! This Menagerie Press adventure includes six pre-made heroes so that players can leap straight into action.<br/><br/>"

All too often most of that lifetime gets squandered. We come to realize the importance of our legacy only when it is almost too late.<br/><br/>They are the most desirable and seductive women in the city, the women of the night. Men are willing to travel into the most disreputable of neighbourhoods to meet them, offer money and gifts for but a few hours of their time or even less. They ply the oldest profession, selling their bodies into others&rsquo; fantasies.<br/><br/>But for the streetwalkers of the red-light district known as the Kaz, death takes its time. The disease known as the Pale stakes its claim by transforming its victims into visions of beauty, alabaster skin and elegantly thin. But beware, for death is a jealous lover, who lays claim to any who might make love to those already ill, and so they become known as the Terribly Beautiful. Shunned by society, they find each other and face the remaining days of their lives.<br/><br/>"

Resources may be replenished at starbases.<br/><br/>A depiction of the known quadrants is at the top of the text screen, with three-digit numbers indicating the number of Klingons, the number of starbases and the number of stars respectively. Navigating to a different quadrant reveals the adjacent quadrants. A depiction of the quadrant in which the Enterprise is present is in the lower left.<br/><br/>Absolute position is given as ordered pairs: vertical, from the top; and horizontal, from the left. Angle notation is navigation style: 0 degrees at the top, counting clockwise.<br/><br/>Two unusual features the game had, for text-based Star Trek games, were that when torpedoes were fired the player would see them travel, and also that the Klingons had torpedoes (in these early games, they were usually armed only with disruptors).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Apple Trek&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"

Tired of being expected to leap at the chance to solve everyone&rsquo;s petty problems? Have a thing for twirling mustaches and overly-elaborate deathtraps? Why not mix things up with a villainous character! At some point in their gaming career, everyone has considered playing an &ldquo;evil campaign,&rdquo; but with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game being devoted to goody-two-shoes heroes, it can sometimes be hard to find support. Want some evil options for your character? You&rsquo;ve found them!<br/><br/>This book presents five new villainous archetypes for five different classes. Included are the bloodboiler, a bloodrager archetypes whose rage is infectious, inciting allies and enemies both into a frenzied riot, the maligner, a druid archetype that specializes in turning animals and plants against civilization, and transforming them into more dangerous creatures, the zealous hound, an inquisitor archetype that denounces his foes to weaken them in combat, and specializes in dragging confessions from heretics and other sinners, the bokor, an occultist archetype that can exploit the connection between objects and their owners to enact powerful magic in the style of voodoo dolls, and the obsessive murderer, a stalker archetype that focuses on building a connection between himself and his prey to deliver truly devastating attacks.<br/><br/>Whether you're about to embark on a politically-themed campaign (such as Way of the Wicked, by Fire Mountain Games, or the first official Paizo adventure path made specifically for evil characters), or you just want an excuse to play an unrepentant, irredeemable villain, this book has lots of tantalizing options to offer. Even GMs can get in on the fun, as several of the archetypes here are perfect for villainous NPCs as well, and can make for exciting and memorable encounters.<br/><br/>"

These have a Score ranging from 1-3, assigned from a points pool at creation.  Characters also may select up to three Aspects (Traits) which are narrative tags or descriptions.<br/><br/>Difficult or opposed actions use a unique system for resolution.  An eight-point &quot;compass card&quot; is used, and the game master selects a point (which varies with each use).  The player then attempts to guess the point.  The player may select one point for each Score in their relative Core Ability.  Action difficulty yields a &quot;spread&quot; of points from which the guessed number may vary from the selected number and still yield success.<br/><br/>The setting is not well developed but in general has a action/adventure/swashbuckling feel to it.  The setting would not be usable in a campaign without significant development.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "In Death Pit Duels, you and your rival assemble a team of fantasy warriors who then duel in a series of one-on-one matches. Win the duel and take the spoils; lose and...well, it's not called a death pit for nothing! When the dust settles, who will be declared the victor?<br/><br/>The game is divided into two phases: Draft and Duel. In the Draft phase, players take turns splitting up randomly drawn fantasy fighter cards of various races (Cyclops, Goblin, Human, Orc) into two pairs. Their opponent then gets to select which pair to take. The player who originally split the cards into pairs must take the remaining pair of fighters that was unselected by their opponent. This continues until both players have built a team of twelve fighters.<br/><br/>The game then moves on to the Duel phase in which the players fight for a randomly drawn coin by revealing one of the fighter cards that they drafted. Each fighter has a base combat value and may also have a special ability to help them in the duel. The players simultaneously select a Duel card from their hand and reveal at the same time, adding the value of the Duel card to their fighter's combat value. The fighter with the highest adjusted combat value wins the coin. The game continues in this way until all twelve of a player's fighters have fought one duel each. The player with the highest total value in coins wins.<br/><br/>"

The game consists of music predominantly from the rock music, rock and roll and J-pop genres. It is considered one of the most influential video games of all time, for having laid the foundations for popular guitar-based rhythm games, such as the Guitar Hero series. Working Designs attempted to bring Guitar Freaks PlayStation 2 games in the U.S., but patent problems with the guitar controller prevented the project from moving forward.<br/><br/>The game's nineteenth version, GuitarFreaks V8, was released in March 28, 2011. It was speculated to be the final release of GuitarFreaks V.<br/>A spin-off series, GuitarFreaks XG was released in Japanese arcades on March 10, 2010, which added two more buttons to the fret bar.<br/>A sequel, GuitarFreaks XG2, was released on March 9, 2011.

This struggle has been depicted in numerous conflict simulation games; it is certainly one of the most fascinating subjects in the wargame hobby. One-Minute Little Bighorn is a microgame attempting to portray the battle with a small map and a limited number of counters.<br/><br/>One-Minute Little Bighorn is a solitaire challenge. The entire battle only takes about 60 seconds to play. However, the game offers a player most of the tactical choices available to Custer in 1876.<br/><br/>The player represents the commander of the 7th Cavalry and army units represent battalions containing several companies. Tribal warriors like Crazy Horse are included in the groups of Native American fighting men swarming out of the village to block the advance of the cavalry. Historical factors like the escape of tribal noncombatants, the arrival of Benteen, and rallying defeated cavalry formations are contained in the rules. Victory is determined by the level of success achieved by Custer... if he survives the battle.<br/><br/>This companion game to the previously released One-Minute Waterloo is a free Print &amp; Play game with a single 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; map, charts, rules, and two dozen playing pieces or markers.<br/><br/>"

Players compete to kill monsters and take their blood.<br/><br/>In general, Bloodborne is a game about risk management with a bit of group think, inventory management/upgrades, and tactical play. You start with a hand of basic weapons, which you get to upgrade to improve your fighting combos and capabilities.<br/><br/>Each turn, one monster chosen at random attacks players, who fight back as a team, with everyone playing a card from their hand simultaneously to attempt to kill the monster. Players collect blood from the monster, assuming it dies, based on how much damage they dealt. Monsters can fight back with exploding dice that can potentially deal infinite damage.<br/><br/>Players can fight as long as they want, but if they die in combat, they lose their progress. Players can opt out of fighting to bank their blood and save it permanently. Collected blood counts as victory points.<br/><br/>Says designer Eric M. Lang, &quot;My goal with Bloodborne was to channel the intensity and frustration of the video game into a contest between players. Lots of death.&quot;<br/><br/>"

To do this, you must outsmart your rivals by being a clever investor, bidding on the right city tiles, and creating your own little district of Naples.<br/><br/>Over the course of five game rounds, players first have to plan their actions carefully, choosing whether they want to invest in new pizzerias, make express deliveries, get sponsored by the bank, or decide to expand their district. Once all players have used up their action tokens, players get rewarded by receiving Lira, which they can then use in a bidding phase to determine how many deliveries you can make, and how many pizzas you can deliver. Once you deliver pizzas to your hungry customers, they reward you by boosting your abilities, making each action more powerful as the game progresses. Every decision counts, but Pap&agrave; Paolo is a very accessible game, which will charm players of all ages alike.<br/><br/>",

On each turn the player chooses a card from the center, reveals it to everyone, and then decides to either keep it and put it on the right end of the wall or put it back face-down. The end of the game is triggered when a player puts a 10th card. The player with the wall with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>"

The queen and her kingdom are often thought of in the same regard; the kingdom didn&rsquo;t truly come into being until her birth, blossomed in her youth, and wilted away as the queen aged and succumbed to madness. Of course, this is in the annals of history now, as Queen Niva died decades ago, crazed and alone in her mountain keep&hellip; right?<br/><br/>Not according to a new cult calling itself The Queen&rsquo;s Adherents. This group not only claims that Queen Niva is alive and well, but she has regained her youth and former beauty. What&rsquo;s more, they promise any that join their ranks may receive their queen&rsquo;s blessing and become immortal themselves! The PCs are ultimately the ones that need to dissolve the cult from growing, and in doing so look into the mystery behind the queen&rsquo;s enigmatic return. But be careful, because if looks could kill, this mission could be murder!<br/><br/>"

Players search for the bomb and the wire cutters amongst nine face down cards. Each card has a special ability: allowing a second card to be seen (wire cutters, sniffer dog, metal detector), mixing the cards around (anarchist, panic), or just reacting to other cards (bomb, rat, can). On their turn, a player secretly looks at a card and declares it to the others. If they are not accused of lying, or if accused and acquitted, they get to perform the declared action. Certain combinations make the bomb explode, and if not defused the bomb explodes after six turns regardless. Bomb Squad #9 was derived as a combination and miniaturisation of Lost Legacy and Memory, but with a metal detector that actually beeps!<br/><br/>"

To achieve this, the player has to create bridges, which are strong enough.<br/>    <br/>Destroy target: In this level, the player has to invent efficient weapons (for example cannons) to destroy structures.<br/><br/>Multiplayer<br/><br/>The multiplayer part of the game is more strategy oriented and contains different game types. In all of the game types, the players have areas in which they can build things on the opposite side of the map. In order to be able to build things, you have to create producers, which produce resources. Furthermore, you have to create warehouses to store resources. All strategic blocks, including producers and warehouses consist of a podium and an object, which lies on it. If this object falls off the podium, the object loses all upgrades. Therefore, you have to build defences in order to defend you production system. Currently the game contains two multiplayer modes, which have different goals:<br/><br/><br/>Defend the crown: In this mode, the player has to defend a crown, which lies on a podium. Like described above, the player has to gain resources in order to build defences and weapons and to unlock more powerful blocks like the TNT-block or the accelerator-block.<br/>    <br/>Tower construction: In this mode, each player has to create a high enough tower. The first player, who builds such a tower and defends it for 2 minutes against attacks from the other player, wins the game.<br/><br/>Sandbox<br/><br/>In the sandbox mode you can build everything you want without limits. Sandbox maps can be saved so you don't have to worry to lose anything you've created. Currently, there is also a multiplayer sandbox in development in order to enable you to build and experiment with your friends.<br/><br/>Inventor mode<br/><br/>Since everything is created out of blocks, it might take long to build things that are more complex. The Inventor-mode enables you to create your own inventions out of bricks, which you can save and then place in singleplayer-, multiplayer- and sandbox-games like any other block. Invent a new machine, more efficient weapons or powerful defences - the better your ideas, the better are your chances of winning a multiplayer game or mastering a challenge in a singleplayer game.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>Intelligent insect societies have inherited the earth following the extinction of humanity. Characters are man-sized social insects &ndash; ants, termites, wasps, or bees &ndash; reacting to, exploring the relics of, and misinterpreting their human predecessors. Since the bugs are newly sentient they don&rsquo;t have any sense of history. They don&rsquo;t remember that humans viewed insects as inconsequential - when they weren&rsquo;t exterminating them as pests.<br/><br/>The game&rsquo;s title is from an anecdote about the biologist J.B.S. Haldane, who, when asked what one could infer about the creator from studying nature, is reported to have replied: &quot;an inordinate fondness for beetles.&quot; The phrase also stands in for the insects&rsquo; romanticization of humankind.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "Based on Filipe Melo, Juan Cavia and Santiago Villa`s IP, &ldquo;The Adventures of Dog Mendon&ccedil;a &amp; Pizza Boy&rdquo;,  was conceived as a complex universe, full of compelling stories and attractive characters. To broaden the experience we have created several entertainment properties, with an independent life, that will work as multiple entry points into this universe. Each of these products will develop diﬀerent aspects of the plot and different time frames for the viewer to unravel all the mysteries surrounding the Dog Mendon&ccedil;a Universe across an array of Medias:<br/>&ndash; A series of Published COMIC BOOKS: volumes have been published in Portugal by Tinta Da China and by Dark Horse Comics in the US and the UK while a new volume is in the works.<br/>&ndash; A series of VIDEOGAMES (in production): set as a series of episodical point-and-click adventure games that will deal with a new case in each installment. The mysteries usually go deeper than what the group expects, forcing them to work their full potential and, from time to time, to save the world. Not a big deal, when it comes to them. The first game will start with a new plot but not as a sequel to the books. The characters will be introduced in a fun way -as in the old Sam &amp; Max games- and then, if the user reads the comics, he&rsquo;ll pick up some jokes or references to those stories; but they won&rsquo;t affect the game&rsquo;s experience. Supported platforms: Mobile (IOS/Android), PC (Mac/Windows/Linux) and Consoles (PS3, Vita).<br/>-TV(in development): With a lot of comedy, action and adventure we&rsquo;ll get to know Dog and his team while travelling the world to whatever place they are hired to solve a new case. In each episode Eurico, as the new intern of the company, will learn how Dog and Pazuul solved a similar case in the past, and then try to face the danger himself.<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "Yggdrasill A game for 2 players set up in Nordic setting and based on Nordic mythology, where one side (good gods of Asgard and vikings) try to eliminate the bad guys (evil gods and monsters) by defeating a giant snake Jormungard living in the crown of the Yggdrasill tree.<br/><br/>In the beginning, the good side can play only with 12 vikings, who are not too powerful. Their task is to send the message to the gods of Asgard to ask them for help in the war with evil forces. They can do it by either building the ships and sailing to Asgard, or by killing one of evil monsters (Trwyth), after which, they will be allowed to go through the stone forest and reach Asgard. Evil side, of course, tries to prevent it from happening, but with slick tactics, vikings are able to achieve it. And this is when the real fun begins. With the help of almost 20 gods, the good side begins an even battle.<br/><br/>The evil gods and monsters try to chase and eliminate the good gods and vikings, to prevent them from reaching Yggdrasill. the tree on which Jormungard the snake lives. If the good manage to kill it,they win. If the evil, eliminate all good ones, they win.<br/> Every character in the game has 2 traits: strength and magic power + some of them, are able to use spells. Duels are, unfortunately simple, you choose either strength or magic, roll a die and add the result to the chosen trait. The higher result denotes the winner. After the 1st wounded the character's token is flipped and remains wounded until healed (successful die roll)or attacked and wounded again, which is the end for a given character.<br/><br/>The game is played on a huge board, divided into lands. There are seas, rivers, mountains, forests and places to explore, where magic items can be found. Characters can also learn spells in magic schools.<br/><br/>There are also event cards, drawn at the beginning of a new round.<br/>The game, though simple, and rather visually not too attractive, is a lot of fun to play. Because of the size of the board and numerous charters, it is never played the same way. The good may have many possible routes to get to Yggdrasill, and the abilities (spells) of some of their mightiest gods, can change a hopeless situation.<br/>If one changed the rules of battling, made a new colorful board and substitute cardboard tokens with plastic figures, the game would be a hit.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "Heretik is a chess variant in which cards are used to improve abilities and undermine opponents. Unlike other chess card games, Heretik makes chess more elaborate without sacrificing the strategic elements of regular chess.<br/><br/>Heretik begins like regular chess, but players draw a card after each move. These cards may be played, declared, or discarded to move in new ways, move multiple pieces at once, or even push your enemies off the edge of the board.<br/><br/>There are sixty unique cards available to download from the website. Playing Heretik requires two copies of each card and a regular chess set. You may also need extra pieces and pawns (or tokens to represent them), and a couple of small rocks that can be placed on the squares.<br/><br/>"
