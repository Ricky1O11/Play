The basic game comes with a 140 page rulebook, reference sheets, unit recruitment cards, 4 hex maps, and card stock counters representing a small orc and human (Empire) army.  The maps are generic terrain maps with light woods and small hills.  They may be combined in different ways to create different battlefields.  If you enjoy the game you can invest more money in it by purchasing the different 15mm regiment packs.  The game supports several races typical of the fantasy genre (elves, dwarves, orcs, dark elves) and adds a few unique ones as well (Thain[Norse], Isthak [chaos-like]).  The regiments generally consist of 8 to 10 counters.<br/><br/>Gameplay:  Players are free to set their objectives for each battle, though some simple scenarios are provided to get you started.  Players spend points to add regiments for their armies.  Armies are set up on the edge of the mapboard and maneuvered to contact.  Orders are selected for each unit for each turn indicating whether it will skirmish (move and fire), attack (move to contact), move (move long distance), or hold (defend and fire at incoming attackers if missile equipped).  Use of ordered formations help a unit fight and move.  Combat bonuses are given to units who are able to hit their target in the flank or rear, use terrain to advantage, and use weapons that confer advantage in special cases (ie lance from a charging knight).  Morale rules determine whether a unit is going to hold their position, rout, or in some cases become 'impetuous' and aggressively continue an attack without orders to do so.<br/><br/>As a player you assume the role of General of an army.   <br/>The game begins by recruiting an army. Each army is made up of several units. A unit is a group of soldiers who fight together in an organized fashion. Most units have 40 foot troops or 20 mounted models on ten individual hex bases. Sometimes a unit might be a single large creature like a dragon or war machine such as a catapult. Every unit has a points value and when you create an Army, both players will have an agreed upon amount of points to spend to create their army. This is most often 1200 points, the amount used for tournament play. For your army you may also want to recruit special heroes, commanders or wizards. Every unit in the Demonworld game has its own recruiting card which is included in the army book. These handy little cards make recruiting an army easy because they include all the information about a unit including its points cost.<br/><br/>Once both players have spent all their points and created their army, it is time to create the battlefield. Demonworld is played on a large flat surface like a table. This could be a kitchen, dining room, or work table or even the floor. The Demonworld game is great because the battlefield consists of four or more of the Demonworld maps. You can also augment the maps with model trees, buildings or hills. This is not really necessary however, because the maps look great. Using the maps makes setting up a game really fast. Four of these maps are provided with the basic game. If you would like more variety several additional map sets are available.<br/><br/>Once the maps are laid out each player will deploy their units on the battlefield. Where you place your units is crucial to the success of your army. Try to take advantage of the terrain. This could mean creating an ambush by hiding a unit in the woods. Or putting a unit on a hill where your opponent will have to fight uphill to attack them. If you can, also try to imagine what your opponent will do and then you may be able to set a trap for them or otherwise create a plan to defeat them.<br/><br/>Once both armies are deployed (put on the table) play begins. Demonworld uses a simultaneous turn sequence. In each turn both players will have an opportunity to move all of their units and shoot missile weapons like bows, engage in hand to hand combat, or cast spells. The rules on how to perform these actions are in the Demonworld rule book. The army books have extra rules for special units which only that army may recruit and special spells which only that army can cast. As the turns progress each player will try to move their units to a position of advantage and eliminate the opponents units. Sometimes people play a game with a specific set of objectives. These games are called scenarios. In scenarios achieving your objectives is often more important than destroying your opponents army or preventing your own losses. Once one side has achieved its objectives or destroyed the opposing army, they are the winner and the game is over. Most games take about three hours. Experienced players play much faster than novices and can handle larger armies.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "3220": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1325": {"name": "Andrej Wiatkin"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Lost World", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2027": "Storytelling"}, "yearpublished": "1994", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic8302_t.jpg", "average": "5.25", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3320": {"name": "(Unknown)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic8302.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"204896": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1093": {"name": "Novel-based"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&rsquo;s novel.<br/><br/>"}, "3221": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1325": {"name": "Andrej Wiatkin"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Nieznaika on the Moon", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2027": "Storytelling"}, "yearpublished": "1994", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}, "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic8294_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3320": {"name": "(Unknown)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic8294.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"204897": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Based on the novel by Nikolai Nosov and on cartoon TV-series.<br/><br/>"}, "3222": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1325": {"name": "Andrej Wiatkin"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Wizard of Oz's Emerald Town", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "yearpublished": "1998", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic8316_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"740": {"name": "Centre of Prospective Projects"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic8316.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"204898": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1010": {"name": "Fantasy"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Based on the novels by Frank Baum and Alexander Volkov<br/><br/>"}, "3223": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic302712.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"9752": {"name": "Jacques Thiriat"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1986", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamepublisher": {"41": {"name": "Descartes Editeur"}}, "maxplaytime": "180", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic302712_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": {"1039": {"name": "Deduction"}}, "description": "&quot;As the events unfold, day by day, can you clear Anny Forster of the charges against her?

Work with the other players to create a mighty home for the Chieftain, stone by stone. You are a craftsman, but you cannot let the Chieftain see your trademark stones, or you will be penalized. The longer you play, the more difficult this task becomes! Take on your opponents and become the Chieftain's Master Builder.<br/><br/>The theme setting is the Native American Pueblos of the Southwest tribes of the Zuni and Hopi. The board is a fairly small square. Each player gets a number of building blocks in their own color, and also some neutral colored blocks (1 fewer than the colored). Starting with the odd colored block, the player places it on the board, and then gets to move the &quot;Chieftain&quot;  around the outer track surrounding the board. If the Chieftain can look straight across and see any colored blocks, those players gain points -- but points are bad. And when the Chieftain lands on the corners of the track, he looks down on the Pueblo from above, and all visible player's blocks gain them more points. Now, on each subsequent pair of turns, you have a choice of a colored block and a neutral block. Once all players' blocks are played, the Chieftain makes one last trip around the board, players gaining points all along the way. The player who has gained the fewest number of points is the Master Builder and the winner of the game.<br/><br/>There are also some extra components for making the game more challenging by adding an element of bidding for turn order, and from 1 to 4 sacred sites that cannot be built upon.<br/><br/>Original description from box.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"24660": "German first edition"}, "average": "6.88383", "name": "Pueblo", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2043": "Area Enclosure"}, "age": "10", "usersrated": "2070", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5607": "3D Games"}}, "3229": {"boardgamedesigner": {"839": {"name": "Marco Donadoni"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Il gioco dei Medici", "playingtime": "240", "minplayers": "4", "yearpublished": "1982", "usersrated": "49", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic433506_t.jpg", "average": "6.84286", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"435": {"name": "International Team"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic433506.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"155102": "International Team First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "240", "description": "Players represent the powers of the XVth century: Holy Roman Emperor, Ottoman Turk Sultan, Pope, King of Spain, King of France and the head of the famous Medici family of Florence.

The ensuing battle began their summer offensive that would take them across the Ukraine to the Dnieper River.<br/>During August the two sides were equally matched and a tremendous war of attrition raged from Kharkov to the Sea of Azov with neither side willing to give ground. In September, bled white by the never-ending Soviet attacks, the German army retreated in haste to the safety of the Dnieper River. In October, the battle raged along the length of the Dnieper and for the Perekop Peninsula, the only land exit to the German 17th Army in the Crimea. During this three month period German reinforcements poured in from every sector, but it was never enough.

The Battle of the Bulge is a card game for 2-4 players recreating the famous WWII battle in which the German Army mounted a surprise attack on the thin U.S. forces deployed in the Ardennes region, hoping to break through to the English Channel and split the Allied Forces.  Each player controls either the German or the U.S. and British forces.  Players draw cards in each daily turn from their own decks, then play the cards as they see fit.  Many cards can be played during the opponent's turn so there is constant interaction.  Each deck is complete; there are no cards to collect or trade.  NUTS! comes in two 150-card sets (North and South).  Each set is complete and can be played on its own, or the two sets can be played together.  (From the back of the box by Decision Games)<br/><br/>The cards have actual photographs of units, events, cities, and equipment from the battle.  Cards comprise of units (infantry, artillery, mechanized), events like bad weather or supply drops, and terrain to include cities, major forest, rivers, and ridges.  Units are rated in strength values for infantry, armor, artillery, and cohesion.  The objectives are for the Germans to get three panzer units (six if playing both decks) from their start side off the Allied side of the board.  The Allies must prevent this and stall the offensive until adequate reinforcement arrival.  Although this is a card game, it plays very much like a board game.  Battles are resolved via dice rolling.  The rules do include important factors such as supply, town encirclement, weather, blitzes, cohesion checks, and the like.  Overall, an easy to medium game to grasp the rules and play.

As the game progresses, competition for the explorers' services increases as each explorer has fewer expeditions available for investment. In the end, only one ship for each explorer makes the final trip and only one king earns those rewards.<br/><br/>Firstly, the board is set up from two double-sided boards, giving four possible configurations with slightly different versions of each explorer. Each player has six ships and money cards numbered 1 to 9. There are three turns. In the first, each explorer has 3 ships, but only two of these will proceed to the second turn and only one will win through to the third.<br/><br/>A set of cards with explorers is used for each turn - 3 of each explorer in turn one, 2 of each in turn two and 1 of each in the last turn. The top card is revealed and an auction held, going round the table until all but one player has passed. The winning bidder puts the card in front of them and places one of their ships on to the relevant explorer area on the board. This process is repeated until all the cards have been bid on.<br/><br/>Each explorer has a different power, some giving victory points, others money or a special ability like being able to delay a subsequent auction, or a combination of these. At the end of a turn players gain two new money cards, plus any which explorers they have a ship on give them. The second turn work in the same way, but only players with a ship invested in an explorer can bid on it, and because there are only two ships of the three on each explorer moving to the second area, one will be left behind. Similarly, the third round sees just one ship of the remaining two move to the third and final area for each explorer. Scoring is then done, with more points available for players with ships reaching the third area.<br/><br/>Money is always tight so it is a good idea to try and get some extra income, though this conflicts with the need to score points. Two of the explorers score a lot of points but have no income so each player must balance the two needs. Money cards are worth points as well, so there is also a trade off between using these to win auctions to advance your ships and keeping them to score with.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"29196": "Dutch first edition"}, "average": "6.55978", "name": "Pizarro & Co.", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "1278", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5614": "Country: Portugal"}}, "3268": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1345": {"name": "Phillippe Aucagos"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Bunker Poker", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "1999", "usersrated": "34", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic310902_t.jpg", "average": "4.92353", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"155": {"name": "Gigamic"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic310902.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"115419": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "age": "9", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Very simple luck driven game.

The cards are revealed and then resolved in order from highest to smallest, with suit order breaking ties. Each card takes all the cards of same value and same suit from the pool and then goes into the pool, so a card played never returns to the hand of the player and later cards can capture earlier cards. The cards that are left in the pool are discarded and a new pool of four cards is dealt.<br/><br/>This process is repeated as long as there are cards left in the deck, then the player who has the best five-card Poker hand wins the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"222101": "Cheapass Games 1997 Fall Catalog edition"}, "name": "Lamarckian Poker", "playingtime": "10", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "average": "6.51231", "usersrated": "78", "boardgamefamily": {"1439": "Card Games: Card Fishing"}}, "3271": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic19444.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"22": {"name": "Steve Jackson (I)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1983", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"13114": "Denis Loubet"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"19": {"name": "Steve Jackson Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic19444_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1016": {"name": "Science Fiction"}}, "description": "Pocket Box; cover art by Dave Martin. 21&quot; x 32&quot; green/brown map, four sheets of black/red/white two-sided counters, rulebook.

Each player is a (model) cat that lives in its own house. To win the game a cat must fill its larder with six items of food. There is milk at the Dairy, vitamins at the Vet, fish from the Fishmonger and a tin of cat food from the corner shop. There are also (model) birds and mice, which the cats have to catch. Of course, each cat begins the game with nine lives; any cat that loses all of its nine lives is out of the game. Players are dealt a hand of Mog cards; these and a die provide the means to move the cats, birds and mice. The players can choose to move their cats along garden walls or paths or, the more adventurous can travel round the road, this route is a lot quicker but there is a car. Cats can raid other cats larders and attack one another. A pack of Curiosity cards dictate, at random, when the shops open and close and movements of the (model) car. A Curiosity card is picked up when a cat lands on a Curiosity square.

It is primarily concerned with the military aspects of the American Revolutionary War. There is a basic game, various scenarios with advanced rules and a campaign game.<br/><br/>Avalon Hill Complexity Rating - 7<br/><br/><br/>(from the back of the box:)<br/><br/>The shot heard round the world at Lexington set off more than just another brushfire war in England's scattered dominions. It gave birth to a struggling new nation led by a comparative handful of patriots whose refusal to bow before tyranny set the tone for an American heritage preserved from defeat to this very day. But victory did not come cheap. <br/>After showing the British the color of their mettle at Bunker Hill, Washington's little army was plagued by one defeat after another, shunting from one battlefield to the next; always beaten but never destroyed. No power of the period believed that the upstart colonials and their unborn nation had the slightest chance of emerging victorious against the strongest military machine of the era after the dismal summer of 1776. But then came the cruelest winter of the decade when even nature seemed to join forces with the British against the tattered American troops. Undaunted, Washington led his small force in the historic crossing of the Delaware to twice surprise and rout British forces at Trenton and Princeton. Their resolve thus strengthened, the ill-clad Americans retired to Valley Forge to face winter beset by the hunger and deprivation that cost the lives of 2500 patriots. But the coming spring found Clinton facing a revitalized and strengthened rebel army which proceeded to chase him across New Jersey in the Monmouth Campaign. Reassured by news of the French alliance and the great American victory at Saratoga that fall, American troops dug in for what they knew would be a long and bitter battle for independence.<br/><br/>6 Games in One Package - Each a Realistic Simulation of the War for Independence...<br/><br/>1776, like all Avalon Hill games, is more than just the standard roll the dice and move game. It is a realistic simulation of the strategic situation faced by British and American alike in that fiery decade when the United States won its independence. <br/>Actually, 1776 is six games in one: a Basic Game that gets you quickly and easily into the routine of simulation gaming; an Advanced Game with scenarios that provides additional complexity and realism; and a Campaign Simulation Game that encompasses the entire war and balances successes in one region against failures in another - truly the ultimate in a simulation gaming experience! <br/>And if you don't have the time for a complete Campaign Game, there are four scenarios to choose from; each of which poses a challenge for everyone; from the most erudite of military historians to the fellow who just managed to pass American History:<br/><br/>Scenario 1: The Invasion of Canada - 1775 to 1776 - Can YOU do better than the bumbling General Schuyler and Benedict Arnold in the vain American atttempt to make Canada a 14th colony?<br/><br/>Scenario 2: The Saratoga Campaign - 1777 - Can YOU as General Horatio Gates surround and destroy the forces of the British General Burgoyne in this reinactment of the turning point of the Revolution?<br/><br/>Scenario 3: Greene's Southern Campaignv - 1780 to 1781 - Can YOU as General Nathaniel Greene lead Cornwallis' tested regulars on a merry chase with your force of rag-tag militia and Guerilla bands without being crushed in a major engagement?<br/><br/>Scenario 4: The Yorktown Campaign - 1781 - Can you duplicate Washington's encirclement and crushing defeat of Cornwallis in the battle that won the Revolution?<br/><br/>Contents: <br/><br/>     a 16&quot; x 44&quot; four-section, full color mapboard depicting colonial America from Quebec to Georgia; <br/>     two sets of die-cut troop counters representing over 400 units of Continentals, British Regulars, Rebel and Tory Militia, French Regulars, Indians, and naval units of the British and French fleets; <br/>     1 die; <br/>     1 Terrain Effects Chart; <br/>     2 sets (8 per set) of Tactical Combat Cards used in the innovative, new Sustained Combat system; 1 set of scenario, CRT, and play chart cards organized on an index-card format that puts a summary of all levels of the game at your fingertips; <br/>     a 32-page Rules &amp; Designers' Notes Manual telling you how to play all 6 game versions plus the inside story on research and development and why the game was designed the way it was.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Rated &quot;Tournament Level&quot; on Avalon Hill's Simulation-complexity scale.<br/><br/>Note: 1st edition has 416 counters (this includes some blanks)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"215701": "Avalon Hill Bicentennial edition"}, "name": "1776", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "6.4304", "usersrated": "821", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "age": "12"}, "3313": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic272331.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"5668": {"name": "Michael Kuby"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1987", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "7", "boardgamepublisher": {"404": {"name": "Alga"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic272331_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"12384": "1992 Mensa Select Winner"}, "description": "Traverse is played on a square &quot;checker&quot; game board with a 12 1/2&quot; x 12 1/2&quot; grid.

The game consists of five sets of octahedral stiff paper dice, about 2&quot; per edge, with five team members per set.  These dice have full-color comic-book style artwork by Eduardo Muller and game information printed on each face, and each die represents a character. Each die is pre-cut and scored, and assembles easily with just tabs and slots.  Despite being made from &quot;mere paper,&quot; the dice are surprisingly sturdy, and the use of a good quality card stock means they tend to stay in good condition. Unless you accidentally sit on one, of course.<br/><br/>The basic goal is to be the first person to reach 50 points, which are earned by &quot;killing&quot; your opponent's characters.  Each turn, you may throw a new character into the arena (if you have any available to throw), have one of your characters use his or her action or power, or have one of your characters move.  Movement is done by rotating a die onto a new face on the table.  If you throw a new character into play, he or she may immediately use his or her power on the side that lands face up. Available powers may be an attack or a special action. Some of the special actions allow you to, in turn, use the powers of other teammates, triggering a cascading reaction across the table.<br/><br/>Attacking is simple: Each attack has a power rating.  If it exceeds the block rating of the defending dice, the defending dice is killed, and the attacker scores its points (printed on side one of each die).  If it is equal or less than the defense value, the defending die is merely moved so that a lower value face is face-up, unless it's been &quot;wounded&quot; so many times that it's already on its lowest face, in which case, it dies.<br/><br/>A basic game of Diceland lasts about 20 minutes.<br/><br/>List of Diceland sets and armies<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"180945": "First edition"}, "average": "6.46882", "name": "Diceland: Deep White Sea", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "269", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5496": "Thematic Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"13": "Diceland Series"}}, "3340": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic235374.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"3942": {"name": "Hard Vacuum: Science Gone Mad"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1369": {"name": "Darrell Hayhurst"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2000", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": {"1369": "Darrell Hayhurst"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"285": {"name": "Fat Messiah Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic235374_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1046": {"name": "Fighting"}}, "description": "Hard Vacuum is a sci-fi space combat game based in a fictional World War II. The players take on the roles of pilots from either the U.S. Space Corps or the German Raummacht in about a dozen well balanced scenarios spanning from around 1942 to 1945. The game requires you to supply the playing surface (the rules are designed for either a hex field or a completely free form field) and the dice (which ideally should read 0-5 instead of 1-6). The counters are supplied on a laminated piece of paper roughly the same quality as the cover of the book, you must cut them out.<br/><br/>Each turn begins with each player secretly marking down how much thrust they are applying to which thrusters on their ships. These are simultaneously revealed, and thrust markers are added/removed as needed. Because space is a vacuum, thrust applied in one direction will mean you go in that direction until you compensate for it!<br/><br/>The next part of the turn is the combat phase. Players must roll the dice to determine if they can still see their opponent. If they can see their enemy can they shoot. All the players fire their weapons simultaneously, and then they apply the results of hits and criticals at the same time. The turn is now complete.<br/><br/>There are significant technological differences between the American and German spacecraft. The German craft are generally more powerful, but have a limited supply of fuel and weapons, while the American craft are weaker, but their fuel and weapons supply automatically recharges each turn.<br/><br/>Hard Vacuum is aimed at any fan of classic sci-fi, dogfight, or space combat games. It has a lighter, almost comic book quality in its setting and the game does not get bogged down by complex rules or mechanics.

Players may have conflicting goals for the route to be taken as each tries to gain rewards for connecting different cities. Some branching is allowed but each line has a limited number of track pieces.<br/> The particular cities which will reward individual players are accumulated throughout the game by drawing blind from a deck of identifying cards.  The more different lines arriving at a city, the higher the score will be for that city.  Later in the game 4 short lines  also become available.<br/><br/>An updated version of Alan R. Moon's White Wind game Santa Fe.<br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>The deck is composed of city cards (with some short lines shuffled into the middle third). Players have a hand of 4 city cards to start the game. Each round, players simultaneously select a card to play, then reveal. City cards are added to your personal display -- essentially, you have a share in that city. There are also several special cards (2x, 3x, 4-in-one, Branch Line, Boomtown) that modify the basic game turn. These specials are on public display, and can be acquired at the end of each round (some cost $1; the 2x may be held, but the rest must be played immediately after acquiring them).<br/><br/>Then, in turn order, going twice around, players add a single track to any of the railheads (each of the 5 lines has specific starting locations on the board). If the link is to a previously unconnected city, collect $2. In addition, if the city is one of the goal cities of that train line, collect $4.<br/><br/>After all players have gone (twice), pass the start player marker to the left. THEN, in turn order, players bring their hand total back to 4 (draw from deck and/or from cards on display). If a Short Line card is revealed, discard the card and draw again; that Short Line is now in play. They choose a card to play, and repeat above.<br/><br/>The game ends when 3 (or is it all?) track lines are completely used up. Each city's value is equal to its base value, printed on board, multiplied by the number of different train lines connected to it.

Denmark, Norway, and the Low Countries have been overrun. France, the victor of 1918, has fallen. Greece and Yugoslavia have now been crushed. Britain stands alone, freed from the threat of invasion by the courage and skill of its air force and navy. But Britain is stalked and assaulted by the Nazi wolfpacks, and in North Africa a mixed garrison of British and Commonwealth forces is besieged in Tobruk by Rommel and his Afrika Korps.<br/><br/>Then, on June 22, Hitler launches Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of Stalin's Soviet Union. As the panzer spearheads slice through the bewildered Russian defenders, it appears that nothing can halt the Nazi tide. But the course of History has just taken a major turn. The Last European War is over; World War II has begun. It will end four years later, in a bunker in the ruins of Berlin.<br/><br/>World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin covers those four years of epic struggle, from Moscow to Stalingrad, from Tobruk to Tunis, from Sicily to Rome, from D-Day to the Rhine, to the final battles for the Reich. Designed by Ted Raicer as a follow-up to his award-winning WWI strategic game, Paths of Glory, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin modifies the Paths of Glory systems to capture the strategic and operational dynamics of WWII in Europe.<br/><br/>As in Paths of Glory, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin uses a point to point map, this time covering all of Europe from France to the Urals, and from Norway to North Africa. Units are armies and corps (fronts and armies for the Soviets), and each turn represents three months. The movement and combat systems will be familiar to Paths of Glory players, but have been modified to recreate the blitzkrieg campaigns of 1941-45.<br/><br/>As in Paths of Glory, the heart of the game lies in the 110 Action Cards (55 each for the Axis and Allied players). Each card can be used for operational movement and combat, strategic movement, replacements, or for an Event. Events include:<br/><br/><br/>    Individual leaders (Patton, Guderian, or Rommel the Desert Fox) <br/>    Tactical innovations and new weapons (Fortified boxes, Tiger tanks) <br/>    Strategic Warfare (U-boats, Bomber Command, the 8th Airforce) <br/>    Reinforcements (Soviet Mechanized Fronts, PanzerArmee Afrika, Patton's Third Army) <br/>    Allied Invasions, actual or potential (Torch, Sledgehammer, Husky, Overlord) <br/>    Politics and Diplomacy (Hitler Declares War, Casablanca, Yalta, Operation Axis) <br/>    Irregular Warfare (Partisans, the Maquis, Otto Skorzeny)<br/><br/><br/>World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin presents both the Allied and Axis players with a wide range of exciting game choices, while illustrating the key historical factors of the war; from the importance of mechanized forces in combat to the importance of oil to fuel them, but without the complexity of other strategic WWII designs. And unlike many of those games, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin lives up to its title: an Axis player who fails to win the war may still win the game. The winner is often decided on the last turn as the Allied player struggles to extinguish the last traces of the Nazi empire.<br/><br/>It is June 22, 1941: Will WWII end in German triumph in Barbarossa or collapse in Berlin?

These letters are available to all players on their turn.<br/><br/>Before starting play it should be decided that either 3-letter, 4-letter or 5-letter words are to be established as the basis of play.<br/><br/>Then the first player draws a letter from the pool. Keeping it hidden, he tries to form one word of 2 or more letters with the letter in his hand and with at least one or more of those letters face up on the table. He may also form the word with only the face up letters and not use the letter in his hand. Whenever a player forms a word, his turn ends.<br/><br/>If a player cannot form a word, or if he forms one but doesn't use the letter he has drawn from the pool, he must discard this letter at the end of his turn. The letter is discarded by putting it face up with the other turned up letters on the table. Then the next player moves.<br/><br/>When a player forms a word, he places it in front of him facing it to the center of the table. This is done so the other players can easily see it. It gives them the chance to steal words. As the game continues and players gather words, they may steal the words from one another. This is done by taking all the letters of another player's word and adding one or more letters to it to completely change that word's meaning. The letters added to a word in &quot;stealing&quot; may be the one drawn by the player from the pool or one or more of those face up.<br/><br/>Adding S to make a word plural (or ED or ING) does not change the meaning of a word and cannot be used to &quot;steal&quot; a word. Any letters at all, however, can be used in &quot;stealing&quot; a word if the new word formed is entirely changed in meaning.<br/><br/>Players should make their own words harder to steal by adding letters to them and making them more complex. This counts as a complete turn and is as important as forming new words.<br/><br/>When all of the tiles have been drawn from the pool, players, continue in turn to try to form words using the face up letters. The game ends when there are no more face up letters, or when no player is able to move using the remaining face up letters.

It is the first in the GMT Musket &amp; Pike Battle System covering warfare in the 17th Century. The system emphasizes Command and Control and the unique style of combat in that era. Armies are divided into three of four wings. Each wing has an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Wings may change their order, but it is not an easy task to accomplish. Victory goes to the commander who can coordinate the actions of these wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry brigades, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries. Rules include Cavalry Charges, use of the Cavalry's pistols to skirmish or use in close combat, artillery grazing fire, Infantry techniques of fire including advancing, retreating, and salvo firing. Play is highly interactive, and a battle can be played through in one sitting.<br/><br/>The battles included in this game are:<br/><br/>Edgehill, 23 October 1642<br/>    Is the King beholden to Parliament or is he truly sovereign? King Charles and his army, their way to London barred by the army of Parliament, have drawn up to give battle. Edgehill was the first major battle of the war. Robert Devereax, Earl of Essex, commands the army of Parliament sent to prevent the King's army from reaching London. The fighting is indecisive as the bloodied Royalist foot fall back, but Essex conceded the field despite receiving reinforcements. A major victory for either side could have ended the war here.<br/><br/>First Newbury, 20 September 1643<br/>    Outmaneuvered, Essex, with the Royalists under King Charles between his army and London, is forced to fight. Essex spies a hill southwest of Newbury and in the early morning occupies it. Hedges line the area and help minimize the King's advantage in Cavalry.<br/><br/>Marston Moor, 2 July 1644<br/>    The largest battle of the war. It decided the fate of Northern England. An allied army of Scots under the Earl of Leven, the Northern Association under Ferdinando Fairfax, and the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester laid siege to the King's Northern Army under the Marquis of Newcastle at York, the key to the North. King Charles dispatched his nephew, the talented Prince Rupert, to effect a relief. The defeat was complete; the Royalist army was utterly destroyed and the North lost to Parliament. A new hero arises here: Cromwell, a name synonymous with the English Civil War and the key player in the later two civil wars.<br/><br/>Second Newbury, 27 October 1644<br/>    The disaster that precipitated the forming of the New Model Army. Three Parliamentary armies come together and catch the King by surprise just north of Newbury. The most unconventional of all the battles; the superior Parliamentary force attacks from either end, but is short on time. Various options on gaining more time by shortening the flank march give this action high replay value.<br/><br/>Naseby, 14 June 1645<br/>    The debut of the New Model Army and the battle that broke the back of the King's army. The New Model Army was created by combining the elements of the major armies in the field. While this worked well for the cavalry, there were serious problems in the infantry ranks. The King's army was outnumbered, but it retained its corps of veteran infantry. The final result was a decisive defeat for the King and the end of his military fortunes. Though fighting would last another year, the King would never field a potent army again.<br/><br/>COUNTERS: 635 full-color die-cut counters.<br/><br/>MAP: Two 22&quot;x34&quot; full-color back-printed mapsheets<br/><br/>OTHER: <br/><br/>    One 10-sided dice<br/>    16-page Rulebook<br/>    24-page Playbook<br/>    2 11x17 Player Aid cards<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>DESIGNER: Ben Hull<br/>DEVELOPER: Marty Arsndorf<br/>ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

The majority of your games will easily end in a single evening, thanks to sudden death victory conditions providing variable game lengths that eliminate the &quot;end of the world&quot; phenomenon that plague many games. Often, you'll set 'em up and knock 'em down twice a night, and once in a great while your Campaign game will require two nights of play for the terrific panoramic history to unfold before your eyes.<br/><br/>Like similar card-driven games, The Napoleonic Wars provides strategy cards that are played as events or to activate leaders, armies or fleets (by play of command points) to move on the map. Players must constantly weight the value of an event or reaction card against the need for its command points. Command points themselves can be played for a wide variety of activities, making play unpredictable and fresh with each sitting.

Players can rearrange their Mobilization Points to change the change the force allocations from the historical ones to reinforce their effort or to better counter the enemy's.<br/><br/>Both side must rapidly attack and defend at the same time...and you'll never have enough troops and power to do both perfectly, so your allocation of scarce resources will be the key to your success.<br/><br/>This system uses a two-tracked method of determining victory. It isn't the usual &quot;one side tries something, while the other tries to stop it&quot;. Rather, both sides must strive toward their own goals while putting forth enough effort to stall the enemy. It is possible for both sides to &quot;win&quot; ending the game in a net draw (which is why you'll need to dedicate some effort to stopping the enemy support).<br/><br/>Drive on Paris is the seventh game in the popular, easy-to-play Standard Combat Series. These games are designed to be easy enough for novice players, yet meaty enough to retain the interest of veterans. It violates two principals of game design at the same time: Easy games are dumb, and the converse that interesting games are hard. The SCS challenges these bogus assertions...and has successfully done so for eight years now.<br/><br/>Part of the Standard Combat Series by The Gamers.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1/2 week<br/>Hex: 6.2 miles / 10 Km<br/>Units: Brigades to Division<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>Two dual-side printed countersheet (420 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 8-page SCS version 1.6 system rulebook<br/>One 24-page Drive on Paris specific rulebook<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Low<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-12 hours<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"243326": "The Gamers edition"}, "average": "7.00373", "name": "Drive on Paris", "playingtime": "300", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "134", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"17520": "Cities: Paris (France)"}}, "3412": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic468450.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1400": {"name": "Mark Miklos"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2000", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"71": "Rodger B.

This was His Majesty's Royal Army, commanded by General Sir William Howe. They were marching through the extreme southeastern corner of Pennsylvania and heading toward fledgling America's capital at Philadelphia. Only short weeks earlier this army had disembarked at Head of Elk, Maryland, after a 32-day voyage from New York City aboard the largest armada North America has ever seen. With some 14,000 troops, including crack German mercenaries and elite American Loyalist units, Howe's army was about to execute a flanking maneuver of &quot;Jacksonian&quot; proportions.<br/><br/>General George Washington, holding interior lines at Morristown, New Jersey, was unsure whether Howe would move north in support of the British invasion from Canada (see Saratoga, 1777), or whether he would move south against the Capital. Once the armada set sail, however, Washington shifted southwest and took up a naturally strong defensive position, on high ground behind Brandywine Creek, astride the main road to Philadelphia. Washington posted his troops advantageously and in depth. Control of the fords of the Brandywine would be the key to his position and although a possible flank attack was discussed, it's likelihood was discounted on the strength of local information.<br/><br/>Thus the stage was set. Howe, pursuing a strategy of posts, sought European style victory in a sudden taking of the enemy capital. Washington wrote, &quot;Should they push their designs against Philadelphia...they will put the contest on the event of a single battle. If they are overthrown...the war is at an end.

The float and march south from Canada had almost a surreal quality juxtaposed against the Adirondack wilderness. Hundreds of vessels making up an immense inland navy on Lake Champlain transported nearly 9,000 combatants together with 138 cannon. Burgoyne's objective was Fort Ticonderoga and from there, Albany, and a rendezvous with British forces coming from New York City. The strategic purpose of the campaign was nothing short of an end to the American Rebellion.<br/><br/>The intrigue on the American side lay in the cult of personality. Saratoga was to be Benedict Arnold's greatest victory in a string of successes which rank him among the finest field commanders of the era. Known to all Americans as the great traitor, it is ironic to discover that twice he salvaged the Revolution from certain collapse. It was Arnold's conspicuous gallantry and bold leadership which assured America victory at Saratoga and, by extension, its independence.<br/><br/>The fighting at Freeman's Farm would be savage. Here no farmer's militia, but rather Continental Regulars (anxious to redeem a recent reputation for retreat), stood toe to toe with Europe's finest. The sanguinary nature of the fighting was summed up best by American Brigadier General John Glover who said, &quot;Both sides seemed determined to conquer or die.&quot;<br/><br/>It's the 19th of September, 1777. Do you, as the British, attempt to storm the prepared American positions on the high ground at Bemis Heights in order to open up the River Road and the most direct route to Albany? Or do you attempt to turn the American left where intelligence reports the American defenses are incomplete and the ground favors your approach? How will you employ the large number of Hessian mercenaries in your army? Will their performance match their reputation?<br/><br/>As the Americans do you wait on Bemis Heights for the approach of the enemy as General Gates preferred, or do you sortie and meet the approach of the British in the forests where their artillery will be of little value? Will Generals Gates and Arnold cooperate, or will their feud spell disaster for the American cause? And what of the fog on this chilly Autumn morning? Will it be an ally to the Americans by impeding the progress of the enemy?<br/><br/>These are only a few of the challenges facing you as you relive one of history's most decisive battles and the turning point of the American Revolution.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"32231": "First Edition"}, "average": "7.11692", "name": "Saratoga", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "333", "boardgameaccessory": {"170214": "Saratoga: Mounted Mapboard"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"54": "Battles of the American Revolution"}}, "3414": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic361595.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"406": {"name": "Dean Essig"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1995", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"406": "Dean Essig"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"219": {"name": "The Gamers"}}, "maxplaytime": "240", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic361595_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": {"1069": {"name": "Modern Warfare"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"22217": "1995 Charles S.

Fresh from his victory in Poland, Hitler planned a blow that would knock France out of the war. key to this plan was knife-like attack through the Ardennes to the English Channel which would split the Allied forces moving north to block the expected replay of 1914 and the Maginot Line forces immobile in the south. To add to the trap, the Germans planned the first massive airborne operation of the war. This attack would capture the hinterland of Holland, pave the way for subordinate German Armored thrusts crossing the Maas, and to continue the lure the Allies northward.<br/><br/>Fallschirmjaeger covers this bait. The German player plops down an airborne invasion force with the goal of fighting off all-comers until relieved by advancing ground forces. The Dutch, all but abandoned by their French and British Allies, put up a fight for the record books. The German air bridge held on by its fingernail. While the main German drive was never in doubt, these scattered paratroopers had the fight of their lives against a small nation unwilling to succumb without giving the fight everything.<br/><br/>In the end, the Dutch government had to be evacuated along with the Dutch Gold Reserve, to form a government in exile. They would return after liberation.<br/><br/>The player must do all these things, or smash the German paratroopers before they are rescued by the Panzers, to win.

First player to achieve 100 points (or higher) wins that round, and play continues for as long players wish.  The winner is whoever has the most chips to his name (in typical poker values of 1, 5, and 10).  Number of max players seems to be only limited by the number of poker chips you use (each player starts with 50).
