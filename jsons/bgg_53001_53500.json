It provides a &quot;campaign template&quot; for running a dual-world game. By combining the sourcebook with your own favorite setting you can take your fantasy characters and run them through a modern day scenario, or take your modern characters and run them through one of the many fantasy modules currently available. Most modern settings already describe the impact of fantasy elements on them and include rules for handling magic. But what would happen if people from the modern world regularly trafficked with those in a more traditional fantasy world? What impact would it have if powerful wizards originally studied computer science at UCLA? What would the social institutions look like if the progress of ideas and politics we've seen in our world carried over to a place where electricity and gunpowder simply didn't work, but magic and divine power did?<br/><br/>The Sourcebook supports both the d20 Modern Rules and the standard d20 rules and provides a complete set of genre and technology rules for customizing the way reality works in the two worlds, in alternate planes, or even in your own game world. Over 200 powers spread across 8 prestige classes (with an alternate, feat-based system)are detailed. Each class gets to pick one ability per level from a list of at least 25 special powers; this provides maximum customizability in character development. It also includes a complete set of influence rules with over 30 organizations and 100 favors to request; this system provides a nifty method for adding crunch to the political aspect of a game. The Second World Sourcebook also provides a basic campaign setting designed to show off the full potential of genre jumping.<br/><br/>"}, "53407": {"rpgitemversion": {"9212": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Farm", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic546033.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "average": "5", "rpgissuearticle": {"101740": "Top Five Survival Horror RPGs"}, "rpg": {"2633": "The Farm"}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpggenre": {"158": "Horror"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic546033_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>A Modest Proposal<br/>The Farm is a horror roleplaying game about the lives and deaths of people trapped in a mysterious place called &quot;the Farm.&quot; Players start the game knowing precious little of their environment or their fellow captives.<br/><br/>Over the course of the game, they&rsquo;ll learn more about the dire situation in which they now \ufb01nd themselves.

Barbaric Oshalogwan Elves roam the plains and hills. The lowering brows of the Worheim Mountains hide the innumerable tunnels of the secretive Dwarves. Crennian Elves, onetime servants of the mysterious Qaali, flit through the shadows of ancient woods. The villages of the Talonian Humans spread south along the great Kriegstrom river.<br/>All these races and more walk the streets of Dinas Ffordd in an uneasy truce, come to trade at the busy docks, worship at the mighty Teithian Cathedral, or work in the enormous Millrace. The &quot;Town of the Ways&quot; is the keystone of a peace that has lasted eight centuries. But now cracks are appearing...<br/><br/>Your characters have come to Dinas Ffordd to stay. They have fortunes to seek, jobs or connections to exploit, businesses or families to protect. When disturbing events occur, the bold must step forward to defend the helpless and discover the truth: Who would want to break a peace that has proven so profitable to everyone?<br/><br/>What threatens Dinas Ffordd threatens you. Come inside, and fight for what matters.<br/><br/>WorldWorks leads the industry in beautiful, downloadable cardstock scenery for games of all kinds.

Now for the first time all the non-human races and beasts of the world of Legend are gathered under one cover.<br/><br/>Humans think they rule the Lands of Legend, but they do not. Even the most powerful live in terror of the things that lurk in the shadows, or prowl the wild country, or creep into the depths of a guilty man&rsquo;s dreams.<br/><br/>The spirits of long-dead kings and chieftains guard their ancient barrows, or lie waiting under the soil for the call to protect their homeland once again. An Eaves Phantom can torment a family for generations. Sailors live in terror of the Blue Men whose rotted longships rise from the deep to issue fearsome challenges.<br/><br/>Stranger still are the automata, created by the scholars of ancient empires, who may reveal lost secrets for an awful price; or the Obsidiak, a human head carved from granite, with tentacles for a neck; or the malicious creatures of the faerie: goblins, caitshee, spriggan and many others.<br/><br/>And the less said about the Jumbees, the Hellrots or the terrifying Grey Hood, the better. In the Lands of Legend, being eaten alive is often the least of an adventurer&rsquo;s fears.<br/><br/>The Dragon Warriors Bestiary contains full descriptions and game-information for more than 120 of the races and species that inhabit the Lands of Legend.<br/><br/>The book is divided into seven sections including the man-like races, the monsters of folklore, the supernatural, strange beings created or summoned by sorcery, the inhabitants of the Abyss, and the undead in all their ghastly forms.<br/><br/>Be warned that the creatures of the Lands of Legend are not what you expect. The Dragon Warriors Bestiary takes classic monsters back to their roots in mythology and superstition, puts a new spin on well-worn fantasy archetypes, and introduces new races and species that will challenge and threaten your players. The rich background and atmosphere in the descriptions is perfect for building exciting adventures and rich, evocative campaign-settings.<br/><br/>This book also contains information on creatures&rsquo; habitats and treasure, random encounter tables for different environments, and great artwork from Jon Hodgson, Scott Purdy and Erik Wilson.<br/><br/>"}, "53494": {"rpgitemversion": {"9290": "Hardcover version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Dragon Warriors", "rpgproducer": {"14904": "Adrian Bott"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic557897.jpg", "usersrated": "37", "rpgsetting": {"2046": "Legend"}, "average": "7.71622", "rpgissuearticle": {"33275": "Arcana of the Elements Combined"}, "rpg": {"1040": "Dragon Warriors (Revised Edition)"}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic557897_t.jpg", "description": "The Dragon Warriors rulebook is a 256-page complete introduction to a life of adventure in the Lands of Legend, with all the information and rules that you need to play the game.<br/><br/><br/>     Seven character classes: knights; barbarians; assassins; sorcerers; mystics; elementalists; and warlocks<br/>     A complete description of the world of Legend<br/>     Hundreds of spells, magic items and monsters<br/>     All the rules needed to explore the world of Legend and deal with its inhabitants&mdash;whether they&rsquo;re friendly or hostile<br/>     Examples of play comic-strips<br/>     Stunning artwork and cartography from Jon Hodgson, Erik Wilson, Scott Purdy, Scott Neil, Andy Hepworth and Andy Law<br/><br/><br/>The Dragon Warriors rulebook contains everything needed for a newcomer to the exciting world of roleplaying games to learn how to play, and enough depth and invention to keep experienced and jaded players happy.

In these typical French countryside landscapes, thousands of men are about to fight. And die. Bravely like heroes, or cowardly like wussies. But only heroes really matter. Those you see in Hollywood Golden Age war movies. Here lies the inspiration for Heroes of Normandie; here is what the game has to offer: explosive and fast-paced battles; the pleasure of butchering your enemies through MG42 walls of lead; and the ability to crush Nazi bastards under tons of shells &ndash; basically, blood and guts.<br/><br/>A miniatures game without miniatures, Heroes of Normandie is a fast-paced WW2 strategy wargame inspired by Hollywood war movies. A tactical scale board-game opposing two players and two armies, with the Germans on one side and the Americans on the other. Players use order tokens to determine initiative and to bluff. While a single six-sided die determines combat, action cards are played to spice things up. Secretly plan your attacks and outwit your opponent. Block the opposing strategy and surprise the enemies.

From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>&quot;On a cool, wet July 4th (a day the children who heard the story recalled as bright and sunny) an Oxford mathematician (who, according to his diaries suffered from strange visions) created the first of two works: each with exactly 12 chapters. They are encoded survival guides meant as warnings. They are an old and new testament for a coming age of insanity.<br/><br/>&quot;The number 12 is not arbitrary (months in the year? Hours in the day?): in the second book (Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There) the 10th and 11th chapters have only 59 and 38 words respectively. What do you think that means?<br/><br/>&quot;It means Wonderland is coming.<br/><br/>&quot;When you enter Wonderland there are two kinds of Descent: controlled and uncontrolled. Uncontrolled (falling down the rabbit hole) is the first book. Survival is a matter of luck and chance. The characters are cards. The second kind of Descent is controlled. That happens in the second book (crawling through the mirror). Survival is a matter of skill. The game is chess.<br/><br/>&quot;The narrative is disguised as a children's story: we are assured nobody is killed. The book is an encrypted warning: we are told that nobody is a person who is very, very hard to see. If nobody is alive then there's also a stack of bloody severed heads in the alcoves of the Queen of Heart's castle.<br/><br/>&quot;The walls of reality have cracks in them. There are cracks in the world.<br/><br/>&quot;Disney may have understood the message but their movie has hidden things even deeper. There is no such book as Alice in Wonderland (the name most adults know both works by). There were always clues in the artwork: the Knave of Clubs is in the court room illustration, the Knave of Hearts is in the poem as Lewis Carroll was formally trained in symbolic logic none of this is coincidence.

Washed away, the simple joys of celebrity worshipping magazines, daytime TV and chocolate. In other words, the world as we know it has been turned into Hell on Earth.<br/><br/>Early in the 21st century things went horribly wrong. The world was ripped apart as a great war rent great nations asunder. Meanwhile, a horrific, man-eating plague and devastating economic collapse sapped the very essence of those the war had spared. Temperatures rose as the long-term effects of global warming were finally realised and millions of square kilometres around the equator now lie in blasted ruin. Even as the world looked set to rebuild itself after the traumas it had suffered, a powerful earthquake levelled most of the major cities already weakened by the terrors of global conflict.<br/><br/>Now women have taken their place as the dominant gender, controlling the remnants of the civilised world and oppressing men under their stiletto heels. Call it 21st century empowerment, call it exploitation if you like, it is a fact, deal with it. In this cut-throat world of the post-apocalyptic horror every girl is out for herself, getting whatever she can by whatever means necessary.<br/><br/>Those men who survived the effects of the man-eating plague are enslaved and subjugated by barbaric cultures in which men are treated as second-class citizens or mere property, precious but inferior.<br/><br/>The world of Macho Women with Guns is a complex, clashing, mishmash of different styles and periods. Almost every Science Fiction and Fantasy clich&eacute; you can think of exists here. The world of today is populated with every size, description and type of woman from Renegade Nuns hunting down the Bat-Winged Bimbos of the Devil on the streets of Los Diablos to the members of Alice Capone&rsquo;s gang stalking the clubs and dens of Chicago.<br/><br/>With a machine gun in each hand and a whole lot of attitude Macho Women with Guns is a light-hearted jaunt into a world of mindless violence, destruction and high heels.<br/><br/>Let&rsquo;s bust some balls!&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "53246": {"rpgitemversion": {"9048": "Screen"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Top Secret Administrator's Screen", "rpgproducer": {"1013": "Allen Hammack"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic534628.jpg", "usersrated": "5", "average": "6.1", "rpgissuearticle": {"15935": "Capsule Reviews"}, "rpggenre": {"350": "Crime (Criminal / Law Enforcement)"}, "rpg": {"920": "Top Secret (1st and 2nd Editions)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic534628_t.jpg", "description": "From the cover:<br/><br/>START:<br/>Find enclosed one TSR Top Secret Administrator's Screen, with all necessary game charts and tables.
