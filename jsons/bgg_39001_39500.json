It features several pivotal battles in Baltic region of the late 17th century - a period where rulers struggled to centralize power in their realms and to introduce permanent standing armies instead of expensive mercenary forces. It shows the highly trained and well led army of Sweden struggling to defend its massive gains from the Thirty Years War and the Northern Wars of 1655-1661 against the forces of Denmark and Brandenburg, reinforced by contingents from Austria, the United Provinces, M&uuml;nster, Hesse-Kassel and Poland.<br/><br/>The personalities in the game include the great Swedish warrior king Carl XI, Brandenburg&acute;s Frederick William (the Great Elector), and King Christian V of Denmark-Norway. Never before have so many monarchs been in one M&amp;P box!<br/><br/>Nearly all the scenarios in this module are smaller than the typical Musket &amp; Pike scenarios, and thus take less time and space to play. For the same reasons it is a great introductory game to the series.<br/><br/>The Historical Background<br/><br/>The Scanian War was prompted by the Franco-Dutch War of 1672-1678. Sweden had allied with France against several European countries, and was eventually forced to fulfill her treaty obligations to France by invading Brandenburg. This invasion was an attempt to force Brandenburg to withdraw from the fighting against France, but the invasion was conducted without the usual energy and force of previous Swedish offensives. When the Brandenburg Army returned home much faster than anticipated the Swedes started to withdraw, but were caught by the Brandenburgers and defeated at the battle of Fehrbellin on June 28th 1675. The previously &quot;unbeatable&quot; Swedish Army had lost a battle, and this key event soon persuaded others to join the war.<br/><br/>Most notable of these was Denmark, which saw its chance to regain the Scanian lands lost in the Northern Wars. (Scania is the southern tip of Sweden, just across the Oeresund, the Sound, from Denmark.) After mopping up the Swedish possessions of Wismar and Bremen, the Danish Army landed in Scania on June 29, 1676. Danish King Christian V led 15,000 troops against a defending Swedish Army of 5,000 men that were spread out over the province. Initially the operation was a great success. Large parts of the local peasantry sided with Denmark and the outnumbered Swedish troops were in bad shape. Town after town fell into the hands of the Danes and the Swedes had to retreat north to Sweden proper. After a month only the fortified town of Malm&ouml; remained under Swedish control. At sea the situation wasn&acute;t any better for the Swedes, as their navy lost several battles against the combined Danish- Dutch Navy, and left the command of the sea in the hands of the allies.<br/><br/>Two factors helped to save Sweden from ruin: the splendid courage of their young king who resolutely and successfully kept the Danish invaders at bay, and the diplomatic activity of Louis XIV, the French king.<br/><br/>The first ray of light for the Swedish cause came with the battle of Halmstad in August 1675 when the king succeeded in outmaneuvering and destroying a small Danish force sent north to take Halmstad and link up with the forces operating out from Norway. As the Swedish Army slowly grew larger it became possible to meet the Danish main army head on, and the Swedes were victorious at the battles of Lund in December 1676 and Landskrona in June 1677. These battles caused the fighting to stalemate on the Scanian front, as the Danish could supply and reinforce their coastal fortresses by sea, but didn&acute;t dare venture inland to meet the Swedish Army in a field battle again.<br/><br/>The focus of the war therefore shifted to the German front once again, where the Brandenburg Army was slowly conquering the Swedish fortresses and fortified cities one by one. The Danish Army sent an expeditionary force to the island of R&uuml;gen and captured it, but lost it again in January 1678 after a winter of horrid attrition, when the Swedes returned to the island once more and defeated them in the battle of Warksow. Later in 1678 the Allies would take R&uuml;gen once more, and eventually all the Swedish possessions in Germany were lost.<br/><br/>Events in Western Europe would once again have far reaching effects on the Baltic as the end of the Franco-Dutch war in 1678 gave France the power to force an end to the Scanian War and dictate the peace treaties of Fontainebleau. These treaties restored almost all the Swedish possessions lost during the war, and so the end result was truly &ldquo;Nothing Gained but Glory.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The 7 battles included in Nothing Gained but Glory are:<br/><br/>Nyborg, November 14, 1659 - (While not part of the Scanian War, this bonus battle from the Northern War of 1655-1660 features many of the same participants.) The Swedes had occupied the Danish island of F&uuml;nen, but following the landings of two Allied forces and their subsequent combination the Swedes had to fight to win time for an evacuation from the island. With no more room to retreat and the port town of Nyborg&acute;s fortifications in a sorry state, the 7,000 strong Swedish Army positioned itself in good defensive terrain between a lake and a forest. While command difficulties in the 11,000 strong Allied Army almost cost them the battle, the Allies eventually prevailed, forcing the Swedish Army to flee to Nyborg, where it surrendered the next day.<br/><br/>Fehrbellin, June 28, 1675 - Returning from fighting against France to face the Swedish invasion, the highly mobile Brandenburg Army of 5,600 cavalry and 13 guns faced a retreating Swedish Army of 7,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry and 7 guns outside the town of Fehrbellin. A poor deployment of the Swedish Army combined with aggressive handling of the Brandenburg cavalry forced the Swedes from the field. Although the losses in the battle were about equal, the Swedish Army was severely reduced by the subsequent pursuit, raiding peasant guerilla, desertion, and starvation. While only of minor importance militarily, the victory had an enormous psychological impact: the Swedes, long considered &quot;unbeatable&quot;, had been bested. With the myth of Swedish invincibility broken, Denmark decided the time was right to settle its scores with Sweden and entered the war. Frederick William henceforth was known as the &quot;Great Elector&quot; and the army that he and Derfflinger had led to victory became the core of the future famous Prussian Army.<br/><br/>Halmstad, August 17, 1676 - After the initial great successes for the Danish forces following the landings in Scania in late June 1676, a small Danish force of 3,500 men under Jacob Duncan was detached from the main army and ordered to advance north to take the town of Halmstad and if possible link up with the Norwegian forces under General Gyldenl&oslash;ve. Sensing the possibility of destroying the unsupported Danish detachment, the Swedish king reacted and by heavy force marching succeeded in cutting off Duncan from his line of communications, forcing him to fight his way back. Duncan moved against the Swedes, but then went on the defensive. The Swedes took the initiative, collapsed both of the Danish flanks, and then overwhelmed the center, forcing the army to surrender. This battle ended the Danish plans of linking up with the Norwegians, and provided a much-needed boost to Swedish morale.<br/><br/>Lund, December 4, 1676 - This was the bloodiest battle in the history of Scandinavia, with almost 9,000 killed (out of 12,000 Danes and 8,000 Swedes) after an intense day-long battle fought in the chilling cold of the Scandinavian winter. After a cross-river standoff that lasted for a month, the Swedes attacked when the river froze. The Swedes initially had the advantage, and their right wing (along with the king) routed the Danish left and pursued it off the field. The rest of the Swedish Army was then outnumbered, and just as they were about to succumb, the king and part of his wing showed up in the Danish rear, saving the battle for the Swedes.<br/><br/>Malm&ouml;, June 25-26, 1677 - Malm&ouml;, the regional capital of Scania, was the only major town that didn&acute;t fall during the 1676 Danish offensive, and had been a thorn in the Danish side ever since. In June 1677 the Danes decided to take the town by besieging it.<br/>When news arrived that the Swedish Navy had set sail to break the blockade of the town and that the Swedish Army was moving to relieve the town, the Danes decided to force the issue and storm the town, even though the siege hadn&acute;t progressed very far. On the Swedish side, the town commander Fabian Fersen prepared his 2,300 strong garrison well, and they fought with desperate courage as they knew it was victory or death. While the Danes were able to scale the wall and break into the city, a determined Swedish counterattack destroyed them before they could open the gates for more Danish troops.<br/>(This is a medium sized battle on a half map with various special rules to reflect the many special circumstances of storming a fortified town at night.)<br/><br/>Landskrona, July 14, 1677 - After the defeat of the Danish Army at Malm&ouml;, the Swedish king decided the time was right to attack them before they could be reinforced by their German and Austrian allies. He thus moved his 10,000 regulars and 4,000 peasant militia towards the Danish Army located at Landskrona. However, the Danes had received their reinforcements that replenished their numbers to 14,000, and the Danish king felt confident about fighting a field battle. This was a hard-fought battle which saw both armies experimenting with combined arms wings and the personal involvement of the monarchs of both armies.<br/><br/>Warksow, January 18, 1678 - As the war had reached a stalemate on the Scanian front the Danish forces invaded the island of R&uuml;gen in the fall of 1677. They quickly conquered most of the island except for a small Swedish fortified bridgehead. As supplies ran low and attrition ravaged the army, large parts of the Danish expedition were withdrawn from the island, leaving just under 5,000 men. This allowed the Swedes to transfer 3,500 men from their field army in Germany to the remaining bridgehead in early January 1678 and try to take back the island. The armies met at Warksow, where a Swedish cannonade killed the commander of the Danish Army, paralyzing it. Most of the Danish expeditionary force was captured during the battle or in the aftermath as the Swedes quickly cleared R&uuml;gen.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>1 series rulebook<br/>1 playbook<br/>3 countersheets<br/>2 2.5 map sheets, 2 of which are backprinted<br/>1 10-sided die<br/>3 Player Aid Cards<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"71688": "English First Edition"}, "average": "7.70026", "name": "Nothing Gained But Glory", "playingtime": "300", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "0", "usersrated": "194", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"9793": "Age of Kings"}}, "39020": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic389147.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"267": {"name": "Klaus Zoch"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2008", "maxplayers": "7", "boardgameartist": {"28156": "Eva Paster"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"87": {"name": "Zoch Verlag"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic389147_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1039": {"name": "Deduction"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"12422": "2009 Deutscher Lernspielpreis \"9 years and up\" Nominee"}, "description": "Professor P&uuml;nschge is wandering home from his laboratory, and it's up to the players to find out the path he is using.

Players assume the side of RED (Republican forces &ndash; the elected government) and BLUE (anti-Republican forces/ &rdquo;Nationalists&rdquo;/ Fascists / Francoists &ndash; those seeking to overthrow the elected government) in the Spanish Civil War (SCW). This epic conflict involved the toppling of a democratically elected government, its replacement by a totalitarian regime, significant foreign intervention, a major component in the march towards WWII and a struggle for control of Spain.<br/><br/>Each side begins enlisting its political &ldquo;camps&rdquo; (BLUE: Nationalist Army, Carlist, Falange and Army of Africa, RED: PCE, Republican Army, UGT, Anarchist, POUM, Cataluonia and the Northern Autonomous Governments ) to build their national armies and by gaining support from foreign powers (BLUE: Germany, Italy and Portugal, RED: Britain, France and Russia) to improve their resources to wage the conflict. Players will also decide their resource investment in force preparation: there is an &ldquo;untried columns&rdquo; mechanic very similar to one first utilized by Panzergruppe Guderian.<br/><br/>There are three phases to a game turn: Strategic, Action and Logistics.<br/><br/>The Strategic Phase requires players to &ldquo;spend&rdquo; their Action Cards (think of ACs as currency) planning their turn, influencing political dynamics (enlisting support of &ldquo;camps&rdquo; and &ldquo;foreign powers&rdquo;), impacting the battle for hearts &amp; minds, pursuing alternative historical foreign policy paths and shaping the air and naval war. Additionally, players construct a Hearts &amp; Minds (H&amp;M) pool. The H&amp;M pool is supplemented during the turn by wide variety of actions and events (reflecting the vagaries of support for both sides); the more friendly H&amp;M blocks placed into the pool, the greater the chance of gaining dominant control of Spanish provinces.<br/><br/>During the Action Phase, players utilize their respective decks of Action Cards (ACs) to activate units for movement and combat, implement events (receive reinforcements, etc.), conduct a range of political operations, generate replacements or strategically redeploy units. And, in a twist from other games in the Paths of Glory genre, players must plan out their play of ACs in advance: players secretly specify the order of play of their ACs (&quot;the AC stack&quot;) and allocate one AC to &quot;the AC reserve&quot;. Limited air operations occur during the Action Phase.<br/><br/>During the Logistics Phase, players addresses attrition, rebuilding units, determining province control and other odds and ends. Province control is a function of controlling Provincial Presence Locations and the Provincial Capital and making a successful Province Allegiance Attempt (H&amp;M blocks have an important effect). One key H&amp;M dynamic is a random draw from the H&amp;M pool, placing those H&amp;M blocks on provinces and a variable ending to the phase; players are not quite sure &ldquo;when the music will end&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The campaign game is playable in about six to eight hours, while a shorter introductory scenario takes between two and four hours. The game is won by controlling key geographical locations (ex: dominant control of provinces and control of urban areas), which generates victory points.<br/><br/>Triumph of Fascism is somewhat of a sequel to Triumph of Chaos(ToC). Changes verses ToC include inclusion of: <br/>&bull; A less abstracted air and naval components<br/>&bull; A significant hearts &amp; minds mechanic <br/>&bull; More of an emphasis on the build up to the conflict<br/>&bull; A foreign policy track; allowing for a wider range of outcomes the conflict could take<br/><br/>Both games utilize the Paths of Glory game engine, supplemented by a significant political &ldquo;game&rdquo; component, which has its roots in Days of Decision and Persian Gulf: Battle for the Middle East.<br/><br/>Spring 2105<br/><br/>"}, "39065": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic386660.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1997", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"8868": {"name": "N.Z.

Wargamers can create simulations of the simplest encounter or the grandest strategy.  Armoured warfare in miniature has a special appeal.<br/>The model tank wargamer can take advantage of the superb range of miniature model tanks available and the many books detailing modern weaponry to recreate this style of fighting that was born on the Somme in 1916 and came of age in 1940.  Perfect scale models and accurate rules combine to produce an almost faultless simulation of tank warfare - all that is missing is the clatter of tracks, the roar of engines and the crump of shellfire.<br/>This book lays the complete groundwork on the subject.  It explains how to use the many different armoured fighting vehicles, their guns, caliber, missile weight, range, angle of impact, thickness of armour; and does the same for anti-tank weapons.  It provides essential information on communications, mines, infantry co-operation, aircraft and armoured operations, and battlefields; it also provides practical information on how to assemble armoured forces in miniature and table-top terrains over which they can battle.<br/>The authors are well known veteran wargamers.  Donald Featherstone served with the Royal Tank Regiment in North Africa and Italy during World War II; his associate, Keith Robinson, is an adviser to one of the main manufacturers of model fighting vehicles for wargamers.<br/>Together they have clearly and simply brought this modern style of warfare to the table-top battlefield and provide technical and tactical advice against a fascinating background of wargaming narrative with ten historical scenarios spanning the lifetime of the tank, from an armoured car action in 1914 to the Middle East conflicts of recent history.<br/><br/>"}, "39133": {"boardgamedesigner": {"6730": {"name": "Georg Appl"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Zoo-Spiel", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic979976_t.png", "boardgameartist": {"11658": "Michael Wollert"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3138": {"name": "Espenlaub"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic979976.png", "boardgameversion": {"228156": "German edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Childrens' game of collecting animals in the form of cardboard tiles from a board representing a safari type environment.<br/><br/>Players roll dice and then move that many spaces exactly in an attempt to land on the correct space to collect the animal.<br/><br/>Person with the most animals at the end is named the Zoo Director &amp; the winner.<br/><br/>(My German is not the best so if anyone cares to translate the rule manual and update this description please do.)<br/><br/>"}, "39134": {"boardgamedesigner": {"4802": {"name": "Peter Jones (I)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Future War Commander", "playingtime": "150", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "26", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic395605_t.jpg", "average": "7.40385", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"14804": {"name": "lulu.com"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic395605.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"235240": "lulu softcover edition 2009"}, "maxplaytime": "150", "boardgamecategory": {"1047": {"name": "Miniatures"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "150", "description": "FutureWarCommander is a wargame in line with Blitzkrieg Commander and Cold War Commander.<br/><br/>FutureWarCommander is an exciting wargame that allows you to re-create battles of the future using miniatures on a tabletop.

While I was designing GridIron Wars, an idea popped into my head<br/>regarding a similar method to resolve a baseball game. After putting the idea to paper and mailing it to a couple of trusted friends,<br/>HardBall Wars was born. HardBall Wars is simple enough for a child to learn, but robust enough to satisfy even the most veteran of baseball gamer.<br/><br/>Many may wonder, why a baseball game? Aren&rsquo;t there plenty of good ones already on the market? In short, the answer is yes. There are many<br/>fantastic baseball games on the market. With HardBall Wars, I&rsquo;m really not re-inventing the wheel. You&rsquo;ll never hear me tout the game as<br/>better or more realistic than any other game currently on the market.<br/><br/>However, having said that, I do feel like this game stands up well against any other baseball game in terms of what is truly most important,<br/>the &ldquo;fun factor&rdquo;. My testers and I have had an absolute blast playing the game. The unique batter-pitcher interface, combined with the X-<br/>Factor deck, makes the game unique and in my humble opinion very fun to play.<br/><br/>My philosophy with Downey Games has always been to price games as low as possible, making the games accessible to all. Most current baseball<br/>board games sell in the $50-$60 range. While that is reasonable to most, it does make it an expensive proposition to purchase multiple<br/>seasons or teams. With HardBall Wars, I&rsquo;ve purposely designed the game with a cost factor in mind. For that same $50 or $60 you&rsquo;ll be able<br/>to purchase multiple seasons of HardBall Wars. Also unlike other games, we strive to rate nearly every player who stepped foot on the field<br/>of play.<br/><br/>HardBall Wars is based upon a modified log5 method. That may not mean much to some, but using this method allows the pitcher and batter to<br/>&quot;Interact&quot; on every at-bat. Rather than a 50/50 model or a generic pitcher grade, with HardBall Wars you'll see the difference between<br/>pitchers and batters and their impact on the at-bat in a very visual way. You'll also immediately see the difference in righty/lefty<br/>matchups at the plate.<br/><br/>Fielding is not neglected in HardBall Wars. You'll see the difference between the gold glove shortstop and the lead gloved fielder not only<br/>in terms of errors committed but also the ability to turn hits into outs.<br/><br/>The most unique aspect of HardBall Wars is our introduction of the X-Factor Deck. And often times it can generate a lot of excitement.<br/><br/>Within the X-Factor deck just about anything you&rsquo;ve ever seen in a baseball game can take place. From run downs, appeals, dropped third<br/>strikes, rain delays, rain outs, ejections, brawls to even the extremely bizarre like the now famous Pine Tar incident&mdash;all are possible<br/>within the X-Factor Deck.<br/><br/>The deck is far more than just a Rare Play mechanism. There are many conditional events within the deck and even some very mundane plays.<br/><br/>The X-Factor deck simulates the events that happen in real life that as a tabletop gamer you don&rsquo;t often see in your own gaming. One can see<br/>something out of the ordinary in almost every baseball game in real life. And we have brought that to the tabletop through the use of the X<br/>-Factor Deck.<br/><br/>With HardBall Wars, the decisions as a manager are all yours. You decide when to steal bases. You decide when to Hit and Run or Sacrifice<br/>the runner to the next base. You'll make the call when to intentionally walk the opposition&rsquo;s slugger, or when to bring the infield in to<br/>cut down a runner at the plate. You'll make the call as when to attempt a squeeze bunt or play for the big inning. You'll make the call to<br/>bring in the lefty specialist to face the opposing left hand slugger, or stick with your right hand throwing starter. With HardBall Wars, you<br/>may even be ejected from the game! Nearly every situation that faces a major league skipper is replicated in the game.<br/><br/>The printed game features game charts printed in full-color, the season of your choice, 3 dice, a die-cut X-Factor deck also printed in full color, score sheets all packaged in a sturdy game box.<br/><br/>"}, "39156": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Battle B-Dabeast", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "2006", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1048324_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"51": {"name": "Hasbro"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1048324.jpg", "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "expands": {"23204": {"name": "Battle B-Daman"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Test your B-Daman battle skills with this target game that's loaded with new gameplay and challenges.

The Opener card, and other attribute cards, are distributed to the players in destiny piles.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, your destiny, and the destiny of the other players, will gradually be revealed. The Opener is destined to break the walls that keep past, present future, the dead, and the living separate. If you discover that you are The Opener, your goal is to complete the opening ritual by killing all of the other players.

Ghosts can only win if a Haunting card that gives them a win condition is in play. What are Haunting cards and how do they work? You add Haunting cards to your destiny pile when you are haunted by ghosts or if you fail a destiny search. A Haunting card comes into play when another player probes your destiny pile and finds a Haunting card.<br/><br/>Haunted Destinies uses a tiled board system similar to Betrayal at the House on the Hill, but each tile edge indicates the minimum number of movement points need to leave through that edge.

Each card shows six incredible names of animals, each of them belonging to one of these species: mammals, reptiles, fish, birds, butterflies, and impossums. Only the first five species are &quot;regular&quot; species. The impossums are fake animals (impossible animals). Their sole purpose is to provide suggestions for bluffing. Bluffing is important for winning - and for having fun!<br/>One game is about guessing to what species an animal belongs. As the animal names must be read aloud, it is good exercice for kids to read and pronounce.<br/>The other two games are different in depth and demand. There are alphabetical and morphemic rules for putting down cards. For example: <br/>You can put down a card only if <br/>- either it shows the name of an animal of the particular category that fits alphabetically (= starting with the same letter as the reference animal or with its first letter following or coming before that letter), or if<br/>- a part of the name of an animal is identical with a part of the name of the reference animal (example: &quot;blue-and-gold-fusilier&quot;, a fish, thus matches with &quot;blue-crowned motmot&quot;, a bird). If it belongs to the same species, you can put down a further card, if it belongs to another category you just switch the species.<br/>If both is not possible, you can try some bluffing. The cards are played face down.<br/>You must pronounce the name of the animal when putting your card down. Each card put down can be controlled. When your bluffing is detected, you get malus points. When you habe put your cards down &quot;regularly&quot;, however, the one who has controlled gets malus points.

Players risk losing points for making poor decisions and for bad die rolls, but unlike most earlier CYOA books, seldom (if ever) risk character death. While the adventures are designed for solo play, the adventure points system allows for competitive, partnership or cooperative play by several players.<br/><br/>Characters have different RPG-like attributes (name, life-form, allegiance, charm, knowledge, navigation, power, skill, stealth, strength, weaponry and talents). Devices and Powers that the characters might use are rated for accuracy in different circumstances. Similarly, Vehicles are rated by type, speed, distance, stealth and weaponry. Combinations of these attributes are used along with d10 or d20 rolls to determine &quot;adventure numbers&quot; during decisions and confrontations that, in turn, affect both the direction of the storyline and the adventure points score.<br/><br/>Star Wars Adventures is packaged in a plastic carrying case shaped like a flattened Clone Trooper helmet. The base game includes a membership card, adventure poster, d10, d20, character cards, power cards, device cards, vehicle cards, an adventure guide, notebook, point pad, adventure novel and game book. Expansions include additional cards of all types, posters, novels, magazines and game books. Modules in the series are as follows:<br/><br/>1.

This will be the first game in the series Sengoku Jidai, which will cover battles in 16th century Japan. The system is designed so players can finish a game in an evening, and has simple but dynamic mechanics.<br/><br/>In the game, each player takes the role of a commander in chief. Each army consists of various clans, and the players have to choose an action for each of their clans. Each clan is represented by 1 to 3 units. The units have various abilities, summarized by the 4 factors: &eacute;lan, mass, fire and the presence of a leader. Elan represents factors such as the unit's mobility, and its boldness in attack, and is also used to reflect the advantage that cavalry can have over infantry when attacking. The unit's mass represents its staying power, such as its ability to resist a cavalry charge or a rout.<br/><br/>A unit's abilities are tied to the value of its four factors and the current mode of the clan that it belongs to. A clan can be placed in one of four modes: Attack, Defense, Move, and Rally. The owning clan's mode will affect a unit's ability to move or engage in combat.<br/><br/>A game turn consists of alternating phases where a player can activate his units. The order in which activations will occur is tied to a chit pull system.<br/><br/>The game system requires each player to plan carefully how to win. They must maneuver to gain numerical superiority, deploy in terrain that takes advantage of their clan's mode, and try to surprise his opponent by attacking troops that are not prepared.<br/><br/>The system also places the players under the same historical limitations as the actual Japanese leaders. Japanese generals of this time prearranged their battle plans and coordinated their armies with a precise system of semaphore flags and sound signals.<br/><br/>The game includes 2 scenarios: one depicting the historical battle, and a &quot;what if?&quot; hypothetical scenario. In the historical scenario, Takeda's army is divided in two contingents. One of the contingents is taken by surprise by Uesugi's army, and has to fight a holding action until the rest of the army can come to its aid.<br/>The hypothetical scenario explores what could have happened several days before the historical battle.<br/><br/>In Kawanakajima 1561 a hex represents about 250 meters and a strength point corresponds to around 100 men.<br/><br/>Game components:<br/><br/>     1 map A1 (84cm*60cm)<br/>     228 game counters (88 5/8inch, 140 1/2inch)<br/>     one rule book with scenarios<br/>     Game play aids<br/>     Cardboard jacket<br/>     4 dice<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"40699": "Hexasim first edition"}, "name": "Kawanakajima 1561", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2057": "Chit-Pull System"}, "average": "7.635", "usersrated": "60", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "age": "0"}, "39191": {"boardgamedesigner": {"11358": {"name": "Kevin Kim"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Fund Manager", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "27", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic588040_t.jpg", "average": "6.18518", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"8890": {"name": "Playoff Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic588040.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"27314": "English edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "age": "11", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Released in Essen 2008, Fund Manager is a game about the stock market.

Each tree segment has four bark sections around it.  On their turn, a player gets two taps with the axe to try and knock off pieces of bark from the tree segments for one point a piece. But be careful, if a tree segment comes down it's minus 5 points!

In Game One: The grid begins empty except for the word LOOKEE spelled out in the center. Using at least one letter on the board each player must take turns making their own word (with the 7 tiles they began with) using at least one pre-existing tile.Each turn must be finished within 30 seconds. These words could be spelled forward, backward, horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Each player scores points for all the letters on their new word. After each turn, the player who went replenishes back to seven tiles. The player with the most points after the grid is filled is the winner. Game Two: First player to reach 100 points wins. In this game, the entire tile board is filled with letters at random. The first player tries to locate a word in any direction, and receives the added points for that word. The tiles used are then flipped over creating a new board every turn. The next player goes and so on. Only 30 seconds per turn. Game Three: Same as game two except additional option. Look for letter groupings that can be rearranged to form words. E.G. T,C,R,U,K can be TRUCK. First to 100 points wins. Game Four: Play solitaire by setting up the board as in Game One.

In the solitaire version, the child attempts to correctly construct all 16 figures. In the two-player version, children flip tiles one at a time by turn, trying to build the leaders.  The child with the most complete leaders wins.<br/><br/>The game for 6-and-overs plays with a simple Go-Fish mechanic where 2-3 players take turns trying to reconstruct the famous leaders of French history by asking each other for specific body parts and pulling from the draw pile if they don't get them.  Again, the winner is the player who has reconstituted the most historical personages before the draw pile is gone and someone has run out of tiles.<br/><br/>"}, "39261": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic393907.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"12552": {"name": "J.

If you have that game, just print out these components and you can play Buck Rogers 2.0.<br/><br/>It is a game of conquest set in the inner solar system in the 25th century; the board features the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, along with the Asteroid belt.  Players build armies and space fleets and struggle to control these territories; whoever has the most territory at game end wins.<br/><br/>Each player controls a character from the Buck Rogers universe, who grants the pieces around him or her special abilities.  These special powers will often dictate that player's strategy.<br/><br/>Each game turn begins with each player bidding for turn order and then building new units.  They can build these units at factories, and can also buy mercenaries from the black market.  They can build ground units, which are vital for controlling planets, and spaceships which are necessary for traveling from one world to another.<br/><br/>Then, in turn order each player moves his or her units; they may move as many or as few of their units as they like.  At the end of this phase, combat will occur if any player's units are in the same zone as another's, though combat can happen during movement if one player tries to move units through or out of a zone containing enemy units.<br/><br/>In combat, units are moved to a &quot;battle board&quot; which allows the players to make tactical choices for their units.  The front section is the &quot;battle line&quot; where units may fire but are vulnerable to enemy fire, while the rear section is the &quot;reserve line,&quot; where units may not fire but are protected from enemy fire by units in the battle line.  Each unit has a set of numbers it needs to roll on a d10 in order to hit; which number it needs depends on the unit it is firing at.  Once only units from one faction remain the battle is over.<br/><br/>Once all battles are complete, if no player has won the game the planets and asteroids all move forward one zone in orbit around the sun.  Since different planets complete orbits in different amounts of time, players need to watch for &quot;conjunctions&quot; where planets are close to one another and the opportunity exists for players to move from one planet to another quickly.<br/><br/>Changes to the original game include:<br/><br/>     Balanced Leader Abilities<br/>     9 new leaders - including 3 from the 1930's serial films <br/>     Turn order decided by bidding instead of randomly<br/>     Expanded Territory-Based Black Market Production <br/>     Use of the Cards During the Game (not just for setup)<br/>     Expanded Pass-through Fire Rules<br/>     The Tactical Battle Board for Combat<br/>     Offensive Gennie Variant (no more gennie turtling!)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Upgrades:<br/><br/>    Buck Rogers: Battle for the 25th Century Game<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"23485": "Print and Play Edition"}, "average": "7.3", "name": "Buck Rogers 2.0", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "10", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "expands": {"548": {"name": "Buck Rogers: Battle for the 25th Century Game"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"19441": "Characters: Buck Rogers"}}, "39297": {"boardgamedesigner": {"138": {"name": "Leo Colovini"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Star Wars Clone Wars: Das letzte Gefecht", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "6", "boardgamefamily": {"5602": "Star Wars"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic679329_t.jpg", "average": "2.46667", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"311": {"name": "Clementoni"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic679329.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"113091": "German edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1064": {"name": "Movies / TV / Radio theme"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The large, strategic board game Star Wars - Das letzte Gefecht features the ultimate last battle deciding on victory or defeat of the Jedis.

It&acute;s a wargame about alternative World War II, with bloody battlefields, zombie soldiers, giant robots, hybrid human/gorilla soldiers, and so much !<br/><br/>The core module comes with two maps, counters (for Russian and German army) and a rulebook. This game is a tribute to the old and classic Dwarfstar Microgames and Metagaming Games.<br/><br/>A Little Part of History<br/><br/>On the 16th of November of 1943, near the districts of Varena, a wood area in Lithuania, there was a fact that definitely changed the course of World War II. A small garrison from Wermacht taking care of that region lived idyllically, in spite of rumors about the defeat in Stalingrado and Kursk have been already heard by higher officers. Rumors about Russian victories and withdrawal of army were public. It was about 3 o&rsquo;clock in the morning when the small garrison led by Sergeant Joseph Blummer was woke up by a loud hiss, followed by a large explosion. Everyone thought it was an artillery attack, or even worse, the Russians were invading the country. An alert was issued and 12 men armed themselves as they could and prepared to fight. After tense 30 minutes, only the silence was left, and a gleam from a burning wood was visible. The sergeant quickly got 5 men to follow him in a half track car to see what was happening. They went and were shocked to the spot and a surrealist scene: a vehicle in a shape of a disk, intact, but half buried in the ground due to the impact. The men immediately surrounded the place and sent a radio message to the garrison; they thought it was an experimental German aircraft, since the Fuhrer said new fantastic weapons would come from the Reich labs to the war effort.<br/><br/>Less than 3 hours later, 4 Ju-52 landed carrying SS elite troops, with Himmler himself! The men were both frightened and amazed, because the discovery they made was very important. By 8 A.M., there were over 500 SS soldiers, who arrived by land, beginning to investigate the vehicle. By 11 A.M., Von Braum himself had arrived with his team and they prepared to move the strange vehicle. Joseph and his men were removed from the place, transferred to Berlin, where they were received honors; a distinction from Hitler himself was being promised. What the soldiers didn&rsquo;t know, however, is that Germany had received a gift that would change the course of war.<br/><br/>Armies of the Game<br/><br/><br/>    Germans : Led by Adolf Hitler, spreads the terror worldwide. Using powerful weapons and bio-soldiers, they stand as the most feared army at war.<br/>    Soviets : Biggest enemies to the Germans in Europe. Leaded by Joseph Stalin , they are the arch-enemies of the Nazis.<br/>    Anglo-Americans : The gathering of armies by the U.S.A , England and all the others ally countries. A lot of bio soldiers and outstanding weaponry.<br/>    Nazi Mekas is originally a microgame for two players developed for the MDC III (Microgame Design Contest III), organized by Tom Higgins at Boardgamegeek Forum Boardgame Design.<br/><br/><br/>AN IMPORTANT NOTE!<br/><br/>This game doesn&rsquo;t support Nazism, any other totalitarian political regime, or any human rights oppression. We want to remember that our goal is to show the new generations that war is one of the worst madness of mankind, and Nazism, above all, was an aberration and craziness from disturbed minds, who decided to finish the freedom and parity of men. A madman achieved the power in a big country in Europe and plunged the world in a nightmare for 5 years, resulting in the holocaust and onslaught of more than 50 million human lives.  We loathe this political regime and reject everything it has done to Jews, gypsies, citizens and millions of soldiers from many countries, including Germany itself, who lost their lives to end this nightmare.<br/><br/>"}, "39336": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic397715.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"12166": "Funkenschlag"}, "is_expanded_by": {"22355": {"name": "Atolla Modulis (fan expansion for Funkenschlag)"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"141": {"name": "Friedemann Friese"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2008", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"11827": "Lars-Arne \"Maura\" Kalusky"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5657": {"name": "Filosofia \u00c9ditions"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic397715_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"19796": "2009 Lys Passion\u00e9 Finalist"}, "description": "This is the new entry for the Filosofia printing of Power Grid.

The French edition is produced by Filosofia.<br/><br/>As with Power Grid, the object of M&eacute;gawatts is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size.  In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.<br/><br/>However, as plants are purchased, newer more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.<br/><br/>Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.<br/><br/>It differs from Power Grid by the maps included. Where Power Grid has the USA/Germany maps, the French version by Filosofia has the Qu&eacute;bec/France maps.<br/><br/>The Qu&eacute;bec map uses minor rules change that makes a bigger use of the renewable power plants to represent the regional reality of hydro-electricity.<br/><br/>The ruleset includes the basic game, as in Power Grid plus the minor rule changes for the two maps included.<br/><br/> Re-Implements: <br/><br/><br/>     Power Grid<br/>     Funkenschlag<br/><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/><br/>     Power Grid: France/Italy<br/>     Power Grid: Benelux/Central Europe<br/>     Atolla Modulis (fan expansion for Funkenschlag)<br/>     Power Grid: The New Power Plant Cards<br/>     Power Grid: China/Korea<br/>     Power Grid: Flux Generator<br/><br/><br/>The expansions Power Grid: France/Italy, Power Grid: Benelux/Central Europe and Power Grid: China/Korea include new double-sided game boards.

Detectives travel between the city of New Angeles and moon colony Heinlein chasing down leads, calling in favors, and uncovering the sinister conspiracy beneath it all. The detectives must balance their pursuit of the murderer against their personal lives and their inner demons. Android&rsquo;s innovative mechanics ensure that no two detectives play alike. Will you play as Louis Blaine, the crooked cop tormented by guilt and loss? Or will you take the role of Caprice Nisei, the psychic clone who struggles to retain her sanity while proving that she&rsquo;s as human as anyone else? Whoever you choose to play, you&rsquo;ve got just two weeks to solve the murder, uncover the conspiracy, and face your personal demons.<br/><br/>During a round, the players get action points to spend on various actions, like moving their detectives, following leads that appear on locations, solving their personal demons, or doing a location-specific action. In this way, the detectives try to advance on three different sectors: solving the murder, uncovering the conspiracy behind the murder, and finding their inner peace. To solve the murder, the detectives follow leads that appear on New Angeles and Heinlein, and find evidence that they plant on the suspect of their choice. The conspiracy puzzle is also solved by following leads, and may alter the way victory points are distributed at the end of the game. Finally, each detective has his/her own personal plots that are resolved gradually throughout the game. If the detective invests enough time in the plot, he/she will be awarded victory points; otherwise, he will suffer penalties.<br/><br/>The game ends when two in-game weeks (12 rounds) have passed. At that point, victory points are awarded based on the aforementioned sectors.

Towards this end, the Soviets amassed two ground armies, one air army, and an impressive amount of artillery.

From the designer's website:<br/><br/>One of the biggest differences is the figure scale (1=40 rather than 1=20). Then there's the way you move your units around. In GdeB the orders system means that you can't always do what you'd like and when you would like it. In Die Kriegskunst this is even more apparent, as we've made it a little harder to change orders. We've also introduced a new type - the &quot;Approach&quot; order - used to recreate those great Frederickean flank marches. Is &quot;Frederickean a word? Well, it is now! Even more restricting is the way units manoeuvre. there are no columns (well, only in really limited situations like storming breaches), and in the age of linear warfare, moving a brigade from column of march into line was a complicated business.<br/><br/>We think we've found a way to simulate this fairly simply, but even so you really have to figure out where your troops are going and where they'll deploy well in advance. For example, a battalion in column of march (one stand behind the other) has to wheel to the right, then halt. the next turn it moves all the stands through 90 degrees, so that they no face the enemy - thereby forming a line.  Now, if you imagine doing this for a whole brigade, then for a division-sized force with one or more brigades forming a second line, and you've got some idea of how tricky the whole thing is. Of course, you can start your games in line, facing the enemy and raring to go, but we needed to produce a system to get the guys there in the first place!<br/><br/>Other differences include modifications to the firing mechanics, a new system for firing at chargers (charging cavalry into formed infantry is rarely a smart move), and a downgrading of skirmishers. While these may sound like little more than little tweaks, they actually represent a lot of work and experimentation - trying to keep the basics of the existing system while adapting it to reflect the linear tactics of the period.<br/><br/>Basing is the same as for other General de Brigade sets (although we use slightly larger bases ourselves - four 28mm infantry figures on a 40x40mm base). A full strength Prussian battalion is 20 figures, an Austrian one is 24, and a Russian one is 16. Heavy cavalry ride around in 20 man units, although the Russians should really be smaller due to their chronic cavalry resupply problems - 12 man for Cuirassier units and 16 for others. I just have to have more Russians to make up for the small units - and of course there's my pretty but less than effective Cossack horde...<br/><br/>"}, "39398": {"boardgamedesigner": {"11428": {"name": "Craig Blumer"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Mountain Climber", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "13", "boardgamefamily": {"6043": "Sports: Mountain climbing"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1178573_t.jpg", "average": "6.11538", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1178573.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"22580": "Print and Play Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Mountain Climber is a &quot;push-your-luck&quot; dice game, but everyone is playing at all times with no boring waiting between turns.

The goal is to capture the opponents' pieces and to move your own pieces to the opponents' starting rows.<br/><br/>Players have nine towers in three heights and three shapes (squared, hexagonal and triangular prisms). To set up the game, players lay out the game boards, then take turns placing towers one by one on the starting edges of their game boards, five towers on one board and four on the other.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player must move one tower one space forward, either straight or diagonally; the player can choose freely which tower to move on which game board, but moving on one board precludes movement on the other, so choose wisely! A tower can capture another tower by moving onto its space, but only in the right circumstances. If the two towers are the same height, the capturing tower must have more sides than the one being captured; if their heights differ, the capturing tower must be one level taller than the tower being captured. The exception is the smallest triangular tower, which can capture the opponent's tallest hexagonal tower. A tower can also move sideways when capturing, but not when merely moving on the game board; thus, even after a tower reaches the opponent's back row, it might still be at risk of capture (or possibly the one doing the capturing).<br/><br/>If no captures are possible on a game board, that board is frozen and players can no longer move their pieces on it. As soon as two boards are frozen, the game ends. Players score five points for each tower they've captured and three points for each of their own towers that has reached an opponent's starting edge.

These headlines represent real corporate, government, technology, economic, and other events that have affected the prices of real stocks in the market.<br/> Each player gets 2 private cards, and 5 cards are dealt face-down to the table.  The 2 private cards you were dealt are your Research Reports, and the information on them will move the stock price up or down, depending on whether the news is good or back for shareholders.  Just like the company research reports published by real analyst firms, this information gives you a trading advantage over others with less knowledge.<br/><br/>In Market Maker, you will buy and sell shares of a single company&rsquo;s stock with other players.  To make a profit when trading stocks, you will need to buy shares at a low price and sell them at a higher price.

At the end of the of the game, everyone&rsquo;s Research Reports will be made public, and the final closing price will be 100 plus or minus all the cards that were dealt.

It was first described in 1986 by the ethnologue Peter J. Claus, professor at the State University of California at Hayward (USA).<br/><br/>The game plays an important role in the Siri cult of South Kanara. It is prohibited to play the game after the rice seedlings (neji) are in the growing fields and up to harvest time. There is an old custom in the Bant caste of playing the game by the male head's of the boy's and girl's families during the marriage negotiation ceremonies (niscaya). It is regarded a good omen if the girl's party loses. The game is also often associated in Siri legends. Another prohibition is to lend out the board overnight and gambling. More prohibitions concern the players. Sisters are not permitted to play the game together (not even classificatory sisters, e.g. a woman with her husband's sister), nor are brothers (including classificatory brothers, e.g. mother's brother and sister's son), nor husband and wife. The game is not normally played among men except in association with marriage alliance. The social prohibitions coincide with an asymmetrical relationship within families characterized by potential feelings of jealousy, competition, aggression and self-interest which could destroy the strength and unity of a matrilineal family.<br/><br/>The Cenne board is usually made from hard, dense wood such as rosewood or ebony. The counters are the small seeds of the arnotto tree (Bixa orellana), the coral tree (Erythrina caffra) or cowrie shells.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>The board called mane has 14 holes (variously called guri (&quot;pit&quot;), illu (&quot;house&quot;) or kone (&quot;room&quot;)) arranged in two rows and two larger hollows at either end used for storing captured seeds. Each player owns the store to his right.<br/><br/>Initially there are four seeds (parelu or kayi) in each hole.<br/><br/>On his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes in the ensuing holes, one by one, in a counterclockwise direction.<br/><br/>If the last seed falls into an occupied hole, its contents are lifted for another lap.<br/><br/>During a move a seed may not be dropped into a hole containing three seeds (called murte) unless the player has just one seed seed in his hand.<br/><br/>In rare circumstances all holes may have three seeds. If the player still has one or several seeds in hand, he puts these in the hole to his far right (called atappe (&quot;heap&quot;)) without capturing them. The opponent then takes the three seeds from his heap and drops one of them in his opponent's heap, another one in that hole from which he removed the seeds and the last one in the next adjacent hole on his side, giving it four seeds, which he then captures, thus ending the move.<br/><br/>This seed, which would become a singleton, is called jeppe (&quot;sleeper&quot;) and may not be used to begin the next turn.<br/><br/>If the last seed in hand is placed into a murte, its contents becomes wanasu (&quot;meal&quot;), that is, all four seeds are captured and put in the player's store.<br/><br/>Afterwards the player continues his move by distributing the seeds of the following hole.<br/><br/>The move ends when the last seed is placed in an empty hole, when the hole following a wanasu is empty or after an atappe play.<br/><br/>The game is played until a player can demonstrate at his turn that in four consecutive draws he does not have to place a seed in one of his opponent's holes. That player wins the seeds that are still remaining on the board.<br/><br/>The player who captured more groups of four has won the round.<br/><br/>The successive rounds are played by filling the holes on the player's side with his winnings. Holes that cannot be filled are not used in the next round. It is possible, albeit difficult, to reconquer lost holes. Seeds that are not used in the round are stored as if they were captures.<br/><br/>The game is over when at the beginning of a round a player can fill less than four holes.

It was a popular pastime of young boys when they were herding cattle of goats. The game is almost forgotten today. There were special terms for certain moves and various holes, but no one seems to remember them now.<br/><br/>The board was usually dug into the ground. The game was played with small pebbles or the seeds of the mubuthi tree (Caesalpinia volkensii).<br/><br/>Giuthi was first described in 1925 by the English ethnologue Orde Brown in his book The Vanishing Tribes of Kenya.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Giuthi is played on two-rank boards numbering from five to ten holes per row.<br/><br/>The number of stones in each pit varies from four to nine. Four is preferred on the smallest boards, six on the medium-sized ones and eight on the larger boards. Nine stones per hole on a two-by-ten board gives the first player a big advantage and could therefore be regarded as a kind of handicap when two players of unequal strength are playing.<br/><br/>Each turn starts with a hole that contains at least two seeds.<br/><br/>The seeds are either distributed in the clockwise or the counterclockwise direction into the succeeding holes in the first lap of a move.<br/><br/>If the last seed falls into a non-empty hole, its contents (including the last seed) are distributed in another lap in the opposite direction.<br/><br/>If the last seeds falls into an empty hole of your own side, the player moves again, unless he has placed at least one seed into an enemy hole during this move.<br/><br/>If the last seeds falls in one of your empty holes and you have played into the opponent's territory (see proverb (bottom)), then you capture the seeds in the enemy hole just across and the last seed that was distributed.<br/><br/>If this empty hole is followed in an unbroken chain by more empty holes on your side, then the seeds in the opposite holes are also captured.<br/><br/>When the last seed falls into an empty hole of your oponent, the turn is over.<br/><br/>A player must move if he can. He must pass, if he can't, but must move again, if he has something to play with.<br/><br/>The game ends when no longer any moves can be made or when the board position repeats.<br/><br/>Each player scores as many points as he has captured seeds and as he has seeds in his holes at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The player who has more points wins the game.<br/><br/>Variants:<br/><br/>The following board sizes were recorded by ethnologues: <br/><br/>     2 x 5 holes. Number of seeds not given. <br/>     2 x 6 holes with 4 seeds per hole. For beginners. <br/>     2 x 7 holes with 6 seeds per hole.

Said to be the most popular variant when played on a casual basis. <br/>     2 x 10 holes with 9 seeds per hole. Quite unbalanced - the first player can capture 10 seeds in the first turn without being threatened in the next. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The most challenging variant that is well balanced is played on a 2x10 board with 8 seeds per hole.<br/><br/>Giuthi proverb:<br/><br/>You can't steal the cattle of another man without entering his land!&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "39476": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Hoyito", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"9": "Mancala"}, "average": "7.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"171": {"name": "(Public Domain)"}}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A manqala game.<br/><br/>From Wikimanqala:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href='http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Hoyito_I' rel='nofollow'>http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Hoyito_I</a><br/><br/>&quot;These are the rules of the more well-considered hoyito game. <br/>It was recorded as being played in Barahona, Neiba, Villa Jaragua, Los R&iacute;os, Postrer R&iacute;o, La Descubierta and Port-au-Prince.<br/><br/>It's a two players game. <br/>It is played on a board made by two rows of six holes (other sizes were recorded, but 2x6 seems the more common). <br/>At the beginning each hole has four pieces<br/><br/>Each player controls the row closer to him. <br/>Players take turns to move. <br/>At her turn the player takes all the stones from a hole belonging to her side of the board, and sow them counterclockwise. <br/>If the last stone lands in an occupied hole all these stones (the one just landed plus the ones that were already there) are taken up and she keeps on sowing starting in the next hole, unless <br/>     The last stone lands in an hole making a casa (four pieces).

This is the more simple one, the &quot;women's game&quot; (in fact, the girls' game).<br/><br/>The game begins with 2 seeds per hole. (In a 4x8 grid of holes with one of the longer sides facing each player.) On the first game the beginning player is chosen at random. On the following games, it alternates. <br/>Each player controls the two rows closer to her. <br/>Moves are multiple lap. <br/>On her turn the player takes all the seeds from a hole on her side and sows them one by one on the following holes on her side, on a counterclockwise sense. <br/>If the last seed of a lap is sown in an empty hole the move ends. <br/>If the last seed of a lap is sown in a hole not allowing a capture she takes all the seeds on this hole and keeps on sowing another lap. <br/>If the last seed of a lap is sown in a hole of the inner row and on the opponent's facing holes there are any seeds she captures them and sows them in another lap starting on the same hole the capturing lap started. <br/>If on her turn a player can not move (she has no seeds, or all of them are singletons) she has lost the game.&quot;<br/><br/>That is the basic game. An intermediate form is:<br/><br/>&quot;This is the middle (according to difficulty) one, the &quot;boys' game&quot;.<br/><br/>The game begins with a special position&quot; Thesame board as the above but with a non-uniform starting position. 17 seeds start in the pit at the bottom right corner for each player. The adjacent pit in the same row starts with 2 seeds as does each other pit in the same row thereafter. In the middle two rows, pits with an empty pit behind them (i.e., closer to the nearer player) start with 2 seeds and the hole diagonally next to the corner starts wth 1 seed on each side. Other pits start empty.<br/><br/>&quot;On the first game the beginning player is chosen at random. On the following games, it alternates. <br/>Each player controls the two rows closer to him. <br/>General rules<br/>General rules are as those of women's game. <br/>Moves are multiple lap. <br/>On his turn the player takes all the seeds from a hole on his side and sows them one by one on the following holes on his side, on a counterclockwise sense. <br/>If the last seed of a lap is sown in an empty hole the move ends. <br/>If the last seed of a lap is sown in a hole not allowing a capture he takes all the seeds on this hole and keeps on sowing another lap. <br/>If the last seed of a lap is sown in a hole of the inner row and in the opponent's facing holes there are any seeds he captures them and sows them in another lap starting on the same hole the capturing lap started. <br/>If on his turn a player can not move (he has no seeds, or all of them are singletons) he has lost the game. <br/>Overture<br/>At the beginning of the game some special rules apply. <br/>Both pits containing 17 seeds are called ng'hana (privileged pits). <br/>During the player's overture (each player overture can last differently) seeds are sowed only on his 14 left most holes, and the contents of the ng'hana can not be captured.<br/><br/>Once a player decides to (or must, as all other pits are empty or singletons) play the ng'hana his overture is over, he sows the seeds on the full board and all his seeds can be captured, from any pit. However, he can not capture the opponent's ng'hana as far as the opponent is still playing his own overture. &quot;<br/><br/>"}, "39480": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "K\u00e2ra", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"9": "Mancala"}, "average": "3", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"171": {"name": "(Public Domain)"}}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A mancala game.<br/><br/>From Mancala World:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href='http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/K%C3%A2ra' rel='nofollow'>http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/K%C3%A2ra</a><br/><br/>K&acirc;ra is a mancala game, which is played by the Bagara in Kordofan Province, Sudan, primarily during the fasting month of Ramadan. It was first described by R. Davies in 1925.<br/><br/>The counters are generally small balls of dried clay, called t&ucirc;b (&quot;bricks&quot;). A hole can become very full of balls, with the result that it is difficult to foresee the effect of moving its contents.<br/><br/>According to Davies:<br/><br/><br/>        this explains an otherwise obscure allusion to the celebrated Sheikh Musa M&acirc;dibbo, late nazir of the Rizeigat tribe, as bahr K&acirc;ra ghar&icirc;g - &quot;a deep sea of k&acirc;ra&quot;. The nazir's reputation was that he would sit in council with his sheikhs and elders, and would listen to all their opinions, but would not disclose his own, so that the result of the &quot;meglis&quot; was as unpredictable as that of moving the contents of a very full house at k&acirc;ra.<br/><br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>K&acirc;ra is rather unusual since it can be played by any number of players and seems to work very well when played by four. Each player owns three consecutive holes (called &quot;houses&quot;) and one store hole called makk&acirc;la (plural: mak&acirc;k&icirc;l). The playing holes are arranged in a circle with the mak&acirc;k&icirc;l in the center.<br/><br/>Each house has seven balls at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>The game is played in single laps and in a counter-clockwise direction.<br/><br/>If the move ends in an opponent's hole or in your own right-hand one, the player &quot;eats&quot; the contents of all enemy holes containing 2, 4 or 6 balls.<br/><br/>If a player can't move, he passes.<br/><br/>The game ends when nothing can be ever captured again. The winner is the person who captured most balls.<br/><br/>Although not stated by Davies, according to Ralf Gering it might be a good idea that diagonally opposite players must form a team to prevent unfair coalitions during the game.<br/><br/>"}, "39481": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Katro", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"9": "Mancala"}, "average": "6.33333", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"171": {"name": "(Public Domain)"}}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A mancala game.<br/><br/>From Mancala World:<br/><a target='_blank' href='http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Katro' rel='nofollow'>http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Katro</a><br/><br/>&quot;Katro is played by the Betsileo people in Fianarantsoa in the southern highlands of Madagascar.

The game plays an important role in the oral literature and it is said to be a game of peace because &quot;it can turn enemies into friends&quot;. On the 5th of January, 1999, the Government of Angola instituted the Pr&eacute;mio Kiela, a tournament which now offers prizes up to 1,500 US$ for the winner. <br/>The most important source on the game is a book by Bernardo Campos. Although he uses the name kiela (&quot;puzzle&quot;, &quot;mind game&quot;) both for the game itself and also for the kind of game (i.e., mancala) in a rather confusing manner, it was possible to extract the rules from it.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Kiela is played on a board made by four rows of ten holes. Each player controls the two rows closest to him. <br/>At the beginning there are two stones in each hole of the outer rows and two stones in each of the four right holes of the inner row of each player. <br/>For a beginners game it is suggested to start playing with just one seed per hole, instead of two, in the same holes.<br/><br/>At your turn you take all the stones from a hole belonging to your side of the board, which contains two or more seeds, and sow them anti-clockwise (i.e., you put one on each of the following holes, without skipping one, all around your two rows). For a beginners game, it is suggested that they can move even if there is a single stone. <br/>If the last stone lands in an empty hole, the turn ends. <br/>If the last stone lands in an occupied hole all these stones (the one just landed plus the ones that were already there) are picked up and you keep on sowing. <br/>     If this occupied hole is in the inner row and the opposite hole of the opponent is occupied, the stones of this hole are captured and you keep on sowing with them starting in the hole following the one that allowed you to capture. <br/>     If the outer hole of the opponent is also occupied, you capture also its stones, and sow with the stones from both opponent's holes. <br/>When a player cannot move (i.e., all his holes are empty or contain single stones), he has lost. For a beginners game, only if all his holes are empty, as they are allowed to move singletons. <br/>Expert players may, at their first turn, rearrange the stones on their side. &quot;<br/><br/>"}, "39483": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Kisolo", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"9": "Mancala"}, "average": "7.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"171": {"name": "(Public Domain)"}}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From Mancala World:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href='http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Kisolo' rel='nofollow'>http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Kisolo</a><br/><br/>&quot;Kisolo (also called Cisolo in Kasai) is played by the Luba, Lulua and Songye in the southeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo.<br/><br/>Kisolo appears to be related with Coro, a game played in Uganda. It also reminds of some games known in Eastern Africa and of Indian mancala games.<br/><br/>The wooden boards of the Luba are often adorned with human figures which is quite rare in this part of Africa. The holes are usually round, except in Shaba where they are sometimes quadratic. The seeds that are used in play are either from the ngola tree (Pictantus makombo) or from the menga (Canarium schweinfurtii).<br/><br/>Rules:<br/>Kisolo is mostly played on a 4 x 7 board, but smaller boards are also used such as 4 x 6 (see above). Each player only plays on the two rows which are closest to him.<br/><br/>Initially there are three seeds (makombo) in each hole.<br/><br/>If a player cannot capture, he starts his turn by emptying one of his holes and then distributes its contents one by one counterclockwise into the following holes. When he can't capture (see below), he makes a new lap by distributing the contents of the hole following the hole in which he dropped the last seed in hand. The move ends when the last hole is followed by an empty one.<br/><br/>It is either possible to capture before the actual move starts or during a move.<br/><br/>If, at the beginning of a turn, two inner holes (one from each player) opposite to each other contain seeds, the enemy seeds of the opposite hole and, if there are any, of the enemy hole of the same file behind it are picked up and then distributed counterclockwise on the own side. The first seed must be put into the hole which effected the capture. This kind of capturing is compulsory, but the player is free to decide from which holes he captures when he has more than one choice.<br/><br/>If the last seed falls into a non-empty hole and the following hole is in the inner row and contains seeds, the contents of the opposite enemy hole in the opponent's inner row are captured and also the seeds in the outer enemy hole just behind it. Again, the captured seeds are distributed on the player's own side, starting in the hole which effected the capture (that is, straight opposite the captured holes).<br/><br/>The player who captures all seeds of his opponent's inner holes is declared winner, no matter how many seeds his opponent still has in his outer row. The game is a draw, if a move doesn't end. Perpetual sowing occurs, for instance, if empty holes alternate with holes containing one seed, when at the beginning of the turn, no two inner holes opposite of each other have seeds.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "39484": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Kotu-baendum", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"9": "Mancala"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"171": {"name": "(Public Domain)"}}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From wikimanqala:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href='http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Kotu-baendum' rel='nofollow'>http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Kotu-baendum</a><br/><br/>Kotu-baendum (&quot;tying up the enclosures&quot;) is played in Sri Lanka.

The captures are collected in the store. <br/>If the contents of an end hole are captured, this hole is said to be &quot;tied&quot; (baenda). A baenda is owned by the player who effected the capture. A move or lap cannot start from a tied hole. When a player sows his last seed into a baenda, his turn ends and the player &quot;sits down&quot;. Any seeds sown into a tied hole are owned by the player who made the baenda. <br/>The game is finished when a player has nothing to move with at the start of his turn.

Hassaniya is an Arab dialect heavily influenced by Tamazigh, a Berber language, that originated in the 15th century. At this time the Yemenite Beni Hassan tribe migrated to north-western Africa and subdued the indigenous Berber tribes over a period of 300 years. Hassaniya is today spoken in the western Sahara, from Niger to Mauritania. They constitute the majority of the population in Mauritania and southern Morocco. The Hassaniya call this region Trab el Bidan, i.e. '&quot;Land of White People&quot;, in contrast to Bilal al Sudan, or &quot;Land of Black People&quot;. <br/>Um dyar is mostly played by young women, sometimes also by men. However, they do never play among themselves, just with women, for instance as a means of courtship. <br/>The game is played all the year, but especially on Ramadan and during the hot hours at noon time. <br/>Usually the holes are dug in the sand, but there are also traditional wooden boards. Some of them are made of one piece, while others consist of two halves. <br/>The holes are called dyar (sing.: dar, i.e. &quot;houses, inhabited places&quot;). The seeds are called ky&eacute;tan (sing.: kyit), probably related to kyit, Hassaniya for &quot;odd&quot;.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>The board is made of two rows of an even number of holes, between 2 and 12. <br/>The number of seeds which are initially in each hole depends on the size of the board. A board which numbers just four holes has four seeds in each hole. Board that have eight or twelve holes have as many seeds as the whole board numbers holes or, alternatively, just as many as one row numbers holes. Large boards which have 16 or 24 holes have initially in each hole as many seeds as a row counts holes.<br/><br/>Each player controls the holes on his side of the board. <br/>At his turn, a player takes the contents of any hole of his side of the board and sows them counterclocwise, one by one, starting in the very same hole from where he took them. <br/>     If you move a singleton, it is put into the next hole counterclockwise. <br/>If the last seed ends in a hole making a total of an even number of seeds, not greater than the initial number of seeds per hole, these seeds are captured and removed from the board. <br/>If you have captured, you also get the contents of the preceding holes (in an unbroken sequence) that contain an even number of seeds, not greater than the initial number of seeds per hole. <br/>If a player has no seeds to play with, he passes and his opponent plays again. <br/>The game ends when all seeds are captured. <br/>The player who has captured most seeds, wins the game. <br/>If at the end of the game a single seed remains (i.e. there has been some mistake or cheating), the players who has an odd number of captured seeds loses one seed. These two seeds (the lost one and the seed remaining on the board) are not counted.<br/><br/>Usually you don't play just a game, but a match. <br/>In the next game you start filling the holes with the captured seeds. <br/>The winner fills all his holes with the standard initial number of seeds. <br/>The looser fills all the holes he can with the standard number of seeds. If he some seeds remain, he puts them in another hole. <br/>     The empty holes on the looser's side of the board are refilled with sand or marked somehow. In the next game you don't play in them. <br/>     If the looser has not enough holes for his seeds, he reopens as many holes as he needs. <br/>     There is no fixed rule about the order to close or reopen the holes. Sometimes they are openend from left to right. However, it is not important. <br/>The winner of the match is who captures all the seeds and leaves the opponent with no holes on his side. <br/>If there was a couple of seeds out of game (as seen above) they are given to the first player who makes a capture in the next game.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "39486": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Krur", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"9": "Mancala"}, "average": "2", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"171": {"name": "(Public Domain)"}}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A manqala game.<br/><br/>From Wikimanqala:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href='http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Krur' rel='nofollow'>http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Krur</a><br/><br/>Krur (crur) is a game is played by Hassaniya (Moor) people.

This region is called Trab el Bidan, ie. land of white people, in contrast to Bilal al Sudan, or land of black people. <br/>Krur is mostly played by children. <br/>Usually the holes, which are called &quot;houses&quot;, are dug in the sand<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>The board is made of two rows of four holes. <br/>At the beginning, there are four seeds in each hole.<br/><br/>Each player controls the holes on his side of the board. <br/>On your turn you take all the seeds from any hole of your side of the board and sow them in an anticlockwise sense, one in each hole, starting in the next one. <br/>If you end in an empty hole, it is the end of your turn <br/>If the last seed lands in an occupied hole on the opponent's side, making a total of four seeds, you end your turn and this hole is captured by you. It is marked somehow. <br/>If the last seed lands in an occupied hole all these seeds (the one just landed plus the ones that were already there) are taken up and you keep on sowing starting in the next hole. <br/>You sow seeds in the holes you have captured but not in those captured by your opponent. <br/>You cannot start a sowing from a captured hole. <br/>The winner of the game is the one that, when there are no more seeds in play, has captured more than the opponent.<br/><br/>Usually you don't play just a game, but a match. <br/>On the next game you start filling the holes with the captured seeds. <br/>     The winner fills all his holes with four seeds. <br/>     The looser fills all the holes he can with four seeds. If he has some remaining seeds, he puts them in another hole, but always an even number of them, so he can retain a single seed. <br/>     The empty holes on the loser's side of the board are refilled with sand or marked somehow. In the next game nobody plays in them. <br/>     If the looser has not enough holes to put his seeds, he reopens as many holes as he needs. <br/>     There is no fixed rule about the order to close or reopen the holes. Sometimes they are opened from left to right. However, it is not important to the game. <br/>The winner of the match is the one who captures all the seeds and leaves the opponent with no holes on his side.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "39487": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Lahemay waladat", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"9": "Mancala"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"171": {"name": "(Public Domain)"}}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A manqala game.<br/><br/>From Wikimanqala:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href='http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Lahemay_waladat' rel='nofollow'>http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Lahemay_waladat</a><br/><br/>Lahemay waladat (&quot;my cow has given birth&quot;) is a mancala game widely known in the Maqal&eacute; area of southern Tig&eacute;, Ethiopia. The game was was first described by Richard Pankhurst in 1971 as Game 17. Similar games exist in Western Eritrea and Somalia.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Lahemay waladat is played on a board of two rows of of (sic) six holes. The game starts with four stones in each hole.<br/><br/>The right to start the game is decided by a hand-play referred to in Tigrinya as shekut. To begin with, the two players are holding hands as in a handshake. After breaking the hold, they would either expose the first finger, last three fingers or the open hand with fingers side by side. A player who displayed his first finger defeats one with three fingers, three fingers defeats the hand, and the hand the first finger. <br/>On his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes anti-clockwise, one at a time, into the succeeding holes. <br/>If the last stone is sown into an occupied hole, its contents are distributed in another lap. <br/>The move ends when the last stone falls into an empty hole. <br/>Groups of three stones made during a turn belong to the owner of the row, except a group of three that was effected by the last stone in hand which is won by the player whose hand it was. The latter kind of capture, however, does not terminate the move. The player would continue to move until his last stone in hand is placed in an empty hole (in other words, the player gets a bonus move). <br/>The game ends when a player cannot move at his turn. The remaining stones are won by the player who could move last. <br/>The player who wins more threes wins the round. <br/>For the next round each player fills his holes with four stones from his winnings. If a player has one surplus stone, he cedes it to his opponent who can then together with his own surplus of three stones would open another hole. If each player has a surplus of two stones, their ownership is decided by shekut. Any holes that could not be filled are closed down with sand, but can be re-opened in a later round. <br/>The aim of the game is to close down all the opponent's holes, that is to reduce his provision to less than four stones. &quot;<br/><br/>Pankhurst, R. 1971.

The board is dug in the ground and the pieces are dry camel dung called salo. Slightly different variants of the same game exist, among them a more simple game, which is promoted by the Somali ethnomathematician Jama Musse Jama in Italy.<br/><br/>The following rules were observed in 1931 by G. Marin in the area of Berbera, Somaliland, where it was (and probably still is) a favorite pastime of the Isaaq clan.<br/><br/>&quot;Layli Goobalay is played on a board that consists of two parallel rows of 12 holes on each side. A player controls the 12 holes on his side of the board.<br/><br/>[Holes all start with 4 seeds each.]<br/><br/>Each move a player empties the contents of one of his holes that is not an uur and distributes one ball in each of the following holes in a clockwise direction (as observed by G. Marin).<br/><br/>If the last ball is dropped in an occupied hole, the player takes its contents, including the last dropped ball, and continues to distribute the balls in a clockwise direction. The move ends if the last ball is dropped in an empty hole.<br/><br/>If the last ball is dropped into an empty hole on the player's own side, he captures this last ball together with the contents of the opposite hole if it contains one, two, four or more balls. A move which captures nothing is called abar (&quot;famine&quot;).<br/><br/>If the opposite hole contains three balls, one of these is put into the hole in which the last ball was dropped, so that each hole has two balls. These two holes now form an uur (&quot;pregnant&quot;), and both are owned to their creator. An uur may never be emptied by either player. Balls must be added to an Uur during the normal course of distribution. However, if the last ball is dropped into an uur, the move ends.<br/><br/>The game is over when one player has no legal move left. Each side then counts the balls he has captured together with the balls in his uurs and any balls remaining on his side of the board outside of uurs. Sometimes towards the end of the game the balls continue to circulate in a repeating pattern. Then the remaining balls are divided between both players as in Oware. The player who captures most balls wins.&quot;<br/><br/>Variant:<br/><br/>There is a similar game played on a 2x6 board in the south of Somalia, which is always played counterclockwise.

Twelve hollows are scooped in the board, in two rows of six each: in each hollow six balls are placed, and the opponents take each a row. The game is commenced by the first player taking out the balls from any one of the hollows, and distributing them, one by one, successively, round the board. In the first round no balls can be captured, but in the second the contest becomes serious. The skill of the player consists in so managing his distribution, that his last all shall either fall in a hollow where there is only one, or three, or seven, or nine &amp;c. which, by the addition of his ball, are made even numbers, and in consequence become prizes. If in the distribution he makes even numbers in the two last hollows, he takes the contents of both. This is considered a great stroke.

According to Metin And, a Turkish ethnologue, the game could be related to the &quot;mancala&quot; of The Arabian Nights (fifteenth night), one of the first literary accounts of mancala games. The game was depicted in Turkish paintings as early as in the 16th century. In Europe, it was first mentioned in 1694 by the English traveller Thomas Hyde. Mangala was also found by Edward Daniel Clarke in Balaklava, Crimea (now a suburb of Sevastopol) in 1801 and by Peter Emund Laurent on Chios Island (now Greece) in 1818. It might have influenced Mandoli (Hydra Island, Greece) and Ban-Ban (Bosnia). Mangala has almost the same rules as the Baltic German Bohnenspiel, which originated in Persia where it was known as Manqala or Manqalat.<br/>Two Ottoman Women playing Mangala (18th century)<br/><br/>The classic Mangala is still known in Turkey. However, the Mangala played in Gaziantep in Southeast Anatolia is not related to it at all, but is a close variant of La'b madjnuni (&quot;The Crazy Game&quot;), which was played in Damascus (Syria) in the late 19th century. More games called &quot;Mangala&quot; (again with quite different rules) are popular among the Bedouins in Egypt.<br/><br/>Mangala might be the first commercialized mancala game in a western country. A game called &quot;mangola&quot; (a common synonym for the Turkish Mangala at this time) was published by Jaques in England in 1863, after Walter Whitmore Jones claimed to have invented it. Jaques pattern book covering shows a thick wood board with two rows of six cells in which something like white beans are placed. The records of copyrights kept by the Stationers company, the Public Records Office at Kew, includes a volume covering 1862-64, which has an entry showing that the rules of Mangola were protected by copyright at that time. Richard Ballam, a board games collector, found an advertisement in the Illustrated London News (December 23, 1865) saying: &quot;Mangola, a new game. By the author of Squails, Frogs &amp; Toads etc. Wholesale Jaques &amp; Son&quot;. Claiming foreign or nearly forgotten boardgames as own designs happens frequently in the game industry. (...)<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>Mangala is played on a board, which consists of 12 holes dug into the earth.

It is known from the Virunga mountains to the Sudanese border, and from Bangui (Central African Republic) to Arui near Uganda. Mangola is a new game which was developed after 1911 according to the ethnologue Philip Townshend and is now gradually replacing older games such as sombi and single lap mancala games. The game was spread by the Belgian colonial administration and military along rivers and roads and is the only mancala game played in the central basin (one of the few African regions where mancala games were still unknown in the 19th century). <br/>There are many local variants, probably more than 30, which have slightly different opening rules (some with simultaneous opening moves) and employ different board sizes. <br/>The game is played by adults on beautiful wooden boards with holes carved in the surface. Children, on the other hand, dig the board in the ground or draw it with chalk on concrete. <br/>It is played by both sexes, but more often by women. <br/>The following rules were reported from the capital Kinshasa by Suzanne Comhaire-Sylvain in 1952.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Mangola is a two players game. <br/>It is played on a board made of four rows of eight holes. <br/>At the beginning each hole has two seeds.<br/><br/>Each player controls the two rows closer on his side, and only moves on these two rows. We will call the row closest to him outer row and the other one inner row <br/>Players take turns to move. <br/>The first move of each player is a special one: they redistribute the seeds by taking the contents of one hole and putting it into the next, and so one, until your side of the board is checkered with holes containing 4 seeds and empty holes.<br/><br/>The second move of each player must begin from the left- or right-most hole of your outer or inner row. <br/>At your turn you take all the seeds from a hole on your side that contains at least two seeds and put them, one by one, in the following holes, in an anticlockwise sense. Singletons cannot be moved. <br/>If the last seed is dropped in an empty hole, you move it to the next hole and your turn ends. <br/>If the last seed falls in a non-empty hole, you take its contents including the last distributed seed and keep on sowing. <br/>If the last seed falls in a non-empty hole of the inner row, and the two opposite holes of the opponent contain seeds, you take the contents of your hole, including the seed just dropped, and the contents of both opponent's holes, and begin the next lap from the hole following the last empty hole (the same from which you began the last lap that effected the capture). <br/>When one player cannot move (his side of the board is empty or contains only singletons), he has lost the game.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "39494": {"boardgamedesigner": {"11440": {"name": "Dumont T"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "DracoKrak Chess", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2676": "Grid Movement"}, "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic995740_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"8957": {"name": "RCC"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic995740.png", "boardgamefamily": {"4024": "Chess Games"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "DracoKrak Chess is a boardgame that is essentially Chess unleashed.
