World War II in the West was originally designed for play with Axis and Allies figures and rule, but is now a stand-alone game which includes over 1,600 counters. However, the rules and the hex sizes still allow Axis and Allies fans to get the most accurate World War II wargame they can find while still using the popular rules and pieces if they wish.<br/><br/>In fact, World War II in the West can be used effectively to bring Axis and Allies fans into the wargaming hobby as the game combines some of the features of Axis and Allies and conventional counter wargames to produce a new style of game that is simple yet complex, fun yet challenging.<br/><br/>With World War II in the West, you fight for the convoy routes, have air battles over London, conduct landing operations on the northern French coast, outflank and surround forces on the Eastern Front, and manage the industrial output of your nation.<br/><br/>World War II in the West includes over 1,600 counters depicting the armed forces of the major belligerents as well as informational counters needed to play the game. Along with the major nations, you can find in the counter mix Canadian, Australian, New Zealander, South African, Czech, Indian, and East African units, as well as the well-known Spanish Blue Division that fought on the Eastern Front with the German Army.<br/><br/>The beautifully hand-drawn map is made up of 12-pieces, totalling a size of 50 by 40 inches. Also included is a smaller East African map to be used in play. The map has all of the charts and boxes needed for game play and has a scale of approximately 150km per hex. The hexes are large enough to hold Axis and Allies pieces, but it is ideally played with the counters that are sized to decrease mess and accidents during play.<br/><br/>The game is best played with the grand campaign which runs from September 1939 until the end of 1945, in monthly and bi-weekly turns. Two scenarios are included with the game allowing you to play the war in Africa or Operation Overlord in a shorter time than the campaign game. Also, new scenarios will be posted on the website.<br/> World War II in the West&rsquo;s complexity is what sets it apart. It sets it apart from the other Axis and Allies games as the complexity is far greater and the history  more accurate. It also sets it apart from the conventional  counter wargames as its complexity is slightly more simple, yet still depicts the war accurately while being fun and challenging. This is not a simple game, but its complexity allows both experienced and beginner wargamers to understand the rules and enjoy the game.<br/><br/>World War II in the West can be combined with World War II in the East to play the entire global war, both games combining to use over 2,500 counters and 25 square feet of maps!<br/><br/>"}, "6659": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Harry Potter Casting Stone Game", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2001", "usersrated": "36", "boardgamefamily": {"5608": "Harry Potter"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic873271_t.jpg", "average": "3.99581", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"93": {"name": "Mattel"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic873271.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"34124": "Mattel starter game"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Essentially a board game version of &quot;Paper-Scissors-Rock,&quot; Casting Stones uses a &quot;Spells-Potions-Charms&quot; hierarchy for competition between players.

Each player also holds a pack of 9 yellow cards. one '+5', one '+3' one '+2' three '+1's, a spare wheel, a food musette (musette = In cycling, a bag containing food handed out in a feed zone of a multi-stage race such as the Tour de France) , and a 'Baraka'. (which means good luck in French slang.) On their turn the active player draws a random card for each of their racers, and if desired adds one of their yellow cards. Yellow cards are discarded for the stage after play. <br/>If a racer ends his move with one space between him and the player of his team ahead of him, then he can slip-stream into the space provided it is not filled by racers of other teams. A racer can also slipstream another team's racer if there is a completely empty road space between them. Roads are 4, 3 or two riders wide, depending upon the terrain.<br/>The winner can be decided by shortest number of turns taken to complete the course, or by placing in the finishing order of each stage - (better to agree this in advance). The short stages can take between 30 and 60 minutes, and the long stages 60 to 90. A lot depends upon the number of players, and of racers per team. If the whole race is to be run is would be best to spell it over a weekend with some other games filling between stages.<br/><br/>"}, "6696": {"boardgamedesigner": {"2399": {"name": "Anne C.

It is played with one or more decks of cards - I play with a shoe box of old, partly complete packs :)<br/><br/>There the similarities end:<br/><br/>1. If you only have one card left, you have to say 'Bartok'. If you don't, you get your hand made back up to maximum.<br/><br/>2. Most other rules violations require you to take one or more cards.<br/><br/>3. Players aren't allowed to ask questions during a game. Ask a question, take a card. This is most entertaining when someone comes along and asks 'What are you playing?'. They'll usually get a card, and then several more when they don't say Bartok.<br/><br/>4. This is the doozy: A player that successfully gets rid of his last card is deemed the winner for that round, and gets to make a new rule, which overrides any later rules. These can be as simple or as brain-hurty as you like. Usually the game gets harder as it progresses, as rules feed off each other and make lethal feedback loops.<br/><br/>5. Some example rules, to give you an idea of the flavor of the game:<br/><br/>When a change of suit changes color, play direction reverses. (easy)<br/>When a two is played, play skips a player. (easy)<br/>Threes don't exist. (somewhat metaphysical)<br/>When a black ace is played, each player must slap a card face down in the middle of the table. The last player to do so takes all of the other cards.

Allied players can fly the game's namesakes, the F4U-1 Corsair and F6F Hellcat, as well as the British Firefly, the P47-N, and the P-61 Black Widow. Japanese players can counter with two models of late war Zero, the Ki-84 Frank, the N1K1 George, and the J2M Jack. New bomber types include the TBF Avenger, the B-29 Superfortress, and the Ki-49 Helen. There's even a new kind of bomber: the Attack Bomber, which can strafe and bomb. Two types are present in Corsair &amp; Hellcats: the B-25C-1 field modification and the solid nose B-25J, which carried a dozen (!) fixed forward-firing .50 caliber machine guns.<br/><br/>All of these aircraft (plus many of the ones in Zero!) are used in seven new campaigns. Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz are carrier campaigns like those pioneered in Zero!. Solomon Islands, Philippines 1944, and Okinawa use the land campaign structure familiar to players of the previous games in the series. The other two campaigns are quite different, though. Guadalcanal models the drawn out struggle for control of the airspace above that island. Players allocate available aircraft to two missions each week in an attempt to force a withdrawal by their opponent. The campaign also includes the option to play the Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz campaigns as part of the battle, feeding the results of the carrier encounters back into the main campaign. B-29s in China is a solitaire campaign representing the beginning of the strategic bombing offensive against Japan. The player controls three Superfortresses and must balance their activities between training, carrying supplies, repairing damage, and conducting bombing missions.<br/><br/>In addition, Corsairs &amp; Hellcats includes new target types, skilled pilots, and ordnance. The game also has rules for Kamikazes, supply drops, submarines, and mine laying. There's even a new method of selecting skilled (and green) pilots and crews that reflects the changes in aircrew quality that both sides went through during the course of the war.

They follow the same format as our other rules used in the Trilogy, making them easy to follow for experienced gamers, and novices alike. Tactical turns represent 3 minutes, with intermediate turns (for long distance maneuvering and long stern chases) representing 30 minutes. Gun hit probability is based upon a combination of factors such as visibility, range, target size, number of rounds firing at the target, and speeds of the firing and target platforms. Damage is a function of the type of shell, number of barrels firing and armor of target, and is easy to calculate also. Blank ship forms allow the player to list all the ranges and damages of his ship's particular guns in advance, making it quick and easy to calculate both damage and hit probability. Critical damage is a function of the amount of damage taken last round vs. the amount of damage able to be taken. Critical hits typically scored against systems (engineering, bridge, steering or individual weapon amounts).<br/><br/>The 40+ scenarios include the well known &quot;biggies&quot; such as Jutland (broken into three parts, as well as the grand battle) and Dogger Bank, and many smaller engagements. Often there are variants given, covering important &quot;almosts&quot; and &quot;what ifs&quot;. All aspects are covered, with ships provided for the Japanese, Turkish, Austrian, and Russian navies as well as the British and German fleets.

Cashflow 101 is the first of several games created by Kiyosaki to reinforce the information in his books.<br/><br/>The board has two tracks: A &quot;Rat Race&quot; small circle where you only roll one die to advance, and a &quot;Fast Track&quot; where you roll two dice to advance. In the Rat Race you get paid for passing your Paycheck space, and then draw from one of four decks of cards depending on which space you've landed. Some of the deals are good, others are bad. Your main problem here is a shortage of cash. In the Fast Track your main problem is an excess of cash and finding investments to sink it into before you lose it to lawsuits, divorce or tax audits.<br/><br/>The heart of the game though are the player sheets where players learn how to fill out a financial statement. Players choose from a variety of starting careers (Truck Driver, Mechanic, Lawyer, Airline Pilot, etc.) and fill out their financial sheets appropriately. As they land cards and invest in different deals they dutifully log each change to their financial sheets as well. After a few games most people end up using the same financial sheets to fill out their own personal information.<br/><br/>With each card event the drawing player may buy at that price, but all players may sell at that price. Also, players may make co-investments with the drawing player or even buy the deal from him if they agree. Player deals are encouraged.<br/><br/>The game with few players is heavily biased towards real estate. With 5-6 players the cards are being drawn fast enough that the part time businesses pay off as well.<br/><br/>There are thousands of Cashflow 101 game clubs around the world.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"157114": "Czech edition"}, "name": "Cashflow 101", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "397", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "average": "4.98259"}, "6553": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic146669.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1206": {"name": "Christophe Boelinger"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2003", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"28205": "Arnaud Quere"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"157": {"name": "Asmodee"}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic146669_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"12253": "2003 Spiel der Spiele Hit f\u00fcr Zwei Recommended"}, "description": "Players each control a pack of 12 cats, and are trying to bring as many as possible to safety in the tree, escaping the dogs chasing them.

Munchkin Fu is completely compatible with the entire Munchkin line.<br/><br/><br/>Other<br/><br/>Part of the Munchkin series.<br/><br/>Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"213440": "English edition 2007, Version 1.3"}, "average": "5.91492", "name": "Munchkin Fu", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "1995", "boardgameaccessory": {"187880": "Munchkin: Blank Cards"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"5496": "Thematic Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"9470": "Asian Theme"}}, "6608": {"boardgamedesigner": {"21": {"name": "Christian T.

If you expand too fast without buying beehives, hire fishermen and  foresters you won&acute;t be able to maintain your landed properties. This is the time to build castles and mills as well. At the beginning of the next year a random event happens (such as plague, floods or robber barons coming to the valley).<br/>The optional rules add religion (you have to choose a religion and build churches or celtic stone circles) and honour, weather (which influences the harvest) and loyalty of your troops. <br/>Winner is the player who owns first 21 of the 40 fiefs or has the highest amount of honour after ten years of play (optional).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"76444": "Citadel edition"}, "average": "6.24751", "name": "Excalibur", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2689": "Action / Movement Programming"}, "age": "14", "usersrated": "277", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"3274": "King Arthur Series"}}, "6647": {"boardgamedesigner": {"2382": {"name": "Frederic Vester"}}, "average": "5.26774", "poll": {}, "name": "\u00d6kolopoly", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "yearpublished": "1983", "usersrated": "62", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1030497_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"47040": "Peter Schimmel"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1030497.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"214335": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1029": {"name": "City Building"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "HISTORY<br/><br/>Frederic Vester designed &Ouml;kolopoly in 1980 and it was first published as a supplement in the journal Nature.
