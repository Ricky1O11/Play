You do not need the latter product to enjoy this one, but owning both will enhance your enjoyment immensely!<br/><br/>Temerlyth, our infamous elven lich, was forced to spend his great personal fortune and energies building what has become a hidden lair, laboratory and base of operations.

Silvermote is a calamitous reflection of his nature and more.

Rights for the production of the game were given by the Kurosawa production, with character designs by French artist M&oelig;bius and the composition of the music by Ryuichi Sakamoto.<br/><br/>Seven Samurai 20XX is a re-telling of Seven Samurai in a futuristic setting. It takes various liberties with the original story to better suit the post setting and introduces anime and modern styled designs. The game follows seven samurai as they fight off an immense army of mutants, cyborgs and other inhuman creatures in an attempt to bring about a regime of peace for those in need. The player takes the role of Natoe, a samurai warrior, and is sent through various locations of post-Japan to fight off hundreds of enemies with a twin-sworded fighting style known as Nitou-Ryu.  And while the story is based on the film Seven Samurai, its story and plot have more in common with its animated counterpart, Samurai 7.<br/><br/>The year is 20XX and the setting is Japan. Humans and Humanoids, the latter being various mutants, cyborgs, and robots, maintain a delicate balance in a large, unnamed city (somewhat resembling a post-apocalyptic Tokyo) where the power and balance of the city is maintained by a large structure known as the Steeple of light. Its source of power is a young girl named the Child of Heaven. When the child is stolen by the humanoids in order to break the balance and initiate war, the child then goes missing from her inhuman captors and is held by several villagers to ransom the city for money. When the humanoids and various Agents of the city set out to retrieve her and her Sacred Jewel, the villagers quickly find themselves in danger and look for Samurai (known in the game as &quot;hunters&quot;) to protect them.<br/><br/>Seven Samurai 20XX is a hack and slash video game, as the protagonist of the game is faced with the task of destroying overwhelming hordes of enemies with his swords. Like many others of its genre, it utilizes a combo system, showing the player how many uninterrupted hits they have inflicted upon their opponents.<br/><br/>The main point of the game is to constantly utilize the second sword which is carried in the protagonist's shealth, allowing the player to achieve a larger combo score. Skill-related battle commands such as the Nitou-Ryu mode which allows the player to wield a second katana for a limited time, increase the speed, range and power of the players combos.<br/><br/>Nitou-Ryu mode is a duration of time engaged when the player presses the L1 and R1 triggers on the PlayStation 2 controller. It permits the protagonist to use a second blade for a limited amount of time to increase attack power and range of the weapons. As the player progresses in the game, the length of the bar can be increased.<br/><br/>A Just guard allows the player to deflect an enemy's attack with skillfully timed uses of the triangle button. It allows the player to avoid damage and generates a counter-attack opportunity. This move also fully refills the Nitou-Ryu timer to 100% of its capacity.<br/><br/>A Just Step is executed with proper timing of the X button and allows the player to avoid an enemy's attack and &quot;step&quot; (in game, it looks more akin to a teleport) behind the enemy for a counter-attack. This move partially refills the Nitou-Ryu timer. An Just attack allows Natoe to travel in the direction of one or more enemies at great speed, breaking their defense. This move also partially refills the Nitou-Ryu meter. The game also incorporates various Street Fighter-like combos and &quot;Charge attacks&quot; which occur when holding the square button at various combos and when dashing with the X button.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Seven Samurai 20XX&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "121556": {"rpgartist": ["Olli Hihnala"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Love of Money", "rpgdesigner": ["Matthew Sanderson"], "rpgproducer": ["Beth Lewis", "Simon Rogers"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1673522.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["The Esoterrorists"], "rpgpublisher": ["Pelgrane Press"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Crime (Criminal / Law Enforcement)", "Occult"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1673522_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Six months ago, Ordo Veritatis agent John Sheldon went off the organisations radar following an emotional breakdown in the wake of loosing his wife in a car crash.

You do this by (unfairly to me and my friends) bagging Zombies.  For those of you who are not strong enough (or too lazy) to bag Zombies on your own, you can hire a Big Damn Hero, or BDH, to bag Zombies for you.  You and your BDH use whimsical Zombie killing weapons crafted from the meager resources left after the apocalypse, often modifying them with unusual items to make them inflict more damage on us (innocent) Zombies.<br/><br/>As if weapons weren&rsquo;t enough, you use Action Plans to help you achieve your goal, often using those same Action Plans to place traps on us poor, unsuspecting Zombies.  I can&rsquo;t be too upset, however, if you&rsquo;re trapping us to prevent other survivors from killing us.  I also fully support your use of Reality Checks to mess with the other pesky survivors&rsquo; plans.<br/><br/>So if you dare to challenge me, Lord Dead &lsquo;N Buried, go ahead and try.

Two playing surfaces for the more complex games, approximately 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; with game instructions make the Full set into an Advanced Game of Astromino.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Astromino Game Play Basics<br/><br/>     To start the game &ldquo;Big Bang&rdquo; the tiles, i.e. shuffle or mix them face down on a large table top to form the &ldquo;Galaxy&rdquo;. Now choose a tile to determine who starts the game. The player with the highest double tile will be the starter. Once the starter is determined the other players return the tile to the Galaxy as the starter places his double to start the game.<br/>     Now each player will choose their own hand from the Galaxy, 5 Kites and 5 Darts. Each contestant plays one tile per turn from their hand of ten tiles, matching like numbers on the tiles, long edges to long edges and short to short. The basic game continues as a string of connected shapes the Moon and the Star take shape. These shapes Moon and Star must be formed using 5 Kites or 5 Darts, respectively. The shapes are assembled and connected, one to another as the game proceeds. The string of shapes undulates and forms the line of play, always a unique field of play. Like Domino games a typical hand in an Astromino game will last between 15 and 25 minutes.<br/>     Tiles may fit here or there and need to be turned and matched in your head as you choose your next move. Careful don&rsquo;t make an &ldquo;Anti-matter&rdquo; move or if caught you will lose your turn! Strategy comes into play as you make plans for your next move to defeat your favorite opponent(s).  Hide your tiles using the Player Tray.<br/>     If you are lucky maybe you can &ldquo;Shoot the Moon&rdquo;, it is a play where you complete any shape and clear your hand by playing two (2) or more tiles all at once. Astromino rules include many options so you can choose from them and play the game as you like it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Game Options<br/><br/>     There are six diferent games each one can incorporate these options to some degree.  Play options include Rule of Seven, Blank is a wild to play, Add a Shape,  Shoot the Moon, and scoring sevens or just scoring tile values with extra points for completing a shape.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Winning the Game<br/><br/>     Although optional scoring rules are included, the main goal of the game is to use all the Astromino tiles in your hand. When you are down to your last Astromino tile yell &ldquo;ASTEROID!&rdquo; Fair warning to the opponents you are about to defeat. You win the hand when all your tiles are played. You win the game when you win two hands.  Maybe you will be lucky enough to &ldquo;Shoot the Moon&rdquo; for the win.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Six Unique Games in one!<br/><br/>     Basic Line of Play Game<br/>     Moons and Stars Game<br/>     Sun, Earth and Moon Game<br/>     Sumerian Sevens and Twelves Game<br/>     Freeform Penrose Tiling Game<br/>     Four-Stage-Star Game<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "121606": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Scott Moeller"], "poll": [], "name": "Pitch It!", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Line Drawing", "Paper-and-Pencil", "Storytelling", "Voting"], "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2493451_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["MoeFamilyFun"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2493451.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Party Game"], "age": "13", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Pitch It! - Who's Got the Million Dollar Idea? is a dynamic and social game requiring blissfully creative nonsense, but also a keen eye and sharp ear for what&rsquo;s marketable.

The cards are laid out face down on the table. Each player chooses cards and stacks them until they receive a Live card, in which case their turn is up. If a player pulls an Arrest card, their stack of cards go into Jail, only to be redeemed by a player who pulls a Sober card. If a player pulls an Overdose, all their cards go to The Grave, never to be played again. Players can choose to redeem their Sober cards whenever on their turn they wish, but the longer they wait, the more they risk having their own cards sent to Jail or the Grave.

The game will have multiple types of scenarios, including exploration of wrecks on the seafloor, adventures in ancient cities of cyclopean structures, battles among fields of geothermal chimneys, submarine boardings among others. Adventures within flooded tunnels inside wrecked ships or crumbing cities may be played with &ldquo;tiles&rdquo; to represent stretches of passage and chambers, while games in open environments are played with scenic terrain pieces on the tabletop.<br/><br/>OPPOSING FORCES<br/><br/>This shadowy sea holds powerful artifacts from a long disappeared civilization, and the Fortune Hunters' have staked their claim to these treasures, modifying some of the technology they have already recovered to design advanced diving suits and weapons for underwater defense. They are not alone in their quest though, as other forces compete for the same artifacts.<br/><br/>The enigmatic 'Dark Mariners', remnants of the noble lost civilization, have completely devolved, mixing their bloodline with the foulest of undersea life and twisted ether technology to create vicious biomechanical creatures. These forces cruise the depths, carried within monstrous vessels that resemble gigantic sea creatures, gathering artifacts to help them prepare for an assault on the surface lands.<br/><br/>The 'Ancients of Atal&aacute;n' are the most advanced of all of the forces, for they are the last of the pure relatives of the lost civilization of the Ancients of the Shadow Sea. They are a small group, with a hidden undersea city many leagues away to the North, and have traveled under the ice to recover the technology of their lost kin follow them into the dimensional void.<br/><br/>Other forces will be included in the game, but the three main forces will be the focus of this Kickstarter project and will be the first ones to get miniatures.<br/><br/>GAME FEATURES<br/><br/>     Intense combat in the abyssal depths of the Sea. Breach submarines, uncover undersea temples, and dodge torpedoes while recovering artifacts that hold the secrets of the ethereal void.<br/>     Combination of 28mm scale miniature tabletop wargame with campaign advancement and a role-playing flavor. Players may customize their warband with different weapons and ether technology items as they become more experienced in battle.<br/>     Miniature starter sets for each of three main forces, Fortune Hunters, Dark Mariners, and Ancients of Atal&aacute;n will be produced. Sets will include five miniatures with stat cards and quickstart rules. Other forces are included in the rules and will be made into miniatures as funds permit.<br/>     Rulebooks will be available printed in full color or as downloadable PDFs, and will include multiple game scenarios and a painting guide. There will be a softcover version of the printed book, meant for retail store sale, and a hardcover version with some additional content for direct sale. If project goals are exceeded, we will produce additional miniatures, terrain and supplements and continue growing the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "121627": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Les myst\u00e8res du cacao", "playingtime": "50", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Promotional Board Games"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1557982_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Nestl\u00e9"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1557982.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "50", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Travel", "Trivia"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "50", "description": "The game is a journey on a world map that indicates the important places in the production of Cocoa.<br/><br/>In his turn player roll the dice, move around the board and will be asked questions about Cocoa!<br/><br/>The first player to collect enough bean-cards for correct answers is the game.<br/><br/>"}, "121628": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Kresimir Babic"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Gods of Fantasy", "playingtime": "50", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Deck / Pool Building", "Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1282770_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Kresimir Babic"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1282770.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "50", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Card Game", "Fantasy"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "50", "description": "Introduction<br/><br/>&quot;Gods of Fantasy&quot; is a card game that puts you in control of fantasy creatures.

(Soldiers of Chaos, Anarchy &amp; Rebellion).<br/><br/>Six of the world's top ten elite fighting forces are represented among the members of the Team: the Russian Spetsnaz, the French Naval Commandos, Israel's Shayetet 13, the U.S. Army Airborne Rangers, U.S. Marine Special Operations Command and the U.S. Navy SEALs.<br/><br/>Choose your side: one player controls Zulu 6 while the other controls S.C.A.R. The objects of the game: During each mission, Zulu 6 must use their elite combat skills to complete 2 mission objectives. S.C.A.R. must stop them with the use of overwhelming forces.<br/><br/>The game begins with the Zulu player choosing 3 of the 6 team members as his/her first assault team while S.C.A.R. player builds the game board by laying out 4 inch map tiles printed with a dirt path cutting through a jungle, placing each tile so that the path is continuous until the line of sight ends in a curve or a 3-way &quot;T&quot;. As the Zulu 6 team moves along the path, the S.C.A.R. player continues to build it. Some of the map tiles contain hazards designed to slow the Zulu 6 team members while others contain mission objectives such as a prison camp, a weapons facility and a downed spy plane. There are also map tiles that contain symbols that allows the S.C.A.R. player to place a number of his troops in that tile to keep Zulu 6 from completing its mission. The S.C.A.R. player also has the ability to spawn more troops to keep the danger moving.<br/><br/>Combat between the 2 armies is resolved using 6-sided dice (D6). Each Zulu 6 team member has a stat card that explains his special skill and lists how many attack dice he gets during combat as well as areas to keep track of ammunition spent during combat (10 slots) and wounds taken (3 slots). Each time a Zulu 6 team member attacks, a marker is moved 1 space along his ammo track. The same happens when a team member takes a hit. Every roll of 5 or 6 on a Zulu 6 die roll is a kill. Each S.C.A.R. trooper only gets 1D6 and a roll of 6 on the die is a wound on the target Zulu 6 team member.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, Zulu 6 races to achieve mission objectives as S.C.A.R. sends wave after wave of troops at them. All the while, Zulu 6 receives 5 mission points for each objective achieved and for each S.C.A.R. troop killed and may use these points in trade for special actions such as healing a wound, an extra attack die, an ammo drop to reload weapons or even to call in reinforcements if a Zulu team member is lost in combat.<br/><br/>There are 3 missions to complete that make up the core game, each with 2 objectives.<br/><br/>With expansions coming soon featuring different mapped environments, daring missions, and new team members, you can take Zulu 6 around the world battling the evil forces of S.C.A.R.<br/><br/>"}, "121651": {"poll": [], "name": "Crash Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Game Boy Advance edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Crash Bandicoot"], "videogametheme": ["Cute Fantasy"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Vicarious Visions"], "videogamefranchise": ["Crash Bandicoot"], "videogameplatform": ["Game Boy Advance"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Vivendi Games"], "description": "Crash Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced, released in Japan as Crash Bandicoot Advance 2: Gurugurusaimin Dai Panic!?

Much of the game takes place in a dimensional bubble that Crash and his mentor Aku Aku are trapped in. The inside of the bubble is displayed as a map littered with portals to different levels. Connecting the portals are dotted lines which Crash can use to travel between portals; initially, only a few dotted lines are visible. The goal of each level is to find and obtain any Crystals and Gems hidden in the area. As more Crystals are retrieved from the levels, more dotted lines will become visible on the map, allowing for further exploration. Gems allow access to special levels necessary for full completion of the game. When the antagonists of the game have been defeated and enough Crystals have been gathered to return to Earth, the game is won.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Crash Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "121652": {"poll": [], "name": "Cubit", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Amstrad CPC edition", "Spanish Amstrad CPC edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Board Game"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Amsoft"], "videogamegenre": ["Classic Games"], "videogameplatform": ["Amstrad CPC"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Amsoft", "Indescomp"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A computer implementation of the classic game Connect 4, played on a 3D grid (4x4x4).

Context-sensitive interactions now require only a single button press when prompted, and bringing up the in-game menu for common interactions no longer pauses the game. Important items remain in the inventory after restarting a scenario.<br/><br/>The &quot;sightjack&quot; system has been improved by allowing the player to automatically sightjack nearby enemies. Character-specific features have also been incorporated, such as Shu Mikami's ability to move while sightjacking due to his near blindness, Ikuko's ability to control sightjacked enemies, and Akiko's ability to reveal psychic impressions when sightjacking in certain areas.<br/><br/>In contrast to the mainly stealth-based tactics of the previous game, players can now freely choose between stealth and action. The new combat system introduces a three-hit combo attack. Characters are also able to attack barehanded (although extremely weak and only effective to repel attackers in order to run away). Characters may also use guns as melee weapons. Many more weapons are available for each character, with many of them being improvised.<br/><br/>The shibito are slightly faster, more aggressive, and more intelligent than they were previously. However, they are still just as easy to distract from their usual habits.

They are also repelled by light, meaning that they can be weakened by focusing a flashlight on them or turning on the lights in a room. Like the shibito, a yamibito can be defeated, but is revived when a yamirei (\u95c7\u970a yamirei, lit. &quot;darkness spirit&quot;) re-enters the corpse. Eliminating the yamirei (which are also intolerant to light) renders the yamibito unconscious indefinitely. However, due to their improved intelligence and strength, yamibito will not fall for distractions that may have worked on shibito, and they are also much harder to defeat in combat.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Forbidden Siren 2&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "121725": {"poll": [], "name": "Highway Encounter", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Amstrad CPC Cassette edition", "English/European Amstrad CPC Floppy Disk edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2844098.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Highway Encounter"], "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Vortex Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Action"], "videogameplatform": ["Amstrad CPC"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Vortex Software"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2844098_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>An action game in isometric 3D.

These problems may be of bodily, social and/or mental nature. To solve these issues, there are numerous solutions (or at least approaches) and helpful people covering all aspects &ndash; bodily, social and mental.<br/><br/>This easy to pick up, educational yet fun-to-play card game tries to recreate these aspects of our living reality in a more or less abstract manner. The game should be a cooperative experience, in which not one is declared winner and the others losers in the end. Not selfishness and only striving for one&rsquo;s own benefit, but rather helping each other should pave the road to victory. All players win TOGETHER. Nobody should be left behind. Thus the name of the game!<br/><br/>In &quot;Together we are strong!&quot; players cooperate to solve their problems or problems of other players by playing &quot;solution&quot; cards which can be boosted by &quot;helper&quot; cards. At the beginning of his or her turn, the active player draws cards from a shared 60 card deck containing problems, solutions and helpers. For each problem a player solved on his or her own, he or she receives two smiley-chips (Victory Points). If players work together to solve a problem, each player involved gets one smiley-chip. When the draw deck is depleted, all players must have reached a minimum of smiley-chips / Victory Points (depending on the number of players) in order to win the game. If one or more players have not reached that goal, everyone loses.<br/><br/>Developed by a studied social worker, this game is ideal for social workers and other people working in the social sector as well as for people/families who have experience with psychosocial problems, while still providing a pleasant gaming experience for other interested gamers as well.<br/><br/>Fran&ccedil;ais :<br/><br/>L&rsquo;UNION FAIT LA FORCE !<br/><br/>Un jeu de probl&egrave;mes et de solutions, pour 2 &agrave; 4 joueurs.<br/><br/>Nos vies quotidiennes regorgent de probl&egrave;mes de toutes natures, psychologiques, relationnels ou physiques, de sorte qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;est pas toujours facile de conserver notre &eacute;quilibre et notre confiance en nous.

Then, after being told to leave immediately from the area by Shodi (The main client) to Vietnam, Exotic Imports then learns of the CIA being involved after the Russians track 2 KG of Weapons Grade Plutonium.

It is the fifth racing game in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, following Sonic Drift, Sonic Drift 2, Sonic R and its predecessor, Sonic Riders.<br/><br/>Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity was only available on the PlayStation 2 and Wii video game systems. The PS2 version was not released in Japan. A sequel titled Sonic Free Riders was released on November 4, 2010 exclusively for Kinect on Xbox 360.<br/><br/>The Story is split into two halves, the Heroes Story (Team Sonic), and Babylon Story (Babylon Rogues). Although the stories start separately, they overlap each other, telling the story as the main characters within that story see it. Following the format of Sonic Riders, Babylon Story also includes an epilogue that expands past the Heroes Story.<br/><br/>Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles are alerted to robots that are attacking a famous city of the future. They set out to retrieve a legendary artifact that has the ability to control gravity. Along the way they discover surprises, including the Babylon Rogues, a group of avian thieves who are also after the artifact. This sets off a war to decide who gets the artifact, leading them to settle their dispute by having an Extreme Gear competition.<br/><br/>This game introduces many new abilities in addition to ones from the first game. By gaining gravity points through tricks and technical challenges, players will enter a zero-gravity zone and be able to perform new moves.<br/><br/>The first is the Gravity Dive, which sucks the player towards a black hole further down the track, giving them a speed boost which tosses cars and other objects off the track and into the air which characters are able to smash into to gain more speed, and Gravity Control, which changes the gravity of the course, allowing the player to use a different track, such as one of the walls.<br/><br/>Also in the game is a move called Gravity Drift. This move is similar to the Grip move in Sonic Riders in which it can help characters turn on tight corners.<br/><br/>Items can offer help the player, such as an attack boost, or cause hardships, such as a ball-and-chain that hooks on your gear and slows your speed down.<br/><br/>There is a new method in the game called &quot;Gear Change&quot;. Once you gain a certain amount of rings, your gear will gain an upgrade. Each gear has from zero to three upgrades and can be upgraded during a race. Some upgrades include modifying your Extreme Gear's look or top speed. There are many different board types to use as well, adding for many options for customization.<br/><br/>In Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity, there are three new modes added to the game: Survival Mode, Survival Relay, and Survival Ball. Survival Mode entails each player to pick up missiles, then lock on and launch them at foes with Gravity Control, the winner being the last person standing. Survival Ball mode is, simply put, a soccer game on Extreme Gear. In Survival Relay, 2-4 players make a team of two and do a relay, with Extreme Gear as the baton.<br/><br/>There are a total of 16 courses in the game, eight worlds with two tracks in each. The tracks appear in the order they appear in the story mode.<br/><br/>Megalo Station/Nightside Rush<br/>    Botanical Kingdom/Snowy Kingdom<br/>    MeteorTech Premises/MeteorTech Sparkworks<br/>    Aquatic Capital/Tempest Waterway<br/>    Gigan Rocks/Gigan Device<br/>    Crimson Crater/Security Corridor<br/>    Astral Babylon/Mobius Strip<br/>    80's Boulevard/90's Boulevard<br/><br/>Each different type of gear has their own special advantages.<br/><br/>Boards with the Grind upgrade and Skates are able to use the Grind Rails as a shortcut. Although boards must install the Grind upgrade themselves, Skates can already Grind from the start. Besides this, they are predominant in speed, and usually have no other functions.<br/><br/>Air Riders and Yachts are able to use the Launch Ramps as a shortcut. Although Air Rider Gears usually come with no special advantages, the Yacht Type Gears can ride on drafts, which is completely different from Turbulance. By tailgating an opponent, a Yacht will gradually speed up to the point where they pass the opponent. However, their major drawback is that without a draft, Yachts are very slow, generally below 130 MPH.<br/><br/>Bikes and Wheels are able to smash obstacles to create new pathways. Although most Bikes don't come with any additional advantages, Wheels come with a major advantage of the ability to drift.<br/><br/>Some Gears have no Gear Parts, but usually come in the form in the other Gears listed above. However, sometimes, they have extra abilities that help you proceed in the race. For instance, the Money Crisis Gear is a Wheel Type that has no extra upgrades, but increases speed for the more rings you collect.<br/><br/>The Chaos Emerald Gear is a unique gear that can only be used by Sonic. It can only be obtained after you complete all of the missions with an Extreme rank. The Chaos Emerald has no initial Skill and uses rings instead of GP. However, using Gravity Moves consumes rings during at an extremely high rate. When Sonic's rings run out, he reverts back to regular Sonic, and is forced to run the track on foot until he obtains some rings. Before obtaining 60 Rings, the Chaos Emerald Gear is just basically Super Sonic on the Blue Star. When Sonic obtains 60 or more rings, he activates his &quot;Super Sonic Boost&quot;. In this state, Sonic gets off his board and flies around the track in a comet form. At this time, ring consumption is increased, but Super Sonic flies at 180 MPH and he is practically invincible to all attacks.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "121795": {"poll": [], "name": "The Sopranos: Road to Respect", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Australian PlayStation 2 edition", "North American PlayStation 2 edition", "UK PlayStation 2 edition"], "average": "6", "videogametheme": ["Crime"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["7 Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure", "Beat 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Home Box Office", "THQ"], "description": "The Sopranos: Road to Respect is based on the HBO series The Sopranos, which aired from January 10, 1999 to June 10, 2007.

Plankton, and must guide them through nine levels of play in a dreamworld. Four different types of gameplay have been incorporated into the game, known as flying; rampaging; racing and platforming. During flying sections the game sets obstacles one in front of another, and the player must maneuver past them. In most cases, the game will tell the player which way to fly (up, down, left and right). On the Wii, you use the controller like an actual plane control stick. The most common cases of this is when SpongeBob uses his plane to attack a giant-sized Plankton. In rampage levels the player controls a giant sized Plankton and uses special powers and moves to destroy everything in their path. The player's laser's power is indicated by a bar on the right side of the screen, which refills after use. The Wii version features controller movements that respectively activate moves. Racing gameplay is similar to most racing games; it is featured in both the air and the ground's gameplay, fuel must be collected in order to keep the player's vehicle running.

But your race is not alone in its aspirations for dominance of the cosmos, or in having the power to realize that goal. Races hailing from various star systems venture out in all directions. Many paths are dead ends, but some sectors have sizable deposits of rare minerals that can be refined into the precious fuel crystals that drive your space fleets onward. Soon, a trail of colonies leads out from your homeworld, and soon the races venture into the same cosmic regions. Don&rsquo;t get too attached to your fleets or interstellar empire, because tides can and will turn quickly. Only you can determine the fate of your people: interstellar conquest or infinite servitude.<br/><br/>StelCon: Infinity is a light strategy war game on a galactic scale. 2-6 players can expect around 30-45 minutes per player, so 2 players can often power through a game in about an hour. The 6 player game is kept short by combining into 3 teams of 2 where the teammates execute their turns simultaneously.<br/><br/>Variable game board. There are 6 races to choose from, each with its own strengths. Although the jump lanes that connect the sectors forming the galactic map are printed on the game boards, each sector location is covered by a different card from the sector deck each game.<br/><br/>Sectors are drawn from the deck and placed as the players explore the galaxy, so you never know what you're going to get...unless you do some scouting with your fighter squads or happen to have some telepaths on board your ship (telepaths are handy that way). Some of the sector cards are identical and therefore also create a &quot;bridge&quot; which is a unique adjacency in addition to the normal jump lanes. All this makes for a very different board every time.<br/><br/>Moving your space fleet around is straight forward. Each ship can move 1 sector per turn, plus 1 extra sector per turn per engine MOD. Your space ships are modular in design, both from a gameplay and a literal perspective. You physically insert engines, extra guns, and fighter squads into holes in the space ships. We call these MODs.<br/><br/>Combat is simple but tense. Add up your firepower present at the battle site and then toss in a d6 roll. The opponent does the same. Compare the two totals, and the winner keeps the sector in question while the loser retreats and loses a ship from his fleet.<br/><br/>While the game is a conquest type game, it ends immediately when one player conquers any homeworld, so there's no eliminated player stuck waiting around for the game to finish.<br/><br/>Conquest cards are the soul of the game. The deck of 120 cards gives tons of gotcha moments, and serious replay value. They allow you to do all sorts of fun things:<br/><br/><br/>     Modify the firepower of your sector or your ship<br/>     Boost fuel crystal production (the economy of the game)<br/>     Steal or stop opponent's cards<br/>     Cheat the dice<br/>     Wipe out a whole sector<br/>     Even influence battles your forces are not involved in, adding an element of table-talking diplomacy to the game<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "age": "13", "name": "StelCon: Infinity", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Point to Point Movement"], "average": "6.3", "usersrated": "32", "boardgamefamily": ["4X games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "121814": {"poll": [], "name": "Fact or Crap Card Game", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Memory"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "13", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1699411_t.jpg", "average": "4.76923", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Spin Master Ltd."], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1699411.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Travel", "Trivia"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>Travel Edition<br/><br/>Take your facts and your crap on the road!

A similar trait follows the homeless, who travel the streets picking through garbage for any recyclable materials to sell.

A group of survivors will often find a Rag and Bone Man as a welcome sight as they can potentially barter with them in order to fi nd any supplies that the survivors themselves have been unable to find. Less scrupulous people would rob the Rag and Bone Man, but this would be akin killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.

It uses a 4&times;4-holed board, and balls in three colors (white, black, and red).<br/><br/>Aim: Score the most points you can, without losing the game by disconnecting a white or a black the others of its kind.<br/><br/>Setup: The 4&times;4 board starts with the 16 base holes filled as shown to the right.<br/>The game is played from the 3&times;3 level up.  Empty the bag, and put 5 balls of each color (white, black, and red) into the bag.<br/><br/>Rules: Draw a ball from the bag, and add it to the pyramid according to these rules:  When there are no free spaces on a level, you may place the ball on any edge point of the new level; otherwise, you must push a ball from the side with a new ball.  White and black balls must end up touching others of their kind; red needn&rsquo;t do this.  If a white or black becomes stranded, you lose.  You may not push balls off the pyramid.<br/><br/>Once the last ball is on the pyramid, you score according to the following:<br/>7 points for a visibly connected path of red from corner to corner; otherwise, red is worthless.<br/>A color (black or white) that is split into separate visible groups is worth the product of the number of balls in each visible group of that color.<br/>A color (black or white) that is in one contiguous visible group is worth negative the number of balls in that visible group.<br/> Random Setup: Start with the two red balls in the corner, then put 11 white and 11 black in the bag.  Spiral clockwise inward from one of the reds, drawing a ball from the bag and adding it to the board.  Now spiral clockwise inward again from the same red, and each time you reach a white or black that is not touching any others of its kind, replace it with the other kind from the bag.  (Apologies for the difficulty in replacing the center four!)  Note:  The base may thus contain more groups than just one white and one black.<br/>After setup, dump the bag, and put the usual 5 white, 5 black, 5 red in the bag to start the game.<br/>When playing with random setup, you should play several games in a row with the same setup, so you can really experience the setup.<br/><br/>Multi-player Solitaire: Any number of people can compete, as long as each person has a Shibumi set.  If you do a random setup, everyone should copy one random setup, so everyone starts with the same base.  If players can see each others&rsquo; pyramids, each player should draw randomly from her own bag during the game; if players cannot see each others&rsquo; pyramids, you can have one person draw from her bag the whole game, announcing the color drawn, and the other players simply pull out that color and place it.

The age of Ancient Greece was frought with peril, sacrifice and prayer. To get anything done, people would pray to the gods for favor. To complicate matters, the right prayer had to reach the right deity in order to have any chance at success. It was very confusing and complicated life. To simplify this vast set of choices a Greek everyman or everywoman would face, I have chosen two paths that you and your opponents must set your sights towards. Order and Chaos, both are neutral, they are not bad or good in the classical sense, but rather a point of view. By the end of the first players turn, each player must align with Order or Chaos and build their strategies and play their cards towards that means.<br/><br/>Goal:<br/>Each player draws cards that move players towards your final goal of 21 culture points. Each action, each king, queen, god, monster, philosopher, literally each card can either add or subtract culture points, cause mayhem, deny abilities, outright kill foes, or otherwise meddle towards your cause or to take an opponent away from their cause, for your chosen faction (Order or Chaos). There is one initial turn to set up and identify which faction, Chaos or Order, you will be gaining points towards and then there are 4 turns, one per season: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter. If a player does not reach 21 culture points, at the final play of Winter, the player with the highest amount of culture points WINS!<br/><br/>Game-Play:<br/>Players will determine who goes first and will draw (and play) cards in the correct slots (Gods, Titans, Stars, etc.) and each card will have passive and active effects that resolve at the end of each player's turn. There is a (normal sheet of paper size) game board that shows where different cards &quot;live&quot; Passive effects will usually be &quot;Add one culture point towards either Order or Chaos&quot; (depending on the Card's Alignment). Active effects (or action cards) will require using action points (each player gets 5 action points per turn; the game has 4 turns total, so each play and card management is very important) that can alter the landscape of the game and change fates FAST.<br/><br/>Unique Feature (Stacking):<br/>Say a certain God card is played (let's say Zeus) and he is Chaos aligned. And say there is a chaos aligned star already in its slot and another chaos aligned Titan in her slot. There is a bonus, or stacking, effect of having a bunch of &quot;like-minded&quot; cards, so this combination of three cards (each say producing one chaos token for this turn, 1+1+1=3) there would be a +2 chaos bonus. So if the player can navigate the correct stacking of &quot;like-minded&quot; or similarly aligned cards, there are bonus effects that can speed up your plan (OR slow down opponents).<br/><br/>"}, "121917": {"poll": [], "name": "RoleChess", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Role Playing"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Chess Games"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1257769_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1257769.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Dice"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "RoleChess <br/>is a combination of Chess and a role game that is played with pieces similar to those used in Chess.

It was developed by BAO Ltd., a company run by Flight Simulator developer Bruce Artwick. Charles Guy was lead developer on MSS.<br/><br/>MSS incorporated concepts from astrodynamics and celestial mechanics. It uses Newton laws of motion but takes account of relativistic effects by decreasing a spacecraft's acceleration as its speed approaches the speed of light. However, it does not take account of time dilation. In addition, atmospheric flight is not modeled.<br/><br/>MSS provided support for high-resolution graphics running in 256 color mode at up to 800x600. The graphics featured dithered gouraud shaded 3D vessels, with texture mapped planets, moons, and deepsky objects.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/><br/>     14 spacecraft models (real and fictional) ranging from a compact manned maneuvering unit (the Space Shuttle's MMU) to an interplanetary passenger transport (Galactic Explorer) and a giant interstellar freighter (Zander Freighter).<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Destinations including space stations (both almost-historical e.g. Space Station Freedom and futuristic e.g. Ring Station 1), bases (e.g. Kennedy Space Center or futuristic Marineris Base on Mars) and celestial bodies (including comets) in both the solar system and outside (e.g. in the Polaris or Vega star system).<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Spacecraft instrument panel providing altitude and velocity information.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Video recording and screenshots.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Predefined missions which task users with accomplishing certain objectives (like Apollo 17 moon landing or docking a Shuttle to Space Station Freedom).<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Autopilot and flight computer autopilot can be used to execute 15 maneuvers of different complexities (ranging from attitude/orientation control to automatic landing).

It has the quirky character that it is a game without a winner, just a loser. Basically it is a guessing game involving coins. Each player draws some number of coins between zero and three from their pocket and holds them concealed within a clenched hand. If more than three are held this is deemed to count as three. The denomination of the coin is irrelevant, its just the number that counts. The idea is then to take turns to guess the combined total number contained in all the players' hands. Its that easy ! One player starts by making a guess ('call' or 'shout') and then the guesses proceed clockwise until all have guessed a number that hasn't previously been taken. This is a single round of the game. All players then reveal their coins, a total is calculated (and checked!) and someone may be 'out' if they chose the exact number (there are no prizes for nearly). If this happens the not-loser will then sit out the remaining rounds of this particular game and the others will play more rounds in the same way until only two players are left. The player who loses this last round buys the drinks. If nobody guessed the correct number in any given round then the round is played again. Every time a round is played the first person to call rotates clockwise to the next available player.<br/><br/>"}, "121936": {"rpgdesigner": ["Patrick Bennat", "Frank Cibulski", "Thomas Finn", "Axel Hollmann", "Thore Husfeldt", "Michael Kilka", "Thomas M.

Evade the ruthless Wind Pirates as you collect influence with the powerful Sky Guild. Manipulate the commodity market using your powers of persuasion. Through clever trades and resourceful captaining, you can seize the title of Master of the Sky Guild!<br/><br/>Each round of Sky Traders takes place in two main phases. In the first phase, players sail their ships and perform actions. To start, each player draws an Ill Wind card, which has a variety of effects that can help or hinder players. The Sky Patrol could attack you for carrying contraband, or the Wind Pirates might try to board your vessel in hopes of plundering valuable goods. If you're lucky, you'll stumble upon a treasure map that leads to riches. It's all up to fate when you draw from the Ill Wind deck.<br/><br/>You'll add new members to your crew to gain various improvements. Skymen lend their blades to fight off Wind Pirate attacks. Other shipmates can help you earn more money when selling goods. Some crewmembers even make it possible to disregard the results of an Ill Wind card. You'll want to be judicious when hiring crew since they take up valuable space on the ship that could be used for trade goods.<br/><br/>If your skyship requires repairs or refueling, visit a city. While there, line the ship's cargo hold with valuable textiles, spices, or even jewels, then deliver the goods to another city where entrepreneurs will pay large sums of money for the items. Make sure to stock up on goods when the price is low and sell them off when their value increases.<br/><br/>In the second phase of each turn, the Guild Council takes place. During this round, players deliberate with each other in hopes of persuading their peers to help influence the price of goods. Strike a deal with your peers and you could force a surge in the value of the commodities you own, but if you've angered your rivals, they may choose to team up and devalue the wares you are selling.<br/><br/>At the end of the Guild Council phase, each captain also has the opportunity to purchase Influence, which increases his ability to control prices and moves him a step closer to victory. Influence is expensive, but you cannot become the Master of the Sky Guild without it.<br/><br/>As captain of your own skyship, you'll have to decide each turn how to best service your needs. Buying cargo at one port and delivering it to another city where the goods are highly desired is a great way to turn a profit. However, a captain also must consider hiring new crew, checking the ship&rsquo;s phlogiston (fuel for skyships) levels, repairing damage sustained in pirate attacks, and undertaking other important tasks to keep the ship running at peak performance. When money is tight, haul toxic sludge or collect minerals from the countryside to make some quick money.<br/><br/>FAQ &amp; ERRATA: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3532' rel='nofollow'>http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3532</a><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "French edition", "Spanish First Edition"], "average": "6.24066", "name": "Sky Traders", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Commodity Speculation", "Dice Rolling", "Modular Board", "Pick-up and Deliver"], "age": "14", "usersrated": "503", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Steampunk"]}, "121959": {"poll": [], "name": "Offroad Extreme!

However, some dastardly thief has stolen your ingredients! You need to replace them and come up with new dishes as soon as possible...<br/><br/>At the start of the game, players lay out 12-18 wok cards which show the dishes they can make or the special powers available to them in the kitchen. Lay out four lines of ingredient cards, with three cards each in the top two rows and two cards each in the bottom two rows; place six coin cards next to the top two rows, and four coins next to the bottom two rows. Each player starts with three coin cards in hand. On a turn, a player either:<br/><br/><br/>    Takes one coin card from one of the two rows of coin cards.<br/>    Buys all the ingredients in a row by paying however many coins lie next to that row.<br/>    Takes a wok card by playing ingredient cards with four matching symbols onto the table in front of you.<br/><br/><br/>When you take a coin, you reduce the cost to buy the ingredient cards in the two adjacent rows; when you buy ingredients, you place the coins used on the appropriate coin row next to the ingredients, raising the cost for future purchases. You also replace the ingredients with two or three cards from the deck as appropriate. When both ingredient rows next to a coin row are empty, each player takes one final turn, then the game ends.<br/><br/>Players then see which woks score for them: Some score the listed number of points; some require you to play a combination of ingredients onto them (whether from your ingredient cards on the table or those in your hand) in order to score anything; some score for each ingredient of a certain type or two placed onto them; and some score only for cards from your hand. The &quot;men at wok&quot; cards provide special abilities, boosting the points scored for certain types of woks, or allowing you to substitute one ingredient for another on one wok card, or transforming a wok into a fixed number of points with no ingredients required.

With 500 different hand-drawn images, you'll have hours of entertainment every time you play, and the game will never be played the same way twice.  Play with a friend while you're waiting for the bus or invite a group over for a game night.  It's small size and varying options for length of game play make it perfect for any occasion.<br/><br/>Object: <br/><br/>     To say an English word with the same first letter as the depicted image on the card before your opponent. The player with the most cards at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Playing the Game:<br/><br/>     Choose one player to start as the &lsquo;Blurbler&rsquo; (the person who starts the action by flipping a card onto the table). The Blurbler takes a small stack of cards, without looking at the images, and adds more to the stack as necessary.<br/>     Play starts between the Blurbler and the player to his or her left.<br/>     The Blurbler flips the first card from the stack face-up onto the table. The card should be placed at an equal distance between the two players. Each time a card is flipped, a &lsquo;face-off&rsquo; occurs between the Blurbler and the opponent.<br/>     The two players involved race to say any English word, that is not a proper noun or a number, that shares the same first letter as the object on the card. For instance, if the card shows a dog, words such as &ldquo;drain&rdquo; or &ldquo;dairy&rdquo; would be acceptable, whereas &ldquo;David&rdquo; or &ldquo;Denmark&rdquo; would not. Words used must be at least three letters long.<br/>     The first player to finish saying a correct word first is the winner.<br/>     The Blurbler continues to move clockwise around the circle until beat.<br/>     Once the Blurbler is beat, the deck is passed to the player who won that round, and a new Blurbler is born.<br/>     Play always resumes with the player to the left of the new Blurbler.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Scoring:<br/><br/>     The player who says a legal word first is the winner of that face-off.<br/>     After each face-off, the winning player takes the card and puts it in front of him or her.<br/>     If there is uncertainty about who said the word first, the other players not involved will vote on who won. If the round is deemed a tie, neither player is awarded the card, and the two players will face-off again with the next card.<br/>     A word may only be said once in a given sitting.  Let&rsquo;s say the octopus card is flipped.  One player yells &ldquo;orange&rdquo; and the other yells &ldquo;oblong&rdquo;.  If &ldquo;orange&rdquo; was said before &ldquo;oblong&rdquo;, then &ldquo;orange&rdquo; cannot be used for the duration of the game, but &ldquo;oblong&rdquo; is still allowed.  If there is uncertainty whether a word has already been said, consult the rest of the table for a group vote.  A redo card can be used to resolve any disputes.<br/>     If an incorrect word is used, for instance a proper noun, a number, a two-letter word, or a word that has already been used, players may continue to shout words until someone says a correct one. There is no penalty for incorrect words.<br/>     A word may not be used if its exact spelling is contained within the depicted image. For instance, &ldquo;rain&rdquo; could not be used for &ldquo;rainbow,&rdquo; or &ldquo;rob&rdquo; for &ldquo;robot.&rdquo; Similarly, if a word is pronounced the same, but has a different spelling, it cannot be used. In the example above, &ldquo;reign&rdquo; could not be used for &ldquo;rainbow.&rdquo; A word with a similar sound is acceptable, so long as it is not spelled out in the depicted image. For instance, &ldquo;row&rdquo; could be used for &ldquo;rope&rdquo; or &ldquo;camel&rdquo; for &ldquo;camera.&rdquo;<br/>     The player with the most cards at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Winning the Game:<br/>There are several different options of how to structure the game. In all options, the winning player of each face-off keeps that card. These options allow you to structure how long game play will last.<br/><br/>     Decide on how long to play and set a timer. When the timer sounds, players add up their cards to determine the winner.<br/>     Play to a predetermined number. Once someone has accumulated the predetermined number of cards, he or she is the winner.<br/>     Decide on how many cards will constitute a game.  This can be done by simply grabbing a smaller stack from the deck, or counting out an exact number.  Play until all the cards are gone.
