The deck is dealt out face down evenly among the players. Cards depict Power Rangers, bad guys, or puzzle pieces. Each player simultaneously turns over their top card and the player with the highest value card wins them all. If there's a tie, the tying players continue turning over cards one at a time until someone turns over a higher value card. The player that wins the trick takes all point cards and places them in a separate pile (to be counted up later). Then the winner collects all puzzle cards and puts them in the center of the table either starting or adding to a puzzle. There are 2 six-piece puzzles: one depicting a Megazord, and one depicting Rita Repulsa. The game ends when either puzzle is completed. If the Megazord puzzle is completed, the point values on Power Ranger cards are added up. If the Rita Repulsa puzzle is completed, the point values on bad guy cards are added up.

PLAYERS WATCH THEIR STOCKS FALL, RISE, CRASH and SKYROCKET . . . RIGHT BEFORE THEIR EYES! For added excitement, players also Mine for Gold and participate in a Gold Rush!  The &quot;Game Play&quot; in Stock Rush is so unique and diverse that it spans many game categories including: Strategy, Family, Party, Simulation, Educational, Action and Adventure!<br/>  <br/>For 2 to 10 Players, Ages 8 and up.<br/><br/>DETAILED SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Game play begins on The Opening Bell space and a peg is used to keep track of the trading day.  Players can play a regular game and spend a full business week on Wall Street [Mon-Fri] or they can play a shorter game by starting on Wednesday.  The game usually ends when the trading day peg reaches &ldquo;Game Over&rdquo; which is the slot after Friday.  Other ways the game can end are: &ldquo;Market Collapse&rdquo; in which all companies go bankrupt; One player left in the game after all the other players go bankrupt and All players are trapped in a Cave In.  At the end of the game, all players liquidate [sell] their holdings to the bank and the player with the most cash wins the game.<br/><br/>STOCKS . . .<br/><br/>Players buy and sell [Trade] stocks at the current market price shown by the &quot;Market Display&quot; [4 Stocks comprise the market in the game, A,B,C and D]. The stock prices are affected by news and rumors that randomly occur throughout the course of the game. There are two types of news and rumors that occur: Market News and Rumors affect the entire market; and Company News and Rumors which only affect a given individual company. Although rumors occur at random; how long they remain alive can be strategically predicted. The longer a rumor remains alive the higher the chance it will be confirmed or dispelled on the next turn. Consequently, players must trade accordingly; they must decide on 4 Criteria: [1] Buy or Sell?; [2]Which Stock to Trade?; [3] How many Shares to Trade?; and most importantly [4] When to Trade?.<br/><br/>COMMODITIES [MAINLY GOLD] . . .<br/><br/>The Stock Rush name was inspired by the California Gold Rush of 1849. As a result, a significant portion of the game is dedicated to that historical event. Players randomly mine for Gold and participate in many Gold Rushes throughout the game. During a &ldquo;Gold Rush&rdquo; players may become trapped in a &ldquo;Cave In&rdquo;.  Trapped players may escape on their own or be rescued by other players.  <br/>Once players accumulate Gold they may strategically sell any amount they wish on the &quot;Gold Exchange Market&quot;. They must sell according to 3 Criteria:<br/>[1] How much Gold to Sell? [2] At What Price to Sell? [3] When to Sell?  The other commodities in the game are Groceries, Toys, Clothes and Gear&hellip;the STUFF we use in our everyday life.<br/><br/>"}, "16397": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Casdon Football", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2020": "Simultaneous Action Selection"}, "yearpublished": "1966", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": {"5551": "Sports: Football / Soccer"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1180317_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3655": {"name": "Casdon"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1180317.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"141943": "Casdon English First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Hands on soccer much like the &quot;bubble&quot; hockey games of today where two players face off in a match of dexterity and control while moving the soccer ball down the field.<br/><br/>"}, "16398": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic104062.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"174338": "Division War"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamecompilation": {"147066": "Kidz Cardz 4 Favorite Card Games"}, "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"39055": "Jim Davis"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"171": {"name": "(Public Domain)"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic104062_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "War can be played with a standard 52 card deck as well as special themed decks of different sizes.<br/><br/>The deck is dealt out evenly to the players into face down piles.

In that campaign the Japanese overran Malaya, captured the strategic British base of Singapore and conquered Burma. Later campaigns saw the Japanese-Allied struggle for the Indian Frontier, the deployment of the Chindits, and the final Japanese grasp during the Imphal campaign, followed by the Allied counter-attack that won victory in the theater.<br/><br/>CBI is intended to be a simple game: it allows for the completion of the entire four year campaign within 16 turns.  It includes all critical operations, however: land and air warfare, special operations and logistical considerations. The game has two players: the Allied and the Japanese.  Players conduct operations with their units in their own turns. The objective of the game is to capture strategic locales and destroy enemy units.<br/><br/>Game scale: Each map hex equals 60 kilometers. Each turn represents three months of operations. Each airstrike represents one or two British wings, US groups or Japanese air regiments.<br/><br/>The game includes three scenarios. Scenario 1, &quot;Singapore to Calcutta&quot; is the campaign game, 1941 - 1945 (16 turns). Scenario 2 covers the last Japanese offensive in Southeast Asia: &quot;Imphal&quot;. Scenario 3 is a short scenario entitled &quot;Fall of an Empire&quot; and covers only the first few turns of the war, through the 1942-III turn.

If their destination is not a terminal, then they first must deadhead to the nearest terminal before drawing a card. There are 11 dispatch cards for each of the terminal cities.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, players can buy more trucks, up to four of them, at $60,000 each. They can borrow up to $50,000 but must make minimum payments on every die roll until it is paid back with interest. The winner is the player to that makes the most money (including truck values) by the end of 3 hours or whatever other time limit may be agreed at the outset.<br/><br/>The roads contain a variety of hazards, from minor annoyances like D.o.T. inspections and flat tires ($100) to a blown engine ($6,500) or a wreck and hospital stay ($8,000). Dispatch cards may be for regular loads (which use a 1 ,2 ,4, 8, 9, 10 green die), or wide loads that move on a slower 1, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7 red die. Players may buy insurance against cargo damage (or not) and occasionally get asked to take an illegal Hot Load, which pays well if delivered on time but nothing if late or stopped at a scale or inspection point.<br/><br/>Players passing through Atlantic City, Reno or Las Vegas have the option of gambling, drawing from a deck of Chance cards.<br/><br/>"}, "16454": {"boardgamedesigner": {"41804": {"name": "Akira Shimazu"}}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Battle of Santa Cruz", "playingtime": "360", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "yearpublished": "1985", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": {"13255": "Country: Solomon Islands"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic69244_t.jpg", "average": "5.66667", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1034": {"name": "Tsukuda Hobby / Original"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic69244.jpg", "maxplaytime": "360", "boardgamecategory": {"1008": {"name": "Nautical"}}, "age": "14", "minplaytime": "360", "description": "This is a Japanese naval wargame on the Battle of Santa Cruz during World War 2.

The two dealers want to store spices so that they know where everything is, but they also have to keep the rats at bay.  Stack your crates, keep your spices together, and cover up the rats.<br/><br/><br/>Rat Hot is a two-player game developed from Michael Schacht's Dschunke: Das Legespiel on his own label Spiel aus Timbuktu, which in turn was developed from his game Dschunke, also published by Queen. The Rat Hot tile distribution differs slightly from Dschunke: das Legespiel but you can very nearly use the Dschunke: das Legespiel rules with a Rat Hot set.<br/><br/>All the games use the clever mechanism of stacking long 3x1 tiles so that the upper tiles obscure some parts of the tiles underneath. In Rat Hot, the two players simply take turns to draw 2 tiles from a face down pile, and add them to the existing layout.<br/><br/>The tiles are all 1x3 and show a combination of rats, spices or empty crates. Each player has four different types of spice in their player colour which they are trying to form into large groups. Many of the tiles have spices of both colours.<br/><br/>The game is scored with grey and yellow chips which represent 1 and 2 points. Each time you place a tile, you and your opponent can score points from groups created or changed by that tile. Whenever a group of two of the same spice is formed, the owning player receives one point, or two points for groups of three or more. Beware! If there are three rats of your own colour visible at the end of your turn, you instantly lose.<br/><br/>When the draw pile is exhausted and the tiles all placed, the board is scored once more for all players, so trying to preserve existing groups also counts.<br/><br/>The real trick in the game comes in the tile placement. Tiles must be adjacent by at least one square. Tiles can placed on top of other tiles, so that stacks build up. But a tile can not sit exactly on top of another, so there must always be some offset, and all three squares of a tile must be supported by other tiles, or the table.<br/><br/>Rat Hot can be very tricky. You want to keep your opponent's rats exposed in awkward places, so they have to spend both their moves trying to keep the rats covered. But you also want to set up scoring positions, and cover your own rats, and avoid giving your opponent points as well. There's a good mental challenge here, as you puzzle over the best use and arrangement of your tiles. Do you dare leave two of your rats open, because your opponent may draw more of your rats and make it impossible for you to finish your next turn with less than three showing. Can you get a good group of spices going and also break up your opponent's groups? Tricky problems for tricky minds.<br/><br/>Rat Hot is a quick, fun game and is a good addition to Queen's line of small 2-player games. The wood chips make it easy to see who is leading, the tiles are nicely made, the graphics are fun, and the game plays quickly and fairly. You can be stuffed by unlucky tile draws, but perhaps your low score is more to do with your choices, or maybe the other player is just smarter than you. Fast play, easy rules, and the risk of sudden death give Rat Hot a high replay value.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"21795": "EN/FR/ES/DE edition"}, "average": "6.32639", "name": "Rat Hot", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2048": "Pattern Building"}, "age": "8", "usersrated": "945", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"7520": "Animals: Rats"}}, "16498": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic90090.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"4959": {"name": "Harald Lieske"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2005", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"4959": "Harald Lieske"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"47": {"name": "Queen Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic90090_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1020": {"name": "Exploration"}}, "description": "A Queen game by Harald Lieske.

In each round, a player first builds up his clan and landholdings, and then optionally conducts a raid on an opponent.<br/><br/>You start by pulling six cubes from a bag. With green cubes you increase your ministers and potential to gain VPs at the end of a round. Yellow cubes attract warriors and permit you to hold more battle cards. The blue cubes are &quot;pipers&quot; used for combat support or possible VP generation. A blue cube can also be played as a &quot;bard&quot; to lure away opponents' followers. Finally, there are the red cubes, which represent cattle and generate VPs. You also use cubes to create new estates, where you can deposit cattle and groups of cubes (which are safer than those not on an estate).<br/><br/>Raids are resolved simply. In three battle-rounds a card of value one to four is played by the two opponents; this value can be increased by a single blue cube. The one who wins the most battle-rounds wins the fight. The loser will then lose cubes while the victor gains a VP or two.<br/><br/>After each round there is a valuation, in which the VPs are determined based on number of cubes. For example, the player with the most green cubes gets 3 VPs, while second most gets 2 VPs; if two players are tied for most, each gets only 1 VP. Another example: each red cattle tile is worth a VP, but if one player has the most he gets a 2 VP bonus.<br/><br/>The estate tiles contain a number on the back. After each round a panel is turned.

Be careful - Max can also bluff by calling one player's word and lighting another player's light. Any player that reacts would then lose a point.

It was invented by Indie designer Mike Church whose stated goal was to create a trick game where the role of chance (&quot;hand-luck&quot;) was as small as possible.<br/><br/>The usual object is to avoid taking the most points in a round and, secondarily, to score as many as possible up to that. (That is, if the 120 points split 42-34-25-19, it's best to be the '34' and worst to be the '42'.) Bonuses, known as Nil and Slam, are given respectively for taking no points or for taking 75+. Thus, almost any hand dealt has some strategy: few terrible hands exist.<br/><br/>Ambition is as much a game of players, and the interactions of their varying strategic objectives, as of cards.<br/><br/>For improvement's sake, the inventor has updated the game several times since its first publication in November 2003.

Will humanity set aside their differences and stand as one against the darkness? Or will this be humanity's Final Twilight?<br/><br/>Final Twilight is a modern fantasy themed card game for two players.<br/>Players each select a Major Character featured in the game's storyline and build a deck around that character; supporting characters, special action and spells, weapons and items, all ripped from the pages of the story come to life on the game board. <br/>Using Location cards to build a small portion of the great city of New Metropolis, players move between sites and backdrops of the story, dueling other characters including fantastic creatures, horrors of the shadows, and helpful, though innocent, bystanders. <br/>Magic is scarce and unusual in the world of Final Twilight. While hiring goons and allies from our normal world can be easy, summoning the vast forces of nature takes its toll; fantastic characters, spells, and magical abilities all require a small piece of the mage.

Players play the part of sheriffs in the Old West, each trying to capture the highest value collection of outlaws in their jails.<br/><br/>Your jail (aka Calaboose) is a collection of cards kept face up on the table in front of you.  Jails can only hold 5 outlaws at any one time, and each outlaw has a &quot;strength&quot; rating.<br/><br/>On your turn, you can either place an outlaw from your hand into an empty slot in your jail or into someone else's jail.  The outlaws each have &quot;power&quot; ratings.  An outlaw can be sent to replace a weaker outlaw in someone else's jail.<br/><br/>You can defend your jail.  If someone sends an outlaw to your jail, you can eliminate him with one of your outlaws - but you have to send your defender to someone else's jail.  That person can defend against you, of course, so each turn has the possibility of generating a chain reaction that involves multiple players around the table.<br/><br/>It's a lighthearted social game with a solid core of strategy. Higher value cards tend to be weaker, and sets (or &quot;gangs&quot;) are worth much more than singletons.  Everyone at the table can see what's in your jail, so as you gain the advantage you also acquire a bullseye. Attacking another player's jail may backfire on you, so you have to be careful and constantly adjust your strategy to the cards on the table.<br/><br/>"}, "16089": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic158248.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3990": {"name": "Wolfgang Dirscherl"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2002", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"11797": "Christof Tisch"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3001": {"name": "W.

The movie (with the title character Bibi, who is a young witch) is based on a decades-old, long-running radio play and animated series but was also inspired by the success of the Harry Potter movies.<br/><br/>It's a roll and move game for juniors with four quests to complete. Roll and move effect is mitigated in a number of ways - players can re-roll once in each turn and they can collect helping cards when arriving on specific spaces or rolling a pentagram. The four quests are as follows:<br/>- Library: find the book that opens a secret door to the secret passage. For this, find the same-colored book as the spaces you arrive on.<br/>- Maze: to find your way through the maze, move the 5 moving pentagon tiles showing parts of the maze. These can be moved (turned or moved to different spaces) when rolling a pentagram or when arriving on a pentagon space. Cards might also help.<br/>- Suspended bridge: each step (space) has some hidden traps that are revealed when stepping on them, easily causing players fall into the abyss. Some of them can be avoided with knowledge (knowing which blue owl has which number on its bottom), others with planning and luck (e.g. tiles where you fall into the abyss if you arrived there with specified die rolls), others with discarding a card. If a player falls into the abyss they have to climb back to the bridge and try again. The task gets easier once tiles are revealed and players know what to expect.<br/>- The Five Owls: owls have to be placed on the five numbered spaces in order (the owl with number 1 to space 1 and so on). If a player fails they go back to the entrance of the owls hall. The numbers on the bottom of the owls can be looked at during game (with cards or when rolling a pentagram) but whenever they are checked (secretly, by the active player) they are placed back to another space so their location keeps changing and players must watch their movement closely during the course of the game.<br/>The first player to correctly place the fifth owl to its corresponding place on the last space of the path wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"247545": "'Das Spiel zum Kinofilm' Edition"}, "age": "7", "name": "Bibi Blocksberg und das Geheimnis der blauen Eulen!", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2047": "Memory"}, "average": "4.75", "usersrated": "8", "boardgamefamily": {"10575": "Characters: Bibi Blocksberg"}}, "16129": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Trivial Pursuit: Pocket Player Set \u2013 TP's People", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1987", "usersrated": "15", "boardgamefamily": {"101": "Trivial Pursuit"}, "maxplayers": "12", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic104874_t.jpg", "average": "4.66667", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"328": {"name": "Horn Abbot Ltd."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic104874.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"240627": "French edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1064": {"name": "Movies / TV / Radio theme"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "(From the box:) Trivial Pursuit Pocket Player Sets let you play a great new way - anywhere, without a board!

Your tabloid is seeking to have the best stories in the business. Deal the cards and write some headlines!&quot;<br/><br/>Self-published game consisting of 96 word cards, a few blank cards and a couple of quick-reference cards. Each word card has 4 different words on it along with either a positive sign ( + ) or a negative sign ( - ). Words are articles, nouns, verbs, adjectives or adverbs. Different symbols correspond to the different parts of speech.<br/><br/>Everyone is dealt 10 cards face down (your personal pile) and players then draw 3 of those cards to form a hand. Remaining cards form a draw pile. On your turn, you may start a headline with a noun or article card, add a card to your headline (following normal sentence structure), add a card to someone else's headline (if you have a headline of your own started) or pass (and draw a card from the draw pile). If you use a card from your hand, you draw a card from your personal pile. Headlines must start with a noun or article and must contain at least 2 nouns and 1 verb. The headline is completed and set aside when the second noun is placed.<br/><br/>The round continues until a player runs out of cards from both their personal pile and their hand. Each player then scores their completed headlines. Incomplete headlines do not score any points. Subtract the number of negative cards from the number of positive cards in the headline. If the result is positive, this is your score. If the result is negative, take the absolute value as your score (e.g. you get 4 points for a score of -4).<br/><br/>The first player to reach a score of 10 wins the game. However, &quot;The primary purpose of RAG is to be entertaining. Many of the headlines will be funny. Some of them will be VERY funny! Enjoy the game and laugh a lot.

The game ends when one of the figures reaches its starting farmhouse or when all players have played all of their cards.<br/><br/>Fruit tokens are then awarded in order of the players' total strength on each farmhouse: the strongest player takes the fruit token with the highest Yum-yum value, the second-strongest player takes the next highest-valued token, and so on.

According to what the avatar at the oracle had said, Urrick would be here, and he would be unbeatable without the aid of a spell caster.  That is why, as a sinister form began to take shape within the eldritch mists of the portal, Twoelk&rsquo;s trepidation grew.  He slowly drew the magic arrow from his quiver, and glanced sideways at the amazon.  Alyta&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on the portal and the terror within.  They could now discern the immense stature of the Rakshasa as it stepped through the vapors.  It was Urrick.<br/><br/>As the tiger-man&rsquo;s pale eyes narrowed on the two adventurers, he sneered.  He would enjoy eviscerating these foolish humans, and dining upon their entrails.  But before he could pounce upon his victims, an unseen force left him suspended in mid-leap.  It seemed the Twoelk and Alyta were equally stunned.  &ldquo;Now, my friends!  Strike now!&rdquo;  It was the voice of Brannig, whom they believed had been killed in the ruins south of the oracle.

The Standard Rules are identical to those used in the first Modern Battles (Quad).  In this new series the same scale is used (one mile per hex and 12 hours a turn). Units range in size from companies to brigades.  Artillery units have the ability to add to the defensive strength of friendly units being attacked. Artillery has various ranges, some in excess of ten hexes.<br/><br/>Also included (in various games) are rules for Untried units, special river conditions, other special terrain, airpower, ammuniton depletion, B-52 and B-1 bomber attacks, commandos, paratroopers, stacking, garrison units, bridge destruction, militia, artillery suppression, command control, helicopters, replacements and international cooperation.<br/><br/>Movement is sequential and single-phased. Zones of Control are rigid, and combat is mandatory between adjacent units. The Combat Results Tables (there are two, representing different doctrines) use a differential system.

The followers, of which each player only has four (with a fifth for the scoring track) get placed as robbers (in the mountains), seafarers (on the seas) or explorers (on the meadows). On a player's turn, they must place a tile and may then place a follower on it.<br/><br/>As in the original game, tiles may only be placed so that identical landscape types match up. A follower may only be placed when no other follower has been placed there yet. When the follower is removed, however, then the size of the region in which the follower is located brings points - regardless of whether the region has been closed off or not, although closed off regions score considerably more points. There's also an additional rule that lets mountainous regions increase in value, even if they've already been completed.<br/><br/>This is a distinctly simpler version of Carcassonne than the original. This was the goal during the development of the game. It should have simpler rules, but offer greater strategic depth. What is interesting about the game is that regions aren't scored automatically any more (when they are closed off), this is a decision left to the player (the removing of the follower).

It was designed as a celebration of golf, the 'Royal and Ancient' game that was hugely popular with affluent 'bright young things' whose world is reflected in novels by Evelyn Waugh, Nancy Mitford and P.G. Wodehouse<br/><br/>Play begins once each player has selected a colour counter and the order of play has been decided. Each player takes it in turn to place his counter on the starting point and flip it once towards Flag 1. When it is his turn again, the player flips his counter towards the first 'hole' from wherever it is on the board after his previous attempt. To complete the 'hole', a player's countermust come to rest on the white circle of a flag, but is not necessary for it to cover the whole of the space. When a player's counter touches the white circle and completes a 'hole' it can be flipped agian towards the next flag. The winner is the first player to reach Flag 16, the final 'hole' of the Golf Tiddlywinks course.<br/><br/>A counter that comes to rest on an opponent's counter must go back three 'holes'. Counters that land in a bunker or lake are returned to the start, from where the player must try to reach the Flag that was his goal before he encountered the hazard.

The Bastiano army counterattacked driving the Guerrillas back into the mountains beginning in June 1958. When the Bastiano army attempted to destroy the guerrillas, the Bastiano army was all but destroyed itself. With all the newly acquired weapons, the guerrillas launched a final offensive that ended in the only major battle of the war at the town of Santa Clara. The defeat of the Bastiano western forces caused the rest of the army to begin deserting. When Batista fled in January 1959, the guerrillas triumphantly declared the island was finally free.

This results in real chaos and soon the first parts will be falling to the ground. Try to keep your eye on your strategy to get the highest score. Limited edition of 150 pieces, numbered and signed by the author.<br/><br/>Each player gets four little plots on the back of the game-box. Depending on the number of empty plots, a player gets material at the beginning of his turn. Now he can use this material to build connections between his plots. There are different building-styles which are more or less difficult and therefore result in more or less points. A player can also use the already built parts of the other player, which is easier and therefore results in less points. If you manage to build very complicated connections, you'll get more points. After a while, the board will be full of chaotically arranged bridges. If something falls, you'll get penalty, so be careful! Once all plots are connected, the game is over and if you didn't plan carefully you again get a penalty.<br/><br/>"}}
