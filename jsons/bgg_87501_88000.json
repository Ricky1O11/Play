The gameplay is essentially similar to the original, but a number of new features boost gameplay to new levels.<br/>There are devices that can be picked up and used only one at a time, the devices being: snare traps, incapacitating sprays, jackhammers, two types of bomb, pickaxes which make a pile of rock from the ceiling blocking your enemies, and buckets filled with goo that is used to cover surfaces and slow characters down.<br/>The game also resurrects the original Lode Runner's several varieties of &quot;turf&quot; as well as introducing one more. In addition to the standard turf, which is susceptible to being dug through with the player's blaster, there are also the nostalgic bedrock (which can only be penetrated with a jackhammer or a larger bomb that, unlike small bombs, permanently destroyed turf or any other item in the level except the exit) and trapdoor turf, which resembles regular turf but which actually is empty space.

The graphics feature 2-D sprites in a three dimensional world. Although each battle begins on the ground, the majority of the action is featured skyward. The characters fly around each and utilize rapid punches and kicks, and ki blasts, either singularly or rapidly by holding the assigned button for a short period. The characters have a limited amount of ki that can be charged over time. If the player uses all of their available ki their character will stop fighting out of exhaustion, leaving them wide open for an attack. The life meter is a scale made up of energy from both sides that shifts depending on damage taken, and after one side is depleted, the character performs a special &quot;Meteo Attack&quot;, which takes place in a cut scene and finishes of the opponent. Each match is made up of two teams that can include one fighter or multiple fighters that can be switched out at various times.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;List of Dragon Ball video games&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "87521": {"rpg": {"424": "Mage: The Ascension"}, "poll": {}, "name": "World of Darkness: Mafia", "rpgproducer": {"13959": "Ed Hall"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic895633.jpg", "usersrated": "4", "rpgitemversion": {"74480": "Softcover Version"}, "rpgsetting": {"2591": "World of Darkness (cWoD Modern)"}, "average": "6.75", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"945": "Crime"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"10104": "World of Darkness"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic895633_t.jpg", "description": "From the Back Cover:<br/><br/>This Thing of Ours<br/><br/>Like the supernatural denizens of the World of Darkness, the men of respect are damned in their own unique way.

Europe lay at Hitler&rsquo;s feet and a British Expeditionary Force had fled the Nazi war machine at Dunkirk, leaving Hitler in control of Western Europe. Only one power remained defiant against him: Britain and their &ldquo;war monger&rdquo; leader (as Hitler would often describe him), Prime Minister Winston Churchill.<br/><br/>The Nazi plan for the invasion of Britain, Operation Sealion, required air supremacy to work, in order to counter British control of the seas. The resulting air battle, known to history as the Battle of Britain, has become one of the legendary air battles in the history of the world. It not only prevented Operation Sealion from being attempted, it was the first crack in the fa&ccedil;ade of Nazi invulnerability. This work provides statistics for the major British planes that fought for the British in WWII, allowing the game master to bring the Battle of Britain and many other famous air encounters into his Modern WWII games.<br/><br/>Includes the following aircraft: Albemarle (1940), Blackburn Roc (1939), Blackburn Skua (1938), Boulton Paul Defiant (1939), Bristol Beaufighter (1940), De Havilland Mosquito (1941), Fairey Albacore (1941), Fairey Barracuda (1943), Fairey Firefly (1943), Fairey Fulmar (1940), Fairey Swordfish (1939), Gloster Meteor (1944), Hawker Hurricane (1937), Hawker Typhoon (1941), Lancaster (1942), Supermarine Spitfire (1938), Westland Whirlwind (1940).<br/><br/>"}, "87541": {"rpgitemversion": {"74519": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Blood & Guts 2.0: German Aircraft of World War II", "rpgproducer": {"4016": "Chris Davis"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic853574.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"184": "History"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"305": "d20 Modern"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"5796": "Blood & Guts"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic853574_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The story of German aircraft during WWII is something of a schizophrenic tale. Early in the war they devastated opponents through radical new strategies of combined arms, with Stuka dive-bombers and Messerschmitt fighters flying in close air support over the German Blitzkrieg.<br/><br/>These victories, culminating in the stunning and unexpected quick victory over France, then saw the dreaded Luftwaffe lose more and more ground. Once it had to face sophisticated enemy aircraft, the Luftwaffe proved unable to cope with British, Soviet or American aircraft. Their victories early in the war had blinded them to the weaknesses of their aircraft and prototypes of faster, more heavily armed aircraft spent years on drawing boards or moving through Byzantine bureaucracies, only making their way into production once the skies over Germany were filled with more British and American bombers than could ever be shot down.<br/><br/>So the tale of the German Luftwaffe is really two tales: one of stunning victories and novel strategies and the other of &ldquo;victory sickness&rdquo; in which tried and true designs were sent into battle against Allied craft that became more sophisticated by the day.<br/><br/>Included Aircraft: Focke-Wulf Fw 190 (1941), Focke-Wulf Ta 152H (1944), Heinkel He 111 (1936), Heinkel He 177 (1942), Junkers Ju 52 (1931), Junker Ju 87 &ldquo;Stuka&rdquo; (1936), Messerschmitt Bf 109 (1937), Messerschmitt Bf 110 (1936), Messerschmitt Me 163 (1944), Messerschmitt Me 410 (1943).<br/><br/>"}, "87542": {"rpgitemversion": {"74520": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Blood & Guts 2.0: In Her Majesty's Service", "rpgproducer": {"24623": "Charles Baize"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic921122.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"184": "History"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"305": "d20 Modern"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"5796": "Blood & Guts"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic921122_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Parachute into hostile territory with an SAS troop.

The sleigh has flown off on it's own and now it is a race: Krampus is out to ruin everyone's night by stealing gifts and Santa is trying to retreive the sleigh and deliver the presents.<br/>The board consists of eighteen areas, the north and south poles which are the base points for the Santa and Krumpus players.  The sleigh is placed in the center of the board.  The game includes three dice, hand painted with both numbers and the following symbols:<br/>1,2 :footprints<br/>3,4  :sleigh<br/>5    :a spring<br/>6    :a hand<br/>and on one die, a three is an asterisk, representing a wild face.  The game may be played with normal dice, but one 3 face must be marked to represent the wild symbol.<br/>Setup continues by rolling the dice six times (3d6) and laying cubes that represent the gift targets on the resulting spaces, which are numbered from 3-18 (1 and 2 are the poles, and will never have gift targets placed on them.)<br/>The dice and the player's tokens are manipulated using the dice.  Each turn the player may roll 3 times, keeping a die or two each time.  If a die is kept, it must be used at the end of rolling, there is no deciding to reroll later.  Whatever is rolled on the third roll is kept and used.  <br/>Keep on footprint to move one space, two to move three spaces, and keep three footprints to move four spaces.  Movement is orthogonal only, never diagonal.<br/>Keep one sleigh to move the sleign one space orthogonally, two to move three, three to move hour.  In addition, if the player's token is in the same space as the sleigh, you must roll two sleighs to board the sleigh.  Once on the sleigh, the sleigh is moved with either footprints or sleighs (not a combination of both, though you may wait until the end of the third roll to decide which you will use to move the sleigh.)  Move the sleigh to bring it closer to you, or to keep the other player from intercepting it.  The sleigh may not be moved remotely if the other player is riding it.<br/>Roll and keep three springs to eject a player riding the sleigh back to his or her base.  (In variant play, any gifts on the sleigh at this point remain aboard)  While unlikely, it is possible to eject yourself from the sleigh if you roll all three dice three times and it pops up.  If so, too bad, back to base with yourself!<br/>If on the sleigh and in the same space as a package, roll and keep two hands to deliver the package as Santa or steal the package as the Krampus. In either case, place the package in your base as a point.  <br/>The wild symbol may substitute for any other in the above combinations.<br/><br/>Winner is player to pick up the most gift tokens when the last one is picked up, ties going to Santa, because it's Christmas, after all.<br/><br/>Variant Challenge 1: To 'win' a gift and get the point, you must return to your base with it (no roll required to drop it)<br/><br/>Variant Challenge 2: Use Variant Challenge 1, but the other player may also steal gifts from your base, and the winner is the first to get ALL the gifts.<br/><br/>"}, "87546": {"rpgitemversion": {"74525": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Blood and Space", "rpgproducer": {"4016": "Chris Davis"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic853575.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "average": "6", "rpggenre": {"183": "Science Fiction"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"305": "d20 Modern"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"8370": "Blood and Space"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic853575_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>A comprehensive starship adventure sourcebook designed to supplement or extend any of the popular d20 space based role-playing games.

The city is, until recently, was one of many provincial estates, the situation changed, however, several years ago, shortly after the Civil War, which was consuming Zhongguo. There came the most famous masters of martial arts styles and built their own schools here. Since then Tsiengtao is called the City of a Thousand Warriors.<br/><br/>It is in Tsiengtao where action takes place. This is an extremely powerful urban center, filled with magnificent buildings, such as Tsiengtao Brewery, the first in the whole empire, Eglantine Gardens or Dragon's Cavern.

Past products in the Legends line have walked a fine line with magic, either incorporating a limited magical presence into the rules themselves (as was done in Legends of Excalibur: Arthurian Adventures) or publishing magic rules for each setting in a separate book for the Gamemaster to use or exclude as appropriate for his particular campaign (as was done in Legends of the Samurai). Legends of Sorcery takes the latter approach one step further, serving as the magic supplement for all future books in the Legends line. From this point forward, Legends books will be written as magic-free historical sourcebooks, providing historical information and combat classes. They will include guidelines for using Legends of Sorcery to add magic to the setting or time period (if desired).<br/><br/>What's different about Legends of Sorcery? <br/>Legends of Sorcery is a skill-based magic system that abandons the spell slot system found in traditional fantasy d20 games derived from the SRD. It also abandons the spell point alternative used in past Legends books. Spells are cast with a skill check; the result of failing this check depends on the margin by which the skill check failed. Characters learn spells the same way that they cast them, except that learning a spell (adding it to the list of spells a character can use) is somewhat easier than casting that spell in the heat of battle. In addition to using a skill to represent spell casting, Legends of Sorcery also introduces the concept of the Base Magic Bonus. This represents the magical power inherent in the character's class, and serves as a modifier to any skill check the character makes to cast or learn a spell.<br/><br/>What's the same about Legends of Sorcery?<br/>More than you might think. In this system, a character's spellcasting ability is limited by his skill and magical power, not by the number of times each day he can cast a given spell. However, Legends of Sorcery still uses spell levels, and all the spells in the PHB and other 3rd-party supplements will work under the rules presented here, should you wish to use them. This product changes the way spells are learned and cast, but does not alter the spells themselves.<br/><br/>Legends of Sorcery Includes:<br/><br/>     A new skill based casting system.<br/>     11 spell casting core classes: Alchemist, Artificer, Elementalist, Hermit, Holy Man, Monk, Naturalist, Pagan Priest, Priest, Sage, Seer, Trickster.<br/>     New and modified metamagic feats.<br/>     New Spells.<br/>     New magic options.<br/>     Fate and Destiny system.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "87605": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Clockwork Man 2", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"74632": "Downloadable Edition"}, "average": "6.5", "videogameseries": {"8382": "The Clockwork Man"}, "videogametheme": {"2266": "Steampunk"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4729": "Macintosh"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Embark on a steam-powered, rollercoaster journey through land, air, and water in this unique Hidden Object Adventure!<br/><br/>Miranda and Sprocket are back!

Player participation is again compiled to complet wars and other important events. The game retains the odd humor and parodies, though usually less off the wall than in its predecessor.

For example, Roman legionaries would have a high UCV due to their better equipment, good leadership, and regular training while barbarian tribesmen would have a lower UCV.<br/><br/>Combat is divided into shooting, impact, and melee. Unit's abilities are divided into strengths and weaknesses in these areas. For example, a barbarian unit may have a high impact value, meaning that they have a formidable first charge, but their value in an ensuing melee is less imposing.<br/><br/>The figure scales used for the game is 1:50 (one model figure representing 50 actual men) and the time scale is one turn equals approximately 60 minutes.

Each character has different objectives, abilities and weapons at their disposal. The single-player campaigns present the player with conventional series of levels that are designed around the abilities of each character.<br/>As the Colonial Marine, the player uses a number of weapons to combat Aliens and Predators. The Marine wears armor for protection, and uses an image intensifier, flashlight and flares to improve visibility in dark areas.<br/>When playing as the Predator, the player uses a variety of weapons from the Predator films such as wrist blades, a throwing disc, and shoulder-mounted energy weapons. The Predator is more durable than the human or the Alien and can survive falls from greater heights than the human. It can use a cloaking device to become invisible and several different modes of vision to help in the detection of enemies, including infrared vision and a mode sensitive to electrical systems. Unlike in the previous game, the Predator in Aliens versus Predator 2 recharges its energy supply using a personal item.<br/>As an Alien the player can explore most of the game's environments freely, even climbing across walls and ceilings. However, the Alien has no weapons and must use its claws, tail, and jaws to attack enemies. The player can also use a form of echolocation in dark areas and can detect pheromones to discern human or Predator enemies. The Alien can drop from any height without injury and is the fastest of the three player characters.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Aliens versus Predator 2&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "87657": {"rpgitemversion": {"74748": "First Printing"}, "poll": {}, "name": "W\u0142adcy losu", "rpgproducer": {"5143": "Micha\u0142 Oracz"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1042159.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpg": {"8402": "W\u0142adcy Losu"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpgseries": {"8378": "Nowa Fala"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1042159_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the cover:<br/><br/>&quot;W\u0142adcy losu&quot; to hybryda gry RPG i gry strategicznej.

Each has been contrived to show a historic resolution, fun for the English player, depressing for the French. Azincourt (French spelling) is a unique approach. The French might have had more coordinated leadership. They might not have been so intent on an easy victory, and as a result been so careless. They might have taken advantage of the vulnerable English advance. They might have waited for the English to wear themselves out crossing the muddy field and allowed Henry to make the first attack. They might have employed their crossbows to better effect. Had they better control of their troops, crowded conditions would not have reduced combat effectiveness. Finally, had they considered avenues for retreating units, disruption of fresh units would not been such a problem.<br/><br/>In Azincourt I address a number of these what-ifs but, moreover, I offer players the unique mechanic of commanding one flank of each opposing army. In effect players play BOTH the French AND the British. It works out much better than you would expect. Since the English line is necessarily pretty static, there is little problem in coordinating an English defense while splitting command of the French in the face of the enemy mirrors the historically poor French command.<br/><br/>Azincourt is a card assisted, counter and hex game utilizing large colorful counters and a variety of aids that allows for a key battle component which other versions neglect to emphasize - the capture of nobles for ransom. Integral to Azincourt play is the capture of these nobles, English and French (including King Henry), of varying value. Ah and then there are the complications that such nobles bring.

These are common across all the races in all the lands. Heroes and villains alike feel exactly the same emotions as a simple innkeeper and his family. What differentiates the heroes and villains from the innkeeper is in how they harness their emotions.<br/><br/>Think for a moment about the various types of adventurers you see, and reflect on how emotions are employed in their lives. Barbarians, with their raging strength are obvious users of anger, but so is the ranger who dedicates her life to eradicating goblinoids. Bards make their living playing upon the joy and sadness of their audiences, and any rogue worth his salt is a master of surprise. Necromancers and other like-minded wizards rely on disgust and fear for their powers, while paladins stand at the opposite end of the spectrum to oppose them. Clerics, druids and monks use a combination of these emotions in their daily lives, be it through communing with a deity, with nature, or while immersed in self-reflection. These people are not ruled by emotion, rather they harness it, turning it into a powerful tool which grants them nigh-unlimited potential and power.<br/><br/>The pages that follow detail emotion-based feats, prestige classes, magical items and spells that I have seen or discovered in my travels. It is my hope that you, dear reader, will learn to harness the power of raw emotion and use it to better the world.<br/><br/>"}, "87689": {"rpgitemversion": {"74802": "Swamp Things"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Swamp Things!", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic877702.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"240": "Greyhawk"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"221": "Dungeons & Dragons (3rd Edition)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"1981": "COR - Living Greyhawk Core Adventures"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic877702_t.jpg", "description": "From the front of the adventure:<br/><br/>Dark slithering denizens of muck and despair threaten a once peaceful druid's domain, now in the midst of its own political upheaval.

A curse is retributive evil or misfortune: bad things happening to those who commit some grave sin or crime. Some would call it bad karma, while others attribute it to the prayers or invoked curses of those seeking to harm transgressors. It is this sense of &ldquo;just desserts&rdquo; that keeps people believing in them. People want to believe that the bad guy always gets what is coming to him. Anyone who suffers a disproportionate amount of bad luck when compared to the rest of the populace is commonly believed to be cursed.<br/><br/>Odysseus was cursed in Odyssey by Poseidon for tormenting Poseidon&rsquo;s son, the Cyclops Polyphemus, and did not make it home for ten years. Many myths and ancient stories revolved around curses, blaming any and all misfortune on the gods.

The gracious people of Elysburg greet the party with respect and admiration and see to their every need. The PCs are lavished with grooming, baths, clothing, and entertainment&mdash; everything they could possibly need or want&mdash;for a price.<br/><br/>The fair town of Elysburg has learned that agricultural income is far inferior to the influx of money adventurers can bring in. So the town has devised a method of sapping every hard earned coin from their adventuring guests. The town, lead by the beautiful half-elf Cleric of Trickery, Ariadne Moonsleight, traps incoming adventurers in a tale of horrific plights and terrible monsters. No good adventurer can stand idly by and watch the poor defenseless town be ravaged by such foulness. But, unbeknownst to the townsfolk and our fair adventurers, the town&rsquo;s invocations of a false god have the attention of the demigod Mardax, and his scorn could tear the town asunder.<br/><br/>"}, "87697": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Cosmic Osmo and the Worlds Beyond the Mackerel", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"74815": "Macintosh edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1100485.jpg", "videogameseries": {"8429": "Cosmic Osmo"}, "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4729": "Macintosh"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1100485_t.jpg", "description": "Cosmic Osmo and the Worlds Beyond the Mackerel is a graphic adventure computer game for the Macintosh computer line (Plus, SE, SE/30, II Series, Classic, LC) created by Cyan, Inc..

This often overlooked obstacle (no pun intended) is a staple of standard dungeon design in fantasy worlds. Many weaker monsters, such as goblins and kobolds, rely on the pit trap for its effectiveness in beefing up the defenses of their lair &ndash; slowing the progress of (and hopefully debilitating) any would-be intruders. More powerful creatures use pit traps to capture prey, keep their prisoners contained, or in conjunction with other, more sinister traps.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this classic trap has become increasingly dismissed as clich&eacute; &ndash; a bit of old hat that can be easily avoided, disarmed, or survived. This supplement intends to challenge those presuppositions by presenting a wide range of options and enhancements for the common pit trap. To be sure, the old favorites of fantasy gaming are here, but the numerous options, as well as some new and unexpected twists on the pit trap concept itself, will add a fresh new dimension to using them. DMs should find inspiration here to include a wider variety of deadfalls and other perambulatory hazards to his or her game.<br/><br/>"}, "87711": {"rpg": {"1788": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Races of Evernor Part I", "rpgproducer": {"30599": "Risa Johnston"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic855266.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"74846": "PDF version"}, "rpgsetting": {"3973": "Realms of Evernor"}, "average": "0", "rpgissuearticle": {"69789": "Legions Realm Reviews"}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"8434": "Races of Evernor"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic855266_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Been yearning to play something a little different?

It is similar to &quot;Fight the Landlord&quot; (Dou Di Zhu) but with some noticeable differences - the biggest being that the 3 (not the 2) is the high card, but also in the number of cards in the pot and allowable plays.  Because the runs are relatively limited (4 through K only) and because there are no &quot;bombs&quot; it is a bit more predictable in its gameplay than Dou Di Zhu.<br/><br/>Each round starts with dealing the cards (except for four of them) and an auction for the remaining cards.  The winner of the auction then picks up the cards and plays against the other two opponents who are now in a temporary partnership.<br/><br/>The goal for each round is to shed your cards.  The winning bidder needs to shed all his cards first before one of the opposing players sheds all of their cards.  Allowable plays are singles, pairs, triplets, quads and runs of three+ cards and staircases of three+ sets (note that runs/staircases may only involve 4's through K's).  There are no &quot;bombs&quot;.<br/><br/>If the high bidder wins, then the other players pay him the amount of points bid, and if the high bidder loses, then the each of the other players are paid the amount of points bid.  Online implementations of the game generally play for a predetermined number of rounds and the individual player with the most points at the end of the last round is considered the winner.<br/><br/>"}, "87733": {"boardgamedesigner": {"63568": {"name": "Elke Kahlert"}}, "average": "4", "poll": {}, "name": "Wer's wei\u00df gewinnt!", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "3", "yearpublished": "1999", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic873815_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"11901": "Oliver Freudenreich"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"11": {"name": "F.X.

Play and become a true Lord of Tierra Mesa by beating your rivals.<br/><br/>AIM OF THE GAME:<br/>The aim of the game is to achieve, before the other players, a combination of 5 cards with the same value, or to form an army with 5 consecutive cards of the same race or where each value accords a different race (Unbeatable Run).<br/><br/>You will become Lord of Table Land in several ways:<br/>1.    Gathering together an army of 5 consecutive cards (run) of the same race.<br/>2.    Gathering together 5 cards of the same value (archers, princesses, catapults&hellip;)<br/>3.    And finally, the Unbeatable Run; you can get an army alliance gathering 5 consecutive cards of a different race each.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who gathers one of these combinations.<br/><br/>BEFORE THE GAME:<br/>-    Shuffle the cards.<br/>-    Hand out 5 cards to each player.<br/>-    Allocate the deck of cards facing down, in the middle of Table Land.<br/>-    The first game starts with the player who owns most hairs in his ears, continuing then, in a clockwise direction. The following games are started by the winner of the previous game.<br/><br/>Once all the cards have been distributed to the players the game stars. The player that starts the game draws one card from the central deck, looks at it, and gets rid of the card which is not convenient for him. Each player should always have 5 cards.<br/><br/>Each player discards should be placed on Table Land, ALWAYS in front of the player, creating a deck where the last discarded card is shown. This way there should be as many discarded decks as players.<br/><br/>When a player gets rid of a card and puts it on its deck facing up, any interested player can take it. How? The interested player should cover it with its hand. The fastest player covering the deck is the one that gets the card. This player should then discard one of his cards. Then, the game continues in a clockwise direction starting from him.<br/><br/>This way the game continues until one of the players gathers 5 cards with the same value or 5 consecutive cards of the same race or the Unbeatable Run. The player should let the other players know during his turn by placing the discard card facing down and by showing his 5 wining cards, he gains the victory by beating his rivals.<br/><br/>WINING COMBINATIONS:<br/><br/>Option 1 &ndash; Whoever wins 5 games is the winner of the whole game.<br/><br/>Option 2 &ndash; After each game all card points must be counted, except those from the winner, being 100 points those from the action cards. The player with fewer points after 5 games is the winner.<br/><br/>Option 3 &ndash; After each game only the winner&rsquo;s points must be counted, in this situation the value (each value corresponds to a different race) of the Unbeatable Run is three times the addition of the values. The game finishes when one of the players reaches 1000 points or a previously agreed quantity.<br/><br/>These are not the only possibilities, players can agree on other options for victory.<br/><br/>ACTION CARDS:<br/><br/>This game has a series of action cards which are used for the interaction between players to threaten their rivals:<br/><br/>Skull (2 cards): If a player places this card on the other player&rsquo;s deck it means that all his troops have been killed. He must place all his cards, facing down, beneath the central deck and draw 5 new cards.<br/><br/>card swap (1 card): If a player places this card in another player&rsquo;s deck, both players must swap one card.<br/><br/>hand swap (1 card): Placing this card in another player&rsquo;s discard deck means that you swap your hand of cards with that player.<br/><br/>steal 2 cards for the deck (2 cards): Placing this card on to other player&rsquo;s discard deck means that the player who has placed the card (the attacking card) randomly takes 2 cards from the other player&rsquo;s hand, and then this player must immediately pick up two new cards from the central deck. The 2 cards that have been taken from the player&rsquo;s hand must be placed beneath the central deck without looking at them.<br/><br/>steal 3 cards for the deck (1 card): Placing this card in another player&rsquo;s discard deck means that the player who has placed the card (the assailant) randomly takes 3 cards from his rival&rsquo;s hand. Then, the rival should draw 3 new cards from the central deck. The cards taken from his hand must be placed beneath the central deck without looking at them.<br/><br/>steal a card (3 cards): Placing this card in another player&rsquo;s discard deck means that the player who has placed the card (the assailant) randomly takes 1 card from his rival&rsquo;s hand, and keeps it. Now the victim has 4 cards, therefore he must pick up a new card to have 5. The assailant has now 6 cards therefore he must discard one of them to have 5 again to continue the battle.<br/><br/>Potion (2 cards): the joker substitutes any other card concerning value and race. It can NOT be used as action card. One player can have on its hand up to two jokers.<br/><br/>FAQs:<br/><br/>- Which discard cards can I pick up? You can only pick up the last card that has been placed at the top of the discard deck from the player that&rsquo;s on its turn.<br/><br/>- After an action card who continues? The player next to the player who has discarded the Action Card, always clockwise.<br/><br/>- Do runs or the Unbeatable Run have to start from number 5? Runs do not have to start from 5, as long as they are always consecutive numbers.<br/><br/>- What should it be done if the extension of Tierra Mesa cannot be cover and a player does not reach their rivals discard decks? Instead of hunting the card with the hand you should scream Guar!!! The one that screams it first takes the card.<br/><br/>- Can I draw one card from any discard deck while other player is drawing a card from the central deck? When a player picks up a card from the central deck the possibility of taking a card from a discard deck is blocked.<br/><br/>- If I take a card from a discard deck, can the card that appears underneath be taken later on? NO. Those cards were previously played, therefore, you should pay attention!!<br/><br/>- What should it be done when the central deck finishes? All discard decks from all the players must be gathered together to form a new central deck. The cards must be shuffle before placing them on the middle of Tierra Mesa.<br/><br/>- If two players place their hands on a discard deck, who takes the card? Either the one that has more fingers placed on it, or the most aggressive one.<br/><br/>"}, "87749": {"poll": {}, "name": "\u0427\u0451\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0437\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043e", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic858260_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3481": {"name": "\u041e\u041e\u041e \"\u0422\u0435\u0445\u043d\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\""}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic858260.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"74902": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1069": {"name": "Modern Warfare"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Black Gold is a modern warfare wargame with strategic elements.<br/>Players seek to control the oil fields, and destroy opposing enemy units.

In this way, you can create a unique fantasy universe of your own, molded to fit<br/>the needs of your campaign. Your universe need not be the same as another DM&rsquo;s, any more than two dungeons in your campaign world need to be the same, though they may use the same components.<br/><br/>The various planes are categorized into five general groups. The Material Planes are the various campaign worlds in which characters may adventure. The Outer Planes are the homes of gods and other great powers, as well as the &quot;final resting places&quot; for spirits of the dead. The Inner Planes are wellsprings of elemental forces and pure energy-the building blocks of the cosmology. Demiplanes are finite planes with limited access, often created by magical force and mortal endeavors. Stitching all these together are the Transitive Planes, which allow movement along and often between other planes. In the core cosmology, the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, and the Plane of Shadow are all Transitive Planes. The World Serpent Inn (described in detail below) is also a Transitive Plane. You can use it in addition to the core Transitive Planes, or as a replacement for one of them.<br/><br/>"}, "87753": {"rpgitemversion": {"74907": "PDF Version"}, "rpgseries": {"8338": "Wizards of the Coast Web Enhancement"}, "name": "A Druid's Grove", "rpgproducer": {"16364": "Sue Weinlein Cook"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic855226.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "average": "6.16667", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"221": "Dungeons & Dragons (3rd Edition)"}, "poll": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic855226_t.jpg", "description": "From the PDF Introduction<br/><br/>A Web Enhancement for Masters of the Wild: A Guidebook to Barbarians, Druids, and Rangers<br/><br/>No self-respecting druid would ever live in a city.

It first appeared in 1982, and employed an 8086 CPU. It ran at a clock speed of 5 MHz, with two &micro;PD7220 display controllers (one for text, the other for video graphics), and shipped with 128 KB of RAM, expandable to 640 KB. Its 8-color display had a maximum resolution of 640&times;400 pixels. Its successor, the PC-9801E, which appeared in 1983, employed an 8086-2 CPU, which could selectively run at a speed of either 5 or 8 MHz. The NEC PC-9801VM used NEC V30 CPU.<br/><br/>In the 1980s and early 1990s, NEC dominated the Japan domestic PC market with more than 60% of the PCs sold as PC9801 or PC8801. In 1990, IBM Japan introduced the DOS/V operating system which enabled displaying Japanese text on standard IBM PC/AT VGA adapters. After that, the decline of the PC98 began. The PC-9801's last successor was the Celeron-based PC-9821Ra43 (with a clockspeed of 433MHz), which appeared in 2000.<br/><br/>FreeBSD/pc98 runs on PC-9801s equipped with an Intel 80386 or compatible.<br/><br/>Software for the PC98 generally ran from program and data disks (Disk 0 &amp; 1) or (A &amp; B), and NEC did not have a strong GUI to go up against Microsoft's Windows 95 when it took Japan's PC market by storm. NEC's decision to work with Microsoft to offer a PC98 compatible version of Windows 95 could be seen as the first step towards the 9800 series computer's downfall, as consumers were no longer required to have an NEC-built system to run software designed for Windows.<br/><br/>The PC98 is different from the IBM PC in many ways; for instance, it uses its own 16 bit C-Bus instead of the ISA bus; BIOS, I/O port addressing, memory management, and graphics output are also different.

You can only hope to make it big enough (generally about $40,000 worth of treasure) to get to the next phase--where you hired a historian and a diver rig for a few weeks.  Then you thoroughly explore your island's coastal waters in the hopes that you can accumulate a few hundred thousand dollars.

During this time Solomon instituted an unprecedented building program. As one of Solomon's chief governors, you must procure materials and oversee construction of buildings and roads across the land for the glory of Solomon. You will also help to construct the Temple, one of the wonders of the ancient world.<br/><br/>Kingdom of Solomon is a worker-placement game with a few new twists and turns. Do you claim a resource space, an action space or throw in all your remaining pawns to grab a powerful Bonus Space? Will you spend your resources to extend Solomon's kingdom, take some points in the Market or add to the Temple? These and many other choices await you in this highly interactive game.<br/><br/>You play Kingdom of Solomon in rounds of four phases.  You start the round placing your pawns to get resources, take actions or get a bonus.  In this placement phase players take turns, each placing one pawn at a time.  After all pawns have been placed, players resolve what they get from placing their pawns.  This is called the resolution phase, and each player, in turn, resolves the placement of all their pawns before the next player.  Next the players can go to the Market to sell or buy resources.  In this market phase, like the placement phase, players alternate taking turns, except that players take turns in reverse order.  The last shall be first, and the first shall be last.  Finally, you build in the building phase.  Players, one at a time, can build a building, roads and add blocks to the Temple.<br/>  <br/>When you place pawns to take actions, you can get an additional resource for a resource space, trade one resource for another, steal a resource from an opponent, get victory points or draw Fortune cards.  You can play Fortune cards at any time.  Fortune cards provide resources, victory points or special actions.  Bonuses your pawns can gain for you include one of every resource, three Fortune cards or victory points with a rearrangement of turn order so you become the new first player.<br/><br/>You use resources to build things.  Each thing costs a specific set of resources.  The buildings you build give you victory points and additional spots to place pawns for resources or actions.  Roads link resource spaces into resource regions so you can get more resources per pawn placed in the resource region.  Building Temple blocks give you either victory points or temple tokens that help you gain or keep the High Priest.  The High Priest lets you take advantage of another player&rsquo;s resource region and gives you victory points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game ends at the end the round when a player places all his building tokens on building sites, there is a building token on each of the building sites, or the Temple is complete.

The game controller resembles that of the Sega Genesis in shape, only with more buttons and it is virtually identical to a DUO-RX controller except for the fact that the rapid fire switches have been changed into mode A/B switches.<br/><br/>The PC-FX's computer-like design was unusual for consoles at the time. It stands upright like a tower computer while other contemporary consoles lay flat. Another interesting feature is its three expansion ports, as expansion ports are relatively underused in consoles and therefore their inclusion increased the price without offering a great deal to the end user. However it was one of the first consoles to feature an optional mouse which made strategy games like Farland Story FX and Power Dolls FX more accessible to play on TV.<br/><br/>Unlike nearly any other console (except for the 3DO), the PC-FX was also available as an internal PC card in NEC PC-98 and AT/IBM PC compatible flavors. This PC card came with two CDs of software to help the user program games for the PC-FX.

Portal publishing house decided to release it in an enlarged version, along with a number of additions, handouts and additional materials - in experimental, limited edition boxed.<br/><br/>The adventure takes place entirely in Seattle, deep in the territory of Moloch, where machines rule for years, and the remnants of humanity struggle to survive in the underground parts of the city, making up the shrinking every day no man's land. People - few, outnumbered, hit by diseases and mutations, sometimes savage, but knowing much about the world of machines, as opponents they have not only ruthless robots, but other &quot;parasites&quot; - mutated animals, monsters, mutant tribes, etc. Players' characters are - except for one - the inhabitants of one of the settlements: scouts, pipe fitters, guards, or specs, who must face the threat of annihilation facing them and their friends. It soon becomes clear that the only way to avoid extinction is to escape. Heroes therefore move in search of the legendary city of the resistance, at first taking care about the safety of their people. It's finding, however, is no end but rather the beginning of many adventures. Special role has the character who is from the south, living proof that not all the world is dominated by Moloch.<br/><br/>&quot;Moloch: ucieczka z miasta maszyn&quot; is a glimpse into the world of Neuroshima like no other before. Heroes wander through the land of machines, discovering its secrets and overcoming many dangers, learning as much about the environment as about themselves. Players who always ask themselves the question - &quot;How is behind enemy lines&quot; - finally get an answer, and it is in the form of an extensive campaign.<br/><br/>In the box is the text of the adventure - and thus material for game master - and a manual for players, including both the introduction to the world on the other side, as well as rules to create characters who live in it. The intention of the authors was to give not only expansion useful while playing the campaign, but also when playing any adventure set in the territory of Moloch in general.<br/><br/>The adventure is divided into two main parts (wandering and events in the resistance movement), and each of them into several stages. Game masters receive the tools on which they can built multi-session campaign - long or short, but enough to play no less than six (up to even a dozen!) sessions. Sessions tend to be different - from action-paced and clashes, by requiring players to think to complex spy games and battles for power. The amount of material and its modular design provides a lot of scenes, which - if not used during the main campaign - can be developed into separate adventures. &quot;Moloch: ucieczka z miasta maszyn&quot; is the material for months of playing.<br/><br/>The box with the campaign includes:<br/><br/>- An epic campaign for more than a dozen gaming sessions<br/><br/>- A manual for a player playing on the territory of Moloch<br/><br/>- Logical board game - a tool for the GM and players to break the security codes and<br/><br/>- Tactical map<br/><br/>- A postcard from the City Engineering<br/><br/>- A newspaper from the world Neuroshima<br/><br/>- Lots of handouts<br/><br/>- Surprise<br/><br/>"}, "87852": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Gridiron!", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"75102": "Amiga edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2365": "Sports - American Football"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4415": "Amiga"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>Gridiron is an American Football sports action game for one or two players.<br/>Graphics are minimal, but functional, with the point-of-view being top-down, two-dimensional.<br/>Opposing teams are represented by circular spots, black and orange respectively.<br/><br/>Playbooks for offensive, defensive and special plays are provided, with players choosing which ones to use at a given time.<br/><br/>Player control is via mouse in the usual manner.<br/>On the offensive, users will start with control of the quarterback, until the ball is passed via handoff or throw, at which point control reverts to the receiving player.<br/>On the defensive, users can choose which player to control, switching if necessary.<br/><br/>"}, "87853": {"rpgitemversion": {"75104": "The Plague of the Third Season"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Plague of the Third Season", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic878746.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"240": "Greyhawk"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"221": "Dungeons & Dragons (3rd Edition)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"1981": "COR - Living Greyhawk Core Adventures"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic878746_t.jpg", "description": "From the front page of the adventure:<br/><br/>A friend has been captured.

George is held at New York, Lizzie is imprisoned in Tokyo, and Ralph is stored in London (references to King Kong, Godzilla, and The Werewolf of London, respectively). Scumlabs, who has just rebuilt their facilities in Salt Lake City, causes another accident that results in three new monsters: Curtis, a mouse, Boris, a rhinoceros, and Ruby, a lobster. Players choose one of the three original monsters to rescue. The player then uses the characters in the part of the world where the rescue is held. They work as a collective to break buildings, eat people, and destroy cars and this creates competition among players.

Each mission has the same general goal &ndash; fight through the masses to complete the set task. The tasks vary from defeating particular enemies to saving allies to destroying enemy structures.<br/><br/>The player can choose any of the five heroes as their character in each level, and the different characters provide a range of unique abilities. In addition, the different heroes each have a personalized story that provides a particular view on the war against the Lord of Night.

As the group plays together more, they become more familiar with each other's ideas of the game, and are able to bring each others' Visions into play more easily.<br/><br/>"}, "87907": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic871740.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"42982": {"name": "Alessandro Lala"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"28906": "Cory Williamson"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"17441": {"name": "Gotha Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "240", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic871740_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "description": "1865 Sardinia is a board game belonging to the 18xx series for 2-4 players and set on the Sardinia island (and Corsica).<br/><br/>Players play the role of 19th century entrepreneurs investing in the construction as well as the financial and operational management of railways.

The world's oceans our are largest single resource.  If they are abused, mis-managed or ignored; we on land will be worse off for our neglect of this wonderful planet.<br/><br/>Sea Ranger can teach or remind us all of our place in this world; how we use the oceans and waterways; the balance of life and our needs; raise our awareness of how mankind neglects or abuses these incredible places.<br/><br/>Within, on and around our oceans and rivers, hide a multitude of life, living in a state of balance, growing and evolving.  Mankind is upsetting this balance to dangerous levels.<br/><br/>Learn, have fun with friends and family, share this knowledge and make a difference in this world.<br/><br/>What is Sea Ranger?<br/><br/>Sea Ranger is a board game designed to educate and entertain 2-6 players about the amazing and diverse wildlife that inhabits the oceans and waterways creating a giant circle of life.  We can also learn how mankind uses and abuses this incredible resource we all share.<br/><br/>Sea Ranger is a multi-facetted game.  Not only are the players learning about the aquatic environment, they are also learning about themselves.  Players learn many qualities of character that are required to either win or prevent collective loss among the players.  They share the responsibilities, successes and benefits.<br/><br/>Players learn:;<br/><br/>To share and care for resources.<br/><br/>Collective and individual responsibility.<br/><br/>Manage resources.<br/><br/>To maintain a balance of life and needs.<br/><br/>Value life in all forms as part of the wealth of this world.<br/><br/>Respect each players participation and support.<br/><br/>The best part is that it is fun doing this.<br/><br/>Who Can Play?<br/><br/>The game is aimed at children from 8 years and over and adults.  Children will require guidance to assemble.<br/><br/>Children quickly master the rules.<br/><br/>So how does it all work?<br/><br/>The game gives players knowledge and choices.  Players can easily discern what feels right or is the right thing to do.  We all know within our hearts what is right and good, even if we don't know the answer.<br/><br/>The game uses a special board and tokens.  You print out the board and pieces on your colour printer, then cut and assemble the components.  To make them last longer or be more durable you may mount them on card or laminate the pieces.  Teach the children skills as they read instructions and learn to cut out the pieces.<br/><br/>The game is directed by a special card deck which will present players with a series of events and choices.  The players must decide how they will resolve these, sometimes this may require teamwork and sharing.  There are many different strategies you can use to win, some can be very quick, others slower.<br/><br/>Part of the game revolves around maintaining the circle of life, ensuring a balance of species to enable life to continue.  Each creature is part of that circle and has a unique role to play.<br/><br/>Players must then try and balance mankind's intervention and damage to the seas and waterways.  It is a careful juggling act; players individually cannot hope to keep the balance so you need to play cooperatively.<br/><br/>What Do I Get?<br/><br/>Sea Ranger is 26-page colour PDF plus a small rules booklet.   The game requires you to print 16-pages to create the board, cards &amp; tokens.  Included is the deluxe card set giving you the choice of finish.  Where possible we have tried to minimise the graphical content to save ink.  Ideally the major components are printed on card.

For the past nine years, they have been host to over six hundred orcs, which is certainly an anomaly in the average Faer&ucirc;nian community. In 1360 DR, Zhentil Keep sent one thousand orcs to aid in the fight against the westward-sweeping Tuigan hordes.<br/><br/>The orcs fought well-well enough that the citizens of Thesk welcomed them as citizens when Zhentil Keep abandoned them in this land in 1363 DR. Still, a current of unsettling concern lingers. Some believe that the orcs are still part of Zhentil Keep&rsquo;s strike force, but that they went on standby to wait for the moment when their masters give the signal. Once allowed, these orcs may launch a crippling attack from within.<br/><br/>However, in nine years, no signal has been given-at least none that any of the paranoid folk have noticed. The orcs are enthusiastic citizens and, apart from some rowdiness during breaks from the mines or fields, they have hurt no one.<br/><br/>And then, a prophet comes, with a message of war . . .<br/><br/>In A Call to Arms, the player characters (PCs) have a chance to prevent orcs from rising up against some humans. This adventure is designed for four 9th-level D&amp;D characters.
