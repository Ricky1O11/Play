The Shaman's assistant does not drink; he stands calmly beside her. The assistant is invisible. Adorned in animal skins and strange ornaments, the Shaman begins to guide the ritual. A drum is tapped with elderly fingers, creating a primitive disjointed rhythm. The weathered drum is played for some time, then stops abruptly. The Shaman looks about the room.

In the west Grant was moving on Vicksburg. In the east, the Army of Northern Virginia was holding off the Army of the Potomac, but Lee realized that this could not last forever. Something had to change, he would strike north and take the war to the enemy. After weeks of maneuver, a chance collision between the two armies would seal the fate of the Confederacy. Now is your chance to change history. Can you do better than Lee and crush the Union army as it arrives piecemeal? Or as Meade will you hold the heights and dash the last great hope of Confederate victory? The decisions are yours&hellip; in Gettysburg 150!<br/><br/>Gettysburg 150 is an expansion of the ideas contained in Hold the Line. Like Hold the Line, it uses command action points for units to move and attack. The CRT is simliar, although artillery is weaker at longer ranges due to the greater scale of the battle. However, the board is not modular and infantry units are stronger. Units are division level, with brigade level cavalry. Advanced features like column movement is covered simply with movement bonuses for not moving adjacent to enemy units. More importantly, the game has optional rules to increase realism, including early reinforcements, army demoralization due to heavy losses, and rules to encourage corps organization. The game has 4 scenarios covering days 1, 2, and 3, as well as the Confederate attack on Little Round Top on July 2. Scenarios are playable in 1 hour for the day battles, 20 to 30 minutes for the Little Round Top scenario. The complete 3 day battle is playable in 2.5 to 3 hours.<br/><br/>A division level Gettysburg game in honor of the 150th anniversary of the battle.  This simple fast playing game comes with a mounted 25 x 22 map, two counter sheets, rules, and dice.  You can play the entire battle in 2 to 3 hours, with 4 shorter scenarios.<br/><br/>Players will maneuver the counters representing the Union and Confederate armies across a hex cover representation of the battlefield at Gettysburg.  Each turn players get a number of action points that will allow them to maneuver, fire combat, and close combat enemy forces.  You will always receive some action points, but will never be sure exactly how many recreating the uncertainty of command and control. Victory is obtained by driving the enemy from the field by capturing terrain objectives or eliminating enemy units.<br/><br/>The game uses the popular Hold the Line game system as its base.  Optional rules include a Chaos of War table, force march, and more.<br/><br/>Includes a mounted game board, 2 counter sheets with large 7/8&quot; counter sheets, dice, and rules.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"193578": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.33086", "name": "Gettysburg 150", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "age": "10", "usersrated": "70", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"17619": "Hold the Line"}}, "135531": {"rpgitemversion": {"193037": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "The Old Absinthe House Blues", "rpgproducer": {"30817": "Jodi Black"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1518100.png", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": {"23111": "Deadlands Noir"}, "average": "7", "rpggenre": {"169": "Action / Adventure (Pulp)"}, "rpg": {"286": "Savage Worlds"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1518100_t.png", "description": "From Introduction and site details.<br/><br/>She was an ebon goddess on a dirty stage, belting out tunes to the locals every Friday and Saturday night at the Old Absinthe House.

To do so, however, you need to collect the ingredients for your three spell cards, and to do that you need to search the forest while Baba Yaga searches for you.<br/><br/>To set up the game, place nine Baba Yaga tiles in a cross to form a flight path, then place the 16 ingredient tokens face down, with four tokens in each section of the cross. Each player starts the game with three spell cards, which must remain hidden. On a turn, the active player reveals her top spell card, which shows four ingredients, then starts searching for these ingredients in the forest, turning over tiles one by one with a single hand and hiding those she doesn't need. While she does this, the other players take turns moving the Baba Yaga figurine one step at a time along one branch of the flight path, then back. If Baba Yaga completes a circuit before the player finds the ingredients, she must place her spell card on the bottom of her stack; if she finds the ingredients, however, she gets to cast the spell on the card, lengthening or shortening the flight path, swapping the location of ingredients, requiring fewer ingredients next time, forcing an opponent to play in a distorted position, and so on.

Scientists have discovered that Earth has only 6 years left before it becomes uninhabitable, and there is nothing that can be done to save our planet. You are a captain of a space ship that has been summoned to Earth to help start with the evacuation of the planet. You are not the only captain on the horizon looking to make some quick fame escorting earthlings to the other planets. You will have to trade with the planets in order to upgrade your ship so you can fight off each other as well as the Plutonian Space Pirate threat.<br/><br/>&bull; The object of &quot;8 Planets: Captains of the Solar System&quot; is to earn victory points by rescuing the people of Earth and delivering them to the other planets in our solar system. Each player has their own spaceship on which he may carry both Earthlings and cargo. Cargo is moved from one planet to another and the further the cargo travels, the more credits will be earned for delivering the cargo to the other planets. Players have the ability to upgrade their engines, expand their cargo space, and obtain more powerful weapons by using credits earned. Powerful engines allow players to travel a greater distance between planets, and they also affect turn order. Your cargo hold is small at first, but when you upgrade, you can hold greater amounts of cargo and refugees. Weapon strength helps you to defeat the Plutonian Space Pirates, who hide in the Main Asteroid Belt and Kuiper Belt. Strong weapons also help players defeat each other when they are engaged in player versus player combat.<br/><br/>&bull; Players earn victory points both by delivering people to other planets and by defeating other players in player versus player combat.

There are four rounds (seasons) of play in each year, preceded by the action of revealing one event card. Event cards affect each year of play by changing certain elements of the game.

The description is given by an assignment card combined with a spinner. The first player to shout a matching word wins the mini-game.<br/>    Math class: The player picks one opponent. He takes a regular die and a special die (which only rolls sixes). His opponents get two regular dice. Both players start rolling their dice. The first player to roll 7 wins the mini-game.<br/>    Geography class: The player is assigned a country that he has to depict. The other players have to guess the country. If someone guess correctly, both the guesser and the player score points, otherwise only the player scores.<br/>    Gym class: Each player receives a number of cards with the values 1 to 5. Then, the first player has to play one or two cards with the value '1' (facedown), the second player has to play one or two games with the value '2', etc. After the '5' has been played, the game continues again with the '1'. The first player to get rid of all his cards wins the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>You are allowed to play non-matching cards, but other players may accuse you of bluffing. If you are accused and were bluffing, the accuser wins the game. If you are accused and were not bluffing, you win the game.<br/><br/>    Schoolyard (playing hide-and-seek): The player picks an opponent. Both players receive a set of schoolyard cards. Each card has an picture of a schoolyard scene. Then, a random item is determined. The first player to find that item in the pictures wins the mini-game.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The game is over when each mini-game has been played four times. Now, the scores for each player are added up. The player with the highest score wins the game.<br/><br/>"}, "135686": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "average": "3.325", "poll": {}, "name": "Weetjes Kwartet", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1887881_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1613": {"name": "Identity Games International B.V."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1887881.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"229455": "Auto edition 2011"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Weetjes Kwartet (Trivia Quartett) is a Quartett game with a minor twist: In addition to seven regular sets of four cards, the game contains two sets of five cards.

Gameplay is the same as Hold&rsquo;em except the criteria for determining and ranking winning hands has been changed due to the style of cards used in this version of the game.<br/>   To better understand these rankings, it is necessary to explain the makeup of cards in Dead Man&rsquo;s Hand. In stead of the regular playing card deck used for Texas Hold'em, this deck is first made up of four types of zombies: Walkers, Shamblers, Runners, and Infected. There are twelve cards for each type of zombie. These twelve cards for each type are further divided into Red and Green colored text, with six of each zombie type. Each zombie card also has two numbers, a Decomposition number and a Hunger number ranging from one to six. These numbers and colors are arranged in such a way that each zombie has three other zombies (one of each type) that match it in both color and numbers. Thus, with these card differences, the criteria used for hand rankings is changed while keeping the dealing/betting/bluffing aspects of regular Hold'em.<br/>   Dead Man&rsquo;s Hand is played on a single table with 2 to 10 players. The game is also played with an assortment of chips for the betting rounds. Traditional poker chips can be used or you can try our &quot;Dead Man&rsquo;s Hand: Poker Chips of the Living Dead&quot; (available separately) for a set of zombie themed chips.  <br/>   The goal is simple: win as many chips as you can, one pot at a time. You win a pot by having the best hand, or by having all other players fold before the showdown.<br/>   As in Texas Hold'em, a hand of Dead Man&rsquo;s Hand consists of one to four betting rounds. A hand ends when all players but one have folded, or the fourth and final betting round completes with multiple players still in the hand - whichever comes first. At that point, players enter into the showdown, where remaining players discover who has the best hand.<br/><br/>"}, "135732": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2801846.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"127493": "Bolt Action"}, "is_expanded_by": {"204136": {"name": "Beyond the Gates of Antares: The Battle for Xilos"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"39": {"name": "Rick Priestley"}}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamecompilation": {"183968": "Beyond the Gates of Antares: Strike Vector One \u2013 The Xilos Horizon"}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamepublisher": {"24232": {"name": "Dark Space Corp"}}, "maxplaytime": "180", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2801846_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1117": {"name": "Book"}}, "description": "Beyond the Gates of Antares invites us to a time when mankind has evolved into new and diverse species: the strangely powerful NuHumans, masters of the Panhuman Concord; the ape-like Pansimians, the greatest warriors in the whole Galactic Spill; and feral Revers primitive Humans driven by a irrepressible lust for adventure and danger.

The player takes on the role of one of the stranded characters and must survive from day to day by foraging for food and supplies, forging equipment and dealing with the various perils of the Don't Starve world which include changing weather and seasons, environmental hazards, and physical and supernatural monsters, all whilst trying to keep healthy, well fed and mentally stable.<br/><br/>Don't Starve features a strong rogue-like element, with perma-death and little in game help or instruction making surviving the game's randomly generated wilderness both tough and unforgiving.

Once again, a historically, ethnically, and culturally homogeneous people separated by politics and economics hurl men, weapons, and material into the maelstrom of modern combat in an attempt to settle their bitter division once and for all.<br/><br/>Next War: Taiwan, the next volume in GMT's series of Next War games and the follow-on to Next War: Korea, allows players to fight a near future war in and around the island of Taiwan. In this sequel, the communist state of China, the PRC, has decided that its time to end the rhetoric and posturing and bring the breakaway republic back into the Socialist Harmonious Society.<br/><br/>Due to the nature of the &quot;terrain&quot; surrounding Taiwan, the game features an expanded, yet still abstracted and playable, naval system including submarine threats, ASW, mine warfare, and anti-naval strikes. In addition, rules exist for combining Next War: Taiwan with Next War: Korea to simulate an expanded conflict.<br/><br/>Note: the Next War series is not an Introductory wargame. Rather, we have intended herein to create a system (and a series) that will allow detailed study of modern warfare in various venues as well as engaging gameplay. That said, the Standard Game rules encompass a fairly straightforward ruleset that will, we think, be considered pretty &quot;easy to learn&quot; by experienced wargamers. So players who choose to play Standard Game scenarios can have a relatively quick game when that's what suits them. The real flavor of a war in the theatre, though, comes through in the Advanced Game, where you get much more control over airpower and can more clearly see each side's strengths and weaknesses. For players who want a &quot;mini-monster game&quot; experience, playing the Advanced Game Campaign Scenarios with some or all of the optional rules will definitely &quot;deliver.&quot;<br/><br/>Ownership of Next War: Korea will NOT be required to play.<br/><br/><br/>Units<br/><br/>Ground units in Next War: Taiwan represent primarily brigades, regiments, and battalions of the armies of the two Chinas and the United States. All ground units are rated for their attack and defense strengths, movement capabilities, and unit efficiency.<br/><br/>Air units represent fighter, bomber, and attack squadrons of the major combatants and are rated for All-Weather Capabilities as well as their range, average pilot skill, and their abilities in Air-to-Air Combat, Close Air Support, and Strike missions.<br/><br/>Naval units and capabilities are abstracted somewhat in the Next War series. A &quot;Sea Control&quot; mechanism reflects the results of the surface and sub-surface battles, while the game's naval unit counters represent the major Aircraft Carrier Battle Groups and Amphibious Ready Groups of the US Navy. Additional amphibious capabilities are represented by the Special Forces capabilities of each side. Changes to the naval system include<br/><br/>     Naval Display Play Aid to allow for movement, air ranges, etc. in the seas surrounding Taiwan<br/>     a Submarine Threat Level and ASW Level matrix for the PRC and Allies respectively to represent the subsurface conflict<br/>     naval mine warfare allowing either side to attempt to deny usage of Beaches for Amphibious Assaults or Ports and Beachheads for Sea Transport<br/>     anti-Naval Strikes (including Cruise Missiles) allowing each side to force enemy Naval units to withdraw or risk losses<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Maps and Terrain<br/><br/>The game's map presents the island of modern-day Taiwan at a scale of roughly 7.5 miles per hex. The map covers the entire island and includes several holding boxes and tracking displays.<br/><br/><br/>Game System<br/><br/>A game turn is generally composed of:<br/><br/>Weather Determination. Bad weather can severely hamper air and naval operations activity and can significantly slow ground operations.<br/><br/>Initiative Determination and Air/Naval Phase, wherein Air Superiority levels and air availability are determined and Sea Control is established or modified.<br/><br/>Special Operations Phases in the Advanced Game allowing players to utilize their special operators in various recon and raid missions behind enemy lines.<br/><br/>Strike Phases in the Advanced Game allowing players to launch air strikes, cruise missiles, and artillery and SSM strikes.<br/><br/>One or more Movement and Combat Phases that allow both sides to move, react, and fight, with an advantage to the Initiative player on non-Contested turns<br/><br/>Arrival of Reinforcements and Replacements<br/>Victory Determination<br/><br/>Combat resolution examines not only unit strengths but also unit efficiency (representing training, doctrine, and morale), as well as the terrain where the combat takes place. The CRT tends to be very bloody in nature, reflecting what we believe will be a degree of attritional warfare early due to the lethality of modern weapons. As in many games, casualties represent not only actual combat losses but also losses of unit cohesion brought about by the rapid pace with which modern armies are able to engage and exploit on the battlefield.<br/><br/><br/>Scenarios<br/><br/>There are several Standard Game scenarios. The first three are small and cover the first weeks of the war by dividing the island into roughly three equal sections. These focus on the initial assaults by the PRC to establish beachheads and take Ports and introduce players to the basic mechanics of the system, while giving them insight into attack and defense strategies for the &quot;big game.&quot; Players can also play the entire Campaign Game which uses the entire map and all of the Standard Game rules. One other scenario is provided which examines a theoretical U.S. Amphibious landing in an attempt to take back the island.<br/><br/>The Advanced Game Scenarios come in three flavors &agrave; la NATO: The Next War in Europe: Strategic Surprise, Tactical Surprise, and Extended Buildup. This offers the players the ability to game out a variety of &quot;At Start&quot; war scenarios based on varying levels of readiness.<br/><br/>There is also an International Posture Matrix &agrave; la Flashpoint: Golan to allow players to experiment with a variety of intervention options for the non-Chinese players in the region.<br/><br/>In addition, there is a full set of rules covering how to play a combined Next War: Taiwan/Korea game.<br/><br/>In Next War: Taiwan, the Taiwan Straits are on fire with the Goliath of the PRC arrayed against the David of the ROC. Can you, as the People's Liberation Army/Naval commander, conquer the separatist rebels in four weeks before the full might of the U.S. can be brought to bear? Can you, as the Republic of China's Army commander, hold out against the renewed Communist assault until help arrives? And what will happen in Korea while all this is going on?

These range from killing the most zombies to throwing the least weapons. Some also change certain game-play elements. Players can win money and have choice of who plays first by excelling within these different events and winning places above the other players.<br/><br/>Money can be used to buy revealed weapons and items from the shop stock which is restocked from a deck in the centre of the table. Players take turns to buy weapons and items. After everyone has decided to stop buying they move on to equipping items from their inventory (hand). Weapons add power to a contestant but can also be thrown at individual enemies to deal double damage. Players may also flip their chosen contestants into &quot;BOSS mode&quot; once per game and deal double damage with their contestant and all weapons they control. Items tend to be one use effects such as gaining health, destroying another item/weapon or sending attacking zombies towards another player. Any items and weapons equipped during an event are lost at the end of the round, so players must be tactical when deciding which items/weapons they equip during each event.<br/><br/>Finally, all players are attacked by zombies from the top of a randomised deck which contains normal zombies, effect zombies and boss zombies. On the first event of the game each player is attacked by two zombies. This number is increased by one during each successive event. The game ends when all players but one have been killed.<br/><br/>These features alongside a deep fictional flavour, a tonne of tongue-in-cheek pop culture references and a sharp, colourful, art style combine to create a unique game experience for players to get their teeth into!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"193803": "First Edition"}, "age": "13", "name": "Jackpot!", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "average": "5.53235", "usersrated": "17", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "135838": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1531462.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"32143": {"name": "Sampo Siki\u00f6"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"32143": "Sampo Siki\u00f6"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1531462_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "Holiday Special 2012<br/><br/>The Anniversary of the founding of the Galactic Council and the related Adjusting of the Galactic Date is commonly celebrated throughout the Galaxy.

With the three armies of the Anti-French Coalition approaching from all sides the stage was set for the largest European battle until World War I, the famous Battle of the Nations.<br/><br/>Napoleon at Leipzig is a comprehensive game with a proven track record of excellent re-playability, among the most popular Napoleonic wargames of all time with 20,000 copies in print across the first 4 editions. Now it has a bigger playing area and more manpower for both sides, all working within a smooth and efficient engine of 19th-century warfare.<br/>With this edition all the units, set ups, maps, additional playing area, XIV Corps as Alternate Reinf. have been revised and brought up to the standard rules of The Library of Napoleonic Battles (vedettes, baggage trains, pontoons, cards...). <br/>Innumerable details have been added, such as the sandpit outside Leipzig and over 33% more terrain on the two mapsheets. The basic unit is still the brigade but unit strengths have been revised. Each unit now has an Initiative rating based upon the troop quality. There are now vedettes, though only for light cavalry in the first wave of units. After the board is full and the positions of the armies are known, the scouting r&ocirc;le of cavalry is over. The ever-critical baggage and pontoon trains are newly included. Perhaps the biggest game-changer is the possibility of hidden forces. But the impact, again, is limited, once the armies close for battle, by the fact that units within visual sight distance are revealed. We have bridge destruction and repair. Command works differently ... in the older version, Command was only required for Engaging with the enemy (i.e., entering EZOCs). Now units must either be In Command or make their Initiative roll to move at all.<br/><br/>The main huge battle between Napoleon&rsquo;s Grande Arm&eacute;e and the coalition of Russia, Prussia, Austria and Sweden is simulated as well as the two starting engagements at Liebertwolkwitz and Wachau-M&ouml;ckern.<br/><br/>Also included is Napoleon's last battle on German soil, when his last German ally, the Kingdom of Bavaria, changed sides and tried to block the retreating French army at Hanau. Bavarian General Wrede wasn't aware to meet Napoleon himself and the still powerful remnants of the French Army. So he offered battle, hoping to crush stranglers and routing French forces. Napoleon was said to be pleased to lecture his former Ally how to fight a real battle.

If you did, you claim one of those cards, remove the other two from play, then replace them with new cards; if not, you turn the cards face down again, and the next player tries to find a set of animals that will fulfill that same category.<br/><br/>Whoever is first to collect an agreed-upon number of animal cards wins!<br/><br/>"}, "135869": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Casus Belli (Issue 29 - Dec 1985)", "rpgproducer": {"4574": "Didier Guiserix"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1544132.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"9611": "Casus Belli"}, "rpg": {"191": "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (1st Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"193888": "First edition"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1544132_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Casus Belli #29 contains material for:<br/><br/>Operation Crusader<br/>Marita-Merkur<br/>NATO: The Next War in Europe<br/>Warhammer (English second edition)<br/>Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (1st Edition)<br/>Dungeons & Dragons (Original Edition)<br/>Pendragon<br/>James Bond 007<br/>R\u00eave de Dragon (1st & 2nd Editions)<br/><br/>"}, "135870": {"videogame": {"81554": "Deus Ex: Human Revolution"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Deus Ex: Human Revolution Director's Cut", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"212395": "English/European PlayStation 3 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2078058.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5543": "Deus Ex"}, "videogametheme": {"2281": "Cyberpunk"}, "usersrated": "19", "average": "8.13158", "videogamegenre": {"2339": "Action RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4729": "Macintosh"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"81554": "Deus Ex: Human Revolution"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2078058_t.jpg", "description": "Deus Ex: Human Revolution Ultimate Edition also contains The Missing Link downloadable content, is published by Feral Interactive and was released on April 26, 2012.<br/><br/>The game is set in 2027, 25 years before the first game in the series, at a time when multinational corporations have grown in power beyond the control of national governments.

Cool air sliding down the sides of the crevasse hit waves of heat rising from a stream of bubbling lava and formed a mist over the sluggish flow. Through the swirling clouds I caught glimpses of two ledges high above me: one was bricked, the other appeared to lead to the throne room I had been seeking.<br/><br/>A blast of fresh air cleared the mist near my feet and like a single gravestone a broken sign appeared momentarily. A dull gleam of gold showed at the base of the sign before being swallowed up by the fog again. From the distance came the angry buzz of the killer bees. Could I avoid their lethal stings as I had managed to escape the wrath of the dragon? Reading the sign might give me a clue to the dangers of this pit.<br/><br/>I approached the sign slowly.<br/><br/>And so it goes, hour after hour, as you guide your microcomputer through the Adventures of Scott Adams in an effort to amass treasures within the worlds of his imagination.<br/><br/>By definition, an adventure is a dangerous or risky undertaking; a novel, exciting, or otherwise remarkable event or experience. On your personal computer, Adventure is that and more.<br/><br/>For the user, playing adventure is a dangerous or risky undertaking in that you better be prepared to spend many addictive hours at the keyboard. If you like challenges, surprises, humor and being transported to other worlds, these are the games for you! If you dislike being forced to use your common sense and imagination, or you frustrate easily, try them anyway.<br/><br/>In beginning any Adventure, you will find yourself in a specific location: a forest, on board a small spaceship, outside a fun house, in the briefing room of a nuclear plant, in a desert, etc.<br/><br/>By using two-word commands you move from location to location manipulate objects that you find in the different places, and perform actions as if you were really there. The object of a game is to amass treasure for points or accomplish some other goal. Successfully completing a game, however, is far easier to state than to achieve. In many cases you will find a treasure but be unable to take it until you are carrying the right combination of objects you find in the various locations.<br/><br/>How do you know which objects you need? Trial and error, logic and imagination. Each time you try some action, you learn a little more about the game. Which brings us to the term &quot;game&quot; again. While called games, Adventures are actually puzzles because you have to discover which way the pieces (actions, manipulations, use of magic words, etc.) fit together in order to gather your treasures or accomplish the mission. Like a puzzle, there are a number of ways to fit the pieces together; players who have found and stores all the treasures (there are 13) of Adventure #1 may have done so in different ways.<br/><br/>In finding how the pieces fit, you will be forced to deal with unexpected events, apparent dead ends and Scott's humor, which is one of the best parts of the puzzles.<br/><br/>If you run into a barrier like not being able to discover more rooms, don't give up. Play the game with some friends; sometimes they'll think of things you haven't tried.<br/><br/>While I pondered how to reach the throne room -- which I was sure contained the treasures of Croesus -- the fog grew thicker and the hours passed. I realized I would not be able to outwit Adams today...but maybe tomorrow. I marked my present location on my tattered map and began the long trip to the surface. As I dragged myself off to bed, I thought about the other possible Adventures.<br/><br/>But enough for tonight. Tomorrow -- another crack at the chasm.<br/><br/>"}, "135874": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Shadowrun Returns", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"221315": "Android edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1732429.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2281": "Cyberpunk"}, "videogamefranchise": {"6440": "Shadowrun"}, "usersrated": "90", "average": "7.37611", "videogamegenre": {"2155": "RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"6063": "Android"}, "videogamehonor": {"35550": "2013 Global Game Awards Best Indie Game of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1732429_t.jpg", "description": "Shoot straight.

So do we!<br/><br/>Introducing Obsidian's PROJECT ETERNITY.<br/><br/>Coming in 2014 for Windows PC, Macintosh OS X, and Linux<br/><br/>Distribution via Steam and GOG (DRM-free)<br/><br/>Source: Game Website, &quot;Project Eternity&quot;<br/><br/> What is Project Eternity? <br/><br/>Project Eternity is a party-based fantasy roleplaying game inspired by the Infinity Engine games (Baldur's Gate 1 and 2, Icewind Dale 1 &amp; 2, and Planescape: Torment) set in an original world created by Obsidian Entertainment.  The camera has a fixed axonometric (high angle) perspective (with zoom!).  The environments are 2D backgrounds combined with 3D characters and visual effects.<br/> Project Eternity's team is focusing on three core ideas that will capture the Infinity Engine experiences players loved so much:<br/><br/>Unique, beautiful, dynamic environments that encourage and reward exploration.<br/><br/>A story that is both personal and far-reaching, with believable characters and factions that create compelling dilemmas for players. <br/>Fun and challenging tactical combat that can escalate in difficulty through the use of optional game modes.<br/><br/> What does &quot;party-based&quot; mean in Project Eternity? <br/><br/>At the start of the game, the player can create and customize his or her character, choosing from six races and several ethnicities, eleven classes, and a number of cultural backgrounds.  Over the course of the game, the player can expand his or her party up to six total characters.  The additional characters include eight companions designed and written by Obsidian as well as any new characters players would like to build at the Adventurer's Hall.<br/><br/> What is the combat like? <br/><br/>Project Eternity's combat will feel very similar to the combat in the Infinity Engine games, which used a &quot;real-time with pause&quot; system. In such a system, events between combatants occur simultaneously, but the player can pause the game at any time. The player selects and commands one or more of his or her party members to issue orders, ranging from continuous activities, like making standard attacks, to the activation of limited-use tactical abilities, such as spells.<br/><br/>Like the Infinity Engine games, Project Eternity will support auto-pause features that allow players to establish conditions under which the game will automatically pause (e.g., if a party member becomes unconscious). It will also feature a slow combat toggle that can be used with or in lieu of the pause feature. In slow combat, players can manage the flow of combat without needing to halt the game entirely.<br/><br/>What are the different races we can play? <br/><br/>Players can select from six main races found in this part of the world: humans, elves, dwarves, orlans, aumaua, and godlike. Orlans, aumaua, and godlike are unique to the world of Project Eternity, though godlike have similarities to &quot;planetouched&quot; races in other settings. Orlans are small humanoids physically notable for their two-tone skin, extensive body hair, and extremely long ears. Aumaua are large, semiaquatic humanoids with a diverse array of skin patterns, elongated heads, and semi-webbed hands and feet.<br/><br/>Godlike are not a separate race, but a phenomenon found among all races. They are individuals whom many people believe were transformed by the gods before birth. Godlike have distinctive appearances that invariably make them stand out from other people, with different cultures and individuals holding wildly different biases toward or against them.<br/><br/>All of the races have different ethnicities from which the player can choose. For elves, Wood and Pale, for dwarves, Mountain and Boreal, for orlans, Hearth and Wild, and for aumaua, Island and Coastal. Humans have three ethnicities: Meadow, Ocean, and Savannah. Godlike can be found among any race and their appearance always sets them apart from their parents.<br/><br/> What about the classes? <br/><br/>Characters may be one of eleven classes: barbarian, chanter, cipher, druid, fighter, monk, paladin, priest, ranger, rogue, or wizard.  The &quot;core four&quot; classes (fighter, priest, rogue, wizard) are most similar to their traditional tabletop analogues.  The non-core classes, barbarians, druids, monks, paladins, and rangers, are somewhat similar to their counterparts but differ more significantly.  The two completely new classes are the chanter and the cipher, which are unique to the world of Project Eternity.<br/><br/> <br/>Traditional classes vary in how high- or low-maintenance they are based on their traditional counterparts.  E.g. fighters are generally lower maintenance than wizards.  However, the advancement system allows players to bend those roles, making higher-maintenance, active-use fighters or more passive wizards (for example).  Class balance is important to us, but we also want playing each class to feel distinctive and complementary to other classes.<br/>  What will the art style be like? <br/><br/>Our art style is fairly realistic and uses a somewhat subdued, natural color palette, especially in outdoor environments.  Character proportions are also fairly realistic.  Equipment designs and proportions are based on their earthly historical counterparts, with an overall emphasis on function in their form.  However, because this is a fantasy game, many environments will also be fantastic, with unearthly architecture, unusual materials, brilliant colors, and beautiful embellishments when appropriate.<br/>  How about the setting and story? <br/><br/>Project Eternity is set in a world created by Obsidian Entertainment, where mortal souls are bound to an eternal, and often mystifying, cycle of life and reincarnation believed to be watched over by the gods.  Though cultures and individuals have different beliefs about the nature and purpose of this cycle, it is only recently that mortals have made significant advancements in understanding its fundamental mechanics through the science of animancy.<br/><br/><br/>The story takes place in a small nation in the world's southern hemisphere called the Dyrwood (DEER-wood).  The Dyrwood is a heavily forested, coastal region where colonial powers from across the ocean have settled and formed an uneasy relationship with the local residents, tribes of orlans and elves who are protective of the ancient ruins of E&iacute;r Glanfath on the forest's interior.  E&iacute;r Glanfath was an ancient melting pot of races that built elaborate, often massive, structures out of a living shell-like substance called adra.  Though the fate of the ancient Glanfathans is unknown, their dangerous and complex ruins show evidence they possessed extensive knowledge of how souls work.  For this reason, all of the surrounding colonial powers aggressively fight for the chance to explore and plunder Glanfathan structures, often bringing the local tribes into conflict with their relatively new neighbors -- and the neighbors into conflict with each other.<br/><br/> <br/>The central character in the story is a newcomer to the Dyrwood, a man or woman who is caught up in a bizarre supernatural phenomenon.  This event puts them in a difficult position, where they must explore the new world to solve a series of problems that have been thrust upon them.<br/>  What engine does Project Eternity use? <br/><br/>Project Eternity uses the Unity engine in addition to proprietary features developed at Obsidian.<br/>  What platforms will Project Eternity be available on? <br/><br/>We will be releasing Project Eternity for Windows, Mac, and Linux PCs.  It will be available through Steam and GOG.com.<br/>  Will Project Eternity use any form of DRM (digital rights management)? <br/><br/>The GOG version is DRM-free. The Steam version works like any other Steam game and does not have any added DRM. There is no online requirement to play the game nor any additional DRM imposed by us.<br/> What languages will you be supporting? <br/><br/>In addition to English, Project Eternity will be released in French, German, Spanish, Polish, and Russian.<br/> What resolutions are you supporting? <br/><br/>Project Eternity will support resolutions from 1280x720 and up.  Our environments are rendered out at a high resolution and support a wide range of scalability.<br/> What other cool stuff will be in the game? <br/><br/>Thanks to our backers, players will have access to both a player house as well as a full stronghold in the game.  Also, players will have the chance to explore all fifteen levels of the backer-funded mega-dungeon, the Endless Paths of Od Nua.  Players who want a more extreme challenge can enable up to three optional game modes: Expert Mode (turns off &quot;helper&quot; features), Path of the Damned (dramatically increases the difficulty and complexity of encounters), and Trial of Iron (only one save game, party death = game over, save game deleted).<br/><br/>"}, "135893": {"boardgamedesigner": {"4022": {"name": "Robert G.

He was respected as a fair justice. His stories are popular in Chinese people.<br/><br/>In each turn, a player plays a card facedown and draw a card. Players in this game would play different roles. The First player who play the Emperor become Emperor (play Emperor faceup). Then Emperor have to call out Bao Qing Tian. Other players who have Bao Qing Tian card can play it to become Bao Qing Tian. The Bao Qing Tian have to decide which player(s) are the police, Wang Zhao(\u738b\u671d) and Ma Han(\u99ac\u6f22), depending on their cards. AS soon as the officers are decided, The Emperor says which kind of criminals he want to get rid of (there are 4 kinds of offenders). Then the police can look at one player's hand when his turn is or catch other players' cards when they discard. Bao Qing Tian have to count the times when the police searches, but the limit is 10 searches. If the police arrests the criminal, Bao Qing Tian decides how to punish the player who holds the criminal. Otherwise, the police is punished. For example, a punishment may require player to sing a song, make a funny face, etc. At this time, if players have the mathematical symbols (add, plus, subtract, minus), they can help or afflict the criminal. Sometimes the criminal would have those symbolic cards and he can help himself. If the criminal is the Emperor, he can cancel his punishment (this is the dark side of this game).<br/><br/>"}, "135938": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Sonic the Hedgehog: Pocket Adventure", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"194010": "North American Neo Geo Pocket Color edition"}, "average": "8", "videogameseries": {"4728": "Sonic the Hedgehog"}, "videogametheme": {"2471": "Animals"}, "videogamefranchise": {"4878": "Sonic the Hedgehog"}, "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "videogameplatform": {"5751": "Neo Geo Pocket Color"}, "usersrated": "1", "poll": {}, "description": "Sonic the Hedgehog Pocket Adventure is a platform video game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series.

Most have Hit Dice that increase by one per age level, a few do not. Some have hit dice that constantly increase, and some decrease after a certain level to represent the weaknesses of aging (I call these &ldquo;elder age&rdquo; charts). Some creatures can have multiple age charts, which represents changes in diet, habitat, proximity of other specific creatures, or exposure to certain elements, such as heat or radiation. In most cases, once a creature has started its path down one chart, it is restricted to that chart for its entire life. In rare cases a mutant can change growth charts but this means they have to survive exposure to an extreme of something, which could include radiation, chemicals, parasites, or disease. And, finally, there are those mutants that go through metamorphosis and have one or more age charts (e.g., a larval form might have one age chart and the adult form another).<br/><br/>"}, "135944": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Wisdom from the Wastelands (Issue 3 - Feb 15, 2012)", "rpgproducer": {"66028": "Robert Gruver"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1524720.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"21074": "Wisdom from the Wastelands"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"94544": "Editorial"}, "rpg": {"1654": "Mutant Future"}, "rpgissueversion": {"194017": "PDF"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1524720_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Issue #3: High-Tech Weapons<br/><br/>Like magical weapons in fantasy games, high technology firearms are treasures that adventurers seek out with great eagerness in the post-apocalyptic world.
