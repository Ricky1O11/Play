The remnants of the dead man&rsquo;s squad are nowhere to be seen&mdash;scattered in nearby houses and gutters&mdash;all thoughts the advance abandoned with the stunned demise or their leader...the compulsion for revenge obviously overcome by their instinct for self-preservation. Off to the right, Kruger&rsquo;s own men have located the source of the lethal shot and are laying down a steady stream of fire on the church steeple directly ahead. The absence of responding fire suggests that the lone Russian marksman has beat a hasty retreat of been victimized by the withering fire of the German retort. Kruger has seen enough. He is to occupy the church and set up a regimental observation post at once. His orders leave no leeway for delays by a single sniper. He gives the signal to rush the building. Obedient their training, his men, veterans of France, the Balkans, and 18 months of fighting in Russia, spring to their feet. Seconds later the sharp, staccato retort of a Russian machinegun concludes the assertiveness of death itself that this time Kruger was wrong...<br/><br/>This is Squad Leader...a game of WWII tactical combat in Europe. Now you make the instant decisions resulting in life or death for your men, victory or defeat for your army...for YOU are the Squad Leader. YOU direct the fire against your squad, select your plan of attack, or set your defenses against massed Russian human wave or armour assaults. Will that hedgerow provide adequate cover for your flanking efforts, or will your men be cut down by the American machinegun position in the woods? The decision is irrevocable and yours alone. You must live or die by the results.<br/><br/>Squad Leader utilizes programmed instruction to guide you through 12 scenarios of increasing realism and complexity. The scenarios run the gamut from street fighting in Stalingrad to armoured advances across snow covered roads in the Ardennes. A Campaign Game ties the individual scenarios together and allows you own personal leader counter to advance in rank and ability. In addition, a &ldquo;Design You Own&rdquo; section is included so that players can create an unlimited number of play situations of their own creation.<br/><br/>Each hex in Squad Leader represents 40 meters or real terrain with counters representing individual leaders, support weapons, and vehicles of 4 man crews and 12 man squads. Each game turn is divided into two player turns with 8 phases, equivalent to two minutes of actual time.<br/><br/>Squad Leader is more than just a game, it is a game system which can be used to portray any WWII infantry action. Its innovative system does for infantry combat what Panzerblitz and Panzer Leader have done for armoured warfare games. Squad Leader provides innovative rules for morale, leadership, machineguns, flamethrowers, demo charges, smoke, hidden placement, sewer movement, off-board artillery, radio contact, anti-tank guns, night actions, wire, entrenchments, mines, bunkers, rubble, multi-story building differentiation, fire, river crossings, roadblocks, mortars, and much more.<br/><br/>Be forewarned!

It was invented in New Zealand, and is clearly derived from the earlier Psyche-paths/Kaliko. Tantrix can be played as solitaire puzzles, ranging from easy to almost impossible, or as a multiplayer strategy game featuring a combination of strategy, luck and skill. Each tile has three tracks on it, in three different colors (out of four colors). Each track starts on one side of the tile and ends on another. The goal of the game is to create the longest line or loop of your chosen color. If you create a closed loop, each tile counts for two points.<br/><br/>Each player has an open hand of six tiles. When it is your turn, you must first play tiles in any spaces that are &quot;required play&quot; (any hole that has at least three tiles bordering it is a required play). After each played tile, you randomly draw a new tile. Once you've filled all required spaces, you play one tile in any legal space. After that, you once again need to fill required spaces. To play the game well, you need to create required spaces in smart ways. This way you can both enable yourself to play more tiles during your turn and force your opponent to play tiles that continue your track (remember that your opponent's hand is open, so try to create required spaces that take advantage of his tiles).<br/><br/>The full version contains 56 tiles.<br/><br/>Note that there are also smaller solo brain teaser puzzles that are Outside the Scope of BGG. The 10-tile version is a color matching puzzle. Arrange the tiles so that all the colored lines match where the tiles touch each other.

The game comes with multilingual rules (english, spanish, italian, german and french) and instructions to build 10 different F1 circuits.<br/>Each player must set the gear and roll an appropriate number of special dice, that determine the speed of the car and the fuel consuption. The game is turn based and the phasing player, after moving his car, must set the gear for next turn. The box strategy is the most important decision to take. You can decide to complete all the 3 laps without stopping or making one or two pitstops.<br/>The game is not a &quot;simulation&quot;, but to win you need a good amount of skill. Even if the speed of your car is determined by dice, you have to choose carefully the &quot;braking point&quot; in order to enter the curves at the best speed. If you exceed the curve's speed limit, you lose &quot;tyres points&quot;. Of course, you can simulate a championship playing different circuits. What's interesting is that the game strategy changes from circuit to circuit and if you design your own circuit you need all your &quot;driving skill&quot; to be competitive. Rookies can win, but they will find very hard to beat a skilled player.<br/>Game components: 65 tiles to build the circuits (an avarege of 25 tiles are needed for each circuit), 6 plastic sport cars, 12 special dice, 6 &quot;dashboards&quot;, 40 speed limit tokens, 24 plastic pawns, one rules booklet.<br/><br/>"}, "1044": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic184259.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"19": {"name": "Richard Hamblen"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1982", "maxplayers": "7", "boardgameartist": {"2652": "Charles Kibler"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5": {"name": "The Avalon Hill Game Co"}}, "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic184259_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1055": {"name": "American West"}}, "description": "&quot;Fill Yore Hand ...&quot; with Gunslinger, the game of western gunfights. In Gunslinger, you play the part of a western character who is caught in a sudden gunfight, and you face the split-second decisions and incidents of the showdown as bullets start to fly.<br/><br/>Gunslinger is based on a quick and easy game system that recreates the split-second nature of gunplay. Each turn the players secretly play cards to define exactly what they will do during the next two seconds in the game. Then they step through these actions on the playing map, resolving each shot in the split-second when it takes place. Gunslinger resolves combat quickly and easily. The attacker draws a result card that shows exactly where his shot hits, which combines with his gun to determine the damage he inflicts. This recreates the critical differences between weapons: Winchesters, Shotguns, Buffalo rifles, Colt's &quot;Peacemaker&quot;, Smith &amp; Wesson's breakopen guns and Remington's Derringer are a few of the guns in the game.<br/><br/>Gunslinger includes eight two-sided boards (a total of sixteen map faces) portraying town and countryside terrain at a scale of six feet per hex. These boards can be assembled in varying ways to create a vast number of different maps that are used in the gunfights. The terrain includes gullies, hills, trees, watering troughs, wells, hitching posts and the interiors of buildings.<br/><br/>Gunslinger presents 26 different gunfights and several hundred variations, including both historical gunfights and made-up situations. Wild Bill Hickok, Billy the Kid, Wyatt Earp, and John Wesley Hardin are just a few of the real gunslingers of history who appear in re-creations of the gunfights that made them famous.  Indian raids, barroom brawls and poker games are just a few of the hypothetical situations.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"24523": "Avalon Hill edition"}, "average": "7.0714", "name": "Gunslinger", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2689": "Action / Movement Programming"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "864", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}}, "1045": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic51495.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1130": {"name": "Gerhard E.

They place two balls on each figure. They now take turns and choose one of the following three actions.<br/><br/>1.Move: Players can move the chosen piece as many squares sideways, forwards or backwards as the piece has balls, if it has 4 balls it must move 4 squares. The pieces may neither jump nor change direction.<br/><br/>2.Sharing: Players may take all the balls from a selected piece and place one each on any of their other pieces. Exception, if a tower has six balls only five balls may be placed on the other five pieces and so one ball is lost and is removed from the game.<br/><br/>3.Capturing: Only balls are captured, not pieces. The capturing piece and the threatened piece stay on their own squares. Example a white piece and a brown piece stand two squares apart. They have two balls and three balls respectively. It is whites move and white can remove the three brown balls from the game as long as there is no piece between the white and brown pieces. Pieces whose balls have been captured can be activated again by the sharing of balls.<br/><br/>Therefore, capturing only limits the movement possibilities, the number of pieces always remains the same.

Momo finds out that spooky 'grey men'  are tempting people to bring them their time to save it in a time savings bank.  In fact they are stealing their time.  The more time they save, the colder, sadder, more hurried and poor their existence becomes.<br/><br/>Finally with the help of a wonder flower and Master Hora's advice, Momo and Kassiopeia the tortoise, try to beat the grey men and give the people back their time.<br/><br/><br/>Momo and Kassiopeia must find the way to Master Hora and meet each other at the gate to the never-alley.<br/>But how?  Momo has a dream.  She sees a picture which shows the way.  Kassiopeia also has a dream.  It is as if she goes along a dream street and after a long time meets Momo at the gate to the never-alley.<br/><br/>First, the players split into two groups.<br/>One group takes the yellow Momo figure, all the cards with the yellow edges and one half of the board.<br/>The other group takes the brown Kassiopeia figure, all the cards with brown edges and the other half of the board.<br/>IMPORTANT:<br/>The two groups don't play against each other, but with one and other.  Each group respects the other and doesn&rsquo;t make things too difficult or too easy.<br/><br/>The start of the game<br/><br/>The two groups sit apart from each other so that they cannot see the other half of the board, preferably on two separate tables.<br/><br/>Each group sorts their cards.  The green cards and the grey cards are separated.   At first only the green cards are used, as well as the Gigi and Beppo cards.<br/><br/>Each Group now lays a selected card, with a dream picture showing,  on a space on the board.  But not on one of the three approaches to the never-alley.  This card is the start square.  Momo and Kassiopeia are placed here on their respective boards.<br/><br/>For the first game the path should not be more than ten cards long.  See the illustration.<br/><br/>The story telling begins<br/><br/>In turn each group tells the other a story, involving the dream pictures on the chosen path.  For each question mark on the path, the group thinks up their own imaginary picture.<br/>The other group listens carefully and tries to remember the story.<br/><br/>After the two stories have been told, the grey cards are placed on the empty squares of the board (colored pictures face up). The whole board is now full of dream pictures and question marks, and the original path is no longer clear.<br/><br/>The two groups come together and put the two halves of the board together.  Each group now positions itself by the other half of the board and will soon move the figure which goes with that half.<br/><br/>Momo and Kassiopeia run through the city<br/><br/>At last Momo and Kassiopeia set off.  Each group moves their figure in turn onto an adjacent space.  It is important that all the players should participate by recalling the story they heard and they should all agree which space the figure should move to.<br/>Before either Momo or Kassiopeia are placed on a new card, the card is turned over.  If the underside is green the card remains turned and the figure steps onto it.  But if it is grey, the world ,once again, becomes a little colder, and an hour flower is taken to the time-store of the grey men.  Master Hora's flower is left until last.<br/>Momo and Kassiopeia may not step on the grey cards.<br/><br/>Gigi and Beppo help Momo and Kassiopeia.  If a group finds one of the friends, this group may expose any chosen card.  In this case no flower need be given up if the chosen card is grey.<br/><br/>When Momo or Kassiopeia reach the gate to the never-alley,  they wait there for each other and go together to Master Hora.  Master Hora gives them his flower and so Momo and Kassiopeia free all the captured flowers.  The flowers are given back to the people.  Together you have won the game.  If Master Hora has to give up his flower to the grey men no more can be done.

If a rule cannot be followed, the scroll is burned in the fire - that is, removed from the game.  Examples include, &quot;Each player must put three plums in the garden,&quot; if at least one player has fewer than three plums.  Or, &quot;The player with the most plums must give all other players a plum,&quot; if two or more players are tied for having the most plums.<br/><br/>Players take turns reading the scrolls they wish, enacting the new laws, all of which involve plum distribution in some way.  You don't have to enact any of your scrolls unless you have more than five, at which point you MUST activate (or burn, if illegal) enough to bring your hand down to five cards.  A player then draws a scroll, reads it silently, and auctions it off without telling the others what's on it.  He may bid for it himself.<br/><br/>The game ends when either all scrolls are taken or when the text of a read scroll requires the game to end.

On a turn, the active player takes one sand and one water card from his hand to create mud, then hurls it at another player. (Again, not literally...) That player has a chance to defend herself by playing umbrella cards to block either the sand or water or both, or by playing special cards that, for example, redirect the mud back to the thrower or spread it out on all other players. Other players can add to someone's attack in order to make the perfect mix of mud &ndash; e.g., adding a 1-value water to a muddy mix of 5-value sand and 4-value water &ndash; and by making the perfect mix, they get to redirect the attack at any player.<br/><br/>After the mudball hits its target or splats on someone's shield, each player refills her hand to seven cards, then the player who was hit in the previous round starts the new round by choosing a target and throwing.

The object of the game is to win the pot which contains all the bets the players have made in a deal.  Players are dealt cards which are usually reduced to a Poker hand of five (5) cards. Betting and bluffing are used in rounds until all bets are squared up, or until all other players have conceded the pot (folded). If all bets have been squared up, the rounds are followed by a &quot;showdown&quot; in which all hands are fully revealed; the one with the best combination of a Poker hand of five (5) cards being the winner.<br/><br/>The following table describes and ranks the standard Poker hands:<br/><br/>Five of a Kind (Only if wild cards are in use):  Four cards of the same rank and one wild card (eg: A, A, A, A, Joker).<br/>Straight Flush: A straight with all cards of the same suit (eg: A, K, Q, J, 10: all spades). (The highest Straight Flush is nominally called a Royal Flush)<br/>Four of a Kind:  Four cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, A, A, K).<br/>Full House:  Three of a kind in one rank and a pair in a different rank (eg: A, A, A, K, K). <br/>Flush:  Five cards of the same suit (eg: A, K, Q, J, 9: all spades)<br/>Straight:  Five cards in sequence of rank (eg: A, K, Q, J, 10).<br/>Three of a Kind:  Three cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, A, K, Q).<br/>Two Pair:  Two pairs of different ranks (eg: A, A, K, K, Q).<br/>One Pair:  A pair of cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, K, Q, J).<br/>High Card:  High card without any other higher combination (eg: A, K, Q, J, 9).<br/><br/>Poker has many variants.  The two main forms of Poker are: Stud Poker and Draw Poker.<br/><br/>In Draw Poker, all cards are dealt face down to each player.  One of the most played  versions of Draw Poker is Five (5) card Draw Poker (often shown in TV and Motion Pictures).  Each player is dealt five (5) cards.  There is a betting interval, and those left in the deal, may trade cards in their hand for new cards from the stock (IE: Discard two cards, and receive two new cards from the dealer).  There is then a final betting interval before the showdown.<br/><br/>In Stud Poker, some of the cards are dealt face down, and some are exposed for all players to see.  One of the most common games of Stud Poker is Seven (7) card Stud Poker.  Each player is dealt two cards face down and one card face up.  After the first betting interval, each remaining player is dealt another card face up.  This continues two more times, with a betting interval before each deal, until all players that remain have two cards face down, and four cards face up.  Each player then receives a final card face down, and there is a final betting interval before the showdown.<br/><br/>Currently, one of the most popular versions of Poker is a version of Stud Poker called Texas Hold'Em.<br/><br/>No-Limit Texas Hold'Em is the version used in The World Series of Poker each year.  Each player is dealt two cards face down.  After a betting interval, three community cards are dealt face up at the same time.  There is another betting interval, and another community card is dealt face up; after another betting interval, another community card is dealt face up.

If you roll the exact distance between two hunters, they shoot each other (if both aiming at the hare -- otherwise, only the one not aiming at the hare is shot) - remove the hunters.

Players are big investors (and I mean big - the smallest notes are $50 million and billions of dollars change hands) and wheeler-dealers.<br/><br/>Players acquire shares in companies, primarily randomly (picked up as cards), but also possibly through purchase of other players' previous sales. To form the companies they must also acquire resources, which are bought from 4 sets. The pricing mechanism for these is like Palmyra and McMulti - each purchase increases the price and each sale decreases it. Once an appropriate set is acquired for a matching set of (at least two) shares in a company, the company can be formed. Companies pay income to their owners each turn. They can also be sold off at a premium, or split up (provided the owner has enough shares and resources) to gain double income. The real heart of the game comes in the option to conduct hostile takeovers. A player lays one or more shares in a company owned by another player and then starts a bidding war to takeover the company. Each player is bidding to buy the shares of the opponent (bids are per share). The &quot;winner&quot; gets the company and all the shares, the &quot;loser&quot; is paid off at the final bid price. Who is actually the winner and loser depends, of course, on the balance of the final price.<br/><br/>There is a sudden death variable finish, when assets plummet in value, so there is a tense few final rounds when players can try to realize assets while they are still valuable.

Spring in the hight country enters with a wash of fresh green and the warming chinook, while the show still lies deep on the mountain peaks. As the snow recedes, wild flowers of every hue splash across the lush meadows of the Northern Rockies. The small life in burrow and den creep forth, the birds sing loudly in the pines. Spring is the true beginning of the new year in the awakening wilderness of the Yellowstone.<br/><br/>The old buck raises his head and turns his gaze to the horizon. The time has come - now to lead the herd to the summer pasture where the bounty of this land will drive away the hunger of winter past. But other animals have come forth from their dens with the spring - the coyote, grizzly bear, mountain lion, and the deadliest predator of all - Man. The natural dangers of this magnificent, rugged land loom ahead. Yet the herd, to prosper, must take to the well-worn trail, seeking to cross the migratory paths of the other grazing masses. As the young gambol and explore, every instinct of the old buck must be devoted to the trek. Without hesitation, he takes the first step toward the future.<br/><br/>Yellowstone is a less complex game dealing with moving your herd from Winter Pasturage to Summer Pasturage back to Winter Pasturage.  Players control one of the following herds: bison, elk, sheep, or mule deer.  Along the way, you try to pick up Food Points and avoid predators.  You can move the animals in your herd a certain number of hexes in a turn; males are the fastest, females are a bit slower, babies are really slow and should be accompanied by females.

Each player draws one randomly at game start.<br/><br/>In Cosmic Eidex, the idea is to take either the most points or the least points (designated by the trump and rank of the cards that you take each hand), to earn a victory point. If in a hand, one player exceeds 100 card points, then the other two players get 1 victory point each. If one player takes all of the tricks, she receives 2 victory points. Seven victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>Cosmic Eidex is a mutation of the ages-old Swiss trick-taking card game Jass. Like Skat, the traditional German trick-taking card game, it is a three-player game.<br/><br/>The Cosmic-like powers each player is given are relatively weak. Most allow the player to break one of the rules once per game (before, during or after), some can be used multiple times. You don&rsquo;t need to know every characters' powers, just the powers of the three characters used in the current game.

The game board shows four distinct areas associated with the four elements (air, water, fire, earth).

A player can have a maximum of two cards in their hands, and they have to be different types (e.g., no 2 element cards). On their turn, a player rolls the special dice, showing both a symbol and a number. If the salamander is rolled as the symbol, the player gets to pick up a card. If the stone symbol is rolled, the player <br/>marks one of the possible positions on the board represented by their cards on the board. In any case, the player moves their pawn according to the number rolled.<br/><br/>If another player reaches a space with another player's marker, they can ask that player for a specific card. The player has to show the questioner a Yes/No card to indicate their answer.<br/><br/>Once a player knows a set of cards, they move their pawn back to their own starting location. Upon arrival, the player states the set of cards and who has the missing card(s). If the statement is true, the player receives a number of points; if not, they end up in the dungeon.
