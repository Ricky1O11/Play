The events, however, take place hundreds of years before Gloomhaven and depict the original construction of the city.<br/><br/>In Founders of Gloomhaven, players will use worker-placement mechanics to place resource buildings on the map of the city, use these resources to create more advanced resources, and then deliver them to proposed building sites to earn influence. An individual player, however, cannot do everything on their own, because they can only import a small number of resource types, depending on their race. To create more advanced resources, they will have to work with other players.<br/><br/>The game also features an auction mechanic where players will vote at the beginning of each round to determine what new building proposals come out and where they are placed on the board. Players can even add workers to their vote to increase its strength, but they should be careful. Workers added to the vote cannot be used for the rest of the round, and the more workers a player bids, the worse position they will get in the turn order.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "6.33333", "name": "Founders of Gloomhaven", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Route/Network Building", "Tile Placement", "Variable Player Powers", "Worker Placement"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "9", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 75 - Interview with Cephalofair Games Isaac Childres"]}, "214033": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jason C.

It was foretold that one day the Great Dragon King, Sho-Riu would return to destroy the Earth, and only they could stop him. When the meteor came from the heavens and devastated the mountain, the Dragon King came with it. For generations the monks had been training for this moment, and as Sho-Riu descended on the temple, they gathered their strength and prepared to fulfill their destiny.<br/><br/>But their victory was not to be. Reigning down death and destruction, the Dragon King broke through the monk&rsquo;s defenses and utterly destroyed the order, devouring their souls and bringing Darkness and shadow into the sacred temple. Those few that survived were scattered and leaderless, but they would not sit idle. Traveling the roads and countryside, the last of the monks dedicated their lives to finding new Heroes that could one day fulfill the prophecy and reclaim&hellip; the Temple of Shadows!<br/><br/>Building on the themes from the Forbidden Fortress Core Set, the Temple of Shadows Deluxe Expansion adds a ton of new content for the Feudal Japan setting and the Belly of the Beast OtherWorld. This boxed set includes:<br/>4 New Hero Classes<br/><br/>Enforcer &ndash; An outlaw and a gangster, the Enforcer is an anti-Hero renegade who favors brute strength and intimidation over elegant fighting weapons and technique. His tattooed body is hardened and scarred from a lifetime of brutal brawling.<br/><br/>Geisha &ndash; Beautiful but deadly, the Geisha is a cunning and stealthful fighter. She employs deception and trickery to evade and confuse enemies, while slashing with her hidden blade from behind. Her comforting presence can heal the Heroes, both body and soul, to keep them in the fight.<br/><br/>Soldier &ndash; The Soldier is a veteran of warfare who has seen many battles and is an expert marksman with his Rifle. Though he does not have the style or family heritage of the Samurai, he is a hardened foot soldier that has access to a variety of different weapons and training.<br/><br/>Kitsune &ndash; A guardian spirit, the Kitsune has come forward to defend this world against the demons and creatures that would threaten to destroy it. Taking on a human-fox form, the Kitsune uses supernatural tricks and auras to protect the Heroes, while darting between enemies to deliver killing blows with her deadly blades.<br/>4 New Enemy Types<br/><br/>Chochinobake &ndash; These demon-possessed, animated lanterns swarm the Heroes, relentlessly biting and burning them with terrifying speed.<br/><br/>Takobake Warriors &ndash; Once a noble clan, the Takobake have embraced the power of the Dark Stone. Using its energy to grow in strength, they have become mutated into tentacled monstrosities, twisted and evil.<br/><br/>Skin Crawlers &ndash; These large, parasitic creatures burrow through the flesh and muscle walls in the Belly of the Beast, rising up from the pools of sticky mucus to assault any Heroes foolish enough to enter into their feeding grounds.<br/><br/>The Fallen Shogun &ndash; This dreadful leader of the Takobake clan was one of the first to discover the magical properties of the Dark Stone. Weaving it into his armor, and forging it into weapons, he has gone mad with power, mutating into a giant among men! Declaring himself Shogun, he now sweeps across the land with his legions of mutated soldiers, conquering any who would stand in his way.<br/>New Material for the Forbidden Fortress and Belly of the Beast<br/><br/>This expansion also features 4 new double-sided Map Tiles with new rooms for the Forbidden Fortress on one side and the Belly of the Beast on the other, 6 New Missions for the Temple of Shadows, loads of new cards and counters, and much more!<br/><br/>"}, "214034": {"poll": [], "name": "Prehistorik: the card game", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "2017", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3268300_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3268300.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Prehistoric"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>The time of a game, players put themselves in the shoes of a homo sapiens clan leader and send their hunters to seek food for the tribe.

The player has just inherited a semi legal weapons smuggling business from a father he hardly knew.<br/><br/>Thrust into a fascinating and dangerous world of international intrigue, massive wealth, powerful weapons, bigger than life personalities and the ever present looming possibility of prison or death. Your inheritance consists of $10 million dollars, a high tech untraceable laptop, and a single friendly connection to show you the ropes.<br/><br/>You must work fast to restore the family empire to it&rsquo;s greatness before the competition or the agencies can move in and crush you. You must be cunning, confident, persuasive and always one step ahead.<br/><br/>As you prove your competence and build lasting relationships you will gain access to the &ldquo;excess&rdquo; weapon stores of the 10 biggest weapon suppliers in the world. You will then be able to smuggle these weapons to consumers who are unable to acquire them through official channels due to politics, embargoes, or a lack of infrastructure. If this doesn&rsquo;t prove profitable enough for you you may consider meddling in international geopolitics by employing a private agency that your father once used. A successful entrepreneur shouldn&rsquo;t dismiss the idea of instigating a civil war or armed conflict in the name of pursuing greater profits.<br/><br/>Of course, these actions will no doubt draw the attention of the various law enforcement agencies who makes it their mission to track down smugglers like yourself and competing arms dealers. Before you can worry about the competition, you need to handle the law.<br/><br/>To avoid the authorities you can bribe cargo captains and pilots to hide your wares amongst their shipments of food, disaster relief supplies and industrial goods. Alternatively, once you have built a healthy reserve of cash you can enter the world of private fleet ownership. Barges, various cargo aircraft, even submarines can all be had for the right price if you know the right people. These vehicles will allow you to choose your own destinations and schedules, although it is only a matter of time before these vehicles are tied to ongoing investigations.<br/><br/>Opposing arms dealers are constantly battling you for access to the best and most profitable weapon supplies around the globe. Sometimes things get out of hand and friendly competition turns to sabotage, theft and collusion. Tampering with the engines on your rivals ships is one thing, hiring pirates is another. Do you dare take it all the way and work with one of your enemies, the agencies, to take down your rival for good? You will need to balance all of these factors when deciding on your strategy for becoming the more successful than your legendary father.<br/><br/>You are now an Arms Dealer and everything that comes with it.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "214130": {"poll": [], "name": "Industry Empire", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "4", "videogametheme": ["Business/Construction"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["rondomedia Marketing & Vertriebs GmbH"], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["ActaLogic"], "description": "In &ldquo;Industry Empire&rdquo; you are the boss of all bosses.

It is a sequel to the 2002 game Warrior Kings and was released March 21, 2003 in Europe and September 30, 2003 in North America.<br/><br/>The story is set 100 years after the first Warrior Kings where the Empire of Orbis has fragmented into states of feuding warlords. Like its predecessor, gameplay focuses on the RTS elements of resource and base management and unit combat but also the alignment system where all players start in similar positions and develop into their own unique faction of choice, the prime being under the strict religious knighthood of the Imperial, occultism and demon worship of the Pagan or the logic and scientific innovations of the Renaissance, all supporting both historical and fantasy based unit design.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Large scale battle at base walls.<br/><br/>Warrior Kings: Battle is a real-time strategy game meaning much of its gameplay is focused on gathering resources and training and management of units for combat against opposing players. There are three types of resources to harvest; food, materials and gold but are not available until they are dropped off at a village and then transported via cart to the main base or warehouse. The later two are gathered from the surrounding environments like forests and mines while food is grown and harvested from built farms with speed of growth depending on how fertile the land beneath it is.[2] A proportion of the food delivered by farmers is removed when they deliver to a village or drop off point representing your fighting units' consumption of food. The proportion removed is reliant on how many farms you have working compared to number of food consuming units. While villages and other resource-based buildings can be built anywhere other than within the base's walls, most military and economy based structures can only be built there, with each added building expanding the walls. There is also a mana bar present on some special units (this is notably absent from all renaissance units) with the ability to use magic. Additionally, some special structures such as the empire cathedral and pagan temple have mana bars that can be refilled through prayer or sacrifice of units depending on the alignment.<br/><br/>There are seven broad classes that units may be classified by, these are: Light (mostly ranged), Heavy (melee), Cavalry, Siege, reconnaissance (scouts), demonic, and special. Though some units might be classed as &quot;demonic&quot; or &quot;special&quot;, they all count as another type of unit as well. For example, a &quot;gibbering hoard&quot; is a daemon, but also counts as light infantry. All of these unit types are effective and vulnerable to the other classes such as demonic being weak to special and heavy cavalry being weak against heavy infantry head-on. These handicaps require use of terrain, unit formation, positioning, and modus of attack to be considered for units to overcome their inherent weakness'. Units are built at a base level but can be trained for better effectiveness both in battle through the use of attack dummies. Unlike most real time strategy games ranged units have a set amount of ammunition at their disposal that must be replenished by supply carts or certain buildings lest their rate of fire suffer. There are also naval units like attack ships and trade cogs built at a port by water yet can only be built and used in multiplayer games.<br/><br/>Along with the Campaign Mode, there are two modes for online multiplayer and offline single player. The first a basic Skirmish Mode where players fight in a standard game with set number of players and a chosen map and generals along with minor gameplay settings. The other is Valhalla Mode where instead of constructing bases and training armies, players pre-select a full army without any economic aspect of play with the goal being to captured strategic flags scattered throughout each map, requiring players to capture these to earn points with the highest point earner as the victor when the set amount of time finishes. Flags can be captured and recaptured multiple times along with respawning units as an option<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrior_Kings%3A_Battles Warrior Kings: Battles]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "214143": {"rpgartist": ["Algol", "Jacob Blackmon", "Dollar Photo Club", "Gary Dupuis", "Matthew Meyer", "Brett Neufeld", "Ryan Rhodes", "James Shields"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "The Talented Bard", "rpgdesigner": ["Mark Gedak"], "rpgproducer": ["Michael Matkin", "Owen K.C.

The forces of the two Soviet Fronts met each other near Zvenigorodka three days later. The Pocket that Soviets thus created, centered on the airfield at Korsun, encircled most of the units of two German Corps and was the largest encirclement the Soviets had achieved since the Battle of Stalingrad in November 1942.<br/><br/>Escape Hell&rsquo;s Gate covers the final attempt of the German 3rd Panzer Corps formations to reach those German units that were encircled within the Korsun Pocket between 10th and the 17th February 1944. Hell&rsquo;s Gate is a two-player game using the standard Fire and Movement rules and a set of exclusive rules that model the actual campaign. The game presents some unique challenges to both the German and Soviet player as the German relief forces attempt to break thru to the pocket, while the German forces within the pocket struggle to survive the Soviet onslaught. The Soviet player will be faced with moving his forces to block the relief attempt while making a final attempt to reduce the pocket.

RULES OF THE GAME MODE DUEL<br/>- Cards needed: the whole deck except JIKAN DESU, HANSOKU marks, IPPON marks<br/>- Number of players: 2-4<br/>- Duration: 4-5 min. with 2 players<br/><br/>Starting the game<br/>1. Before the start the following cards should be discarded from the deck: JIKAN DESU, HANSOKU marks, IPPON marks. The other cards should be divided into 3 subdecks:<br/>a. Basic attacks (Men, Kote, Do, Tsuki)<br/>b. Counterattacks<br/>c. All other cards<br/><br/>These subdecks should be shuffled and placed to the marks on the gameboard face-down.<br/><br/>2. Deal 3x basic attacks (Men, Kote, Do, Tsuki), 4x counterattacks and 5x from the other cards to each player.<br/>3. At the beginning, players can switch any 2 of their cards to other cards, each from its own subdeck. The new card should be drawn from the top of the subdeck and your switched card should be put under it. Switching a card is not compulsory.<br/>4. Add the numbers on your basic attack cards: the player with a higher result starts the first attack. If more players got the same total, switch the card with the lowest number on it to a new one from its own subdeck. Examine your totals again.<br/>5. You can start a new or first attack with the following cards and combinations:<br/>    - Men, Kote, Do, Tsuki attacks: a) alone or b) together with one reinforcing card (Jodan or Seme)<br/>    - Other attacking cards (Taiatari, Maki age). These two can only be played alone without reinforcing cards.<br/>6. An attack aiming a certain part of the body can always be countered with a same attacking card or an appropriate counterattack card. For example, a single MEN attack can be countered with the same MEN card, or a counterattack, which answers, so starts with MEN. A counterattack can also be answered with another appropriate counterattack or single attack card, and so on.<br/><br/>However, if you answer a counterattack with a basic attack card, your opponent can then start a new attack and does not need to answer your card.<br/><br/>7. If you are attacked with a single attack with a MEN, KOTE&hellip; etc. or a counterattack; OR a basic attack reinforced with a JODAN or SEME card, you must always react to it.<br/><br/>- If you are attacked with a basic attack with a reinforcing card, you must react to the reinforcing one first. You can try to neutralize it, deflect or reflect it. If you can&rsquo;t do any of these, your opponent pulls one card from you and can use it as one&rsquo;s own.<br/>- After reacting to a reinforcing card, you must react to the basic attack, too.<br/>- If you can&rsquo;t react to a MEN, KOTE, DO, TSUKI attack / counterattack, you lose two cards to your attacker.<br/>- If you are attacked with a TAIATARI or MAKI AGE card, and you have no valid card against it, you lose one card to your opponent, which he or she may choose without seeing your cards.<br/><br/>8. If you lose a card to another player:<br/>    - in case of 2-3 players: it&rsquo;s your turn to start a new attack against any of the other players;<br/>    - in case of 4 players: the player, who got your card can start a new attack, attacking anyone except you.<br/>9. If you cannot react to an incoming attack, and have no cards to give away or to start with when it&rsquo;s your turn, you lose the game. In case of 3-4 players playing, you drop out.<br/><br/>After you dropped out, your last attacker can draw one card from any of the subdecks as a bonus and can start a new attack.<br/>When 3 players are in the game, the player who did not receive a bonus card starts the next attack.<br/><br/>10. If it is your turn to start an attack, but you don&rsquo;t have any valid cards, you should discard one of your cards and draw a new one from the basic attacks subdeck and use that.<br/>11. In case of 2-3 players: if you can react to an attack with a valid card, you are free to choose whom you would like to attack with your used card.<br/><br/>In case of 4 players: you cannot attack your attacker with a single basic or counterattack, except when you use a card that deflects or reflects an attack directly.<br/><br/>Hikiwake (draw): when 2 players play, the game ends in a draw if the last applied valid card of any of the players is a TSUBAZERIAI or a BOGYO. When more than 2 players play, in this case this player simply drops out.<br/><br/><br/>II. RULES OF THE GAME VERSION &ndash; COMPETITION<br/>Cards needed: all the cards<br/>Number of players: only 2<br/>Duration: 10-20 mins<br/><br/>Aim of the game:<br/>The winner is the one who gets the second Ippon (point) first, or successfully plays the JIKAN DESU (Time&rsquo;s over!) card.<br/>It is considered as an IPPON (point) if a player cannot react to a basic or counterattack with a valid card OR has no more cards at all OR gets one&rsquo;s second Hansoku or penalty points.<br/>After an IPPON is awarded, all players draw as many new cards from any of the subdecks, that they have at least 6 cards in their hands. If you have more than 6, you can keep them but cannot draw more.<br/><br/>HANSOKU or penalty point must be given when:<br/>1. &lsquo;Stepping out of the court&rsquo;: you couldn&rsquo;t react to a TAIATARI card.<br/>2. &lsquo;Losing the sword&rsquo;: you couldn&rsquo;t react to a MAKI AGE card.<br/>The second hansoku you suffer means an IPPON to your opponent, and this is marked with a &bdquo;H&rdquo; as an ippon for hansoku.<br/>If it is your turn to start an attack but you have no valid card to do so, draw one card from the basic attacks subdeck and play that card.<br/>After an IPPON is awarded or a HANSOKU is given, always the &bdquo;unlucky&rdquo; player starts a new attack.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>Rule to switch cards: Always before you play a card, you must switch one of your cards to a new one from any of the sub-decks (without showing). Put your old card under its own subdeck.<br/><br/>AND you must draw a new card from the Counterattacks or the Other Cards sub-deck. You cannot draw this new one from the basic attacks subdeck.<br/><br/>Exception to the rule: if you play a BOGYO or a TSUBAZERIAI card, an IPPON is awarded or a HANSOKU is given, you are not allowed to switch and draw again one after another.

Two very different men, David Lance Arneson and Ernest Gary Gygax, undertook an unprecedented collaboration which gifted us &mdash; as their shared legacy &mdash; with one of the most intriguing games the world has yet experienced.  Their game did not just simulate one isolate corner of reality; it dared to encompass the entirety of all realms of adventure, the consensual playground of the human imagination.<br/><br/>HAWK &amp; MOOR tells the story of Dave and Gary, and the many other people whose efforts gave first life to the game we know and love today.  Arneson had spectacular ideas, but Gygax knew how to refine them.  Collaboration soon turned to conflict as Arneson believed his game was being taken from him, and Gygax crystallized systems where incomprehensible riddles had stood before.  Both men were creative geniuses, but the game they created from Gygax&rsquo;s Chainmail (1971) was the end result not only of their teamwork, but also of their clashes and disagreements.<br/><br/>HAWK &amp; MOOR Book Two:  The Dungeons Deep tells the tale of all that came after Blackmoor in the World of Greyhawk.

It consists of a metal spinning disk on top of a spinning arm with a white pointer and circle on one end and a red pointer on the other, all mounted in a yellow metal bowl.<br/><br/>The first game is a dog race. The spinning wheel is divided in six equal and color-coded segments with an illustration of a running dog in those colors. Each segment is divided into four unequal pieces marked with different payout odds (2-1, 4-1, 6-1 and 8-1). Players place bets on a separate betting mat divided into the six color boxes and spin the wheel. Where the pointer stops, that dog wins at the indicated odds and everyone else loses their bets. The player ending with the most money wins.<br/><br/>Outside the dog segments, however, the wheel is divided into 32 segments, each with a single letter. Each letter of the alphabet appears once, except for the five vowels (which get 2 spaces each) and a final square marked &quot;any letter&quot;. The rules for this game are not clear absent the instructions, but a box illustration says that &quot;Every correct word scores&quot;, suggesting that players perhaps must come up with as many words as possible starting with the letter spun, or including both letters on the opposite ends of the pointer.<br/><br/>"}, "214239": {"rpgdesigner": ["Keith J.

More than a century has passed since the last Acolytes moved freely among the planets negotiating contracts; Brethren members seized vulnerable outposts; Covenant scientists revealed the latest technologies; and Destined raiders captured vessels in their space lanes. But, all is not well.<br/><br/>Espionage agents working for the various Factions gathered significant intelligence on their current leaders' intentions. As the decades receded into history, the families, clans, and tribes of long-forgotten names, including Avalon, Augustus, du Lac, and Ravndotter have coalesced their efforts. One hundred years of isolation have taken their toll on the Factions. While each has exploited particular assets, the lack of connectivity with others has created its own set of complications.<br/><br/>The current generation of Terrans remains guarded and suspicious of others, but they are also filled with a desire to fulfil the providential future ordained by their leaders so many years ago. Scout ships and exploration vessels, commanded by pilots and astronavigators who have never ventured out beyond their own controlled space, have only begun making the arduous journey among the stars. Will these intrepid Faction members bury the sins of their forbearers, achieving a compromise among the others, or will they simply abandon all hope for a peaceful coexistence? Historians gazing out at the political landscape agree that after a long period of silence, the Tradewars shall begin.<br/><br/><br/>Tradewars: Homeworld  is a 1-4 player competitive space battle deck-building game, which utilizes three different scenarios to determine how the game is won:<br/><br/><br/>    Tradewars: Players must balance the collection of wealth with their need to defend their Homeworld.<br/>    Spacewars: This scenario is all about survival. Be the last player standing to win.<br/>    The Derelict: A single-player scenario that focuses on surviving an assault.<br/><br/><br/>During a player's turn, the player first selects any 1 of the 10 roles in the game, which are:<br/><br/><br/>    Chancellor: Can initiate a diplomatic vote to reach an agreement in the game<br/>    Treasurer: Discard cards for funds<br/>    Admiral: Control multiple starships<br/>    Captain: Reconfigure starships<br/>    Commander: Reconfigure crews<br/>    Engineer: Reconfigure weapons<br/>    Sergeant: Force all opponents to discard<br/>    Private: Force 1 opponent to discard<br/>    Smuggler: Steal 1 card from 3 chosen cards.<br/>    Trader: Draw extra cards<br/><br/><br/>The scenarios determine which of the 10 roles are more desirable during the game, though each role has its purpose. Players must determine what actions and benefits they need in order to move their agenda forward. Once the role is resolved, the player may trade cards to buy Upgrade cards.<br/><br/><br/>Cards may also be sold to increase the player's Treasury value.<br/><br/><br/>Adjustments are made on the Score Pad whenever necessary and in accordance to card effects or player actions. Wealth, Homeworld Defense Points, and the number of starships the player can build are kept track of on the mat.<br/><br/><br/>When a player acquires starships, they may deploy them to the &quot;Space Lane&quot;, which act as walls to protect their Homeworld from invasion. Before a starship can be deployed, it must be configured, which entails connecting 3 Upgrade cards; the starship Upgrade card, crew Upgrade card, and weapons upgrade card. Configuration of a starship means that it is manned, armed and ready to fly. Each Upgrade card has an Energy rating (or &quot;capacity&quot;), Weapon rating (or &quot;firepower&quot;), and Crew rating (or &quot;resistance&quot;).<br/><br/>A player may command up to 4 starships at a time, from an array of 5 unique classes. Starships can be configured in up to 125 different combinations.<br/><br/><br/>Combat is initiated when the player decides to use their starships to attack an opponent&rsquo;s starships or an opponent&rsquo;s unprotected homeworld. Attacking is only possible if the player elects to take the Admiral role for their turn.<br/><br/>Attacks can be done with 1 or more starships and the attacker gets to decide which of the opponent&rsquo;s ships are included in the skirmish.<br/><br/>Initiative is determined by rolling dice. If the attacking player wins the initiative, the battle continues. If not, the opponent is able to escape the fight.<br/><br/><br/>A player's turn ends when the player is done taking all their actions, at which point they may draw back up to 5 cards. If their draw deck is exhausted, the discard pile is shuffled and becomes the new draw deck.<br/><br/>The players continue to take turns until the game is won. The victory condition is determined by the scenario selected by the players. Once the objective has been met, the game is over and the winner is announced.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Second edition"], "average": "9.33333", "name": "Tradewars: Homeworld \u2013 Exterra Edition", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Deck / Pool Building", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Trading"], "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": ["221542", "221541"], "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "XTG3"]}, "214247": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Hidden Shrine of Xarak", "rpgdesigner": ["Marc Palombo"], "rpgproducer": ["Shauna Wolf Narciso"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3271464.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Forgotten Realms"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3271464_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>Raiding bullywugs in the region kidnapped some of the local farmers&rsquo; children and took them into the Marsh Wood.

His accession to power is decided in the gigantic battle of Sekigahara. He will force the heir to Hideyoshi to commit suicide at the end of the siege of Osaka.

When a player gathers five kittens, he or she will turn into the crazy cat person. The crazy cat person will receive no benefits from his or her job card resulting in victory being unachievable. Instead this player will now have the ability to throw cats at normal people, taking revenge from the players that led to his or her state.<br/><br/>The winner is the one able to keep him or herself mentally sane.<br/><br/>"}, "214311": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3371588.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Matt Hyra", "Alex Lim"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2017", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "0", "boardgamepublisher": ["Cryptozoic Entertainment", "Weta Workshop"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3371588_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game"], "description": "Promotional card offered by &quot;Man vs Meeple Season One Kickstarter&quot;.<br/><br/>Opposing player cannot tag this round.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "GKR: Heavy Hitters \u2013 Raw Talk", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Deck / Pool Building"], "average": "9", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Promotional Cards"]}, "214312": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3519438.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Joseph Propati"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Joseph Propati"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3519438_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Card Game", "Children's Game", "Deduction", "Dice", "Print & Play"], "description": "You compete against your opponent to climb to the top of the wall before your opponent.

You know RPGs have something to do with nerds sitting around a table pretending to be elves and rolling funny dice, but the details are a little fuzzy. Even if you&rsquo;re an experienced RPG player, most game manuals spend more time explaining rules and genre trappings than offering practical advice for first-time Game Masters. Whether you&rsquo;re a wannabe gamer who&rsquo;s never rolled a twenty-sided die or a long-time player who&rsquo;s decided to take the plunge and run your own game for the first time, So You&rsquo;ve Decided To Run a Role-Playing Game teaches you how to go from thinking about running a role-playing game to actually doing it. So You&rsquo;ve Decided To Run A Role-Playing Game starts by describing what actually goes on during a role-playing game, then provides step-by-step advice for organizing and running your own RPG campaign, from finding a gaming group to plotting your ongoing story. So You&rsquo;ve Decided To Run A Role-Playing Game is geared toward first-time Game Masters, but contains lots of practical advice and helpful tips that even veteran Game Masters are likely to find helpful.<br/><br/>"}, "214341": {"rpgdesigner": ["Sheba Blake"], "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Role Playing Games", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["Sheba Blake"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3272061.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgpublisher": ["CreateSpace"], "rpgcategory": ["Non-Game Book (but RPG Related)"], "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3272061_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>Role Playing Games covers Role Playing Game Basics, Choose Your Game, Hooking Up With Like Minded Players, What about the Game Master, Choose Characters and Options, Know the Rules, Make Sure To Have Fun, Getting In the Player Mindset, The Best Role Playing Games and Learning To Separate These Games from Reality.

Hubris is a land of terrible creatures, grand inequality, strange and cruel gods, dangerous magic, opulent nobility, destitute commoners, people that have become corrupted and turned to savage beasts, constant wars, and worse.<br/><br/>The kingdoms are not kind or benevolent: In the Blighted Sands the Klind are slavers and openly practice sorcery, offering sacrifices to their depraved serpentine god, Set. Across the continent the Fairweather kingdom is governed by a corrupt and inbred royal family with the nobility following suit. Esenbar is ruled by a staunch xenophobic theocracy that tolerates little outside of their strict doctrine. The barbaric Ingvar of the Frozen Wastes wage vicious battles against the savage frost giants of The Crag, and care little about the goings on of the world; their life is cut from battle with an axe or sword. The Black Queen rules the citizens of the Floating Island of Terror from her throne of bones and dreams terrible machinations for Hubris. Shadowfall, built in the remains of the burrow of a gigantic worm, is ran by vampires and their thralls, and they welcome all who are devious, vicious and cunning.<br/><br/>There are no easily recognizable heroes in the world. You wander the wilderness or delve into ancient ruins: out of desperation, some crazed need for adventure, or for some bizarre belief that the world can actually be made a better place. Though civilization offers you security and comfort, you shirk those in the hopes of gaining riches and power. But when you die, no one will sing songs of your deeds. You will die a horribly bloody death at the hands of some twisted abomination or by the knife of an assassin sent by some fat, scheming noble.<br/><br/>Your epic tale will be forgotten in days as the dangerous world continues on without you and the apathetic masses stay complacent to dogmatic control of their government.<br/><br/>This is not a fairy tale or an epic ballad.

It can be played alone or combined with the play of the two-map scenario in the parent game. Either way, it will provide a complete theater-commander experience.<br/><br/>The system is based around the central idea that large First World armies (as well as those from elsewhere that have been trained and equipped to try to perform like First World armies) almost always begin major wars seemingly well prepared. Unfortunately for those in their front-line units, both the training and equipment usually only make them ready for the previous war, not the one they're about to fight. Beyond that, the initial period of such wars is characterized by only a partially abandoned peacetime psychology among the officers and enlisted. That is, no one as yet appreciates what it means operatively to be in an all-out war. All that comes together to give overall performance high-risk, volatile and fragile qualities: no one as yet really knows what's actually possible or wise to try to accomplish.

But sometimes, it can be fun to take on the mantle of the otherworldly, and to embrace the alien terrors of the cosmos. Each installment of Weekly Wonders: Eldritch Archetypes contains five archetypes for eldritch characters&mdash;those that are weird, alien, and otherworldly, who don&rsquo;t fit in with normal society&mdash;as well as a cleric domain devoted to a specific mythos entity or race.<br/><br/>For this book, we focus on Bokrug, the patron deity of the beings of Ib, who wreaked terrible vengeance upon the men of Sarnath. A great water lizard and one of the terrible Great Old Ones, Bokrug features most prominently in H.P. Lovecraft&rsquo;s The Doom That Came to Sarnath. Whether they mention Ib or Bokrug directly or not, each archetype in this book builds on themes of amphibious creatures and patient, overwhelming vengeance against those who have wronged you. This book contains the following archetypes:<br/><br/>    The judge of Sarnath, an inquisitor archetype that focuses on turning enemies&rsquo; attacks against them, and delivers powerful punishment against the enemies of Bokrug.<br/>    The avenger of Ib, a paladin archetype that can smite any creature who commits a terrible crime before her, and which radiates powerful retributive auras.<br/>    The Bokrug spirit, a shaman spirit with many abilities thematically relating to doom, vengeance, and watery depths.<br/>    The blade of Bokrug, a slayer archetype that focuses on slow and patient combat to eventually deliver overwhelming and devastating attacks on his foes.<br/>    The keeper of memory, a spiritualist archetype whose phantom is one of the long-dead beings of Ib, which whispers ancient secrets of Bokrug to her, and gives her the power to control plants and water.<br/>    A bonus cleric domain devoted to those who worship Great Old One Bokrug.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "214361": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Modern Monks"], "statistics": [], "name": "Modern Monks Skill and Tech Index", "rpgdesigner": ["Al Seeger"], "rpgproducer": ["Al Seeger"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3272815.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Martial Arts", "Modern"], "rpgpublisher": ["Point of Insanity Game Studio"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3272815_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The Modern Monks Skill and Tech Index is a list of all current abilities for the Modern Monks Role Playing Game.
