Box measures 20&quot; x 11 1/4&quot;.  Single-fold mounted color game board with 21 x 19 one-inch-square grid superimposed to regulate movement.  Terrain represented includes Mountain, Forest, Plains, Fords, and Rivers.  Multi-square Airfields also represented.<br/><br/>Miniature plastic pieces include Tanks, APCs and Airplanes (six Tanks, six APCs and three Airplanes per side; complete set of each in Yellow, Brown, Green, and Blue).  The APCs are eight-wheeled turreted vehicles strongly resembling a USMC LAV.  Tanks resemble a cross between the US Army M-109 SP gun and an Israeli Merkava tank.  Airplanes slightly resemble early speculative depictions of a Stealth fighter with twin tails and an unflattering forward-swept projection on the leading wing edge.<br/>  <br/>All of these units are moved according to the roll of two six-sided dice.  Die results are added together; the sum (&quot;dice units&quot;) is allocated among friendly pieces for movement.<br/><br/>Terrain costs vary for Tank and APC units.  Pieces may be moved in any direction including diagonally, but may not stack together or pass through an occupied space.<br/><br/>All unit types have a &quot;range&quot; of two spaces.  Tanks may not attack Airplanes (unless all friendly Airplanes are destroyed).  Airplanes must be &quot;airborne&quot; in order to attack (they must &quot;take off&quot; down the &quot;runway&quot; of their &quot;airstrip&quot;).<br/><br/>Combat is resolved by die roll, &quot;attacker&quot; and targeted &quot;defender&quot; each rolling one die.  The result of subtracting low roll from high roll is referenced to a &quot;Battle Chart&quot; yielding a result of &quot;Safe,&quot; &quot;Disabled&quot; or &quot;Destroyed.&quot;  APCs are destroyed on a difference of &quot;1&quot; or more.  Tanks are &quot;disabled&quot; by a difference of &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot; and &quot;destroyed&quot; by a differential of &quot;3&quot; or more.  Airplanes are &quot;destroyed&quot; by a differential of &quot;3&quot; or more vs. another Airplane or an APC or a &quot;4&quot; or &quot;5&quot; if beaten by a tank. Airplanes are &quot;disabled&quot; by a &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot; differential vs. another Airplane or an APC.<br/><br/>Destroyed units are removed.  Disabled tanks are turned on their side.  &quot;Disabled&quot; tanks may be &quot;captured.&quot;  A friendly or enemy APC may &quot;capture&quot; a &quot;disabled&quot; tank by moving adjacent and surviving until the next friendly turn.  At the start of the next friendly turn, the tank is turned rightside-up and is considered friendly to the capturing player.<br/><br/>Disabled Airplanes &quot;crash land.&quot;  The &quot;disabled&quot; Airplane travels three spaces in a straight line (in any direction the owning player chooses) and is turned upside-down.  During this &quot;descent&quot; the Airplane may &quot;pass over&quot; other units, but the space it &quot;crashes&quot; in must be vacant.  An APC (friendly or hostile) may &quot;recover&quot; the downed Airplane in the same manner as a Tank is recovered; however, when the Airplane is turned rightside-up, it is immediately returned to a friendly Airbase parking space.<br/><br/>&quot;Disabled&quot; pieces may be attacked and destroyed instead of being captured if a player so chooses.<br/><br/>A unit may only inflict damage on the first unit to attack it in a given turn.  If a piece survives an initial attack and is attacked again, it rolls in defense as usual, but will not inflict any damage on its attacker even if its die roll is higher.<br/><br/>Airbases may be captured by disabling or destroying all hostile pieces on the Airbase and then occupying at least one square of the Airbase with a friendly Tank or APC.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to be the last player with a surviving APC unit.<br/><br/>Rules include options for a short game with less equipment.  A small paper insert, dated 1991, provided a simpler version using the same movement rules but capturing by simply moving a piece onto an opposing piece space, moving and capturing until all &quot;dice units&quot; have been used.<br/><br/>The box art painting accurately portrays the pieces inside.  One of the modernistic tanks advances firing, evading a near miss while the moon lights APCs crossing a stream to the rear in Ardennes-type terrain as jets swoop above.  The title &quot;Battle Command&quot; appears in large red letters all the way across the top of this illustration.  In smaller white letters across the bottom: &quot;A Fast-Playing Game of Strategy, Daring, and Chance!&quot;<br/><br/>In the lower right corner is the logo of &quot;Precision Toy,&quot; white letters superimposed over a line of evergreens with the title and evergreens &quot;reflected&quot; oppositely beneath.  The back cover features a large black-and-white photo of the board and components.  &quot;Precision Toy&quot; was located in Julian, CA 92036.  The game was made in USA.<br/><br/>"}, "17002": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic250591.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1973", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "6", "boardgamepublisher": ["Milton Bradley"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic250591_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "description": "Based on the Houndcats animated series, this is a typical early 70's spin the dial and move game.

Marcus says, &ldquo;When I was knocking back a home-made rocket fuel in a remote Asian village one day I realized what a fascinating yet surreal world I was traveling in. I had read books that touched on some of the real issues of backpacking but nothing came close to telling me the full story. I decided to find another way to teach people what they were in for.

They had made two determined assaults on &lsquo;Hill Peter&rsquo;, to no avail. After reorganizing during the night, the 9th Marines were ready for another push to the top of the hill. At 1250 hrs., their break came. Following a ten minute preparation by division and corps artillery, both battalions struck out in a coordinated attack. With the 1st Battalion on the right and the 2nd on the left, the Marines began their move up the slopes of Hill Peter. The 1st Battalion overran the hill and continued on down the reverse slope and up to the crest of &lsquo;Hill Oboe&rsquo; to the northwest. The 1st Battalion&rsquo;s &lsquo;A&rsquo; Company did not enjoy the same momentum on their way to Oboe. &lsquo;A&rsquo; Company was stopped by a small enemy AA detachment with supporting fire from emplaced machine-guns in a small draw on their right flank. &lsquo;A&rsquo; Company rapidly deployed to meet this threat.<br/><br/>ATS SEMPER FI! (aka Uncommon Valor Upgrade Edition) is the new COMPLETE GAME that depicts the battle for Iwo Jima. Three years into the Pacific war the United States Marine Corps had mastered the art of the amphibious landing. The landing force at Iwo still had much to learn about the enemy. Senior intelligence officers did not know until 27 February that General Kuribayashi was in fact personally running the show from his headquarters on Iwo Jima. As the Marines regrouped after their landing, it was obvious that something was different on Iwo Jima. No dense jungles, just ash from the island&rsquo;s volcano, Suribachi. Steam could be seen rising from the natural sulfur water wells which bubbled to the surface all over the island. Worse, the dug-in defenders actually numbered half again the original estimate of 13,000. Kuribayshi was particularly pleased with the quality of his artillery and engineering troops. The Japanese defenders waiting for the advance of the V Amphibious Corps were well armed and confident.

At 1350 hours the company commander, Captain George R. J. Weigand, was ordered to move up between the two ridges, then turn left, using Fox Ridge as cover. The goal of the onslaught was Ryan&rsquo;s Ridge, or alternately the road cut west of Gusukuma. It was still assumed at that point that contact could be established with 1st Battalion. Weigand completed passing through Ryan&rsquo;s left flank and attacked east toward the crest of Ryan&rsquo;s Ridge, heading toward what the Company Commander thought would be a covered route to the top of the ridge. Weigand attacked in platoons, moving to the point with 3rd Platoon, under command of Technical Sergeant Ernest L. Shoeff. This platoon would find itself attacking alone, after a storm of enemy machine-gun and mortar fire forced the rest of the company to ground. Weigand, Shoeff, and two squads kept moving forward, using tombs at the foot of the hill for cover. Orders were communicated to Weigand by a runner: extend the line at all costs. The Captain and two men soon found themselves cut off from Shoeff and the remainder of the main body. For the rest of the afternoon the company commander was under constant fire and out of communications with everyone. After dark Weigand managed to make his way back to Fox Ridge and rejoin his company. His uniform was shot full of holes but Weigand returned uninjured.<br/><br/>ATS BLOOD &amp; IRON is the new COMPLETE GAME that depicts the battle for Okinawa. The center of the Japanese resistance in the area lay in the &ldquo;I&rdquo; section of Target Area 7777, which came to be called &ldquo;Item Pocket&rdquo;&mdash;in military terminology I is called Item. The pocket was the hub of the enemy position; from it, like spokes on a giant wheel, extended four low ridges, separated from each other by ravines and rice paddies. Potter&rsquo;s Ridge ran north from the hub, Charlie Ridge to the northeast, Gusukuma Ridge to the southeast, and Ryan Ridge to the southwest. Lying between Gusukuma and Charlie Ridges and sloping to the east was a cone-shaped hill called by the Americans &ldquo;Brewer&rsquo;s Hill.&rdquo; A gulch ran along each side of the hill&mdash;Anderson&rsquo;s Gulch on the north and Dead Horse Gulch on the south. Both ran in an easterly direction, crossing Route 1 at small bridges just north of Gusukuma. The ground was superbly suited for active defense. Typical Japanese positions were connected by tunnels along the sides and under the crests of the ridges; Ryan Ridge, in particular, was honeycombed with such defenses. From Item Pocket the enemy had excellent command both of the coastal areas to the north and west and the open land to the east where Route 1 ran north-south. The Japanese had long been aware of the defensive value of this position against either a beach landing on the northwest or an attack from the north. Months before the Americans landed, Japanese troops and Okinawan laborers were boring tunnels and establishing elaborate living quarters and aid stations. The area was held by two companies of the 21st Independent Infantry Battalion of the 64th Brigade, 62nd Division, supported by an antitank company, a machine gun company, and elements of antiaircraft, artillery, and mortar units. At least 600 Japanese occupied the Pocket, reinforced by several hundred Okinawans. <br/>&middot; A collection of 517 color, die-cut counters representing the US Army and Japanese combatants that fought in the battle; <br/>&middot; SIX scenarios, ranging in size from small to large, that play on the historical map; <br/>&middot; A 22 x 34 color map of the ITEM POCKET battlefield on heavyweight stock; <br/>&middot; A complete ATS system rulebook tailored specifically to the game; <br/>&middot; Six Play Aid Cards; <br/>&middot; Battlefield Walkaround and Special Rules document (an ATS specialty!) <br/>&middot; A color cover (perfect for your rules binder) and a snazzy ziplock bag to hold it all.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "ATS Blood & Iron", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "7.4375", "usersrated": "16", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Advanced Tobruk System"]}, "17155": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "7", "poll": [], "name": "The Dartmoor Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1985", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic73631_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["ED-U-Cards Mfg"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic73631.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Exploration", "Travel"], "age": "9", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "&quot;The Dartmoor game&quot; was designed in collaboration with Dartmoor National Park Authority to help improve geographical knowledge of visitors to this National Park in the county of Devon in the UK.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to travel across Dartmoor landing on specific grid references, collect a &quot;certificate&quot; and then return to your home town.<br/><br/>Movement and points accumulation is through use of dice and answering questions along the way.<br/><br/>Two versions of the game can be played.

Each chip has 0 to 6 clout points. Players have to make a stack 15 chips, while not spending more than a set amount of Clout on the stack. Players take turns throwing the chips into the play area, and depending on how they hit the table, the individual effects of each chip occur. Chips have stats, abilities, and powers that affect game play. Some of the powers and abilities include protection, poison, weaken, and the strengthening of other chips within a radius of where the chip lands. After the chips land on the table, players can decide to attack other player's chips. Further chip effects can come into play in these situations. For example, chips with the Taunt ability force attacking chips to attack them before any other chips. Chips are eliminated from the play area as play continues. After throwing and playing out all their chips, players count all their Clout still in the play area plus extra points for proximity to other chips. Whoever has the most Clout points wins.<br/><br/>Some chips are common, while others are unique, adding to the collectability factor. In addition, there are various &quot;types&quot; of chips including effects, characters, and bases, to name just a few. Where chips land on the table and how players throw will have a significant effect on how the game will play out. The chips are approximately the same weight and style as casino poker chips, not cardboard.

Collect, win, lose or buy LOVE, MONEY, PEOPLE and Question cards in this fun and exciting game where all players win a real personalized fortune card reading of their own.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Each player rolls the die, moves his or her pawn, and then does what the landed on square tells them to.  This is almost always either gaining or losing fortune telling cards (from four different decks - love, money, people, and questions) or empowering stones (which can be traded in for fortune telling cards).  The rules state that the &quot;object is for each player to collect as many fortune telling cards as possible&quot;; but they also state that the winner &quot;is the player who draws the last card,&quot; which ends the game and allows that player to discard up to three of their cards.<br/><br/>The real purpose is for each player to use the cards collected during the game to have their personal fortune told on the tarot-style card layout board.<br/><br/>If you believe in this stuff, you'll be happy to know that &quot;all Jennifer Sands products are created with the assistance of professional psychics, fortune tellers and astrologers.

Pieces of the same colour start in a row at opposite ends of the board and players take turns to move a piece of their colour one square at a time orthogonally. A piece may also jump over one other piece as a move. The central square on the board is occupied by a four-leaf clover and pieces may not enter this square nor jump over it. A player wins when he or she makes a move that completes a square (I interpret this to be a 2-by-2 square) containing 2 red and 2 yellow pieces (the two colours may be side-by-side or crossing diagonally).<br/><br/>"}, "17207": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Ron Toelke"], "poll": [], "name": "Catchpenny", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1996", "usersrated": "15", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic74415_t.jpg", "average": "5.3", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Chatham Hill Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic74415.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Chatham Hill Games Gray edition w/ Games 100 mark"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "Use the money of old England to buy, sell and trade with each other.  &quot;Buy My Wares?&quot; cards make every sale a different one.<br/><br/>Build the largest mon-o-polies of street pedlars and tradespeople.

The number following each action indicates the chances out of six that the attempted action will be successful. Recruit allows you to draw a chit from the pool into your hand, while Deploy allows you to place a unit from your hand into play.

It was easy all we had to do was make it simple and quick to play, whilst still blending in a level of complexity that would keep the players interest alive. Well, I am sure that we have succeeded in doing just that. Using a mixture of Metal Miniatures, Resin Buildings and Cards and Counters, there is very little note taking and working out involved as the counters and cards remove this aspect, and the player is free to work on the most important aspect of the game strategy, and this is what the game is really about!<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game all the players start with the same amount of pieces and the basic idea of the game is to grow your settlement faster than the other players, buying Figures and Buildings with game tokens as you go along, hopefully avoiding Natural Disasters and other unforeseen incidents.The game can be played by 2 or 4 players and is for Ages 14 and up and is fun for families as well as boardgamers &amp; wargamers.<br/><br/>A great deal of time and effort was put into the design of the game pieces, which are very detailed. The same figures are used for each different tribe, which are just painted differently. Spears &amp; Shields are cast separately, but come with the figures that they are intended for. The rules are well printed complete with a color cover, and are packed with black &amp; white illustrations. The game tokens are printed in color, on white card.<br/><br/>To sum up, this was daunting but great fum to create, and to play-test, of which there were many games. There isn't a game like it on the market that I know of, and I know that those who buy a set are going to find it an appealing and tactical game.

The cards are divided into 4 suits, each suit representing a trade: Mechanic, Bricklayer, Farmer or Carpenter. The cards within each suit do not have ranks and display tools or supplies that trade would use. For example, the Farmer cards include seed, a tractor and a scythe. Some cards belong to more than one suit (e.g. the bucket belongs to both the Bricklayer and Farmer suits). In addition, there is a fifth suit, labeled with a 'T'. These cards bear generic goodies like money, Industry, a first aid box and a 'Good Luck' card.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player receives a card specifying his trade for that hand. The object is to collect as many cards as you can that belong to your trade. At each turn, you pick one card from the previous player's unused cards. If it belongs to your suit, you add it to your sequence. Otherwise, it joins your unused cards which you then offer to the next player, who will pick a card, and so on. 'T' cards are wild cards that you can add to your sequence. There are three 'T' cards with a '?' on them and the words 'dillo tu' (name me). You can only add these cards to your sequence if you can name a tool/object that fits with your trade and is not already used in the game. The 'Good Luck' card has the power of negating an unused card in your hand - if you have the 'Good Luck' card and only one unused card, you can end the game immediately.<br/><br/>The game ends when any player runs out of unused cards.

This game covers all the action of the period using a unique card-driven game system that models both the political and religious conflicts of the period on a single point-to-point map.<br/><br/>There are six main powers in the game, each with a unique path to victory:<br/><br/>    The Ottomans<br/>    The Habsburgs<br/>    The English<br/>    The Valois Dynasty of France<br/>    The Papacy<br/>    The Protestants<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Here I Stand is the first card-driven game to prominently feature secret deal-making.

And that&acute;s a pity, because all the ingredient's of a great game are there.<br/><br/>Die Tour is a card driven game and all players have 15 cards (1 card = 1 turn) at the start, which they have to work with, until only 2 are left and the hand is filled up again to 15 cards. On these cards are four numbers (= number of fields, the drivers are allowed to move), one for each of the drivers, every team has at the beginning and sometimes special moves for special situations. Each number has to be attached to one of your drivers and the decision how to divide them, is yours.<br/><br/>Rules for group splitting, mountain races, single driver time races and slipstreaming are included in the basic game, but there exists an (even more rare !) advanced rules set, which the authors played with their gaming buddies. Besides various modifications to the basic version, this advanced rules set includes additional rules for group slowing, card exchanges, team time races and more.<br/><br/>Die Tour allows single races (about 60 minutes playing time and there are flat, mountain and time race stages) or an entire campaign game, which is a series of connected stages. Since there are various roads to victory (champion, best mountain driver, highest points and best team), the campaign game is of course the most interesting way, to play Die Tour, because it reduces the effects of luck. But the kings way, to play Die Tour, is to race a campaign game over many gaming nights and to give little prices to the winners in the different categories every evening and bigger prices for the final winners.<br/><br/>An extremely hard to find game, but if you see it somewhere (best chance probably : On flee markets in Berlin-Germany, because the authors are from there), grab it immediately, because you will not regret it !<br/><br/>"}, "17454": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Market", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Commodity Speculation", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "1930", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1393835_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["KUM-BAK Sports, Toys, & Games, MFG Co.

[...]<br/><br/>There are two different scales used in Space Marines, in effect, there are two different games here. The basic game uses a time scale of twenty seconds per turn and a normal ground scale of one inch equaling twenty-five meters. In the 'skirmish' rules the time scale is ten seconds per turn and a ground scale of one inch equaling 12.5 meters. The basic scale assumes that the players will have a significant number of figures on the table, possibly ten to twenty per player. The skirmish rules are intended for very small numbers of figures per player, no more than two or three under normal circumstances. The skirmish rules are almost entering into role-playing, although they do not constitute a full role playing system, just a combat system.
