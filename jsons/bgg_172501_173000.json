Players could accept Lifechained feats to enter this ecosystem, gaining incredible powers, at the cost of heightened vulnerability to an assortment of truly terrifying monsters.<br/><br/>Horrors of the Lifechain focuses on the Lifechain as a source of endless new threats for heroes to battle. It collects the revised Lifespawn originally presented in Dark Star Bestiary I &amp; II, and returns them to their natural habitat: deep space of the Otherverse America campaign setting. It also pulls in a few beings from the well-received Space Monsters series of mini-bestiaries: the revamped Chyss work great as Nemesis-bloodline Lifespawn conquerors, and make Phallus Space that much more dangerous.

Recruit fearless Heroes and discover powerful Artifacts as you amass your forces. Will you master arcane magic or win through the strength of steel? Champions can even join together to take on greater threats as they vie for the most Glory.<br/><br/>Players start the game with two Lands under their control. Each turn, the controlling Champion (the player whose turn it is) rolls a ten-sided die for Production. The result of the role is compared to their Lands and Resources are acquired by all players accordingly. The controlling Champion can then use acquired Resources to expand to new Lands (thereby increasing their Resource production), recruit Heroes (cards) to increase their Magic and/or Combat power, improve their land with Tower Upgrades that add to the Production roll's result, or purchase Artifacts (cards) that give Glory and additional passive or active benefits. Additionally, players may undertake secret Quests that provide Glory, primarily, at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The main source of Glory, however, is Battle. The controlling Champion will end his or her turn with the option of sending forces into Battle, challenging their choice of Rank 1-5. In Battle, Champions must choose whether they will fight with the strength of Combat or the power of Magic. The chosen Battle Rank card is turned over and the controlling Champion faces the challenge by rolling a ten-sided die and adding their chosen power. If the result exceeds the target, they win and receive both Glory and Reward (in the form of Resources). If they lose, Glory is lost.<br/><br/>Additionally, the controlling Champion may solicit aid from another player before the Battle begins. Players can combine their powers to take on greater threats (and earn greater Glory) than they could on their own.<br/><br/>End game is triggered when a player reaches 144 Glory (tracked around the edge of the game board).

Out of fuel, you set down in a crater and view the airless landscape before you.

If either of these levels drops below 1 during a systems check, you have lost the game.<br/><br/>Needed to Play!<br/>The deck of Map Cards (30 cards)<br/>The deck of Event and Equipment Cards (21 cards)<br/>1 Suit Card showing your remaining oxygen and battery power + 2 Tracking Cards which also include the Quick Rules Guide<br/>1 Astronaut, 1 Spaceship, and 3 Fuel Tank counters<br/><br/>Setting the Game Up!<br/>Shuffle the Map deck and deal the cards out face down in a 6 x 5 grid, there will be 5 rows of cards, each row will have 6 cards in it.<br/><br/>Find the card on the grid with the Spaceship icon on it and turn this card over to the other side, placing your Spaceship and Astronaut on it.<br/><br/>Playing the Game!<br/>Each turn of the game will consist of 3 phases:<br/><br/>Phase 1. Movement<br/>At the beginning of your turn you must move your Astronaut, from the card it is currently on, any number of cards in an orthogonal direction (this means up or down, left or right). The first two cards in distance you move you may do so for free. For each additional card you move during the turn you must lose either 1 level of your Oxygen or 1 level of your Battery Power. Move the Tracking Cards down the Oxygen or Battery tracks as needed to record this. You may change directions as you move (i.e. 1 card to the left and then one card up). You may never move diagonally.<br/><br/>You are trying to find, using your spacesuit&rsquo;s equipment, a series of numbered beacons (in pairs) which will locate where the 3 Fuel Tanks are stored. These beacons give you a set of coordinates (one beacon points up and down, the other points left and right). You will need to locate the pair of matching numbered beacons and then move to the card the beacons point to. In the example to the right, X marks the spot where one of the Fuel Tanks is located.<br/><br/>Phase 2. Events and Equipment<br/>After you have finished moving you must now draw 3 cards from the Events and Equipment deck. This deck has two types of cards.<br/>If this deck is empty when you go to draw a card, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck to draw cards from.<br/><br/>A. Event Cards - these cause you to lose Oxygen or Battery Power due to your exploration.<br/>B. Equipment Cards - these cause you to gain resources you need (Oxygen and Battery Power), as well as give you special actions to help in your exploration.<br/><br/>Keep the Equipment cards in your hand from one turn to the next. You will need a pair of the same cards to gain the listed bonus. You may have no more than three Equipment cards in your hand at the end of the Events and Equipment phase.<br/><br/>Phase 3. Systems Check<br/>You must now check your Suit Systems. If either your Oxygen or Battery Power level is below 1 you have lost the game. Do not forget that you may spend a pair of matching cards at anytime during the System Check phase (Phase 3) to gain the listed bonus, by placing the cards on the discard pile.<br/><br/>"}, "172559": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Wilfried Fort"], "average": "5.87455", "poll": [], "name": "Targets", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "55", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3372683_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Brian Kolodziejski", "Tony Rochon"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Blackrock Games", "SimplyFun", "Zoch Verlag"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3372683.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English-only first edition", "English/German first edition", "Multilingual first edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Dice"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "In Targets, players don't roll their dice, but flick them from the top of a tower to try to land them on targets placed in the playing area.

While all three sticks can be placed horizontally or vertically, red stick can also be placed diagonally.<br/><br/>Each player places two sticks in their turn, with each stick's tip touching the tip of at least one other stick on the board.

Points in blue circles, if the shape surrounds any such circles on the board.<br/><br/>Once all six sticks are used, a player may collect six more by picking a reload card. Additionally, five power cards are distributed to each player at the beginning of the game. These cards provide special powers to the players that can improve their position in the game or slow down the progress of other players.

It explores a pensive man's descent from a mountain from the moment he reaches the peak. You navigate the mountain while exploring the man's thoughts as he contemplates about the unknown abyss that lies exactly after his life's biggest accomplishment.<br/><br/>There are five exit points on the board, one for every element that will affect your journey - frost, sun, wind, sky and horizon. As you try and find the path down, you learn more about yourself through the story cards, divided into five different story lines that affect you as a protagonist.<br/><br/>However, the path down is not immediately obvious. Your movement subdues and stimulates the elements. If three or four elements are acting, you start suffering from ennui; a feeling that perhaps getting to the bottom of the mountain is not that important after all. If all five elements are raging, you will succumb to nature and die.<br/><br/>Traverse through the safest path and take care of yourself.

When everyone has chosen their character cards, the first player announces the characters one by one.

The lizardfolk of the swamps are no different in this regard, and their strange magic, which is a mix of primitive naturalistic mysticism, and dark unspeakable ritual, provides a number of potent spells for those who have a chance to learn them. While such secrets are rarely shared with outsiders, and the lizardfolk who use them almost never write them down, a number of these lost spells of the swamp have been collected in this tome.<br/><br/>This book contains 11 new spells for the druid, sorcerer/wizard, and witch spell lists, all of which are thematically linked to lizardfolk and their swampy homes. The black rain spell allows you to bring misery and misfortune to a large stretch of land by cursing it with foul, black rain, while the mud serpent spell conjures a snake made of living earth to rise up and attack your foes.

You may create any baseball universe you like, for example with the real league setup, a historic leagues, or totally fictional leagues. The number of leagues within your virtual baseball universe is not limited so you may have as many leagues and minor leagues as you like.<br/>Managing your baseball franchise takes a lot of knowledge and skills but OOTPB 2006 offers you all the tools you will need to succeed. You can set up your roster, lineups, depth charts and your pitching staff. Sign new players, demote them to the minors or release fading veterans. Initiate trades, respond to trade offers and make the right decisions in the first-year player drafts. In a word, anything a real GM does can be done in OOTPBM 2006. You have the power to guide your team into the infinite future. But beware; you might get fired if your calls result in your team finishing under .500 all the time.<br/><br/>- A realistic and accurate simulation engine<br/>Using a highly realistic and accurate baseball simulation engine, OOTPBM 2006 plays out all the matches in full. Fully flexible, you can take control in the dugout, making all the calls you want between each pitch. You can call for all common baseball strategies, including double-steals, pitch-outs, suicide squeeze plays, pinch-runners and defensive substitutes. And make no mistake about it, your CPU counterpart is highly intelligent and will make smart decisions, resulting in a very challenging game-play.<br/>No computer baseball game would be perfect without loads of statistics. OOTPBM 2006 is the undisputed king of baseball games when it comes to stats. Not only do you get your usual fix, like batting average, ERA, assists or innings played. You also get special stats like VORP, Total Average, Runs Created and Secondary Average. And it doesn&rsquo;t end here, as the stats engine also offers splits and double splits! If you want to know how your star-shortstop is batting with 2 strikes in close ballgames on the road, no problem. Or check how many homeruns your closer has given up against left-handed batters in June this year &ndash; on a 1-1 pitch. The stats engine can produce millions of stats per player, so all the information you may need to make your decisions are at your fingertips.<br/><br/>- Customizable financial system<br/>Your league can feature a financial system which is the most realistic in any baseball game on the market. Just like almost every feature in OOTP, the financial system is optional and customizable. You want the 40-man roster rule, including the waiver-wire and minor league option years? Or do you prefer the old style without free agency and just trades? What about the Rule-5 draft or free agent compensation draft picks? OOTPBM 2006 offers you a lot of different setups to choose from, resulting in the most realistic or a casual experience, just the way you prefer it.<br/>If you use the typical setup, you have to care for a lot of things in order to compete. You decide which players you give contract extensions (maybe incentive-laden ones), or which ones you want to let go via free agency. Then in the off-season, you enter the bidding war for the most talented star players, offering well constructed multi-year contracts including optional bonus clauses and no-trade clauses. Also, you need to decide if you give high bonus money to a top draft pick or rather settle for the cheap local high-school hero. Players aren&rsquo;t the only ones who cost money however and you will need to take care of your coaching, scouting and management staff. And all you have is the budget that your owner dictates you!<br/><br/>- Scouting and coaching staff at your disposal<br/>Every team has a general manager and, in the case of your franchise, it&rsquo;s you. Additionally, each team in your organization has a manager, a bench-coach, a pitching- and hitting-coach, 6 scouts and a team doctor. Each of them has different skills and personalities, as well as contract demands. The quality of the staff influences your team performance in many different ways. A good pitching coach who has a great reputation for working with youngsters might just be the one who turns a decent prospect into a top prospect. Or your team doctor might be the difference between an injury-ridden team and one that benefits from healthy everyday-players. Scouts have abilities as well and a great scout has a better chance of discovering the next legend in Puerto Rico than an average scout. Select your staff wisely otherwise you will not have an edge over your competition.<br/><br/>- Endless possibilities with historical and fictional leagues<br/>OOTPBM 2006 offers the real life setup of every major baseball league in the world and in addition, you may also import every historical baseball season starting in 1900 from a freeware database (<a target='_blank' href='http://www.baseball1.com' rel='nofollow'>www.baseball1.com</a>), or simply create your own fictional baseball league. Best of all, all kind of leagues can co-exist in your baseball universe and compete with each other for players or interact in the form of trades. Setting up leagues is very simple. For example, you would like to have a league in Canada, with 3 minor league levels attached to. Simply select the number of sub-leagues/divisions/teams, then select the country, and with one button add 3 minor leagues. Just like that you have created the league you like, with randomized city and team nicknames! That way, you can for example create a baseball universe that has a league in the USA, 2 leagues in Japan and one league in every European country. And each league can have different financial options, AI options, schedule options etc. The possibilities are basically endless!<br/><br/>- Create or join an online league<br/>Competing against the computer AI is fun, but the real challenge is facing human competition. OOTPBM 2006 features a full online league mode where one commissioner and multiple owners play against each other. Online league commissioners and general managers can use FTP (file transfer protocol) functionality that is built directly into the game's interface. This allows both commissioners and league participants to upload and download league files without ever leaving the game. Commissioners can instantly upload every team's files with a single click. And since the FTP instructions are built directly into the game engine, no 3rd-party software is needed for file transfers - just an active Internet connection!<br/>If you thought file transfer was easy, wait until you hear about the Out of the Park Baseball Manager 2006 built in HTML reporting and web site creation features! In seconds you can generate a complete, statistics-rich web site, complete with an amazing assortment of hyperlinks. Want to see the complete history of the player that's leading your league in homeruns? Just click on him and his HTML card appears on your screen showing his complete history from the day of his initial amateur draft to the present.<br/><br/>- Slick intuitive interface<br/>OOTPBM 2006 offers so many features and so many options, that the interface has to be as powerful as the game. The new version of the game introduces a brand new, fully skinable interface. It features hyperlinks everywhere, right-click menus, drag &amp; drop, recent page history, bookmarks, an integrated HTML browser, customizable player lists (including custom filter setups) and much more. Not only does it look great, it makes your OOTPBM 2006 experience as comfortable as never before!<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "172749": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2397771.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Michael Dinnall"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "10", "boardgameartist": ["Devin Kraft"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ad Magic, Inc."], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2397771_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Humor", "Party Game"], "description": "How I got to the E.R is a party game that has no room for a solid plan and keeps the creative juices flowing, but thats what ultimately makes the game great!

Crusader<br/>He&rsquo;s the armored fist of the dark gods, crusading against demons &mdash; but happy to stomp out virtue or innocence if they&rsquo;re stupid enough to get in his way.<br/><br/>4. Diabolist<br/>Unlike the demons she controls, the Diabolist doesn&rsquo;t necessary want to destroy the universe. She wants to play with it, as a tiger plays with a troupe of monkeys. Those who dance best may not be eaten.<br/><br/>5. Dwarf King<br/>The Dwarf King remembers when his kingdom in the deeps was the mightiest in all creation. Forced towards the surface by elven treachery, he guards the Empire from threats such as the orcs while calculating how to claim the Empire for his own. Or maybe he&rsquo;s content to mine the treasures of the earth, and build great things that his ancestors would have coveted. Maybe.<br/><br/>6. Elf Queen<br/>Once upon a time, the Elf Queen united the dark elves, wood elves, and high elves as one people. Now she is the only thing they have in common.<br/><br/>7. Emperor<br/>The ruler of the Dragon Empire holds his Empire together with armies, magic, force of will, tolerably wise rule, and grand squadrons of dragons. You may not agree with him, but you&rsquo;re not going to mistake him for someone who does things halfway.<br/><br/>8. Great Gold Wyrm<br/>This great gold dragon is the champion of the oppressed and those who fight for justice. Unfortunately the Wyrm is stuck holding the gates of the hells shut against the demons, so the Wyrm&rsquo;s champions must do its work in the world.<br/><br/>9. High Druid<br/>She is the champion of the resurgent Wild, and the spiritual and magical leader of spirits of nature and the elements that were chained by the Emperor and Archmage but are now working themselves free.<br/><br/>10. Lich King<br/>The Lich King is the not-quite-insane lord of the undead, a fallen tyrant who plans to conquer the Dragon Empire. He mostly understands that ruling a kingdom is not the same as destroying it.<br/><br/>11. Orc Lord<br/>The leader of the hordes. An apocalyptic icon of war, disease, and endings that could be worse than death.<br/><br/>12. Priestess<br/>The gods are distant but she hears all the gods of light and speaks for those who please her. Part oracle, part mystic, and part metaphysical engineer, since she created the Cathedral, an ever-expanding temple with rooms or entire wings for each of the faiths she favors.<br/><br/>13. The Three<br/>Three ancient dragons cooperate to become one of the dominant evils of the world. The red dragon embodies fury, the black masters stealth and betrayal, and the blue has used sorcery to become a legally appointed governor of the Empire as well as an evil mastermind!<br/><br/>14. The Eyes of the Stone Thief<br/>The Stone Thief is a terrible centuries-old living dungeon that cuts through the earth, surfacing to swallow people and places that the heroes love.<br/><br/>15. Tales Around the Fire<br/>For the rare moments when nothing is trying to kill you.<br/><br/>16. Exploration<br/>Descending into the ruined temple. Opening the gates of the living dungeon. Moving in the dark down a corridor that might be made of stone, but then why is the stone breathing? Wind from up ahead, but it&rsquo;s not the wind from the surface. Welcome to the underworld.<br/><br/>17. The Demon Coast<br/>Coastlines can be bad business on the Midland Sea, home to all the evil things forced out of the ocean by the Empire&rsquo;s magic. The coast just north of the Abyss is even worse, hit by tides of evil from both directions.<br/><br/>18. The Fangs<br/>The rivers that feed into the Midland Sea are dangerous places and this is the worst of the bunch, fast moving forks of water populated by sahuagin and sea devils and other creatures forced out of the Midland Sea by the Blessed Emperor. Another great tune for ramping up the tension.<br/><br/>19. High Dock<br/>There aren&rsquo;t any actual docks in these rolling western hills, and the name may or may not be a joke. For magical reasons no one understands, all the flying realms of the Empire eventually drop low and bump up against the hills or take out big chunks of the terrain in terrible skidding &lsquo;landings.&rsquo; Eventually the realms lift off again. If you want to hitch a ride into the overworld, head to the High Dock and take your chances.<br/><br/>20. Omen<br/>This island started small. It&rsquo;s growing like a cancer in the center of the Midland Sea, bulking up the worst way possible as living dungeon after living dungeon tear up to the surface, depositing their payloads of monstrous weirdness. On the bright side, there&rsquo;s nobody competing for space on the beach, you should be able to catch a good thirty minutes of sun before the monsters smell you.<br/><br/>21. Starport<br/>The stars come to this mountain for repair and refitting. What does this mean, you ask? We don&rsquo;t know &mdash; we left it open for each game table to decide for themselves.<br/><br/>22. Dreams of a Lost Age<br/>Every culture in the world has its own version of this song. The world is ancient, all have lost things they would have wanted to preserve. They summon the dreams in song.<br/><br/>23. Chase Music<br/>Who is chasing who? Doesn&rsquo;t matter. Put it on loop to cue frantic backward glances, quick changes of direction, and short cuts that lead to greater peril.<br/><br/>24-30. Escalation 0 through Escalation 6<br/>You can use this music to accompany the escalation die, starting at 0 and topping off at 6; or loop the low levels for relatively normal situations, then switch to high levels when power makes the air hum.<br/><br/>"}, "172757": {"rpgdesigner": ["Shawn Carman", "Rich Wulf"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "The Thunder Trail", "rpgartist": ["Biagio D'Alessandro", "Edwin David", "Jason Engle", "ShenFei", "Jeremy Walker"], "rpgproducer": ["Mikael Brodu", "Shawn Carman", "Rob Dake", "Matthew Schenck", "Rich Wulf"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2398211.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgsetting": ["Thunderscape: The World of Aden"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Science Fiction (Post Apocalypse)", "Steampunk"], "rpgpublisher": ["Kyoudai Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Thunderscape World"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2398211_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the book:<br/><br/>Nothing can stop the Thunder Trains!<br/><br/>Many consider them the greatest creations mankind has ever wrought, while others believe they are a blight upon Aden.

It is based on the expired 1904 Elizabeth Magie patent for The Landlord's Game.<br/><br/>In 1934, Charles Darrow tried to sell his version of Monopoly to Milton Bradley, but they passed on it, knowing the real history of the game.  He took Monopoly to Parker Brothers and the rest is history.<br/><br/>As Monopoly began to become very popular in 1935, Milton Bradley came out with their own &quot;property trading&quot; game, Easy Money.  This was based in part on Monopoly and also Finance, which was another very similar game that had been on the market since 1932.<br/><br/>A race ensued to see who could patent this type of game first.  The patent office decided that these games were derived from The Landlord's Game.  Parker Brothers purchased the second Landlord's patent from Elizabeth Magie Phillips in November 1935, and Charles Darrow was granted a patent on Monopoly (as an &quot;improved version&quot;) the following month.<br/><br/>Parker Brothers then pressured Milton Bradley to change Easy Money, and remove what they considered aspects of the game that infringed on Monopoly.  This included the use of property cards.<br/><br/>Milton Bradley went along with this, but in 1937, perhaps as a bit of &quot;payback,&quot; they briefly marketed this game Carnival, based on the earlier (expired) Landlord's Game patent.  This game has what amounts to property cards (the &quot;Concessions&quot;).<br/><br/>So, it may very well be that this game was put on the market by Milton Bradley largely to thumb their noses at Parker Brothers.  There was nothing Parker could do to prevent it.<br/><br/>The iconography on the game board also ties it in directly to Easy Money, since the exact same Bank illustration is used.  There are also references to &quot;concessions&quot; and it's very possible this is all in the nature of &quot;subtext&quot; as part of a dialogue between the two major game makers.<br/><br/>It was only available for sale for a brief period of time, perhaps just long enough for Milton Bradley to make their point about patents.  Parker Brothers had been attempting to get a third trading game patent (and actually did so in Canada), but they gave up on the effort in the United States, and this game may have played a part in it.<br/><br/>If Milton Bradley had challenged the Monopoly patent in court, it likely would have been invalidated, and Parker Brothers knew this.<br/>Some of the other early Monopoly-related variants are quite valuable (the Knapp/Electronic Laboratories &quot;Finance,&quot; &quot;Boondoggling,&quot; Rudy Copeland's &quot;Inflation,&quot; Cadaco's &quot;Movie Mart,&quot; the 1935 version of &quot;Easy Money,&quot; etc.) and this game is just about as rare as these are.<br/><br/>"}, "172761": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing"], "statistics": [], "name": "Schermo del Game Master", "rpgartist": ["Paolo Barbieri"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpg": ["Dragonero"], "rpgpublisher": ["Wyrd Edizioni"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "poll": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "description": "From the publisher website:<br/>Proteggete i vostri appunti importanti e i risultati dei vostri tiri dagli sguardi curiosi dei giocatori con lo Schermo del GM di Dragonero GdR!<br/><br/>English translation:<br/>Protect your important notes and the results of your dice from the prying eyes of players with the Dragonero RPG Dm's Screen!<br/><br/>"}, "172762": {"rpgdesigner": ["Matteo Cortini"], "rpgitemversion": ["First printing"], "statistics": [], "name": "Anime e Sangue", "rpgartist": ["Federico Musetti"], "rpgproducer": ["Matteo Cortini", "Andrea Gualdi"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpg": ["Anime e Sangue"], "rpgpublisher": ["Raven Distribution"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "rpggenre": ["Multiverse", "Occult (Magic)"], "description": "From the back of the book:<br/>Esistono altre Realt&agrave;

STRANGE VOYAGES will tell the story of a grand ship and a crew gathered from the furthest reaches of known geography. Their travels take them to lands that no one has ever recorded: a sea made of gravel and sand; the mythical country of Faerie; the Cyclopes' caves; and even venturing into the land of dreams.<br/><br/>The mood of Strange Voyages is one of high adventure and exploration, a fusion of classical mythology, swashbuckling action, and Star Trek on the high seas.

This fundraising campaign starts with one of them &mdash; the core, fantastical game world of Dark &mdash; and expands out to include other settings, if you like. They all use the same main game rules and emphasize the same focus on stealth and intrigue but each world puts that central play activity into different contexts.<br/><br/>The game plays wonderfully with even just a single player and a gamemaster (GM). With one or two players, it feels like an infiltration game about sneaking into forbidden places and capturing loot or secrets. With more players &mdash; I play it with up to 4, plus a GM &mdash; it sometimes feels more like a fantastical heist, with lots of moving parts and a delicate balance between plans and opportunities.<br/><br/>Dark adventures can take the form of detailed environments, with pre-written conversations to overhear, or they can be randomly built by the GM as you play, using dice to inform the environment and determine the threats to the players' characters. The Dark text contains complete guidelines on both kinds of play &mdash; and I look forward to offering complete and detailed adventures for the game(s) throughout the year.<br/><br/>The worlds of Project: Dark are built to emphasize the dramatic and gameplay potential in playing thieves, spies, intruders, and trespassers in perilous worlds. Some adventures are about petty thievery &mdash; but sometimes this is a game about revolutionary skullduggery, internecine intrigue, shadowing enemies, and changing the world.

You barely had time to pick up the baby and your favorite fishing pole before they started the burning and pillaging. You wandered over a cruel desert, braved frozen peaks, and even paddled a log across a rough sea, kicking at the sharks whenever they got too close, the baby strapped tightly to your back.<br/><br/>Then you found it! The perfect place to make your new home. But as soon as you had the first hut built, you discovered a vast network of caverns underground, brimming with shiny treasures, rare resources, and untold adventure. How could you limit your new village to the surface? You immediately start organizing expeditions and building houses underground as well as on the surface.<br/><br/>With any luck, you'll build a village even stronger than your last-- strong enough, even, to turn away the barbarians the next time they come knocking.<br/><br/>Above and Below is a mashup of town-building and storytelling where you and up to three friends compete to build the best village above and below ground. In the game, you send your villagers to perform jobs like exploring the cave, harvesting resources, and constructing houses. Each villager has unique skills and abilities, and you must decide how to best use them. You have your own personal village board, and you slide the villagers on this board to various areas to indicate that they've been given jobs to do. Will you send Hanna along on the expedition to the cave? Or should she instead spend her time teaching important skills to one of the young villagers?<br/><br/>A great cavern lies below the surface, ready for you to explore-- this is where the storytelling comes in. When you send a group of villagers to explore the depths, one of your friends reads what happens to you from a book of paragraphs. You'll be given a choice of how to react, and a lot will depend on which villagers you brought on the expedition, and who you're willing to sacrifice to succeed. The book of paragraphs is packed with encounters of amazing adventure, randomly chosen each time you visit the cavern.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the player with the most well-developed village wins!<br/><br/>The Kickstarter version of the game included the following items which are not found in the Retail version:<br/><br/>     Villager Tool tokens<br/>     Lost Villagers<br/>     Swamp Villagers<br/>     Exclusive Stretch goals:<br/>     Creature Villagers<br/>     Quest Tokens<br/>     Underforest Tokens and PDF story book<br/>     Desert Labyrinth tokens and PDF story book <br/>     Wooden Goods<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This collection of items can be found in Above and Below: Expanded Edition exclusives<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition", "German first edition", "Italian edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "average": "7.69626", "name": "Above and Below", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Card Drafting", "Deck / Pool Building", "Dice Rolling", "Set Collection", "Storytelling", "Trading", "Worker Placement"], "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": ["Above and Below: Expanded Edition exclusives", "Above and Below: G@mebox Building promo card", "Above and Below: Groves", "Above and Below: Watch It Played Building promo card"], "usersrated": "5213", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Arzium Setting", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["#24: The HYPE Episode!

A good Passing allows a player to make longer passes.<br/>Control : used when a player kicks the ball, or attempts a Field Goal.<br/>Also the Control is used to give inspiration to teammates.<br/>Initiative : used when a player wants to perform complex movements (feint, jump, sprint, blitz).

For example, the Movement mode improves the movements of the players, allows to activate the entire team in some conditions, but the only action allowed is &quot;Moving&quot;. Same thing for the Pass mode. The Kick Mode activates only the ball carrier and allows to escape from adverse pressure.<br/>The Defense mode is the best mode if you want to tackle the opposing ball carrier, but this mode is available only if you roll the appropriate number on the dice...<br/><br/>E) End of game and scoring.<br/>You and your opponent agree on a time limit (45, 60 or 90 minutes), or on a maximum scoring (30 points for example), etc...<br/>A team scores with TouchDown (5 or 7 points), Field Goal (3 points), or eliminated opponents (2 points).<br/><br/>F) Style of Play.<br/>Special cards are provided with the game : they allow to customize the style of play for your team : Pass play, Run play, Aggressive Play, Tactical Play, Polyvalent play, Mixed play.<br/><br/>G) Edited february 18, 2016.

In the months that followed, staff officers from all three fleets prepared detailed plans for operations against the French and British fleets in the Mediterranean in case of war. Yet when war came in August 1914, Italy refused to join her Alliance partners and those plans would never be used.<br/><br/>What if Italy had honored her Alliance obligations, and joined the Germans and Austrians in a naval war against Britain and France? What if the Triple Alliance plans had been put into operation, with the Austrian and Italian fleets combining to challenge the French and British? The Great War at Sea in the Mediterranean is no longer confined to the Adriatic Sea, but now rages across the entire Mediterranean basin.<br/><br/>Triple Alliance is a book supplement for the Great War at Sea series based on those plans. It is not a complete game; ownership of Mediterranean and Dreadnoughts (and only Mediterranean and Dreadnoughts) is required to enjoy all of the scenarios.<br/><br/>The book includes 90 new scorchless, sootless laser-cut playing pieces. There are several versions of the Austrian battleship Radetzky, both the small dreadnought and full dreadnought variations presented by her design team in 1907. The all-big-gun battleship originally proposed for the Italian Navy by designer Vittorio Cuniberti is included, along with other ships cancelled for financial reasons. And the French receive a full class of unusual battleships proposed but never built, that carry the big guns of a dreadnought but also the not-quite-as-big guns of a semi-dreadnought.<br/><br/>And there are some pieces to replace armored cruisers and semi-dreadnoughts from our Mediterranean game, with gunnery ratings more accurately reflecting their capabilities. Plus new seaplane pieces rated for use with the aircraft rules that began to appear in Great War at Sea games after publication of the most recent edition of Mediterranean.<br/><br/>The thirty scenarios study the Triple Alliance war plan in a story all their own, following the outbreak of war and the conduct of operations as the joint planning staff foresaw possible events. The scenarios follow a single story arc, but also present a study of the Triple Alliance&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses.

Once it's out there, you can expect us to check in with you to see how it's working out and what we can do to improve it.<br/><br/>Eberron Update. This month's installment is relatively straightforward. We're rolling out some rules to help you convert your Eberron campaign to fifth edition. The Eberron campaign setting was created by Keith Baker and first published for D&amp;D in 2004. It combines pulp adventure and intrigue in a world where magic-driven technology has produced airships, trains, and similar advancements comparable to early 20th-century Europe. The continent of Khorvaire, the center of Eberron's focus, has recently emerged from the Last War, a terrible conflict that saw the kingdom of Cyre transformed into a lifeless gray wasteland called the Mournland. That catastrophe shocked the remaining kingdoms into an uneasy peace that has held so far.<br/><br/>Full details on the Eberron setting are available in several PDF products available through dndclassics.com. This article focuses on mechanical conversions for several of the key elements unique to Eberron.<br/><br/>"}, "172902": {"poll": [], "name": "UNO: Horses", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Horses", "UNO"], "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3134686_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Fundex"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3134686.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Tin box edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Card Game"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Test your steed's speed as the classic card game meets the world's most majestic breeds in the Horses edition of UNO.<br/><br/><br/>     112 Custom Cards featuring beautiful horses of all colors and breeds.<br/>     Same great UNO play PLUS the special Horseplay card, which forces other players to swap hands.<br/>     Be sure to shout &quot;UNO&quot; as you go for the win.<br/><br/><br/>"}, "172903": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2401944.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Emerson Matsuuchi"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Steven Hamilton"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Plaid Hat Games"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2401944_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Science Fiction"], "description": "Two promo cards given for free if you pre-ordered this game from Plaid Hat Games.<br/><br/>EMP Grenade:<br/>Reveal this card.

The environment is filled with debris that can be used as improvised weapons or shields. A martial artist might take advantage of the planks and pipes as weapons or toss boxes as feints. A tough guy might throw steel drums, tires, or even the TV or use the steel locker as a shield. A strong super hero might even throw the couch!<br/><br/>Back Alley is a single page map of a debris filled alleyway lot.<br/><br/>Back Alley is intended for use in modern, pulp adventure, post-apocalyptic, or super hero games.<br/><br/>Adventure Hook for use with this map:<br/><br/>Mysterious Donations: A local fraternity, Delta Epsilon Omicron, has stumbled upon a new party drug that a nerdy pledge cooked up for them. They have started selling it in a nearby back street alley behind the frat house. They are trying to make enough money to have the biggest frat party ever and become campus legends. The cash they make is being funneled to the frat house by &ldquo;anonymous&rdquo; donors. A local gang of drug dealers have taken notice of their recent drug sales and are not happy about them taking money out of their pockets.<br/><br/>The drug dealers have contacted the frat posing as college kids and set up a meeting to buy drugs from them tonight. The gang is actually going to wax them to get rid of the competition instead.<br/><br/>The Player Characters can be detectives or police officers who have become aware of the drug sales and are staking out the area that night in a sting operation to observe the sale and bust the frat boys and drug dealers. When the thugs come in to buy drugs and they start firing instead, they have to leap into action to save the frat kids if they can.<br/><br/>One twist is that the drug is actual a revenge cooked up by the nerdy pledge tired of hazing and bullying. Those who use the drug are driven to euphoria, but over time the drug starts to physically change its users into ugly monsters with each new dose. The frat boys turn into abominations in this case and rip the thugs apart. The Player Characters rush to save them, only to find themselves going up against hideous, muscle-bound creatures that barely react to pain despite bullet holes in them from the thugs. Another twist is that the Player Characters are actually super heroes who use the detective or police officer occupations as masks for their real identities and can fight this threat directly.<br/><br/>"}, "172911": {"rpgdesigner": ["Tim Callahan"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Hellspike", "rpgartist": ["William McAusland", "Frank Turfler"], "rpgproducer": ["Joseph P.

Players draw from the Adventurer deck that contains cards of 5 different colors all numbered 1-12.  With these cards players form combinations to attempt a Strike (cards in a row of any color), a Stomp (cards of the same number) or a Scream (cards of the same color).

Be careful about wandering too far, though, as the air hose connecting you to the ship and all that sweet, sweet oxygen is only so long and it'd be a real shame if the ship got hit by a sudden typhoon and was sent careening away...<br/><br/>Exploring a new tile nets you a number of cards (listed on the tile itself) from the game's four decks that could be the specimens you're looking to collect, environmental events that shake the game up, or shenanigans that you can use against other players (or keep for later).  You've only got so much space, though, so at the end of your turn you can only keep two cards.

With the medieval watchtower captured, the invading army hopes to catch the keep with its guard down for an easy night ambush. The group must capture or kill the four soldiers and prevent them from warning the castle. The group must then escape the watchtower and meet up with their employer leading them to the keep as their employer is leading the force assaulting the castle. If they succeeded in time, their employer pays them in the courtyard and asks them to help in the final assault against the inner keep for more pay. If they did not succeed in time, he refuses to pay them on the outskirts of the keep and bids them adieu as he reconsiders his attack after losing the element of surprise and meeting stiff resistance. This may anger the group. They might attack their former employer or even attempt to convince the besieged castle defenders to allow them to switch sides and join in the defense of the keep.<br/><br/>A reverse of this scenario could be the group is hired as night watchmen to protect the keep when the enemy sends assassins to kill them.<br/><br/>"}, "172987": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["Photoshop version"], "poll": [], "name": "Morph Recognition Hack Pack", "rpgartist": ["Christine Bian", "Adam Burn", "Daniel Clarke", "Trevor Claxton", "Danijel Firak", "Tom Garden", "Nathan Geppert", "Sam Hogg", "Lake Hurwitz", "Thomas H.
