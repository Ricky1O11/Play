Players could accept Lifechained feats to enter this ecosystem, gaining incredible powers, at the cost of heightened vulnerability to an assortment of truly terrifying monsters.<br/><br/>Horrors of the Lifechain focuses on the Lifechain as a source of endless new threats for heroes to battle. It collects the revised Lifespawn originally presented in Dark Star Bestiary I &amp; II, and returns them to their natural habitat: deep space of the Otherverse America campaign setting. It also pulls in a few beings from the well-received Space Monsters series of mini-bestiaries: the revamped Chyss work great as Nemesis-bloodline Lifespawn conquerors, and make Phallus Space that much more dangerous.

Recruit fearless Heroes and discover powerful Artifacts as you amass your forces. Will you master arcane magic or win through the strength of steel? Champions can even join together to take on greater threats as they vie for the most Glory.<br/><br/>Players start the game with two Lands under their control. Each turn, the controlling Champion (the player whose turn it is) rolls a ten-sided die for Production. The result of the role is compared to their Lands and Resources are acquired by all players accordingly. The controlling Champion can then use acquired Resources to expand to new Lands (thereby increasing their Resource production), recruit Heroes (cards) to increase their Magic and/or Combat power, improve their land with Tower Upgrades that add to the Production roll's result, or purchase Artifacts (cards) that give Glory and additional passive or active benefits. Additionally, players may undertake secret Quests that provide Glory, primarily, at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The main source of Glory, however, is Battle. The controlling Champion will end his or her turn with the option of sending forces into Battle, challenging their choice of Rank 1-5. In Battle, Champions must choose whether they will fight with the strength of Combat or the power of Magic. The chosen Battle Rank card is turned over and the controlling Champion faces the challenge by rolling a ten-sided die and adding their chosen power. If the result exceeds the target, they win and receive both Glory and Reward (in the form of Resources). If they lose, Glory is lost.<br/><br/>Additionally, the controlling Champion may solicit aid from another player before the Battle begins. Players can combine their powers to take on greater threats (and earn greater Glory) than they could on their own.<br/><br/>End game is triggered when a player reaches 144 Glory (tracked around the edge of the game board).

Out of fuel, you set down in a crater and view the airless landscape before you. Somewhere there are the fuel tanks you need. <br/>Can you find them in time?<br/><br/>Aim of the Game!<br/>In this solitaire game, you must find three rocket fuel tanks and return to your spaceship before your spacesuit runs out of oxygen or battery power. If either of these levels drops below 1 during a systems check, you have lost the game.<br/><br/>Needed to Play!<br/>The deck of Map Cards (30 cards)<br/>The deck of Event and Equipment Cards (21 cards)<br/>1 Suit Card showing your remaining oxygen and battery power + 2 Tracking Cards which also include the Quick Rules Guide<br/>1 Astronaut, 1 Spaceship, and 3 Fuel Tank counters<br/><br/>Setting the Game Up!<br/>Shuffle the Map deck and deal the cards out face down in a 6 x 5 grid, there will be 5 rows of cards, each row will have 6 cards in it.<br/><br/>Find the card on the grid with the Spaceship icon on it and turn this card over to the other side, placing your Spaceship and Astronaut on it.<br/><br/>Playing the Game!<br/>Each turn of the game will consist of 3 phases:<br/><br/>Phase 1. Movement<br/>At the beginning of your turn you must move your Astronaut, from the card it is currently on, any number of cards in an orthogonal direction (this means up or down, left or right). The first two cards in distance you move you may do so for free. For each additional card you move during the turn you must lose either 1 level of your Oxygen or 1 level of your Battery Power. Move the Tracking Cards down the Oxygen or Battery tracks as needed to record this. You may change directions as you move (i.e. 1 card to the left and then one card up). You may never move diagonally.<br/><br/>You are trying to find, using your spacesuit&rsquo;s equipment, a series of numbered beacons (in pairs) which will locate where the 3 Fuel Tanks are stored. These beacons give you a set of coordinates (one beacon points up and down, the other points left and right). You will need to locate the pair of matching numbered beacons and then move to the card the beacons point to. In the example to the right, X marks the spot where one of the Fuel Tanks is located.<br/><br/>Phase 2. Events and Equipment<br/>After you have finished moving you must now draw 3 cards from the Events and Equipment deck. This deck has two types of cards.<br/>If this deck is empty when you go to draw a card, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck to draw cards from.<br/><br/>A. Event Cards - these cause you to lose Oxygen or Battery Power due to your exploration.<br/>B. Equipment Cards - these cause you to gain resources you need (Oxygen and Battery Power), as well as give you special actions to help in your exploration.<br/><br/>Keep the Equipment cards in your hand from one turn to the next. You will need a pair of the same cards to gain the listed bonus. You may have no more than three Equipment cards in your hand at the end of the Events and Equipment phase.<br/><br/>Phase 3. Systems Check<br/>You must now check your Suit Systems. If either your Oxygen or Battery Power level is below 1 you have lost the game. Do not forget that you may spend a pair of matching cards at anytime during the System Check phase (Phase 3) to gain the listed bonus, by placing the cards on the discard pile.<br/><br/>"}, "172559": {"boardgamedesigner": {"79462": {"name": "Wilfried Fort"}}, "average": "5.90328", "poll": {}, "name": "Targets", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "61", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3372683_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"50571": "Brian Kolodziejski"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"6760": {"name": "Blackrock Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3372683.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"324586": "English-only first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "In Targets, players don't roll their dice, but flick them from the top of a tower to try to land them on targets placed in the playing area.

Players are challenged to think creatively and use only three types of sticks to create geometric shapes. In each turn, players add two sticks to the board and earn points for the shapes created. With compelling game mechanics and exciting surprises, Three Sticks is a promising entertainer for both kids and adults.<br/><br/>Players begin with six sticks, chosen randomly using reload cards. The three types of sticks, purple, orange and red, are 3, 4 and 5 units long respectively and can be placed along the blue dots marked on the board. While all three sticks can be placed horizontally or vertically, red stick can also be placed diagonally.<br/><br/>Each player places two sticks in their turn, with each stick's tip touching the tip of at least one other stick on the board. If a geometric shape is created in the process, the player earns points. Points are awarded as per three parameters :<br/>1. Perimeter of the shape <br/>2. Bonus as per the type of the shape <br/>3. Points in blue circles, if the shape surrounds any such circles on the board.<br/><br/>Once all six sticks are used, a player may collect six more by picking a reload card. Additionally, five power cards are distributed to each player at the beginning of the game. These cards provide special powers to the players that can improve their position in the game or slow down the progress of other players. The cards may be used in any turn up to a maximum of two per turn.<br/><br/>The first player to reach a score of 500 wins the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"265258": "First edition"}, "age": "10", "name": "Three Sticks", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2039": "Line Drawing"}, "average": "6.512", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"16972": "Crowdfunding: Indiegogo"}}, "172577": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Cult of Selket", "rpgproducer": {"13384": "Wolfgang Baur"}, "usersrated": "0", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2392240.png", "rpgitemversion": {"265259": "PDF version"}, "rpgsetting": {"2726": "Midgard"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"26712": "Demon Cults"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2392240_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/><br/>The Scorpion&rsquo;s Sting!<br/><br/>The City of Scorpions lies ruined and forgotten in the burning wastes, its goddess Selket forsaken by civilized people.

Choose to remain an independent vagabond, or maybe cut a deal with a Governor to become all official-like in your pirating ways. Consult with a shaman to curse the other pirates or pay a visit to the cartographer to find a map with some hidden treasure.<br/><br/>In the game, the turn begins with players choosing the character card whose action they want to play &mdash; because each character has its own ability to help you get rich quickly &mdash; and places it facedown in front of them. When everyone has chosen their character cards, the first player announces the characters one by one. When you hear your character, you reveal your character card and play your adventure, curse, or port card, and everyone gets involved in a new adventure, which usually ends with a grandiose sea battles, or some curse, or finding a new port.<br/><br/>The pirate with the most booty wins the day, but a pirate's life isn't always on the up and up.

Unit's and counters represent squads, individual tanks, support weapons, crews, etc.<br/><br/>This game can be played either stand alone with miniatures for 15mm, GHQ, or HO miniatures. The company also has several hex map and counter add on modules that can be used for more traditional non-miniatures based play.<br/><br/>DOV is a fast paced set of game rules that strikes a good balance between realism in war game simulation play and playability. Unit cards contain detailed weapons, vehicle and nationality based attributes that give players a crisp experience of the small scaled fighting realities of that historical era.<br/><br/>When combined with the add on modules for Flags of Valour, this system also integrates with a new kind of Fog of War set of mechanics never before used in war gaming.<br/><br/>The base rules are an 80 page booklet, 12 page data book, Command and STRAT cards, along with a sheet of control and marking counters for Unit Status.<br/><br/>Comes with data cards on the vast majority of German, American, Russian, British, and Commonwealth troops used during World War 2.<br/><br/>"}, "172622": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Raging Thunder", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"265317": "Android edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"26719": "Raging Thunder"}, "videogametheme": {"2456": "Driving"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2154": "Racing"}, "videogameplatform": {"6063": "Android"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Not a realistic racing simulator, Raging Thunder is a game based on tried and true arcade values.

Example: If there are 6 players and only 3 Playing Field hexes, the game could get congested.<br/><br/>Modified game (Number of Pawns/Cards per Person):  To make the game harder or easier, players can start off with more or less than 3 pawns.

Whether you're making it out of clockwork and enchanted metals in the Fantasy Era, alloy and laminate in the Near-Modern Era, or using bio-polymers and smart-carbon in the Space Era, it's all the same thing; Mechanica.<br/><br/>This companion for the Victory System includes over a hundred and fifty items of Mechanica for your Victory System campaigns.  Choose from prosthetic replacements to whole-body enhancements and sensory gear to surpass the functionality of mere flesh and bone.  Make a Character into a cyborg a bit at a time, or go full out and convert the intellect into living data to occupy a super-powerful artificial body.<br/><br/>Just be warned; Mechanica is a relatively quick path to tremendous power and enhanced abilities, but there might be a price to pay beyond money.  For every bit of metal that strengthens the Character, a bit of flesh must be discarded.  One should wonder how much of a person can be replaced before that person isn't that person any more.<br/><br/>This is a supplement for The Victory System; you will need the Core Rulebook to play.  This book updates the Mechanica selections avaiable in the Victory System Core Rulebook, Beasts of Victory, and Prosthetica.

That's the world of Steam Spy, a Steampunk themed role playing card game for 2 players. Steam Spy unites the character development and narrative of a traditional role playing game with the intimacy and spontaneity of a card game.<br/><br/>Players create a unique secret agent character who works for one of the organizations designated to protect and serve one of the world&rsquo;s largest corporations. Then they face off against an operative from an opposing secret industrial organization in a one on one battle of wits, luck and exotic steampunk gadgets. One player instigates some kind of espionage mission while the other does their best to stop them.<br/><br/>Players collect, play and draw cards that help create a series of exciting encounters that ultimately determine if the instigating antagonists succeeds at their mission, or the determined protagonist chases them down and defeats them; players then advance their spy character, or create a group of secret agent specialists in preparation for the next face off against operatives from opposing agencies and corporation.<br/><br/>Steam Spy: Intelligence and Propaganda includes allows you to become one of the top spies for M5, the Western European agency that works to collect and protect information for the massive Encyclopedia Englandia Corporation.

You may create any baseball universe you like, for example with the real league setup, a historic leagues, or totally fictional leagues. The number of leagues within your virtual baseball universe is not limited so you may have as many leagues and minor leagues as you like.<br/>Managing your baseball franchise takes a lot of knowledge and skills but OOTPB 2006 offers you all the tools you will need to succeed. You can set up your roster, lineups, depth charts and your pitching staff. Sign new players, demote them to the minors or release fading veterans. Initiate trades, respond to trade offers and make the right decisions in the first-year player drafts. In a word, anything a real GM does can be done in OOTPBM 2006. You have the power to guide your team into the infinite future. But beware; you might get fired if your calls result in your team finishing under .500 all the time.<br/><br/>- A realistic and accurate simulation engine<br/>Using a highly realistic and accurate baseball simulation engine, OOTPBM 2006 plays out all the matches in full. Fully flexible, you can take control in the dugout, making all the calls you want between each pitch. You can call for all common baseball strategies, including double-steals, pitch-outs, suicide squeeze plays, pinch-runners and defensive substitutes. And make no mistake about it, your CPU counterpart is highly intelligent and will make smart decisions, resulting in a very challenging game-play.<br/>No computer baseball game would be perfect without loads of statistics. OOTPBM 2006 is the undisputed king of baseball games when it comes to stats. Not only do you get your usual fix, like batting average, ERA, assists or innings played. You also get special stats like VORP, Total Average, Runs Created and Secondary Average. And it doesn&rsquo;t end here, as the stats engine also offers splits and double splits! If you want to know how your star-shortstop is batting with 2 strikes in close ballgames on the road, no problem. Or check how many homeruns your closer has given up against left-handed batters in June this year &ndash; on a 1-1 pitch. The stats engine can produce millions of stats per player, so all the information you may need to make your decisions are at your fingertips.<br/><br/>- Customizable financial system<br/>Your league can feature a financial system which is the most realistic in any baseball game on the market. Just like almost every feature in OOTP, the financial system is optional and customizable. You want the 40-man roster rule, including the waiver-wire and minor league option years? Or do you prefer the old style without free agency and just trades? What about the Rule-5 draft or free agent compensation draft picks? OOTPBM 2006 offers you a lot of different setups to choose from, resulting in the most realistic or a casual experience, just the way you prefer it.<br/>If you use the typical setup, you have to care for a lot of things in order to compete. You decide which players you give contract extensions (maybe incentive-laden ones), or which ones you want to let go via free agency. Then in the off-season, you enter the bidding war for the most talented star players, offering well constructed multi-year contracts including optional bonus clauses and no-trade clauses. Also, you need to decide if you give high bonus money to a top draft pick or rather settle for the cheap local high-school hero. Players aren&rsquo;t the only ones who cost money however and you will need to take care of your coaching, scouting and management staff. And all you have is the budget that your owner dictates you!<br/><br/>- Scouting and coaching staff at your disposal<br/>Every team has a general manager and, in the case of your franchise, it&rsquo;s you. Additionally, each team in your organization has a manager, a bench-coach, a pitching- and hitting-coach, 6 scouts and a team doctor. Each of them has different skills and personalities, as well as contract demands. The quality of the staff influences your team performance in many different ways. A good pitching coach who has a great reputation for working with youngsters might just be the one who turns a decent prospect into a top prospect. Or your team doctor might be the difference between an injury-ridden team and one that benefits from healthy everyday-players. Scouts have abilities as well and a great scout has a better chance of discovering the next legend in Puerto Rico than an average scout. Select your staff wisely otherwise you will not have an edge over your competition.<br/><br/>- Endless possibilities with historical and fictional leagues<br/>OOTPBM 2006 offers the real life setup of every major baseball league in the world and in addition, you may also import every historical baseball season starting in 1900 from a freeware database (<a target='_blank' href='http://www.baseball1.com' rel='nofollow'>www.baseball1.com</a>), or simply create your own fictional baseball league. Best of all, all kind of leagues can co-exist in your baseball universe and compete with each other for players or interact in the form of trades. Setting up leagues is very simple. For example, you would like to have a league in Canada, with 3 minor league levels attached to. Simply select the number of sub-leagues/divisions/teams, then select the country, and with one button add 3 minor leagues. Just like that you have created the league you like, with randomized city and team nicknames! That way, you can for example create a baseball universe that has a league in the USA, 2 leagues in Japan and one league in every European country. And each league can have different financial options, AI options, schedule options etc. The possibilities are basically endless!<br/><br/>- Create or join an online league<br/>Competing against the computer AI is fun, but the real challenge is facing human competition. OOTPBM 2006 features a full online league mode where one commissioner and multiple owners play against each other. Online league commissioners and general managers can use FTP (file transfer protocol) functionality that is built directly into the game's interface. This allows both commissioners and league participants to upload and download league files without ever leaving the game. Commissioners can instantly upload every team's files with a single click. And since the FTP instructions are built directly into the game engine, no 3rd-party software is needed for file transfers - just an active Internet connection!<br/>If you thought file transfer was easy, wait until you hear about the Out of the Park Baseball Manager 2006 built in HTML reporting and web site creation features! In seconds you can generate a complete, statistics-rich web site, complete with an amazing assortment of hyperlinks. Want to see the complete history of the player that's leading your league in homeruns? Just click on him and his HTML card appears on your screen showing his complete history from the day of his initial amateur draft to the present.<br/><br/>- Slick intuitive interface<br/>OOTPBM 2006 offers so many features and so many options, that the interface has to be as powerful as the game. The new version of the game introduces a brand new, fully skinable interface. It features hyperlinks everywhere, right-click menus, drag &amp; drop, recent page history, bookmarks, an integrated HTML browser, customizable player lists (including custom filter setups) and much more. Not only does it look great, it makes your OOTPBM 2006 experience as comfortable as never before!<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "172749": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2397771.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"80286": {"name": "Michael Dinnall"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "10", "boardgameartist": {"80287": "Devin Kraft"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"23584": {"name": "Ad Magic, Inc."}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2397771_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "How I got to the E.R is a party game that has no room for a solid plan and keeps the creative juices flowing, but thats what ultimately makes the game great!

Demons invade, living dungeons rip towards the surface and the Empire&rsquo;s protectors falter. A sweeping anthem for the heroes who will save the world, or die trying.<br/><br/>2. Archmage<br/>He has preserved the Empire for centuries and created astonishing new lands. He has also threatened the fabric of reality with experiments you&rsquo;d have to be brilliant or hugely arrogant to attempt.<br/><br/>3. Crusader<br/>He&rsquo;s the armored fist of the dark gods, crusading against demons &mdash; but happy to stomp out virtue or innocence if they&rsquo;re stupid enough to get in his way.<br/><br/>4. Diabolist<br/>Unlike the demons she controls, the Diabolist doesn&rsquo;t necessary want to destroy the universe. She wants to play with it, as a tiger plays with a troupe of monkeys. Those who dance best may not be eaten.<br/><br/>5. Dwarf King<br/>The Dwarf King remembers when his kingdom in the deeps was the mightiest in all creation. Forced towards the surface by elven treachery, he guards the Empire from threats such as the orcs while calculating how to claim the Empire for his own. Or maybe he&rsquo;s content to mine the treasures of the earth, and build great things that his ancestors would have coveted. Maybe.<br/><br/>6. Elf Queen<br/>Once upon a time, the Elf Queen united the dark elves, wood elves, and high elves as one people. Now she is the only thing they have in common.<br/><br/>7. Emperor<br/>The ruler of the Dragon Empire holds his Empire together with armies, magic, force of will, tolerably wise rule, and grand squadrons of dragons. You may not agree with him, but you&rsquo;re not going to mistake him for someone who does things halfway.<br/><br/>8. Great Gold Wyrm<br/>This great gold dragon is the champion of the oppressed and those who fight for justice. Unfortunately the Wyrm is stuck holding the gates of the hells shut against the demons, so the Wyrm&rsquo;s champions must do its work in the world.<br/><br/>9. High Druid<br/>She is the champion of the resurgent Wild, and the spiritual and magical leader of spirits of nature and the elements that were chained by the Emperor and Archmage but are now working themselves free.<br/><br/>10. Lich King<br/>The Lich King is the not-quite-insane lord of the undead, a fallen tyrant who plans to conquer the Dragon Empire. He mostly understands that ruling a kingdom is not the same as destroying it.<br/><br/>11. Orc Lord<br/>The leader of the hordes. An apocalyptic icon of war, disease, and endings that could be worse than death.<br/><br/>12. Priestess<br/>The gods are distant but she hears all the gods of light and speaks for those who please her. Part oracle, part mystic, and part metaphysical engineer, since she created the Cathedral, an ever-expanding temple with rooms or entire wings for each of the faiths she favors.<br/><br/>13. The Three<br/>Three ancient dragons cooperate to become one of the dominant evils of the world. The red dragon embodies fury, the black masters stealth and betrayal, and the blue has used sorcery to become a legally appointed governor of the Empire as well as an evil mastermind!<br/><br/>14. The Eyes of the Stone Thief<br/>The Stone Thief is a terrible centuries-old living dungeon that cuts through the earth, surfacing to swallow people and places that the heroes love.<br/><br/>15. Tales Around the Fire<br/>For the rare moments when nothing is trying to kill you.<br/><br/>16. Exploration<br/>Descending into the ruined temple. Opening the gates of the living dungeon. Moving in the dark down a corridor that might be made of stone, but then why is the stone breathing? Wind from up ahead, but it&rsquo;s not the wind from the surface. Welcome to the underworld.<br/><br/>17. The Demon Coast<br/>Coastlines can be bad business on the Midland Sea, home to all the evil things forced out of the ocean by the Empire&rsquo;s magic. The coast just north of the Abyss is even worse, hit by tides of evil from both directions.<br/><br/>18. The Fangs<br/>The rivers that feed into the Midland Sea are dangerous places and this is the worst of the bunch, fast moving forks of water populated by sahuagin and sea devils and other creatures forced out of the Midland Sea by the Blessed Emperor. Another great tune for ramping up the tension.<br/><br/>19. High Dock<br/>There aren&rsquo;t any actual docks in these rolling western hills, and the name may or may not be a joke. For magical reasons no one understands, all the flying realms of the Empire eventually drop low and bump up against the hills or take out big chunks of the terrain in terrible skidding &lsquo;landings.&rsquo; Eventually the realms lift off again. If you want to hitch a ride into the overworld, head to the High Dock and take your chances.<br/><br/>20. Omen<br/>This island started small. It&rsquo;s growing like a cancer in the center of the Midland Sea, bulking up the worst way possible as living dungeon after living dungeon tear up to the surface, depositing their payloads of monstrous weirdness. On the bright side, there&rsquo;s nobody competing for space on the beach, you should be able to catch a good thirty minutes of sun before the monsters smell you.<br/><br/>21.

It is based on the expired 1904 Elizabeth Magie patent for The Landlord's Game.<br/><br/>In 1934, Charles Darrow tried to sell his version of Monopoly to Milton Bradley, but they passed on it, knowing the real history of the game.  He took Monopoly to Parker Brothers and the rest is history.<br/><br/>As Monopoly began to become very popular in 1935, Milton Bradley came out with their own &quot;property trading&quot; game, Easy Money.  This was based in part on Monopoly and also Finance, which was another very similar game that had been on the market since 1932.<br/><br/>A race ensued to see who could patent this type of game first.  The patent office decided that these games were derived from The Landlord's Game.  Parker Brothers purchased the second Landlord's patent from Elizabeth Magie Phillips in November 1935, and Charles Darrow was granted a patent on Monopoly (as an &quot;improved version&quot;) the following month.<br/><br/>Parker Brothers then pressured Milton Bradley to change Easy Money, and remove what they considered aspects of the game that infringed on Monopoly.  This included the use of property cards.<br/><br/>Milton Bradley went along with this, but in 1937, perhaps as a bit of &quot;payback,&quot; they briefly marketed this game Carnival, based on the earlier (expired) Landlord's Game patent.  This game has what amounts to property cards (the &quot;Concessions&quot;).<br/><br/>So, it may very well be that this game was put on the market by Milton Bradley largely to thumb their noses at Parker Brothers.  There was nothing Parker could do to prevent it.<br/><br/>The iconography on the game board also ties it in directly to Easy Money, since the exact same Bank illustration is used.  There are also references to &quot;concessions&quot; and it's very possible this is all in the nature of &quot;subtext&quot; as part of a dialogue between the two major game makers.<br/><br/>It was only available for sale for a brief period of time, perhaps just long enough for Milton Bradley to make their point about patents.  Parker Brothers had been attempting to get a third trading game patent (and actually did so in Canada), but they gave up on the effort in the United States, and this game may have played a part in it.<br/><br/>If Milton Bradley had challenged the Monopoly patent in court, it likely would have been invalidated, and Parker Brothers knew this.<br/>Some of the other early Monopoly-related variants are quite valuable (the Knapp/Electronic Laboratories &quot;Finance,&quot; &quot;Boondoggling,&quot; Rudy Copeland's &quot;Inflation,&quot; Cadaco's &quot;Movie Mart,&quot; the 1935 version of &quot;Easy Money,&quot; etc.) and this game is just about as rare as these are.<br/><br/>"}, "172761": {"rpg": {"23878": "Dragonero"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Schermo del Game Master", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"265575": "First Printing"}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "poll": {}, "description": "From the publisher website:<br/>Proteggete i vostri appunti importanti e i risultati dei vostri tiri dagli sguardi curiosi dei giocatori con lo Schermo del GM di Dragonero GdR!<br/><br/>English translation:<br/>Protect your important notes and the results of your dice from the prying eyes of players with the Dragonero RPG Dm's Screen!<br/><br/>"}, "172762": {"rpgitemversion": {"265576": "First printing"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Anime e Sangue", "rpgproducer": {"4435": "Matteo Cortini"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3623676.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"21883": "Anime e Sangue"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpggenre": {"962": "Multiverse"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3623676_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the book:<br/>Esistono altre Realt&agrave;

If players are tied for influence, then they sum the market tokens and area wealth and split this, rounding down.<br/><br/>When all markets are controlled, or all players are out of tiles, or all canals have been placed, the game ends and the wealthiest player wins.<br/><br/>Canals of Amsterdam includes two variants, one in which each player starts with a single canal in reserve that can be used at any time on their turn and another in which players each have a hand of three influence tokens.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/><br/>\u4e16\u754c\u907a\u7523\u30a2\u30e0\u30b9\u30c6\u30eb\u30c0\u30e0\u306e\u904b\u6cb3\u3092\u5efa\u7bc9\u3057\u3001\u8857\u3092\u5206\u5272\u3057\u3066\u652f\u914d\u3059\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3002\u5206\u5272\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30a8\u30ea\u30a2\u5185\u3067\u5e02\u5834\u30de\u30b9\u304c\uff11\uff5e\uff12\u30de\u30b9\u306b\u306a\u308c\u3070\u30a8\u30ea\u30a2\u304c\u78ba\u5b9a\u3057\u3001\u305d\u306e\u6bb5\u968e\u3067\u3088\u308a\u5927\u304d\u306a\u5f71\u97ff\u529b\u3092\u30a8\u30ea\u30a2\u5185\u306b\u53ca\u307c\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308c\u3070\u30a8\u30ea\u30a2\u5185\u5e02\u5834\u3068\u571f\u5730\u3092\u652f\u914d\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002<br/><br/>"}, "172772": {"boardgamedesigner": {"80356": {"name": "\u6a2b\u5c3e\u5fe0\u82f1\u3000(Kashio Tadahide)"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Dorako no Yamawake", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2399650_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"80356": "\u6a2b\u5c3e\u5fe0\u82f1\u3000(Kashio Tadahide)"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"29159": {"name": "\u30ac\u30fc\u30c7\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba (The Garden Games)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2399650.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"265588": "Japanese first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "User summary:<br/>\u30c9\u30e9\u30b3\u306e\u5c71\u5206\u3051\u3000(Dorako no Yamawake) is a pirate themed card game.

All of Europe is eager to find new lands, new sources of fame and wealth, and belief in myth and legend is still alive. STRANGE VOYAGES will tell the story of a grand ship and a crew gathered from the furthest reaches of known geography. Their travels take them to lands that no one has ever recorded: a sea made of gravel and sand; the mythical country of Faerie; the Cyclopes' caves; and even venturing into the land of dreams.<br/><br/>The mood of Strange Voyages is one of high adventure and exploration, a fusion of classical mythology, swashbuckling action, and Star Trek on the high seas. However, along with the explorations come dangers, primarily in conflict with the tyrannical kings of Atlantis, who have ruled over many hidden mythological lands for millennia. The ship itself is not free from conflict, as religions, cultures, and sexes clash at the rise of the modern age.<br/><br/>Strange Voyages is a setting for the award-winning Fate Core roleplaying game. Combined with a copy of Fate Core (available as a pay-what-you-like pdf from evilhat.com), it provides all the rules you&rsquo;ll need to turn your Fate Core game into a swashbuckling adventure in the lands of legend.

This fundraising campaign starts with one of them &mdash; the core, fantastical game world of Dark &mdash; and expands out to include other settings, if you like. They all use the same main game rules and emphasize the same focus on stealth and intrigue but each world puts that central play activity into different contexts.<br/><br/>The game plays wonderfully with even just a single player and a gamemaster (GM). With one or two players, it feels like an infiltration game about sneaking into forbidden places and capturing loot or secrets. With more players &mdash; I play it with up to 4, plus a GM &mdash; it sometimes feels more like a fantastical heist, with lots of moving parts and a delicate balance between plans and opportunities.<br/><br/>Dark adventures can take the form of detailed environments, with pre-written conversations to overhear, or they can be randomly built by the GM as you play, using dice to inform the environment and determine the threats to the players' characters. The Dark text contains complete guidelines on both kinds of play &mdash; and I look forward to offering complete and detailed adventures for the game(s) throughout the year.<br/><br/>The worlds of Project: Dark are built to emphasize the dramatic and gameplay potential in playing thieves, spies, intruders, and trespassers in perilous worlds. Some adventures are about petty thievery &mdash; but sometimes this is a game about revolutionary skullduggery, internecine intrigue, shadowing enemies, and changing the world.

You barely had time to pick up the baby and your favorite fishing pole before they started the burning and pillaging. You wandered over a cruel desert, braved frozen peaks, and even paddled a log across a rough sea, kicking at the sharks whenever they got too close, the baby strapped tightly to your back.<br/><br/>Then you found it! The perfect place to make your new home. But as soon as you had the first hut built, you discovered a vast network of caverns underground, brimming with shiny treasures, rare resources, and untold adventure. How could you limit your new village to the surface? You immediately start organizing expeditions and building houses underground as well as on the surface.<br/><br/>With any luck, you'll build a village even stronger than your last-- strong enough, even, to turn away the barbarians the next time they come knocking.<br/><br/>Above and Below is a mashup of town-building and storytelling where you and up to three friends compete to build the best village above and below ground. In the game, you send your villagers to perform jobs like exploring the cave, harvesting resources, and constructing houses. Each villager has unique skills and abilities, and you must decide how to best use them. You have your own personal village board, and you slide the villagers on this board to various areas to indicate that they've been given jobs to do. Will you send Hanna along on the expedition to the cave? Or should she instead spend her time teaching important skills to one of the young villagers?<br/><br/>A great cavern lies below the surface, ready for you to explore-- this is where the storytelling comes in. When you send a group of villagers to explore the depths, one of your friends reads what happens to you from a book of paragraphs. You'll be given a choice of how to react, and a lot will depend on which villagers you brought on the expedition, and who you're willing to sacrifice to succeed.

Leader.   b. Receiver.   c. Marauder.  d.

Etc..<br/><br/>You don't have any figure ?

A good Passing allows a player to make longer passes.<br/>Control : used when a player kicks the ball, or attempts a Field Goal.<br/>Also the Control is used to give inspiration to teammates.<br/>Initiative : used when a player wants to perform complex movements (feint, jump, sprint, blitz).

For example, the Movement mode improves the movements of the players, allows to activate the entire team in some conditions, but the only action allowed is &quot;Moving&quot;. Same thing for the Pass mode. The Kick Mode activates only the ball carrier and allows to escape from adverse pressure.<br/>The Defense mode is the best mode if you want to tackle the opposing ball carrier, but this mode is available only if you roll the appropriate number on the dice...<br/><br/>E) End of game and scoring.<br/>You and your opponent agree on a time limit (45, 60 or 90 minutes), or on a maximum scoring (30 points for example), etc...<br/>A team scores with TouchDown (5 or 7 points), Field Goal (3 points), or eliminated opponents (2 points).<br/><br/>F) Style of Play.<br/>Special cards are provided with the game : they allow to customize the style of play for your team : Pass play, Run play, Aggressive Play, Tactical Play, Polyvalent play, Mixed play.<br/><br/>G) Edited february 18, 2016.

As you choose where to deploy your your defenses, Caesar and his generals begin a slow buy inexorable march from Rome, taking city by city until nothing is left. Do you race to the front?

Players' mecha retain momentum from previous turns' acceleration, and half the challenge is to stay in the arena while being buffeted by cannon fire and homing missiles.<br/><br/>The use of small control boards means that unlike many dexterity games, MAJESTY doesn't require a large, flat and smooth surface upon which to play.<br/><br/>"}, "172894": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2439974.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"180366": {"name": "Great War at Sea: Central Powers"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1269": {"name": "Michael Bennighof"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"1269": "Michael Bennighof"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"142": {"name": "Avalanche Press Ltd."}}, "maxplaytime": "300", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2439974_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:<br/><br/>In December 1912, Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy renewed their 30-year-old military pact known as the Triple Alliance. In the months that followed, staff officers from all three fleets prepared detailed plans for operations against the French and British fleets in the Mediterranean in case of war. Yet when war came in August 1914, Italy refused to join her Alliance partners and those plans would never be used.<br/><br/>What if Italy had honored her Alliance obligations, and joined the Germans and Austrians in a naval war against Britain and France? What if the Triple Alliance plans had been put into operation, with the Austrian and Italian fleets combining to challenge the French and British? The Great War at Sea in the Mediterranean is no longer confined to the Adriatic Sea, but now rages across the entire Mediterranean basin.<br/><br/>Triple Alliance is a book supplement for the Great War at Sea series based on those plans. It is not a complete game; ownership of Mediterranean and Dreadnoughts (and only Mediterranean and Dreadnoughts) is required to enjoy all of the scenarios.<br/><br/>The book includes 90 new scorchless, sootless laser-cut playing pieces. There are several versions of the Austrian battleship Radetzky, both the small dreadnought and full dreadnought variations presented by her design team in 1907. The all-big-gun battleship originally proposed for the Italian Navy by designer Vittorio Cuniberti is included, along with other ships cancelled for financial reasons. And the French receive a full class of unusual battleships proposed but never built, that carry the big guns of a dreadnought but also the not-quite-as-big guns of a semi-dreadnought.<br/><br/>And there are some pieces to replace armored cruisers and semi-dreadnoughts from our Mediterranean game, with gunnery ratings more accurately reflecting their capabilities. Plus new seaplane pieces rated for use with the aircraft rules that began to appear in Great War at Sea games after publication of the most recent edition of Mediterranean.<br/><br/>The thirty scenarios study the Triple Alliance war plan in a story all their own, following the outbreak of war and the conduct of operations as the joint planning staff foresaw possible events. The scenarios follow a single story arc, but also present a study of the Triple Alliance&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses. It&rsquo;s a similar approach to that in High Seas Fleet, but with its own story line.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"265771": "First edition"}, "average": "7.38182", "name": "Great War at Sea: Triple Alliance", "playingtime": "300", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "11", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"46": "Great War at Sea"}}, "172896": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2401802.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"197537": {"name": "Don't Turn Your Back: Don't Be a Wick \u2013 International Tabletop Day 2016 Promo"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"11251": {"name": "Eric B.

You can think of the material presented in this series as similar to the first wave of the fifth edition playtest. These game mechanics are in draft form, usable in your campaign but not fully tempered by playtests and design iterations. They are highly volatile and might be unstable; if you use them, be ready to rule on any issues that come up. They&rsquo;re written in pencil, not ink.<br/><br/>The material presented in Unearthed Arcana will range from mechanics that we expect one day to publish in a supplement to house rules from our home campaigns that we want to share, from core system options such as mass combat to setting-specific material such as the Eberron update included in this article. Once it's out there, you can expect us to check in with you to see how it's working out and what we can do to improve it.<br/><br/>Eberron Update. This month's installment is relatively straightforward. We're rolling out some rules to help you convert your Eberron campaign to fifth edition. The Eberron campaign setting was created by Keith Baker and first published for D&amp;D in 2004. It combines pulp adventure and intrigue in a world where magic-driven technology has produced airships, trains, and similar advancements comparable to early 20th-century Europe. The continent of Khorvaire, the center of Eberron's focus, has recently emerged from the Last War, a terrible conflict that saw the kingdom of Cyre transformed into a lifeless gray wasteland called the Mournland. That catastrophe shocked the remaining kingdoms into an uneasy peace that has held so far.<br/><br/>Full details on the Eberron setting are available in several PDF products available through dndclassics.com.

Well your party ends here tonight&rdquo; [Thugs draw their switchblades and holdout pistols]<br/><br/>Take the fight to the back alleys of the city with our latest freebie! The environment is filled with debris that can be used as improvised weapons or shields. A martial artist might take advantage of the planks and pipes as weapons or toss boxes as feints. A tough guy might throw steel drums, tires, or even the TV or use the steel locker as a shield. A strong super hero might even throw the couch!<br/><br/>Back Alley is a single page map of a debris filled alleyway lot.<br/><br/>Back Alley is intended for use in modern, pulp adventure, post-apocalyptic, or super hero games.<br/><br/>Adventure Hook for use with this map:<br/><br/>Mysterious Donations: A local fraternity, Delta Epsilon Omicron, has stumbled upon a new party drug that a nerdy pledge cooked up for them. They have started selling it in a nearby back street alley behind the frat house. They are trying to make enough money to have the biggest frat party ever and become campus legends. The cash they make is being funneled to the frat house by &ldquo;anonymous&rdquo; donors. A local gang of drug dealers have taken notice of their recent drug sales and are not happy about them taking money out of their pockets.<br/><br/>The drug dealers have contacted the frat posing as college kids and set up a meeting to buy drugs from them tonight. The gang is actually going to wax them to get rid of the competition instead.<br/><br/>The Player Characters can be detectives or police officers who have become aware of the drug sales and are staking out the area that night in a sting operation to observe the sale and bust the frat boys and drug dealers. When the thugs come in to buy drugs and they start firing instead, they have to leap into action to save the frat kids if they can.<br/><br/>One twist is that the drug is actual a revenge cooked up by the nerdy pledge tired of hazing and bullying. Those who use the drug are driven to euphoria, but over time the drug starts to physically change its users into ugly monsters with each new dose. The frat boys turn into abominations in this case and rip the thugs apart. The Player Characters rush to save them, only to find themselves going up against hideous, muscle-bound creatures that barely react to pain despite bullet holes in them from the thugs. Another twist is that the Player Characters are actually super heroes who use the detective or police officer occupations as masks for their real identities and can fight this threat directly.<br/><br/>"}, "172911": {"rpgitemversion": {"265801": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Hellspike", "rpgproducer": {"61588": "Joseph P.

It was due to this lack of intelligence about the Soviet&rsquo;s intentions and movements that the division&rsquo;s reconnaissance battalion, along with some sympathetic Cossacks, was sent out from Elista on September 13th. The unit&rsquo;s four day raid took them 90 miles beyond the Axis occupied village to the outskirts of Astrakhan during which they destroyed a fuel train, gathered intelligence about the nature of the Soviet&rsquo;s forces, and set off alarms in the region that sent STAVKA scrambling to deal with the threat.<br/><br/>Greyhound vs. Bear portrays the German raid and Soviet response in a quick playing and easy to learn mini-game.

For example, 1 card could provide a 'Stylish' attack while 2 could provide a 'Stylish' and 'Deceptive' attack.  Draw as many cards as you like and use action words provided to enhance your description.<br/><br/>Finally, each action word contains two descriptions to serve as examples.

Each hero has five cards at the start of the game, with an additional thirteen upgraded versions from which to choose when your hero gains a level. Each card is unique and can be used for a variety of different actions. The character roles are not preset and can evolve on the battlefield to better suit your strategy and counter the opponent's choices. There are no dice to roll, but playing the right card at the right moment is crucial.<br/><br/>The game begins with players placing their heroes and minions at predefined spots of the game board. The game is split into rounds, with each round consisting of up to four turns. Every player gets to play one card and resolve one action each turn. The cards are played face down, then revealed and resolved in order of initiative values indicated on the cards.<br/><br/>If at any point a team loses all of their minions in the area, the lane is &quot;pushed&quot;, with all minions on the board moving one area closer to the opponent's base.

These moustachioed men of science face not only stiff competition from their fellow explorers as they dive (only one man can take credit for discovering each species, after all, and science waits for no one) but also the multitudinous natural dangers and perilous creatures that lurk in the briny deeps.<br/><br/>As you explore the beautiful hex-based ocean you'll uncover aquatic species ripe for the cataloguing, environmental events both fair and foul, and underhanded shenanigans the unscrupulous can use to tip the balance in their favour (the scallywags!).<br/><br/>How to Play:<br/><br/>In All Fathomed Out, the goal is to amass the most impressive collection of previously unknown aquatic species as you possibly can before your competitors beat you to it.  You'd best hurry though, for only the first specimen of a given species is worth academic accolades and can be catalogued; the rest are old news best used for bait!<br/><br/>Each turn you move across the ocean floor, flipping over new tiles as you venture forth into the unknown or hustling over previously mapped areas on your way back to the ship to drop off your catch or in search of better hunting grounds.  Be careful about wandering too far, though, as the air hose connecting you to the ship and all that sweet, sweet oxygen is only so long and it'd be a real shame if the ship got hit by a sudden typhoon and was sent careening away...<br/><br/>Exploring a new tile nets you a number of cards (listed on the tile itself) from the game's four decks that could be the specimens you're looking to collect, environmental events that shake the game up, or shenanigans that you can use against other players (or keep for later).  You've only got so much space, though, so at the end of your turn you can only keep two cards.   Choose carefully!<br/><br/>Once one player catalogues five fish or the ocean is completely explored, the game is over and the player with the most impressive haul (determined by adding together the publication points from each specimen they have catalogued) wins!<br/><br/>"}, "172977": {"boardgamedesigner": {"6771": {"name": "Jim Wilkinson"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Movie Time!", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "2002", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2407446_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"29185": {"name": "Screenplay Games, Inc."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2407446.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"265892": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1064": {"name": "Movies / TV / Radio theme"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "&quot;The game of great lines from great movies!
