Struggling endlessly to sate a yearning that can&rsquo;t be fulfilled, the Clinging Shade becomes obsessed with an individual among the living.<br/><br/>Once a person has been chosen as the object of its demented obsessions, the Clinging Shade will relentlessly pursue them. Oftentimes, months will pass before it ever reveals itself. As time presses on however, the Shade will only grow bolder and its actions more extreme.<br/><br/>"}, "216082": {"rpgartist": ["Thomas Fayen", "Larry Selman"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "OWB: Allied Missions I", "rpgdesigner": ["Peter C.

Each body at your feet and every turn around the arena is another vote in your pocket. Get rid of the opposing Presidents by killing them, corrupting them, or having them dragged away kicking and screaming. Survive the carnage by dodging, bribing, and making treaties with your opponents. Your own President may be lost in the fight, but another will always rise up to take their place.<br/><br/>Presidential Knife Fight brings long-dead Presidents back to life for ruthless combat and historical satire in a card game for 3-6 players. The first 43 Presidents- George Washington through George W. Bush, are all represented in card form, each with a unique ability based on their time in office.<br/><br/>Each player begins the game with 3 President cards and gets to choose which order to play them. Maybe George Washington to go first, then Bill Clinton to escape every danger, and clean up with Teddy Roosevelt, the unstoppable killing machine. Gain votes by killing opposing Presidents, surviving a full turn around the table, or through special abilities. Get 5 votes to win the game and become Supreme President of These United States!<br/><br/>Each turn, a player gets 3 actions which they can spend on stabbing their enemies, drawing cards, playing cards, or using their presidential ability; allowing them to build their turn as offensively or defensively as they'd like. Presidents can die from wounds or be thrown out of office from corruption, but dead players re-enter the fight with a new President at the start of their next turn, ensuring no one is out for too long. Players use a shared deck of Action cards, filled with Attacks to kill your enemies, Reactions to keep you alive, and Executive Actions to change up the game. Steal someone's cards with the Patriot Act, have your Scapegoat take the fall for you, or rig the re-election to make sure you never lose!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "13", "name": "Presidential Knife Fight", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Take That", "Variable Player Powers"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games"]}, "216118": {"average": "7", "poll": [], "videogamebg": ["Pok\u00e9mon X and Y"], "name": "Pok\u00e9mon TCG: XY", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Deck / Pool Building"], "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1946738_t.jpg", "boardgameintegration": ["Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game", "Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Wizards of the Coast"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1946738.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "In this theme deck box you will find: 60-card deck, 1 card checklist, 1 metallic coin, 2-player playmat and rulesheet, 1 code card to play the deck online, 1 deckbox and damage counters.<br/><br/>"}, "216119": {"average": "0", "poll": [], "videogamebg": ["Pok\u00e9mon Black and White"], "name": "Pok\u00e9mon TCG: Black & White", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Deck / Pool Building"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic965357_t.jpg", "boardgameintegration": ["Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game", "Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Wizards of the Coast"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic965357.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "This theme deck Includes:<br/>1 60 card Pokemon deck<br/>1 metallic coin<br/>1 rulebook/card list<br/>1 playmat<br/>1 sheet of damage counters<br/>1 Deck box<br/><br/>"}, "216120": {"average": "7.5", "poll": [], "videogamebg": ["Pokemon Sun and Moon"], "name": "Pok\u00e9mon TCG: Sun & Moon Theme Deck", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Deck / Pool Building"], "yearpublished": "2017", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameintegration": ["Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game", "Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Wizards of the Coast"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "This theme deck Includes:<br/>1 60 card Pokemon deck<br/>1 metallic coin<br/>1 rulebook/card list<br/>1 playmat<br/>1 sheet of damage counters<br/>1 Deck box<br/><br/>Each deck includes a GX card of a final evolution of the Alola Starter Pokemon.<br/><br/>"}, "216121": {"average": "0", "poll": [], "videogamebg": ["Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver"], "name": "Pok\u00e9mon TCG: HeartGold & SoulSilver", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Deck / Pool Building"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic670485_t.jpg", "boardgameintegration": ["Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game", "Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Wizards of the Coast"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic670485.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "This theme deck Includes:<br/>1 60 card Pokemon deck<br/>1 metallic coin<br/>1 rulebook/card list<br/>1 playmat<br/>1 sheet of damage counters<br/>1 Deck box<br/><br/>"}, "216122": {"rpgdesigner": ["Adrian Gawaine Jones", "Jeff Mason", "Vince Pye", "David Underwood", "Ken Walton", "Holly Wreath"], "statistics": [], "name": "Rolling Thunder (Issue 3 - Holiday Special 2016)", "rpgartist": ["Bradley McDevitt"], "rpgproducer": ["David Underwood"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3303062.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Rolling Thunder"], "rpg": ["OneDice"], "rpgpublisher": ["Cakebread & Walton"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3303062_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>All new, fan-written material (with a seasonal flavour) for Cakbread &amp;

The game is about achieving a common goal together with an alliance while reviewing and discussing the 17 Success Principles written by Dr. Napoleon Hill (author of the classic book Think and Grow Rich). When the alliance collects more than 2,000 PMA (Positive Mental Attitude) points together they win the game by accomplishing the highest achievement level. If a player in the alliance loses all of his or her 11 Opportunity Time Tokens the game ends for the alliance. As a result, the players compare their alliance&rsquo;s PMA (Positive Mental Attitude) point total with a range of achievement levels.<br/><br/>This Achievus board game base set includes two games in one, &ldquo;Achievus Junior&rdquo; A.K.A. &ldquo;Achievus Mind-Set&rdquo; (2 to 4 players, Ages 7+) and &ldquo;Achievus Original&rdquo; A.K.A. &ldquo;Achievus Challenge&rdquo; (1 to 4 players, Ages 14+). Achievus game includes 112 Cards, 4 Conscious/Subconscious Mind Boards, 4 Golden Rule Applied Tokens, 60 PMA Point Tokens, 44 Opportunity Time Tokens, 2 Token Bags, and the rules for both original and junior game variations.<br/><br/>Achievus Junior &ndash; Game Play Overview<br/><br/>While playing Achievus Junior each player takes a turn in clockwise order to complete a round of play. A player takes his or her turn by following these 5 steps;<br/><br/>Step 1) Draw Step - Draw up to 6 cards, if needed.<br/>Step 2) Call Step - Call out a card to a player for a possible match.<br/>Step 3) Give &amp; Take Step - Give and Take a card with a player.<br/>Step 4) Play Step - May play down any needed pairs for the player&rsquo;s collection of the 17 principles,<br/>Step 5) Redraw Step - Redraw up to 6 cards.<br/><br/>If the players don&rsquo;t have a match during Step 2 then the calling player will lose one of his 11 Opportunity Time Tokens. When it&rsquo;s a match both players add the needed principle card to his or her collection of 17 principle cards. Then they read the principle meaning from the card aloud and discuss it with their alliance. The goal of Achievus Junior is for each player to help one another to collect a card of all 17 principles, without losing all of his or her Opportunity Time Tokens. Only then will the players earn the Golden Rule Applied Tokens, the ultimate achievement of the game.<br/><br/>Achievus Original &ndash; Game Play Overview<br/><br/>While Playing Achievus Original, players will experience prosperity and adversity events throughout the game, earning PMA points and Action Stars. All players&rsquo; follow these 6 consecutive steps together, each step before the next, to complete a round of play.<br/><br/>Step 1) Draw Step - Each player draws five cards, resolving any adversity or prosperity events.<br/>Step 2) Sacrifice Step - Each player may or may not choose to sacrifice his turn, discarding his cards and losing only one Opportunity Time Token this way.<br/>Step 3) Collect Step - Each player may choose to collect the cards they have previously played in their Conscious Mind Section to earn PMA points and Action Stars or may choose to continue gathering without collecting at this time. <br/>Step 4) Play Step - Each player plays his or her cards in consecutive order in any players&rsquo; Conscious Mind Section, earning PMA points for giving.<br/>Step 5) Missed Opportunity Step - Each player loses one of his or her 11 Opportunity Time Tokens for each principle card not played then discards them.<br/>Step 6) Read Step &ndash; Read the top discarded principle card. Players then share aloud how they have applied this principle in his or her life with their alliance.<br/><br/>The goal of Achievus Original is to strategize among the alliance to make the best possible plays. Players need to prepare for Adversity Events that may take away the Principle Cards in a player&rsquo;s Conscious Mind Section. Players work together to gather all 17 Principle Cards in one player&rsquo;s Conscious Mind Section. When this is accomplished, that player collects the cards (During Step 3) which includes all 17 principle cards. Only then will the players earn the Golden Rule Applied Tokens, the ultimate achievement of the game.<br/><br/>"}, "216139": {"poll": [], "name": "NIVA", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3304169.png", "videogametheme": ["Animals", "Art"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Walking Simulator"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3304169_t.png", "description": "NIVA is a pacifistic exploration art game.<br/><br/>The player slips into the role of a mighty forest god to restore the harmony in a mesmerizing forest and relieve it of a mysterious infestation.

But sometimes, it can be fun to take on the mantle of the otherworldly, and to embrace the alien terrors of the cosmos. Each installment of Weekly Wonders: Eldritch Archetypes contains five archetypes for eldritch characters&mdash;those that are weird, alien, and otherworldly, who don&rsquo;t fit in with normal society&mdash;as well as a cleric domain devoted to a specific mythos entity or race.<br/><br/>For this book, we focus on the Great Race of Yith, or the Yithians, a species of strange and alien creatures that possess the power to cast their minds through time and space to inhabit the bodies of other creatures. Introduced in The Shadow Out of Time by H.P. Lovecraft, the original physical features of this race are unknown, but they are often depicted in the bodies of a host-race of conical aliens with long necks and crab-like claws. The Great Race is said to gather knowledge from the past and present, and to cast their minds about to different places and times, perhaps to influence the course of history. Whether or not they mention the Great Race directly, each archetype on this book builds upon the powers and themes of the great race, casting their minds into other bodies, and peering forward and backward in time. This book contains the following archetypes:<br/><br/>    The seeker out of time, an investigator archetype that focuses on divination magic and can share experience others&rsquo; memories.<br/>    The channeler of the Great Race, a medium archetype who channels the minds of Yithians rather than traditional spirits.<br/>    The transcendent one, a monk archetype from an order devoted to combating the Yithians and their ilk, trained to defend against mental attacks and possessed of supernatural foresight.<br/>    The ally of Yith, a vigilante archetype whose vigilante identity is actually the mind of a Yithian that works in tandem with the vigilante to accomplish inscrutable ends.<br/>    The temporal master, a wizard archetype that can bend time to prepare exactly the spells he needs, consult his future self, and even cast his mind backwards or forwards through time.<br/>    A bonus cleric domain devoted to those who worship the Great Race.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "216194": {"poll": [], "name": "Satellite Command", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iOS edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Physics", "Space"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Stormtide Limited"], "videogamegenre": ["Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["iPad", "iPhone"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Stormtide Limited"], "description": "Satellite Command is a realistic astrophysics simulator.

On Saturday nights, the factory comes to life as the ultimate race course with treacherous obstacles and rival sabotage. In Robo Rally, players move their robots through the course by speeding through corridors and dodging traps to reach each checkpoint first. Only the strongest robots survive!<br/><br/>Enter the world of mad machines and dangerous schemes in the Robo Rally board game. Players control their robot with game cards which reveal directions on how the robots can move through the hectic Robo Rally automobile factory. Use strategy to outsmart rival robots while racing towards each checkpoint in your chosen course in numerical order. Beware of factory obstacles such as industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyer belts that can make or break the race.<br/><br/>The 2016 edition of Robo Rally differs from earlier versions in a number of ways:<br/><br/><br/>    Players each now have their own deck of twenty cards, with the same cards in each deck. On a turn, a player draws nine cards from their deck, programs five of the cards, then discards the rest. Two cards says &quot;Again&quot; and repeat the action programmed in the previous slot; one card says &quot;Energy&quot; and gives a energy cube which you can use to buy options.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Since each player has their own deck, the cards no longer have priority numbers to determine who moves first. Now movement order is determined by whoever is closest to a transmitter on the game board.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Players start with a hand of three option cards and five energy. Each option card has an energy cost, and you can purchase additional option cards for the cost of two energy each. Players can earn energy by programming it, by being the first to a pitstop, or by starting their turn on a pitstop.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    When players are damaged, they no longer receive one less card for each damage (or have one of their program registers locked) at the start of a round; instead they receive damage cards that will be shuffled into their decks. &quot;Normal&quot; damage from the board or a robot laser gives you &quot;spam&quot; damage. When you program one of these cards, you remove it from play at the appropriate time and replace it in the register with the top card from your deck. Surprise! Other types of damage exist, with a Trojan horse granting you two spam, a virus infecting nearby players, and a worm forcing you to reboot, which gives you even more damage. By playing the damage, though, you remove it from your deck.<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "German first edition"], "average": "7.46995", "name": "Robo Rally (2016)", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Grid Movement", "Modular Board", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "382", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Robots"]}, "216202": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Joseph S.

Jan. 1: The opening of the Paris Peace Conference is imminent, but unrest and violence are already spreading throughout Germany and Italy as well as in many other European countries. Communist forces are marching to power, following the example of the Bolsheviks in Russia. The murder of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Libknecht is still a possibility. Will the German Social-Democracy make an evil pact with the proto-Nazi Freikorps to eliminate the two revolutionary leaders from the political theatre? Extreme left and right parties face each other creating disorder and putting the Social-Democratic and Liberal governments under pressure to bring peace to Europe. Democratic forces have about fifteen years to save the Old Continent from the maelstrom of tyranny and totalitarianism. Will they fail as happened in history? The economic crisis of middle classes, the loss of monetary power and wealth, hyperinflation, the never-ending clash with the proletarian forces and the Great Depression ... will all such factors bring the liberal European countries to the verge of bankruptcy? Or will Mussolini and Hitler be left out of the history books?<br/><br/>Rise of Totalitarianism is an interactive simulation enabling you to explore all such questions. A card-driven strategy game, it reproduces the ideological conflicts and political struggles that led to the establishment of totalitarian dictatorships in Europe throughout the 1920s and 1930s. The game covers the period 1919-1933 and is designed for three players. Each takes the role of one of the three Ideologies &ndash; Social-Democracy, Fascism and Communism &ndash; that struggled for power during the timeline of the game.<br/><br/>Rise of Totalitarianism offers an accurate and detailed historical context, supported by 90 game cards. Players exploit historical events and political actions to achieve political supremacy and must face the major crises that upset the European countries of the era. Game cards provide political points that are used by players to plan secret actions on the map by using action chits. Action chits are revealed simultaneously and players can then perform their reactions and activities (propaganda, conflicts, laws and reforms) to influence society, public opinion, political orientation, the economy and the stability of governments.&quot;<br/><br/>Some more details on the game-play:<br/><br/>GOAL OF THE GAME &ndash; In Rise of Totalitarianism each player takes the role of an Ideology (Communism, Fascism or Social-Democracy) and has the goal of controlling, for as long as possible, the Governments of the Major Powers represented in the game (Germany and Italy) and of as many Minor Nations as possible (Austria, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Yugoslavia). Players earn Victory Points (VP) mostly through the control of the Governments of Major Powers and Minor Nations.<br/>To achieve control of Minor Nations, players try to influence the political allegiance of such countries, or they attempt to destabilize and overthrow their Governments. In both cases players are aiming for the same goal: to draw the ideological orientation of the Governments into their sphere of influence.<br/>To achieve control of Major Powers, on the other hand, players must use deeper and more complex mechanisms. One Ideology controls the Government of each Major Power at any time, with the other two Ideologies working in the background to influence public opinion and destabilize the Government. This causes the Government to fall and force new Elections, which are then won by the Ideology thanks to the shift of mass support towards it. In addition, Social-Democracy has the task of preserving Democracy by ensuring that the Governments are always determined by Elections. Fascism and Communism, in contrast, must attempt to put a totalitarian Regime in power &ndash; each Ideology has its own means and mechanism for doing this. Putting a Regime into power means that Elections will no longer take place in the nation &ndash; thus keeping the Government in power forever &ndash; unless the economic conditions and the stability of the country become so bad that the Regime is overthrown and new Elections can take place.<br/><br/>GAME-PLAY FUNDAMENTALS &ndash; All activities performed by players (Actions) to pursue their goals in Major Powers and Minor Nations are planned secretly by using Action chits. But planning these Actions is costly. Players pay these costs both by expending the Political Points (PP) provided by Game Cards (see below) and by using cubes, which represent the Funding granted to their Ideologies by bankers, industrialists, agrarians, foreign states, or more simply the political support of bureaucrats and institutions. Funding fluctuates with the fortunes and disgraces of the major political parties represented by the Ideologies, but also with the wealth of nations where these parties operate. Furthermore, Actions can be supported by Leaders, which represent the politicians and statesmen that historically emerged in the period and that are present in the game. Each Leader provides a bonus to the effectiveness of the Action he or she is tasked to accomplish. Such effectiveness is measured by Action Points (AP), that enable the Primary Goal of the Action and a set of additional Bonus Operations to be performed.<br/><br/>GAME CARDS &ndash; Game cards are a core element of the game-play. There are three types:<br/><br/>1. Crisis Cards represent the most important historical events that generated troubles &ndash; or opportunities &ndash; during the timeline covered by the game. These cards trigger the Crises that must be resolved by players.<br/><br/>2. Strategy Cards are at the same time the engine and the fuel of players' operations. Each Ideology has its own Strategy Cards Deck. Strategy Cards provide the Political Points (PP) used by players to plan Actions, but they also enrich the game-play with Events, Political Actions, Laws and further Crises. Events are cards whose effects are applied immediately after the card is played. Political Actions are endeavors performed by players using a card whose effects are applied only after a successful Political Action Attempt (die roll with various modifiers). Laws are cards whose effects cause a permanent change in the game rules. Laws come into effect only after a specific player's Action has been planned and successfully performed, i.e. the Law is &quot;promulgated&quot;.<br/><br/>3. Coup Cards form an additional deck that is used to simulate a sort of &quot;domino effect&quot; throughout Minor Nations when a minor country's Government is overthrown. These cards add further Crises and Events.<br/>Political Points (PP) are also provided by Crisis Cards and Coup Cards.<br/><br/>SEQUENCE OF PLAY &ndash; The game is played in Turns, each Turn representing a period of time spanning from one to four years. Every Turn is played according to a strict procedure called the Sequence of Play, which is divided into four Phases:<br/><br/>1. Players must first determine their Funding. The Funding allows players to choose their position in the Order of Play, which determines the order in which Actions and Reactions are performed.<br/><br/>2. During the Card Phase, players refill their hand of cards, and reshuffle and add new cards to the decks if required by the Turn.<br/><br/>3. The Political Phase is resolved in one to three Rounds, depending on the length of the Turn (usually the number of years). During each Round, a Crisis Card is drawn and resolved, players secretly choose and then simultaneously reveal Strategy Cards, apply their effects, plan and resolve Actions and carry out Reactions. At the end of each Round, a Crisis check is performed to verify the outcomes of every Active Crisis.<br/><br/>4. The Cleanup Phase ends the Turn. Besides the normal end-Turn management activities, during this Phase players must check the Economy of Major Powers and the Stability of Minor Nations and Major Powers. A good Economy (growth, profits, foreign capitals) or a bad Economy (economic crises, depression, debts, war reparations) will, respectively, improve or worsen the Stability of Major Powers.<br/>If a Stability Check fails in a Major Power, Elections must take place to decide on a new Government Coalition in the Major Power. If a Regime rules the Major Power, the Stability check can fail only if the Economy is in the worst condition possible.<br/>If a Stability Check fails in a Minor Nation, the Government is overthrown and the political allegiance of the Minor Nation shifts towards the Ideology that contributed most to the change of the ideological orientation of the Government.<br/><br/>"}, "216222": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Stefan Risthaus"], "average": "6.1", "poll": [], "name": "Tallinn: 5 and 6 Players Expansion", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "5", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "yearpublished": "2016", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamefamily": ["Cities: Tallinn", "Country: Estonia"], "boardgameartist": ["Christian Fiore"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["OSTIA Spiele"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Medieval"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "This is the 5 and 6 players expansion for the card game for 2-4 players.

The boat must avoid colliding with various hazards in the river - these include small islands, crocodiles and logs. The aim is to rescue explorers lost in the jungle.<br/><br/>The boat periodically passes a pair of docks arranged across from each other on either side of the river. If the boat moves to the upper dock, and explorer will run out of the jungle onto the boat. Stopping at the lower dock causes any explorers already on the ship walk back off to safety. Because of the scrolling motion, it is not possible to land at both docks in one go, you must pick up an explorer and then continue along the river until the dock reappears.<br/><br/>Depending on the version and level, between three and five explorers have to be rescued to complete a round.

It is also available for download via Wargame Vault for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>It is based on one of the early battles of the Thirty Years War, the Battle of White Mountain. One sheet of rules and one mapsheet is provided; you'll need to provide twelve dice and 50 tokens, coins, or cubes.<br/><br/>Each player has a pool of dice that he rolls each turn, and then he commits dice to a particular unit's box, according to the type and number of dice that can be placed in that box. For example, the Bohemian Right and his opponent's Catholic League Infantry both use sixes, but the latter can gain at most one die per turn. It's not that the Bohemians are more ferocious or better-led (they're not!), but rather that they are fighting (albeit poorly) from a strong defensive position, while mounting an attack on that position takes time and preparation. When a unit is activated, all the stored dice are removed, and losses are inflicted on the enemy depending on the number of dice.<br/><br/>Or not; one of the signal features of this particular design is the ability of cavalry and artillery to screen and discourage enemy attacks. If I have the right number of dice in my cavalry box when you attack an infantry unit under that cavalry's protection, I can expend those dice to cancel your attack. In fact, it's not just that I can do it, but that I'm required to, and so both the attacking unit and the screening unit have their dice cleared out. When I perform that Reaction, it robs me of the ability to make an Attack on my own turn immediately following. This means that there's a definite cat-and-mouse feel, with each side struggling for control of tempo. You don't want to just prevent your enemy from attacking, you also want to get the leverage you need to launch a successful attack yourself. You want to set up your cavalry so as to screen effectively, but if that's all you're doing, you won't have sufficient dice to press your advantage when it appears.<br/><br/>In general, the Imperial/Catholic League position is a more flexible one, representative of the superiority of their commanders and the bifurcated command structure. Not only may they place in two boxes per turn (one per army), but between them there's at least one box that can potentially utilize each die result. The Bohemian Player on the other hand places in only one box per turn, and any ones, twos, or threes are absolutely worthless. Because of his defensive position, he can place more dice for his infantry divisions - if you roll three sixes, you can place three sixes, while the enemy infantry places at most one at a time.<br/><br/>So, each side has its strengths and weaknesses, and while your decisions are driven by your dice, they are still meaningful decisions. The game typically plays out in less than thirty minutes, with the exact time depending on the aggressiveness of the players.<br/><br/>"}, "216301": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Inka Brand", "Markus Brand"], "poll": [], "name": "Scotland Yard: Das Kartenspiel", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "usersrated": "17", "yearpublished": "2017", "boardgameimplementation": ["Scotland Yard"], "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3326508_t.jpg", "average": "5.55882", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3326508.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["German first edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Deduction", "Murder/Mystery"], "age": "9", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Welcome back to London where the champions of Scotland Yard are once again on the hunt for the invisible Mister X!<br/><br/>At the beginning of Scotland Yard: Das Kartenspiel, an implementation of the evergreen title Scotland Yard, the Mister X card is randomly distributed to one of the players.

(Destination: Treasure Island) is formally a race game, but in fact you need to employ tactics to meet challenges, complete missions and earn victory points. Your decisions will largely influence your score, although elements of luck are also present in the game.<br/><br/>2-4 pirate ships set to sea to reach Treasure Island ahead of the others. But being the first is not enough: the real winner will be the one who scores best in the various challenges on the way. <br/>The pirates (48 character cards) have certain skills of different strength which can be boosted by using the appropriate weapons and tools (24 weapon cards). The set of cards held by players in hand continuously changes as cards are played and replaced during actions. This determines the actual power of a player&rsquo;s crew when facing a particular challenge.  Playing the cards tactfully can earn considerable advantage and valuable treasures for players, which will improve their final score.<br/><br/>The game starts with an empty board and a series of blank fields on the sea, leading to Treasure Island. As the ships move ahead, the board is gradually filled with event cards randomly drawn, all indicating an action. Players will gather and sell pearls, trade with weapons, spy out and occupy islands, collect treasures, complete various missions or even kidnap other&rsquo;s sailors.  Often they master their skills to compete against each other or fight the forces of nature.<br/><br/>The winner will be the player who achieves the most victory points by sailing fast, completing missions and having a valuable collection of treasures.<br/><br/>Description from the publisher:<br/>Ir&aacute;ny a Kincses Sziget!<br/>Verseng&eacute;s &eacute;s k&uuml;zdelem a tengeren<br/><br/>Az Ir&aacute;ny a Kincses sziget! formailag egy versenyj&aacute;t&eacute;k, de a gy\u0151zelemhez j&oacute; taktik&aacute;ra &eacute;s n&eacute;mi szerencs&eacute;re is sz&uuml;ks&eacute;g van. <br/>N&eacute;h&aacute;ny kal&oacute;zhaj&oacute; nagy zs&aacute;km&aacute;ny rem&eacute;ny&eacute;ben nekiv&aacute;g a tengernek, hogy a t&ouml;bbiek el\u0151tt &eacute;rjen el a Kincses szigetre.

Many attempts have been made to replace it with other systems, but there is a certain charm to Vancian magic that keeps bringing the game back to it, over and over again.<br/><br/>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that Vancian spellcasting couldn&rsquo;t use a fresh coat of paint, and maybe to learn a trick or two. This book pushes the boundaries of what magic can do in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. A collection of over 100 brand new, never-before-seen spells, it features several new mechanics that explore the value and utility of a spell slot, including:<br/><br/>    Bonded spells, which can be prepared in the same slot as another spell, allowing the caster to use either one.<br/>    Composite spells, which can be cast normally, or by expending multiple lower-level spell slots.<br/>    Divisible spells, which can have their effect divided up across multiple castings, allowing the caster to use just as much magical energy as the situation calls for.<br/>    Fountain spells, a fan favorite from past installments of Advanced Arcana, which allow you to regain a lost spell slot upon casting the spell.<br/>    Ritual spells, which blend the occult rituals of Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Occult Adventures with more traditional magic.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Beyond these, there are numerous spells of a more traditional nature, as well as several appendices containing new and exotic familiars, feats and magic items that interact with the new mechanics in the book, and even a section introducing the idea of miscast spells, versions of spells that have gone partially awry, but not enough so that they have no effect at all.<br/><br/>If you&rsquo;ve already experienced one of the previous installments of Advanced Arcana, you know that this book is not to be missed. And if you haven&rsquo;t, now is the perfect time to expand your magical horizons.

Starting in the second round, players may begin to use modifier cards, which can do anything from change the exercise, skip a player, increase the amount of repetitions, and even make other people perform additional exercises.<br/><br/>A player earns the number of points listed on the card for successfully completing a round. The first player to earn 40 points, wins.<br/><br/>In Bid War, players divide the repetition cards equally between them and draw 3 modifiers. Each round, an exercise card is drawn. Players then bid by using their rep cards. The highest bid gets to do the exercise for the number of reps they bid. In the case of multiple players bidding the same number, those players may all do the exercise or they can play an additional bid--that additional bid adds to the number of reps that they have already played. After the bidding, players may use modifiers to alter the workout. Players earn the points listed on the card for successfully performing the exercise. The player with the most points after all the rep cards are done, wins! In groups of 4 or more, it is acceptable to reshuffle and re-deal the rep cards once or twice in order to extend play.<br/><br/>CardFit brings friends and family together in a fun and competitive environment while enabling them to exercise at the same time.

We, however, want to show the story through the lens of the game and don't let the word &quot;game&quot; mislead you. This game does not claim to be a history lesson, but it shows the course of the war in all its seriousness through the major milestones, from the first days till the latest important victories over terror.<br/><br/>What kind of a game is it?<br/><br/><br/>    Syrian Warfare is a real time strategy with a high degree of realism. This game is not about a base construction or units production. The player will have to determine their forces characteristics before they go into action. And during the mission, they would be able to select reinforcements in order to support the troopers.<br/>    The troops and machinery crews move from mission to mission and gain experience, which helps them increase their effectiveness.<br/>    Trophies captured by the player on the battlefield can be used throughout the whole campaign.<br/>    Importantly enough, there are no &laquo;life bars&raquo; for vehicles in the game. Damages are calculated by taking into account the protection module and the power of adverse factors. Inflicted damages affect the functioning of the module.<br/>    In the battlefield, it is impossible to repair the armor, but one can repair the modules by using a limited stock of spare parts. Ammunition and fuel are also limited.<br/>    A system of high-quality physical demolition of buildings and other objects is used in the game (it does not only look spectacular, but it has a serious influence on the tactics during the missions, especially in urban areas).<br/>    The game has a wide set of tactical possibilities: The storming of buildings, usage of smokescreens, infantry lift by helicopters and APC/IFV, air strike calls, capturing of trophy weapons and equipment, usage of heat flares and active defense complexes.<br/>    And of course the story itself. We will try to show the conflict, not from a point of view of a general, located somewhere at the &lsquo;top&rsquo;.

At first all of us were excited, because a silly string store was opening in town, and Sour John&rsquo;s dad was handing out free samples to all the kids in the mall.  We had a blast!  But the spoiled brat &ldquo;Sour John&rdquo;, as we would later come to call him, wasn&rsquo;t satisfied.  He wanted to rule the entire mall, and eventually all of Little Worth.  Sour John was a child genius, and he soon opened his own weapon store, &ldquo;More Gore!&rdquo;, in the mall.  This is where he conducted his late night experiments to perfect a can of silly string that would be unbreakable, unending, AND impossible to resist.  One night he went to the fountain in the greenery section of the mall, &ldquo;Fount Bloom&rdquo;, and discovered that Fount Bloom&rsquo;s special mixture was exactly what was needed to craft his most diabolical creation &ndash; &ldquo;ONE STRING TO RULE THE MALL!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Fortunately for us all, he misplaced The One String before he was able to wield it.  It was found by a good kid, nick-named &ldquo;Seagull&rdquo;, but it quickly corrupted him.  He started using The One String as deodorant and calling it &ldquo;my freshness&rdquo;.  (Yeah, it was weird.)  Seagull took up with the wrong kids, the &ldquo;Redheads&rdquo;, and later changed his name to &ldquo;Gold Thumb&rdquo; (based on his newfound obsession with the James Bond movie &ldquo;Goldfinger&rdquo;).  But again, as fate would have it, &ldquo;Billy Bob&rdquo; Braggin found The One String in Gold Thumb&rsquo;s discarded lunchbox, and he kept it safe for a while.  Most recently he just gifted it to his younger cousin, &ldquo;Fro-Gro&rdquo; Braggin.  But Sour John has just discovered that the Braggin family is in possession of The One String. He has dispatched his scariest goons, the &ldquo;Nostrils&rdquo;, with robes and skateboards of black, to retrieve The One String and bring it back to &ldquo;More Gore!&rdquo;<br/><br/>The two groups of good kids in Little Worth Mall, &ldquo;Yellow Ship&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lean &amp; Green&rdquo;, have just held a secret meeting at &ldquo;Livin&rsquo; Well&rdquo;, a natural supplement store owned by &ldquo;Spell Wand&rsquo;s&rdquo; parents.  They have decided that Yellow Ship will undertake the dangerous task of taking The One String all the way (downstairs) to Fount Bloom, the only place where it can be dissolved forever.  Meanwhile, Lean &amp; Green will serve as a distraction to keep the Redheads and the Nostrils away from The One String.  Secrecy is of the utmost importance.  Each of them grabs their can of silly string and prepares for battle.<br/>The &ldquo;horde of the strings&rdquo; has been set loose in Little Worth Mall!

Numerous French efforts to dislodge them failed and the two great hosts stared at each other from their respective trenches. German General Erich von Falkenhayn and French Marshal Joseph Joffre realized that there was much open, exploitable territory to the north of these solidified lines and each prepared to maneuver around the flanks of his opponent. These mutual and simultaneous flanking moves resulted in a series of headlong battles that gradually shifted the forces north toward the French Channel coast. These maneuverings yielded a series of encounter battles at Picardy, Albert, Artois, La Bassee and along the Yser River. But these engagements were ultimately indecisive and the campaign&rsquo;s final stage was set for the dramatic clash at the end of the &ldquo;race&rdquo;, at the ancient textile city of Ypres. <br/>The &ldquo;Race to the Sea&rdquo; campaign was the last mobile campaign on the western front of the First World War &ndash; a last chance for victory. It was a final push to get &ldquo;home before the leaves fall&rdquo;. But the resulting murderous battles &ndash; culminating in the infamous &ldquo;Kindermord von Ypern&rdquo; (the Massacre of the Innocents at Ypres) &ndash; were so bloody and indecisive that their effects instead directly lead to the creation of the Western Front trench lines and to a continuation of a  war that seemed would never end.<br/><br/>The game system is based on the same system used in the game Dead Reckoning by Tiny Battle Publishing.

It was designed to be an add-on to Pyramid Arcade, but can be played with any Looney Pyramids and some six-sided dice.<br/><br/>RULES<br/><br/>The goal is to control three cities (circular spaces on board [but not including one's home city]) by arranging a stack of one's pyramids whose pip count is higher than every other players' stack (including dead ones) on that space.<br/><br/>SET UP: Each player gets three trios of pyramids, one color to a player, and pick which corner space to place their starting stack (called a spire, in tree formation) on. Spare pyramids are kept in a bank next to the player. Black pyramids are used to represent dead cities: unused spaces during set up and the remaining spires of players removed from the game. In a four-player game, the central space is a dead city (with its own spire). In two- and three-player games two opposing corners are dead cities.<br/><br/>PLAY: On one's turn roll the three dice and perform the three actions in any order. The options are: Transform: take a piece from one's spire and turn it into a sandship by placing it on its side in a city's port (triangular notch in circle); or, turn or add a sandship into a spire of yours in another city. Build: add a piece (using the smallest pieces first) to your home spire. Unfurl: replace a sandship with the next largest piece. Move: move a sandship to another port, either in the same city, or travel to a port of another city in the same zone. If there is already a sandship there of a smaller size it can be pushed to the next port in that city. Zap: remove a smaller piece from another player's spire using your sandship docked in that city. Wild: choose any of the other actions to perform. If you roll two-of-kind, one is treated as wild. If three-of-kind, two become wild with a bonus wild action. If an action cannot be performed treat the roll as wild.<br/><br/>If a player's home spire is completely zapped away all that player's sandships are removed and any of that person's spires in other cities are replaced with black pyramids.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "name": "Sandships", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "average": "6.58333", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "6", "boardgamefamily": ["Looney Pyramids"]}, "216363": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Frank Sronce"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "ManaSurge: Kickstarter Promos", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Take That"], "yearpublished": "2016", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgameartist": ["Zulkarnaen Hasan Basri"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Daily Magic Games"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy", "Number"], "age": "14", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Kickstarter backers for ManaSurge were awarded with 3 powerful exclusive backer cards.

Players each pick a character and customise them by choosing ability cards, relationships with the other characters, and cosmetic details (name, appearance, personality etc). Then the group drafts Goals and Assets for each character - these are the objectives they're trying to achieve, and the resources they have to try to do that.<br/><br/>Play then starts, with each player taking it in turn to play through a short scene of their character working towards their goal while the other characters help, interfere, or push their own agendas. Within scenes, characters can activate special abilities to do things like revealing an incredibly expensive possession, providing another character with a refreshing cocktail, or fixing someone with an imperious gaze that forces them to reveal their secrets. These are all paid for with a limited pool of tokens, meaning players must carefully plan when they use their abilities to guide the story in their preferred direction.<br/><br/>As characters make progress on their goals they accumulate special tokens they can cash in for an all-or-nothing attempt to complete the goal.

It covers the campaigns of spring and autumn 1800 that took place in Germany from the crossing of the Rhine to the banks of the Inn. General Moreau, whose successes would later be overshadowed by those of Napoleon in Italy and the improbable victory of Marengo, is at the heart of this initiative. In six months, he manages to force back Kray&rsquo;s and then the Archduke John&rsquo;s Austrians from France&rsquo;s doorstep to the confines of Bavaria with the culminating decisive battle at Hohenlinden.<br/>The three first scenarios describe Moreau&rsquo;s entrance into the campaign with the hazardous crossing of the Rhine, the gruelling march through the Black Forest, the concentration of the three army corps from Sainte Suzanne, Saint Cyr and the army reserve coinciding with the flank assault from Lecourbe&rsquo;s corps, the counterattack of the Austrians under Kray, and the undecided battles of Engen, Mol&szlig;kirch and Biberach. The French must demonstrate their resourcefulness as Napoleon grows impatient and demands reinforcements from Moreau to support his offensive in Italy. Time is running out; advance in the direction of Ulm before the order arrives for the troops to depart toward the south.<br/>The three scenarios that follow relate the events in Bavaria that lead up to the clash at Hohenlinden in deplorable weather. The Archduke John, propelled by his ardour, decides to assault the French at Munich while the latter marched toward them. This battle of encounter is decisive, contrary to the battles of the spring. With this victory, Moreau succeeds in bringing to an end this war with Austria.<br/>With this new volume, the series The Marshals continues to evolve. The experience of playing numerous games as well as the requests of fans of the series led to minor adaptations integrated into the general rules as well as the addition of new optional rules.

If a player can't play all of the cards in their hand, they risk dropping out of a heat early while their opponents continue to build lines.  Once all players have dropped out of the heat, each player scores points equal to the highest value line they've built in that heat.
