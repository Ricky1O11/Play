It features all the units, from Morgan's Rifles to the British grenadiers, and all the dense, wooded terrain you would normally expect, but in a way you've probably not seen before.<br/><br/>The game uses two decks of cards, one deck for each player to drive the game. Each player gets a certain number of his cards each turn, never his full deck, and his allotment is usually different (in terms of number and type) from his opponent. The cards are used to determine movement, combat, and special items, such as Indian Stealth, Counter-Attack, Rifle Fire, and Rapid Movement, among others. Players may play as many cards as they wish when it's their turn, using each card for only one of the possible three purposes. Play passes back and forth between players, until both players have used all their cards &hellip; and the Turn is over.<br/><br/>Turning Point is thus a game of card play and management, which unfolds on the map of Freeman's Farm, which uses squares, rather than hexes,. You're still moving units, trying to outflank, attacking with what you hope are better odds (since you don't know what cards your opponent will play, if any, and you never know what his final strength will be), and using your cards, and wits, to outplay your opponent.<br/><br/>Turning Point was a nominee in the Charles S.

The game is played on two boards: the challenge board and the score track.  By advancing a marker on the challenge board, you can score points on the score track.  The first player to reach the end of the score track wins.<br/><br/>The heart of the game is a &quot;push your luck&quot; dice mechanism to advance on the challenge board.  A player begins by rolling five dice, setting aside ones.  Other numbers can be used to advance a pawn along one of five columns, representing Looks, Faces, Tickles, Ouchies, and Teases.  After each roll, you can either stop or keep rolling.  If you stop and your pawn is the most advanced pawn in that column, then you remove any pawn it passed.  If it is not the most advanced, then you remove your pawn from the challenge board.  If your pawn has not been removed from the board by your next turn, then you score points for it on the score track.<br/><br/>You can keep rolling dice to advance your pawn farther up the challenge board, but when you accumulate three or more ones, your parents have caught you picking on your sibling.  Your turn ends and you lose points.<br/><br/>"}, "19526": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic121747.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Klaus Teuber"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2005", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Tanja Donner"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Catan GmbH", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Hobby World", "KOSMOS", "Mayfair Games", "Smart Ltd", "Tactic"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic121747_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Territory Building"], "boardgamehonor": ["2006 \u00c5rets Spill Best Family Game Nominee", "2006 Golden Geek Best Gamer's Board Game Nominee", "2006 Tric Trac Nominee"], "description": "This is the second game in the 'Abenteuer Catan' (Catan Adventures) series that started with Candamir: The First Settlers.

Each turn, the player rolls a pair of dice. That player will then choose 2 out of the 3 options to perform, and allocates one of the rolled dice to each of those options. The options are:<br/><br/>Option 1: The player turns tile face up from a face down stack, until the number of face up tiles matches the number on the chosen die.<br/><br/>Option 2: The player chooses the number of tiles indicated by the die, and adds those tiles to their existing maze.<br/><br/>Option 3: The player advances their pawn through their maze as many squares (there are 2 squares per tile) as the die indicates.<br/><br/>The tiles have various configurations of bold lines around certain edges, indicating walls of the maze. When the maze is completed, it must be fully enclosed by the border, and all squares must be reachable by the pawn.<br/><br/>The round ends when a player has completed their maze and has moved the pawn from the Start to the Finish, entering Finish with an exact die roll. Alternatively, a round can end when both players have run out of tiles, and one of them has reached the end of their incomplete maze. Scores are tallied using various factors (number of squares in the maze, number of squares needed to complete the maze, number of squares the pawn needs to travel to reach the Finish, number of squares on unused face up tiles), and low score wins the round.<br/><br/>Rules are also included for variants to adjust the difficulty of the game.<br/><br/>(C) The Game Works, Inc.  1983<br/><br/>"}, "19581": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Great Games Pty Ltd"], "poll": [], "name": "Crossword Challenge", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "3", "yearpublished": "1991", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic575805_t.jpg", "average": "3.05", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Holdsworth Thos & Sons"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic575805.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Puzzle"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From the box:<br/>Crossword Challenge gives you all the fun of a regular crossword as well as the chance to compete with your friends or family.

Formally played by women, today both men and women of all ages enjoy the excitement of C&eacute;exstem. The goal of the game is to see who can reach the agreed upon point total first. Any number of individuals can play at one time. The game is a wonderful way to learn the number system of the Nim&iacute;ipuu, counting from n&aacute;aqc (one) to le'dptit (twenty), and have a lot of fun doing so!<br/><br/>To play the game, you need two sets of game sticks, each set colored a different color, e.g., blue and red, and each set marked indicating a &aacute;ayet (male) and hamma (female), a &quot;couple.&quot; The male stick is often marked with an extra perpendicular line across it. The reverse side of a stick is called, caya, &quot;nothing.&quot;<br/><br/>Before starting the players agree upon the number of points to win, the higher the number, the more challenging and the more fun. Typically, 5, 7 or 11 point totals are selected. Usually starting with the youngest player and proceeding to that person's right, each person throws the four game sticks onto the rug before them. Depending on how the sticks land, the following points are possible.<br/><br/>* one &quot;couple,&quot; a &aacute;ayet and a hamma of the same color = one point<br/><br/>* two &quot;couples,&quot; both sets of &aacute;ayet and a hamma sticks = three points<br/><br/>* one &aacute;ayet and two hamma = two points. This combination refers to the Nim&iacute;ipuu practice of looking after a male friend's wife should he fall in combat.<br/><br/>* if there are no pairs matched, e.g., &aacute;ayet and a hamma of differing colors = no points<br/><br/>* but if all the sticks land caya, &quot;nothing&quot; = all points accumulated are lost and the player starts over.<br/><br/>After deciding on the win point total, be it 5, 7, or 11, the players need to agree on other rules. Will you need to win on the exact number, be it 5, 7 or 11, not going over that total? If a player gains points beyond the agreed upon win point total, will extra points over that total be subtracted from that player's earned points? As players gain points, they should always announce their totals in Nim&iacute;ipuutimptneewit.<br/><br/>Nim&iacute;ipuutimptneewit numbers:<br/><br/><br/>     n&aacute;aqc - one<br/>     lep&iacute;t - two<br/>     mit&aacute;at - three<br/>     p&iacute;ilept - four<br/>     p&aacute;axat - five<br/>     'oyl&aacute;aqc - six<br/>     'uyn&eacute;ept - seven<br/>     'oym&aacute;tat - eight<br/>     kuyc - nine<br/>     p&uacute;utimt - ten<br/>     p&uacute;utimt wax n&aacute;aqc - eleven (ten and one)<br/>     p&uacute;utimt wax lep&iacute;t - twelve (ten and two)<br/>     le'eptit - twenty<br/><br/><br/>"}, "19621": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Mental Floss Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2005", "usersrated": "70", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic94295_t.jpg", "average": "5.30143", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Pressman Toy Corp."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic94295.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Pressman edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Party Game", "Trivia"], "age": "16", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Developed in partnership with mental_floss magazine is a quick and quirky trivia game that you brainiacs will be sure to enjoy.

Fortunately, a mounted die-cut set of counters was available for like $1 additional, so we were spared the nightmare of trying to hand-mount two-sided counters &lt;shudder&gt;.<br/><br/>The Mapsheet consists of four sections (mine are hand-glued into one map) showing the island of Sicily, in light and dark blue and light and dark brown on white paper, 19&quot; x 27&quot; assembled. The Combat Results table (from 1-4 to 7-1), Terrain Effects chart (six types), Time Record track (12 four-day turns), Unit Designations Within Divisions chart (initial Axis), German Order Of Battle chart (reinforcements and &quot;What If?&quot; units), and Allied Order of Battle chart (initial and reinforcements) are all printed on the mapsheet. The starting Axis locations for the historical scenario are printed on the map, as are the historical and alternate Allied landing sites.<br/><br/>The Rulebook assembles into 8 pages. Front is picture, title and credits. Second page is historical info (&quot;Introduction&quot;). The next four pages are rules and victory conditions. Then 1/2-page of (six) alternate scenarios, 1/2 page of designer's notes, and 1/2-page of bibliography (on the last page, with instructions for assembling the mapsheet).<br/><br/>Units are mostly regiments and brigades (or similarly-sized kampfgruppen), with some battalions, some Italian divisions, and an Army HQ for each army (4). There are 120 of the 1/2&quot; counters -- 22 Americans (olive green, 3 are battalions, 1 is Army HQ), 18 British and Canadians (dark olive green, 1 is Army HQ), 39 Italians (yellow, 3 are divisions, 11 are battalions, 1 is Army HQ), 25 Germans (tan, 1 battalion, 1 Army HQ), and 16 blanks, some of each color. The mounted counters are unique in that the full-strength side is printed on what is normally considered the back of the counter. While it doesn't look as nice, it does actually facilitate handling the counters - they are easier to pick up. Another idea that never caught on.<br/><br/>This is not a complex game, more along the lines of the old Conflict games. The game sequence is 1. Allied airdrops; 2. Allies move; 3. Allied combat and post-combat moves; 4. Axis airdrops; 5. Axis moves; 6. Axis combat and post-combat moves. ZOCs are fluid for movement and rigid for combat. Combat is odds-based, with step losses, retreats and advances indicated for both attacker and defender. For example, at 1-1 odds, the results are: 1. Att 1 step retr 1, Def adv 1; 2. Att 2 steps retr 2, Def adv 1; 3. Att 1 step, Def 1 step retr 1; 4. no effect; 5. Def retr 1; 6. Def 1 step, retr 2. Stacking is 3 regt/brig. Rules for invasions, airdrops, supply, evacuations, and naval support fire are all simple and non-cluttered.<br/><br/>One interesting aspect is Italian desertion. On turn one, the Axis player must roll for every Italian non-infantry unit, losing it to desertion on a 3-6 on 1D6. The Italian infantry are sturdier, and will not desert unless attacked at 3-1 or more with no German unit within three hexes.<br/><br/>Victory conditions are based on three elements: Italian desertion, casualties, and cities held. Levels of victory are: Axis wins if he has more than 3/4 of Allied points, decisively if equal or more; game is drawn if Axis has less than 3/4 but at least 2/3 of Allies points; otherwise Allies win. Also, the Axis win immediately if they destroy both the US 7th Army and UK 8th Army HQs (not bloody likely).<br/><br/>I can't believe no one ever listed this game before.

Whenever a player goes over the limit, the right-hand player gets an island card.

Standing atop the Hill of Tara and contemplating the conjoined ringforts of Forradh and Teach Chormac, the games of Sacred Hill and High Kings of Tara were born.

From a more simple Sacred Hill, a go-like game with its' elemental challenges, to an all-out-brain-burner in the form of Poisoned Chalice... Project Kells combines the best of beauty, gameplay, theme, and replay value.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll be amazed at the possibilities.  Once you&rsquo;ve learned the basics, be prepared to delve deeper, because you&rsquo;re likely to be already hooked on this game.  Scoring with knots (instead of kingdoms) will get you addicted.<br/><br/><br/>     This first game: Sacred Hill introduces the basic elements of play.  The aim of both games is the same -- to have the least number of kingdoms by the time the game is ended, a kingdom being a group of linked ring forts.  There are two phases to the game.  In manoeuvres (first phase) you are building a network of unconnected ring forts scattered around the board.  In Battle (second phase) you are adding ring forts next to your own, linking them together with bridge tiles, to form larger (and fewer) kingdoms.  This starts to magically create the Celtic knotwork.  Isolated ring forts that are besieged must be captured.  No ties are possible with either ringfort scoring or knot scoring.===<br/>     The second game:  High Kings of Tara introduces the kings.  Each player has three which do the work of building your ring forts. They move like the knight in chess and add many more twists and turns to the game, taking it to another dimension.  Kings can capture enemy ring forts and kings; they can also be immobilized.  Your own kings cannot work in tandem and they must always move to a vacant hill whenever possible.  Ties are possible, but the duality of scoring pursuits (ringforts versus captured kings) usually prevents this possibility.  This is especially true in tournament scoring...<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Those who feel that they have mastered those variants are encouraged to try the real brain burner of the bunch.  Poisoned Chalice  Played at right angles to each other, each player tries to exert total control over each other from a position of inferiority. The end scoring is the same as in the Sacred Hill variant, but in this endeavor the limitations of placement create challenging strategic obstacles for both opponents.  It is possible to exert control over an opponent in such a way that at times they are limited to one possibility for tile placement.  However, there are twists that occur if a piece is captured (surrounded) on the board (like in 'go').  No ties are possible with either ringfort scoring or knot scoring.<br/><br/><br/>This is very probably the same game [system] as The High Kings of Tara.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English Collectors edition", "First edition", "Second edition", "Tailten Games Edition with award marks"], "name": "Project Kells: Sacred Hill, High Kings of Tara  & Poisoned Chalice", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Building", "Pattern Recognition", "Tile Placement"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "227", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "average": "6.26396"}, "19666": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jim Gladstone"], "poll": [], "name": "Gladstone's Games to Go", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Memory", "Paper-and-Pencil"], "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "16", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic297348_t.jpg", "average": "6.80625", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Quirk Books"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic297348.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Book", "Deduction", "Memory", "Party Game", "Puzzle", "Word Game"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Gladstone's Games to Go describes over 45 games, none requiring any special equipment beyond paper, pencils, and coins.

Clubs count as negative points, and diamonds require another card to be drawn for that column. The object of the game is not to simply win more cards, but to win &quot;point cards&quot;. Point cards start with the Aces, then move to Kings when all of the Aces are claimed, and so on. Play is continued until all points are claimed through a pre-agreed goal (for example, if playing to Queens, then the game will end when all Aces, Kings, and Queens are claimed).

It is situated on the south shores of the Lough Neargh, 20 miles south-west of Belfast.<br/><br/>Players progress around the board as a result of the roll of 2D6. When landing on a Company square a player may purchase a share in that company (there are two shares available in each company), if he wishes. If not he may put the share up for auction, with any excess over the sale price being retained by that player as his fee for being the auctioneer.<br/><br/>Players landing on companies that are already owned must pay to visit, with the payment due being based on how many shares are owned in that particular company and in the other two companies in the same colour series. Since shares can be owned by two different players both may demand payment from a visitor.<br/><br/>Certain squares on the board require the drawing of a Chance card which normally result in income being received from or paid to the bank.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;New Share Quotations&rdquo; square results in the changing of share prices for some of the blocks of companies. This will result in players losing or gaining money on the shares that they own. It also requires players to put up one of their shares for auction thereby permitting players to trade in shares.<br/><br/>The game can be ended in three ways, which should be decided before the game starts:<br/>- After a set time.<br/>- When the first player becomes bankrupt.<br/>- When all but one player has gone bankrupt.<br/><br/>At the end of the game the money is counted and shares are valued at whatever is the then current rate.

Movement and orientation are kept track of in three dimensions using a simple and intuitive (math-less) method of dealing with line of sight, along with easily understood indicators on the ship control sheets. Range determination is performed simply by measuring distance with a tape measure and checking a chart, to take into account altitude.<br/><br/>Damage is tracked through a common damage-box method with damageable systems individually represented, along with hit location charts on the ship control sheets. Weapon information is likewise available on the ship control sheets.<br/><br/>Aside from the 3D aspects of the game, here are some features in development which are not commonly found in starship combat games:<br/><br/>Computer Warfare - the ability for ships to infect enemy vessels with computer viruses, jam missile guidance systems, or even steal control of enemy weapons or systems.<br/><br/>Crew Levels - A ship may drop out of a fight if it takes too many losses to its crew.<br/><br/>Damage Control - Ships can make limited battlefield repairs, things like bringing a damaged weapon back online or getting a thruster to work again.<br/><br/>Fires - Ships can catch fire, fires can spread, and crew members can be sacrificed when fires are vented to space.<br/><br/>Fuel and cargo - Makes for a wider range of possible scenarios as well as a seamless tie-in to campaign games.<br/><br/>Adaptable Game System - While the game will provide its own exciting universe, from the ground up it is being designed with the intent that others can adapt it to their favorite universe with relative ease. Having this foundation will also give the game and its setting the ability to grow without the system falling apart or failing in some regard.<br/><br/>WHI will be consistent and predictable with its ability to simulate movement in space, but it will not be a rigid simulation or necessarily be mathmatically accurate. It will be relatively quick and easy to play but will not be simplistic. It will have a lot of detail suitable for a wide range of battle sizes as well as adaptation to other gaming applications (roleplaying, campaigns, etc), but will avoid being tedious or micromanagerial.<br/><br/>The goal is for the game to be fun to play, first and foremost.<br/><br/>"}, "19723": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Matthias Hunstig"], "poll": [], "name": "Bellum Numerorum", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2002", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic312457_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Schloss-Spiele"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic312457.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Bellum Numerorum is a abstract tactical boardgame for 2 players.

Structures are color-keyed green for low buildings and blue for multistory.<br/><br/>The playing pieces are squares and rectangles of 3/8&quot; plexiglass.  Self-adhesive colored stickers are applied producing lime-green miniature fire command vehicles, rescue ambulances, fire engines and ladder trucks.<br/><br/>The standard game is 24 turns long, represent a 24-hour shift.  Each turn, a die roll determines whether zero, one, or two alarms are received.  Each building on the map is marked with a street address.  Every time an alarm is received, a label corresponding to a board location is drawn randomly, indicating the site of the alarm.<br/><br/>An alarm may be indicated as a &quot;medical emergency, a &quot;call&quot; (corresponding to a &quot;local alarm&quot; in many fire departments) or a &quot;1st Alarm&quot; (potentially, a more serious situation).<br/><br/>The controlling Player determines which assets to dispatch to the scene depending on nature of incident and location.  Responses range from a single rescue ambulance for a medical emergency up to a multi-station response for a multistory structure, row house with multiple exposures or industrial complex.<br/><br/>Each game-turn is broken down into three impulses.  Each impulse, emergency vehicles may move up to eight squares toward a scene.  Physical space limitations often play a role, since alleys are only one square wide.  Pumpers take up two squares, ladder trucks three, making traffic control important when placing apparatus (particularly ladder trucks, which must be within reach of the structure in question).<br/><br/>Beginning in the second impulse, as long as at least one unit has arrived the controlling player may attempt to resolve the incident.  Resolution may determine that the call is a false alarm, that the fire has been extinguished, or that it continues to burn or intensifies.  At the player's discretion, he may wait until the third impulse before resolving the situation, in order to allow more assets to arrive.<br/><br/>Each unit type has a points value representing its firefighting capabilities.  Certain combinations of units--such as two engine companies, a truck company, and a chief officer--have a higher value than the face value of the units present, representing the fire ground tactics such combinations make possible--primary and secondary search, fire suppression, water supply, ventilation, exposure protection, fire ground command, etc.<br/><br/>The point total of firefighting assets present is cross-indexed to a die roll on the &quot;Results Table&quot; and an outcome determined.  Fires not extinguished at the end of the game-turn intensify one level (defined in the game as &quot;1st Alarm, 2nd Alarm,&quot; etc. through &quot;5th Alarm&quot;).  Fires of 2nd Alarm intensity or greater spread to adjacent spaces, either to a neighboring building or to additional spaces within a single large structure.  Poorly placed fire apparatus may also be destroyed by expanding fires.<br/><br/>Each new game-turn the alarm determination process is followed, meaning that new incidents may be generated.  It is important to hold some department assets in reserve to allow for responses to additional incidents.  The entire department numbers one &quot;Marshal&quot; (Chief of Department), three Battalion Chiefs, twelve Engine Companies, five Ladder Companies and six Rescue Ambulances distributed in six stations of various sizes.  Relocation of uncommitted assets is sometimes necessary to maintain adequate fire protection during major fires.<br/><br/>Rules cover wind direction, firefighter injuries, apparatus breakdown or other loss while responding, and, optionally, water supply.<br/><br/>The goal of FIRE is to maintain public safety at the lowest possible level of asset activity.  At the end of each turn, points are assessed for each unit out of quarters, whether fighting a fire or returning from a call.  The object is to achieve the lowest possible score while efficiently handling emergencies--a balancing act between dispatching sufficient assets and using assets efficiently.<br/><br/>"}, "19762": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Monty Stambler", "Ann Stambler"], "poll": [], "name": "Zoom Out!", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1999", "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic588294_t.jpg", "average": "4.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Gamewright"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic588294.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Gamewright edition 1999"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Players take turns playing their cards in an effort to be the first to run out of cards.

There were a total of two sets of cards released for the game. The first, Arena, was released in January, 2006. The second set, Secret Origins, was released in October, 2006. Since then, there have been no official releases.<br/><br/>The COHCCG was designed to be a quick game. Rather than using a turn structure where each player takes multiple actions in a row, the game used an alternating action structure. This lead to faster and more interactive games. Each player was represented by a Hero card, which began play with 2 starting powers. As their action, a player had many choices, including:<br/><br/><br/>    Play a card, being:<br/>         a Sidekick<br/>         a Power that can be used by the Hero or a Sidekick<br/>         an Enhancement on a Power already in play<br/>         an Edge card with the keyword &quot;Action&quot; or &quot;React&quot;<br/>    <br/>    Activate a Power already in play<br/>    Move the Hero or a Sidekick<br/>    Search your draw deck for a Sidekick<br/>    Recharge your Powers<br/>    Play a Mission card<br/>    Use the Defeat text on a mission to complete it<br/>    Draw 2 cards<br/><br/><br/>Unless otherwise specified by the cards played, play continued until only one Hero remained, who was declared the winner.<br/><br/>In addition to the 33 Heroes available in Arena and the 22 Heroes available in Secret Origins, players could create their own hero using &quot;Paragon&quot; Hero cards. These cards allowed a player to create new combinations of powers that were not available on existing Hero cards. Players could either play solely with the Paragon Hero cards available in the Arena set, or go online to access the HeroBuilder which allowed players to create Hero cards in the same template as the already available Heroes, including a picture uploaded by the player. Although the generic Hero cards listed all power sets available to the archetypes at the time, it wasn't until The Hamidon set was developed that many of those power sets were codified for use.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition", "Starter Kit"], "name": "City of Heroes CCG", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "average": "6.37021", "usersrated": "96", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Customizable Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["CCGs (Collectible Card Games)", "Superheroes"]}, "19767": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Michal Pisko"], "poll": [], "name": "Warriors in Antiquity", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "yearpublished": "2002", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic108592_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)", "games.Mantikora.com"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic108592.jpg", "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Ancient", "Wargame"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "&quot;Hail, dear warriors and women warriors!

And the Sultan is now dripping in cash &mdash; he can bribe city authorities so that his ships will gain preferential access to those ports where they are competing.

That might change the outlook &hellip; considerably, in fact &hellip; let&rsquo;s see&hellip;<br/><br/>Indonesia is a game in which two to five players build up an economy, trying to acquire the most money. Players acquire production companies, which produce goods (rice, spices, microwaveable meals, rubber, and oil), and shipping companies, which deliver goods to cities. As cities receive goods, they grow, increasing their demands. Production companies earn money for each good delivered to a city, up to the city's capacity, but they must pay shipping companies for the distance traveled, even if they end up losing money. Players can research advantages, like greater shipping capacity or the ability to merge companies, possibly stealing ownership of lucrative plantations or shipping routes by buying out other players.<br/><br/>Players keep their money hidden, trying to accumulate the most by the end of the third era. When only one type of a company is left, an era ends. New eras bring new cities, companies, and types of goods. At the end of the third era, the player with the most money wins. However, money earned from the last round of operations (selling/shipping goods) counts double, so it can be important to control the timing.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "First edition, second printing", "Second edition"], "average": "7.76997", "name": "Indonesia", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Auction/Bidding", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Stock Holding"], "age": "14", "usersrated": "2706", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Asian Theme", "Country: Indonesia"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 27 \u2013 Splotter Spellen Interview", "Heavy Cardboard Episode 21 \u2013 Indonesia", "Heavy Cardboard Episode 39 \u2013 Top 50 Favorite Games of Right Now", "Heavy Cardboard Episode 52 &ndash; Amanda&rsquo;s Top 50 &amp; Edward&rsquo;s Top 50", "HLG 11: Stilte voor de Storm", "HLG-EXTRA 3: Spiel 2016 Deel 1"]}, "19779": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Erik Isaac"], "poll": [], "name": "i win!", "playingtime": "1", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic103057_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Wanderlo Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic103057.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Publication"], "maxplaytime": "1", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "1", "description": "i win! is a card game with 16 cards with black-and-white illustrations of stick men and crudely drawn icons, plus a &quot;title&quot; card that directs you to a URL for the rules. <br/>i win! of responses.

King Alfred has hired the best rat trappers in his kingdom to rid his castle of the lowly vermin before his Queen returns. The problem? The Queen will arrive in only six hours!

But the Wizard also has an interest in what you trap. Will you be able to match wits with your competition and secure the rights of trap master in this land? Can you catch the vilest and most numerous of rats and secure your position as a member of the King&rsquo;s loyal staff?<br/><br/>Goal of the game:<br/>The players will move from room to room trying to trap as many of the rats as they can, by using magic items and outmaneuvering their opponents.<br/>The rats have three point values depending on their degree of nastiness:<br/>    1: plain old rat<br/>    2: aggressive rat<br/>    3: diseased rat<br/>The rats also come in four colours:<br/>    black, white, grey, and brown.<br/>Most of the valuable rats are of black colour, followed by brown, grey, and white. This may lead some players to choose to pursue only black or brown rats in their quest. However, the Wizard is a strange sort and wants to use the rats of all colours for his potions and magic. He rewards players handsomely for having rats of each colour. Keeping in mind that the white rats are the least common, and the black rats are most numerous, it is the rat trapper who can balance the best of both strategies who will ultimately win the game.<br/>This game features a very innovative game board design: a northern cross section of the castle is one one side of the board, and the southern cross section of the castle is on the other side of the board, in such a way that the roofs are almost touching. Each room presented on the cross sections have doors leading east/west/both, but also have a door set into their back wall of the room which leads to the other side of the board and the other cross section.<br/><br/>"}, "19793": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Dieter Danziger"], "poll": [], "name": "Robber Barons", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "3", "yearpublished": "2005", "usersrated": "38", "boardgamefamily": ["Winsome Essen Sets"], "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1267686_t.jpg", "average": "6.16184", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Winsome Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1267686.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Trains"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "Robber Barons was the only full game from the 2005 Winsome Games set (it also included some Age of Steam maps).

Players roll to move around an intersecting track that includes a space for each state and spaces with instructions (Free TV, Major Fundraiser, Go to Home Region, Good News, Minor Set-Back, Minor Foul-Up, Major Disaster).<br/><br/>The states are divided into five regions, and ranked within each region. Players pick a region and roll for Home State on 2D6 within the region. When a player lands on an unclaimed state, it goes up for auction (with conditions). A player can grab another state in his home region for the minimum bid; if in another candidate&rsquo;s home region, it is a two-way auction with that candidate; otherwise all can participate. Landing on a controlled state requires paying money (more if the owner is there or it is part of a bloc of 7+ states in its region). Players can trade states and money at any time.<br/><br/>Players can win in one of four ways: Front Runner (majority of the 1500 total delegate votes); Regional Bloc (control 7+ states in each of 3 regions);  Key States (control 10+ of the 15 states ranked #1, #2 and #3 in their regions, including 2+ #1s); and Balanced National Appeal (control 5+ states from each of 4 regions).<br/><br/>After 1.5 hours, the game moves to a Convention round, where players not meeting minimum levels are eliminated, everyone gets bonus money and all auctions are open.

All tiles are divided into a black and white triangular half, with a landing space on each side for the playing piece of that colour. Tiles have a handle stuck in the middle that enables them to be lifted up, twisted round and replaced without the risk of having pieces slip off. Both the black and white player have 6 stones in their respective colours that start on opposite sides of the board. All tiles initially face the same direction, so that no two touching sides have the same colour and hence no &quot;connections&quot; exist on the board at the start of play.<br/><br/>By twisting tiles, players can create &quot;connections&quot; of identically coloured halves, creating a corridor along which pieces of that colour can progress. Each turn players either twist one tile in the aim to improve the available route, or move a stone along one of those routes. Players try to remove all stones in their colour from the other side of the board. The first to do so is the winner. A tile that has just been lifted gets a red marker on it. It prevents that tile from being turned by the player who is next. Additionally, it also prevents 1 or 2 neighbouring tiles from being turned, as long as a connection in that player's colour was created to the neighbouring tile(s) by the newly placed one.

The checkers represent battling armored robots, and the stones represent arguments in a philosophical disagreement between two logicians.  These two sub-games, battling robots and arguing philosophers, are played simultaneously on the same board.  You win by winning either sub-game.<br/><br/>In the robot sub-game, you start with your robots on your side of the board.  On each turn, you can either move a single robot or fire on an enemy robot with all the friendly robots that are within range.  You win if one of your robots reaches the opponent's side of the board.<br/><br/>In the philosophers sub-game, you attempt to make an unbroken string of stones in your color from one side of the board to the other.  On each turn, you place a single stone of your color, if possible. Otherwise, you move a single stone of either color.  If neither is possible, then your opponent wins.<br/><br/>The sub-games interact in two ways.  First, a stone cannot be played on the corner of a space containing a robot.  Second, if a space containing a robot has one or more stones on its corners, that robot receives a defensive bonus when attacked.<br/><br/>The most novel aspect of Ironclad lies in the choice of which sub-game to play in.  On each turn, a player makes two moves, one in each sub-game.  However, the player only gets to decide on the move in one of the sub-games.  The player's opponent gets to decide on the player's move in the other sub-game.  So the player chooses one of the sub-games and makes a move in that sub-game, then the opponent moves for the player in the other sub-game.<br/><br/>"}, "19834": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Bus Stop", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pick-up and Deliver", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1996", "usersrated": "32", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Children's Games"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic94284_t.jpg", "average": "4.4375", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Orchard Toys"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic94284.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition", "French Edition", "Orchard Toys second edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Educational", "Math", "Transportation"], "age": "4", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "A game for Ages 4 - 8.

Each card may act as a building, a client, a raw material, or a valuable resource, frequently forcing players into difficult decisions regarding how each card should be used. In addition, much of the game is played from the discard pool, giving players some control over what cards are accessible to opponents.  Actions are triggered by a form of card-driven role selection -- the active player leader a role, and other players may follow if they discard a matching card from hand (to the pool).  Players who don't follow may 'think' to draw more cards.  There are thus strong interactions between the different uses of cards.  Scoring is a combination of completing buildings and storing resources, with end-of-game bonuses for storing a diverse assortment.

Here they are making a sledge dash for the pole, and at last planting the flag upon the untrod solitudes that surround the Axis of the Earth.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;McLoughlin Bros. rules&quot;...4 different colored men and an indicator are used in order to get to the North Pole and then return. The indicator is spun resulting in a number from one to six (just like a die). Each player uses a route of his color in an attempt to reach the gold spot where the four paths intersect and then proceeds to the NORTH POLE spot and then returns back to the start. Any number of players can come home using the same route. If during that return a piece is jumped over with another's piece that jumped over piece must go back 3 spaces. If that spot is also occupied then another further spot must be retreated....<br/><br/>"}, "19868": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "The Motor Carriage Game", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1899", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic94837_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Parker Brothers"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic94837.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Racing", "Sports", "Transportation"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "A roll-and-move race game involving early automobiles racing through the park.<br/><br/>&quot;At this time, when the use of electric carriages is growing so rapidly, a game of this subject is most opportune.

The players race to reach the ending space, depicting The Immortal Man.<br/><br/>RULES OF THE GAME (engraved in the centre of the playing surface)<br/><br/>The Immortal Man, who has existed 84 years, seems worthy of his Talents and Merit to become for the Close of Life, which can end only by Eternity. When we shall arrive at the No.84, we shall have gain'd all we can by this Game, but if we exceed this number, we must go back as many points as we have proceeded beyond it. <br/>The Age of Man is divided into seven periods of 12 years, viz. Infancy to Youth, Manhood, Prime of Life, Sedate Middle Age, Old Age, Decrepitude and Dotage. He passes through life in a variety of situations which are arrange in the order they generally succeed each other. <br/>This game like all others of the same kind is played with a totum, each Player spinning twice in his turn, the only difference is, that the Players cannot stop at any one of the seven ages, but must proceed as many points beyond, as they have in coming to them. Yet as they may spin at the first 2 sixes and consequently would go onto 84, which would be most improper, those who have this chance at first, must content them selves with going to the Historian at 39. <br/>The Studious Boy at 7 shall receive a Stake and shall proceed to 42, the place of the Orator. <br/>The Negligent Boy at 11 shall pay a Stake and shall remain two rounds without spinning. <br/>The Assiduous Youth at 15 shall receive 2 Stakes, and proceed to 55, where he will find the Patriot. <br/>The Triflet at 19 shall pay 1 Stake, and proceed to the Songster at 38. <br/>The Duellist at 22 shall pay 2 Stakes, and return to take the place of the Boy at Number 3. <br/>The Complaisant Man at 26 shall remain there, and let others play until another comes to take his place, and then he shall go back to the place of his liberator. <br/>The Prodigal at Number 30 shall pay four Stakes, and go back to the Careless Boy at Number 6. <br/>The Married Man at 34 shall receive two Stakes for his Wife's Portion and go to be a Good Father at 56. <br/>The Romance Writer at 40 shall pay 2 Stakes and go back to the Mischievous Boy at 5. <br/>The Dramatist at 44 shall pay 4 Stars to the Masters of his Art and shall begin the game again. <br/>The Benevolent Man at 52 shall go to 78 to amuse himself with the Joker. <br/>The Temperate Man at 58 shall go to 82, to find the Quiet Man. <br/>The Drunkard at 63 shall pay 2 Stakes and go back to the Child at 2. <br/>The Patient Man at 68 shall receive 2 Stakes and go to amuse himself with the merry fellow at 80. <br/>The Manhater at 71 shall pay 2 Stakes and go back to the Obstinate Youth at 16. <br/>The Old Beau at 74 shall receive 1 Stake and let each of the others play one round. <br/>The Satyrist at 77 shall pay 4 Stakes and go back to the Malignant Boy at 8. <br/>Lastly the Tragic Author at 45 shall go to the place of the Immortal Man at 84 and win the Game by Succeeding him.<br/><br/>DIRECTIONS AND EXPLANATIONS (engraved in the spandrels) <br/>1. The Utility and Moral Tendency of this Games. <br/>If parents who take upon themselves the pleasing task of instructing their children (or others to whom that important trust may be delegated) will cause them to stop at each character and request their attention to a few moral and judicious observations, explanatory of each character as they proceed and contrast the happiness of a virtuous and well spent life with the fatal consequences arising from vicious and immoral pursuits, this game may be rendered the most useful and amusing of any that has hitherto been offered to the public. <br/>2. Directions for Playing <br/>This game may be played by any number of persons at a time; but care must be taken, that each player makes use of a different mark to move with, and be provided with at least twelve counters each, and agree how much to value them per dozen. <br/>Let us then suppose that four gentlemen agree to play a game together, and stake four counters each. A takes red for his mark, B green, C black and D white. A begins and spins 9 and accordingly places his mark upon No. 9, which is the Docile Boy. B plays next and spins 7, but as the rules of the game specify instead of putting his mark on No.7, he must receive a counter from the pool, and carry his mark to the Orator, at No. 42. C being next in turn, spins only 2, and puts his mark on the place of the Child at No. 2. D being the last player spins 11, and goes to the Negligent Boy; but this being a forfeit, he must pay a counter to the pool and remain two rounds at No. 11 without playing in his turn. A now resumes the totum and spins 3, which brings him from No. 9 where he was to No. 12, but this being one of the seven ages, he cannot stop there, for agreeable to the rules of the game he must proceed as far beyond the age to No. 15, the place of the Assidious Youth; but instead of that he must receive 2 counters from the pool and go to No. 55, the place of the Patriot. B now takes the totum and spins 6, when being already at No. 42, the place of the Orator, he should naturally go to No. 48 but that being the age of the Sedate Man, he must proceed 6 points beyond 48 and put his mark on the place of the Vigilant Man at no 54. C's turn being but instead of stopping at this last number (according to the rules of the game) he pays a counter into the pool and goes to the place of the Songster at No. 38. D must as already mentioned also remain this round without playing. A again takes the totum and spins 2, and being before at No. 82 compleats No. 84 takes the place of the Immortal Man and wins the game.<br/><br/>NB. It is necessary to inform the Purchaser the Totum must be marked with the figures 1-6 and avoid introducing a dice box into private families, each player must spin twice, which will answer the same purpose.<br/><br/><br/>The playing sheet is numbered in an anti-clockwise direction starting from the lower left corner.

Until everyone finishes the hole, order of play is determined by whoever is farthest from the current hole. Whoever is farthest takes the next swing. On your turn, while you are on the fairway or rough, roll both dice. You must move your ball in a straight line (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) as follows: (1) the total of both dice (2) the number on either die (3) the difference between the two dice.<br/><br/>Playing from a sand trap has a potential penalty. Play the stroke as usual, but then roll one die again. If it is a 1, there's no penalty. A 2, 3 or 4 adds one penalty stroke.

A surprise Confederate attack, led by Albert Sydney Johnston, nearly swept encamped Union defenders into the Tennessee River. The next day, a reinforced Union army counter-attacked and drove the CSA line back in confusion and retreat. A CSA victory might have ruined the career of General Ulysses S. Grant. Instead, the battle ended with a Union victory, the death of Johnston, and the eventual demise of Confederate hopes in the West. Days 1 and 2 can be played separately or together.<br/><br/>Shiloh was initially developed from the Gettysburg: Badges of Courage game system. However, the game mechanics have been completely overhauled. The map is divided into large areas and combat is resolved within areas. The game plays using the fast-paced Move-Move-Battle sequence seen in Hammer of the Scots and Julius Caesar. There are no cards involved; players activate leaders to command brigades of the same division or corps. The game plays smoothly and quickly; each player gets to play one day on offense and one day on defense for a great gaming experience.

The game combines detailed individualized players cards for every player position with specific offensive and defensive play calls to generate action.<br/><br/>Here is a brief description of play from the manufacturer's web-site:<br/><br/>First, let&rsquo;s set the scene. It&rsquo;s the first round of the playoffs, with Miami hosting New England. Miami&rsquo;s got the ball on the New England 37 yard line with 4:23 to go in the fourth quarter. They&rsquo;re down by a touchdown.<br/><br/>The Miami coach selects a passing play, &ldquo;F1 Cross&rdquo; (F1 is the flanker, and he&rsquo;s running a crossing pattern over the middle of the field).<br/><br/>The play card is essentially a 3&rdquo; x 5&rdquo; card filled with information about the ensuing play. The larger letters (s, T, G, C, Q, etc.) represent offensive players. The boxes and ovals represent defensive zones which may or may not be occupied by one or more defensive players. The lines represent the routes each of the offensive players takes after the snap. The red line represents the route taken by the intended receiver. Blue lines represent secondary receivers, while black lines represent the motion taken by blockers.<br/><br/>The smaller letters are the player ratings, which are followed by a number or range of numbers, which correspond to a 20-sided (d20) die.<br/><br/>So let&rsquo;s roll the dice and see what happens&hellip;<br/><br/>20 sided die = 2 <br/>12 sided die = 6<br/>2 six sided die roll = 1+3 = 4<br/><br/>The d20 roll (2) tells us what the matchup is. In this case, the left guard is matched up against the defender in the zone opposite him (in this case, the right defensive tackle).<br/><br/>Here are the two players involved on the play:<br/><br/>J. Buckley [G - Miami 97]<br/>Hen. Thomas [DT - New England 97]<br/><br/>The offensive player&rsquo;s &ldquo;D&rdquo; rating (pass blocking) is now compared to the &ldquo;B&rdquo; rating (pass rush) of the defensive player&rsquo;s. These two ratings are subtracted (6 &ndash; 4 = 2) and compared to the d10 (in this case, a 6 was rolled). Since 6 is larger than 2, the defensive player wins the matchup.<br/><br/>Now, the two d6 are added together (1 + 3 = 4). Since Thomas won the matchup, we look under his &ldquo;B&rdquo; column across from &ldquo;4&rdquo; and find the result code of &ldquo;47&rdquo;. This is a sack! (Result codes are listed on the field&hellip;there are approximately 90 of them.)<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s it! All other plays are completed in a similar fashion.<br/><br/>"}, "19905": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Simon Spearing"], "poll": [], "name": "Dogs Do", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Enclosure", "Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "2005", "usersrated": "8", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Dogs"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic95094_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic95094.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Print and Play edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Territory Building"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Imagine you are a dog.

The game comes in a tin box and contains: 224 cards, wooden pieces, 1 plastic chip and rules.<br/><br/>The game is designed in German and English. One deck has German and English topics, such as Clothing, Holidays, Politics, Ancient Egypt and so on. The deck is written in German and English. The other deck has some letters to start a word and some letters to end a word. So a card might have PE... and ...ING, or it might have T... and ...E and so on. Players have six of these cards face-up in front of them. Three of the Topic cards are dealt up for all to see and then a letters card is turned up.<br/><br/>As quickly as you can, you make a word fitting one of the topics, starting or ending with a card in your six, and starting or ending with the table card. That is, if you use one of your cards to start a word, then you use the ending from the table card. Or the other way round: if your word starts with the table card, then you use an ending from one of your six.<br/><br/>The game has two decks for the letters, one in English, one in German. That way, you get the right kind of starting and ending letters to suit your language.<br/><br/>Players put markers on the Topics with a correct choice, and flip their card they used (worth one point), and draw a fresh table card. When any Topic card gets a third marker, that player gets the Topic card face down (worth three points) and a fresh Topic is drawn. When any player is down to one letter card, there's a special speed round, then the players reset their cards. The game ends after the third speed round.<br/><br/>It is a simple game idea and yet very challenging to find words and then find how to fit them to the letters available.

When a player spots a pattern on his or her turn, he or she takes one of the non-central chips from the pattern and moves the chip from the center of the board into the vacated spot.

This requires a steady hand, to place your cards firmly on the ice berg.<br/><br/>The game consists of a deck of cards, some counters and two icebergs (three dimensional cardboard stands). At the beginning of each game, each player receives a number of cards, of which three are face up. Each turn a player tries to get rid of one of his face up cards. This is done by placing the cards on one of the icebergs. How exactly the card is to be placed is determined by the animal depicted on the card. Some cards need to be placed against a side of the iceberg, others need to be on top, etc. In some cases, it is not the card that needs to be placed, but a cardboard counter (using the card as a tool).<br/><br/>If a player succeeds in placing his card, he draws a new card from his pile and puts it next to his other face up cards.

Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn German language in the first place.<br/><br/>The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Gesundheit und Ern&auml;hrung &quot; contains historical events related to things that went wrong completely.
