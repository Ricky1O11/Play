Each act is meant to be played in a single sitting (1.5-2 hours), and then strung together into an epic 3-act story, concluding with a massive boss fight. That boss is defined by the earlier 3-acts and since the game features lots of different acts, there is lots of replay value.<br/><br/>During the game, players use a bag of tokens that represents their characters &quot;stats.&quot; When players use various abilities, instead of rolling dice to check for success, they will draw tokens from their bag and check the various icons and runes to see if they succeed. As players level-up, they will swap in ever-more-impressive tokens.<br/><br/>These token bags are also used by the heroes' enemies. Get set on fire? Put a fire token in your bag and you'll be on-fire until you draw it out. Get poisoned?

It is Sunday. The old pope is dead and now the race is on for the election of the new pope. You&rsquo;re one of the hopefuls in this election, however, not everyone is on your side&hellip; yet. But don&rsquo;t worry, they&rsquo;ll come around once you show them a little financial appreciation. After all, everyone has a vote, and everyone can be bought. And once the new pope is elected, the richest player wins&mdash;just like in real life.<br/><br/>The goal in Habeamus is to amass more money than the other players, while electing a new pope. Every player has one vote, and there are three non-player cardinals with a vote each as well. During their turns, players can place bribes face-down on the non-player cardinals in the middle of the playing field. These cardinals will vote for whomever promises the largest bribe when the vote starts.<br/>Each player also has a vote that they can use for themselves, or sell to other players. Every player can make hidden or open bribe offers to other players. If, during the vote count, a player accepts an offer by another player, that bribe goes into their account. However, if they do not accept the offer, the player making the offer gets the bribe into their account. In this way, players will have to balance their offers to other players and make sure they themselves sell their vote for a good price. To shake things up a bit more, a player can increase the papal salary, or play actions to change the bribes already on offer.<br/>Once all cards have been played, the votes are counted. If a pope is elected, he will receive a salary bonus into their account. Then, every player counts their money and the richest player wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "14", "name": "Habeamus", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Hand Management", "Trading"], "average": "8", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "220056": {"statistics": [], "bgaccessoryversion": ["First edition"], "description": "English Cards to replace the German cards for the German version of El Grande<br/><br/>", "usersrated": "0", "boardgameaccessory": ["El Grande"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Rio Grande Games"], "poll": [], "average": "0", "name": "El Grande: English Cards"}, "220057": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "HackJournal (Issue 40 - Fall 2012)", "rpgdesigner": ["James Butler", "Anthony Carpenter", "Nickolas Gildersleeve", "Jerimy J.

Players step into the role of village farmers, who must use their feisty canine companions to help them herd back the lost flocks.<br/><br/>Ewetopia is charming, fast-paced, easily-to-learn, and hard-to-master. With warm, friendly graphics that have appeal for kids, it will also appeal to older audiences with it&rsquo;s deceptively tactical game play: A strong denial game, board control, and a playing field that can change with every turn means Ewetopia enjoy plenty of play-time with old and young alike.<br/><br/>Players command their trusty dog around a 5x5 grid filled with tiles containing numerically ranked sheep, pushing rows and columns of them, adding the tiles that get pushed off the grid to their collection. The dogs are very fast and will always move at least 2 squares during their turn, so although they can be made to change direction after their 1st move, they can&rsquo;t then move back into the square they just came from: Players will need to plan their turn to avoid collecting the wrong tiles or ending up out-of-position.<br/><br/>Opponents&rsquo; dogs can&rsquo;t be pushed and will create obstacles on the board, but if this happens, or if a player wants to create a better move for themselves, fences can be built in the way of the charging sheep, diverting their path in a direction of the player's choice. Since these fences remain in the ground until the end of the game --and act the same for every player-- the result is a maze-like meadow where creative, zigzag moves aren&rsquo;t just possible, but become the norm.<br/><br/>Adding to the brain-twisting mix are special tiles, including:<br/>Motivating Bones: When collected, can be consumed at any time to &ldquo;motivate&rdquo; a dog to move an extra square. Useful to push your dog to get a rare sheep, or to force an opponent to make tough choice if their dog is in a bad position.<br/>Wild Sheep: A mythical breed with technicolor wool, these sheep can count as any rank at the end of the game, making them especially versatile.<br/>Wolves: A snarky, stenchy wolf-pack have sneakily donned sheep costumes in order to blend into the herd. Their own rank, having them at the end of the game will reduce your score by stinking up your other sheep&rsquo;s wool.<br/>Wood Carts: Contains enough lumber to build an additional fence on the board when traded in, and may be used immediately after being collected.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, points are awarded based on sizes of unbroken, numerical sequences AND sets of same-ranked sheep, allowing players to pursue different paths to victory if their original plans are foiled. Point values scale logarithmically with size, meaning a single big set or sequence will always be better than several smaller ones. After separating their sheep into the largest sets and/or sequences possible, totaling their values --and subtracting points for wolves-- the player with the highest score is the victor!<br/><br/>"}, "220145": {"rpgdesigner": ["Tristan Blind", "Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Cuende", "Romain d'Huissier", "S\u00e9bastien Delfino", "Laurent Devernay", "Michel Fagherazzi", "Virginie \"Kali\" Gros", "Julien Heylbroeck", "Fay\u00e7al Lalmi", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Larr\u00e9", "Romuald Renaud", "Sanne Stijve", "Nathalie Zema"], "statistics": [], "name": "DI6DENT (Issue 5 - May 2012)", "rpgartist": ["Julien de Jaeger", "Josselin Grange", "Aur\u00e9lie Jouannin", "David Robert", "Corentin \"MadTroll\" Th\u00e9ry"], "rpgproducer": ["Matthieu Carbon", "Julien Cl\u00e9ment", "Julien de Jaeger", "Ludovic Papa\u00efs", "David Robert", "Vincent Ziec"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3406926.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["DI6DENT"], "rpg": ["C.O.P.S.", "CthulhuTech", "Fiasco", "Mouse Guard", "Mutant Chronicles 3rd Edition Roleplaying Game", "Ryuutama"], "rpgpublisher": ["plansix"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF Version", "Print Version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3406926_t.jpg", "description": "DI6DENT<br/>Issue 5<br/>Mai 2012<br/><br/>Le R&ocirc;liste, Voyageur Immobile?<br/><br/>"}, "220147": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3503594.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Benoit Vogt"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2017", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["David Demaret", "Martin Lavat"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Monolith", "Mythic Games"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3503594_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Ancient", "Card Game", "Dice", "Expansion for Base-game", "Miniatures", "Mythology", "Wargame"], "description": "The Gorgon is a sight to behold, though looking at her may be inadvisable because her return gaze can turn you to stone.

May the Force be with you!<br/><br/><br/>Years ago, I was a freelancer, then editor, then line editor, for West End Games' Star Wars roleplaying game line.<br/><br/>An illustrator friend, Darren Calvert (who I have wanted to work on something with for more years than I care to count), recently sent me some portraits he'd drawn of the Rogue One primary cast and asked if I wanted to &quot;stat&quot; them in the style of the WEG Star Wars RPG.<br/><br/>He'd drawn them very much in a style reminiscent of the WEG material, and as I began to hunt for reference material to begin writing up the characters' game stats, I thought it might be fun to not just post the stats, but to lay the whole thing out like an old WEG product.<br/><br/>That led to a week of design necromancy &mdash; trying to remember the approved font choices, the paragraph styles, and so on, in order to create a faithful reproduction (though I did tweak some things that always bugged me, including the &quot;opening crawl&quot;); it's close, but some of it, by design, authentic enough without being a straight up reproduction.<br/><br/>It occurs to me: Much of what I know about page and logo design actually came from sitting in the West End art department, peppering the guys in there with a million questions, so thanks (for many things) are due to Tom O'Neill, Brian Schomburg, Tim Bobko and Stephen Crane.<br/> Thanks are also due to Darren, who is a hell of an artist and a great guy into the bargain. Thanks for reaching out, my friend.<br/><br/>I should also point out: these are NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT &quot;official&quot; or approved in any way&mdash;I researched the entries just as I would've back in the WEG days, by culling through what official material is available publicly (notably the movie adaptation novel, and the Rogue One visual guide). But I have friends at Lucasfilm, so I want to make sure there's no confusion here. This ain't a real thing &mdash; just some goofy fun. It's not for sale, Darren and I don't own the characters, we're not challenging the copyright, we're not using it to make money, and speaking purely for myself, it's not intended as a resum&eacute; piece &mdash; it's just fan-work.<br/><br/>Hopefully, it will amuse any of you old-school D6-system fans out there.<br/> There are two versions of the PDF available: a &quot;mint condition&quot; one, and a &quot;vintage&quot; one that's been digitally weathered and &quot;aged.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "220253": {"rpgartist": ["Joseph Arnold", "Jacob Blackmon", "Molly Alice Hoy", "Denise Jones", "Joe Singleton"], "rpg": ["Mutants & Masterminds (3rd Edition)"], "poll": [], "name": "The Super Villain Handbook Deluxe Mutants & Masterminds Expansion", "rpgdesigner": ["Ade Smith", "Jason Tondro"], "rpgproducer": ["Mike Lafferty", "Ade Smith"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3408628.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Fainting Goat Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Super-Powered by M&M"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3408628_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>NOTE: THIS PRODUCT REQUIRES YOU TO HAVE THE DELUXE EDITION OF THE SUPER VILLAIN HANDBOOK FOR ICONS.

Their obsession could result in an unhealthy pattern of behavior that they are unable to break, like gambling or pursuing a romantic interest.

There were several reasons that the Americans finally decided to invade the Marianas: Firstly, it was the most direct route to Japan, Secondly, they could base B29 bombers there which could bomb Tokyo, Thirdly, Saipan would be the first piece of prewar Japanese soil taken during the war. Lastly, the American planners hoped that they could draw the Japanese fleet into a decisive engagement.

Use your ingenuity and the skill of your team of technomancers to cross the continent of Indines while connecting towns and building a vibrant trade network. Research new spells as you carve a path through the many treacherous terrains of the continent, using your company's unique advantages to outbuild the competition and secure supply lines for rare resources.<br/><br/>In Empyreal: Spells &amp; Steam, technomancers use mana to build rails, and the amount of mana crystals required to cast a spell varies by terrain and by the potency of the spell. Mana crystals must recharge after being used, so your choice of when and where to use each spell will be critical to determining the efficiency of your construction engine.<br/><br/>The towns you choose to connect to your network will provide critical resources, and the value of these resources changes over time. Some become more valuable as they become more connected, while others become less valuable as their abundance increases.

Many adventurers are familiar with wading into combat against monsters and small groups of enemies, but this is nothing next to the glory and chaos and carnage that is true war. More than simply a change in scale, the difference between war and other combat can be profound. In a war, the characters are part of something larger than themselves, contributing to the efforts of their armies, or perhaps leading those armies themselves. The priorities of a soldier are different from those of an adventurer, and often the challenges that they face are, as well. While many characters can translate their talents as adventurers to the battlefield, one who specifically focuses on warfare and battlefield tactics will have the edge on others when it comes to true war. Each installment of Weekly Wonders: Archetypes of War provides six new war-themed archetypes for a variety of classes.<br/><br/>For this book, we focus on ranged attackers. Archers and riflemen are powerful forces on the field of battle, and can have a huge impact on the outcome of any conflict. Able to deliver devastating attacks from a safe range, any general with the capability to black then sky with arrows has a huge advantage over his foes, quite possibly deciding the fate of the battle before the two sides even close upon one another. This book focuses on making archetypes to support this kind of powerful artillery support in a variety of classes, some of which might not be the first you would associate with the strategy.<br/><br/>    The invisible sniper, a gunslinger archetype that focuses on taking out foes from great distances.<br/>    The multiblaster, a kineticist archetype that can channel her energy into multiple blasts at once, allowing her to target many foes simultaneously.<br/>    The pinpoint marksman, a ranger archetype that focuses on delivering ranged attacks to precise spots on the body, making called shots to cripple his foes.<br/>    The cunning thrower, a slayer archetype that can deliver surprisingly powerful volleys of attacks with thrown weapons that are as deadly as they are precise.<br/>    The bowmage, a sorcerer archetype that delivers its spells through magic-imbued arrows.<br/>    A bonus archetype for the harbinger, from Path of War Expanded by Dreamscarred Press, the arrow of sorrow claims victims from a range and delivers a variety of potent curses.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "220396": {"rpgartist": ["Justin Mason"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgseries": ["Mini-Dungeon Collection"], "name": "Pit Your Wits (5E)", "rpgdesigner": ["Stephen Yeardley"], "rpgproducer": ["Stephen Yeardley"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3412176.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["AAW Games"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3412176_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>A 5th Edition compatible adventure for four to six PCs of levels 1-2<br/><br/>The PCs&rsquo; arrival at a small, well-established mining site, after a request to clear some &ldquo;mutated goblins&rdquo;, reveals an unexpected, disturbing sight.

It is both fun for kids (ages 6+) and engaging for adults! Strategy, a sense of humor, and a bit of scheming is all it takes for loads of fun and laughter.<br/><br/>Each deck comes with 108 cards, and the total game time is anywhere from about 10-30 minutes. The goal of the game is simple. Be the first to collect 4 of the same kind of nut and move them from your nut &quot;surplus&quot; (cards in your hand) to your winter &quot;stash&quot; (cards you play on the table). Easy right? Ahhhh, but you need to watch out! The sly fox, ravenous raccoon, sneaky squirrel and stinky skunk are all after your nuts too, and players might play one of these cards on their turn to take a nut from you (or your stash) OR make you lose your turn by switching the direction of play!<br/><br/>"}, "220410": {"rpgdesigner": ["John Abrahamson", "Richard Bark", "Alison Brooks", "Greg Costikyan", "Paul Creelman", "Michael Cule", "David Flin", "Matt Frisbee", "Daniel Gallant", "Steve Gilham", "Lee Gold", "Jenny Hein", "Peter Hildreth", "Michael Hopcroft", "Colin Ingham", "Spike Y.

Contained within this tome are the following guidebooks:<br/><br/>    Dwarven Clanhomes - these massive underground cavern seem to show the very mountain's favor upon this stocky race. Their smith's are without equal and their miners can sniff gems out that are hidden to all others. Yet, there's more to the dwarves - a society rich with lore &amp; tradition as much as metal &amp; jewels.<br/>    Elvish Nation: The beutiful fae are the artistic ones; their architecture exhibits a deep love of nature. These are the scholars, mages and druids of the land. After all, their long lives allow generations of study. Learn about the Life Bond, a spiritual connection and The Becoming, the greatest punishment of the nation.<br/>    Galea: A beacon of equality and created from a desire to flee the horros of the Kal-A-Nar Empire, this country is ruled by a king both strong and fair. Many brave heroes have come from the noble houses - as have many great quests.<br/>    Mindoth's Tower & Archanaya - The Druids &amp; Church of Light have little in common, yet work in concert towards many goals. Each stands in the light and understands that learning and the exchange of ideas are the path to growth.<br/>    Olara - Tough, stroung warriors of the north: these dowr soldiers hide souls of great beauty. Ever vigilant, they keep close eyes upon the nations of Shaya'Nor and Kal-A-Nar. These folk are the broad shoulders upon which the strength of the Southern Kingdoms rests.<br/>    Serenity - The City of Secrets is at a crossrods in the Wildlands and is a place of intrigue and politics with a dash of religion and trade thrown together. There's something here for everyone.<br/>    The Freelands - The true experiement in personal choice.

By replacing some of their cards with drawn ones and playing capacities, they will progressively gain knowledge of their game and the ones of their opponents, whom they will steal cards from.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, the players&rsquo; scores are marked down and added to the ones of previous rounds. A game ends when one of the players reaches 100 points, the winner being the one who has the least. For a shorter game, a maximum score of 50 points can be set.<br/><br/>The theme is post-apocalyptic, the illustrations being humoristic creatures and heroes inspired by old movies.<br/><br/>"}, "220462": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3445248.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Mark H.
