In all variations of the game, the player must apportion a limited amount of fuel in order to land on the moon without crashing.<br/><br/>Lunar Lander started as a text-based computer game and went by the names Rocket, Lunar, LEM, and Apollo. Lunar was originally written in the FOCAL programming language for the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-8 computer by Jim Storer while a student at Lexington High School (Massachusetts) in the fall of 1969. A somewhat different version called Rocket was written in BASIC by Eric Peters at DEC, and a third version, LEM, also in BASIC was written by William Labaree II of Alexandria, Virginia. David H. Ahl converted Jim Storer's FOCAL version to BASIC, changed some of the dialog, published it in the EDU newsletter and distributed it through DEC's Education Product Group, which he headed at the time. A year or so later, all three BASIC versions first appeared under the names ROCKET (Storer version), ROCKT1 (Peters version), and ROCKT2 (Labaree version) in Ahl's book, 101 Basic Computer Games published by DEC in 1973. Ahl and Steve North converted all three versions to Microsoft BASIC, changed the name to Lunar Lander, and published them in Creative Computing magazine in 1976. They also appeared in an updated version of Ahl's games book simply called BASIC Computer Games published in 1978 which was re-published in 2010.<br/><br/>A text-only version of Lunar Lander, written in BASIC, was included with the eight-inch floppy operating system diskettes for the Datapoint 2200 series in the early 1980s. Playing it required three separate loadings: first the operating system, then BASIC, and then the program itself.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Lunar Lander (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "140028": {"poll": [], "name": "Monopoly: Isle of Anglesey", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Set Collection", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: United Kingdom", "Monopoly"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1603679_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Winning Moves UK Ltd."], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1603679.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Economic", "Negotiation"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "A monopoly (from Greek monos &mu;\u03cc&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf; (alone or single) + polein &pi;&omega;&lambda;&epsilon;\u1fd6&nu; (to sell)) exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity.<br/><br/>Monopoly is a roll-and-move game where players move around the game board buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels.

So real reaction to handling and flight simulation were primary targets of this simulator.  In addition, an important part of the development of this program has been the simulation of both thermal and ridge lift used by glider pilots as the only &quot;engine&quot; to keep their planes in the air allowing them to cover very long distances, attain great heights and stay aloft for extended amounts of time.<br/><br/>Sailors of the Sky was developed to be comparable in quality with other simulators in the market.  To attain this a good virtual cockpit which is easily controlled with your mouse provides a natural means for &quot;looking&quot; around outside your cockpit in any direction.  In addition, a high degree of realism is obtained using different external views, aircraft shadows, glass cockpit reflections for faraway gliders, clouds, and cloud shadows are built into the program.<br/><br/>Other Remarkable Features Include:<br/><br/><br/>     Flying: Your plane answers to your action. As with a normal glider, coordinated use of the rudder is very important. The program also allows Wing Slips to be used when approaching the runway and can be executed very realistically.<br/>     Views: A careful selection of textures will allow you to enjoy the blue and green colors of Austria, the greens and reds of Africa, or the browns and yellows of Southern Spain.<br/>     Playing: Whether you are learning to fly under the constraints of club rules or competing against your colleagues in a World Championship, your skillfulness as a pilot will be put to the test.<br/>     Learning: The simulation is formulated according to the laws of physics and flight.  Thus, to do your best you should know your glider's performance capabilities, it's Polar, and how to obtain the best use of it.<br/><br/><br/>Sound good?  You bet it is!  Don't believe it?

The remaining picture cards form a face-down stack at the center of the table. The stack with the 24 face-down letter cards is given to the game master, oldest player, or is passed from one player to the next each turn.<br/>The game master (or one of the players) looks at the top letter card and reads the sound. Each player can now discard one of their picture cards if it matches the sound from the letter card. For example, if the letter card is &quot;SCH&quot;, the picture cards showing a key, (&quot;Schl&uuml;ssel&quot;), pig (&quot;Schwein&quot;) or frog (&quot;Frosch&quot;) can be discarded. A player who doesn't have a matching card has to draw one from the draw deck.

Good Luck!<br/><br/>AIDLER-14 pits players in a unique mining mission where the ultimate goal is to acquire the greatest amount of resources, making the most efficient use of available mining tools and techniques that are available through the use of the mining assistance cards.  Abilities range from advanced movements on the asteroid surface to being able to double and even triple your teams mining production for the turn.  Your mining team has 3 workers which you deploy to either explore and uncover new resources to be mined, mine resources that have already been discovered, or process raw mined materials into processed goods that will save weight and space on the Earth return vehicle for the trip home.

The goal of the game is simple, keep your family alive and be the lone survivors of the cataclysmic disasters.<br/><br/>Each player is the head of a household trying to survive an onslaught of disasters. Every round you must decide how many of your family members will go out searching for supplies, and how many will stay sheltered. Family members who are sheltered, are safe from disasters. Those that go out, might not come back. Next you draw 1 card from any area pile of your choice for each unsheltered family member and place them into your hand. After you've drawn your cards, you take care of your upkeep by discarding 1 food card and 1 water card. If you can't, then you lose a family member to starvation or dehydration.<br/><br/>Once each player has taken a turn, the last player chooses a disaster card from the disaster deck of their choice. The red ones are the worst.  The disasters effect everyone at the same time. In order to survive the effects, you need to use the surplus cards you've collected in your hand. For example: The Oil Crisis Disaster card is drawn. It takes 1 shelter and 1 food away from everyone, or else you lose 1 family member. In my hand I have 2 Waters, 1 Food, a Generator and a Gas Mask. I will discard my food and generator to survive the disaster.<br/><br/>After everyone has dealt with the disaster, the next round begins starting with the player to the left of the person who just drew the disaster.

In the container you have trail where you put your letter tiles to make words. And when the trail is full (something like 15 tiles), the first used letters drop in to two departments one for vowels and other for consonants.<br/><br/>When you start the game, the first player puts one vowel and one consonant in any order in to the trail and then every player gets six letter tiles to make words. You can choose the distribution of vowels and consonants at the start of the game and always when you refill your tile tray. At the players turn you try to make a word using as many already laid letters in a trail as the first letters of your new word. Rest of your word consists of letters you have in your tray. You just put the letters from your tray to the trail to make a new word. Then you multiply newly added letters with letters you used from the previous ones and that makes your points. You fill your hand and then it is the next players turn.<br/><br/>Example: &quot;AUTO&quot; becomes &quot;autoMATIC&quot; (4*5=20 pts.), then &quot;ticK&quot; (3*1), then &quot;tickLE&quot; (4*2) etc.<br/><br/>In a four player game you play to the end of the round, when someone gets total of 60 points. Winner is the player who got the most points. In three player game you play until 80 points and with two players until 100 points. When playing alone you just decide number of rounds and try to make as many points as as you can.<br/><br/>You can play this game as long as you like, because the used letters are dropping back to containers departments, which is the same place where you take the new letter tiles. There is 100 vowel tiles and 100 consonant tiles and six wild tiles in the game. There's quite a few letters missing, that are used in Finnish language.

I'd been running a regular RIFTS campaign for my friends since 1990, and had become obsessed with two things: becoming a writer, and working for Palladium Books. The material in this book (along with the material in its companion, &quot;The Banwok Hunters&quot;) reflect a lot of the original material I wrote and used in my ongoing RIFTS campaign during that time.<br/><br/>I submitted both the manuscript for this book and &quot;The Banwok Hunters&quot; to Palladium Books in the spring of 1995. For a while, it looked like Palladium might publish them. Ultimately, they didn't. I learned a lot from that experience, though, and ultimately it helped me to get published, and to become a better writer.<br/><br/>Both &quot;Demon Heart Falling&quot; and &quot;The Banwok Hunters&quot; were put in storage, and were forgotten. I moved on to other games, and other things.<br/><br/>Fast-forward just about fifteen years later, to the fall of 2009.<br/><br/>While looking for some other old games in the attic, I found one of the original copies of &quot;Demon Heart Falling&quot; - probably the only copy still in existence. I'd printed some copies of it for my friends way back in the day, complete with a cover and comb binding. I'd assumed that all copies - including my own - were long-lost to the ravages of time. Wrong. Here was the last copy, staring me in the face.<br/><br/>So I re-read it. And liked it.<br/><br/>It's not the greatest book in the world, I'II be honest. For that matter, it's probably not good. It's decent. It's an excellent reflection of the author I was back then - raw, hungry, passionate, and practically exploding with ideas. It lacks a lot of the polish and refinement needed from a more experienced writer, which could've made it into something far better than what it was. But it's not terrible. It's just a glimpse at the author I was, and the author I would become.<br/><br/>So I present it to you, for your enjoyment. If you can use any of this stuff in your own RIFTS game, awesome. Let me know about it. If not ... well, I hope you enjoy what you read, and it at least makes you smile.<br/><br/>Warts, flaws and all, I'm proud of this one. It told me that I could be a writer.<br/><br/>"}, "140234": {"rpgartist": ["Jonathan Day"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Banwok Hunters", "rpgdesigner": ["Mike Ferguson", "Eric Mee", "Rich Zeitler"], "rpgproducer": ["Mike Ferguson"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1608965.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Rifts Earth"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy", "Science Fiction (Post Apocalypse)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpg": ["Rifts"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Dimension Books"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1608965_t.png", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>&quot; The Banwok Hunters&quot; is a sourcebook intended for the RIFTS roleplaying game.<br/><br/>It's also a snapshot of one of the happiest parts of my life.<br/><br/>I ran a regular RIFTS campaign between 1990 and 1996.

For twenty years there was conflict, blood and debris filled the land until one day it all fell silent, no one today knows what truly happened but there were celebrations across all the kingdoms. The aftermath of the war left the seas inaccessible to anyone, raging torrents of storms and seas prevent any ship from sailing to or from the land, the continent shuddered and shifted creating unexplained volcanoes, nothing was spared in the elements mournful wake. A new reform was made so that no war so destructive should ever be brought forth again. To uphold this reform Guilds were created, these guilds are there to keep the balance and to this day still hold great influence across the continent. Many have found honor and glory where others have found wealth and great knowledge. The world turns and now, seven hundred and seventy eight years later things begin to stir in the great forests, dark hearts leak out of the pores of shadows and even magic turns and rebels against itself.

All manuscripts agree on its eternal sleep and they all tell that the beast will wake up one day, shaking the city from its muddy roots, smashing the vitrified stilts on which the city stands, and crashing it into the seething sea where the monster will rise. The ancients say, however, that there will be signs; it is written that the Venetians will feel the tremors, that they would therefore save themselves from the monster, who will recover his freedom by plunging into the waves a deserted city.<br/><br/>But there were no signs. What ancients did not know is that the Leviathan is not alive. For centuries, the city lived and prospered on the back of a corpse. That corpse, though, is now awakening &ndash; and with it the dead arise from the lagoon...<br/><br/>In the cooperative game Carnival Zombie, players lead a group of characters who are fleeing on terra firma from the terror that has emerged from the lagoon of Venice. This group of characters must make its way through hordes of rotting &quot;Infected&quot; to leave the city, and players need to rush as the Leviathan upon which the foundations of Venice were built is awakening.

Players will collect cards and treasure, move guards, and hide within the city of Constantinople until they find their time to strike. Combat is handled through cardplay, and the player who best manages his cards will have the best chance at victory.<br/><br/>At the start of each player's turn, he draws an Event card, which can spawn new targets in the outer city, move guards, or allow you to find a tunnel to another section of the city. Moving guards is a great way to get them away from you and place them near your opponents. Targets cannot be assassinated while a guard is nearby, but fortunately the guards can be dispatched if need be.<br/><br/>Cards in hand drive the action, but they are also your hit points. If you run out of cards in hand, you die &mdash; but just like in a video game, you will soon respawn at your starting area. Moving and attacking targets (or your fellow players) requires playing cards, so doing too much all at once can be risky. Couple that with trying to avoid the guards and you are in for a tension-filled game of cat-and-mouse. To replenish your hand, complete objectives on your movement cards or hide. Hiding in the outer city is easy and grants you lots of extra cards. When you enter the merchant district or the area around the palace, there just aren&rsquo;t as many places to hide and you will not draw many cards.<br/><br/>Combat is handled through cardplay. No dice are required, although a six-sided die is included to resolve some guard movement. Do you save your best cards for movement or to go in for the kill? He who risks the most has the chance for the most reward!<br/><br/>"}, "140388": {"poll": [], "name": "Fighters Club", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Martial Arts"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["KOG Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["KOG Games"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Fighters Club is an online fighting game in which you control a character in an arena that may contain as few as one other opponent but as many as 5.

The full game featured thirteen maps and featured both a single player and a multiplayer mode, which supported up to twenty-four players and three teams. Afterwards, a multiplayer demo with only the Antarctica map was released.<br/>The game itself was focused on firearms in a special forces setting, with a mixture of military and counterterrorist type themes. The game featured a large number of firearms, numbering in the dozens and including a wide selection of handguns and rifles. Many of them could be further customized as well. For example, a C-mag and silencer could be added. The multi-player offered different classes (Reconnaissance, Commando, Medic, Heavy Weapons, Sniper, Demolitions and Intelligence Officer) with extra abilities and class-specific weapons. All classes could use all other classes' firearms (by picking them up off the battlefield), but each class might not have the same level of skill with a given weapon (such as less precision).<br/>Other features existed as well, including a life-sign tracking device, as well other game items like tear gas grenades, smoke grenades and medkit.

It uses the Swords &amp; Wizardry Core Rules. Swords &amp; Wizardry is a &quot;retro-clone&quot; game, mirroring the rules of the original 1974 fantasy roleplaying game written by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. This original edition, which consisted of three booklets and four supplements, is often referred to as &quot;0e.&quot; There are actually two versions of Swords &amp; Wizardry: the WhiteBox version uses only material from the first three booklets, and the Core Rules (used here) make use of some, but by no means all, of the material from the four supplements.<br/><br/>Background<br/><br/>For centuries, out in the wilderness beyond civilization's reach, there has stood an enigmatic tower known as the Spire of Iron and Crystal. It is a bizarre and ancient structure; four massive, eggshaped crystals are mounted into a twisting, ornate structure of rounded metal girders, one crystal at the top and the other three mounted lower down. Moving lights seen inside the huge crystals suggest that they are hollow and even inhabited, but no one has ever discovered the secret of how to enter them. This is not surprising, for the tower is located on a broad stone ledge halfway up a sheer cliff face, the glassy walls of which have killed several adventurers who attempted to climb down to the tower almost a hundred feet below.<br/><br/>Over the course of the last few months, with considerable effort and some highly questionable methods, the adventurers have assembled quite a bit of information about the Spire - things not widely known, even among the wisest sages of the lands. Most importantly, they believe they know how to enter the structure safely. Once per year, the sun shines through an ancient runestone at the edge of the great cliff upon which the Spire stands; for a period of three days when the stars are aligned with the runestone, an invisible causeway manifests, connecting the highest crystal of the tower with the edge of the cliff, far above. According to the party's information, it is only during the first hour of evening, while the sun is visible through the runestone that the ramp remains in being.<br/><br/>This information promises to allow the party access to the riches of the tower, which are lavishly described in rumor and lore. They have equipped a small expedition and made their way through the trails of the wild borderlands to their goal: the tower and its still-unplundered riches.<br/><br/>"}, "140426": {"rpgdesigner": ["James Boney", "Skeeter Green"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Dread Saecaroth  (Pathfinder)", "rpgartist": ["Rowena Aitken", "Robert Altbauer", "MKultra Studio"], "rpgproducer": ["Greg A.

No stranger to werewolf infestations, you know that the best thing to do is to start lynching suspects.<br/><br/>You no sooner get started on this project when you discover that there's a problem &ndash; Werewolves have also infiltrated your team of inquisitors! Now you're in a serious pickle: You need to save the village while thwarting the werewolves whom are working alongside you...<br/><br/>Ultimate Werewolf: Inquisition is a standalone game of deduction, secrets and betrayal with no elimination.

To do this, each round players either use the power of a villager's hut or take two votes from the supply.

In desperate attempt to turn back time and unite the eastern bloc the long prepared offensive into western Europe is launched.  A critical element for success is to be able to interdict the American reinforcements over the Atlantic to its NATO allies. That job belongs to the submarines of the arctic fleet in Murmansk. But they need air support and support from surface vessels as well and Murmansk is too far away from the North Atlantic seas to provide that support. In order to seize air fields and naval bases on the Norwegian west coast as fast as possible an invasion of Finland and Sweden is launched at the same time  as the Norwegian border is crossed on the Nordkapp to outflank the Norwegian easily defensible terrain along the northern coast.  Neutrality will not protect Sweden this time. But maybe an army of 600 000 trained men and 600 tanks will?<br/>This game deals with the southern part  of the Soviet operation against Sweden, the invasion of Sk&aring;ne. The well trained paratroopers of the VDV and the equally well trained Baltic marines land to face the bulk of the Swedish armoured brigades supported by infantry and artillery in terrain ideally suited for armoured units.  Will the Swedish built  turret less tank Strv 103 meet the expectations, though twenty years in service now, or will it be up to the British built Centurions, with more than thirty years in service,  to destroy the invaders? <br/>With X pages of rules, XXX counters X maps and  13 scenarios the game is designed to help understanding of the challenges of the Swedes as well as those of the Warpac. While gameplay is designed to be fast and easy with command and control issues being in the centre of the design the optional rules allow for deeper study into logistics and recovery. Units are platoons and each game turn equals one hour . Hexes are 500 meters across.<br/><br/>Hit fast! Hit hard! centres on the 7th armoured brigade, PB7 Malm&ouml;brigaden, and its hypothetical but well planned and trained actions around Ystad on the Scanian south coast.  Equipped with Strv 103C, the upgraded version of the famous &ldquo;S&rdquo; tank was the cutting edge of the XI. Division responsible for repelling or at least fixing an invasion  aimed at Ystad or Trelleborg. While PB7 might be superior in fire power to the air assault and naval infantry units it initially will encounter these are the elite units of the Soviet union. If the soviets seize a working harbour mechanised units with T-72M1 tanks are sure to pour in fast.  You will also see  parts of two different Swedish types of infantry brigades as well as territorial defence units  and the 12th independent mechanised battalion with Strv 102R, partly upgraded Centurions, and motorised rifle companies in trucks rather than Pbv 302 infantry fighting vehicles.<br/><br/>"}, "140460": {"rpgartist": ["John M.
