Tembisa, the treasure hunt<br/>2. Tembisa, the African farms<br/>3. Tembisa Memory<br/><br/>The game materials consist of 1 die, 4 wooden pawns and 56 playing cards. Besides a startcard and finishcard (showing the treasure in a cave), the cards show different situations you come across (e.g. a hungry lion, a wild river, a giant snake, friendly villagepeople). Each card also shows a negative number, STOP, or 1 or 2 dice to roll.<br/><br/>1. Tembisa, the treasure hunt<br/>A line is laid out of the playing cards. All cards, except for the start and endcard are placed facedown. A player rolls the die and moves his or her pawn accordingly. If the card where the pawn ends is not face upwards yet, do it now. In either case: this card shows a picture of what you met, together with a it's effect on your pawn: move it accordingly. (The number of places shown backwards, STOP or roll 1 or 2 extra dice.) The card where pawn ends up has no further effect for that players turn.<br/>When six uncovered cards are in a uninterrupted row, this region is deemed fully explored. Only the positive cards keep their effect.<br/>The player to reach the endcard showing the treasure first, wins the game.<br/><br/>2. Tembisa, the African farms<br/>For this variant, the start and end card are not used.<br/>Players try to build the biggest farms. A farm is build by placing a -1 card on the table. This farm can be enlarged by placing a -2, -3, ... on top in order.<br/>A player is allowed more than one farm, all starting with a -1.<br/>The STOP and 1 and 2 dice cards are used for protecting and stealing cards from the other players: to attack play a stop card on anothers farm, depending on further STOP or dice cards, a dice duel commits between attacker and defender. If the attacker wins he or she robs a die roll of cards from the top of the attacked farm. These must be used immediatly to enlarge his or her owns farm(s) or be discarded.<br/>A STOP card can also be used to protect one farm. When placed on top a farm of your own, that farm is protected against robbings. However, you cannot enlarge it anymore either.<br/>Players hold six cards in their hands, drawing 1 extra at the start of ones turn. This can be a card from the drawpile, or the top one of the (open) discard pile.<br/>At the end of ones turn cards are discarded or taken to fill up to 6 cards.<br/>STOP and dice cards are removed from play once used. <br/>Gameplay continues till there are no more cards in the discard and drawpiles. (The discardpile is reshuffled and becomes the new drawpile each time.) Then the values of the farms are added for each player, the player with the largest farm is the winner! (Just count as if each card had a positive number, instead of a negative.) Cards held in hands don't count.<br/><br/>3. Tembisa Memory<br/>A variant on ye old Memory. The goal is to make pairs of cards. The STOP cards count as jokers, it can form a set with any other card. However, two STOP cards are not a set!<br/>The 1 die and 2 dice cards are also jokers, but also give a number of bonus points at the end of the game: roll one or two dice accordingly for the number of bonus points.<br/>Scoring: The values of the couples are counted, dice bonusses are added.

The game includes a variety of different bug types (as units), each serving in a different combat role (e.g., heavy infantry, archer, support, etc). As the title is intended to appeal to casual gamers (among others), turns are relatively quick and combats are small in scale.<br/><br/>In contrast to many turn-based games where either an entire side moves at once or individuals move according to some initiative value, units in Band of Bugs take turns. When sides have an equal number of units, each side moves a single unit at a time before ceding control to the other side. When one side has more units than the other, that side takes a proportionally greater number of moves at a time, e.g. two moves to every one of the opposition when one side has twice as many units as the other. The same unit may not be moved more than once per full turn, with a full turn ending after all units have acted.

When the boat snags something in the overhead map, the perspective changes to a side-view. The player's boat releases a diver who battles various undersea threats such as jellyfish, rays, and smaller sharks. Occasionally, Jaws will appear on the map in the form of its familiar dorsal fin breaking the water's surface. If players collide with Jaws' dorsal fin, they can momentarily control their boat in the side-view encounter in an attempt to attack Jaws with depth charges. Jaws will always collide with the boat and release the diver into the water. Jaws will also appear after a brief moment if the player snags something in the overhead map with Jaws nearby.<br/><br/>Items encountered include crabs (increases movement speed of the diver), stars (bonus points), and conch shells which are used as currency in this game. Equipment and upgrades are purchased by alternating between two ports on the map. The first port visit gives the player a receiver, which tracks the location of Jaws relative to the boat on the overhead map; the faster it beeps, the closer Jaws is to the player. Future visits to ports afterwards increases overall attack power against Jaws. Touching a hostile sea creature during the side view undersea encounters will kill players and penalize them with a power level drop by 1 (if they had upgraded their attack power), the loss of the tracking device, the loss of half of the conch shells accumulated to that point, and complete health replenishment for Jaws.<br/><br/>Killing a specific number of smaller sharks will trigger a bonus game. In this bonus game, an airplane travels back and forth in a side-view perspective and drops cannonballs on jellyfish, which assume formations and movement patterns similar to the enemies in the Challenge Stage of Galaga. Players can adjust the speed of the airplane, depending on what direction it is traveling. The player is rewarded the number of conch shells equivalent to the number of jellyfish killed divided by 3, rounded down. Hitting all the jellyfish awards 10,000 bonus points. An extra life is awarded for every 30,000 points.<br/><br/>The player can also find a submarine which appears at random places in the game map. The submarine is an upgrade with two weapons (torpedoes and depth charges) and much less inertia than the diver. The submarine is fragile, however, and one collision with an enemy will destroy it and release the diver (although this will not kill the diver).<br/><br/>Once Jaws' health has been reduced in the side view encounter, the game changes to a &quot;first person&quot; view of the player's boat. Players are given three charges for their strobe device to force Jaws to breach the water's surface. Timing is essential in order to force Jaws to breach at the proper distance from the bow of the boat. Players can also jut the bow of their boat forward at any time. In order to fully defeat Jaws, the player must jab it with the boat's bow at the proper distance when it breaches from the strobe device. This can be quite difficult and require much patience. Jaws makes random movements backward, forward and side-to-side which makes for a hard final kill.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Jaws (video game),&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "86140": {"rpgartist": ["J.

Originally Developed by Pseudo Interactive for the PC, it is a vehicular combat racing game. It features destructible environments and (in certain races) a mode called &quot;Unwreck&quot; which rewinds time if the player makes a mistake and wants to try again.<br/><br/>In Full Auto, there are four vehicle classes. Each has its own abilities, strengths and weaknesses. There is Class A, which are faster, but have less durability than their counterparts. Class B is the middle class of vehicles having a fair amount of speed, and decent durability. The slow, and highly durable class is Class C. A fourth class, Class S, is home to the &quot;ultimate&quot; class where its vehicle is very powerful, fast and durable. Note that in online play all players, regardless of how far they have gotten in the career mode, have access to all vehicles in whatever class the host of the room determines. However tuneable weapons are not permitted on Live play until the gamer has unlocked them from the career mode.<br/><br/>The weapons of Full Auto are mounted on the vehicles, and have unlimited ammunition, but require a cooldown period if fired too quickly. The weapons become active after approximately 10 seconds of racing into the game.<br/><br/>Weapon presets come in three different varieties: front-mounted, rear-mounted, or variable (rear and front mounted). Weapons also have the ability to change levels which increase damage. Levels range from 1 through 3 with 3 being the highest. The only drawback to raising a weapon's level, is that the other weapon is decreased in level. For example, rear-mounted grenades can be upgraded to level 3, but the front-mounted shotgun is dropped to a level 1. This balances front and rear weapon strength, so no car can totally dominate another.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Full Auto,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "86153": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Graham Lipscomb"], "poll": [], "name": "Juggler", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic904972_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Graham's Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic904972.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Word Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "From the publisher's website: &quot;JUGGLER is a word game for 2 to 6 players, played on a table with a special deck of 70 alphabetic cards (one letter per card, with a score value - E is worth 1, J is worth 8 ...etc).

When play comes back round to the declarer, all the players place their hand of cards onto the table, announcing their word for that round and scoring the total face value of all the cards they have used for their word (MINUS the total face value of any remaining unused in their hand).

There are squares in the colors of each of the players (white and blue), as well as 5 neutral squares. Given that there are less squares for the blue player (8 versus white's 12), the blue player always gets to play the first move.<br/><br/>"}, "86172": {"poll": [], "name": "Formula One 06", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Scandinavian PlayStation 2 Platinum edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic845015.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Formula One"], "videogametheme": ["Driving"], "videogamegenre": ["Racing", "Sports"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["SCE Studio Liverpool"], "videogamefranchise": ["Platinum Range (Best Selling PlayStation Games, PAL)"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2"], "videogamehonor": ["2006 Game Critics Best Racing Game of the Year Nominee"], "average": "8", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic845015_t.jpg", "description": "The fifteenth game of the official Formula One video games series.

This was the bustling time of the year when the Christmas workers needed to stop working for a moment and come together to discuss how Christmas was unraveling. The meeting attendees arrived as planned at Santa's home. They enjoyed appetizers and engaged in fun Christmas trivia questions while waiting for the meeting to begin. They had fun with an exciting game of 'What Christmas Thing am I' followed by a challenging game of Christmas Taboo. Mrs. Claus served a delicious dinner along with an entertaining Christmas Scramble challenge. The meeting was productive and the Christmas spirit was soaring high until to everyone's shock...a murder occurred! The Christmas characters all rallied together to figure out whodunit before this scandalous murder ruined Christmas! After everyone accused who they believed the murderer was...everyone came clean with their involvement in the crime and...the murderer confessed! While the group awaited the North Pole P.D. to arrive and arrest the accused, the group played a fun game of Christmas Charades.

She pressed on.<br/><br/>At the center of chamber she found what she was looking for. The stone was a ruby or red sapphire a foot across set into an obsidian pedestal. Golden flecks sparked within the gem in the light of Khepri&rsquo;s torch. She paused for a moment. Her imagination turned the gemstone into a great crimson sky filled with golden stars.<br/><br/>Gently she raised the priceless stone from its resting place. There are few things Khepri Satisis would ever regret as deeply.<br/><br/>A soft cracking, like that of an egg being slowly pulled open, rang through the air. This sound was followed by the distinctive ring of sundering stone and shattering glass.<br/><br/>Something was waking up.<br/><br/>The dragons keep their secrets close. Among these are shameful secrets, like the forbidden half-dragonkin. Others are relics from a bygone age. These are the forgotten, failed attempts at breeding a new servitor race as their greatest age drew to a painful close.<br/><br/>Someone or something has awakened both these things in a long-forgotten mountain cavern. Once released, these horrors have no interest in returning to their slumber.<br/><br/>Features: <br/><br/>     The Forgotten: Three new hybrids of modern animal and dinosaur, created during the fall of the ancient Dragon Empires. Recently wakened from their sleep, the Ozan, R&rsquo;zaous and Skored are free to rampage across the world. <br/>     Half-Dragonkin Template: Of all the dark secrets of dragonkind, the fact that dragonkin may breed with other species just as pureblooded dragons can is the most closely guarded. The half-dragonkin template allows for halfbreeds of behir, chimera, dragon turtle, dragonne, jabberwock*, pseudodragon and wyvern. Includes example monsters for each dragonkin species.<br/>     The Hyeneel: A prototype of the forgotten, this horror fuses the traits of hyenas and electric eels.<br/>     New Magic Weapon Abilities: Seven new magic weapon abilities discovered during the unearthing of the forgotten&rsquo;s tomb: Arrowbane, banishing, chaotic surge, chaotic burst, demolishing, impact and screaming for use in both traditional and modern games. <br/>     Multi-genre Support: Background information and story suggestions for quickly adapting the included creatures to modern fantasy, modern science-fiction, post-apocalyptic and space opera settings.<br/>     Variant Rules Support: Like all Octavirate products, Octavirate Presents: The Forgotten provides quick-reference variant rules support for each creature Including: wounds/vitality, defense bonus, armor as damage reduction, modern/3.0 damage reduction, sanity loss, taint, magic rating, spell points, honor and reputation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "86201": {"rpgartist": ["Greg Sepelak", "Ronald Smith", "Trent Troop"], "rpg": ["d20 Modern", "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "poll": [], "name": "Collectabeast!", "rpgdesigner": ["Ronald Smith", "Trent Troop"], "rpgproducer": ["Ronald Smith", "Trent Troop"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic837191.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy", "Modern", "Science Fiction"], "rpgpublisher": ["Octavirate Entertainment"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Octavirate Presents"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic837191_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Monsters are defined by the generation that observes them. For some, &quot;monster&quot; calls to mind the image of rubbery leviathans and shuffling black-and-white horrors. For others, the word &quot;monster&quot; means dragons, demons, orcs, ogres and all the myriad terrors that lair in the shadows of worlds both contemporary and anachronistic. But for the younger generation, more than ever, monsters are not things of terror.<br/><br/>For to some &quot;monster&quot; means &quot;cute&quot;.<br/><br/>Wide-eyed, curious and adorable, a whole new generation of monsters has grown up with a whole new generation of gamers. But this breed of monster is the domain of collectable cards and video games. These creatures have rarely stepped forward into the realm of tabletop gaming.<br/><br/>That is, rarely until now.<br/><br/>Ready or not, here come the Collectabeasts and their rivals, the perpetually mutating Databeasts. They stand ready to invade your campaign world or to establish their own. The role these creatures play is up to you. They might be the core of a fantasy concept that stands to bridge the younger and older gaming generations. They might serve as antagonists in an ongoing campaign to defend the world from an invasion of bizarrely unreal monsters. They can be heroes or villains, pets or companions, natural or unnatural.<br/><br/>The choice, as always, is yours.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>     The Collectabeast template turns any monster into a cute collectable-card-style creature ready for combat and mischief. 13 sample collectabeasts demonstrate the nuances of the template and provide ready-to-use beasties for your campaign. Not out to catch &quot;em all? Variant rules allow for the creation of living cartoons, juvenile monsters and more using this template.<br/>     The Databeast template creates binary monsters from normal creatures that travel from the world of conceptualized ideas to the physical world and back. 2 sample monsters stand ready to do battle.<br/>     The Databeast Hero Class: allows you to play as a databeast. Gain the ability to take on new battle forms as your character progresses and do battle with the aid of your humanoid partner.<br/>     Two new items allow you to capture collectabeasts or summon them to do battle.<br/>     Three new feats. Gain an extra advantage with announced attacks, absorb your less powerful NPC partners into your body and use your words to assist your companions with these new feats, usable in any campaign.<br/>     New Locale: Explore DataCrux, the home plane of the databeasts.<br/>     Our biggest Alternate Genre Section Yet provides multiple options for incorporating these monsters into your campaign no matter what setting you are utilizing. As an added bonus, Octavirate Presents Volume 5 is forwards compatible with the upcoming ExorSystems Inc campaign setting.<br/>     Giant Level Adjustment Chart: provides base level adjustments for over 600 SRD monsters from both traditional fantasy, psionic and modern settings.

The player can choose between Cody, a street brawler who fights using a self-made martial art combining Karate and Boxing; Guy, an agile master of Ninjutsu; or Haggar, a former professional wrestler. The three main characters retain almost all of their abilities from the arcade game, with some aesthetic differences.<br/><br/>The game introduces a leveling system in which the player gains experience points by defeating enemies. The number of experience points awarded after defeating an enemy is depended on the finishing move used by the player, with stronger moves giving more points. After accumulating a certain amount of experience points, the player will move to the next level, increasing their attack power and maximum vitality. There are six skill levels in total: Cody and Guy both begin the game at the first skill level, while Haggar begins at Level 3. When the player character reaches Level 4, they will receive an additional special attack which can be performed by rapidly pressing the directional pad left or right and the attack button at the same time. The new move the player gets varies between each character: Cody gains the &quot;Tornado Sweep&quot; energy projectile attack, Guy gets the &quot;Tornado Kick&quot;, and Haggar's extra move is the &quot;Running Clothesline&quot; (also known as the &quot;Scramble Haggar Press&quot;).<br/><br/>Power-up items are also featured, which includes vitality-restoring food items, extra lives, and even additional chances to continue after a game over. Weapons can also be obtained, but unlike the arcade version, the weapon the player can obtain are dependent on the character. Cody will get a knife, Guy can uses a set of shurikens, and Haggar will obtain an over-sized mallet.<br/><br/>The game consists of five stages, as well as two bonus rounds, where the player will encounter child-like counterparts of the Mad Gear members from the original game, including bosses such as Damnd (renamed Thrasher in the English localization), Sodom (Katana), and Abigail.

Instead of rolling the die to determine how far you move, the roll determines which deck of cards you draw from:<br/><br/>1 Job Performance<br/>2 Education and Experience<br/>3 Misfortune<br/>4 Personal Life<br/>5 Connections<br/>6 Fortune<br/><br/>And the card determines your move, usually by giving you a choice.  For example, here is a card from the &quot;Personal Life&quot; deck: &quot;You suddenly get hit with two paternity suits.  Collect (2) enemychips and move back (3) or pay $2500.&quot;  Here's one from &quot;Connections&quot;: &quot;Your boss' spouse takes a liking to you at a company picnic.  Move up (2) or collect $500 and two friendchips.&quot;<br/><br/>Most turns you'll have to make a decision as to how to best balance your forward progress with your money, friends, and enemies.  Friend chips are awarded for various &quot;friendly&quot; events, and Enemy chips are earned for all the people you had to step on to raise yourself up.  Friendchips can be turned into $250 each if you can't otherwise make loan payments, or they can be used to move up one extra space.  Enemy chips can be bought off for $500, and you can't enter the CEO's office (and win the game) unless you have more friendchips than enemychips.  You also must enter the CEO's office by exact count, so it helps to have friendchips to adjust you movement as needed.<br/><br/>In addition, certain squares landed on indicate that a card from the &quot;Outside Influence&quot; deck is drawn.  These cards affect all players.  These events may refer to the department indicated on the board spaces.  The departments are &quot;Sales,&quot; &quot;Accounting,&quot; &quot;Data Processing,&quot; &quot;Manager,&quot; etc.  A card from the Outside Influence deck is: &quot;A new simulator increases the productivity of the Technical Department.

Once the H5N1 zombie virus spread and the zombie population dominated the living within Sunnyville, the zombies staged a revolt and took over the government. The Center for Disease Control, hearing of this epidemic centered in Sunnyville, quarantined the town and the U.S. Government threatened to 'wipe out' the population of zombies to prevent further spreading of this viral nightmare. But the citizens of the newly-formed Zombie Town weren't the stereotypical aggressive zombies portrayed in movies, television and comic books. The citizens of Zombie Town were simply dead and decomposing but still the same as before - upstanding citizens! But with one gruesome exception: the virus gave them an intense craving for living human flesh! Because a mandatory vaccine against the H5N1 zombie virus was given to the human population outside of Zombie Town and the epidemic ceased to exist, human rights activists caught wind of the situation in Sunnyville (aka: Zombie Town) and formed the Save a Zombie Alliance. Millions banded together across the country and persuaded the United States government to sign an unprecedented peace treaty with the zombies. Ashes, the self acclaimed Emperor of Zombie Town, represented the zombies and outlined the truce with the U.S. President. The major clause in the treaty was that zombies would not cross the borders of Zombie Town unless on an approved journey by the U.S. President and they would never hunt living humans for food outside of their borders. Because there were extensive warning signs posted for miles surrounding Zombie Town's borders, there was an addendum in favor of the zombies that if a living human ended up inside the borders of Zombie Town, they were 'fair game' to be hunted, captured and on a zombie's dinner table. Ashes set forth the laws of Zombie Town and the treaty was to be signed by both Ashes and the U.S. President within 24 hours. The citizens were happy to be at peace with the United States Government. Thankfully, they discovered they could sustain themselves by eating pumpkins but pumpkins didn&rsquo;t quite satisfy their appetite for living human flesh. Suppressing their cravings led to increasing irritability and with frustrations escalating in Zombie Town, Ashes knew s/he had to pump up the morale of the citizens. Leary of an impending civil unrest, s/he scheduled the Undead Festival which was a massive town-wide celebration with delicious pumpkin-inspired food, rockin' music and fun zombie games.

The management of the Chamber of Screams decided to reward the employees with a mini-Halloween celebration held during normal business hours in the employee break room. The Haunted House typically shut down each night for a brief time period so the employees could get a break and straighten up their haunted scenes. It was rumored that management probably did this so the line of customers outside would build up and The Chamber of Screams would look twice as popular. Regardless of the reason for the break, the employees looked forward to the upcoming treat during their next shift at work. The Halloween Celebration kicked off without a hitch as the frightening cast members piled into the employee break area and enjoyed delicious creepy appetizers and eerie drinks while quizzing each other on challenging spooky trivia. They played a few hilarious games such as So You Think You Can Dance, the Creepy Disguise Challenge and the Horrific Rap Contest and then mingled about as they caught up on the latest gossip about the haunted house employees. A delicious dinner was served while the celebrators played the amusing Marvelous Movie Challenge. After dinner, some of the cast members engaged in the Writers, Producers, Directors and Actors challenge as a select few filtered back towards their scary scenes in the haunted house to get ready for the reopen. Unexpectedly, the lights went out and within a few minutes...to everyone's horror...a dead body was discovered! The employees scrambled to figure out whodunit before the police arrived. During the intense investigation, the employees took a break from the stress of it all and had a blast with the What Scary Thing Am I game and the Boisterous Balloon Battle. One of the cast members called in a quick favor from a police officer that quickly lifted fingerprints off the murder weapon so the investigators could be sure of their opinions of whodunit. Once everyone was ready, they took turns accusing who they believed the murderer was. Then, one by one, each person confessed to their involvement, if any, and the murder confessed! After a crazy escape attempt, the employees topped off their Halloween Celebration with the Happy Halloween Memory Game, the Chamber of Screams Charades and the Frightening Film Festival. Overall, it was a night at the Chamber of Screams that absolutely nobody will ever forget!<br/><br/>"}, "86320": {"poll": [], "name": "Pandemonium On Plymouth Rock", "playingtime": "240", "minplayers": "7", "boardgamemechanic": ["Partnerships", "Role Playing", "Storytelling"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Cities: Plymouth"], "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic839864_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["MyMysteryParty.com"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic839864.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": ["Murder/Mystery", "Party Game"], "age": "13", "minplaytime": "240", "description": "From the publishers website:<br/><br/>A fun family Thanksgiving Day Murder Mystery Party for 7 to 10 guests, ages 13+.

The game was designed by Drew Pictures and distributed by Spectrum Holobyte, with Peter Stone of Xorcist creating the soundtrack as well as all sound design.<br/><br/>Set far in the future, the human race is in the middle of a cold war with an alien race called the Thanatosians. During a target practice by an Earth fleet that will destroy an uninhabited planet, the heavy destroyer Jeremiah O'Brien is infected with an unknown virus that mutates the crew. No longer recognized due to the changes in their DNA, the O'Brien's security robot, simply known as &quot;the Ship's Defender&quot;, assumes they are invaders and kills them. An apparent technical malfunction has caused the O'Brien&rsquo;s computer to believe that it was in a real life war situation, and select the planet Calliope as a target for destruction. Like all of the human fleet's Cerberus-class destroyers, the O'Brien carries a weapon known as &quot;Iron Helix&quot;, which is capable of destroying all life on a planet in a single act. An attack on Calliope, a peaceful Thanatosian planet, would cause the war to go &quot;hot&quot;.<br/><br/>The player is onboard the scientific exploration ship Indiana, and is contacted by the Earth's forces in an attempt to stop the O'Brien, as it was the only ship nearby. As the ship is infected with the unknown virus, the player instead remotely-controls a zoological robot that is sent over to explore. As much of the ship's systems are locked out using DNA detectors, the robot must collect uncontaminated samples of the crew's DNA to access different secured areas onboard. The robot can also interface with dataports on the O'Brien to operate its systems, from opening doors to issuing executive commands.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Iron Helix&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "86327": {"rpgartist": ["Robin Elliott"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "War in Midwinter", "rpgdesigner": ["Simon Lucas"], "rpgproducer": ["Kirsty Crabb", "Simon Lucas"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic839918.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Legion Publishing"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Critical Hits"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic839918_t.jpg", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>In War in Midwinter, the characters find themselves embroiled in the climactic part of the struggle for the future of the remote town of Midwinter.

It&rsquo;s cinematic and flexible like its parent, but its goal is to be lighter and faster, keeping the heart of the system&rsquo;s mechanics but streamling the rules.<br/><br/>Pages four and five detail character creation while pages six and seven provide all the needed mechanics to play a complete game. Beyond these four pages are additional rules and options to expand your game.<br/><br/>On pages 8 through 13 are rules that will only come up in some games, vehicles and magic. While 14 through 17 provide GM&rsquo;s with a ready list of NPC&rsquo;s and monsters to populate the game. Pages 18 and 19 provide rule variants to help change up the game to better fit the style of the campaign desired. On pages 20 and 21 the GM will find a little advice on creating the campaign and adapting other OpenD6 materials to their Mini Six games. Starting on page 22 you will find five sample settings that are nearly ready to go as is. Pages 34 and 35 contain a character sheet and the Mini Six cheat sheet containing several useful charts to serve as a handy reference.<br/><br/>What you won&rsquo;t find in ths book are a lot of detailed examples, exhaustive rules to cover every possible scenario, or a large list of modifiers. Instead, we are trusting GM&rsquo;s, with the help of their players, to apply common sense to make the game fun for everyone. Don&rsquo;t slow the game down by wasting time digging for rules that aren&rsquo;t there.

In this manual, the focus is on rowdy, destructive, entertaining, and (mostly) non-fatal brawls. The kind that spring up in the bars, taverns, and inns whenever dwarves or barbarians aren't being watched closely!<br/><br/>"}, "86402": {"poll": [], "name": "Yohoho!

Puzzle Pirates is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Three Rings Design. The player takes the role of a pirate, adventuring on the high seas and pillaging money (&quot;pieces of eight&quot;) from roaming enemy ships (human or computer-controlled). The mechanics of Puzzle Pirates are driven by puzzles. For example, to effectively sail a ship, players must play puzzle games representing work at the sails for speed, pumping bilge water to remove it from the ship, and carpentry to fix any damage the ship may take.<br/><br/>Puzzle Pirates is open-ended and community-driven. Over time, pirates can join a crew, progress in rank within that crew, buy and run sailing vessels and shoppes, and perhaps even become captain of a crew, royalty within a flag (an alliance of crews), or governor of an island. Islands are governed and shoppes are managed exclusively by players. From time to time, players are also called upon to help expand the game, whether it be new puzzles (developed on Game Gardens), island objects to be used on new oceans (servers), or artwork used for a variety of purposes in-game.<br/><br/>Players are encouraged by Three Rings to use pirate-themed words and phrases such as &quot;Yarr!&quot; and &quot;Ahoy there, matey!&quot; instead of &quot;Hi&quot;, etc. and Ocean Masters - the moderators of Puzzle Pirates - use these phrases and more. The tips which appear in the game's News, which is updated regularly, use terms such as &quot;Jackanapes&quot;. As of December 2008, there are 4 million pirates registered to the game.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Yohoho!

At this time, Japan was effectively a group of small states, each ruled by a lord, or Daimyo. Because these states were constantly fighting each other, the period became known as the Sengoku period- meaning &quot;a country at war with itself.&quot;<br/><br/>Conquest of Japan is a game of land conquest. Played on a map of Honshu, Japan's main island, you begin with five cities or towns, as does your opponent. Each of these towns carries an entitlement to a set number of koku - the currency used in Japan to hire warriors. You must use your koku to raise a band of warriors in each town. Each town will have a different army. Then direct your men towards your chosen target city -- or towards one or more enemy armies if you are seeking an early confrontation!<br/><br/>Whenever two sides meet, a battle will be played out using a<br/>unique miniature-style system. The results of this battle will be fed back into the strategic level game. The strategic game is more important than the individual battles for ultimate success -- remember that you can lose a battle but win the war.<br/><br/>"}, "86483": {"videogame": ["The Definitive Wargame Collection", "Twenty Wargame Classics"], "poll": [], "name": "When Two Worlds War", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Amiga", "DOS"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1041539.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Military", "Science Fiction", "Space", "War - Future"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Impressions Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "DOS"], "average": "6", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Impressions Games"], "videogamecompilation": ["The Definitive Wargame Collection", "Twenty Wargame Classics"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1041539_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>When Two Worlds War is a game of strategic interplanetary war between two protagonists.<br/><br/>Players manage their own planets resources, technologies and war production, while transporting their military units to the opposing planet to engage in battle.<br/><br/>Battles may be fought on one's own planet, on the opposing planet or in space inbetween.<br/><br/>"}, "86484": {"poll": [], "name": "Zombie Tide: Road to Hope", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Point to Point Movement"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "average": "1", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Zombies"], "age": "18", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "In Zombie Tide: Road to Hope, players must explore a ruined city, scavenging fuel, food, ammo, and equipment in an attempt to survive roaming zombie hordes and arrive safely at the Military Base where rescue awaits.<br/><br/>Cash in fuel chips to move, spend ammo to fend off zombies, and collect equipment to bolster your attacks and defenses.<br/><br/>Running out of food, ammo, or fuel could be disastrous, as infection sets in, leading to madness and eventual transformation into a zombie!<br/><br/>"}, "86486": {"poll": [], "name": "Delta Force 2", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Massively Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["EN/EU Windows version"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic842599.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Delta Force"], "videogametheme": ["Military"], "usersrated": "9", "videogamedeveloper": ["NovaLogic"], "videogamegenre": ["First Person Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "6.66667", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["NovaLogic"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic842599_t.jpg", "description": "from back of the box<br/><br/>you are part of the best kept secret of the US army: the special elite forces better known under the name delta force. these units where brought to life to fight terrorism anywhere in the world. are you ready for the battle?<br/><br/>"}, "86487": {"poll": [], "name": "Nightmare Creatures", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European PlayStation edition", "North American Nintendo 64 edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic949620.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Nightmare Creatures"], "videogametheme": ["Horror"], "usersrated": "15", "videogamecharacter": ["Banshee", "Hellhound", "Werewolf", "Zombie"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Kalisto Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure", "Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo 64", "PlayStation"], "average": "6.25333", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Activision"], "vgcharacterversion": ["Banshee", "Hellhound", "Werewolf", "Zombie"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic949620_t.jpg", "description": "from back of the box<br/><br/>the scientiest adam crowley has created monsters that made the city london their battling ground. take ignatius or nadia en fight against them in this 3d scout en fight game: maybe even the most horrofiing game ever!<br/><br/>"}, "86488": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Quetzalcoatl", "rpgdesigner": ["Philippe Tromeur"], "rpgproducer": ["Philippe Tromeur"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2375297.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Crime (Conspiracy)", "History (Americas)", "Horror (Supernatural)", "Modern", "Mythology / Folklore", "Occult (Magic)", "Religion"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpg": ["Quetzalcoatl"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2375297_t.png", "description": "From the Game's Introduction:<br/><br/>Les Azt&egrave;ques v&eacute;n&eacute;raient Quetzalcoatl, le Serpent &agrave;

Silvervine is all about you and the character you want to play. Designed to let you build your character and define the way EVERYTHING about them works, the system encourages collaborative play and supports the Game Master and players with a simple to run, easy to improvise, and fun system.<br/><br/>Character Creation<br/>Character creation in Silvervine works on a point buy system. Buy skills, powers, raise your character&rsquo;s attributes, and get just the right mix for your character concept.<br/><br/>Thematics<br/>You&rsquo;ve got total control of how and why your character&rsquo;s stuff works. When you activate your flight power do Dragon Wings grow from your back, erupting in mystic flame? Do you rev up your steampowered jetpack and erupt into the sky? It&rsquo;s all in your hands! Is your sword forged from a single dragonscale, is your mace a giant wrench, is your handgun embedded in your metallic arm? That&rsquo;s up to you!<br/><br/>Cinematics<br/>Just like you have control over the thematics of your powers and equipment, you have cinematic control of your actions. You get to say what happens and how. Your actions are in your descriptions and are as incredible as you want them to be.<br/><br/>Narrative<br/>Silvervine is about stories - the story of the characters, the story the Game Master is crafting, and the collaborative space they come together in. Shared narrative ties it all together and makes the fun. The game system keeps it balanced and fun but the story makes it yours.<br/><br/>"}, "86010": {"poll": [], "name": "Live and Let Die", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["France/UK/Italy/Spain C64 edition", "North American Amiga edition", "UK Amiga edition", "UK Amstrad CPC edition", "UK Atari ST edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic846492.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Ocean / Sea", "Spy / Espionage"], "videogamegenre": ["Racing"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Elite Systems"], "videogamefranchise": ["James Bond"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "Amstrad CPC", "Atari ST", "Commodore 64"], "usersrated": "3", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Domark", "Elite Systems"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic846492_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>&quot;Live and Let Die&quot; is a computer game inspired by the speedboat chase sequence of the James Bond movie.<br/><br/>The game includes 4 missions (Sahara, the Arctic and New Orleans and a practice circuit).

His journey leads him to explore the Tower of Shadar the Thief in the town of Zengara, encounter allies and enemies, and free a mysterious princess.<br/><br/>The game uses a streamlined version of the Fer &amp; Flamme engine: players still manage their adventurer (and later in the game, their party) using icons but the display has been improved, leaving more room for graphics and descriptive text.<br/><br/>"}}
