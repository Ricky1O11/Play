In Battle of Souls you deploy (summon) warriors of different ranks and warrior sects to drain your opponents soul points (life points) and win the game. The theme of the game carries alone with historical warriors such as Samurai, Mongolian, Roman etc..<br/><br/>In Battle of Souls, each player starts with 8000 life points which in our game is referred to as soul points. The objective of the game, or otherwise stated the win condition is to be the first player to reach 16000 soul points.<br/><br/>This is done by dealing damage to your opponent from the attacks of your deployed (summoned) warriors.<br/><br/>Each time your opponent takes damage of any type, including any cost to activate an effect, you gain that much SP (soul points) and vice versa.<br/><br/>This mechanic insures that there will always be a definite victor and never a draw game. <br/>The second win condition is if one player runs out of cards to draw from their decks, they lose the game.<br/><br/>GAME FLOW:<br/>Each player starts the game by drawing 5 cards from their deck to their hand. The first play to take a turn draws one additional card at the beginning of their turn. Each turn the player is able to deploy only one fighter (warrior, elite warrior, warlord, legendary warrior) to their side of the field. The first player to take his/her turn may not attack on that turn. The last player to draw is the first that can attack.<br/>The fighter cards are ranked in the following order, along with deployment requirements:<br/>Warrior &gt; No special requirements<br/>Elite Warrior &gt; Tribute a warrior that has 3 kill counters on it (kill counters are gained whenever a fighter destroys another fighter in battle)<br/>Warlord &gt; Tribute an Elite Warrior with 5 kill counters on it<br/>Legendary Warrior &gt; Tribute a Warlord with 7 kill counters on it, in addition to an Elite Warrior and Warrior on your side of the field.<br/><br/>Equipment cards can be played face up or set face down to be used at a later time. Some are one time use and others are continuous<br/><br/>Tactic cards are played face down on the turn you play them from your hand and may be activated by flipping face up on any turn after they were first played as long as the effect conditions are met (if any)<br/><br/>Battlefield cards are played face up and only one Battlefield card can be active on the field at any time. If a Battlefield card is in play when another is played, the previous one is destroyed.<br/><br/>FIELD LIMITATIONS:<br/>On the field, each player can have a maximum of 5 fighter cards in play 1 battlefield, and 6 total equipment or tactic cards<br/><br/>PHASES:<br/>The game phases are as follows for each turn<br/>Draw phase &gt; Player draws a card<br/>Ready phase &gt; All fighters that are currently in rest position (This is the position a fighter is changed to after a successful attack) are switched to attack position<br/>Main phase &gt; Player can deploy, special deploy, activate equipment, battlefield, or previously set tactic cards as well as utilize any effects whose condition is met.<br/>Battle phase &gt; Player sends his/her warriors to fight<br/>Main phase 2: do the same as the first main phase with the exception of deploying a fighter if the player already did so during the first main phase. Special deployments are limitless and can be done any number of times up to the max allows fighters in play.<br/>End phase: player ends their turn and discards a card from their hand if they are carrying 7 or more cards in hand.<br/><br/>"}, "221212": {"poll": [], "name": "Doodle Tanks", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android Version"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Doodle God"], "videogametheme": ["Military"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Joybits Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Android"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Joybits Ltd."], "description": "Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>From the creators of the award winning Doodle God &amp; Doodle Devil comes a new ALL ages puzzle game with a fun historical twist.<br/>Combine artillery and other elements to create dozens of World War II tanks and armored vehicles.<br/>Start with four basic elements and watch your creations come alive as you create historically accurate tanks and armored vehicles that once rolled across Europe and Africa.

However, farmers diverted river water upstream of the mill to irrigate their farms and the river water trickled down to a mere creek. This made the water wheel impossible to turn and put the miller out of business. The farmers said the angry miller died in an accident trying to remove a dam upstream to restore water to his mill. Some people think the farmers stabbed him with a pitchfork instead to prevent him from destroying their dam. The miller&rsquo;s wife and kids were unable to keep the house and were evicted following the miller&rsquo;s death and the farmers even took over his family&rsquo;s home.<br/><br/>Enraged and unable to move on to the next world, the miller&rsquo;s ghost haunts the derelict mill and the creek, able to go as far as the first dam he tried to destroy and back to the mill hovering over the creek. If he encounters anyone he pleads for them to destroy the dams and kill the farmers. If they do this task for him that will allow him to move onto the next realm, the ghost promises to tell them the location of his treasure.<br/><br/>The farmers if asked about the ghost offer a reward of gold, livestock, and food if they will banish the ghost forever.

Many adventurers are familiar with wading into combat against monsters and small groups of enemies, but this is nothing next to the glory and chaos and carnage that is true war. More than simply a change in scale, the difference between war and other combat can be profound. In a war, the characters are part of something larger than themselves, contributing to the efforts of their armies, or perhaps leading those armies themselves. The priorities of a soldier are different from those of an adventurer, and often the challenges that they face are, as well. While many characters can translate their talents as adventurers to the battlefield, one who specifically focuses on warfare and battlefield tactics will have the edge on others when it comes to true war. Each installment of Weekly Wonders: Archetypes of War provides six new war-themed archetypes for a variety of classes.<br/><br/>For this book, we focus on support, the unsung heroes of every army whose role it is to keep their allies going in the face of long marches, low morale, and, of course, overwhelming odds. Whether it&rsquo;s healing wounds, inspiring allies to perform at their best, or unlocking powers they never knew they had, the characters in this book may not hound the glory, but they are nonetheless vital to ensuring the group makes it through any trial. This book contains the following archetypes.<br/><br/>    The allycaster, an arcanist archetype that is able to cast spells far more effectively on her allies.<br/>    The occult tactician, an occultist archetype that can invest focus in allies, as well as objects.<br/>    The devious assistant, a rogue archetype that can protect nearby allies from area effects, and even allow allies to make sneak attacks.<br/>    The battle poet, a skald archetype that can inspire his allies to great heights, and even imbue them with magical power.<br/>    The new subdomains ally, care, friend, and shelter.<br/>    A bonus archetype for the mystic, from Path of War Expanded by Dreamscarred Press, the glyphwarder can heal her allies and create special glyphs to empower them.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "221475": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jacob Blackmon"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Heroic Rings", "rpgartist": ["Matt Morrow"], "rpgproducer": ["Perry Fehr", "Mark Gedak"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3432841.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Purple Duck Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Purple Duck Storeroom"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3432841_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Seven Rings of Power are coming, (don't get too excited, dwarves...)<br/><br/>Saturday morning cartoons and comic books from the drugstore contained mysterious 'rings of power' to give their heroes the might to fight for right!<br/>In the new Purple Duck Storeroom you can see seven of these mystical pieces of jewelry come to life!

If the total is high, you succeed! If it's low, you fail. If the total is an even number, you narrate your success or failure. If the total is odd, the gamemaster or your opponent gets to describe you success or failure.<br/><br/>The game also uses risk dice, polyhedrals from a d4 to d12 that allow you to influence your level of success or failure.

The bigger the risk, the greater your possible success - and the larger the consequences for failure!<br/><br/>ReadWriteRoll is divided into three sections:<br/><br/><br/>        The first helps you to determine the type of story you want to tell, and allows the gamemaster to put together a setting alone or collaboratively with the rest of the group.<br/>        The second section is character creation, so you can create the protagonists, antagonists, and supporting cast needed to populate your story!<br/>        The final section contains the rules, everything you need to play the game and tell your story!<br/><br/><br/>"}, "221002": {"rpgdesigner": ["Arthur Conan Doyle", "Berin Kinsman"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal", "ReadWriteRoll"], "poll": [], "name": "A Scandal in Bohemia", "rpgartist": ["Sidney Paget"], "rpgproducer": ["Berin Kinsman"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3424344.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Crime (Mystery / Detective / Noir)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Dancing Lights Press"], "rpgcategory": ["Non-Game Book (but RPG Related)"], "rpgseries": ["A Study in Storytelling"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3424344_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>A Scandal in Bohemia (A Study in Storytelling #1) helps you to deconstruct the original story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

Two to six people can play, either individually or as teams of two.<br/><br/>The 48 cards are divided into twelve 'hiki' or suits, each corresponding to a specific month. The four cards in each hiki have 20, 10, 5, and zero points. The objective of the game is to accumulate the most points by matching cards. The highest possible score is 240 points.<br/><br/>After shuffling and cutting the deck, the 'oya' (dealer) deals cards counter-clockwise to the players; the number of cards dealt differs depending on the number of players. The oya then plays a number of cards in the center of the table, known as the &quot;field&quot;. The remainder of the deck is set nearby as a draw stack.<br/><br/>Play begins with the oya and moves counter-clockwise. The player draws a card from her hand and places it in the field. If the played card matches the hiki (suit) of a card in the field, the player places her card on top of the matching card to show everyone the match. She then picks up both cards and places them face-up in a &quot;points section&quot; in front of her. She discards any cards with no value in the 'kasu' (rubbish) pile behind the draw stack.<br/><br/>Next, the player draws one card from the draw stack. If it matches a card in the field, she must take the pair of cards. Otherwise, the card is left in the field. This ends that player's turn. It is possible that a player may capture as many as four cards per turn.<br/><br/>The player to the right takes the next turn. Play continues in this fashion until all the cards have been used in each player's hand. Points are then totaled.<br/><br/>Advanced play adds a wild card and also 'yaku' (bonus combinations) in special three-card combinations that are scored at the end of the game. Holding one or more yaku causes the other players to deduct points from their score, rather than adding points to the yaku-player's score.<br/><br/>"}, "221054": {"rpgdesigner": ["Zach Best"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "TOSS: Tales of Significant Situations", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["Zach Best"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3426150.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgpublisher": ["Conjecture Games"], "rpg": ["TOSS: Tales of Significant Situations"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3426150_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>TOSS is a miniature framework for quick stories based on momentary events for a character in a roleplaying game.

Some Anthro bloodlines are products of science: genetic uplifts from animal stock, while others are creatures of parallel evolution on distant worlds, or mystical hybrids created by sorcery or divine intervention.<br/><br/>Regardless of their origins, Anthros marry the natural instincts and survival adaptations of the animal kingdom with the cunning and intellect of humanity.<br/><br/>Fursona Unleashed is a complete and comprehensive revamp of the most popular, D20-based furry character creation system ever written! Building furry heroes with Fursona Unleashed is quicker, easier and more flexible than ever before. A new character creation system reduces book-keeping, pares down a lot of unneeded rules text, and allows for deeper, multi-faceted anthropomorphic characters. Hybrid creatures, blending the traits of multiple animal species, are easier than ever to imagine.<br/><br/>Where the first edition of Fursona defined anthropomorphic characters by their Order (the species type they belonged to), Fursona Unleashed allows for a more modular character creation. Players choose a unique ability score package for their furry hero or heroine, based on its animal nature. Size is chosen similarly, allowing for everything from Tiny rodent rogues to Huge elephant clerics or blue whale astronauts perfectly adapted for the depths of space. Finally, the player chooses several Gifts of Nature for their anthro, the amount of which is determined by the anthro&rsquo;s size. Disadvantages allow the acquisition of additional Gifts of Nature, while optional templates offer further opportunities for customization.<br/><br/>"}, "221090": {"rpgdesigner": ["J.

It develops the idea of the traditional trump-card game by incorporating two main decks (Animals and Weapons), along with a 'sub-deck' of Terrain cards, which are combined to make animal/weapon combos. This eliminates much of the repetition of traditional trump-card games and allows strong weapons to compensate for weak animals. A 'capture or loot' mechanic also removes the stalemate which so often develops in trump-card games.<br/><br/>132 cards, with 60 animals in each of the main decks, makes for 3600 combinations in the base game, with multiple game modes to broaden gameplay.<br/><br/>Designed to be played in under half an hour, AWW is quick, brutal and very silly.<br/><br/>"}, "221103": {"poll": [], "name": "Churchill Checkers", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Point to Point Movement"], "yearpublished": "1943", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3479903_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["London Novelty and Display Products"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3479903.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "World War II"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This all-wood game was published in Canada in 1943, clearly cashing in on the popularity of the British wartime Prime Minister.

A great war rages across the world. &ldquo;The war to end all wars&rdquo; some call it and it seems to be living up to its name, for a more terrible yet strange war the mankind had not seen before.<br/><br/>It is definitely nothing like those that came before it, for here the men lie, waiting, almost peacefully, in the lines they have drawn. For months together, nothing has stirred over the now, black land. No bird flies over, nor any beast roams here. The silence is almost unbearable, as the men eat, sleep and go about their business in absolute monotony.<br/><br/>Suddenly, the frail sense of security is shattered by a deafening noise, as a bombshell explodes nearby, causing the men to drop their jobs and scuttle for cover. One explosion is followed by another and another and another&hellip; and so the pounding goes on and on&hellip; for days and days&hellip; till all nerves are frayed and every muscle is jittery. Just when they were beginning to think that it would never stop, it ends, as abruptly, as it had started.<br/><br/>Deafened by the onslaught on their ears, the soldiers strain to hear, fearful of that which is to follow. Soon enough, they hear a distant pattering of feet, getting closer and closer or are they? Surely, it is the sound of gunfire that they hear now or are their ears still playing tricks on them? The men arise as if from a great slumber and peer over the parapet. What they see is incredulous, for what was earlier a barren wasteland is now a rising sea before them. Their knuckles whiten as they tighten their grips over their weapons and wait for the incoming tide to draw closer, nay, wash over them.<br/><br/>It is clear, that thousands will die this day and whether or not they themselves would survive, will ultimately depend on your wisdom, as their commander and the support of the brothers, by their sides. So take charge and stand fast. For the empire!<br/><br/>Somme: The game<br/><br/>Setup: To play, each player chooses and commandeers a faction, the British or the German, consisting of a squad of 8 soldiers that are laid out in a row on the table. Rest of the cards are shuffled and 15 each, are distributed to the players, of which 8, are assigned to the soldiers already on the table while the rest of the 7 are held in the player&rsquo;s hand as reserve.<br/><br/>Strategy: Each of the fighting units under the player&rsquo;s command is unique, with different loadouts and a susceptibility to specific hardships that may be exploited by the other player by playing the hardship cards. Additionally, the players&rsquo; squad as a whole, might also be affected by certain events that may be triggered by playing the event cards.<br/><br/>Objective: The object of the game is simple, eliminate the rival faction before they eliminate you.<br/><br/>Turn Mechanics: The players alternate between attacking, with a combination of Personnel Cards and assigned Attack-Defence Cards from the table and defending, with a combination of Personnel Cards and assigned Attack-Defence Cards from the table or the reserve Attack-Defence Cards from the player&rsquo;s hand. According to the unique player interaction that ensues, the soldiers may either loose morale, possibly even leading to elimination or on a few rarer occasions, gain morale, coming out stronger to face another sapping day in the trenches.

Yoku the dung beetle sets foot on the beach of Mokumana Island, ready to take on the duties as the new postman. But the ancient island God is trapped in a restless sleep and the islanders are plagued by quakes and storms brought forth by its nightmares. Yoku's Island Express is a unique and quirky adventure with handcrafted visuals, where you&rsquo;ll soar through the air, vacuum explosive snails, fight a Screetch, feed starving lemurs, discover the mystery of the Fruit Altar, wake an old god, and hopefully help tiny Yoku rebuild the island post-office.History<br/><br/>Yoku's Island Express is inspired by the joy of exploration of a young child, having just found the entrance to a secret garden, or unlocked the door to an attic full of wonderful and interesting things to discover. It takes some of its direction from Studio Ghibli films, where nature is infused with spirit and life, but combined with a strong focus on painterly, hand-made visuals where all the locations are unique and hand-made. It's a world of bold, organic shapes with strong colors basking in bright sunlight - but where there is light there is shadow, and the journey takes us deep into the hidden mysteries of Mokumana Island.
