But clever combinations of the dice and a bit of luck, you just might be able to hole-out on this turn, or if you are really lucky, a hole-in-one!<br/><br/>"}, "11568": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic174002.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Francis Tresham"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1982", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgamepublisher": ["Avalon Hill"], "maxplaytime": "360", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic174002_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "360", "boardgamecategory": ["Ancient", "Civilization", "Economic", "Expansion for Base-game", "Negotiation"], "description": "This Civilization expansion was offered by mail order directly from Avalon Hill to General subscribers (volume 19 #4) and in the company games/parts catalog.

To play, a player rolls four dice to create a 4-digit number and then moves his or her prehistoric posse to the appropriate 1s, 10s, 100s, and 1000s places.

At the simplest level (perfect for a first-grader who knows Arabic numerals and one-to-one correspondence), kids use only the place track for the 1s. Later, cards with simple problems are introduced (&quot;Stuck in a tar pit! Move your 10s dino back two spaces!&quot;). At the most advanced level, players might encounter a question like this: &quot;Your 10s dinosaur forgot its pants, so it went back 15 to get them. Then it hurried forward 25. How far did it get?

Despite the simularity of names it is not idenical with the Hungarian game of kalabrias, which is a game for three or four players. There may have been a common ancestor, or possibly the game was taken to the New World by Central European immigrants and there bowdlerized version of kalabrias. (Exeter Books, 1984)<br/><br/>Klabberjass is played in the North American and Great Britain with the 32 card deck. (6s, 5s,4s,3s, and 2s removed from the standard 52 card deck.) The trump suit enjoys the strange ranking of the Jass genre: J 9 A 10 K Q 8 7. Non trump suit rank A 10 K Q J 9 8 7 as in the Skat-Pinochle family. Six cards are dealt to each player and a card is turned up. Non-dealer then begins a bidding round to first to accept the turn-up as trump. Or pass. If both pass on the turn-up card a second round is held. Here the non-dealer may take the bid by naming one of the other three suits or pass, dealer than may take the bid by naming the suit of throw in the hand. (Some allow for a bid of &quot;Schmeiss&quot; which means to the bidder will take the hand with the turn-up or the hand can be thrown in at the non-bidders discretion)<br/><br/>After bidding, the dealer deals three more cards to the hand. Then sequences are scored. For this purpose the cards revert back to their numeral rank. A sequence of three scores 20 and a sequence of 4 or more scores 50. tiebreakers are decided by rank. As I will describe later, it may make sense not to score in this round and you are not obligated to do so.<br/><br/>Non-dealer leads to first trick. A player must follow suit. If he cannot he must trump if able. If trump is lead he must play a higher trump if able. If he holds the King and Queen of trump he may announce &quot;Bella&quot; on play of the second card and score 50 points. Once again he may choose not to score for this.<br/><br/>After the cards are played, both score for the following cards won:<br/><br/>Jass (Jack of Trumps) 20 points<br/>Menel (9 of Trumps) 14 points.<br/>Any Ace 11 points<br/>Any 10 10 points.<br/>Any King 4 points.<br/>Any Queen 3 points.<br/>Any Jack 2 points.<br/>Last Trick 10 points.<br/><br/>If the the high bidder (The one who established trump) scores the highest, both sides score what they made. If if opponent scores higher he scores for both totals. This is why the high bidder who realizes he is not going to beat his opponent in this hand may decide not to score or &quot;Sink&quot; points during the hand. 500 points wins the round.<br/><br/>Prior to the onset of Gin Rummy, this was the most popular two handed game in the United States. It still holds a loyal following.<br/><br/>Klabberjass remains a popular two handed game in the United States. There are several variations in play and several house rules. It is very popular in New England and especially Hartford, Connecticut.<br/><br/>"}, "11641": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Brian Yu"], "poll": [], "name": "Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events: The Catastrophic Card Game", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "28", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic195768_t.jpg", "average": "4.81786", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Mattel"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic195768.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "The second game based on the popular children's books by Lemony Snicket.

The name of the work has been Due Secoli di Guerre: &ldquo;Two Centuries of Wars&rdquo;<br/><br/>Emilio Ceretti, chief of the Editrice Giochi, asked to Alex Randolph to invent a boardgame inspired to the encyclopedia.<br/><br/>Being impossible to simulate battles in a period of time from gunpowder to jet fighters, the result is a sort of an abstract wargame which tries to contain some fixed elements of war: strength vs. mobility, random factor, and bluff.<br/><br/>The game components are:<br/>-a board with an irregular tessellation<br/>-60 grey pieces with 3 holes each<br/>-120 flags, 30 for every color (red, green, yellow, blue)<br/>-the &ldquo;bluffing bell&rdquo;<br/><br/>Every player gets 30 flags of his color, and places them on 15 grey pieces. A piece with 3 flags has strength 3 and can move one space. A piece with 2 flags has strength 2 and can move up to two spaces&hellip; and I think the readers can guess the features of a piece with one flag on it&hellip;<br/><br/>Every player enters his units in the map from one side, and tries to win being the first to reach the opposite side with one of his units.<br/><br/>The combat system is quite original, and uses the &ldquo;bluffing bell&rdquo;. This is a little device similar to an hand-bell, containing two little 6-sided dices. Shaking the device makes the dices roll, and pressing the device on the table causes the dices to be blocked on their result. After the pressing of the &ldquo;bell&rdquo;, the player who is using it can pull it up and see the result, without showing it to other players. The player can repeat the shaking a number of times equal to the number of his flags involved in the combat, until he is satisfied (or wants to feign to be satisfied) by the result: at this point he can declare a result (obviously he can declare a number different from the real one!)<br/>The opponent can now accept the declared result, and then try to get and declare an higher number; elsewhere he can try to see the bluff&hellip;<br/><br/>Entering the central red square allows the player to aim an &ldquo;artillery shot&rdquo; to an enemy unit.<br/><br/>According to Alex Randolph&rsquo;s ludography compiled by Philippe Evrard, &ldquo;Due Secoli di Guerre&rdquo; has been published only in Italy by Editrice Giochi, and there is no report about editions in other countries.<br/><br/>"}, "11646": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Piquet", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Set Collection", "Trick-taking"], "yearpublished": "1534", "usersrated": "54", "boardgamefamily": ["Card Games: Outplay Games", "Traditional Card Games"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic210647_t.jpg", "average": "6.50278", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Public Domain)", "AG M\u00fcller (AGM\u00fcller)", "Dal Negro", "De La Rue", "Dondorf", "Piatnik"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic210647.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Dal Negro Italian Edition", "De La Rue Black Box Edition", "De La Rue Edition", "Dondorf Edition 1900", "M\u00fcller Edition", "M\u00fcller First Edition", "Piatnik yellow edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Piquet is a very old trick-taking card game for 2 players, reportedly invented by a M. Piquet during the Court of Charles II. It was well established in a form very similar to that used today in 1650 and remained the most popular game in France for many centuries, similar to Cribbage in the UK.<br/><br/>A 32-card deck ranking from ace to seven in the four suits is used (known universally as a &quot;Piquet Deck&quot;). A game consists either of 6 deals called a partie (in the Rubicon version) or to 100 points in the &quot;Cents&quot; version. Each player is dealt 12 cards, with 8 left as a talon.<br/><br/>Play consists of three distinct stages: (1) the exchange, (2) the declarations, and (3) trick play.  Winning requires skill at all three.<br/><br/>In the exchange phase, players may exchange one to five cards with the talon to improve their hand. Each player's discards are visible to them for the remainder of the game.  The declaration phase involves revealing melds for points (done in a formalized manner so as to reveal some but not all of one's cards). Declarable combinations include: the most cards of one suit; the longest run in a suit; and sets of the same rank, e.g. 3 kings, 4 aces.  The trick phase involves playing out the hand, with no trump.  Bonuses include taking most tricks, taking all the tricks, and scoring 30 points before the opponent declares.<br/><br/>The small deck combined with the large hands combined with the revealing of each other's cards gives Piquet play a different feel than many card games, somewhat more akin to a board game.  Part of the strategy of piquet is about controlling information: skillful players carefully determine what they will exchange and declare in order to keep secrets for another phase of the game, at the cost of points in another phase.<br/><br/>"}, "11647": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "The Big Book of Board Games", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Point to Point Movement", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1979", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic276210_t.jpg", "average": "4.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Troubador Press"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic276210.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Troubador Press First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The Big Book of Board Games is a 9&frac34;&quot;&times;12&frac12;&quot; softcover coloring book with fourteen classic games to color and play, including: The Royal Game of Ur, Nine Men's Morris, The Game of Goose, Snakes & Ladders, Chinese Checkers, Shove Ha'penny, Awithlaknannai, Backgammon, Gl\u00fcckshaus, Alquerque, Pachisi, Go-Bang, Asalto, and Senet.<br/><br/>ISBN: 0-89844-002-5<br/><br/>"}, "11648": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic542276.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jervis Johnson"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1993", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "10", "boardgamepublisher": ["Games Workshop Ltd.", "Wydawnictwo MAG"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic542276_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Fighting", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "description": "Originally published by Games Workshop in White Dwarf 161 and now available to download on GW's Spanish site, Warmaster (no relation to the 2000 miniatures game) is a two-player board game that recreates the Emperor's attack on Horus's battle barge at the end of the Battle for Earth.<br/><br/>At the start of the game the Imperial player has no idea where Warmaster Horus is located and must search the ship to find him as quickly as possible.

As in Go Fish, you must have a card of the rank you asked for. Books of 4 cards are discarded.

(For a non-trivial game, we should start with at least three heaps.) In &quot;standard play&quot;, the player who cannot make a move on his turn (because no objects remain) is the loser. A very general and far-reaching theory of such games is developed in Berlekamp, Conway, and Guy's Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays.<br/><br/>In the commercial version pictured, the players take turns removing 1, 2, 3, or 4 pegs together in a row. It would appear from the picture that &quot;rows&quot; can run in any direction, which means that the &quot;heaps&quot; intersect. This is not what most people know as Nim. Also, according to the original description, in this version the loser is the player who has to remove the last peg. This is so-called &quot;misere play&quot;, rather than the standard winning condition. Many combinatorial games allow mis&egrave;re play as a variation.<br/><br/>Nim is solved, which means that from any initial configuration, one can readily determine whether the next player or the previous player has a winning strategy, and identify a good next move in the former case. For Nim, this can be determined surprisingly readily no matter the size of the heaps, but you're not going to get the secret from me.<br/><br/>As most who would be interested in Nim know the solution, there isn't much of a game here. But Nim plays a central role in the theory of combinatorial games, as any two-player finite impartial game is in some sense Nim in disguise: any position in such a game corresponds to a unique Nim-heap, and one can play the disguised game perfectly by making the moves that correspond to winning moves in Nim. Sprouts is one example. This however does not mean that Sprouts itself is solved, as the &quot;disguise&quot; is only partially revealed.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "name": "Nim", "videogamebg": ["Android Nim"], "playingtime": "0", "average": "4.04255", "usersrated": "47", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Combinatorial"]}, "11754": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Ex", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic47615_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Bartl"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic47615.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "At the beginning the game board is filled with all 9 pegs.

Much of the game's artwork seems to have been done by &ndash; or at least, influenced by &ndash; the artists who worked on the Gold Key Star Trek comic. Players play crewmembers of the Enterprise assigned to obtain alien crystals from two planets that can be used to destroy a nearby Klingon warship, while avoiding capture by either the Klingons or the indigenous creatures on either planet.<br/><br/>Gameplay: The object of the game is to land on two planets &ndash; the &quot;Planet of Fire&quot; and the &quot;Ice Planet&quot; &ndash; to retrieve a sample of &quot;Zithium&quot; and &quot;Beton&quot; (respectively) to use against the Klingons and destroy their ship.<br/>As crewmembers of the Enterprise, you have been assigned to obtain a crystal of each substance from their respective plantes, while avoiding a giant alien spider (which protects the crystals on the Planet of Fire) and an amorphous blob called a Blurg (who protects the crystals on the Ice Planet).<br/><br/>Each player starts in the Enterprise transporter room and tries to roll the number of the transporter pad to which they are assigned to &quot;beam down&quot; to one of the planets. (If they cannot do this within three rolls, they &quot;beam down&quot; automatically.) The player then traverses the game path on the planet to try and reach the cavern containing the crystals at the path's end. Players can obtain help from Kirk or Spock by landing on the space with their picture. They can also be captured if landed on by either creature or a Klingon (spaces on the path allow either the creatures to move or the Klingons to beam down to the planets), but by the player having Kirk and/or Spock with them, the player can have their &quot;senior officer&quot; &quot;stun&quot; their attacker and continue play.<br/><br/>Once a player obtains the crystal from one planet, they return to the Enterprise and go through &quot;decontamination&quot; (moving along the red and white path near the transporter room). They then return to the transporter (via the yellow and green path) and attempt to &quot;beam down&quot; to the other planet and get the second crystal. They then return to the Enterprise and undergo &quot;decontamination&quot; again before proceeding to the Enterprise's &quot;airlock&quot; and attempting to board the Klingon ship.

The aim is for each player or soul to gather sufficient Heavenly Credits to be assured of Salvation and to avoid Damnation.<br/><br/>One difference from Monopoly is that a player can win immediately by landing on the Eternal Salvation space with adequate credit or be eliminated by landing on the Eternal Damnation space without enough.<br/><br/>Rather than building houses and hotels on the green properties, one can employ priests, canons, bishops, archbishops and saints on a mission to the satanic intelligentsia.

The game's distinctivie design feature is that batter-pitcher encounters are resolved by rolling the dice and consulting the pitcher's card. In some cases the outcome of the play is determined directly from the pitcher's card. In other cases the pitcher's card may direct you to a specific column (one of six) on the batter's card for the play result. The columns on the batter's card are organized to reflect the batter's normal, above-normal, and below normal batting average and slugging percentage.  Advocates of the game argue that dominant pitchers are more realistically simulated by this play design in that they exert more control over the outcome of each at bat than is the case for better-known baseball boardgames such as APBA and Strat-O-Matic.<br/><br/>ASG also includes clutch hitting, errors, fielders' range, fielders' arm strength, infielders' double play ability, catchers' pitch calling, balks, wild pitches, stolen bases, stamina and unusual plays.<br/><br/>The game was introduced in 1973 with player cards based upon the 1972 major league season.  The following year the company issued player cards based upon the 1973 season.  Afterward, faced with demands from the Major League Players Association for royalty payments for the use of player and team names, the game creator ceased production until the game was resurrected by 3W Games in the late 1980's.  Later, the board game was adapted to the personal computer and the software was sold under the name Diamond Dreams.

Dunnigan Award Nominee", "2005 Walter Luc Haas Best Simulation Winner"], "description": "(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>Empire of the Sun (EotS) is Mark Herman's third card driven design since he introduced the system to the hobby in We The People. EotS is a strategic level look at the entire War in the Pacific from the attack on Pearl Harbor until the surrender of Japan. EotS is the first card driven game (CDG) to move the system closer to a classic hexagon wargame, while retaining all of the tension and uncertainty people have come to expect from a CDG. Players are cast in the role of MacArthur, Yamamoto, Nimitz, and Mountbatten as you direct your forces across the breadth of the globe from India to Hawaii and from Alaska to Australia. This is represented on a single map based on a 1942 equal area projection of the entire theater of conflict.<br/><br/>As in other games using the CDG system, players try to maximize the impact of their cards even as they hide their intentions and traps from their opponent. The player is faced with a wide set of clear strategic choices. The focus of EotS is on directing major offensive axes of advance. The Japanese early in the game are challenged to achieve their historical expansion as Allied forces battle the clock to react with their in-place forces trying to achieve maximum damage to the hard-to-replace Japanese veteran units.<br/><br/>Combat in EotS is based on successfully bringing superior combined land, air, and sea forces to bear in a two-tiered combat system. The first tier is the resolution of air-naval combat, the second tier covers ground combat. The culmination of both tiers results in one side prevailing in battle.<br/><br/>The key variable in determining strategic victory is the level of U.S. political will. The Japanese win the game by forcing the U.S. into a negotiated peace, which was not achieved historically. The Japanese achieve this by knocking countries like India, China, and Australia out of the war, while inflicting massive casualties on the United States. The delivery of the A-bomb on its historical schedule is not a guarantee, often necessitating Operation Olympic and the invasion of Japan. It is often in its darkest hour that the Japanese find victory in EotS.<br/>EotS scenarios were designed with the busy enthusiast, grognard, and competitive tournament player in mind. EotS was designed to be played n yearly scenarios (1942, 1943, and 1944) of three turns each that play in under two hours. If you are a fan of CDG's, EotS takes the genre into a familiar, but new direction. If you are a fan of classic hexagon wargames, this game has all of the features that brought you to this hobby in the first place, but with a new level of excitement and replayability. The game is comprehensive, but easy to learn.<br/><br/>TIME SCALE: 4 months per turn<br/>MAP SCALE: 150 miles per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE: Brigade, Division, Corps, and Army<br/><br/>DESIGNER: Mark Herman<br/>DEVELOPER: Stephen Newberg<br/>MAP &amp; CARD ART: Mark Simonitch<br/>COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch, Dave Lawrence, &amp; Rodger B. MacGowan<br/><br/><br/>(from the designer:)<br/><br/>Empire of the Sun (EOTS), uses a variant of my card driven system. The game has one map that covers the Pacific Theater of operations from India to Hawaii, and from the Aleutians to Australia. EOTS is the first card driven game to use hexes, which facilitates calculating movement and aircraft ranges. Each game turn covers 4 months (three turns per year) with a special December 41 (special two card) game turn, for a total of 12 game turns for the campaign.<br/><br/>The game is at the strategic level using naval units built around a capital ship class (e.g., CV Wasp, BB Washington, etc.), air units at the Air Force/ Air Flotilla/ Air Division level, and most ground units are Corps/ Armies although there are a host of specialized units at the division and below level. The game has 165 cards divided into an Allied and a Japanese deck.<br/><br/>The game uses a two tiered combat system with air-naval combat preceding ground combat. The system has players roll for combat efficiency, which is a strength multiplier from .5 to 2. This value multiplied by the unit strengths is the number of hits the enemy takes in combat, with some special conditions based on number of CVs present and the like.<br/><br/>As far as game play is concerned, China is abstracted using a track whereby the play of certain events and Chinese offensives puts pressure on the Allies to support this theater with resources or see it fall and hurt Allied morale. This is balanced against the fact that Japanese land replacements come from this theater, so the more they draw it down for conflict in other locations, the more likely China will survive.<br/><br/>Northern India and Burma are active theaters of operation where the majority of the continuous ground warfare in the game occurs. If the Japanese can successfully occupy Northern India, they can drive this nation and its Commonwealth units out of the war.<br/><br/>Australia can also be knocked out of the war, although it is hard to keep it out permanently.<br/><br/>Then of course there is the famous island campaigns with the US driving across the Pacific to knock Japan out of the war.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "Second edition"], "average": "7.93487", "name": "Empire of the Sun", "playingtime": "360", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "902", "boardgameaccessory": ["Empire of the Sun Deluxe Map", "Empire of the Sun: Mounted Mapboard"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Asian Theme", "Empire of the Sun"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["GrogCast Season 3, Episode Two-o!", "I've Been Diced! episode 67: Mark Herman"]}, "11826": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Peter Wacks"], "average": "5.2269", "poll": [], "name": "Cyberpunk: The Collectible Card Game", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2003", "usersrated": "58", "boardgamefamily": ["CCGs (Collectible Card Games)", "Cyberpunk"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic464256_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Santiago Iborra"], "statistics": [], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Customizable Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic464256.jpg", "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamepublisher": ["Social Games"], "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Collectible Components"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "From the Website<br/><br/>Cyberpunk: The Collectible Card Game is a game based in the near dark future of the Cyberpunk world.

The cards are shuffled again and handed out, two by two, to both players, as for the face-up talon in the middle of the table.<br/><br/>Turn: Then each player proceeds as so: firstly, he discards a card face up on the table from his hand. If that card matches another card on the table (matching months), the player then wins both cards which he puts in his face-up collection, in front of him. The collection is always displayed in 4 columns, as so: Flowers, Ribbons, Animals and Specials. If it doesn't match anything, the discarded card stays on the table. Secondly, whether it matched or not, the player then draws the first card from the face down deck, and proceeds the same way: if it doesn't match any card, the drawn card stays on the table, but if it does match a card, the player wins both cards which he adds to his collection. Then the other player takes his turn.<br/><br/>Turn's End: At the end of a player's turn, if he has any Yaku, he can stop the current month (inning) by stating his Yakus, then the points are scored and the next month begins. However, if he wishes to continue in order to increase his score for this month, he says &quot;Koi-Koi&quot; and the other player takes his turn. If later on during the game, the player who said Koi-Koi wins another Yaku OR increases his previous Yakus, he can then again stop the game or say Koi-Koi, as many times as he wants. But if a player gets a Yaku in a game where his opponent already said Koi-Koi, then he gets the right either to say Koi-Koi too, or to stop the game and receive his points, thus leading his opponent to get no points at all this month.<br/><br/>End: Since each player has 8 cards in his hand, a month (inning) can at worse last 16 turns. In case of a game where one (or both) player(s) said Koi-Koi and no more Yakus have been added or increased before the month ends, then only the last player who said Koi-Koi scores his points as usual. The winner of a month becomes the dealer for the next month, or stays the same if there was not any winner.<br/><br/>Each Yaku can add itself to the others. Here are the Yakus:<br/><br/>Basic Yakus<br/><br/>10 Flowers / Kasu : 1 point (Each additional Flower adds 1 point)<br/>5 Ribbons / Tanzaku : 1 point (Each additional Ribbon adds 1 point)<br/>3 Purple Ribbons (blue) / Aotan : 5 points<br/>3 Ribbons with Poems (red) / Akatan : 5 points<br/>5 Animals / Tane : 1 Point (Each additional Animal adds 1 point)<br/>Doe + Boar + Butterflies / Ino Shika Ch&ocirc; : 5 Points<br/>3 Specials without the Rain Man / Sank&ocirc; : 5 Points<br/>4 Specials with the Rain Man / Ameshik&ocirc; : 6 points<br/>4 Special without the Rain Man / Shik&ocirc; : 8 Points<br/>5 Specials : Gok&ocirc; : 10 points<br/><br/>Special Yakus<br/><br/>The Moon + The Sake Cup / Tsukizake : 5 points (Bonus Yaku, only in addition to at least another normal Yaku)<br/>The Cherry Curtain + The Sake Cup / Hanamizake : 5 points (Bonus Yaku, only in addition to at least another normal Yaku)<br/>The Iris Flower is a &quot;Joker&quot; card: it can either be counted as an Animal, or as Flower to form a Kasu (but not both).<br/>The 4 Cards of the current Month / TsukiFuda : 5 points<br/>No Yakus / OyaKen : 1 point<br/><br/>The game ends when one player reaches 50 points.

The name means &quot;five points.&quot;<br/><br/>It is debated whether this game originated in China or Japan, but evidence seems to lean to the former.<br/><br/>The object is to get five stones in a row.  A Go board is 19x19, so there is a lot of room to try to get this.  (Some people play on a smaller 15x15 board.)  The winning move is to get four in a row open at both ends: your opponent can only block one end on his turn, and you claim the other making five in a row.  Therefore, a row of three stones open at both ends needs to be blocked so it won't turn into a double-open-ended four.<br/><br/>So a winning move is to create a three-three or four-three or four-four: placing one stone so that it creates two winning moves at once; only one can be blocked.<br/><br/>This is actually the children's version of the game as played in Asia.  It's been proven that Black (who goes first) can always win if played &quot;perfectly.&quot;  Long before this proof, it was realized the game was heavily weighted towards Black.

If you have too many of a specific animal, you may attempt to trade by spinning.  If the spinner lands on a trade space, you may attempt to negotiate a single trade with any of your opponents.  Otherwise, your turn ends.  Once you have all of your needed animals, you get rid of your excess at the county fair.  Again, you spin and if you land on a county fair space, you may return one group listed there to the stock.  Otherwise your turn ends.  However, if you forget to declare that you are going to the fair, you must draw animals as though it were a normal turn.<br/><br/>"}, "11945": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1043551.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Andrea Meyer", "Erik Nielsen"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2004", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": ["Design Edge", "Jean Laurent", "Pier\u00f4", "David Raphet", "Sensit Communication GmbH", "Sebastian Wagner"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Arclight", "BeWitched Spiele", "Endless Games (I)", "In ludo veritas", "KOSMOS", "Magellan"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1043551_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Party Game", "Spies/Secret Agents", "Word Game"], "boardgamehonor": ["2008 Spiel des Jahres Recommended", "2010 As d'Or - Jeu de l'Ann\u00e9e Nominee", "2010 Lys Grand Public Finalist"], "description": "US-edition<br/><br/>Creator (original version):  Erik Nielsen<br/>Publisher: Endless Games<br/><br/>From Publisher Website:  4 Cards... 1 Pair... 100 reasons why you SHOULD be right.

If there are four players, each may command a separate squadron and there will be two players per side operating together as a team. BATTLESHIPS IN ACTION is played in Game Turns. Each side moves their ships and conducts all firing and torpedo attacks during an appropriate phase of a Game Turn.<br/><br/>"}, "11982": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Getting To Know You...

Each player privately selects an activity from a List of Prizes.  As the players move around the board, they answer questions about their life experiences, preferences, wishes and attitudes.  Some cards offer the players an opportunity to guess what their partner would select as his/her choice.<br/><br/>The questions are often humorous, always entertaining and are carefully written so that embarrassing or uncomfortable subjects are avoided.<br/><br/>At a future date, the person who loses the Game arranges for the activity that the winner has chosen.
