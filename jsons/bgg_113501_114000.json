German forces pushed out of the Low Vosges forests to capture Wingen-sur-Moder, situated along the road net needed for Operation Nordwind. The attacking enemy forces struck Wingen at the first light of day and rapidly moved through the village. In the confusion that followed, Company A lost communications with Companies B and C, and for a time the Company was without radio contact with the Battalion CP in the Kirchberg. Within the company perimeter confusion made it difficult for the platoon leaders and platoon sergeants to get their men organized. Nearly every squad was on its own. Their reaction to the sudden attack was left to the judgment of the individual squad leaders. By 0900 hours the Germans had captured and occupied the town, the high ground to the northeast of town, and established a bridgehead on the south bank of the Moder River. They immediately went about establishing a perimeter defense around the village then prepared to continue their attack southward toward Saverne.<br/><br/>During the first days of January 1945 German forces pushed out of the Low Vosges forests to capture the towns that lay along the snow-covered route of attack. One of these towns was Wingen, along the Moder River. American units there were initially caught by surprise as battle-hardened troopers from the 6th SS Mountain Division stormed in and captured the town. American reinforcements were soon pouring in from the west and the south and despite bitter fighting, by January 5th the German offensive had been brought to a standstill. Lacking exits from the Vosges, planned armored reserves stood idle and Operation Nordwind ended in failure. Wingen sits in a small valley along the Moder River between Bitche to the north and Saverne to the south. Described in the following bucolic terms, &ldquo;...the village and the surrounding area looked very much like a winter scene one might expect to find on a Christmas card back home. Smoke rising from a few chimneys made the houses appear warm and inviting...&rdquo; Wingen would erupt on 3 January 1945 and become the focal-point of Operation Nordwind.<br/><br/>This module consists of eight scenarios, all playable on the Wingen-sur-Moder historical map. The map seeks to recreate this wooded region, and specifically allow for the investigation of combat problems inherent to a built-up area with river, bridges, and buildings laid out realistically in a manner unlike that which can be depicted on geomorphic boards.

During the evening, the infantry pushed west to free the main road and north to join with the Velwezelt bridgehead. Two platoons of the 2nd Company were all that remained of the Belgian troops near the Vroenhoven Bridge. On the morning of the 11th, the Germans started to attack towards the south to completely secure the bridge area. As the lead panzer elements were crossing the bridge, three Fairey Battle aircraft of the Belgian 5&Euml;me Escadrille appeared over the Albert Canal and began a bombing run against the bridge. Because their initial mission was to bomb wooden footbridges, the planes were loaded with puny 50kg bombs instead of the more potent 250kg bombs normally available. Lead by Captain Glorie, the three Battles made a first bombing run though withering anti-aircraft fire. Due to either the wounding of the observer or a malfunction of the bomb release system, Battle number T-70 of Captain Glorie, followed by the T-63 of Adjudant Delvigne, turned about and made a second run. Both were shot down after hitting the bridge.

There is a &quot;Go&quot; square in one corner, and players roll dice to travel around the squares lining the edge of the board in circles trying to acquire properties.<br/><br/>What seems like the biggest difference between the editions (i.e. the fact that you are trying to take over the galaxy) actually involves no changes from the original edition other than name changes.  &quot;Properties&quot; are &quot;galaxy systems&quot; such as Qo'noS, Romulus or Earth (home base of the enemy Federation), and they are &quot;conquered&quot; instead of &quot;owned&quot;.  The most ultimately valuable &quot;property&quot; (equivalent to Boardwalk in the original game), is now called Kronos, and the equivalent of Park Place is Khitomer.  The equivalents of the valuable green properties in the original are Boreth, Ty&rsquo;Gokor and Krios Prime, and so on. The standard money is replaced by &quot;Klingon Force&quot; scrip. &quot;Houses&quot; are renamed &quot;Outposts&quot; (and redone as small yellow dome-shaped constructs) and &quot;Hotels&quot; are renamed &quot;Capitals&quot; (miniature red versions of the Klingon High Council Building). &quot;Railroads&quot; are &quot;Starships&quot;: the Raptor, the Negh'Var, the Vor'Cha and the K'T'inga; and the &quot;Utilities&quot; are now the Rura Penthe Mines and the Praxis Energy Facility.<br/><br/>The REAL differences lie in the facts that, for one, &quot;Combat&quot; cards replace &quot;Chance&quot; cards.  Furthermore, the element of &quot;Honor&quot; replaces the &quot;Community Chest&quot;.  The penalty of the &quot;Luxury Tax&quot; is replaced by a penalty of losing a battle against Starfleet.<br/><br/>Another difference which does not affect gameplay, but which does add a lot to the feel of the game is that the board, cards, and rules are all bi-lingual: written in both Klingon and English.<br/><br/>In order to attain victory and &quot;preserve the glory of the Klingon Empire&quot;, players must conquer all of the systems in the galaxy.<br/><br/>Two editions were released, a standard &quot;Collector's Edition&quot; and a 1701-unit-released &quot;Limited Edition&quot; that includes a miniature replica of Chancellor Gorkon's bone cane from STAR TREK VI: THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY.<br/><br/>Both versions include as standard equipment: the gameboard, 6 Collectible tokens, 28 Title Deed Cards, 16 COMBAT cards, 16 HONOR cards, 2 Dice, 32 Outposts, 12 Capitals, 1 Pack of Klingon Forces, and Rules.<br/><br/>Like most of their MONOPOLY releases, this does not include the &quot;Speed Die&quot;, although the rules mention both classic &quot;speed-up game&quot; options.<br/><br/>"}, "113545": {"rpgdesigner": ["Arthur Baker", "Jeff Craigmile", "Timothy Crumrine", "Morgan Grover", "Louis Molnar", "Rob Wojczyk"], "statistics": [], "name": "TempesT's Lore (Vol. 1, Issue 1 - Jun 2002)", "rpgartist": ["Linus Persson"], "rpgproducer": ["Morgan Grover", "Glenn Kurkosky"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1165733.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["TempesT's Lore"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Coloring the Background", "Fires of Acheron", "Future Careers", "Grimoire Arcana", "Natures Own", "New Spells", "Next Month", "Prestige Class - Midnight Gypsy", "Prestige Class - Psi Spider", "Solid Foundations", "Survivors of the Storm", "TempesT's Guide to the Underdark", "The Howling Winds", "The Long Hard Trail", "The Witches Brew", "Variant Class - The Pretender"], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (3rd Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1165733_t.jpg", "description": "Premier issue<br/><br/>Cover art uncredited<br/><br/>The table of contents is detailed in the Article list below.<br/><br/>"}, "113546": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Pirrone"], "poll": [], "name": "Kemozako", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Betting/Wagering", "Paper-and-Pencil"], "yearpublished": "1998", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: France"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1294022_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Clever Games SA", "Kemozako", "Lansay"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1294022.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Kemozako Edition 2002"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Party Game", "Trivia"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Party word game with old words from history of the French language.  <br/>Object of the game is both to invent the definition of a word in order to bluff the other players, and also to find the true<br/>definition.<br/><br/>Players place their tokens to the &quot;Start&quot;-space.<br/>In his turn player draws one &quot;Kamizako&quot; card and sets out to define the word (be careful not to specify its spelling).

To the inhabitants on Earth it seems like the only chance for a decent life is to fight, in a &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; scenario. A man named Jado finds a powerful blue fighting armor and calls himself &quot;The Fighting King&quot;. With it, he quickly gains control of the world. Using his newfound power, he erects a tower with six guards. Many try to take Jado's power away, but unfortunately, they die in their attempt. Some weeks after the building of the tower, a tournament is held all over the world to see who is the strongest. Of the many fighters, only four people are chosen. Now they need to fight each other to see who is going in the tower.<br/><br/>The game can be played with one to two real players. The game starts off with only four characters, but a Boss Code can unlock the other seven characters. The game has three modes: Story Mode, 1-Player to CPU Mode, and Multiplayer Mode. The fighting engine is a traditional style, 4-button engine. The B and A buttons are the kicks, being light and fierce respectively, and the Y and X buttons are the punches, light and fierce respectively. All characters have at least two special attacks. In all modes, the more life anyone loses, the more bloody the characters' faces become, much like in SNK's Art of Fighting series; however, like the final epilogues of the main characters, were removed from the North American and European versions.<br/><br/>There are ten stages in story mode, where either Syoh, Zazi, Kotono and Vortz fight. After picking a character, the player must fight the other three in a tournament-style fashion. After fighting the other heroes, the player must fight the six guards leading to Jado. After fighting Jado, there is an ending sequence (only in the Japanese version) followed by a screen saying to go to hard mode, or a congratulations for the completion of beating hard mode. After beating hard mode, the closing credits show a clip of the players' battles with the enemies faced. The four main characters' skills evolve over story mode, featuring a RPG-like element, meaning their special moves become slightly larger and more powerful after each group of opponents are defeated.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Tuff E Nuff&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "113626": {"poll": [], "name": "Turbo Toons", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European SNES edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Empire Interactive"], "videogamegenre": ["Racing"], "videogameplatform": ["SNES"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Empire Interactive"], "description": "Hanna Barbera's Turbo Toons is a Europe-exclusive video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System that was released in 1994.

An enhanced port of this game is named &quot;F-14 Tomcat&quot; on Game Boy Advance.<br/><br/>This game is entirely played in first-person perspective, inside the cockpit.  The player has on the beginning of every mission to launch from an aircraft carrier and has to land on it on the end of every mission as well. Although launching is easy, landing requires some skill, and the player may get frustrated if he crashes when landing, as he has to do the whole mission again.<br/><br/>While on air, the player will receive his objective, which consists of taking down enemy jets and/or enemy bases on small islands. The player has three types of missiles and the machine gun to destroy the enemy jets. Each missile differs on range, accuracy and speed. To destroy the enemy bases, the player can only use the machine gun.<br/><br/>The game has a certain amount of strategy, as on late missions, the fuel becomes a problem, as does the ammunition (except for the machine gun, which is limited, but to a very high amount, making it almost impossible to end it). It is possible to refuel the jet while on air, attaching to a bigger aircraft sent by the aircraft carrier, but to reload the missiles he has to land on the aircraft carrier, which is a risky task, so the player has to consider which enemies he is going to spend his missiles, as he receives an absolute maximum of six missiles per time, and in some missions, up to 17 enemy jets.  By pressing and hold &quot;Y&quot; button before the player takes off, he can access a fully configured Tomcat system menu.

The game comes with 10 fictional teams, each consisting of 20 fictional players (13 position players and 7 pitchers). Each position player is rated for batting average and power versus both left-handed and right-handed pitchers, plus speed, arm strength, and fielding ability. Each pitcher is rated for opponents' batting average, along with strikeouts and walks against both left-handed and right-handed batters.<br/><br/>The outcome of an at bat is determined by rolling dice and consulting the pitching card. If the pitching card indicates that the batter made contact (fly ball, line drive, or ground ball), the batting card is then checked against the result of another dice roll to determine where and how far the ball is hit.<br/><br/>The batted ball is plotted on the gameboard with the built-in batting stick. Defensive players, who were positioned on the playing field grid, attempt to make a play on the batted ball. Depending upon their initial positioning, their speed, their fielding ability, and in some cases their arm strength, the result may be a base hit, an out, or an error.<br/><br/>The appeal of 851 Baseball is that it depicts the movement of the ball, defensive players, and baserunners as each play unfolds. For example, a line drive might be caught by an outfielder or it might find the gap and roll to the wall. Baserunners advance according to their speed and can be instructed to try to take an extra base.<br/><br/>Multiple dice rolls can be required to fully resolve the outcome of an at bat, but play moves relatively quickly and the visual element sets this game apart from most other baseball boardgames.<br/><br/>The game comes with gameboard and batting stick, 5 dice (4 six-sided and 1 twenty-sided), color-coded playing pieces, rule book, 10 batting cards, 10 pitching cards, a pad of scoresheets, all attractively packaged in a game box.<br/><br/>"}, "113641": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1164006.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Dieter Stein"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "8", "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)", "nestorgames"], "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1164006_t.png", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "description": "Spire is a game that can be played with the Shibumi game system.

These battles are often characterized as the modern system of skirmishers and columns against outdated linear tactics. However recent research has challenged this simplistic view in that Prussia had begun to modernize their infantry tactics and used skirmishers following their conflict with the Revolutionary French Armies.<br/><br/>La Bataille d&rsquo; Halle is such a battle. The French Corps of Bernadotte attacks the Reserve Corps of the Duke of Wurttemberg. The Prussians are defending the Army&rsquo;s line of communication which runs through an important crossing of the River Saale. The roads to both Leipzig and Magdeburg exit from this city and the main Prussian Army is retreating along one of them.  Marshal Bernadotte moves onto the map and attempts to break through in pursuit of that main army. Victory levels are determined based on your ability to better the historical result.<br/><br/>Each 20 minute turn starts with a Command Phase for both sides followed by the French Player sequence and then by the Prussian Player sequence. The sequence includes movement, cavalry charges, fire and melee. During each, morale plays a decisive role. This is a great one player on one player game that can be completed in an afternoon. In addition to the historical game there are two scenarios that vary the orders of battle and appearance times.<br/><br/>The original rules have been updated but not expanded to any extent.

Passing a set of virtual worlds grants an ending sequence, and completing all the levels without losing all lives remaining wins the game. The format is similar to the previously released Bart's Nightmare, save for the lack of a hub world from which the levels were accessed. Gameplay for most of the levels consisted of standard platforming elements; others took advantage of the SNES' Mode 7 abilities. The levels were as follows:<br/><br/>Dinosaur: Bart is a dinosaur that somewhat resembles a coelophysis, on top of Mt. Springfield in the primeval era. The player must survive the various platforming hazards while fighting off other dinosaurs and neanderthalic versions of various Simpsons characters. Homer, as a caveman, is particularly persistent, and appears as a boss along with Moe, attempting to knock Bart into a freezing lake. Sending the two into the lake ends the stage; an ending is played of a frozen Homer on display at the Springfield Museum of Natural History, sighing &quot;D'oh&quot; as Dr. J. Loren Pryor passes by with a plateful of donuts.<br/>Baby: Bart &quot;relives&quot; his infancy, escaping from his bedroom at the Simpsons' residence to explore. The player must guide Baby Bart through complex platforming sequences while avoiding hazards and animals. Bart eventually ends up in a live circus act, and is safely launched back home via cannon without his parents realizing his absence (at least Marge).<br/>Pig: Bart is an escaped pig at Krusty the Klown's pork factory. The player must rescue Bart's swine brethren while again surviving platforming hazards and fending off clowns and corporate thugs. After defeating the owners of the factory, an ending sequence plays of Pig-Bart freeing all the captive pigs.<br/>Water Slide: Bart slides down a massive, surreal waterslide tube at a waterpark, dodging hazards and other waterpark patrons. The slide sometimes forks, with only one path the correct one. Taking the wrong fork will either force the player back (courtesy of a pudgy Homer blocking the way), or ejected from the slide into a bizarre death such as falling off a cliff or being eaten by a lion. Reaching the end of the level grants an ending sequence of a triumphant Bart soaking the twins Sherri and Terri. Blinky the Three-Eyed Fish makes a cameo as both a hazard and a marker for the level's progression meter.<br/>Vandal: Bart, from his hiding spot, must hurl tomatoes and eggs at his Springfield Elementary classmates, striking each one. Running out of time and/or throwing objects with classmates remaining results in failure, as does hitting any passing adult (the exception is Principal Skinner, who can be hit in the posterior when he is bent over).<br/>Post-Apocalypse: A spoof of the Mad Max films, Bart is a road warrior attempting to survive a post-nuclear holocaust Springfield. The level plays similarly to such game classics as Road Rash and Mach Rider. The player bikes through a highway while fighting off persistent attacks from Jimbo Jones, who throws bombs at Bart from his ATV, and the more troublesome Kearney, who attempts to beat Bart with a chain when he pulls alongside him, as well as ramming Bart's motorcycle with a chariot-like vehicle. Bart may defend himself by kicking the bullies when along side their vehicles, or by shotting water balloons when behind them. Otto and his bus also act as an obstacle, driving the opposite way of Bart in an attempt to hit the player, which causes tremendous damage. Completing the level sees Bart return to his home on Evergreen Terrance. Bart's family is revealed to have been long dead, reduced to a group of skeletons on the living room couch. An uncaring Bart shoves their bones out of the way as Krusty's post-apocalyptic TV show is about to air (&quot;Hey, surviving kids!&quot;).<br/><br/>If the player runs out of lives, game over occurs (with Bart getting embarrassing nausea from the virtual-reality machine). If the player successfully passes all of the levels, a final ending sequence shows Bart safely escaping the machine, while a gullible Homer tries the machine himself to immediate disaster<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Virtual Bart&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "113666": {"poll": [], "name": "War 2410", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American SNES edition"], "average": "4", "videogameseries": ["War"], "videogametheme": ["Military", "Science Fiction", "War - Future"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Advanced Productions"], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["SNES"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Advanced Productions"], "description": "War 2410 is a war-related video game that takes place in the year 2003, when scientists have developed the perfect soldier through genetic engineering. Three groups of soldiers that were enginereed to protect humanity have revolted against their masters. As a result, four factions are fighting it out for control of the Earth. The player is in command of the GDA (Global Defense Alliance) and the primary objective for the game's twenty missions is the total annihilation of M.A.R.S. (a group of unsavory superhumans who have turned against their masters), the Orcs, and the Cromes (which can be summarized as a group of self-sentient, self-aware combat robots). Capturing a lab results in the ability to build a superweapon to destroy the other factions; some missions require players to capture enemy bases for the war effort.<br/><br/>Each side has infantry, tanks, and the air force needed to get the job done. Units differ in movement and attacking range. Some ground units cannot attack air units and vice versa. Terrain also affects combat as some types of terrain, like trees or buildings improve a unit's defense.

In the first one &quot;Henry II&quot; - Silesian and German forces  face the Mongol army alone. In the second and third scenarios - the succor of Czech forces in included, therefore they may be more difficult for the Mongol side.<br/><br/>The goal of each side is to eliminate all leaders of the opponent - or to score more points if this can't be done (points are scored for each leader, destroyed unit or captured standard).<br/><br/>This is a typical hex and counter game. Initiative is determined in each scenario and kept for the entire game. Players perform their actions in order, with possible reactions (when enemy units enter missle range). Example:<br/><br/>1. Player A moves cavalry (reaction fire possible)<br/>2. Cavalry of player A attacks<br/>3. Player A moves infantry (reaction fire possible)<br/>4. Infantry of player A attacks<br/>5.

During the inception of the title, the development team also began work on a Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version and both were released in October 1995. WeaponLord introduced many groundbreaking gameplay aspects that appear regularly today. Also unlike other titles, WeaponLord was not intended to replicate an arcade fighter, but built from the ground up on home consoles. This was a reverse of the normal trend, which had arcade versions being developed first, then getting ported in home consoles.<br/><br/>On a battlefield a demon spirit enters the body of a dying mercenary. He is reborn and defeats the reigning war king in a duel. He goes on to found the reign of the DemonLord Zarak. At the height of his power, his doom is foretold by a shaman<br/><br/>&quot;When the night turns violent and the moon bleeds, gripped by the skeletal fingers of death...a child will rise to face the demon in combat...and the lord of demons will fall by the hand of...the WeaponLord.&quot;<br/><br/>Against the advice of his lieutenants to kill the children born that night, the DemonLord waits to face his foretold killer in fair, one on one combat. 25 years later, sensing the prophecy is at hand, the DemonLord holds a great tournament of champion warriors. The winner will face the demon in a final battle. The Demonlord prepares to meet his destiny head on and to destroy the WeaponLord.<br/><br/>At its core, WeaponLord is a standard 2D fighting game experience. Where it differs is in its gameplay mechanics, and in some of its aesthetic choices and presentation. Some of WeaponLord's more original features were:<br/><br/>Thrust-Blocking - An aggressive blocking system two years ahead of Street Fighter III's similar Parry System.<br/>    Multiple Endings - Characters would have completely different ending sequences depending on which opponents were spared or killed with a Death Combo during the Story Mode.<br/>    Deflect - Each character has one special move that acts as a Deflect. This is similar to a thrust block, as it collides with an enemy's strike, knocks it backward...but it then automatically hits the character while they're off-guard.<br/>    Take Downs - Certain special moves that also knock an opponent onto their back. A player can then follow up with additional attacks while their foe is still on the floor.<br/>    Hair/Clothing Trim - When certain attacks are performed on an opponent in mid-swing, the player can cut off a piece of their clothing or their hair. An added humiliation.<br/>    Password System - A password is given at the end of a match, so the player can always return to the middle of a game, if need be. A secret password is also given so the DemonLord Zarak is playable in Story Mode.<br/>    Death Combos - Unlike Mortal Kombat or Primal Rage, Death Combos are a certain string of regular and special moves that each have a gory effect on their opponents. These combos take skill and timing to master, and can also be done in a few different sequences. Some effects include disembowellings, decapitations, head splittings which expose the brain, and body pulp; which tears away most of the flesh from the torso.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Weaponlord&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "113694": {"poll": [], "name": "Wheel of Fortune Deluxe!", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American SNES edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Words"], "videogamefranchise": ["Wheel of Fortune"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Imagitec Design Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["SNES"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["GameTek"], "description": "Follows the 1989 rules, but uses the 1992 set and has detailed graphics, somewhat-simplified controls, and the Speed-Up Round (which was previously only available in the first three NES editions, and only in the earlier SNES version if there was a tie).<br/>    The full spinning wheel is replaced with a much simpler animation.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Wheel of Fortune (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "113695": {"poll": [], "name": "Winter Gold", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European SNES edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Sports - Skiing", "Sports - Snowboarding"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Funcom"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["SNES"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Nintendo Co., Ltd."], "description": "Winter Gold is a winter sports video game with events like bobsled, ski jump or snowboarding, all in a 3D graphics environment.

The Alpha 1 Federation has gathered together the systems best defenses in an effort to repel the invasion. Three pilots and their machines are dispatched to NGC-1611, charged with the task of destroying the invader's power source and, if possible, locate the legendary weapon Xardion in the process.<br/><br/>Planet NGC-1611 is a typical world in all ways, omitting that it was constructed from raw materials by an unnamed scientist. His desire was to create a planet which could not die. His work was dubbed &quot;Project New Frontier.&quot; The project was a failure, and violent monsters rapidly evolved, making NGC-1611 uninhabitable by humans. The scientist's final instructions to the supercomputers that once managed the planet were: &quot;Protect my daughter! Eliminate all intruders.&quot;<br/><br/>However, the scientist's daughter passed away after these instructions were given. The supercomputers, not knowing how to proceed with their directive, eventually found a holographic image of the scientist's daughter and projected it into a protective capsule. They chose to defend that capsule in place of the actual girl. Sometime after, an undisclosed event or chain of events lead the supercomputers to send an invasion to the Alpha 1 system.<br/><br/>While possessing the typical qualities of action platformers at the time it was made (jump, duck, shoot etc.), Xardion made use of a few novel elements. Additionally, the game had a role-playing element where experience points could be accrued by defeating enemies and bosses, and each level up increased the player's maximum life and special ability points.<br/><br/>During the game, the player takes control of one of three available robot forms. Each form represents one of the three inhabited worlds in the system: Alcedes, from the Fire Planet; Triton, from the Water Planet, and Panthera, from the Desert Planet.<br/><br/>Each form has its own particular abilities and weaknesses. For example, Panthera is less than half the height of the others, and as such can enter narrow passages to collect items. Additionally, each form possesses its own health and special ability points, and must be upgraded separately from the others. This is equivalent to a 'tag team' game mechanic, where one heavily-damaged character can be swapped instantly for another.<br/><br/>Eventually, one of the robot forms is replaced by Xardion, which combines the abilities of all three previous forms and exceeds them. Xardion only becomes available near the end of the game, but joins the team at level one. An obstruction that can only be cleared by a sufficiently leveled Xardion forces the player to return to earlier levels in order to gain levels and develop special abilities.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Xardion&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "113698": {"poll": [], "name": "Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Genesis edition", "North American SNES edition"], "average": "6.375", "videogameseries": ["Aero the Acro-Bat"], "videogametheme": ["Cartoon"], "usersrated": "4", "videogamedeveloper": ["Iguana Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["SEGA Genesis", "SNES"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sunsoft"], "description": "Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel is  a spin-off of the Aero the Acro-Bat series.

Zero receives a note from his girlfriend Amy that evil lumberjack Jaques Le sheets is destroying his forest homeland in order to use the trees for printing money. Zero, despite the protests not to do it from his master Edgar Ektor (who tells him nothing is more important than his mission with him, notably referring to Ektor's plan B from Aero 2), decides to return home and stop Le Sheets (which explains why Zero is absent from Ektor's side in the Aero 2 final battle). When arriving his home island, Zero's plane is shot down and crashes on the beach, so he must make his way to the forest on his own. Zero's path takes him through caves where he faces creatures from the dark, a volcano where he defeats mining workers and guard robots, a river he must go through in his own jet ski, the forest where he defeats the metal claw-wielding guardian, a boat ride through a toxic waste sewer and finally Jaques Le Sheets money paper factory. After a confrontation where he finally defeats the evil Jaques Le Sheets Zero spots a flying ship trying to escape, which he manages to board just in time. There he finds out it was all a plan from his own master Edgar Ektor (it is left to the player to assume that this was his fool-proof back up plan referred in the ending of Aero the Acrobat 2). While holding Amy hostage, Ektor faces Zero in a final battle. In the end, with assistance from Amy, Zero is able to defeat his evil master and leaves him aboard his own flying vehicle to crash on the beach.

In particular they can expect:<br/><br/>A streamlined and revised character creation system, with greater emphasis on character background, but also significant changes that influence a character's starting skills and abilities and the speed with which adventurers develop, improve and progress. Particular attention has been paid to training and skill improvement, but you will also find that the structure and range of skills is greatly enhanced, meaning that new adventurers begin with a greater degree of competence across the board.<br/><br/>Although all the familiar concepts remain (Combat Actions, Strike Rank and so forth), the combat process is based on simple rolls, does not rely on any resolution matrix, and introduces special Combat Manoeuvres simulating the cut and thrust of real combat whilst offering a truly epic, cinematic edge. Combat is faster than before an perhaps more deadly, but every character will find a greater range of tactical options and combat effects that create a satisfying, exciting, combat flow.<br/><br/>The presentation of the game rules has been restructured to make it easier for Games Masters and players to find what they need, when they need it. The system is designed with clarity and ease of use in mind.<br/><br/>Great pains have been taken to ensure full backwards compatibility with RuneQuest II. All RuneQuest II books and expansions remain compatible with Legendand, indeed, material presented in earlier editions has become the foundation for the new game.<br/><br/>So, it is with great pride that we bring you Legend; a new take on a classic system, assembled by designers and writers who have more than 50 years of RuneQuest experience between them.<br/><br/>"}, "113711": {"rpgartist": ["Olivier Frot", "John Koelepp", "Pedro Potier", "Esther Sanz", "Angga Satriohadi", "Chad Sergesketter"], "rpgitemversion": ["Digest Softcover Version", "PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Monsters of Legend", "rpgdesigner": ["Pete Nash", "Lawrence Whitaker"], "rpgproducer": ["Richard Ford", "Jonathan Goodyer", "Gareth Hanrahan", "Nick Robinson"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1236421.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "average": "7", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Mongoose Publishing"], "rpg": ["Legend"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1236421_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>Foes, beasts and creatures from every corner of the world can be found in this tome, ready to use in your games of Legend!

They can sprout horizontally or diagonally upwards, but must not break or tangle unnaturally.<br/><br/>Aim: All players win by placing the thirtieth ball, thus completing the pyramid, without losing the game in the process.<br/><br/>Setup: Place all 48 balls (16 of each color) in the bag. Each player draws a ball at random and holds it so that everyone can see it. The player who first recites a haiku or poem about beauty plays first. Choose difficulty, Easy, Medium or Hard<br/><br/>Play: When a player's turn comes, he must place the ball he holds on any hole on the Shibumi board or on top of a 2&times;2 platform created by balls. He then draws a new random ball and play continues counter-clockwise.<br/><br/>In Sprout, unlike other Shibumi games, dropping a ball is not allowed. You never remove balls from the pyramid you build as branches of a cherry blossom tree cannot be cut by themselves.<br/><br/>Game Loss: The players lose the game in two ways<br/>1) If, at any time, two balls of the same color on the same level are diagonally next to each other (break)<br/>2) If, at any time, a ball is placed on an upper level and there are two balls of the same color adjacent to one in the lower-level platform (tangle)<br/><br/>Wish: During their turn, any player may use one of the team's wishes to put the ball he holds in the bag and draw a new one of the color of his choice. If you chose the Easy difficulty, the team has 3 wishes. If you chose Medium, the team has 2 wishes, while if you chose Hard you have only 1 wish<br/><br/>Etiquette: The players are generally not allowed to speak about the game, suggest moves and interrupt a player's thinking.<br/><br/>The exception to this are the ancestors. After a ball is placed, any player other than the player who placed it is allowed to appeal to an ancestor and explain, in a few words, why this is a bad move and suggest a better one.

Draft characters from different worlds, dimensions and even other games! To win you must take advantage of the various abilities and powers to maximize your resistances and strike at you opponents weaknesses! Tactical maneuvering is crucial as you battle for dominant positioning!<br/><br/>In Animus, the players draft characters from a pool of cards to form their own deck of combatants. They will use this deck to battle the other players and defeat all of their characters. This game doesn&rsquo;t use any resources or any other cards other than the character cards themselves.<br/><br/>Each card in the game is a unique character different from the others. They each have their own powers and a set of strengths and weaknesses. As players bring in characters into play they must choose a combat position for them such as Attack, Range or Support. During play they may shift their characters between the positions or may be forced to by their opponent. Combat is resolved with dice rolls and character stats. This game is also the debut of the E=Cube. This is a system that assigns each character an elemental type that gives them strengths and weaknesses to each other.<br/><br/>The E=Cube is a system of elements and forces similar to the basic four elements everyone is used to. This system however takes it a step further by adding in four natural forces relative to the four basic elements. These forces and elements relate to each other and have different strengths and weaknesses to each other. Furthermore, the types can be combined to create new types, each with its own set of strengths and weaknesses. For instance, Water and Fire types can be combined to create a Steam type. This system is a tool that can fit many types of games and genres. This system doesn&rsquo;t seek to supersede a games&rsquo; rules, it merely adds on to them to give another layer of strategy. This is a useful tool for designers to use as all the possible combinations of the types are already determined in the source document. The designer simply needs to plug in the system to their game in whatever fashion it fits. It can also be modified to fit the game theme. The source document will also come with a basic set of icons that may be used royalty-free.<br/><br/>Find out how you too can use the E=Cube for free!: E=Cube [nightstalkergames.com]<br/><br/>NOTE: This game features characters from the games Dragon Blast and Monster Kids as well as characters from future games!<br/><br/>"}, "113832": {"poll": [], "name": "Mad Monday", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Browser Flash edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Driving"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Mausland Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Web Browser"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Drive a vehicle on the freeway, destroy other motorists and wayward pedestrians.

In 1996, however, 1,500 copies of the game were located in a warehouse, and eventually put on sale on the secondary market. All copies of the game were reused Action 52 cartridges, some with a small gold sticker reading &quot;Cheetamen II&quot;. This cartridge is now very hard to find, though numerous ROM images exist on the Internet. Copies of the game value at almost $1,000.<br/><br/>In Cheetahmen II the player again assumes the role of one of the three Cheetahmen (Aries, Apollo and Hercules); after defeating a boss at the end of the second level, they switch to the next Cheetahman for the following two levels, as in the Action 52 version. Due to a bug, it is impossible to get to the levels in which one plays Cheetahman Aries without altering the ROM image or experiencing a glitch that very rarely starts the game on these two levels.<br/><br/>Cheetahmen II is famous for its music, and for its lack of quality in all other areas. Like Action 52, it was not licensed by Nintendo.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Cheetahmen&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "113876": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jonathan Roberts"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "poll": [], "name": "Arena of Fire", "rpgartist": ["Jonathan Roberts"], "rpgproducer": ["Steven D.

However, they lacked all of the essential elements of a great army to bring the war to a successful conclusion. This was due to the severe cavalry losses in Russia and the lack of Napoleon's subordinate commanders to successfully operate on their own. Shortly after Bautzen an armistice was agreed upon and both sides used the time to rebuild their forces. During this period Austria and Sweden joined the Sixth Coalition and the numbers tipped dramatically in the Allies' favor.<br/><br/>Now you can refight the famous battles of the Fall Campaign of 1813 such as Leipzig and Dresden. March in the steps of the young French conscripts or lead the Prussian landwehr towards the French lines with Blucher's famous cry of &quot;Vorwarts mein kinder!&quot; All of the armies of the 1813 Fall Campaign await your command.<br/><br/>Campaign Leipzig is the product of three years of research and design. The scenarios represent the titanic struggle that engulfed Germany during the Fall Campaign of 1813.

It was released in Japan on November 27, 1992, and in Europe in 1993. The game's plot centers around the bunny-like being Yacopu (\u30e4\u30b3\u30d7?) and his quest to retrieve the flower of peace so that peace will return to Yacopu's disarranged world. The protagonist's trademark ability is to shapeshift into different forms.<br/> A port for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console was created and released in Japan on November 30, 2011.<br/><br/>At first glance, Trip World is like a scaled-down, miniature version of Gimmick!, another one of Sunsoft's games. In Trip World, the player controls Yacopu through five relatively large and slightly linear stages to explore and complete. They include areas such as a mountain, a jungle, the ocean and a castle.[5] The stages also feature some secret passages and divergent paths. The objective is to find the stolen flower of peace, since the inhabitants of Trip World turned mad because of its absence, acting as the enemies in the game.[6] At the end of each world, Yacopu faces a boss, in the fifth and last world the player has to defeat multiple bosses in a row in order to complete the game. There are also a few mini-bosses in certain parts of the stages.<br/> Yacopu is able to shapeshift between three different primary forms at any time, these forms are manually activated by the player when desired.[7] In his normal form, he is able to walk and to jump and can attack enemies by kicking them. When Yacopu's ears transform into wings, he is able to fly in a limited way. This form doesn't allow to fly completely freely through a stage due to gravity, and since the player isn't able to change direction during flight, and Yacopu always falls down when he touches a wall. In the third form, Yacopu resembles a fish. While he can't move on the ground, the fish-like Yacopu is able to swim well and attack enemies with foam in water. Beneath these three forms, Yacopu also occasionally shapeshifts into other special forms which can't be manually activated or deactivated by the player. By picking up special power-ups, Yacopu turns into forms such as Flower Yacopu (stunning enemies with seeds) or Tail Yacopu (tail attack with long range) for a limited time.<br/> The player's character has four health points and loses them by touching spikes or when being hit by enemy attacks. Other than in many other platform games, most of the enemies in Trip World don't hurt the player's character on touch. Many benign enemies will become violent if attacked by Yacopu however. Most of them just push Yacopu around when not angered, while other enemies are able to attack in certain manners and do so freely. All bosses are able to hurt Yacopu. The player loses a life when all health points are gone.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Trip World&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "113923": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Elizabeth Northcutt"], "poll": [], "name": "Lunch Box", "playingtime": "40", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Food / Cooking"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Lunch Box Board Game, LLC"], "boardgameversion": ["Lunch Box Board Game First Limited  Edition"], "maxplaytime": "40", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Trivia"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "40", "description": "Lunch Box is a  patent pending, educator recommended children's health and fitness board game that has been in development since 2007!

Each player starts with 8 white, 8 black, and 8 red balls. Keep this supply of 24 balls hidden from your opponent at all times during the game. Use an opaque container (e.g. the Shibumi bag) to receive defeated balls over the course of the game. It should be able to hold 24 balls. Never look in this bag of defeat during the game.<br/>Both players simultaneously and secretly select a ball from their supplies. Simultaneously reveal them on a count of &quot;White, black, red, go!&quot; The stronger ball (White beats Black beats Red beats White) goes into play wherever the &quot;winner&quot; likes; the weaker goes into the bag of defeat.

But the place is already occupied by lost souls which have been in confrontation for ages. The Standish cannot escape from this haunted house and will be the collateral damage of the conflict.<br/><br/>In Phantom, the four areas of the house &ndash; Garden, Basement, Ground Floor and First Floor &ndash; are placed in a line, with the areas divided into two sides. Each player controls Ghosts in half of the house, and he must make Spectres, Souls and other Spirits appear in front of the different areas of the house in order to frighten the Occupants before the other player. Each turn, a player can play a card &ndash; Ghost or Place &ndash; in order to increase the Scare level of his corresponding apparition; each Place card must be played in front of its corresponding area(s); for example, the Attic must be played in the First Floor,while  the Stairs can be played either in the First Floor or in the Ground Floor. (Note: In Europe, the first floor is customarily the initial floor above ground level, while in the U.S. the floor at ground level is the first floor.)<br/><br/>The Ghost cards can be played in front of any areas. Each of them creates a special effect:<br/><br/><br/>    The Squatter takes a Place from the opponent's apparition.<br/>    The Charmer makes an Occupant come in the area.<br/>    The Howler puts Occupants off the area.<br/>    The Knocker discards a Ghost from the opponent's apparition.<br/>    The Queen takes a Ghost of his family from the opponent's apparitions.<br/>    The Invoker gets a Ghost back from the discard pile.<br/><br/><br/>Unfortunately for you, the adults of the family can kill off some vulnerable Ghosts, and a family of Ghosts is vulnerable to each of the adults. Some Places protect the Ghosts from the adults.<br/><br/>At the end of a player's turn, the Scare level of the apparitions in the different areas are compared to the Fear threshold of any Occupants located there.

On the one hand, it&rsquo;s universal: everyone has to eat. (Except undead. And constructs. And elementals. And...okay, maybe not so universal.) On the other, almost no one actually pays attention to it.<br/><br/>However. just like minuscule portions of seasonings can change the flavor of an entire dish, creatively using food in your campaign can bring a whole new feel. Food shouldn&rsquo;t be the focus any more than you should make a dish mostly out of cinnamon, but a pinch of culinary flavor here and there can make the entire world come alive.<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s what this book is for. In Cooking with Class, you&rsquo;ll find dozens of such seasonings you can throw in to your campaigns, from typical grains and vegetables to alcoholic drinks to how to eat things like purple worm and dragon (and the proper etiquette for doing so). While some could be the focus for an entire campaign&mdash;such as a magic blight destroying the kingdom&rsquo;s staple food supply&mdash;most will simply add flavor and variety to your game. So take a pinch from here and a dash from there, sprinkle liberally with adventure, and see where they take you.<br/><br/>Cooking with Class gives you loads of information about food, spices and alcohol, provides tons of food related adventure hooks, cooking methods and exotic ingredients, etiquette, new poisons, 3 prestige classes (Adamantine Chef, Synergistic Chef, and Toxicant), new feats, new magic items, magic drinks, new spells, sample menus for eating establishments, sample locations with backgrounds and npc's, and some new food themed monsters!<br/><br/>"}, "113939": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Paul Rohrbaugh"], "average": "7.71429", "poll": [], "name": "A Bold Fight: The Battle of Mobile Bay", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Hex-and-Counter"], "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "7", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1267430_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Bruce Yearian"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["High Flying Dice Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1267430.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["High Flying Dice Games first edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["American Civil War", "Nautical", "Wargame"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "One of the most violent and decisive naval battles of the American Civil War.

Alien races meet up close as they encounter each other for the first time in ship boarding engagements and planetary invasions with different types of ground troops. The strengths and weaknesses of each alien empire are brought out with roughly 20 unique racial abilities. The expansion takes advantage of the streamlined nature of the game system to add more technology and cool sci-fi things in very simple ways. While it is designed to be used as a whole, the expansion is modular and players can choose to use only the parts that they like.<br/><br/>Also included in the expansion is an experience system so that your ship groups become more proficient over time. There is a big benefit if you can keep ships alive! The game gives more counters of each ship type to accommodate groups at different experience levels. Military academies in your empire can give your new groups a head start in accumulating experience.<br/><br/>Titans, super large ships beyond dreadnaught, make their appearance and can both carry fighters and destroy planets, but have liabilities too. As requested, fleet counters and a fleet display are in the box. In addition to racial advantages, there are also unique Alien Technologies that can be gained by conquering the non-player Alien planets. There are more technologies and some more money is added into the game because of the larger tech tree.<br/><br/>New scenarios are added for both 3 and 4 players. A new alien empire solitaire scenario is included as well as another solitaire scenario where a player can attempt to fight off an invading mass of Space Amoebas.<br/><br/>Space Empires: Close Encounters includes thicker counters for itself as well as a complete set of thicker counters (4.5 counter sheets) from the base game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "8.26673", "name": "Space Empires: Close Encounters", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "336", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["4X games", "Solitaire Games", "Solitaire Wargames"]}, "113943": {"poll": [], "name": "MX vs ATV Reflex", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["MX vs ATV Reflex"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2473922.jpg", "videogameseries": ["MX vs. ATV"], "videogametheme": ["Driving"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["Rainbow Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Racing"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "6.15", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["THQ"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2473922_t.jpg", "description": "The core focus of the game allows for the player to race motocross and supercross on motocross bikes or ATVs. The game also includes events such as omnicross, free ride, champion sport track, waypoint racing, and freestyle motocross.<br/>Although the game is part of the MX vs ATV series, Reflex was built from the ground up featuring a new control scheme and physics engine. The new control scheme is labeled &quot;reflex&quot; which utilizes both analog sticks. The left analog controls the handlebars while the right analog stick controls the rider's body movement. The reflex system allows for unprecedented control and manipulation by allowing the player to 'ride' the motorcycle and other vehicle as they actually would. Tricks have been simplified from the previous games as the player only needs to hold the modifier button and use the right stick to make different combinations and flips.<br/>Also new to Reflex is real-time terrain deformation. Terrain deformation allows any of the different vehicles to literally carve into the earth creating ruts, berms, braking bumps and acceleration bumps as they actually do in real life. These ruts, berms and bumps are dynamic and constantly changing throughout the course of the race adding for an extra sense of realism.<br/>Online mode consists of public and private rooms. These rooms are dedicated to specific event types (i.e. supercross) and host up to twelve players at a single time. A player's 'motocard' keeps record of the player's progress through online events which earns them experience points that go towards the player's level. Mini games such as 'snake' and 'tag' are played online as well.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;MX vs. ATV Reflex&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "113944": {"rpgdesigner": ["Bob Alberti", "M.

The only important difference is that giant monsters, much bigger than the largest dinosaur, populate the Earth. Some of them are benevolent earth guardians, protecting the planet from mankind&rsquo;s folly and invaders from outer space, others are unstoppable forces of nature bent on global destruction.

Each volume in this line presents a small set of monsters tied to a single theme, but spread over a range of CRs. For Covens of Chaos that theme is variants of hags, the classic crone&mdash;witch of fables and ancient mythology. As an added bonus, author Sam Hing has put together an awesome set of hag-related magic items, spells, and feats to round out your wicked wise women.<br/><br/>Hags are prevalent in many old fables, and are often portrayed as hideous witches who may or may not be human. From the witch who wanted to eat Hansel and Gretel or the tales of Baba Yaga in her flying mortar to the Greek and Norse depictions of the three Moirai (or Fates or Norns), powerful, ugly women of power are common antagonists in many of the stories from which modern fantasy roleplayng games draw inspiration. The very term &quot;hag&quot; evolved from the Old English word h&aelig;gtesse, a word for &quot;witch&quot; that is also the root of the Germanic hexe, the origin of the hex powers of the witch character class. Much like witches, hags have a broad range of powers and a bad reputation, though unlike many witches, the hags' reputation is almost entirely deserved.<br/><br/>While numerous types of hags already exist in the pages of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary, this product expands their options (and CR range) to ensure there's always a hag appropriate for any adventure. Within these pages you will find everything from hags that just wish to fill their bellies to those dedicated to destroying the powerful servants of the outer plains. From the disgusting and cowardly whaitiri (CR 3) to the terrifyingly destructive kalaratri (CR 15), the Covens of Chaos are ready and able to plot against player characters of any evel.<br/><br/>So put some more wood around the cauldron, take a big bite of that shiny apple, and tell the children to be home before nightfall. The gwrachods are looking for new trophies, the night filches have their hair woven into nets, and the truies are hungry. The Covens of Chaos are plotting, and you're not going to like what they have planned!<br/><br/>"}, "113968": {"rpgartist": ["William McAusland", "David Posener", "David Sharrock", "Ryan Sumo", "Peter Szmer"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Orcs of the Eternal Zenith", "rpgdesigner": ["David Posener"], "rpgproducer": ["Creighton Broadhurst"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "rpgpublisher": ["Raging Swan Press"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Tribes"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>The golden hush of midday bakes the rocky slopes of Marred Peak, scorching the hands of the orcish penitents sweltering before their shining prophet, Granalak Searshriek.
