Which is scarier: zombies or werewolves? For generations this has puzzled commoner and philosopher alike. But now, the question will be answered. Which supernatural entity has the power to cause the most terror in the unsuspecting citizens of some nameless town? Only you can decide.<br/><br/>Zombies vs Werewolves is a fast-paced card game for 2 players that takes roughly 15 minutes (or less) to play. It&rsquo;s simple, competitive, and all about determining who can score the most Terror Points before the game ends by frightening an assortment of random Citizens.<br/><br/>Play begins by selecting 6 Citizen cards at random and laying them out on the table face up. Each person chooses one deck of cards (either Zombies or Werewolves) to play with. During each player's turn, they will be able to play a card from their hand and then draw back up to a hand limit of 5 cards. Cards played are either Terror cards (cards with a number from 2-6 and 8) or Special Event cards (unique cards with special abilities that can be used once a game each). Each side plays Terror cards on Citizens to try and meet or exceed the Citizen's Courage rating; the player that meets or exceeds the Courage rating first frightens that Citizen and prevents the other player from claiming them at the end of the game. Play continues until all Citizen cards have been frightened. Then the total Terror points played on all frightened Citizens is added up on each side.<br/><br/>The player with the most Terror Points at the end will be declared the victor, proving once and for all (or until you play again) that their side is the scarier of the two.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"118221": "First edition"}, "age": "10", "name": "Zombies vs Werewolves", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "average": "6.92857", "usersrated": "14", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "105004": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1206": {"name": "Christophe Boelinger"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Sarena", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "52", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1066834_t.jpg", "average": "6.32971", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"9413": {"name": "Ludically"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1066834.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"118227": "Multilingual first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Sarena is an abstract game involving strategy and bluffing.<br/>You find more details in german and french on the asmodee website.<br/><br/>"}, "105005": {"rpgitemversion": {"118228": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Dregoth Ascending: Part I \u2013 The Day of Light", "rpgproducer": {"25050": "Gabriel Cormier"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1103617.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"395": "Dark Sun"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"1788": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1103617_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher's web site:<br/><br/>The Dread King walks the surface world again.<br/><br/>An Army of Light decends upon one of the seven, and casts it into Darkness.<br/><br/>And the blood of thousands of unbelievers runs in rivers at the feet of he who would be a god.<br/><br/>    Part 1: The Day of Light<br/>    Part 2: The Quest<br/>    Part 3: The Ascension<br/> In order to play Dregoth Ascending, you will need The Dungeon Masters Guide, Player's Handbook, Monster Manual, and the Expanded Psionics Handbook, as well as the Dark Sun 3 Core rules and Terrors of Athas, available as free downloads from the official Dark Sun web site athas.org.

Unfortunately, the river also contributed to its troubles, because in 881, the Normans traversed its watery path, and thereby easily captured the city. That act of aggression stunted Tournay's prosperity. This game invites you to participate in the reconstruction of the city, in order to establish a glorious era that will last for more than seven centuries. Help your district flourish by cleverly coordinating the work of the city's three domains: military, religious, and civil. Certainly the prestige of your buildings will brighten the entire city!<br/><br/>Tournay is a card game from the same designing team as the 2010 release Troyes with artwork once again by Alexandre Roche. In this game, players manage a district of the city and its three classes of citizens. The cards are classified by level (I to III) and color to form nine distinct decks. Players initially have two citizens in each class that they will use each turn to carry out one of five available actions, such as drawing cards, or using the powers of their buildings.<br/><br/>In each player's district, the building cards save them money, make more efficient use of the decks of cards, or recruit new citizens. The character cards optimize the use of buildings if properly positioned. It's up to you to create the most effective card combinations. Finally, constructed prestige buildings will give you valuable prestige points, depending on how your district has developed. But beware: Your opponents will also benefit from every prestige building you build!<br/><br/>Note that an expansion is included in the base game's box, so advanced players can add still more replay value to this dynamic game!<br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>There are 3 sets of cards (yellow, red, white) in 3 groups (I, II, III); also, a set of black event cards. There are always 3 face-up event cards, most of which are bad. Players start with 2 meeples in 3 colors (yellow, red, white), placed on their Plaza card.<br/><br/>On your turn:<br/><br/>     First, you may play a card from hand to your display (3x3 grid) by paying the appropriate cost (some combination of coins, meeples, cards, etc). You may play a card on top of another of the same color; if played on top of a different color, discard the older card. <br/>     Then take one action:<br/>         Draw a card; move 1-3 meeples off the Plaza to draw a level I-III card; you may pay others 2 coins to use their worker(s). If you draw the event card of that deck, place a coin on each event card, then trigger all event cards once per coin.<br/>         Activate a building card by moving a meeple from your Plaza to the building card (max 1 Meeple/building); cards do a variety of things like give you coins, recruit an additional meeple, use someone else's card, etc.<br/>         Combat an event by paying the cost (usually 1 Meeple, 1 coin, +1/coin on the card; or, 2 meeples) shown; take the card as a reward. Later, when events trigger, you may play this from hand to prevent an event from affecting you.<br/>         Reactivate all workers: return all meeples to your Plaza, and remove all markers from building cards.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The game ends at the start of the Start Player's turn if 2+ players have all 9 cards in their display; OR if only 1 player has, but at least n-1 Town Crier cards have been revealed. Everyone then gets to play one final card (paying normal costs). Earn VPs for all cards in display, and for all Event cards you've combated.

The game's box even featured a painting of Arnold Schwarzenegger as the muscle-bound warrior with his new costume for Destroyer. Despite this attempted tie-in, the game has little to do with the movie series except for the fact that it features the Cimmerian in the title role. This is due to having originally been designed without the Conan tie-in, as a boomerang throwing game titled Visigoth.

The turret can swivel to cover a large area of the screen, but cannot move from its base. Helicopters fly across the screen at varying heights, progressively lower over time, dropping paratroopers. The gun may fire multiple shots at once, and the shots may destroy helicopters or shoot paratroopers. Optionally the gun can also control its shots after they are fired (an initial game setting).<br/><br/>Paratroopers may be disintegrated by a direct hit, or their parachutes may be shot, in which case they will plummet to earth (splattering and dying if they were sufficiently high when the shot hit, scoring on impact). If they land on a previously landed paratrooper, that paratrooper is also killed. If a falling paratrooper collides with another paratrooper in the air, the lower paratrooper loses his parachute and falls (occasionally two paratroopers from different helicopters can collide causing only the lower one to fall to his death). Furthermore, destroyed helicopters turn into shrapnel, which may destroy other helicopters, paratroopers, or parachutes. Periodically, jets may fly by and drop bombs; the jets may be shot as well, but the bombs must be shot as they unerringly home in on your turret.<br/><br/>Waves consist of helicopters coming at progressively lower altitudes, a brief rest, then a wave of jets. If the jet wave is survived, there is a short respite, then the next round of helicopters begins with an extra row of helicopters on the first run. The next jet wave also has an extra row of jets and the potential of having bombs dropping from two directions. Paratroopers will not deploy their parachutes until they drop below the last row of flying helicopters.<br/><br/>The player earns points by shooting helicopters (5 points), paratroopers (2 points), jets (5 points), and bombs (25 points). Firing a shell costs the player one point, so if one is playing for score, there is an incentive to conserve ammo. The score never drops below zero.<br/><br/>The game ends when the player's turret is hit by a bomb, when a single paratrooper lands directly on the turret base, when three paratroopers safely land atop each other immediately adjacent to the turret base (allowing the third to jump onto the base), or when four paratroopers safely land on either the left or right of the turret (that is four on one side, not four total). If four land on a side, they are able to build a human pyramid and climb up to the turret and blow it up once the sky is clear. There is a chance to kill the paratroopers before they assault the turret if you can cause still-airborne paratroopers to fall without parachutes on enough ground forces to reduce them to fewer than four on a side, fewer than three stacked by the turret base, or remove all from atop the base. They will not perform the final assault until all airborne forces are gone.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabotage_%28video_game%29,&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabotage_%28video_game%29,&quot</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "105099": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic202363.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"17934": {"name": "Ryan Dancey"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1996", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"14753": "Rob Alexander"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"396": {"name": "Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG)"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic202363_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "The Battle of Beiden Pass was the first 2-player starter set for the Legend of the Five Rings CCG.<br/><br/>The starter set allows the players to play out the Battle of Beiden Pass, in which the Crab Clan have abandoned their centuries-old post protecting the empire from the forces of the Shadowlands, creating an alliance with their enemy in an attempt to take Beiden Pass, the crossroads of the empire.

The game doesn't necessarily have a 'campaign' mode like some other city-building games, but instead has the player play through different scenarios such as life in the chaos of Pompeii under the terror of Mount Vesuvius. Along with maintaining cities, the players must also keep them very well-organized and keep money spread out among the people.

While much of the game is focused on building and maintaining cities, there are some RTS elements when opposing cities and civilization do battle with the player's.

Who loves whom? And how much?<br/><br/>During the game, each player flirts with all several other players. All the actions &ndash; such as flirting, sending text messages or giving your heart away &ndash; bring in flirting points. Who will flirt the best, gain the most flirting points and become the &quot;best&quot; couple?<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player receives a character (or two characters in a three-player game), two hearts belonging to that character and two relationship tokens, and a pawn, which is placed on the board. Then, each player thinks up a term of endearment for himself. When players address each other, they should use this term of endearment. A player who fails to do so correctly loses a relationship point.<br/><br/>The game is played in turns. On his turn, a player rolls two dice, picks one, and move his pawn as many spaces as the die shows. (In a three-player game, the player rolls one die, and selects one of his pawns to move.) After moving the pawn, the player may flirt with one character of the opposite sex whose pawn is on the same space or an adjacent space. If he does so, this strengthens the relationship between the two characters. This is measured by placing flirting points on the &quot;love barometer&quot;. If two characters have four flirting points, they fall in love. After four more points, they get engaged, and after another four points, they get married.<br/><br/>Furthermore, if the pawn has landed on a heart space, the player may either give one of his hearts to another player, or ask for a heart from another player (who then has to give one of his hearts to the asker).<br/><br/>If the pawn has landed on a text message space, the player draws one of the text message cards, reads it out loud and places it face-down in front of him. If no more cards remain in the draw pile, the player can either give one of his cards away or ask to receive a card from another player (who then has to give one of his cards to the asker).<br/><br/>The game ends when a pair of characters have married. Now, each player scores points as follows:<br/><br/>    For the highest relationship status achieved (with any one other character): 4 points for being in love, 8 points for being engaged and 12 points for having married.<br/>    -1 point for each of your own hearts, +2 points for each heart from another player.<br/>    -1 point for each negative text message, +2 points for each positive text message.<br/>    +1 point for each remaining relationship token.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The player who has scored the most points wins.<br/><br/>"}, "105129": {"poll": {}, "name": "Umbra Turris", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1068504_t.png", "average": "5.875", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"18082": {"name": "Spellcrow"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1068504.png", "boardgameversion": {"118573": "Polish edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1010": {"name": "Fantasy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Umbra Turris is new skirmish level miniatures game in which players control 6-12 heroes, trying to gain fame and wealth in ruins of old, grim city of Umbra Turris.<br/>Using high quality miniatures and free intuitive rules players can assemble and highly customize their own band of heroes and then lead them to death or glory in one of six scenarios provided with rules.

Details on why this is important in the description.<br/><br/>Risk Legacy represents what is if not a new, at least a rare concept to boardgaming: campaigning. At its core, the game, particularly at first, plays much like regular Risk with a few changes. Players control countries or regions on a map of the world, and through simple combat (with players rolling dice to determine who loses units in each battle) they try to eliminate all opponents from the game board or control a certain number of &quot;red stars&quot;, otherwise known as victory points (VPs).<br/><br/>What's different is that Risk Legacy' changes over time based on the outcome of each game and the various choices made by players. In each game, players choose one of five factions; each faction has uniquely shaped pieces, and more importantly, different rules. At the start of the first game, each of these factions gains the ability to break one minor rule, such as the ability to move troops at any time during your turn, as opposed to only at the end.<br/><br/>What makes this game unique is that when powers are chosen, players must choose one of their faction's two powers, affix that power's sticker to their faction card, then destroy the card that has the other rule on it &ndash; and by destroy, the rules mean what they say: &quot;If a card is DESTROYED, it is removed from the game permanently. Rip it up. Throw it in the trash.&quot; This key concept permeates through the game. Some things you do in a game will affect it temporarily, while others will affect it permanently. These changes may include boosting the resources of a country (for recruiting troops in lieu of the older &quot;match three symbols&quot; style of recruiting), adding bonuses or penalties to defending die rolls to countries, or adding permanent continent troop bonuses that may affect all players.<br/><br/>The rule book itself is also designed to change as the game continues, with blocks of blank space on the pages to allow for rules additions or changes. Entire sections of rules will not take effect until later in the game. The game box contains different sealed packages and compartments, each with a written condition for opening. The rule book indicates that these contain the rule additions, additional faction powers, and other things that should not be discussed here for spoiler protection.<br/><br/>The winner of each of the first 15 games receives a &quot;major bonus,&quot; such as founding a major city (which only he will be allowed to start on in future games), deleting a permanent modifier from the board, destroying a country card (preventing it from providing any resources towards purchasing troops in future games), changing a continent troop bonus, or naming a continent, which gives that player a troop bonus in future games. Players who did not win but were not eliminated are allowed to make minor changes to the world, such as founding a minor city or adding resources to a country.<br/><br/>It should be noted that although cards are ripped up over the course of the game, there are so many cards added via the sealed packages, that the game does not suffer. Nor is this a &quot;disposable&quot; game, merely a customized one. The game can continue to change beyond the 15 game campaign, and even when it finally does stop changing, you still have a copy of Risk that is completely unique, and plays better than any other version of Risk.<br/><br/>Initial games take approximately 30-90 minutes to play, which includes a brief rules explanation and setup.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"118585": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.55342", "name": "Risk Legacy", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "5686", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"24281": "Campaign Games"}}, "105135": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Gorky 17", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"330471": "French Windows Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3227960.png", "videogametheme": {"2265": "Horror"}, "usersrated": "8", "average": "6.1125", "videogamegenre": {"2414": "Tactical Role-Playing Game"}, "videogameplatform": {"5248": "Linux"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3227960_t.png", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>You control a small group of NATO soldiers, headed by Cole Sullivan, a commando with extensive scientific knowledge.

This latest offering will take the series in a completely new direction and offer a style of gameplay yet to be seen from the franchise.<br/><br/>Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City delivers a true third person team based shooter experience set within the dark and sinister Resident Evil universe and a reinterpretation of the events depicted in Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3. The setting of the Resident Evil universe not only provides a rich backdrop to the action but delivers a unique and thrilling triple threat battle. Zombies and Bio-Organic Weapons (B.O.Ws) add to the mix as players not only compete against an opposing squad but also tackle this third unpredictable element, creating a brand new style of gameplay and breaking the conventions of traditional team based shooters.<br/><br/>It is September 1998 and the action centres once more on the ill-fated Raccoon City and the horrific consequences of the deadly T-virus outbreak from the Umbrella facility. With a cover up required, Umbrella orders an elite team into Raccoon City to destroy all evidence of the outbreak and eliminate any survivors. Hearing of this plan, the US Government dispatches its own special forces to uncover any evidence that exposes the cause of the viral infection and Umbrella&rsquo;s actions. Players take on the role of an Umbrella Security Services soldier (U.S.S.), competing alone or in four player co-op in a battle against all the competing forces at play in Raccoon City.<br/><br/>Expect the return of original Resident Evil enemies, iconic landmarks such as the Raccoon City Police Department and fan favourite characters, including Leon S. Kennedy, who as a rookie police officer in Raccoon City is on your hit list to eliminate. Players will experience a retelling of classic moments from past titles Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3 and watch the events unfolding from the menacing perspective of the Umbrella Security Service, giving fans the chance to rewrite the history of the Raccoon City outbreak.<br/><br/>In addition, Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City will deliver a number of competitive online multiplayer modes. Each one of these will provide a unique gaming experience thanks to the three way combat between the Umbrella Security Service, US Special Ops and threat of zombies and B.O.Ws that could only exist in the deadly and twisted Resident Evil Universe!<br/><br/>Purchasers of Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D, scheduled for release in the coming months, will get a taste of the horror to come thanks to the addition of a playable demo of Resident Evil Revelations.

It is played on the cells of an initially empty hex hex board. The suggested size is between 6 and 10 cells per side. Both players must have access to a sufficient number of black and white stones.<br/><br/><br/>Definitions<br/><br/>A group is a set of connected, like-colored stones. A single stone is also a group.<br/><br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>Starting with Black, players take turns placing one or two stones of any color on empty cells. On their first turn, Black can only place one stone.<br/><br/>At the end of each turn, there must be an odd number of groups on the board (i.e. the sum of the number of Black and White groups must be an odd number).<br/><br/>Players can pass their turn at any moment, unless it violates the previous rule (this means Black can't pass on their first turn).<br/><br/>When both players pass in succession, the game ends. The player with the fewest groups on the board wins. Draws are not possible.<br/><br/><br/>Notes<br/><br/>Double placement serves both as a first move equalizer and a way to make the game playable under the group restriction rule.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, apart from the intended goal of eliminating draws (they would be common otherwise), forcing an odd number of groups at the end of a turn has some interesting tactical implications which make the game feel similar to a single placement game. For example, groups separated by two empty cells can't be joined on a single turn, since the player runs out of stones to restore the groups count to an odd number. Also, the diamond connection (two stones at each end of a four-cell rhombus) is safe if the opponent has exactly zero or two groups adjacent to the intermediate cells, and unsafe otherwise.<br/><br/>Endgames are also quite tricky under this rule: you'll often want to join two of your own groups or create another opponent group, but you'll be unable to do it because you can't restore the groups count anymore!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"118754": "First edition"}, "name": "Yodd", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2055": "Paper-and-Pencil"}, "average": "7.375", "usersrated": "12", "boardgamefamily": {"26432": "Combinatorial"}}, "105174": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"223749": "English/European PlayStation 3 edition"}, "average": "6.42857", "videogameseries": {"5580": "Sly Cooper"}, "videogametheme": {"2336": "Furries / Talking Animals"}, "usersrated": "7", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4435": "PlayStation 3"}, "videogamehonor": {"35540": "2013 Global Game Awards Best Platformer Game of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Sly Cooper&reg; and the whole gang return with an epic brand new adventure for the PlayStation&reg;3 system.

Should a Runner choose to surrender before time is up, they can use a pay phone to exit the game and they will receive money equal to the time until they quit.  However, if a Runner is tagged by a Hunter not only are they eliminated from the competition but they also receive ZERO cash.

As Missions come up, the Runners have to decide whether or not they will risk participation or if they'd rather hide to avoid being discovered and eliminated.  But unlike the TV show, Missions have an added bonus: Runners who successfully complete a Mission earn powerful Items that will help them avoid capture by the Hunters.<br/><br/>As the time ticks away and the money adds up, the Hunters continue their patrol.

Each planet has a different combination of values for jumping to it, scanning it and landing on it.<br/><br/>Each player has a hand of five cards, with each card having three color-coded values on it: blue for jumping, green for scanning, and orange for landing. On a turn, you take two actions from six possibilities, with the same action being possible:<br/><br/>&mdash;Top up: Discard any number of cards (including zero), then refill your hand to five cards.<br/><br/>&mdash;Jump: Move your spaceship from the jump gate (where players start the game) or a planet to any other planet by discarding a card that shows the landing value of the target planet. Place one of your tokens on the jump gate.<br/><br/>&mdash;Fly: Move your spaceship to either neighboring planet; this move is free.<br/><br/>&mdash;Scan: Discard a card with the scanning value of the planet where your spaceship is currently located; look through the face-down planet tiles, place one aside face-down with your marker on it, then return the tiles to that planet. This action is possible only on undeveloped planets.<br/><br/>&mdash;Develop: Develop the planet where your spaceship is located by discarding two cards that match the two landing values shown on that planet. Mark this planet with your space station token, hand out all scanned and claimed planet tiles to the appropriate players, claim one remaining planet tile for yourself, then place the remaining tiles face-down again. A planet can be developed only once.<br/><br/>&mdash;Discover: Take a planet tile of your choice from the developed planet where your spaceship is currently located.<br/><br/>If at any point, all of the planet tiles on a planet show only empty space, the player holding the tiles lays them face-up next to that planet. When 6-12 space tiles have been revealed, an amount based on the number of players, the game ends and players tally their points.<br/><br/>Each type of planet tile scores in a different way. With Minerals, for example, you multiply the number of mineral tiles you hold with the largest number of mineral tiles in a single color. Medals are worth three points each. A green-blue pair of Matter tiles is worth seven points, while a single Matter tile is worth only two.

Planets that you conquer along the way can be used to build up your reserves for reinforcements.<br/><br/>Finally, S.E.U.I.S.* is a game within a game.  There is the grand strategic game of fleet against fleet, with all its challenges of planning and deployment.  But when actual ship-to-ship combat occurs, we give you true arcade action that demands quick reflexes and a sharp eye to really - you guessed it - shoot'em up in space!<br/><br/>By John Lyon<br/><br/>"}, "105252": {"statistics": {}, "name": "BioDefense: Zombie Outbreak", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"119059": "iPad edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1075461.png", "videogametheme": {"2265": "Horror"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2474": "Tower Defense"}, "videogameplatform": {"6826": "iPad"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1075461_t.png", "description": "Explore the wastelands of BioDefense in this unique release from Resolution Interactive that will revolutionize strategy games on the iPhone/iPod Touch platform.

The player takes the role of Wally, who has gone to bed for the night and has to wake up early in the morning for work. Unfortunately, his alarm clock has not been wound, and thus he will sleep late in the morning, and his boss will fire him. However, in his sleep, Wally's consciousness travels around his home, and other places, wearing his pyjamas, in search for the key to rewind the alarm clock and wake himself up.<br/><br/>The game is made up of static single-screen rooms, each of which can include platforms in various arrangements, objects to pick up, and enemies to avoid. Wally can walk through the screens to progress through the game's map and to pick up objects. Wally can only carry two items at a time, so each time he picks up an item, he drops an old item in its place. Contact with an enemy drains Wally's &quot;snooze energy&quot;, and if it runs out, Wally loses one of his &quot;lives&quot;. When all three &quot;lives&quot; are lost, Wally returns to sleep and doesn't wake up until late in the morning, losing the game.<br/><br/>Pyjamarama can be played either with a joystick or with the keyboard.

Es un juego de rol de fantas&iacute;a donde t&uacute;, el jugador, interpretas a un personaje ficticio en un mundo fant&aacute;stico (y si eres el director de juego, normalmente<br/>abreviado como DJ, puedes interpretar a montones de personajes diferentes).<br/>La mejor analog&iacute;a la brinda Ron Edwards, un dise&ntilde;ador de juegos que sabe lo que hace. Edwards compara un juego de rol con tocar en una banda: los miembros se juntan y deciden qu&eacute; tipo de m&uacute;sica quieren interpretar.<br/>Una persona (el DJ) gu&iacute;a, y el resto de los miembros aportan lo que pueden para crear algo que es, idealmente, lo que desean. Es como tocar m&uacute;sica en una banda: un miembro puede encontrar un riff excelente<br/>que nadie esperaba pero al que todos se acoplar&aacute;n.<br/>Donjon es como una sesi&oacute;n de acid jazz. Est&aacute; hecho para darle control a los jugadores: pueden iniciar un solo de guitarra o bater&iacute;a cuando lo deseen. Si algo suena bien, entonces pueden continuar.

Anyway, read on.<br/>Donjon is an exciting do-it-yourself type game in which you kick doors, explore dark dungeons (or as we like to call: donjons), kill monsters, find treasure and save all. It is a fantasy role-playing game where you, the player, play a fictional character in a fantasy world (and if you are the director of game, usually<br/>abbreviated as DJ, you can play lots of different characters).<br/>The best analogy is provided by Ron Edwards, a game designer who knows what he does. Edwards compares a role playing game with playing in a band: the members get together and decide what kind of music they want to interpret.<br/>A person (the DJ) guide, and other members contribute what they can to create something that is ideally what you want. It's like playing music in a band: a member can find a great riff<br/>than anyone expected but we all engage.<br/>Donjon is like an acid jazz session. It is meant to give players control: they can start a single guitar or drums any time. If something sounds good, then you can continue.

Under most circumstances, the rules in the book are more than sufficient at covering a broad range of common items that can be found in the garage, storeroom, behind counters, etc. But this may not be enough for the GM who knows a location well enough to know precisely what is available and in roughly what quantity. Also, a GM who desires to inspire a higher degree of fear in their players by making certain resources extremely finite (even those that are otherwise common) would benefit from adapting the rules in the Outbreak: Undead core rulebook to incorporate such a frightening reality. An entirely optional, but efficient, way to accomplish this is by using a &quot;Resource Catalog&quot;.<br/><br/>A &quot;Resource Catalog&quot; is a list of what a character is able to purchase with their available Resource. What is on this list is based on the locations that the characters loot during missions or what kind of location they are in when the game starts. For most scenarios, the items are automatically added to the catalog once the location is successfully searched. The master list that a can be purchased from when characters are in their Stronghold is the &quot;Strongohld Resource Catalog&quot;. Otherwise, purchases can only be made in the location they are found in.<br/><br/>"}, "105371": {"rpg": {"6175": "Outbreak: Undead"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Things That Go \"Crash\" In The Night...", "rpgproducer": {"50805": "Christopher De La Rosa"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1071519.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"119543": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"28957": "Horror (Zombies)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"11727": "Free Content Friday"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1071519_t.png", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>As terrifying as waves of zombies can be, the thought of one monster being a continual threat in addition to the many horrors of the zombie apocalypse is especially frightening.

The game had an overhead map of various locations in the city that the player can travel to, with animated scenes, but then the gameplay would switch to a more traditional side-scrolling adventure game.<br/><br/>Superman has an energy (Super Power) bar and he can collect various icons in the game to use a limited supply of one of his item powers: x-ray vision (make certain enemies visible), superflight, super spin, heat vision (laser attack), and ice breath 1 and ice breath 2 (freeze enemies). One of the main difference from the comics was that Superman's x-ray vision was used to make invisible enemies visible. The instruction booklet explained that glitch by claiming that &quot;Superman is now unable to see inside buildings, as Lex has lined all the buildings in Metropolis with lead!&quot; Aside from the item powers, Superman can also jump and punch. Players start out the game as Clark Kent but can change into Superman (provided that they have enough Super Power) by entering into one of the phone booths that are scattered throughout the city. However, taking sufficient damage from enemies would cause Superman to become Clark Kent. Whenever Superman entered the Daily Planet building he would always revert to Clark Kent, no matter what his power level was. The game also came with an area map that split up the districts of Metropolis and allowed Superman to use his superflight power to quickly change areas. Occasionally a &quot;Help!&quot; signal would appear on the map, such as a person being mugged, to which Superman could fly to that area immediately and aid the person in need.<br/><br/>At the end of each city level, or &quot;chapter&quot;, the player battles a different boss and, upon defeating the boss, is given an animated front page of a Daily Planet newspaper praising their success. The second to the last chapter boss in the game is Lex Luthor. This is followed by three fights in a row against the exiled criminals from Krypton; Ursa, Non and General Zod at the &quot;Statue of Freedom&quot;, which looks like the Statue of Liberty.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Superman (Kemco game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "105390": {"videogame": {"105854": "Aeria Games Power Collection"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Shaiya", "videogamemode": {"2327": "Massively Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"119602": "Windows downloadable edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1091289.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2162": "MMO"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"105854": "Aeria Games Power Collection"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1091289_t.jpg", "description": "Shaiya is a stunning free-to-play fantasy MMORPG that immerses players in a massive war between the forces of Light and Darkness.

As a result, Stadium Events was renamed and repackaged under the title World Class Track Meet, and all Family Fun Fitness mats and copies of Stadium Events were pulled from store shelves. Stadium Events has become the hardest to find licensed game available on the Nintendo Entertainment System; there exist fewer than 10 known complete (cartridge, manual, and box) copies of Stadium Events. The game is so rare that a boxed copy sold with a NES system for over $13,000 on eBay in February 2010.

Cohort Studios developed a PlayStation 3 version of the game that was released on the PlayStation Store on May 14, 2009 which included trophy support and, for the first time, players could use a DualShock controller as well as the Buzz!

It's primarily aimed at the family market but offers appealing entertainment to almost anyone of any age. Simple game play allows young children to participate while still being entertaining enough for older children and adults. The game is similar in concept to Jungle Party, with robot based mini-games in a space-themed environment. One of the main differences between Jungle Party and Robo Jam is the introduction of AI, allowing players to play against the computer. Unlike Jungle Party there is no solo game mode.

In this 2D fantasy you take on the role as the base commander of a space colony far, far away, and must use five building types in a creative way to efficiently expand and defend it. Build power plants, mineral harvesters and defense towers and make sure they have sufficient energy to fend off endless hordes of evil aliens. The game offers a vast array of possible strategies with these simple rules, and will compel you to try new and better base designs every time.<br/><br/>The fundamental gameplay action of Harvest: Massive Encounter is to place buildings that cost credits and energy. Credits are gained by harvesting minerals from mineral fields, and energy is produced by power plants. What makes the game unique and interesting is how you get the energy to the building that requires it. Energy moves from the power plants to other locations by jumping between energy links that you place, and you can improve the energy network by setting waypoints.<br/><br/>You also need to build defenses. Lots of defenses! The aliens are out to get you! They must be stopped with Laser Towers, Missile Turrets and over-charged bombs that you place and power up with energy. The laser towers can be linked together to improve their range and damage, and the missile turrets can be upgraded for different purposes. These defenses are needed, because the aliens are equipped with ten distinct units, each that require different priorities and counter-measures.<br/><br/>Your objective is to try to stay alive for as long as possible. Compete on the extensive online high-score lists, form player groups that battle against other groups, or simply try to beat your own record on each of the game&rsquo;s planets.

Archon III was never published by Electronic Arts or any other company, nor was it ever formally reviewed by a video game magazine. It was, however, freely copied amongst Commodore 64 users. The creators of Archon III borrowed heavily from the original Archon title and credit screens, crediting Electronic Arts as publisher, and Anne Westfall, Jon Freeman, and Paul Reiche IV (Paul Reiche III developed Archon and Archon II) as the authors. This initially confused many people who saw the game into believing that it was an official sequel. The most telling sign of its forgery however, was the title screen editing of &quot;Free Fall Associates&quot;. The word &quot;Fall&quot; was replaced with &quot;Fuck&quot; by Archon IIIs authors.<br/><br/>The noticeable lack of quality in Archon III added further proof of its unofficial status. In Archon III, players fought with sluggishly moving, sprite characters in the game's combat sequences. The battles did not involve the use of melee or projectiles but rather a circle of &quot;fire&quot; (similar to the Banshee character in the original Archon) that could reduce the health of the other player should it make contact. Different characters all moved and acted based on weighted strategy, thus winning was based on choosing right characters. Any kind of board game strategy plays, a feature which existed in the original Archon games, was completely non-existent. There was no single player mode or computer AI, meaning that it was strictly a two-player game, unlike either official Archon game.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Archon III,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "105474": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Antago", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"119800": "Amiga EU Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1072438.png", "videogametheme": {"2415": "Mythology"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2165": "Puzzle"}, "videogameplatform": {"4415": "Amiga"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1072438_t.png", "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>Angels and Daemons give themselves up to Antago, the celestial game in order to break the monotony of eternity.

A rogue, strong warrior type, and good-aligned cleric are all extremely valuable in this adventure, druids will be especially useful in the Hollow Mountain and have the greatest motivation to participate in it.

On their way to rescue the victims, the PCs encounter a wounded and scared satyr who tells them that plants and sylvan creatures in the area are corrupted by some vile infl uence that must be destroyed before the whole forest turns on its inhabitants. As they proceed the PCs are attacked by strange and hostile plant creatures that resemble man-sized flowers with dagger-like petals and groups of elven fanatics armed with poisonous arrows. These fanatics claim to be leading a holy war against the unnatural and corrupted civilization and the &ldquo;false&rdquo; that produced it.<br/><br/>Once inside the mountain the PCs must brave cave after cave of different misshapen enemies, mutant elves and their animalistic masters and prehistoric plants and monsters. Finally, they pass into a nightmarish plane through a portal opened ages ago by highly-advanced lizardfolk who once occupied the Hollow Mountain and experimented with powerful magic in its higher levels. There they face the unlikely master of this insane unholy war, the Tree That Sees, a tree-like aberration from before the dawn of time that threatens to spill its madness into the world.<br/><br/>"}, "105489": {"rpg": {"1652": "Labyrinth Lord"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Skull Mountain", "rpgproducer": {"51511": "Shelley Harlan"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1089332.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "rpgitemversion": {"158085": "PDF Version"}, "average": "5.33333", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1089332_t.jpg", "description": "From the publishers website:<br/><br/>When a rock formation on an old volcano looks like a human skull, you&rsquo;re gonna get cult activity.
