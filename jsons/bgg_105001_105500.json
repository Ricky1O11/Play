Which is scarier: zombies or werewolves? For generations this has puzzled commoner and philosopher alike. But now, the question will be answered. Which supernatural entity has the power to cause the most terror in the unsuspecting citizens of some nameless town? Only you can decide.<br/><br/>Zombies vs Werewolves is a fast-paced card game for 2 players that takes roughly 15 minutes (or less) to play. It&rsquo;s simple, competitive, and all about determining who can score the most Terror Points before the game ends by frightening an assortment of random Citizens.<br/><br/>Play begins by selecting 6 Citizen cards at random and laying them out on the table face up. Each person chooses one deck of cards (either Zombies or Werewolves) to play with. During each player's turn, they will be able to play a card from their hand and then draw back up to a hand limit of 5 cards. Cards played are either Terror cards (cards with a number from 2-6 and 8) or Special Event cards (unique cards with special abilities that can be used once a game each). Each side plays Terror cards on Citizens to try and meet or exceed the Citizen's Courage rating; the player that meets or exceeds the Courage rating first frightens that Citizen and prevents the other player from claiming them at the end of the game. Play continues until all Citizen cards have been frightened. Then the total Terror points played on all frightened Citizens is added up on each side.<br/><br/>The player with the most Terror Points at the end will be declared the victor, proving once and for all (or until you play again) that their side is the scarier of the two.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "Kickstarter special cover edition"], "age": "10", "name": "Zombies vs Werewolves", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "average": "6.92857", "usersrated": "14", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "105004": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Christophe Boelinger"], "poll": [], "name": "Sarena", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "53", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1066834_t.jpg", "average": "6.33292", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ludically"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The Spiel at Essen 2011 - Christophe Boelinger"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1066834.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual first edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Sarena is an abstract game involving strategy and bluffing.<br/>You find more details in german and french on the asmodee website.<br/><br/>"}, "105005": {"rpgartist": ["Joao Bosco", "Michael John Cugley", "Raven Daegmorgan", "Roberto Enachev", "Tony Lone Fight", "Kevin Haggard", "Herman Lau", "Yanick Moreau", "Josh Nordin", "Robert Shaffer", "David Tisch"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Dregoth Ascending: Part I \u2013 The Day of Light", "rpgdesigner": ["Kevin Melka", "Jon Sederquist"], "rpgproducer": ["Gabriel Cormier", "Jon Sederquist"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1103617.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Dark Sun"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["The Burnt World of Athas"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1103617_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher's web site:<br/><br/>The Dread King walks the surface world again.<br/><br/>An Army of Light decends upon one of the seven, and casts it into Darkness.<br/><br/>And the blood of thousands of unbelievers runs in rivers at the feet of he who would be a god.<br/><br/>    Part 1: The Day of Light<br/>    Part 2: The Quest<br/>    Part 3: The Ascension<br/> In order to play Dregoth Ascending, you will need The Dungeon Masters Guide, Player's Handbook, Monster Manual, and the Expanded Psionics Handbook, as well as the Dark Sun 3 Core rules and Terrors of Athas, available as free downloads from the official Dark Sun web site athas.org.

Unfortunately, the river also contributed to its troubles, because in 881, the Normans traversed its watery path, and thereby easily captured the city. That act of aggression stunted Tournay's prosperity. This game invites you to participate in the reconstruction of the city, in order to establish a glorious era that will last for more than seven centuries. Help your district flourish by cleverly coordinating the work of the city's three domains: military, religious, and civil. Certainly the prestige of your buildings will brighten the entire city!<br/><br/>Tournay is a card game from the same designing team as the 2010 release Troyes with artwork once again by Alexandre Roche. In this game, players manage a district of the city and its three classes of citizens. The cards are classified by level (I to III) and color to form nine distinct decks. Players initially have two citizens in each class that they will use each turn to carry out one of five available actions, such as drawing cards, or using the powers of their buildings.<br/><br/>In each player's district, the building cards save them money, make more efficient use of the decks of cards, or recruit new citizens. The character cards optimize the use of buildings if properly positioned. It's up to you to create the most effective card combinations. Finally, constructed prestige buildings will give you valuable prestige points, depending on how your district has developed. But beware: Your opponents will also benefit from every prestige building you build!<br/><br/>Note that an expansion is included in the base game's box, so advanced players can add still more replay value to this dynamic game!<br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>There are 3 sets of cards (yellow, red, white) in 3 groups (I, II, III); also, a set of black event cards. There are always 3 face-up event cards, most of which are bad. Players start with 2 meeples in 3 colors (yellow, red, white), placed on their Plaza card.<br/><br/>On your turn:<br/><br/>     First, you may play a card from hand to your display (3x3 grid) by paying the appropriate cost (some combination of coins, meeples, cards, etc). You may play a card on top of another of the same color; if played on top of a different color, discard the older card. <br/>     Then take one action:<br/>         Draw a card; move 1-3 meeples off the Plaza to draw a level I-III card; you may pay others 2 coins to use their worker(s). If you draw the event card of that deck, place a coin on each event card, then trigger all event cards once per coin.<br/>         Activate a building card by moving a meeple from your Plaza to the building card (max 1 Meeple/building); cards do a variety of things like give you coins, recruit an additional meeple, use someone else's card, etc.<br/>         Combat an event by paying the cost (usually 1 Meeple, 1 coin, +1/coin on the card; or, 2 meeples) shown; take the card as a reward. Later, when events trigger, you may play this from hand to prevent an event from affecting you.<br/>         Reactivate all workers: return all meeples to your Plaza, and remove all markers from building cards.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The game ends at the start of the Start Player's turn if 2+ players have all 9 cards in their display; OR if only 1 player has, but at least n-1 Town Crier cards have been revealed. Everyone then gets to play one final card (paying normal costs). Earn VPs for all cards in display, and for all Event cards you've combated.

The turret can swivel to cover a large area of the screen, but cannot move from its base. Helicopters fly across the screen at varying heights, progressively lower over time, dropping paratroopers. The gun may fire multiple shots at once, and the shots may destroy helicopters or shoot paratroopers. Optionally the gun can also control its shots after they are fired (an initial game setting).<br/><br/>Paratroopers may be disintegrated by a direct hit, or their parachutes may be shot, in which case they will plummet to earth (splattering and dying if they were sufficiently high when the shot hit, scoring on impact). If they land on a previously landed paratrooper, that paratrooper is also killed. If a falling paratrooper collides with another paratrooper in the air, the lower paratrooper loses his parachute and falls (occasionally two paratroopers from different helicopters can collide causing only the lower one to fall to his death). Furthermore, destroyed helicopters turn into shrapnel, which may destroy other helicopters, paratroopers, or parachutes. Periodically, jets may fly by and drop bombs; the jets may be shot as well, but the bombs must be shot as they unerringly home in on your turret.<br/><br/>Waves consist of helicopters coming at progressively lower altitudes, a brief rest, then a wave of jets. If the jet wave is survived, there is a short respite, then the next round of helicopters begins with an extra row of helicopters on the first run. The next jet wave also has an extra row of jets and the potential of having bombs dropping from two directions. Paratroopers will not deploy their parachutes until they drop below the last row of flying helicopters.<br/><br/>The player earns points by shooting helicopters (5 points), paratroopers (2 points), jets (5 points), and bombs (25 points). Firing a shell costs the player one point, so if one is playing for score, there is an incentive to conserve ammo. The score never drops below zero.<br/><br/>The game ends when the player's turret is hit by a bomb, when a single paratrooper lands directly on the turret base, when three paratroopers safely land atop each other immediately adjacent to the turret base (allowing the third to jump onto the base), or when four paratroopers safely land on either the left or right of the turret (that is four on one side, not four total). If four land on a side, they are able to build a human pyramid and climb up to the turret and blow it up once the sky is clear. There is a chance to kill the paratroopers before they assault the turret if you can cause still-airborne paratroopers to fall without parachutes on enough ground forces to reduce them to fewer than four on a side, fewer than three stacked by the turret base, or remove all from atop the base. They will not perform the final assault until all airborne forces are gone.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabotage_%28video_game%29,&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabotage_%28video_game%29,&quot</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "105099": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic202363.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ryan Dancey", "Matt Staroscik", "D.

Who will flirt the best, gain the most flirting points and become the &quot;best&quot; couple?<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player receives a character (or two characters in a three-player game), two hearts belonging to that character and two relationship tokens, and a pawn, which is placed on the board. Then, each player thinks up a term of endearment for himself. When players address each other, they should use this term of endearment. A player who fails to do so correctly loses a relationship point.<br/><br/>The game is played in turns. On his turn, a player rolls two dice, picks one, and move his pawn as many spaces as the die shows. (In a three-player game, the player rolls one die, and selects one of his pawns to move.) After moving the pawn, the player may flirt with one character of the opposite sex whose pawn is on the same space or an adjacent space. If he does so, this strengthens the relationship between the two characters. This is measured by placing flirting points on the &quot;love barometer&quot;. If two characters have four flirting points, they fall in love. After four more points, they get engaged, and after another four points, they get married.<br/><br/>Furthermore, if the pawn has landed on a heart space, the player may either give one of his hearts to another player, or ask for a heart from another player (who then has to give one of his hearts to the asker).<br/><br/>If the pawn has landed on a text message space, the player draws one of the text message cards, reads it out loud and places it face-down in front of him.

Details on why this is important in the description.<br/><br/>Risk Legacy represents what is if not a new, at least a rare concept to boardgaming: campaigning. At its core, the game, particularly at first, plays much like regular Risk with a few changes. Players control countries or regions on a map of the world, and through simple combat (with players rolling dice to determine who loses units in each battle) they try to eliminate all opponents from the game board or control a certain number of &quot;red stars&quot;, otherwise known as victory points (VPs).<br/><br/>What's different is that Risk Legacy' changes over time based on the outcome of each game and the various choices made by players. In each game, players choose one of five factions; each faction has uniquely shaped pieces, and more importantly, different rules. At the start of the first game, each of these factions gains the ability to break one minor rule, such as the ability to move troops at any time during your turn, as opposed to only at the end.<br/><br/>What makes this game unique is that when powers are chosen, players must choose one of their faction's two powers, affix that power's sticker to their faction card, then destroy the card that has the other rule on it &ndash; and by destroy, the rules mean what they say: &quot;If a card is DESTROYED, it is removed from the game permanently. Rip it up. Throw it in the trash.&quot; This key concept permeates through the game. Some things you do in a game will affect it temporarily, while others will affect it permanently. These changes may include boosting the resources of a country (for recruiting troops in lieu of the older &quot;match three symbols&quot; style of recruiting), adding bonuses or penalties to defending die rolls to countries, or adding permanent continent troop bonuses that may affect all players.<br/><br/>The rule book itself is also designed to change as the game continues, with blocks of blank space on the pages to allow for rules additions or changes. Entire sections of rules will not take effect until later in the game. The game box contains different sealed packages and compartments, each with a written condition for opening. The rule book indicates that these contain the rule additions, additional faction powers, and other things that should not be discussed here for spoiler protection.<br/><br/>The winner of each of the first 15 games receives a &quot;major bonus,&quot; such as founding a major city (which only he will be allowed to start on in future games), deleting a permanent modifier from the board, destroying a country card (preventing it from providing any resources towards purchasing troops in future games), changing a continent troop bonus, or naming a continent, which gives that player a troop bonus in future games. Players who did not win but were not eliminated are allowed to make minor changes to the world, such as founding a minor city or adding resources to a country.<br/><br/>It should be noted that although cards are ripped up over the course of the game, there are so many cards added via the sealed packages, that the game does not suffer.

It is played on the cells of an initially empty hex hex board. The suggested size is between 6 and 10 cells per side. Both players must have access to a sufficient number of black and white stones.<br/><br/><br/>Definitions<br/><br/>A group is a set of connected, like-colored stones. A single stone is also a group.<br/><br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>Starting with Black, players take turns placing one or two stones of any color on empty cells. On their first turn, Black can only place one stone.<br/><br/>At the end of each turn, there must be an odd number of groups on the board (i.e. the sum of the number of Black and White groups must be an odd number).<br/><br/>Players can pass their turn at any moment, unless it violates the previous rule (this means Black can't pass on their first turn).<br/><br/>When both players pass in succession, the game ends. The player with the fewest groups on the board wins. Draws are not possible.<br/><br/><br/>Notes<br/><br/>Double placement serves both as a first move equalizer and a way to make the game playable under the group restriction rule.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, apart from the intended goal of eliminating draws (they would be common otherwise), forcing an odd number of groups at the end of a turn has some interesting tactical implications which make the game feel similar to a single placement game. For example, groups separated by two empty cells can't be joined on a single turn, since the player runs out of stones to restore the groups count to an odd number. Also, the diamond connection (two stones at each end of a four-cell rhombus) is safe if the opponent has exactly zero or two groups adjacent to the intermediate cells, and unsafe otherwise.<br/><br/>Endgames are also quite tricky under this rule: you'll often want to join two of your own groups or create another opponent group, but you'll be unable to do it because you can't restore the groups count anymore!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "Yodd", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Paper-and-Pencil", "Pattern Recognition", "Tile Placement"], "average": "7.40909", "usersrated": "11", "boardgamefamily": ["Combinatorial", "Connection Games"]}, "105174": {"poll": [], "name": "Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European PlayStation 3 edition", "English/European PlayStation Vita edition", "German PlayStation 3 edition", "German PlayStation Vita edition", "North American PlayStation 3 edition", "North American PlayStation Vita edition"], "average": "6.42857", "videogameseries": ["Sly Cooper"], "videogametheme": ["Furries / Talking Animals", "Spy / Espionage"], "usersrated": "7", "videogamedeveloper": ["Sanzaru Games Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 3", "PlayStation Vita"], "videogamehonor": ["2013 Global Game Awards Best Platformer Game of the Year Nominee"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "description": "Sly Cooper&reg; and the whole gang return with an epic brand new adventure for the PlayStation&reg;3 system.

Forming the core of Lions of the Rock are the formidable members of the Lannister family: the ruthless patriarch Tywin, the treacherous queen Cersei, the Kingslayer Jaime, and the beguiling Tyrion. Each wields power as naturally as dragons breathe fire, backed by the limitless wealth of Casterly Rock and the unbreakable will of House Lannister's honor and willingness to repay any debt in blood.

It features Wally Week as the central character. Pyjamarama is an arcade adventure set across several interconnecting rooms. The player takes the role of Wally, who has gone to bed for the night and has to wake up early in the morning for work. Unfortunately, his alarm clock has not been wound, and thus he will sleep late in the morning, and his boss will fire him. However, in his sleep, Wally's consciousness travels around his home, and other places, wearing his pyjamas, in search for the key to rewind the alarm clock and wake himself up.<br/><br/>The game is made up of static single-screen rooms, each of which can include platforms in various arrangements, objects to pick up, and enemies to avoid. Wally can walk through the screens to progress through the game's map and to pick up objects. Wally can only carry two items at a time, so each time he picks up an item, he drops an old item in its place. Contact with an enemy drains Wally's &quot;snooze energy&quot;, and if it runs out, Wally loses one of his &quot;lives&quot;. When all three &quot;lives&quot; are lost, Wally returns to sleep and doesn't wake up until late in the morning, losing the game.<br/><br/>Pyjamarama can be played either with a joystick or with the keyboard. Only three controls are needed: walk left, walk right, and jump.<br/><br/>A remake of Pyjamarama was released for Windows and Mac OS in 2005.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyjamarama,&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyjamarama,&quot</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "105263": {"rpgartist": ["Ralf Berszuck", "Zoltan Boros", "Caryad", "Ina Kramer", "G\u00e1bor Szikszai", "Sabine Weiss"], "rpgitemversion": ["Corrected Version (2005)", "First German Printing"], "statistics": [], "name": "Das Schwarze Auge", "rpgdesigner": ["Florian Don-Schauen", "Momo Evers", "Ralf Hlawatsch", "Stefan K\u00fcppers", "Britta Neigel (Mechthild Henschel)", "Thomas R\u00f6mer"], "rpgproducer": ["Ralf Berszuck", "Florian Don-Schauen", "Ina Kramer", "Britta Neigel (Mechthild Henschel)", "Thomas R\u00f6mer"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic541639.jpg", "usersrated": "5", "rpgsetting": ["Aventurien"], "average": "6.6", "rpgissuearticle": ["Murmeleien & M\u00e4usejagd", "Rezensionen"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Fanpro"], "rpg": ["Das Schwarze Auge (DSA) (4th Edition)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic541639_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>This boxed set provides the core rules of the 4th edition of Das Schwarze Auge along with basic information about the continent of Aventurien.<br/><br/>Two introductory adventures, Efferdors Fluch and Auf Leben und Tod, are also provided, as are maps, dice and character sheets.<br/><br/>Most of the information has since been duplicated in the game's various expansions, making it a good starting point that can become largely redundant for those who expand their collections.<br/><br/>"}, "105264": {"poll": [], "name": "Twisty Tracks", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Worldwide downloadable release"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Puzzle"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["MumboJumbo"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade", "Puzzle", "Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["MumboJumbo"], "description": "Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>A mighty windstorm has scattered your treasure trove to the far reaches of the world!<br/>Guide your train across the vast Realm of D'roso to recover every last gem.

Es un juego de rol de fantas&iacute;a donde t&uacute;, el jugador, interpretas a un personaje ficticio en un mundo fant&aacute;stico (y si eres el director de juego, normalmente<br/>abreviado como DJ, puedes interpretar a montones de personajes diferentes).<br/>La mejor analog&iacute;a la brinda Ron Edwards, un dise&ntilde;ador de juegos que sabe lo que hace. Edwards compara un juego de rol con tocar en una banda: los miembros se juntan y deciden qu&eacute; tipo de m&uacute;sica quieren interpretar.<br/>Una persona (el DJ) gu&iacute;a, y el resto de los miembros aportan lo que pueden para crear algo que es, idealmente, lo que desean. Es como tocar m&uacute;sica en una banda: un miembro puede encontrar un riff excelente<br/>que nadie esperaba pero al que todos se acoplar&aacute;n.<br/>Donjon es como una sesi&oacute;n de acid jazz. Est&aacute; hecho para darle control a los jugadores: pueden iniciar un solo de guitarra o bater&iacute;a cuando lo deseen. Si algo suena bien, entonces pueden continuar. Aqu&iacute; no hay un l&iacute;der de la banda que vaya a cortarte el rollo.&quot;<br/><br/>In english from google translation:<br/><br/>&quot;Welcom to Donjon! You might be a experienced rpg player and want to try this game, or maybe this is your first RPG. Anyway, read on.<br/>Donjon is an exciting do-it-yourself type game in which you kick doors, explore dark dungeons (or as we like to call: donjons), kill monsters, find treasure and save all. It is a fantasy role-playing game where you, the player, play a fictional character in a fantasy world (and if you are the director of game, usually<br/>abbreviated as DJ, you can play lots of different characters).<br/>The best analogy is provided by Ron Edwards, a game designer who knows what he does. Edwards compares a role playing game with playing in a band: the members get together and decide what kind of music they want to interpret.<br/>A person (the DJ) guide, and other members contribute what they can to create something that is ideally what you want. It's like playing music in a band: a member can find a great riff<br/>than anyone expected but we all engage.<br/>Donjon is like an acid jazz session. It is meant to give players control: they can start a single guitar or drums any time. If something sounds good, then you can continue. Here there is not a gang leader who will cut your roll.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "105305": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1490683.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Andreas Frei", "Ueli Frei", "Lukas Frei"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Andreas Frei", "Ueli Frei", "Jo Hartwig"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Queen Games"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1490683_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Children's Game", "Farming"], "boardgamehonor": ["2012 Spiel des Jahres Kinderspiel Recommended"], "description": "Publisher's description:<br/><br/>Frank the farmer is proud of the delicious apples, pears, cherries and plums that grow in his garden.

There is generally a question as to what a character would be able to find and subsequently purchase with the Resource they find. Under most circumstances, the rules in the book are more than sufficient at covering a broad range of common items that can be found in the garage, storeroom, behind counters, etc. But this may not be enough for the GM who knows a location well enough to know precisely what is available and in roughly what quantity. Also, a GM who desires to inspire a higher degree of fear in their players by making certain resources extremely finite (even those that are otherwise common) would benefit from adapting the rules in the Outbreak: Undead core rulebook to incorporate such a frightening reality. An entirely optional, but efficient, way to accomplish this is by using a &quot;Resource Catalog&quot;.<br/><br/>A &quot;Resource Catalog&quot; is a list of what a character is able to purchase with their available Resource. What is on this list is based on the locations that the characters loot during missions or what kind of location they are in when the game starts. For most scenarios, the items are automatically added to the catalog once the location is successfully searched. The master list that a can be purchased from when characters are in their Stronghold is the &quot;Strongohld Resource Catalog&quot;.

The game is a combination of side-scrolling action mixed in with some puzzles.

The game had an overhead map of various locations in the city that the player can travel to, with animated scenes, but then the gameplay would switch to a more traditional side-scrolling adventure game.<br/><br/>Superman has an energy (Super Power) bar and he can collect various icons in the game to use a limited supply of one of his item powers: x-ray vision (make certain enemies visible), superflight, super spin, heat vision (laser attack), and ice breath 1 and ice breath 2 (freeze enemies). One of the main difference from the comics was that Superman's x-ray vision was used to make invisible enemies visible. The instruction booklet explained that glitch by claiming that &quot;Superman is now unable to see inside buildings, as Lex has lined all the buildings in Metropolis with lead!&quot; Aside from the item powers, Superman can also jump and punch. Players start out the game as Clark Kent but can change into Superman (provided that they have enough Super Power) by entering into one of the phone booths that are scattered throughout the city. However, taking sufficient damage from enemies would cause Superman to become Clark Kent. Whenever Superman entered the Daily Planet building he would always revert to Clark Kent, no matter what his power level was. The game also came with an area map that split up the districts of Metropolis and allowed Superman to use his superflight power to quickly change areas. Occasionally a &quot;Help!&quot; signal would appear on the map, such as a person being mugged, to which Superman could fly to that area immediately and aid the person in need.<br/><br/>At the end of each city level, or &quot;chapter&quot;, the player battles a different boss and, upon defeating the boss, is given an animated front page of a Daily Planet newspaper praising their success. The second to the last chapter boss in the game is Lex Luthor. This is followed by three fights in a row against the exiled criminals from Krypton; Ursa, Non and General Zod at the &quot;Statue of Freedom&quot;, which looks like the Statue of Liberty.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Superman (Kemco game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "105390": {"videogame": ["Aeria Games Power Collection"], "poll": [], "name": "Shaiya", "videogamemode": ["Massively Multiplayer"], "videogameversion": ["Windows downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1091289.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Aeria Games"], "videogamegenre": ["MMO"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Aeria Games"], "videogamecompilation": ["Aeria Games Power Collection"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1091289_t.jpg", "description": "Shaiya is a stunning free-to-play fantasy MMORPG that immerses players in a massive war between the forces of Light and Darkness.

While the game was intended to be the first in a franchise, no sequels were released.<br/><br/>The NES version of the game is unique from its computer counterparts in that it has a on-screen hearts designating hit detection, but eliminates the two-player mode, one of the carnival levels and requires the player to complete each level with a specific character. The initial levels, which you can complete in any order, are as follows;<br/><br/>Kermit the Frog rides an inner tube down a river, Fozzie Bear must escape a Fun House of desserts, Gonzo flies a space ship and Animal drives a bumper car. After completing these initial levels, the player then controls Kermit the Frog, armed with a feather, in Dr. Grump's castle.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muppet_Adventure' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muppet_Adventure</a>:_Chaos_at_the_Carnival,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "105406": {"poll": [], "name": "Ridge Racer V", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["European PlayStation 2 edition", "Japanese PlayStation 2 edition", "North American PlayStation 2 edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1121420.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Ridge Racer"], "videogametheme": ["Driving"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Namco Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Racing"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2"], "videogamehonor": ["2001 D.I.C.E.

In this 2D fantasy you take on the role as the base commander of a space colony far, far away, and must use five building types in a creative way to efficiently expand and defend it. Build power plants, mineral harvesters and defense towers and make sure they have sufficient energy to fend off endless hordes of evil aliens. The game offers a vast array of possible strategies with these simple rules, and will compel you to try new and better base designs every time.<br/><br/>The fundamental gameplay action of Harvest: Massive Encounter is to place buildings that cost credits and energy. Credits are gained by harvesting minerals from mineral fields, and energy is produced by power plants. What makes the game unique and interesting is how you get the energy to the building that requires it. Energy moves from the power plants to other locations by jumping between energy links that you place, and you can improve the energy network by setting waypoints.<br/><br/>You also need to build defenses. Lots of defenses! The aliens are out to get you! They must be stopped with Laser Towers, Missile Turrets and over-charged bombs that you place and power up with energy. The laser towers can be linked together to improve their range and damage, and the missile turrets can be upgraded for different purposes.

The player enters a series of high-speed chases in which they must squeeze between trucks, fend off the gang members, perform dangerous stunts, commit acts of vehicular homicide, and narrowly escapes death before facing off against the gang's female leader. The player controls the cross-hair to steer their car toward the correct directions according to the green arrows flashing and beeping beside it, while controlling the gas pedal, brake and booster whenever they light up.<br/><br/>Various ports were released for consoles between 1989 and 1997 including versions for the MSX, Mega CD/Sega CD, Sega Saturn, PlayStation, LaserActive Mega LD/Sega LD, and 3DO Interactive Multiplayer (prototyped as Turbo Blaster). However, only the Sega CD and Sega LD versions were released internationally under the titles Road Avenger, and Road Prosecuter respectively. The titles were presumably changed to avoid confusion with the similarly titled arcade game Roadblasters by Atari Games (which was ported to the Sega Genesis around the same time). Other variations included one-shot reproductions for VHS cassette players such as Takara&rsquo;s Video Challenger which was a limited interactive port of the Road Blaster arcade game. The Sega Saturn and PlayStation ports were compilations of Road Blaster and another laserdisc arcade game developed by the same team titled as Thunder Storm (known outside of Japan as Cobra Command).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Road Blaster&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "105453": {"videogame": ["Cobra Command", "Road Blaster"], "poll": [], "name": "Thunder Storm LX-3 & Road Blaster", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US Playstation edition", "US Sega Saturn edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Driving", "Flight", "Military"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Data East", "Ecseco"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure", "Flight Simulator"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation", "SEGA Saturn"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Ecseco"], "videogamecompilation": ["Cobra Command", "Road Blaster"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A compilation of Thunder Storm (a.k.a.

Archon III was never published by Electronic Arts or any other company, nor was it ever formally reviewed by a video game magazine. It was, however, freely copied amongst Commodore 64 users. The creators of Archon III borrowed heavily from the original Archon title and credit screens, crediting Electronic Arts as publisher, and Anne Westfall, Jon Freeman, and Paul Reiche IV (Paul Reiche III developed Archon and Archon II) as the authors. This initially confused many people who saw the game into believing that it was an official sequel. The most telling sign of its forgery however, was the title screen editing of &quot;Free Fall Associates&quot;. The word &quot;Fall&quot; was replaced with &quot;Fuck&quot; by Archon IIIs authors.<br/><br/>The noticeable lack of quality in Archon III added further proof of its unofficial status. In Archon III, players fought with sluggishly moving, sprite characters in the game's combat sequences. The battles did not involve the use of melee or projectiles but rather a circle of &quot;fire&quot; (similar to the Banshee character in the original Archon) that could reduce the health of the other player should it make contact. Different characters all moved and acted based on weighted strategy, thus winning was based on choosing right characters. Any kind of board game strategy plays, a feature which existed in the original Archon games, was completely non-existent. There was no single player mode or computer AI, meaning that it was strictly a two-player game, unlike either official Archon game.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Archon III,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "105474": {"poll": [], "name": "Antago", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Amiga EU Edition", "Atari ST EU Edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1072438.png", "videogametheme": ["Mythology", "Puzzle"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "Atari ST"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Art Of Dreams"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1072438_t.png", "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>Angels and Daemons give themselves up to Antago, the celestial game in order to break the monotony of eternity.

A rogue, strong warrior type, and good-aligned cleric are all extremely valuable in this adventure, druids will be especially useful in the Hollow Mountain and have the greatest motivation to participate in it. A traditionally peaceful tribe of nomadic wood elves suddenly becomes hostile and starts raiding neighboring human settlements with murderous zeal. It seems that the main object of these raids is prisoner capturing and wanton, senseless destruction of any man-made objects.<br/><br/>The PCs are hired by the local baron to investigate the cause of this sudden change of heart in his former allies and soon discover that tribe has abandoned its traditional nomadic lifestyle and taken up residence inside a famous local landmark called the Hollow Mountain.<br/><br/>The Hollow Mountain is a very sharp, lone mountain that sticks from the dense forests of the region like a rotten tooth. It derives its name from the fact that it is almost completely empty inside. On their way to rescue the victims, the PCs encounter a wounded and scared satyr who tells them that plants and sylvan creatures in the area are corrupted by some vile infl uence that must be destroyed before the whole forest turns on its inhabitants. As they proceed the PCs are attacked by strange and hostile plant creatures that resemble man-sized flowers with dagger-like petals and groups of elven fanatics armed with poisonous arrows. These fanatics claim to be leading a holy war against the unnatural and corrupted civilization and the &ldquo;false&rdquo; that produced it.<br/><br/>Once inside the mountain the PCs must brave cave after cave of different misshapen enemies, mutant elves and their animalistic masters and prehistoric plants and monsters. Finally, they pass into a nightmarish plane through a portal opened ages ago by highly-advanced lizardfolk who once occupied the Hollow Mountain and experimented with powerful magic in its higher levels.
