Each pawn counts for one vote. But if players do not agree, the game goes on so more pawn will enter and both the number of votes and candidates will vary.

Includes SCARNEY, a skill game based on an entirely new game principle known as The Kaleidoscopic Principle; HIGH-LOW SCARNEY, the world's quickest ending skill game; SCARNEY CHECKERS, a checker style game wiht a Gin Rummy scoring; SCARNEY CHALLENGE, an unequaled point scoring track game; SOLITAIRE SCARNEY and MOKO SOLITAIRE, the two greatest all-skill solitaire board games ever invented. The perfect diversion for home and club.<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>The board consists of a 4 x 4 grid. The pieces are numbered 1-4 in four different colors (making 16 in all). In the basic game, each player removes a &quot;1&quot; piece, and then takes turns jumping and removing pieces (like in checkers, but orthogonally, not diagonally). Each piece that is jumped must be of a different color than the one which is moved.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player cannot make another move. If the remaining pieces are of different colors, the player who CANNOT move takes the remaining pieces and adds their total to his score. However, if the pieces are all of the SAME color, the PREVIOUS player (the one who made the last move) gets the points, plus a 10-point-per-piece bonus. If the remaining colors are all black, the bonus is increased to 20 points per piece.<br/><br/>Needless to say, there are numerous variations to these rules among the 39 other games that can be played with this set.<br/><br/>"}, "9525": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Ludi at the Circus Maximus", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1989", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic39672_t.jpg", "average": "3.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Discere, LTD."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic39672.jpg", "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Ancient", "Racing", "Word Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "A combination of a race and a word game.

At Stamford Bridge, the Viking invasion of England was repulsed by the Anglo-Saxon army, while three weeks later, at Senlac Hill, the Norman invaders successfully defeated the Anglo-Saxon army and were able to conquer the whole of England. The outcome of the Battle of Senlac Hill was a direct result of the Battle of Stamford Bridge. In a campaign game, players play the Battle of Stamford Bridge first. Then the Battle of Senlac Hill is played with an order of battle determined by the outcome of the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Either game may be played independently of the other.<br/><br/>1066 uses a revolutionary innovation in wargaming entitled the MOVEMENT RESOLUTION SYSTEM. There is no die to throw nor any card to choose. The result of an attack depends entirely upon how intelligently you move, not the luck of the die. The MOVEMENT RESOLUTION SYSTEM consists of the attacker moving adjacent to an enemy unit, then both players moving one hex simultaneously. The result of this move determines the result of the attack.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["TSR First Edition"], "name": "William the Conqueror: 1066", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "average": "6.73148", "usersrated": "27", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: England"]}, "9565": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic184684.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Gerard Christopher Klug"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1986", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "8", "boardgamepublisher": ["Victory Games (I)"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic184684_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Modern Warfare", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Novel-based", "Spies/Secret Agents"], "description": "Using the famous movie assault on the secret rocket base from  You Only Live Twice , the James Bond 007 Assault Game creates a unique opportunity for role players and simulation gamers to come together in a fast-paced, exciting game of commando combat!

One animal is hidden in each tube, and these tubes are then distributed evenly among the players.  Each player is also given two &quot;search cards&quot;; each of these cards depicts a set of four of the animals.  Players try to locate all of the animals on one or both of their cards by asking other players for the ones they need.  If the acting player asks someone for an animal they are holding, that tube is passed to the acting player; as a reward, they can continue asking for more animals.  However, if the player they asked DOES NOT have the animal, the player's turn ends.  Once a player has all the animals needed to complete one or both of his search cards, he can reveal the card(s) and the animals to score 1 or 2 points.

In fact, the longer it takes others to figure out your clay sculpture, the more points you get. However, you only get points if at least one person figures out your Cluzzle before the end of the game. This means you&rsquo;ll want your sculpture to be a little ambiguous, but not too ambiguous.<br/><br/>And this is exactly where the humor lies! The result is a hilarious game for all ages, where anyone can win and everyone will have fun. So grab your friends and family. Your ridiculously poor sculptures will inspire laughter that will be remembered for years to come!<br/><br/>Did you know that Alanis Morissette, Alan Moon, Stephen Glenn, Tom Vasel, and others created personalized Cluzzle Cards for the game?

But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.<br/><br/>Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).<br/><br/>Action dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal gameplay. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle.<br/><br/>Reimplemented by:<br/><br/>    War of the Ring Collector's Edition<br/>    War of the Ring (Second Edition)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Upgrade to the 2nd edition (Card Pack) <br/><br/>    War of the Ring (second edition): Upgrade Kit<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Asmodee French revised edition", "Devir Portuguese edition", "Devir Spanish edition", "Dutch Phalanx Edition", "Fantasy Flight English Edition", "Greek first edition", "Nexus Italian First Edition", "Phalanx Games German edition", "Tilsit French edition"], "average": "7.81653", "name": "War of the Ring (first edition)", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Area Control / Area Influence", "Area Movement", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["188886", "18034"], "usersrated": "8942", "boardgameaccessory": ["War of the Ring (second edition): Upgrade Kit"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Tolkien Games", "War of the Ring"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BGA Episode 100 - Top 100 Games of All Time", "Ep. 5 Theme", "Episode 26 - Francesco Nepitello; Co-designer of War of the Ring", "Episode 47 :: Colosseum Review - 1754 Conquest Review", "Episodio 11 \u2013 Especial verano 2013: Juegos no jugados", "ET87: El podcast es mio!", "Low Player Count - Ep 14 - Free Form", "Meeples &amp; Miniatures - Episode #41", "Point 2 Point Episode 8 - Pseudocon Session Reports and Jerry Taylor", "RJ58: Co\u00f1os, ninjas y uzis", "Show #19: Lord of the Rings Extravaganza", "The Spiel #59 - There and Back Again", "\uc81c83\ud68c \uac8c\uc784 \ub300 \uac8c\uc784 - \ubc18\uc9c0 \uc804\uc7c1 vs. \uc655\uc88c\uc758 \uac8c\uc784"]}, "9610": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic283623.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Rennfieber"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Dan Glimne"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1982", "maxplayers": "6", "age": "10", "boardgamepublisher": ["Alga", "danspil"], "maxplaytime": "180", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic283623_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Dice", "Racing", "Sports"], "description": "This harness racing game is one of a number of Alga games that deals with horses and horse racing. See also J\u00e4gersro and M\u00e5nvalla med V5.<br/><br/>A full game consists of six starts divided into three phases (2 starts each). Before each phase, horses are auctioned off to the players; each player gets 2, 4 or 6 horses depending on the number of players. After each phase, players can keep only one horse from the preceding phases, the rest are auctioned off again. Auction is followed by training which is played on a short &quot;training track&quot; on the game board; here the horses can get better - each horse has a value from -5 to +5 which will help/hinder in the roll-and-move race - and the players may also get cards for later use during the actual race.<br/><br/>Results of the training define starting positions for the race and also give some clue as to each horse's capabilities, so now it's time for betting. A player can bet on up to 2-3 horses, depending on the number of players; betting is secret, and a player can freely bet on any horses, including their opponents'.<br/><br/>The actual race is conducted as roll-and-move using 2 dice. A special die is used for moving the horses, adding or subtracting their individual modifiers, and a regular d6 is used to determine if a player must pick a race card (on 1 or 6). These affect the race directly and often quite drastically; some may be saved for later use.<br/><br/>After the race the winning horse gets it's modifier increased by one step, all bets are revealed, money paid out from the bank and preparations made for the next race. Horses that competed in a race may not compete in the immediate next one - this is why the players have several. After the 2nd and 4th races, the auction phase is repeated.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, a bonus is paid to players who managed to bet on the winning horse in 5 or 6 races, any bank loans are paid back, and winner is the player with most money.<br/><br/>Approximate play sequence:<br/><br/>1) Auction - buy a number of horses<br/>2) Train them for the race<br/>3) Select horses for race 1<br/>4) Betting phase<br/>5) Run short race<br/>6) Pay winner, both race and betting money.<br/>7) Repeat 3-6, but with long race<br/>8) repeat 1-6 twice<br/>9) Pay bonus to anyone who has picked the winner in at least 5 of the 6 races.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Alga Swedish Edition"], "name": "Travspelet med V65", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Betting/Wagering", "Dice Rolling", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Variable Phase Order"], "average": "5.74921", "usersrated": "63", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Sports: Horse Racing"]}, "9611": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Boggle Jr. Numbers", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "1992", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": ["Boggle"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic90132_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Children's Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic90132.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Parker Brothers Edition"], "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamepublisher": ["Parker Brothers"], "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game"], "age": "3", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Boggle Jr. Numbers is a childrens game for Ages 3 - 6.

Build armies and fleets, make alliances, establish colonies, improve your economy, and ultimately wage war to expand your empire.  Be careful, though, as a profligate country can end up being consumed by revolution.<br/><br/>From the designer:<br/>Think of Civilization/Age of Renaissance set in the 18th century. Players take the role of one of the major powers of the period and fight in both Europe and the colonies. The twist to the game is that in each war, players must form into two alliances. Once allied with a player, you cannot fight each other. This means that you do not have the backstabbing of Diplomacy to worry about; if he's allied, he's with you until the end of the war. This means that a player has to think carefully about who he wants to fight against and who he wants to ally with. Very often he will want to ally with his natural enemy and go to war with the guy who doesn't really want to fight him. On top of this, you have lots of improvement tiles that you buy to shape your empire, plus alliances with minor powers, and the possibility of going into revolution.

It takes  LUCK  to draw the right card at the right time, BRAINS  to remember cards you only see once, and  COURAGE  to save for a FOUR SQUARE call.

The other is to build a hand with four-of-a-kind. During the play, hands are kept face down on the table and arranged in a square, hence the name &quot;FOUR SQUARE.&quot; In either case, the losing players' scores are increased by the number of the points in their hands, in some cases doubled or tripled, as later described.

Using this mechanism, players try to craft a path to the top of the tower that can't be used by others or use their ball as a blocking point to keep someone off the level you need.<br/><br/>"}, "9643": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Werner Falkhof", "Michael Sohre"], "poll": [], "name": "Cubicado", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "1996", "usersrated": "18", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic74823_t.jpg", "average": "6.08889", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Theta"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic74823.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "The cubes are shaken out arbitrarily onto the board, making a pyramid.

A player may choose to move between one and six spaces clockwise around the board.  The player then follows any special instructions written on the space that he or she lands on (these include collecting a Dirty Tricks Card, collecting a cash handout from the Hush Fund, calling a Press Conference, using the Shredder, hiding in a Safe House, or Passing The Buck).  A non-player character, the Journalist, is moved the same number of spaces clockwise around the board.  If the journalist lands on a space occupied by another player, one of that player's three scandals is placed in the middle of the board and auctioned off to the highest bidder.  The player who wins the scandal card may then try to expose it by first landing on a Press Conference square, and then making an accusation against the player whose scandal it is.  The accuser may choose to blackmail the accused and accept a cash payment in exchange for a temporary reprieve, or the players contest the accusation using Dirty Tricks.  If the accusation is successful, the scandal is removed from the game and the accuser gets $50 Million as a reward.  If unsuccessful, the accused gets a scandal back and receives $10 Million compensation.  Once all a player's scandals are exposed, he or she is out of the game.  If the player who owns the scandal gets to The Shredder before being accused at a Press Conference, he or she takes the unexposed scandal back.

Each player has a rack with six tiles on it, and on a turn a player places one tile from her rack onto two hexes of the game board. For each hex on this tile, she scores one point in that color for each hex of the same color that lies adjacent to it and each hex in a straight line from it. If a player brings the score of a color to 18, she immediately takes another turn. At the end of her turn, she refills her rack to six tiles. (Before refilling her rack, if she has no tiles on it that contain hexes in her lowest-scoring color, she can discard all of her tiles, then draw six new tiles from the bag.)<br/><br/>When no more tiles can be placed on the game board or when one player scores 18 in each color, the game ends. Players then compare their lowest scores, and whoever has the highest low score wins.<br/><br/>Ingenious includes rules for solitaire and team play; in the latter case, two teams of two play, with each player not being able to see his partner's tiles and teams keeping a combined score that maxes out at 36 instead of 18.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["999 Games Dutch First edition", "999 Games Dutch Second edition", "Bard Polish Edition", "Brain Games Baltic edition", "Damm Norwegian edition", "Devir Spanish edition", "Devir Spanish red box edition", "Devir Spanish/Portuguese little red box edition", "Egmont Litas Danish edition", "English edition 2017", "Esdevium Games English edition 2012", "Fantasy Flight Games edition with Spiel des Jahres and Spiel der Spiele logos", "Fantasy Flight Games English edition", "Fantasy Flight Games English red box edition 2010", "Fantasy Flight Games English red box edition 2012", "Filosofia edition", "Green Board Game Co. blue box edition", "Green Board Game Co. red box edition", "Italian edition", "Kaissa Greek edition", "Kaissa Greek First edition", "Kaissa Greek Second edition", "Karnan Swedish edition", "Kirjalito Finnish edition", "Kosmos German \"kurze regal einfach spielen\" edition", "KOSMOS German 10th anniversary edition 2014", "KOSMOS German Fifth edition", "KOSMOS German first edition", "KOSMOS German Fourth edition", "KOSMOS German Second edition with SdS", "Kosmos German small rectangle edition (2008)", "KOSMOS German Special edition", "KOSMOS German Third edition with SdS and SdJ", "Laser plus Slovenian Edition", "Mass Games Chinese edition", "MINDOK Czech edition", "Nexus Italian edition", "Piatnik Czech and Hungarian edition", "Polish second edition", "Portuguese/Spanish Edition", "Russian edition", "Sophisticated Games Hebrew edition", "Sophisticated Games UK Edition", "Tilsit French edition", "White Goblin Games Dutch edition 2014"], "average": "7.17415", "name": "Ingenious", "videogamebg": ["Ingenious"], "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Partnerships", "Pattern Building", "Tile Placement"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "12960", "boardgameaccessory": ["Ingenious: Score Tracker Overlay"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Ingenious", "Mensa Select", "Solitaire Games"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BGTG - May 2, 2005 (SR: Settlers, Dancing Dice, Basari, Ra, San Marco, Xe Queo!, Ingenious, Star Wars Ep. 2 Card Game, Kapitan Wackelpudding)", "Episode 009 - Ingenious", "Episode 23 - Unpub 6 and a Slew of New Hotness", "Episode 6: Ingenious", "Episode 84- The Others and Game Design Ideas", "Podcast #043 - Guia de compras y recomendaciones de juegos de mesa 2011 Parte 1", "The Game Pit: Episode 46 - Council Chamber: Big Episode on Small Games", "What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing Week 85!"]}, "9675": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1191603.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Martin Wallace"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2004", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Tanja Donner"], "boardgamepublisher": ["KOSMOS", "Mayfair Games"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1191603_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Transportation"], "description": "The route-building game genre can be counted as the greatest passion of English game designer and history teacher Martin Wallace. And with La Strada, he has come up with a particularly clever road-building game. Everything &ndash; from the rules to the game play &ndash; is devilishly simple. The game lets players claim successes throughout the game, and turn-by-turn one reaches one or even multiple goals. But at the end, someone else wins? How did that happen?<br/><br/>The game features a variable game board, built up out of hex tiles that depict easily traveled flatland, forests, or hills. Before the start of the game, nineteen different settlements (ranging from cities to tiny villages) with varying victory point values are randomly placed onto those spaces featuring a gray symbol. Each player then places his or her starting marker onto a chosen flatland tile. The object here is of course to try to put your starting marker near as many high-value cities as possible.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to connect together as many settlements with your roads as possible, in order to get as many victory points as possible. The catch is that settlements award fewer and fewer victory points the more players connect to them. The cities are like pies: the more people want a slice, the smaller the slices have to be.<br/><br/>Building streets is very simple. One a player&rsquo;s turn, he receives six gold pieces. Each street segment costs two gold to build over flatland, three over forest, and four over hills. Players can build as many segments as they can afford on their turn, provided that they end at a settlement and don&rsquo;t intersect any other streets on the way. Put simply: players can&rsquo;t end a street in the middle of nowhere and then keep building next turn. Streets have to reach their destination at the end of each turn.<br/><br/>Once a settlement has been reached, and then the player gets to put one of their trade markers on it. Note that streets can intersect each other only at the settlement locations. If a player doesn&rsquo;t use up all of his gold on his turn, then he can save it for the next turn (where he will also get another six gold to play with again). Players aren&rsquo;t allowed to spend more than ten gold pieces on their turn, though, so you can&rsquo;t save forever.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player can&rsquo;t build any more roads or doesn&rsquo;t have any trade markers left.<br/><br/>Scoring then occurs. A scoring example for a city: The city is worth five victory points, but only if it was connected to by a single player. A doubly connected city is worth four points for each player, while a triply connected city is only worth three each. Cities connected to by four players are only worth two points. This decreasing point system also counts for smaller settlements, worth between four and two victory points. A nicely thought out sorting system ensures that the end game scoring doesn&rsquo;t turn into a math exercise. Naturally, the player with the most victory points is the winner. In the case of a tie, then the tied player with the most gold left is the winner.<br/><br/>La Strada is a very simple game: build roads and connect cities. But it&rsquo;s not that easy to get ahead with the scores. It&rsquo;s every player&rsquo;s dream to claim a fat five point city all to themselves &ndash; but a player who spends too much energy trying to protect an investment will find that his other road-building options become tighter.<br/><br/>[Text is from a preview by Spielbox]<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition", "German edition"], "name": "La Strada", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Area Control / Area Influence", "Area Enclosure", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Route/Network Building", "Tile Placement"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "1255", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games", "Strategy Games"], "average": "6.19808", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["clp043 \u2013 cubelove podcast \u2013 Martin Wallace Short Review Smackdown", "La Strada"]}, "9676": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic40372.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1988", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "4", "boardgamepublisher": ["Milton Bradley"], "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic40372_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Children's Game"], "description": "The Silly Dillys are plastic slinkies with a head on one end and suction cup feet on the other.

The squares making up the orbits are numbered according to the atomic numbers of the elements from Hydrogen (1) to radon (86).<br/><br/>The number of counters a player has depends on the number of players.  Two players have eight counters each, three players have six counters each, and four players have four counters each.<br/><br/>Players take turns to roll both dice.  The scores obtained on the dice may be used as a total, or as individual dice scores, to move the player's pieces to their best advantage.  For each six thrown, the player may move one piece into play, and roll that dice again.  The player does not have to move a piece into play unless he or she has no pieces in play already.<br/><br/>The players move their pieces along the track until they complete a circuit and land directly on a jump square.  When a piece lands on a jump square it is elevated to the next highest quantum level.  When a piece moves up a level, the controlling player gets an extra roll of one dice.<br/><br/>If a player's piece lands on the same square as an opponent's piece, Blatting occurs.  The piece that is Blatted moves down one energy level whilst the piece doing the Blatting moves up a level.  If a player's piece passes an opponents piece, Zapping occurs.  The piece that is Zapped moves down one energy level, but the piece that Zapped it does not move up.  A piece that is Zapped can Blat any piece that it lands on.  Thus both Blatting and Zapping are subject to chain-reaction.<br/><br/>To win the game a Quantum Jump must be achieved.  This is done by having a piece positioned on the yellow flash square, situated in the fourth energy band, at the same time as there are exactly half the total available number of player-counters in play.<br/><br/>"}, "9678": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Glory", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1980", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic40370_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Morning Star Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic40370.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Religious"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Glory embodies a new, fresh experience in bible study and Christian living.

Most of the time, they have to pay money, which is usually gained from the &quot;Pay Day&quot; space.  Players can also buy businesses and earn income from other players who land on those spaces.  Loans can be taken if money is insufficient, but too many loans lead to bankruptcy, which will hurt a player's final score.<br/><br/>Blessings, used for scoring, are mostly gained by achieving accomplishments.  Most accomplishments (getting a diploma, attending church, etc) are gained by landing on the spaces required.  Some require players to have visited another space (e.g. to get married, one must land on &quot;BYU Square&quot;, pay $15,000, then proceed to the &quot;Temple Square&quot;).<br/><br/>When landing on a Spice of Life space, players draw a card and follow the instructions printed, which can be beneficial or detrimental.  Some cards offer choices: a player can either gain cash or Blessings, or possibly mull over which to sacrifice.<br/><br/>Blessings are scored for a player when he or she lands on the &quot;Interview Square&quot;.  The game ends when a player has three Interviews; the player with the highest total score (from three Interviews) is the winner.<br/><br/>The 1985 version by Ungame is simpler in design.  It has fewer spaces on the board and does not have events that require players to track to different spaces to gain Blessings.  The first player to obtain a Gospel card (obtained by landing on a square) and have at least 50 Blessings (the number can be adjusted on agreement) wins and ends the game.<br/><br/>"}, "9758": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic40622.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1986", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Market Force"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic40622_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Memory", "Trivia"], "description": "Be the first player to completely fill the state-shaped scoring map by correctly answering questions at five of the six key cities, and then answering a question correctly at Trenton.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "0", "name": "Uniquely New Jersey", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Memory"], "average": "2.66667", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: USA"]}, "9759": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Outta Control", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Betting/Wagering", "Memory", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1992", "usersrated": "25", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic399596_t.jpg", "average": "6.66", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Parker Brothers"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic399596.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English (UK) edition", "English Edition", "German edition 1992"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Memory", "Party Game", "Real-time"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Get rid of all your chips.

Each player represents a different temple, faithful to the divinities Achvizr, Alpan, Leinth, and Thalna.  On &quot;Tagete's&quot; day, the Etruscan Haruspexes [priests] proceed down the path of purification to the Velthumena Altar.<br/><br/>Goal:<br/><br/>Each player has 8 pawns representing &quot;Haruspexes&quot; [priests] in their color.  Each player is trying to move their priests along the path of purifiction from their home temple to the altar at the center of the board.  One player may also choose the path of darkness and consecrate themselves to the divinity &quot;Tuchulcha&quot; with the goal of elminating all rival priests.  This role is only available in 3 and 4 player games.  If a player chooses this path, then another single player may consecrate themselves to &quot;Lasa Vecuvia&quot; with a different set of powers.  This player's goal is to now move their priests to set &quot;passages&quot; on the path and place 4 seals to win the game.  This role is only available in 4 player games.<br/><br/>Players win by having the most priests in the center altar at game end.  If a player chooses Tuchulcha's power, they win by eliminating all other priests, and lose if any priest enters the altar.  A player that chooses the Lasa Vecuvia power wins only by placing all 4 seals.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>Game plays with 2, 3, or 4 players. Each player begins the game with 8 pawns on their home temple.  On their turn players roll 2 dice.  If doubles are rolled, the player may throw a third die.  Then player chooses to move one or more of their pawns the number of pips shown on each die.  For example, if a 5 and a 2 are rolled, a player may move one pawn 5 and another 2, or one pawn 5, and then 2 [not seven at once].  This is important as where you land can be significant on each move.  Players move their pawns around a spiral path approaching the altar at the center.  Along the way players will encounter other players' pawns, and special spaces on the path.  These spaces can increase the &quot;spiritual strength&quot; of players' pieces by two times of three times [Mystical Stones], or &quot;passage&quot; spaces can banish them to the Tuchulcha forest.  While Mystical Stone spaces are powerful in defense, pawns must move off these spaces as soon as they can.  Pawns can normally pass through each other regardless of owner.  Any number of a single player's pawns may occupy a single space.  However, when a pawn would land on another player's by exact count, it must equal the &quot;spiritual strength&quot; of the player's pieces in the space.  Normally, spiritual strenght is one per pawn, but in the 2x or 3x spaces these are multiplied respectively.  If a moving player can eqaul the spiritual strength of pawns in the space, then the occupying pawns are banished to the Tuchulcha forest.  These pawns are essentially out of the game, but can be used to activate the alternate &quot;Tuchulcha&quot; player role. Once a pawn banishes an opponent's pawn, it may not move again this turn.  2 player game uses 2 &quot;neutral&quot; colors which any player can move during their turn.  3 player game adds the optional Tuchulcha player role, and 4 player adds both Tuchulcha and Lasa Vecuvia roles to play.<br/><br/>At any time one and only one player [in 3 and 4 player games], may choose to take on the role of Tuchulcha [a god of destruction]. To activate this power, the player must &quot;sacrifice&quot; 3 pawns.  These pawns may come from the home temple, altar, path, or Tuchulcha forest.  Once activated, the Tuchulcha player's new objective is to eliminate all other players' pawns.  As soon as one other player's pawn enters the altar, Tuchulcha loses and is eliminated from the game.  This can make this role selection a risky move.  However, this player gains powerful new abilities. Tuchulcha's pawns can never be banished to the forest, he rolls 4 dice and selects the 3 best, and no longer has to stop after banishing an opponent's pawn.<br/><br/>If a player chooses to be Tuchulcha in a 4 player game, then another [and only one] player may take the role of Lasa Vecuvia.  This player must still have 4 active pawns in play to activate.  This player's objectives are now to &quot;seal&quot; the 4 passages along the path.  These passages normally banish pawns to the forest, but when the Lasa player lands a pawn on the passage, she places a seal token on the passage and removes the pawn from play.  Once she places all four seals in this manner she wins the game.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>32 high quality wooden pawns in 4 colors<br/>4 green wooden dice with gold pips and rounded corners<br/>1 double sided game board for 3 and 4 player games<br/>1 full color illustrated rules booklet<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["daVinci Games First Edition", "Mayfair edition"], "name": "Tuchulcha", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "147", "average": "5.1979", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The Spiel #63 - T For Two"]}, "9803": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic76895.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["John Best", "Dean Essig"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2002", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "12", "boardgamepublisher": ["Multi-Man Publishing"], "maxplaytime": "180", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic76895_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Fighting", "Wargame", "World War I"], "description": "Sub-titled: 'Ludendorff's Last Chance' &amp; Part of the Standard Combat Series #9, this game covers the March 21, 1918 offensive by the Germans in order to regain the initiative on the Western Front before the might of the U.S. forces will be felt.<br/><br/>The components consist of the following: a Full COLOR paper Mapsheet; 420-Full COLOR cardboard counters in 2 sheets; 10- Scenarios; a 'Series' RULES Book; a Scenario Book; and 2-DICE.

These are games that both teenage and older players can enjoy.

Each side has a number of counters representing infantry, artillery, cavalry, locomotives and headquarters, each with varying strength and movement capabilities.  The pieces are identified by number only (i.e., an infantry piece has a #4 on its face, and an artillery piece has a #2).  Movement is affected by terrain, as is battle strength.  The Union army wins the main game by retaining control of Chattanooga and capturing Atlanta.  The Confederates win by holding Atlanta.<br/><br/>The game is interesting in part because of its publication date.

(There are also sets made with 1-9 or 1-12.)<br/><br/>Initially all the levers are in the 'up' position.<br/><br/>The first player rolls two dice.  He or she then knocks down the levers as follows:<br/><br/>One number which is the combined value of both dice.<br/><br/>Or...<br/><br/>Two numbers whose total adds up to the combined total of each dice.<br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/>If a one and a five are rolled, the player may choose to knock down the lever covering the number six, or the levers covering numbers one AND five, or ANY other combination of numbers adding up to six.<br/><br/>The player continues to roll, knocking down levers each turn, until he or she cannot use the whole of the dice count because those numbers in the box have already been covered. (Note: If the 7,8 &amp; 9 are covered, some versions let you choose to roll one or two dice. Some use that rule if the total of the remaining numbers is less than six.)<br/><br/>The player's score is the total value of the numbers left uncovered (in some versions the score is instead read directly from the numbers left on the box -- if the 2, 4, &amp; 6 are left, then your score is 246).  All the levers are then raised again, and play passes to the next player.<br/><br/>There are several methods of scoring. In the traditional pub gambling game, you add up all the levers left uncovered. The games pays out after one round (one turn per player who paid into the pool). If you manage to &quot;shut the box&quot; you win instantly and get double the stake from each player.<br/><br/>In other scoring methods, you play multiple rounds, with players adding points to their previous score. As players reach forty-five (or other set number) they go 'bust' and must drop out of the game. The game then ends when only one player remains in the game.  He or she is the winner.<br/><br/>If any player knocks down ALL the levers in his or her turn, and thus 'shuts the box', they are automatically declared the winner!<br/><br/>This was later the inspiration for the NBC Daytime TV game show High Rollers airing from 1974 until 1975 and again from 1979 until 1980 under the name as (The New) High Rollers and much later in Syndication from 1975 until 1976 and from 1987 until 1988.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Are-Jay Edition", "Autruche Canadian English/French Edition", "Autruche Red Edition", "Bombay Company English edition", "Brio English Edition", "Brio Swedish Edition", "Cardinal Timeless Classic Edition", "CHH edition", "Crisloid Edition 1980", "Drueke You Can't Lose Edition", "Dutch wooden edition", "English British Edition", "English travel edition", "Front Porch Circa Edition", "Front Porch Classics Bookshelf Edition", "Front Porch Green Tin Edition", "Fundex English Edition", "German edition", "Gibsons Games Green Surround Edition", "Grow Portuguese travel edition", "HearthSong Edition", "Ideal Blue Edition", "Invicta British Edition", "Invicta Play It Again Edition", "John Jaques & Sons edition", "John Jaques mahogany edition", "John N.

Blank ship forms allow the player to list all the ranges and damages of his ship's particular guns in advance, making it quick and easy to calculate both damage and hit probability. Critical hits are a function of the amount of damage taken last round vs. the amount of damage able to be taken. Critical hits are typically scored against systems (engineering, bridge, steering or individual weapon mounts).<br/><br/>Each scenario has its own map, showing the disposition of forces.

You have a horse, $300 and the shirt on your back. Movement around the board is by roll of the dice. To become a rustler you must acquire your guns and gear. There is an outer trail in which you are a small-time rustler and you steal cows and horses and put your gang together. There are 32 real outlaws with biographies in this game. Critters stolen in one state need to be driven to another for sale.  They can be stolen from you on this journey. Once you have at least two gang members you can move to the inner trail where the banks and trains are. These are the same ones robbed by the Wild Bunch.  Interspersed throughout the board are &quot;Outlaw Fate&quot; squares.  When you land on these you take an Outlaw Fate card.  This is real history.  There are 192 of these cards and each card tells a story and the resulting board move.  They can either be good, bad or neutral to you. Once you have stolen a predetermined amount of money you can take the &quot;Final Trail&quot; to win the game.

No beauty contests to win here, so you'd better spend them wisely. You will get cards with collectible items, though. And a the item value increases the more items you have in the collection. So getting lots of cards in one collection is good, but naturally there is a risk - each collection can possibly be fake and worth nothing. This is controlled by the Insider Information cards which sometimes are available for auction in the game.<br/><br/>Another interesting aspect of the game is the trading part. If you put cards down on the table, they are always for sale, and if an opponent happens to land on Trade, he can buy a category from you (for the market value). However, you can never lose money on showing your cards, but your opponent may increase his collection and therefore earn more - unless they are fake, of course.<br/><br/>The final balancing aspect is that the cards that you don't show are not declared properly, so if you land on Tax Razzia, you have to pay for those cards.<br/><br/>There are also bank-controlled auctions.<br/><br/>Speculation is a very well balanced, exciting and different economic game and you don't know for sure who's the winner until it's all over.<br/><br/>The game is in Swedish and scales well from three to five players.

It was the last battle in Europe (maybe in the world) in which three monarchs commanded armies: the little Napoleon for the French, Victor Emmanuel for the Sardinians and Franz Joseph I for the Austrians.<br/><br/>The scale is 600 meters per hex, 1 hour per turn. Units are infantry and cavalry brigades and corps-level artillery batteries. Units are rated for attack strength, movement factor and cohesion, which represents both morale and the number of losses that the unit can take before dissolving (2 for most infantry and cavalry, 3 for a few, 1 for artillery). Stacking is limited to one unit of any type plus one additional artillery unit per hex. Facing is of no importance for movement but does affect combat: Units may attack only through their 3 front hexes and are penalized if attacked from the flank or rear.<br/><br/>Command and control are of great importance. Most units are attached to higher level formations (corps for the French and Austrians, divisions for the Italians). A unit is in command only if it is within range of its corps/division headquarters and the HQ either is within range of its monarch or passes an initiative test. Out-of-command units aren't helpless but are barred from entering hexes adjacent to enemy units' fronts. The royal and imperial personages, particularly Victor Emmanuel and Franz Joseph, are not very mobile, thus limiting forward movement in what is essentially a huge meeting engagement.<br/><br/>The movement sequence uses the &quot;chit pull&quot; mechanism. Activation chits for each formation (plus a chit for each side representing all of its unattached units) are placed into a cup and drawn to determine which corps's or division's units may move next. The player who wins the initiative (usually the French) has the slight advantage of being able to select the first formation that will move each turn, without having to draw.<br/><br/>Combat is somewhat unusual, employing a system that makes attacks hard and bloody. The attacker's strength is compared to the defense value of the terrain occupied by the defender (1 for clear hexes, 2 for woods, villages and upper slopes, 3 for towns); the defender's strength doesn't matter. At first glance, the combat results table looks very favorable. There are two catches: First, unless an HQ stacks with one of the attackers and passes an initiative test, attacks cannot be combined. The brigades go in one by one. Second, the defender gets to use its own strength for defensive fire against each successive attack before the attacker may fire. A not untypical result of an uncoordinated attack is that each attacker in turn suffers disorder and is forced to fall back without doing any damage. Coordinated attacks work much better - the defender must divide its strength among the attacking units, while they get to add theirs - but, as noted, require the presence of an HQ, which risks the loss of its commander in the process. (He will be replaced, but by a less effective subordinate.) Artillery can help by softening up the target, but there aren't a lot of batteries. (Most of the guns present are abstractly incorporated in the infantry brigade strengths.). Worse yet, they move slowly, have trouble obtaining good lines of sight and are easily eliminated if they get too near the enemy.<br/><br/>As the battle goes on, formations will become demoralized through the loss of more than half of their initial steps. Once demoralized, they can do little except retreat off the field.<br/><br/>Players gain a Victory Point for occupying each of 7 towns and one for every two enemy corps or divisions demoralized. A side can also win instantly by eliminating the enemy Emperor (Napoleon or Franz Joseph), though only a rather careless player will expose his monarch to attack.<br/><br/>The battle starts at dawn (5:00 am) and will usually end abruptly in the late afternoon when a thunderstorm sweeps the field. If the storm holds off, the last turn is 6:00 pm. Whether or not it arrives, oppressive heat almost certainly will, slowing units and lowering their morale.<br/><br/>This game was announced as the first of the series, and a later issue of Vae Victis had a pair of sequels, covering the battles of Magenta (1859, the other big battle of the same war) and Reichshoffen (1870, Franco-Prussian War). There were, however, no more, either because the difficulties of attack frustrated aggressive players or simply owing to a lack of widespread interest in mid-19th Century European wars.
