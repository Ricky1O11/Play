The Advanced Game rules are also standardized so players will be able to move quickly from one campaign to the other.<br/><br/>Atlanta Is Ours includes fourteen Basic Game scenarios and five Advanced Game campaigns, all extensively playtested:<br/><br/>Basic Game Scenarios<br/><br/><br/>    The Opportunity of a Lifetime (Snake Creek Gap/Resaca (5/9/1864, 1 turn, small forces): Beginner&rsquo;s scenario, great for learning how to play.<br/>    The Gap Is Blocked (5/8-5/10/1864, 3 turns): Hypothetical scenario, what could have happened if Sherman had not sent McPherson to Snake Creek Gap and instead attacked or tried to outflank other points in the Confederate defenses.<br/>    Battle of Resaca (5/14/1864; 1 turn): Sherman's entire army reinforces McPherson's corps outside Resaca, and attacks Johnston's army in Resaca, which has just arrived from its positions around Dalton.<br/>    From the Oostanaula to the Etowah (5/17-5/21/1864, 6 turns): Sweeping maneuver from one river to the other, with the aborted battle of Cassville near the end of the scenario. Includes special random events and optional limited intelligence.<br/>    Advance and Retreat (5/19-5/22/1864; 4 turns): Johnston's army attempts to attack a portion of Sherman's army while Sherman is advancing on a wide front. Hood aborts the attack as it is developing and falls back into a defensive line near Cassville.<br/>    The Hell Hole (5/25-5/28/1864; 4 turns): Sherman moves off the rail line to the west in an attempt to flank Johnston, but is stopped after several days of battle. This scenario encompasses the battles of Dallas, New Hope Church, and Pickett's Mill.<br/>    Kennesaw Mountain (6-22-6/27; 6 turns): This scenario covers the battles of Kolb&rsquo;s Farm and Kennesaw Mountain.<br/>    Crossing the Chattahoochee (7/3-7/8/1864; 6 turns): Johnston retreats from Kennesaw Mountain and then Sherman breaches Johnston's line covering the bridges and fords of the Chattahoochee River.<br/>    Battle of Atlanta (7/20-7/221864; 3 turns): Hood (now in command of the CSA army) attacks portions of Sherman's army twice, at Peachtree Creek and Bald Hill, but is beaten back with heavy losses both times.<br/>    Ezra Church (7/28/1864; 1 turn; half armies): Hood sends two corps to block Howard (now commanding the Army of the Tennessee), who is attempting to move around Atlanta from the west; they stop Howard, but incur heavy casualties in their attacks.<br/>    Wheeler's Raid (8/10-8/15; 6 turns; solitaire cavalry scenario): Wheeler moves north to disrupt the Union supply line around Dalton; -Wheeler does minimal damage before being forced to retreat.<br/>    Kilpatrick's Raid (8/18-8/22/1864; 5 turns, cavalry scenario): Kilpatrick takes the Union cavalry south around Atlanta to Lovejoy's Station, but he does minimal damage and returns to Union lines.<br/>    Marching On Tara (8/28 - 9/2/1864; 6 turns): Sherman moves around the west flank of the Confederates and marches to the RR stations supplying Atlanta from the west and the south. The goal is to force the Confederates to fight outside the forts or abandon Atlanta. Tara is the fictional plantation in the movie Gone With The Wind, and is &quot;located&quot; a few miles from Jonesboro where the armies have their final battle.<br/>    Last Stand At Tara (8/31 - 9/2/1864; 3 turns): This scenario encompasses both the Confederate attack on the Union at Jonesboro and then the Confederate retreat and consolidation of their army at Lovejoy&rsquo;s Station to the south on the RR line.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Advanced Game Scenarios<br/><br/><br/>    To The Chattahoochee (Advanced scenario, May-July 1864): This scenario covers Johnston's retreat and the Union advance from the initial lines at Dalton to near Atlanta.<br/>    The Real Game For Atlanta (Advanced scenario, July-Sept. 1864): This scenario encompasses Hood's attacks near the Atlanta forts and Sherman's maneuvering resulting in the Union capture of Atlanta.<br/>    The Atlanta Campaign (Advanced scenario, May-Sept 1864): A &quot;grand campaign&quot; linking the two above advanced scenarios.<br/>    The Hardest Knocks (Advanced scenario, May-July or Sept 1864): Alternative setups to the May campaign startup.<br/>    Without Home Or Habitation (Advanced scenario, Sept &ndash; Oct 1864): After the fall of Atlanta, Hood heads north to cut Sherman&rsquo;s rail line.

These unique factors lead to one-of-a-kind, creative discussions.  Only one G.M.O.ooh! Card survives per round.  The player with the last remaining G.M.O.ooh!

Each Category has a Description and a Rating number.  The Categories are Profit, Cost, Environmental Impact, Demand, and Risk.<br/><br/>Each Challenge Card allows a player to Challenge and overtake the Current Leader.  Red Challenge Cards involve adding or subtracting Rating points or changing the Category.

It can best be described as a combination of Scrabble and Scattergories, but unlike Scrabble, you don&rsquo;t need a crazy vocabulary to win, unlike Scattergories there&rsquo;s no ambiguity, and unlike most word games, the &ldquo;smartest&rdquo; player doesn&rsquo;t always win.<br/><br/>A &quot;snippet&quot; is a short sequence of letters that can be found as a whole within one or more words. For example, the snippet IPP can be found in the words SNIPPETS, QUIPPED, and HIPPIE but not in SHIPSHAPE, PIPE, or HOPPING.<br/><br/>Players have 60 seconds to write down as many words as they can think of that contain each round's snippet. Anything goes! Dictionary words, people names, place names, brand names, fictional things, technical terms, slang, acronyms, abbreviations, contractions, hyphenations, non-english words, the snippet itself, and even plurals and alternate verb tenses are all allowed!<br/><br/>When time's up, players compare answers, earning points for unique words and fun bonuses. The player with the most points wins the round and the first to 3 rounds wins the game!<br/><br/>With its unique &quot;anything goes&quot; rule, Snippets isn't like most word games, requiring more of a creative mind than a large vocabulary.

Any remaining stories from the Human homeworld now have the status of legends and are therefore assumed by most to be exaggerated. The Consortium stretches across three star systems, with twelve inhabited planets. Several wars have coloured the history of the Consortium, notably the Bug War between the Humans and Ximians; the events surrounding a raider named Shaun Hardcastle; and the conflict with the Resistance, which still continues. While the situation cannot be described as stable (as there are those who believe the Consortium is on the brink of civil war) people do not live in fear of their lives on a day to day basis.<br/><br/>Over the centuries, Humanity has made contact with three species of alien: the graceful and technologically advanced Eulutians, the strong and community-driven Ximians and the tough and spiritual Vilithii. By 446CE, Humans and all aliens have been given equal rights. However, they are not equally represented within the power structure of &ldquo;The Consortium&rdquo;, which is the term used to describe known inhabited space, much as &ldquo;Earth&rdquo; was used in antiquity.<br/><br/>The alien influences on development have led to advances in technology beyond levels thought possible by those humans who founded the Consortium. Gravitational control, intersystem travel through artificially relocated wormholes and food which can be grown on the outside of starships are all commonplace in the Consortium. Colonisation of planets without atmosphere, or with atmospheres which are poisonous or corrosive, is possible by using constructions known as &ldquo;biodomes&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The Consortium has also discovered and colonised two planets with atmospheres similar to Earth. Commercial travel from one colony to another within a star system takes up to two weeks in a standard ship, although military ships travel faster.<br/><br/>Interstellar travel takes longer than this, as in-system travel is required before using the wormholes. If and when the majority of the population travel between the planets, they use passenger transports, which run from one planet to another frequently and those wealthy enough own their own interplanetary transport. On-planet, there is both public and private transport. Vehicles called &ldquo;Hoppers&rdquo; are common, carrying sentient beings and goods from one place to another within the gravity well of a planet and can function whether an atmosphere is present or not.<br/><br/>The power structure of the Consortium is well-defined. It is ruled by a body known as the &ldquo;Big Seven&rdquo; (comprising seven Humans). These are the CEOs of the seven largest existing Companies, which dominate the Consortium. The remaining Companies range in size from huge multi-planetary organisations to groups which contain only a few individuals. This ruling body, although originally intended to operate in the interests of all citizens, has degenerated to such an extent that each member now works only for the interests of their own Company. Despite these rivalries, internal alliances which have endured for centuries still exist within the Big Seven. However, for the first time, several of the Big Seven are beginning to act directly against each other in their struggle for increased power. Representatives, both official and unofficial, of each of the Big Seven Companies are present on every world. Their roles range from conducting official business to quietly eliminating perceived threats to their own Company.<br/><br/>There is another political body called the &ldquo;Senate&rdquo;. The top 200 Companies, ranked in terms of profit, each send one representative to the Senate. The Senate was established at the time the Consortium was founded but, by 446CE, the general population believe it has lost its power. Officially, the Senate is obliged to ratify all laws passed by the Big Seven, and so far they have not failed to do this for over 100 years. However, the chief importance of the Senate is that it is the only body to hold, and be able to order the use of, all weapons of mass destruction. The Senate is not proportionally representative of the races found in the Consortium; although there are at least a few representatives from each alien race, the majority are human.<br/><br/>The Big Seven rules over the whole population of the Consortium. As long as the citizens follow the laws, commands they are given and meet the expectations imposed on them, they will live a good life, being given the advantage of all available technology if they so wish. If they fail to meet these expectations, they can expect to be imprisoned or worse.<br/><br/>Despite the majority of the population having a good life, a Resistance movement has come into being. The members of this movement believe that most of the Big Seven are actively plotting the genocide of the aliens and have no care for how many Humans may be killed in the process.<br/><br/>They are convinced the Big Seven are attempting an atrocity by means of a secret plot &ndash; they plan to use a weapon attached to a massive starship, the Orion, to kill all life in the most remote Star System. By blaming it on a solar event and using the panic that ensues to lock down travel, they plan to corner the Resistance and eliminate alien threats to their supremacy for ever.<br/><br/>A small number of brave Resistance operatives, like those from other resistance movements through the ages, are have managed to board the Orion, and even now, the best of them make their way to the ship&rsquo;s weapon core...<br/><br/>Era: The Consortium is a Hard Sci-Fi Tabletop RPG and this Quickstart Guide lets you have a go right away!

Talon is a tactical game of space fleet combat between the Terran Confederation and the invading Talon Empire.  It is a quick playing game with simple, but not simplistic rules that innovatively allows you to play large space fleet battles quickly.  By keeping all of the information in front of you on the board, it enables you to have lots of choices and interesting decisions without the brain burn.<br/><br/>Why is it named Talon 1000?<br/><br/>The expansion is called Talon 1000 because it adds over 1000 scenarios to the game of Talon.  With 4 sheets of expansion counters, most of which have ships printed on both sides, the game comes with ~130 new ships.  For comparison, the base game came with a total of 54 ships.  Some of the new counters are increased numbers of the current ship types, but many of them are additional ship designs with different weapon load outs and configurations.  This gives a wide array of point values which makes scenario balancing easy.<br/><br/>The 1000 scenarios come from the tables of fleets that are built from all these new counters.  Both the Talon and the Terran have 10 unique fleets at the 300 point level, the 400 point level, the 500 point level, etc.  All the fleets on each table are within 1 point of the table's total with no special rules or counter changes required.  There are 10 of these table of increasing points.  To play a random scenario, the players can either choose a point level or roll a 10 sided die to arrive at one.  Then they each randomly roll a die on that table to determine their fleet.  With 100 different scenarios possible from each table, the 10 tables give the players 1000 unique scenarios.<br/><br/>The over 1000 scenarios part comes from all the additional things included in the expansion - base assaults, terrain, etc.<br/><br/>"}, "209637": {"rpgdesigner": ["Keith J.

Each hexagon on both maps represents 20 miles (32.5 km) from side to opposite side. The system is based around the central idea that large First World armies (as well as those from elsewhere that have been trained and equipped to try to perform like First World armies) almost always begin major wars seemingly well prepared. Unfortunately for those in their front-line units, both the training and equipment usually only make them ready for the previous war, not the one they're about to fight. Beyond that, the initial period of such wars is characterized by only a partially abandoned peacetime psychology among the officers and enlisted. That is, no one as yet appreciates what it means operatively to be in an all-out war. All that comes together to give overall performance high-risk, volatile and fragile qualities: no one as yet really knows what's actually possible or wise to try to accomplish. Seemingly powerful units therefore easily become &quot;disrupted&quot;--especially as gauged in relation to similar units' performances later, after everyone's been thoroughly schooled in the art of war as it exists in the present. The system therefore doesn't play--when looked at on a step by step basis--in a way common to division-level simulations. The whole thing has a &quot;Go&quot; like quality to it. The commander will succeed best who--rather than reacting to or launching operations opportunistically one at a time--plans his campaign and then campaigns on that plan. Of course, we all know it's also true &quot;no plan survives first contact with the enemy.&quot; So, even as you plan, you must do so while leaving within your overall scheme at least some capacity for opportunism. Strategy is not simple; it is complex.<br/><br/>The initiating change to history behind this game is as follows. Early in the spring of 1943, one of the historically failed assassination plots attempted against Hitler during that period actually succeeded. In short, that allowed the German high command to go over to a fully rationalized defense at the strategic, operational and tactical levels. Long story short: the Third Reich survived WW2 in truncated form (see the maps). The new rulers in Berlin soon thereafter set in place their own &quot;Warsaw Pact,&quot; an alliance among Germany, the Baltic republics, Belarus, Ukraine, and the Balkan countries north of Greece. The Allies reacted by creating NATO, which rump-Russia eagerly joined. By 1980, the same kind of rot that afflicted the USSR in our timeline began to set in within the Third Reich. Here, though, instead of initiating a German version of Perestroika and Glasnost, those ruling in Berlin decided to roll the dice on one all-out and final war for global domination. This game presents that war (or at least the two main theaters within it).<br/><br/>The components to a complete boxed game of NNN2 include rules, two map-sheets, and three sheets of die-cut counters (also called &quot;units&quot; and &quot;unit counters&quot;).

These heroes forged unbreakable alliances in search of knowledge, treasure, and glory. Rival adventuring parties would often descend into the same dungeon, and these companies fought one another as fiercely as they battled the monsters that lurked behind every dark corner. These were daring times, when nothing in the world was considered more sacred than the oath that bound those who shared the dangers of the pit together. This was the age of the Dungeon Alliance.<br/><br/>Dungeon Alliance is a deck-building, dungeon-crawling miniatures adventure game that allows players to send 1-4 different teams of adventurers into perilous dungeons in search of experience and treasure. At the start of the game, each player drafts their own team of four heroes (from the 17 included in the game) and uses tactical movement and card play to overcome the dungeon's monsters and treasures. Each player starts with a unique twelve-card starting deck that includes the starting cards from all four of their heroes.<br/><br/>Rival teams may compete with one another to slay monsters, or even battle one another for complete domination. As each team of heroes overcomes monsters and challenges, they earn experience point (XP) tokens that they can spend to purchase new cards for their alliance decks. Once spent, XP tokens are flipped face down and kept until the end of the game. When the sun greets those who emerge from the pit, the alliance that has accrued the most XP claims the mantle of victory.<br/><br/>Dungeon Alliance includes rules for competitive, cooperative, and solo play.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "8.4", "name": "Dungeon Alliance", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Card Drafting", "Deck / Pool Building", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Modular Board"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["1P 119 - The Manhattan Project: Energy Empire", "SC 002 Interview: Dungeon Alliance with Andrew Parks", "Table for One Bonus Episode - Dungeon Alliance with Andrew Parks", "The Dice Men Cometh \u2013 Episode 152", "WTG6 - Board Game Leftovers Podcast : Arkham Horror LCG and Legends of the American Frontier"]}, "209661": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3202289.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Andrew Birkett"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2017", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Sebastian Koziner", "Allan Ohr"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Atheris Games"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3202289_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Humor"], "description": "Supernatural Socks is a game about losing socks in the dryer.

You end up getting in front of a loan shark who is also a crime boss, asking him for a million dollars. He places 3 briefcases in front of you and asks you to &quot;pick one and open it&quot;. He further mentions that &quot;only one of them has the million dollars in cash, one has the trash and one has the bomb. If you end up opening the case with the cash, you walk away rich, if you open the case with the trash, you walk away with nothing but the stink and if you open up the case with the bomb then you are a roasted meat&quot;. You take a good look at all the 3 briefcases, put in front of you to choose from. They all look exactly same, they all weigh exactly same, they also feel exactly same, but the only thing in which they differ is, what they carry inside. All the briefcases are completely odorless and produce no sound upon shaking them. They are completely sealed and locked. You may only choose one briefcase and you only get to know what is inside it, by opening it right there and right then. You finally choose and grab one briefcase to open it while wondering, what is inside it ...<br/><br/>GAME PLAY :<br/><br/>What is inside it is an exhilarating and an exciting game. A number of players can play it against each other. This game of odds, chances and strategy unfolds when a number of players are confronted with a number of cards with briefcases pictures on it. To open a briefcase, the playing card is flipped upside down so that the content of that briefcase is revealed. Without knowing what is inside of each card, the players pick up and flip one card at a time, upon their turn in each round. The risk element kicks in when all the players must instinctively choose and flip a number of cards, which are to be opened one at a time upon their turns, and the content of the card is revealed. As each card is flipped or turned, the likelihood of the players having a valuable cash amount such as a million dollars in the card or something else, such as a BOMB. The pressure mounts in each round, as the number of cards are turned or flipped. The players may also come under pressure by what might be contained in their chosen card. What is inside it ? cash or bomb or something else... The players will always be curious and puzzled, but they also know that as long as they do not intentionally or accidentally open the card with a BOMB or come under attack by any other opponent player, they are fine.

Raicer, The Fall of the Third Reich covers the dramatic last two years of WWII in Europe, as the Western Allies and the Soviet Union fight against fierce German resistance to bring down the Thousand-Year Reich.<br/><br/>The time is July, 1943. From the beaches of Sicily to the plains of central Russia, millions of men are poised to decide the fate of Europe and bring about the end of WWII...<br/><br/>Two large hex maps cover Europe from France to Central Russia, and Leningrad to Sicily. Units are Armies, Corps, and in a few cases, Divisions. There are twelve two-month turns.<br/><br/>Those turns play quickly, and yet there is a lot of subtlety within each one, with rules for both reaction and exploitation. Getting the most out of the various movement segments is essential for both players: as the Axis for plugging gaps in the front line, and as the Allies for exploiting every last opportunity to move ever further into the Third Reich proper. But the German player will quickly learn that a passive defense is doomed to fail, and that selective counterattacks are vital to hold the enemy at bay.<br/><br/>The game includes rules for Soviet and German Command (Stavka), while the effects of Hitler's increasing interference in military affairs is presented through a rule which requires the German player to use OKW (West Front Headquarters) or OKH (East Front HQ) to be able to retreat infantry units from an enemy ZOC.<br/><br/>While the Soviets and Germans begin the game locked in a death struggle at Kursk, the Allies face the early dilemma of where to invade, with a choice of invasion sites ranging from Holland to Greece. Knock Italy out of the war or Second Front Now! in Northwest Europe: the choices are yours.<br/><br/>Supply rules have been kept as simple as possible, while still modeling the historic importance of logistics. The Western Allies in particular will learn the importance of ports in supplying their armies, and have to base their strategy around them.<br/><br/>Perhaps most significantly, the game effectively models the Strategic Air War over Europe with only a few simple rules and a handful of counters. But though easy to learn, this &lsquo;game within a game&rsquo; can have a dramatic impact upon the course of the war, as the Allies must prioritize their air resources while the Luftwaffe struggles both to slow the Allied air offensive and support the German armies in the field. The challenges are numerous and subtle.<br/><br/>Other rules cover variable (and degrading) German troop strength,  Allied Airborne drops, Strategic Transit, Forts, Yugoslav Partisans, and Axis Minor Powers, including Italian Surrender<br/><br/>The game can be played by two (Axis and Allied/Soviet) or three players (Axis, Allied and Soviet) but also works well solo. The Fall of the Third Reich is a game of large scope and nail-biting decisions, combining fidelity to history with a fun playable game system.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>Product Information<br/>Complexity: 5 out of 10<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 8 out of 10<br/>Time Scale: 1 turn = 2 months<br/>Map Scale: 1 hex = 30 miles<br/>Unit Scale: Armies, Corps and some Divisions<br/>Players: Best with 2 players but can be played well with 3 players or solitaire<br/>Playing Time: 6-10 hours<br/><br/>"}, "209864": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Alberto Avila Pe\u00f1a"], "poll": [], "name": "Enlace", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Route/Network Building", "Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "0", "boardgameimplementation": ["Rivers, Roads & Rails"], "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3217548_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3217548.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Party Game", "Puzzle"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "ENLACE is a competitive, tile-placement abstract game which emphasizes its educational aspects, mainly, the stimulation of the observation &amp; association skills in players.<br/><br/>Contents<br/><br/>140 printed tiles<br/><br/>Setup<br/><br/>All 140 tiles are shuffled, put face down and divided between 3 stacks of tiles of any given size.

Cards show one of five different colors/symbols, each corresponding to one path; in addition, each card shows a number (0-10, twice each). In each color, each player can play his cards in either ascending or descending order. As in Lost Cities, it's better to concentrate on a few paths since the final spaces on a path grant high points, but ending early gives negative ones.<br/><br/>The active player plays one card (out of a hand of eight) or discards one, then moves the corresponding playing piece on the path. Many of the spaces have a token that grants some bonus: either immediate points (counted on the scoring track), an extra move on a path, or wishing stones that are needed at game end to avoid negative points.<br/><br/>The game ends when five playing pieces (from any combination of players) have reached the seventh (or higher) space on their respective paths. Now, scoring happens: <br/><br/>     Pieces that moved only 1-3 steps earn negative points (-4, -3, -2).<br/>     Pieces with 4+ steps earn points (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10). <br/>     One piece of each player twice the height of other pieces scores double, either positive or negative. <br/>     Holding fewer than two wish stones earns negative points (-3 / -4), while a collection of five or more stones yields a bonus of 10 points.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>All endgame points are added to any scored during the game. The player with the highest score wins!<br/><br/>Included expansion: This new board provides new challenges and requires new ways of thinking. The new gameboard is arranged portrait-style rather than the landscape orientation of the original, and the five roads have been replaced by a network of intersecting and overlapping roads, so you can continue on a different color or even choose which way to go. The point values also change during your way, not simply increasing.<br/>Also you have 5 cairns on the board, with each cairn having a stack of five stones in a particular color. When you reach a spot on that track, you claim the top stone. Stones of all five colors are awarded 10 points; collecting three stones of the same color is also worth 10 points, too.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch edition", "German edition"], "average": "7.225", "name": "Keltis (with Neue Wege, Neue Ziele)", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Point to Point Movement", "Set Collection"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "20", "boardgamefamily": ["Lost Cities"]}, "209873": {"poll": [], "name": "Goo Saga", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android edition", "iOS edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Science / Technology"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Toka Loka Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone", "Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Toka Loka Games"], "description": "Goo Saga is a platform adventure game that takes place in a hidden underwater lab, where a reclusive genius scientist seeks to create life for his own enigmatic reasons.

The stock market in No Caboose! includes the effects of supply and demand due to stock trading, it embodies the effects of the nation's changing economic climate.

Players may choose a strategy of holding a diversified portfolio with stock in many railroads, or put all their money into one or two railroads.<br/><br/>Another difference in No Caboose! is that players are not railroad presidents and are not bogged down in the detail running a particular railroad.  Instead, players are financiers who arrange the routes railroads build and arrange the merger of small local lines into the bigger railroads.  That is, players are in the role of banker J.P. Morgan, not the role of president Jim Hill.  Players can help any railroad build a new line, which earns the player stock and money for arranging the new route.<br/><br/>A player's goal is simple.

The Reader shuffles the Reader deck and the Players mix, split evenly the Player deck between the teams and place them face-up in 3-4 rows in front of them. The Reader will read the complete poetry quotation on their cards and the player that finds the matching card first takes that card and puts it aside.

The first team that has no cards left on their side is the winner (you must get rid of all your cards first, to win).<br/><br/>The game is set in Japan during the Genpei war (1180-1185).

If you know what cards your opponent is familiar with, place those cards as far as possible from them inside the playing field.

Players have the goal of minimizing clone attacks and maximizing human survival rates.  The game has major puzzle and memory mechanics that forces players to rely on one another for both game play decisions and remembering details. Iris takes the tension, collaboration, and challenge of larger cooperative games and puts them into an elegant 20 minute micro game.<br/><br/>In Iris players attempt to organize 16 clone cards in a manner that does not cause the clones to attack human populations. The game has simple rules that are easy to learn yet make for a complex and difficult game.  There are three types of clone cards and each type of clone card has a common front. Each clone has a letter on the back of the card that stays hidden until the clones &quot;Data&quot; is scanned.  When a clone is scanned this letter is revealed to all players.  Players try to organize these clone cards in a way so that at the end of the game the letters on the backs of the cards cannot spell the words &quot;BOMB&quot;, &quot;MOB, or &quot;AMMO&quot;.  Because the only letters on the backs of the clone cards are A, B, M, and O this can be very challenging.  Players come across the clone data slowly so there will always be information unknown to players.  Players will weigh the odds of playing one clone over another (letter distributions are published on each card) while also risking gaining less knowledge about clones in order to take special actions like moving clones, moving human populations, or learning about un-played clones.  The whole game leads up a big reveal.  When all 16 clone cards are in their final locations they are all turned over and players see if any attacks occur.  When attacks occur, human populations are lost.  When all attacks have been accounted for players compare their remaining human population to their survival goal set at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "14", "name": "Iris: A Cooperative Micro Game", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Hand Management", "Memory"], "average": "6.825", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "209978": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Reader Contribution)", "Robert Barton", "Bradley Bemis", "Bil Boozer", "Timothy S.
