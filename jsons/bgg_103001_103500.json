Roberts Best Magazine Game Winner"], "description": "BEYOND WATERLOO is a two-player strategic level simulation of the Napoleonic Campaign of 1815. Players take the sides of France or its opponents, a coalition of Allies. In its long form the game opens with Napoleon&rsquo;s arrival at Paris following his return from Elba. It encompasses his efforts to restore France to a war footing, the Allies&rsquo; struggle to revive their anti-French coalition, and the military operations that ensue. BEYOND WATERLOO is played on a mapboard that includes France plus relevant portions of the Low Countries, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. Where most games on this period focus in on the famous Battle of Waterloo, BEYOND WATERLOO takes in the full scope of the politico-military possibilities inherent in the 1815 situation. The Allies must re-defeat Napoleon. The French must avoid that outcome.<br/><br/>BEYOND WATERLOO is a full strategic simulation encompassing military, economic, and diplomatic developments. It also introduces new design concepts for a game of this nature. Because of the complexities involved, these rules adopt a layered approach. Initially, the Combat Game introduces only the Battle Development Sequence, which affords a way to conduct combat in a strategic game that is nuanced for the Napoleonic era. This level of rules enables the player to learn the combat system using a scenario that covers only the Battle of Waterloo itself. At the next level, the Basic Game, rules introduce the full movement and administrative systems for a Napoleonic campaign. The scenario replicates the military action, economic factors, and force mobilization in this last Napoleonic War. The Advanced Game adds diplomacy, strategy and political action, and emphasizes the mobilization for war. In this long-form the game begins with Napoleon&rsquo;s return to Paris and the sides must prepare for war before conducting it.<br/><br/>BEYOND WATERLOO is played on a mapboard subdivided into areas that regulate the movement of game forces. Pieces represent prominent Commanders on all sides, and armies, corps, and divisions. Players organize and move their pieces across the mapboard to further their strategy. The players accumulate Resource Points (RPs) and Victory Points (VPs) as the game progresses. RPs procure fresh forces. The VPs influence events in the Campaign of 1815 as well as determining the winner of the game. In the Advanced Game players also engage in diplomatic and political activity intended either to prepare for war or shape the conditions that will affect the campaign.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Against the Odds First edition"], "name": "Beyond Waterloo", "playingtime": "960", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement"], "age": "0", "usersrated": "32", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "average": "7.21875"}, "103040": {"rpgartist": ["Aaron Acevedo", "John D.

Many horror tropes are timeless &ndash; blood speckled claws in the dark is pretty much always going to be scary &ndash; but many other horror elements are merely puzzling, and are going to be downplayed.

The area closest to shore is the easiest to fish in, but it's where all the smaller fish dwell. The middle body of the lake has some bigger fish but requires a pier license to reach. The third is the deepest and most costly in which to fish, but it's where the big daddies live, including one monster catfish that has never been caught and has fueled tall tales for years at the lake. Mixed into the tiles in each of the sections are also various bits of detritus such as old boots, lost bikinis and such that always seem to latch onto hooks during any fishing trip. They'll hurt your score at the end of the tournament, but some may very well be of use to someone if they, or an opponent, have a matching item...<br/><br/>Then there's the market, where fish can be sold for money to buy bigger equipment, or held until the end of the current day (round). The market prices fluctuate from day to day and there's a catch of the day that brings a bonus, so players will have to decide whether that fish is best kept for score or sold for cash.<br/><br/>The final station for each turn is the lodge where teams can hire a guide - an extra hand that will help them fish for the day. The guides get cheaper as the tournament draws to an end, so players will need to decide whether they pay a premium for that extra help in the beginning or save their money for one last push at the end. Teams can also check the weather for the next day while at the lodge, giving them a little insight at the weather patterns that could influence fish migration.<br/><br/>The next turns continue until the end of the day when there is a weigh in, which scores points for players. The player who has the most points at the end of three days wins!<br/><br/>Teams can also freely trade among themselves. This trading keeps the game lively and social, as players tempt each other to &quot;take the bait.&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "5", "name": "Take the Bait", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Chit-Pull System", "Storytelling", "Trading", "Variable Phase Order", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Sports: Fishing / Angling"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The One About Farming", "The One About Origins, Chemistry and The Big Blue Noodle", "The One About the Duke of Dice"]}, "103079": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1332124.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Cherilyn Joy Lee Kirkman", "Christopher Kirkman"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Jonathan Liu"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Greater Than Games (Dice Hate Me Games)"], "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1332124_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Children's Game", "Memory", "Racing", "Real-time"], "description": "The heat is on!

Placing a card in the third stage stack forces the player to swap the position of that stack with the first or second stack.<br/><br/>The race is timed - three minutes for each heat.

Trappers set traps and score points by catching &amp; selling furs. As they accumulate wealth, trappers can buy and build cabins on the board to set trap-lines to make even more money. Trappers can also tamper with each others traps and even steal them. However, if the Game Warden (only one allowed per game) catches them they can end up in jail. The Game Warden is also a trapper, so he can cash in on any poached game he seizes, as well as set traps himself. (However, as a lawman the Game Warden can't tamper with other player's traps.) The Anti-Trapper (only one allowed per game) scores by stealing traps from the Trappers and generally making life miserable for them.<br/><br/>Players navigate the unusual snowshoe-shaped board by rolling 2 six-sided dice and traveling along the showshoe's webbing. Different spots on the board allow players to set up traps for various game animals. (These spots are always on the edges of diamond or hexagonal areas that frame the illustration of the animal to be trapped.) Some animal hides are virtually worthless (like the lowly Skunk) while others pay top dollar (like the mighty Grizzly Bear). Only one trap may be set per square. A player must return to the square by landing on it with an exact die roll to successfully make a catch. Unfortunately, other players that land on the square may &quot;steal&quot; a catch from the trap. However, the offending player may be sent to jail for poaching if the Game Warden lands on the spot while they're still there.<br/><br/>Initially trappers are restricted to the first level of the board, but when they successfully trap an animal, they may progress another level down the board, repeating the process as they bag bigger and better game. Cards from the Fur In deck (collected when traps catch animals) make movement, and therefore scoring, more predictable. Cards from the Fur Out deck (collected when larger traps catch bigger animals) allow players to slowly collect letters to spell out the names of the animals with the biggest ticket furs... and to eventually make top dollar. A deck of event cards, name Yellowhead Cards (after the nickname of a famous Iroquois trapper/trader named Pierre Bostonais) can significantly alter a player's turn. This deck is activated by landing on particular spaces spread around the board. (Interestingly, the Anti-Trapper player is instructed to interpret the Yellowhead Cards to the best of his ability from his perspective. Some Yellowhead Cards simply won't apply to the Anti-Trapper.)<br/><br/>Players are allowed to trade or sell any in-game items to each other. This even applies to things like players combining Fur Out cards so that they can divide up a big score.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, players can buy Cabins to effectively take over certain game spaces for themselves. However this becomes an attractive target for the Anti-Trapper who'll want to burn the cabin down (as long as he can stay out of reach of the Game Warden).<br/><br/>The game may be played to a time limit (Trapping Season) or to any other method of conclusion that they players can agree on. The winner is the player with highest cash value of combined resources (traps, cabins, and, of course, furs) when the game ends.<br/><br/>The game includes the following components:<br/>- 1 Showshoe Playing Board<br/>- 7 Colored Playing Tokens<br/>- 6 Colored Sets of 50 Traps each<br/>- 10 Wooden Trappers Cabins<br/>- 1 Pair of Dice<br/>- 3 Different Sets of Cards (Fur In, Fur Out, &amp; Yellowhead)<br/>- 1 Pad of FUR Out Scoresheets<br/>- 1 FUR OUT Rules Booklet<br/>- 1 FUR OUT Player Aid Sheet<br/><br/>"}, "103087": {"poll": [], "name": "Star Voyager", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Famicom edition", "North American NES edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2652560.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction", "Space"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["ASCII Corporation"], "videogamegenre": ["Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["NES"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Acclaim Entertainment Inc."], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2652560_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>The player is a pilot attempting to escort a ship of refugees through space.

Various other characters appear on the main street in front of the Sheriff.<br/><br/>The actual gameplay mostly concerns the Sheriff discussing with the various characters via a selection menu similar to those in contemporary graphical adventures. For each line the other character says, the game offers a selection of four different responses, and the discussion progresses depending on the chosen response.

Depending on the answers you would give, characters would help you with useful tips end info, often resulting in &quot;who you meet next&quot;. Or they could just walk away, happy, neutral, bored or angry. Or in worst case they would suddenly draw a gun in which case you would have to draw your gun in self defense and shoot your opponent before they killed you. For some characters (like loose bandits) a peaceful result was hard to achieve. It was possible to just gun down characters, but that would have disastrous effects on your score.

In reality, the Matt Hazard character is in his first video game, with a history made up by D3 Publisher to chronicle the character's rise and fall in popularity. The Return of Matt Hazard marks Hazard's fictitious &quot;comeback&quot; to the gaming scene. Hazard is voiced by Will Arnett, while Neil Patrick Harris voices his nemesis Wallace &quot;Wally&quot; Wellesley.<br/><br/>The game itself is a parody of action-gaming clich&eacute;s. The October 2008 debut trailer was done as a Behind the Music spoof called Inside the Game complete with Jim Forbes narration. It chronicles Matt Hazard's successes and hardships, and mirrors the progression of the Duke Nukem series of games, from early 8-bit to modern consoles.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazzard,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "103106": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1061319.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ricard L\u00f3pez Fogu\u00e9s"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Ricky Hunter", "Mark Hyzer", "Lluis Valls Mart\u00ed", "Lucas Soriano", "Jeff Ward"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Kardfy Studios"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1061319_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Collectible Components", "Fantasy", "Fighting"], "description": "Draconian Wars is a game of combat, resource management and battlefield tactics.

To truly master the Galaxy, you have to do more than just build space ships and lasers, in fact... right now those are relatively unimportant advancements in this game.<br/><br/>The gameplay is similar to a cross between Risk and Magic The Gathering.<br/><br/>Play should only take a few minutes to learn how to play, but the complexity of the strategic possibility increases nearly exponentially as the gameplay deepens.  There are 13 different types of interactions possible when interacting with an opponent, each of these pathways offers a different style of gameplay, and each one has been mastered by a different culture of the Galaxy.  Each group has different weaknesses and strengths, and can be seen as a hero, or a villain... depending on your game strategy.<br/><br/>Learn trade and master transportation in The Circle of Life, master data archiving and planetary engineering in The Order of the Singularity, and befriend multidimensional predators or hire anarchist hackers in The Forgotten... as you try to build a culture rich enough to become a member of The Elite, mysterious beings with capabilities and resources spanning every level of life.<br/><br/>This is a game unlike most others. I agree with those who said that a good strategy game takes minutes to learn and a lifetime to master. There are elements of this system that I have been working on developing for over two decades.<br/>I think that the loss of magic and mystery we experience with some of our scientific observations may be restored, and a more healthy balance of life can be found through respecting the Macro Organic life and finding new ways to interact with them... also learning to respect the old ways in a new light.<br/><br/>This manual is divided into two sections, the quick start section (for those who want to just dive right in and start playing), and the Galactic Primer (for those of you who enjoy learning about the deeper backstory of the Universe of Katalyka).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "11", "name": "Katalyka", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Pattern Building", "Route/Network Building", "Trading", "Variable Player Powers"], "average": "1.25", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "103116": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Hall of Fire (Issue 76 - Nov 2010)", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["Jeff Ifland", "Micah A.

It was announced on April 8, 2010 and is stated to include John Carpenter helping on the cinematics as well as writer Steve Niles.<br/><br/>F.E.A.R. 3 includes features such as co-op, an evolved cover system, and more scares, according to Day 1 Studios founder and president Denny Thorley. In the game, the players control either Point Man or Paxton Fettel, the protagonist and antagonist, respectively, from the first game, F.E.A.R.. The controls for the Point Man are the same, with shooting enemies and slowing time. As Fettel, you assist the Point Man by using telekinesis, stun, possession, and other abilities. Also, the game has both online and offline Co-Op play. And as confirmed at last year's E3, there is split-screen Co-Op. Once you complete a level as Point Man, in the single player mode, you can then replay that level as Paxton Fettel.<br/><br/>There are four game modes that are going to be included in F.E.A.R. 3 multiplayer. The four game modes are &quot;F---ing Run&quot; &quot;Contractions&quot; &quot;Soul Survivor&quot; and &quot;Soul King&quot;. &quot;F---ing Run&quot; features 4 players running through waves of enemies, all the while running from Alma's massive &quot;Wall of Death.&quot; The players start off in a safe room and proceed through levels, killing enemies within a certain amount of time. There are several safe rooms throughout the mode, and if a player is downed, one of the co-op players can revive them. If one player is killed the game is over. &quot;Contractions&quot; is a survival round-based game mode where you must barricade and stock up weapons against 20 waves of enemies from the F.E.A.R. 3 single player, similar to Call of Duty's &quot;Nazi Zombies,&quot; although the farther you increase through the waves the tougher it gets by adding a fog effect that creeps closer and closer making the map much more dangerous. &quot;Soul Survivor&quot; has four players pitted against each other with one player playing as a &quot;Spectre&quot; in which he or she has to possess enemies to kill the other three players and turn them into Spectres before the time runs out. &quot;Soul King&quot; is similar to Soul Survivor but with the exception that all the players play as Spectres and must possess enemies to kill each other and collect dropped souls. Teamwork and cooperation is needed for players to win in the game modes.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;F.E.A.R. 3&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>STORY<br/><br/>Eight months ago, Point Man and his F.E.A.R. squad were tapped to stop an unknown man who had commandeered a secret battalion of telepathically-controlled supersoldiers at the Armacham research facility in the Northwestern US city of Fairport. During the mission Point Man learned that the man wasn&rsquo;t working alone. In fact, the very people Point Man was working to destroy were his telepathic, cannibalistic brother, Paxton Fettel, and his tortured and psychically powerful mother, Alma Wade&mdash;products of Armacham&rsquo;s perverse paranormal experiments. Despite this revelation, Point Man moved forward with the standing F.E.A.R. team orders to stop the targets at any cost. In a last-ditch attempt to end the pair&rsquo;s homicidal rampage, the F.E.A.R. team set in motion an explosive series of events that seemingly accomplished their goal but at the cost of ravaging the city, its inhabitants and almost all of Point Man&rsquo;s squad mates.<br/> For months following the blast, events in Fairport have made it clear that Alma&rsquo;s psychic influence survived&mdash;and worse, her paranormal power is growing and spilling into reality. Now her supernatural agony repeatedly rocks the city as she attempts to secure the survival of her bloodline and reunite her family. Armacham&rsquo;s security force remains violently focused on eliminating all evidence of the events in the city, and the remaining F.E.A.R squad carries on the mission to stop Alma.<br/> With the chain of command broken and Point Man calling his own shots, where will his allegiance lie? With his brother Paxton Fettel, back from the dead, arriving with an unclear agenda and refusing to leave Point Man&rsquo;s side? With his pregnant mother Alma and her horrifically twisted, yet immensely powerful paranormal existence? Or with his remaining F.E.A.R. squad brethren who are hell bent on saving the world, but at the cost of destroying the only blood ties Point Man has ever had?<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "103128": {"poll": [], "name": "Battles of Destiny", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American DOS edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1045248.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Military", "Science Fiction", "War - Future"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Several Dudes' Holistic Gaming, Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Quantum Quality Productions"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1045248_t.jpg", "description": "Back of Box<br/><br/>Conquer the world in &quot;Battles of Destiny.&quot; Seek out and destroy up to three opponents in this state of the art global conquest simulation.

Just as in a real ecosystem, each different species occupies its own niche, with different food requirements, fighting ability, speed, and favored habitats. The arrangement of the various habitats changes from game to game. To play the game well, a player must determine which combination of species will be most advantageous on a given board, and place their dinosaurs in locations where they will be able to find food and mates and avoid being eaten.<br/><br/>Game-play: Play is organized into rounds. Each round consists of the players' turns and an End Phase in which the board is adjusted to prepare for the next round. Each player begins with 10 points of dinosaurs on the board, and increases this point total in two ways: (1) by successfully breeding dinosaurs to produce eggs, which hatch into new dinosaurs at the end of the round; (2) by introducing a new species during the End Phase.<br/>During a turn, a player rolls dice to determine the locations of new plant growth on the board, migrates dinosaurs to new locations, and attempts to feed and breed dinosaurs.  For predators, feeding involves hunting other dinosaurs.  Other players become involved with the current player's turn when their dinosaurs are hunted, and they must choose to fight or flee, and when they choose to play a card that impacts the current player's actions.<br/>During the End Phase, fresh kills become rotten carcasses, rotten carcasses rot away entirely, hungry dinosaurs starve, eggs hatch, and players have an opportunity to choose one of four improvements for the following round (various combinations of new dinosaurs, eggs, and cards).<br/><br/>Goal: The game ends when at least one player has reached 40 points at the end of a round.

Who will become the most successful gem trading mogul?<br/><br/>Zavandor is a fantasy setting which revolves around a capitalist economy based on trading in gems - sapphires, rubies, mystical gems etc. Other games in the family include Mines of Zavandor, and The Scepter of Zavandor.<br/><br/>Gnomes of Zavandor features two central boards. The first is a grid with markers indicating the current price of each of the gem types, and also indicating whether the price is going to go up or down next turn. Gems can be bought (or sold) for cash in the first phase of each turn. Buying gems makes them more valuable in subsequent turns; selling them reduces their value, and this is reflected on the grid. These gems can be used to buy tiles from the second board, a star-shaped arena featuring &quot;mining rights&quot; tiles positioned randomly around it. The position on the board indicates the cost to purchase these mining rights; the cost will be a mixed selection of coloured gems. At the end of each turn, players gain new gems according to the mining rights they have acquired and this affects the central economy, generally reducing the value of the relevant gems when they are purchased for hard cash, in future rounds.<br/><br/>The initial phase of the turn involves buying gems, selling gems, taking gold, trading with the central supply, and purchasing cards and tokens (with gems rather than cash). The items available for purchase include equipment improving your efficiency, jewels providing victory points, and mining rights. The second phase of the turn involves mining for new gems. Each player takes the gems they are allowed according to their mining rights. At the end of each turn, the market values are adjusted according to the actions which have occurred; the price of the available equipment is discounted (this rule is optional); and another area of the star-shaped board becomes accessible with more mining-rights available to purchase in the next round.<br/><br/>The game continues until one player has reached a victory-point target, dependent on the number of players in the game.

The new age of the Mercenary had dawned and with it, ruthless Men and Women took on combat and bloody warfare for assets, money, and power.

The player who lays out the best plan and builds the most appealing structure to the proper height at the right time will win.<br/><br/>Each turn, players either draw a new tile, exchange two of their tiles for two new tiles or play a tile from their hand to their board.

After every round, points are scored according to the number of dots visible on a player's board, points are lost for tiles still in hand and bonus points are added for tiles at the level of the round that just ended.  For example, at the end of round 1 players earn 1 point per tile at level 1.  The bonuses have the potential to score much higher after rounds 2 and 3.  At the end of the game, players earn a bonus by squaring the highest level on which they have a tile (e.g. having a tile at level 5 earns a bonus of 25 points).<br/><br/>"}, "103260": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1050634.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Justin Gary"], "statistics": [], "boardgamecompilation": ["Ascension: Year One Collector's Edition"], "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Eric Sabee"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Arclight", "Asmodee", "FunBox Jogos", "Stone Blade Entertainment"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1050634_t.png", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy"], "description": "August 20-21 Game Day promo.

The stakes are as high as they come: literal survival for your citizens and your democratic way of life.<br/><br/>Each year, you must decide to allocate some resources into massive espionage efforts to locate enemy bases and industrial centers, or concentrate effort into producing more engines of nuclear destruction. You must choose among jet fighter-bombers, land-based missiles, missile submarines, or anti-ballistic missiles.<br/><br/>Your neighboring country is controlled by a cold and calculating computer whose sole objective is to annihilate you utterly!

It is a 4X turn-based strategic level space warfare game. The game consists of several scenarios that grow in complexity, starting with a solitaire situation that acts as a tutorial in resource management, through set two-player scenarios involving more and more planets and ships. The game also has a scenario creation tool. Games can be played against a computer or human opponent.<br/><br/>The map consists of 16 space sectors which vary in size and shape. Despite this, all sectors have 40 planets in them. There are four types of planets in the game: terran, industrial, mining, and farming. Terran planets on their own can produce industrial output (IO). Industrial output is what constitutes income in the game. The remaining types of planets can only produce IO by collectively forming what is called a commerce net.<br/><br/>There are 15 classes of ships. Ships can travel inside or to an adjacent sector to perform missions. Ships have varying capabilities - cost, attack strength, defensive strength, speed, etc. - but the three main qualities of a ship are, hull size, whether they carry cargo or not, and what type of jump drive (called Warp Drive in the game) range they have. These qualities determine which type of mission or missions they are best suited for.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved either by the game itself randomly calculating a result or allows an interface with The Cosmic Balance I, the tactical level space combat game preceding Cosmic Balance II. The interface between the two games is essentially manual. In this case, Cosmic Balance II lists the ship types involved in the battle, the type of Cosmic Balance I scenario which corresponds to the Cosmic Balance II mission being performed, and the tech levels of the combatants.

It runs on Namco System 86 hardware. Over a decade later, the game was released in America and Europe in the video game compilation Namco Museum Vol. 4 under the title of The Genji and the Heike Clans.<br/><br/>The player makes his way along a Yamato-e painting landscape fighting enemies as they appear. The game offers three types of action: Small Mode (standard), Big Mode (standard, but with large characters and usually boss fights) and Plain Mode (viewed from an overhead perspective). Most stages have torii, which are used to transport the player to a different stage. On most stages featured in Side Mode and Plain Mode, there are multiple torii that can be entered which will lead to different routes on the map. In Big Mode, however, there is only one torii at the end of this type of stage.<br/><br/>The leading character is a historical Japanese samurai, Taira no Kagekiyo (also known as Akushichiby\u014de Kagekiyo) who fell in the Battle of Dan-no-ura at the end of the Genpei War. In Genpei T\u014dma Den, he was resurrected and fights Minamoto no Yoshitsune and Saito Musashibo Benkei over the Imperial Regalia of Japan, as well as to defeat his enemy Minamoto no Yoritomo.<br/><br/>The game also features the Sanzu River, a place believed in Japanese Buddhism to separate &quot;the current life&quot; and &quot;the afterlife&quot;, resembling the concept of the Underworld or Hell (The river is often identified with the River Styx in Greek Mythology). Therefore, some mythological characters like Emma-o (\u95bb\u9b54\u5927\u738b; literally &quot;Enma Dai-o&quot;), god of the Underworld, and the Sun Goddess Amaterasu appear in the game.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Genpei T\u014dma Den&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "103275": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Spacca 15", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Betting/Wagering", "Memory"], "yearpublished": "1975", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1055415_t.png", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Clementoni"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1055415.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Trivia"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Italian board game of the '70, based on the quiz show &quot;Spaccaquindici&quot;.<br/>Three players try to answer questions to identify characters and events through pictures or meaning of common words.<br/>The mechanism of the game also included the typical actions of some card games, how to bet or fold, so the player must have skills typical of game of chance in addition to the mnemonic knowledge.<br/>The player who scores 15 points is the winner.<br/><br/>"}, "103276": {"poll": [], "name": "River King: A Wonderful Journey", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese TurboGrafx-16 CD edition", "Wii Virtual Console edition"], "average": "7", "videogameseries": ["River King"], "videogametheme": ["Anime", "Fishing"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Pack-In-Video"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["TurboGrafx-16", "Wii"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Marvelous Entertainment", "Pack-In-Video"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Kawa no Nushi Tsuri: Shizenha is the second game in the River King series.

They are plated with armor and equipped with devastating weapons. Conventional weapons of war (infantry, tanks, pair and space ships) are generally all but useless against them.

While inside their fighting machine, the mecha pilot is mainly concerned with battle. However, this is but a small portion of their life (and the story). When outside their mecha their life is full of other drama. Personal problems, love interests (or disinterests), dark secrets, self doubt, and all sorts of conflicts with friend, foe, and even oneself are what make the story interesting.<br/><br/>"}, "103315": {"poll": [], "name": "Rats!", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Gameboy Color edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1063379.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon", "Crime"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Tarantula Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["Game Boy Color"], "average": "6", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc."], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1063379_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/>This is a platform game.

Its seas are large, but often relatively shallow, though filled with an abundance of fish and other life, which perhaps compensates for the often-empty and seemingly desolate stretches of land that reach to the horizon. Arannoch is a land of endless roads, far-off cities, and forgotten ruins, all beneath a sky that is heated by the blazing sun by day, and yet chilled by the winds at night. It is a world of extremes, where only the hardy survive. And yet, despite the hostile environment, life flourishes on this world, though it is not dense or plentiful, but it is persistent and can be found in all but the most remote and sun-baked deserts.<br/><br/>Many centuries ago, it is said that Arannoch was a far more lush world, and it&rsquo;s lands grew green and rains fell plentifully, and the world was like that of a tropical jungle. But then the Godswar came upon this remote world, as the gods of Good fought the final battle against Sarkophka, the Undead Lord of Plagues. It was here that the defeated god made his last stand, and it is on this world that his tomb lies buried in the wastes, nearly forgotten by all. Centuries past, the tales became myths, and even they gradually faded, crumbling like the mountains of this now-cursed world.<br/><br/>After that war, the land is said to have changed&hellip; perhaps the stories are only that, but the legends say that Arannoch soon lost its lush forests and verdant fields, only to have them replaced with brushland and deserts. Many scoff at these tales, saying that there is no way a world could change so drastically in such short order, and most pay no heed to the older men and women who whisper of the way things used to be or even of the Godswar itself.<br/><br/>Now, life on Arannoch is more difficult, yet still flourishing where it can. The desert can be merciless, and the rains never come as often one would hope, but those who are wily, cunning, and skillful can make a good life for themselves on this world. Trade flourishes, large wars are generally unknown (though border skirmishes and highway raiders are a matter of daily life), and science is beginning to rise amid a culture steeped in superstition. In all, life isn&rsquo;t too bad on this little desert world &ndash; legends of a greener age excluded, of course &ndash; but far too few even recall the name of the horror that lies buried on their world&hellip;<br/><br/>"}, "103317": {"poll": [], "name": "G.T.R. 2 Fia GT Racing Game", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Windows Edition"], "average": "9", "videogametheme": ["Driving"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Viva Media"], "videogamegenre": ["Racing"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "videogamehonor": ["2006 Spike Best Driving Game of the Year Nominee"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Viva Media"], "description": "GTR2 is a sports car racing simulator developed under license by Blimey for SimBin for the x86 PC and is a sequel to GTR.

GARBAGE cards worth negative points, so players will try to recycle them, that is, to get rid of them. <br/>As to the CONTAINER cards, these worth positive points (from 1 to 5, in each colour), and are placed in the center of the table. These are drawn one at a time. <br/>For each CONTAINER card,  players can bet any number of cards of the correspondent colour from their hand. Whenever all players pass, the highest bet wins that CONTAINER card (place it next to him, worthing points) and discards the GARBAGE cards that he has bet, meaning those were recycled.

It is one map, with 60 or so combat units (both players) in action at any given time.  This allows for a pace of play not possible with the previously published OCS monster games. Regardless of the reduction in scale it remains an OCS game with all features relevant to the system.  In this game there can be wide open, swirling, DAK-like battles in the desert (with some: limited armor forces), river lines to break, and very rough, mountainous terrain to contend with. The British have the possibility of an amphibious invasion.  Naval shore bombardments, by both sides, can be important in the early part of the campaign. There is a small but significant air campaign.  As always in the OCS, supply constraints make each player feel he may be on the edge of disaster.<br/><br/>This campaign remains a footnote in WWII history even among many knowledgeable enthusiasts.  However, given the nature of events in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations during the first half of 1941, this campaign was arguably the hot spot in the world at that moment in time.[...]<br/><br/>The Vichy were well equipped and organized. They put up stiff opposition, and counterattacked with great effect. The Commonwealth and Free French forces, at first, were stopped cold. Ironically, it was the failure of Operation Battleaxe (June 15) in the Western desert that allowed reinforcements for this campaign from the Western Desert and a resumption of the Commonwealth offensive. After Damascus fell, Beirut was seriously threatened and with Indian 10th division troops (along with Habforce) moving on Aleppo and Homs to the North, the Vichy proposed an armistice to end the fighting.<br/><br/>The armistice was signed on July 14.

There are three different Westeros Decks, and each denotes a different global action, potentially affecting all players.<br/><br/>The Planning Phase is perhaps the most important. Here you secretly assign orders to all of your units by placing one order token face down on each area you control that contains at least one unit (Knight, Footman, Ship, or Siege Engine). This portion of the game emphasizes diplomacy and deduction. Can you trust the alliance that you made? Will you betray your ally and march upon him? Players may make promises to each other (for aid or peace, for example), but these promises are never binding. The result is tense and compelling negotiations, often ending in backstabbing worthy of Westeros!<br/><br/>During the Action Phase, the orders are resolved and battle is entered! When armies meet in combat, they secretly choose one of their House cards to add strength to the battle. Finally, the Houses can consolidate their power in the areas they control and use that power in future turns to influence their position in the court of the Iron Throne and to stand against the wildling Hordes.<br/><br/>In addition to featuring updated graphics and a clarified ruleset, this second edition of A Game of Thrones includes elements from the A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords expansions, including ports, garrisons, Wildling cards, and Siege engines, while introducing welcome new innovations like player screens and Tides of Battle cards.<br/><br/>Tides of Battle cards are an optional mechanism that brings an element of unpredictability to combat, representing erratic shifts in the momentum of war due to factors such as weather, morale, and tactical opportunity. During each combat, both players draw one Tides of Battle card from a communal deck, and its value modifies the strength of his chosen House card. What's more, such a card may also contain icons that can affect the outcome of the battle...all of which delivers a new level of intensity to your military engagements.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) \u2013 A Dance with Dragons (2012)<br/>     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) \u2013 A Feast for Crows (2013)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Reimplements:<br/><br/>     A Game of Thrones (first edition) (2003)<br/>     A Game of Thrones: A Clash of Kings Expansion (2004)<br/>     A Game of Thrones: A Storm of Swords Expansion (2006)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["Brazilian first edition", "Bulgarian edition", "Chinese edition", "Czech First Edition", "Dutch first edition", "English second edition", "French edition", "German second edition", "Hebrew edition", "Hungarian first edition", "Italian second edition", "Korean Edition", "Polish second edition", "Romanian first edition", "Russian Second Edition", "Spanish second edition"], "average": "7.73604", "name": "A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Area Movement", "Auction/Bidding", "Hand Management", "Player Elimination", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": ["124693", "140261"], "usersrated": "17955", "boardgameaccessory": ["A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) \u2013 e-Raptor organizer"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["A Game of Thrones: The Board Game", "A Song of Ice and Fire"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BGA Ep 52 - 15 Predictions for 2015", "BGA Episode 100 - Top 100 Games of All Time", "BGTG 131 - 100 Great Games, part 1 (with Stephen Glenn &amp; Mark Jackson)", "Board2Death Podcast Episode 5 - Introductions Round One", "D6G Ep 93: Perils of Publishing and Game of Thrones Detailed Review", "DJ18: Especial Sant Jordi: jocs i literatura", "Ep 20 Top 5 Games", "Ep 30 Board Games for Beginners", "Ep. 15 3D Printing &amp; Negotiation", "Ep. 18 Tail Feathers With Jerry Hawthorne", "Episode 3 - The Baby\u2019s Asleep\u2026Quick, Grab a Game!", "Episode 34 : Scythe Review + Interview with Lance \"Undead Viking\" Myxter", "Episode 6 And The Winner Is\u2026", "Episode 8: Super Dungeon Explore: Forgotten King, Timecop, and Battleheart: Legacy", "Episodio 11 \u2013 Especial verano 2013: Juegos no jugados", "I've Been Diced! episode 10: Gateway games", "Il Giocatore - Episodio 2 - Game Of Thrones", "Polyhedron Collider Cast Episode 2", "RDTN Episode 56 \u2013 Reminiscing: Tiny Epic Galaxies, 2014 Look Back, Game of Thrones, and Camel Up", "The Long View: Game of Thrones", "What Did You Play this Week Podcast Thing Week 79", "\uc81c83\ud68c \uac8c\uc784 \ub300 \uac8c\uc784 - \ubc18\uc9c0 \uc804\uc7c1 vs. \uc655\uc88c\uc758 \uac8c\uc784"]}, "103344": {"poll": [], "name": "Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American PlayStation 3 edition", "PSN PlayStation 3 Downloadable edition", "Windows Downloadable edition", "XBLA Xbox 360 Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1291601.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Martial Arts"], "videogamefranchise": ["Street Fighter"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Capcom Co., Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 3", "Windows", "Xbox 360"], "usersrated": "33", "average": "8.01212", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Capcom Co., Ltd."], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1291601_t.jpg", "description": "From the Official Website:<br/>Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition features a roster of 39 characters such as Ryu, Chun-li, Juri, El Fuerte, and Rufus, while adding 4 new characters to the roster including classic combatants from previous Street Fighter games like Yun and Yang as well as the all-new Oni.

It was created by Art Canfil and the company Mega Micro Computers, and published by Avalanche Productions.<br/><br/>The game Taipan! was inspired by the novel Tai-Pan by James Clavell. The player is in the role of a trader in the Far East. He owns a ship, and may decide if he wishes to start without any cash but five guns, or with some cash and a debt.<br/><br/>The goal is to accumulate wealth through trade and possibly also through booty won in battles against pirates. As soon as the player's net worth reaches one million (in the game's undefined currency), the player has the option to retire.<br/><br/>The basic strategy of the game is to buy goods (opium, silk, arms, and general cargo) at a low price and sell them at a higher price. The silk, arms, and general cargo have no special features; opium is special in that it can be confiscated at random points by the local authorities, resulting in a fine for the player. This makes dealing in opium riskier than dealing in the other goods; however, it is also in general the most profitable item for trade.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://www.wikipedia.com/Taipan%21,&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://www.wikipedia.com/Taipan%21,&quot</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "103351": {"poll": [], "name": "Road to the Capital", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1049328_t.png", "average": "7.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["The Game Crafter, LLC"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1049328.png", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Destroy the Capital to Win <br/>1943, during World War II. <br/>Leading your army, you must capture opponent nation destroying the its Capital city. <br/>Do not let the enemy come on over your city.<br/><br/>Rules<br/>Each player plays with a pack of cards &ldquo;Nation&rdquo; (50 cards), made up by Vehicles, Cities, Fortuity etc.<br/>The game consists of rounds in which one player attacks and another one defends.

Epigo's simultaneous action selection makes every round of the game exciting, even though Epigo features relatively simple rules and mechanics.  Epigo is also modular - the boxed game includes rules for 21 variants, with more variants available on our website.  Variants modify one or more of the core rules, providing unique challenges and adding countless hours of replayability.<br/><br/>The Rules<br/><br/>To win, be the first to capture three of your opponents&rsquo; Epigons by pushing them off the edge of the board.  Epigons have a rank between 1 and 7 dictating the speed at which they move.  At the start of every round, both players choose and stack three Orders from their hand. The top Order of a stack marks the first move, the middle tile is the second move, and the third tile is the last move.  Each Order has arrows on one side, indicating the direction the corresponding Epigon will try to move.  Once both players have locked in their moves, the stacks are revealed and unraveled.  First, compare the top Order on each stack.  The higher ranking Epigon moves one space in the direction shown on the arrows.  Then the other Epigon (matching the lower priority Order) moves in the same manner.  If both players reveal Orders of the same rank they cancel and neither Epigon moves (players often try to make this happen intentionally for various nefarious purposes). After three moves, players pick up all of their Orders and start the next round.<br/><br/>When moving an Epigon, one of three things will happen: it will Slide, Push, or be Blocked.  When an Epigon moves into an empty space, it Slides into it. If that space is occupied however, the Epigon tries to Push in that direction instead.  An Epigon must have a majority of friendly pieces moving in the same direction whenever it tries to Push otherwise the move is Blocked.  The full rulebook contains detailed explanations of the movement rules, and is available on our website.<br/><br/>The boxed game accomodates up to 4 players in teams of 2, and introduces variant play.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "name": "Epigo", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "238", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "average": "6.83993"}, "103370": {"poll": [], "name": "TOCA World Touring Cars", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["European PlayStation edition", "European PlayStation Platinum edition", "NA PlayStation edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3558097.jpg", "videogameseries": ["TOCA Touring Car"], "videogametheme": ["Driving"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Codemasters"], "videogamegenre": ["Racing"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Codemasters"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3558097_t.jpg", "description": "TOCA World Touring Cars (called Jarrett &amp; Labonte Stock Car Racing in the USA and WTC: World Touring Car Championship in Japan) is a racing video game developed and published by Codemasters, and released in 2000 for PlayStation and Game Boy Advance.

This upset a lot of fans of the series, but success continued. The gameplay overall became more &quot;arcadey&quot; and the replacement of qualifying laps with random grid positions together with the omission of penalties for bad driving made the game much more playable for the casual gamer. The game was billed as the first PlayStation game to feature 14 cars on the track, which pushed the console to its absolute limit.

Players spend the majority of their time on the road, navigating the highways between the game's six cities: Salt Sea City, Capital City, Greenback, Skeeter's Creek, Smokestack Heights, and Big Mutha Truckin' Incorporated. The player will earn most of his or her money through trade, shipping goods from cell phones to beer, with additional opportunities from mini-games and challenge races.<br/><br/>Every city features three locations: a garage, a bar, and a store. The garage allowed players to repair damage, refuel, switch trailers to carry different kinds of cargo, buy upgrades to improve their rig, or design custom logos for their truck. In the bar the player can find tips on where to buy and sell certain cargo, and a loan shark. The store allows the player to buy and sell goods, with prices varying by town. When visiting Big Mutha Truckin' Incorporated, the bar and store are replaced by visits to Ma Jackson.<br/><br/>On the road, the player can earn extra money by smashing other vehicles. This money can be multiplied through combos, or by hitting a vehicle with the trailer. If the player earns a high enough combo, he can make reward icons appear on the road. When collected, these icons can refuel the truck, repair damage, or offer a cash bonus. Police and biker gangs are both present in the game, and cause trouble for the player if he or she attacks them by mistake. Police officers will pursue and arrest the player, while bikers will attempt to shoot up the trailer, or even detach it from the truck. In either case, its a significant blow to the player's cash. Police can be avoided with skillful driving, and bikers can be shaken off the truck.<br/><br/>Occasionally, the player will be asked to accomplish a side-mission when he or she visits a bar. These simple point-to-point races are good for cash if the player can complete them.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Big Mutha Truckers&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "103381": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Bjorn Reichel", "Christian Steimel"], "poll": [], "name": "Triumph & Tragedy", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Variable Phase Order"], "yearpublished": "2007", "boardgameexpansion": ["103599", "104888"], "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1049643_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Tischrabauken Production"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1049643.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Miniatures", "Wargame"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Skirmish Wargame Rules 1900-1939<br/><br/>From the back cover:<br/>&quot;Triumph and Tragedy is a set of wargame rules that allows for both straigth historical games as well as those with a cinematic, more adventurous approach.<br/><br/>You can re-enact conflicts in settings as diverse as Russia, China, India, Darkest Africa an many more.&quot;<br/><br/>Every player has a card for every squad or vehicle, cards are piled in secret order and turned over one every turn.

Players continue to play rounds until all of the stones in the supply are gone.<br/><br/>Card selections include HUNT and GATHER - which allow you to take varying amounts of stones from the supply. Each deck also includes a RAID card for each opponent - which allows you to take half of their stones.

Designed by Tom Russell, Prepotent blends the short term tactical thinking found in its streamlined racing mechanisms with the long term strategy of horse breeding. Additional intrigue is found in the betting mechanisms: Do you want your horse to strive for only second place so the opponents lose their bets?<br/><br/>In game terms, each player has two horses: one stallion and one mare. When players breed horses, they breed their mare to other players' stallions, and each player can set a stud fee for how much this costs. Players must decide if they want to breed a new stallion or new mare; with a new mare, desirable traits will last longer, but with a superior stallion, races are more likely to be won in the immediate future.<br/><br/>Players can bet on each horse to win, place, or show. Money is made both by successful bets and by the player's own horse placing well in races. In addition, the older a player's horse is, the slower it becomes, but the more money it makes if it places well in races.<br/><br/>Each horse has a set of traits, and when a new horse is bred, the most desirable traits are what players strive for.  Parent horses that are genetically compatible can offer gene traits superior to unmatched mates.  Each of these traits represents an action the horse is required to take during the course of the race.  Each race is four rounds long, and each horse has four traits, so each horse will use every one of its traits, helpful or hindering.<br/><br/>Players acquire money by setting stud fees that other players must pay to breed with their stallions, winning bets on races, and having their own horse place well in races.

After the opening level the game becomes a traditional platform game where the player must guide Mr Wimpy across the platforms whilst walking over four various burger ingredients which in turn causes them to crash to the platform below and finally to the four plates at the bottom.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Wimpy,&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Wimpy,&quot</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&uml;<br/><br/>"}, "103460": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Zara Downs", "Mary Flanagan", "Max Seidman"], "poll": [], "name": "POX: Save the People", "playingtime": "35", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Enclosure", "Co-operative Play", "Pattern Building", "Simulation"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "14", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1061144_t.png", "average": "7.89286", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Mary Flanagan LLC", "Tiltfactor"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1061144.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "35", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Educational", "Medical"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "35", "description": "Pox: Save the People is a new board game challenging 1-4 players to stop the spread of a deadly disease. Not only is the game fun, but through play, players understand group immunity and the need to vaccinate. Players ages 7-65, and both casual and hardcore gamers have enjoyed POX.<br/><br/>Players cooperate to vaccinate and cure people on the board until the disease is fully contained, before the number of deaths exceeds acceptable losses or the disease becomes out of control. The players win or lose together. Players alternate drawing cards. Each card specifies how the disease spreads, and then which public health resources the player has available for allocation. It's important to protect the vulnerable people on the board, because if they become infected, they immediately die. But watch out! Don't neglect the infected people because they can die too if the infection gets too bad!<br/><br/>Many public health groups need to better promote immunizations in order to continue to prevent vaccine preventable diseases. Vaccinations against deadly diseases such as diphtheria, polio, and whooping cough were standard public health measures, and they worked: kids today don&rsquo;t worry about getting polio, for example. But due to suspicions about vaccines and links to other diseases, more parents are refusing to immunize their children, and this could lead to a national health crisis. Parents mistakenly believe that vaccines aren&rsquo;t necessary any more, or that children develop immunity to these diseases automatically through time. These myths lead to disaster. Whooping cough is back, for example, for the U.S. has lost what is called herd immunity to this disease as the percent of vaccinated people is lowering, allowing ways for contagion to spread among the populace.<br/><br/>Between POX's unique packaging and gameplay, what's stopping YOU from saving the people?!<br/><br/>"}, "103461": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1049966.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Matt Worden"], "statistics": [], "boardgamecompilation": ["Dicey Curves: Deluxe Edition"], "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": ["Matt Worden"], "boardgamepublisher": ["The Game Crafter, LLC", "Matt Worden Games"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1049966_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Racing"], "description": "Dicey Curves is a dice-driven car racing game, where the track is constructed from a deck of cards.

The goal of the game is essentially to cause your opponent to lose by causing their gameplay field to fill to the top with objects. You do this by causing chains of bombs to explode, sending useless rubble over to your opponent's field, which they must then remove themselves. Bombs are earned by causing chains of three identical blocks to disappear. Bombs can only be blown up with an explosion from a lit bomb, which falls from the top of the screen every so often. If the player causes enough damage, they can eventually earn a giant bomb, which will remove a large amount of debris from the playing field, and cause their opponent a good deal of trouble.<br/><br/>The game's regular story mode revolves around Bomberman's hunt for the Golden Bomber statue. During his trek, he fights against several different odd characters, like Drifty the balloon, or Cecil the tiger. However, all that can really be earned from playing through this mode is a harder difficulty level, earned by finishing the entire story at the &quot;hard&quot; difficulty level. The player's progress is saved by a password system.<br/><br/>Panic Bomber was ported to the Neo Geo, Virtual Boy (known in Japan as Tobidase!
