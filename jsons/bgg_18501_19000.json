With 2 players one must place 7 buildings in order to win (there are 13 spaces). With 3-4 players one must achieve at least 12 points to be the winner. Each round is divided into three phases.<br/><br/>In the first phase each player decides the number of steps that he wants to move one of his building. Accordingly it takes and puts as many Oracle stones into its right hand, while keeping the remaining Oracle stones covered in the left hand. Every player place a bet on the total amount of Oracle stones that will be played in the current round by all players (it's not permitted to call a number already called by a previous player). After each player called a value, everyone open their right hand, and if someone called the exact value, he will have benefits in the third phase.<br/><br/>In the second phase every player moves one of his buildings (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) according to number of Oracle stones played. During the movement one can jump over one or more buildings, but the target field must be however free. If one jumps over an opponent building with the next to last point of movement, he can strike this at the end of its movement, if he wants to. The building is then put again into the supply of the opponent.<br/><br/>In the third phase only the player that called exactly the value in the first phase can place one of its temple on a free starting position on the board.

The player who manages to get all of his game figures into his own star corner first wins the game.  A blockade figure constantly changes the aspect of the game.<br/><br/>Piggy Back - The object of the game is to get all the figures across the board first, whereby the players are forced at times to carry the opponent's figures &quot;piggy-back&quot; across the board or even to be carried in the same way themselves in order to reach their destination.  The point of the game is to try to take advantage of the piggy back rule whenever possible.<br/><br/>Fox Jumping - A gathering of foxes (2 or 4 fox families make 40 foxes) is disturbed by a hunting party.  Hastily each fox tried to hide in one of the 39 neighboring dens.  But since there is room for one fox in each den, the slowest fox loses the race.<br/><br/>Surakarta - This game originated in Indonesia.

The idea is to move your pawns around the grid trying to get to a curved line that can be used to move to another side of the board and more importantly eliminate your opponents pawn.

Around the building site, a city is slowly rising up.<br/><br/>The players embody master builders. By building the King's castle and developing the city around it, they earn prestige points and gain the King's favor. When the castle is finished, the player who has earned the most prestige wins the game.  The expansion Caylus Expansion: The Jeweller was included in the 2nd Edition.<br/><br/>Each turn, players pay to place their workers in various buildings in the village. These buildings allow players to gather resources or money, or to build or upgrade buildings with those resources. Players can also use their resources to help build the castle itself, earning points and favors from the king, which provide larger bonuses. Building a building provides some immediate points, and potentially income throughout the game, since players receive bonuses when others use their buildings. The buildings chosen by the players have a heavy impact on the course of the game, since they determine the actions that will be available to all the players.<br/><br/>As new buildings are built, they stretch along a road stretching away from the castle, and not all buildings can be used every turn. Players have some control over which buildings are active by paying to influence the movement of the Provost marker. The final position of the marker is the newest building that can be used that turn. The Provost marker also helps determine the movement of the Bailiff marker, which determines the end of the game.

Physics-based systems model aircraft performance differences correctly and simply through the use of only two elegant playaids; graphical computers known as nomograms. Missiles fly out towards their targets without player intervention, using proper kinematics from launch and flowing seamlessly into the underlying flight engine. The core of Birds of Prey is the PHAD - the Pitch, Heading, and Attitude Display, a simple tool allowing players to track their the orientation of an aircraft in three dimensions. The PHAD makes it trivial to find the relative position (bearings) and relative motion between maneuvering aircraft. It also makes figuring blind spots where you can't sight other aircraft a trivial exercise, regardless of whether the aircraft is flying straight and level, has its nose pointing straight up, or is in the middle of a wingover.<br/><br/>The lavishly illustrated Birds of Prey tutorial guides you through learning the game solo, while the rulebook is a reference for rules questions only. The play aids are built to keep the rulebook in the box during play. Laminated play-aids use a system of hints that lead players through flight and eases return to play.

This phase may constitute a full-fledged game in itself (see Variant below).  It is then a challenge of trying to guess the scent in each aroma vial (the answer is on the bottom).<br/><br/>These aromas are divided into 4 groups:<br/> &middot;  21 primary reference aromas (varietal aromas), ex: leather, licorice, apricot, etc....<br/> &middot;  7 secondary aromas (wine-making aromas), ex: cinnamon, lemon, etc....<br/> &middot;  7 tertiary aromas (aromas of aging), ex: prune, mushroom, etc....<br/> &middot;  5 odors indicating the principal defects found in wine, ex: detergent, cork, etc....<br/><br/>2nd Phase: The game itself. Each players has been asked to bring a bottle of wine.  All players have taken care to conceal the label from the other players.  The person whose wine is being tasted will temporarily be the game moderator while all others will try to answer the questions regarding the wine&rsquo;s origin, vintage, grape varietal, defects, vinification process, aging potential, outcome, balance, etc.  Sounds difficult or impossible?  It&rsquo;s not&mdash;and here&rsquo;s why&hellip;<br/><br/>The accompanying wine-tasting guides provide all of the pertinent observations in wine-tasting.  The players&rsquo; challenge is to accurately match the observations of the wine you are tasting with the ones listed in the guides.  Alongside each observation you will find the interpretations or answers.  For example, if you observe a red wine with a ruby shade and a brick reflection, the interpretation will be a &ldquo;2- to 5-year old&rdquo; wine.  A Champagne or sparkling wine with small and fast bubbles is a &ldquo;quality sparkling wine.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Bacchanales was developed for wine-lovers of all levels, allowing participants to improve and perfect their knowledge in wine-tasting with each round.  On average, 80 percent of all people who have no prior wine experience can answer 3 out of 5 questions accurately.  In just one round, participants will become true connoisseurs, discovering the many secrets of wine-tasting.<br/><br/>Variant:<br/>If your friends are Boardgame Geeks rather than wine-lovers, you can always forgo a regular game of Bacchanales to play a game of &ldquo;Scent Identity.&rdquo;  This variant using olfactory memory is original and very instructive: Randomly select 10 or 12 of the aroma vials (a greater number makes the game a little long and difficult). On a sheet of paper, draw a corresponding number of circles.  Label the circles with the names of the selected aromas.  Mix the aroma vials.  Set a time limit and have each player attempt to place the correct vial on the correct name!<br/><br/>"}, "18695": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic124605.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"428": {"name": "Dan Verssen"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2005", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"20020": "Mike Anderson"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"102": {"name": "Decision Games (I)"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic124605_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"21319": "2005 Charles S.

The result is a game that features dynamic, flowing movement rather than the same moves broken down into small increments as in standard measured movement games.<br/><br/>Les Grognards 2nd edition features completely new material, incorporating 5 sets of rules (Company scale, Battalion scale, Grand Tactical scale, Horizon Movement Battalion scale, Horizon Movement Grand Tactical scale) and 37 different army lists.  The new lists allow the  unique characteristics of a wide variety of  armies to be represented on the tabletop.

The Grand Tactical game uses the infantry regiment as the standard infantry game unit - allowing players to command Corps on the tabletop.  The variety of wars, battles, and skirmishes throughout the period covered by Hallowed Ground, 2nd Edition requires rules that can cover engagements of all sizes.

The different game scales allow for a wide variety of scenarios, game sizes, and game types.<br/><br/>The Game Scale Rules section includes unique rules for each of the three scale games included in the The Blitzkrieg game supplement (Squad, Platoon, and Battalion).  Each game scale has its own Weapon Adjustment Table, game play reference sheet, quick rating BDV Tables, and organizational information.<br/><br/>This allows a gamers to play everything from a vicious, house-to-house skirmish combat to a multi-division, multi-day battle on the plains of Russia.  The movement, combat, and morale sections of the rules were deliberately developed to fit the &quot;zoom&quot; concept mentioned in the original Piquet rules.  By using a few unique rules, and different troop ratings, a gamer can easily move between the three scales.  The basic rule mechanics are the same, only the details change.  The Squad scale game is new with this version of the rules.  It allows for large skirmish actions, instead of the small, highly individually personalized game typical of skirmish rules.  The Squad game allows skirmish detail in games with a platoon or more of infantry on a side.   The detail players enjoy in skirmish games is still there, but it is imbedded in the game system.  As an example, it would be very easy to just add rules to the basic rule skeleton to handle unique cases.  Consider armor in a skirmish game.   Obviously, there is a difference in the combat readiness of a tank that is buttoned up compared to one which is just moving down a road.  The Squad game easily handles this difference by requiring that vehicles be in a declared status - either march or deployed.  March status indicates a tank or vehicle that is not combat ready, but is primarily intent on moving rapidly.  Deployed status indicates a tank or vehicles that is tactically aware prepared for the uncertainties of the battlefield.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Piquet<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "name": "Piquet: Point of Attack II \u2013 The Blitzkrieg", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "average": "6.94444", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "9", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "expands": {"18704": {"name": "Piquet"}}, "age": "12"}, "18711": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic301761.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"5654": {"name": "Mark Dudley"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2004", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamepublisher": {"4248": {"name": "Piquet, Inc."}}, "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic301761_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "Anchor of Faith warfare in the seventeenth century.  At the beginning of the seventeenth century armies deployed in large units comprising many thousands of men. Firepower, while important, was still subordinate to shock of contact and the use of pole arm weapons. The period can be characterized: - The introduction of smaller formations, reduction in the use of pike and increased reliance on firepower and the development of linear tactics. Anchor of Faith allows the gamer to recreate the battles and tactics of this colorful period.<br/><br/>Anchor of Faith covers warfare in Europe and the fringe nations in the Middle East and Asia. The supplement introduces new rule mechanisms, formation types and army generation tables particular to the period 1600 to 1690. It combines the main rules that allow battles to be played at a regimental scale, and a sub set of rules, the Twelve Apostles, for fighting smaller actions with units typically representing a few companies of infantry or troops of cavalry. The latter being particularly useful for fighting large English Civil War skirmishes.<br/><br/>Anchor of Faith includes a range of new formations definitions including tercios, Swedish brigade, deep line, caracole cavalry, commanded shot, galloper cavalry and war wagons. New period rule mechanisms are introduced to mirror both the abilities and shortcomings of the troops of this era. New rules include revised pursuit rules, morale points by command and new fire rules to reflect the low effect of musketry and the importance of  &lsquo;push of pike&rsquo; in deciding the outcome of engagements.

The Army commander now plays a more pivotal role in the command and control of a Corps.  These formations no longer move whenever or wherever they wish.    A D12 is now the basis for all initiative rolls, which effectively eliminates the need for phases, as well as mitigates the wild swings in initiative.    The Sequence decks have been radically altered. Now there are Action cards, by type of unit [e.g. Infantry Action card], whereby there is much greater flexibility in actions taken by units.  Also, the basic Sequence deck is now made up of 20 cards, instead of 28.  The combat system is based primarily on Target type, so there are fewer modifiers to calculate. The basic concept of &ldquo;chipping&rdquo; within the morale system is intact, yet there is no need to keep track of morale chips. Unit / sub unit designations are determined by numbers of men and not by regiment.  Players determine the size and make up of a unit, thereby effectively tailoring each Command Group to a particular situation or task.  These are but a few of the changes that have been made. <br/>It is hoped that this new edition will keep the flavor and excitement of the original, while improving the mechanics, which will give a more fluid, less static feel to the game.

King Shao fled Ying seeking refuge and asylum across the borders while Sun Tzu remained the master of strategy and tactics.<br/><br/>In Sun Tzu, a.k.a.

Each turn players play cards to specific provinces, then reveal them individually by province. Armies are added or removed from the province depending on who played the higher valued card or who played a special card. Some cards can only be used once, so playing the card at the correct time is critical to a winning strategy. The game has a feel of &quot;tug-of-war&quot; as the scoring marker starts in the middle of the scoring scale and the players attempt to move the marker to their side of the track.

In his brief career, he catapulted Sweden to the forefront of European power politics. This volume sets it focus on the rise and climax of Gustav Adolf's military system.<br/><br/>The series began with the English Civil War in This Accursed Civil War, then covered the Swedish army after Gustav Adolf in Sweden Fights On, then looked at the rise of the French in the Thirty Years War in Under the Lily Banners. In this volume the Swedish face the tough Polish cavalry, lance equipped winged Husars and Cossacks. The Swedish-style brigades also take on the unbeaten Tilly at the head of the allied Catholic League and Imperial armies. Finally, Wallenstein, with a resurgent Imperial army, mastered the art of drawing out the Swedes to attack on ground of his choosing.<br/><br/>In each battle included in Gustav Adolf the Great: With God and Victorious Arms, armies are divided into several wings. Each has a commander and an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Victory goes to the player who can coordinate the actions of his wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry battalions or brigades, cavalry regiments and artillery batteries. Rules include Cavalry Charges, Cavalry Pistols for skirmishing or for close combat, and artillery grazing fire. Play is highly interactive and most battles can be played through in one sitting. The battles included in Gustav Adolf the Great: With God and Victorious Arms are:<br/><br/>Dirschau 1627 - The Prussian campaign that started in 1626, Gustav Adolf had finally brought the Poles to the field and defeated them in battle at Gniew a month before, skillfully using terrain to offset the powerful Polish Hussars. Again the King faced the Polish General Koniecpolski and sought to the same again.<br/><br/>Breitenfeld 1631 - The most famous battle of the Thirty Years War<br/><br/>Alte Veste 1632 - The late summer saw the Swedish besieged by Wallenstein at N&uuml;rnberg.<br/><br/>L&uuml;tzen 1632 - Southeast of Leipzig the Swedes caught up to the Imperial main body. Wallenstein's army had detached two corps and was serious danger. He fortified a position at L&uuml;tzen. King Gustav Adolf's final battle.<br/><br/>Honigfelde / Trzciano 1629 - &quot;I've never had a hotter bath!&quot; exclaimed Gustav II Adolf upon his return. Very nearly captured while trying to extricate his army from a Polish and Imperial trap, this great cavalry battle showed the Poles were to be treated with respect. Rheingraf Otto Ludwig's German cavalry attacked the advancing Poles and was drawn into a pincer. Gustav Adolf rushed forward to save the impetuous Rheingraf. Koniecpolski showed his cunning. The Imperial contingent joined the fray and sent the Swedes falling back. The Imperial commander, von Arnim, would take the field with Gustav Adolf at Breitenfeld two years later.<br/><br/>Components: <br/>3 Full-color countersheets<br/>Two 22&quot;x34&quot; back-printed maps <br/>Rulebook <br/>Scenario/Playbook<br/>2 11x17&quot; Player Aid Cards<br/><br/>Nominee for the 2006 Charles S.

It will allow gamers to replay not only the first three Crusades - the only 3 that focused on what we call The Middle East - but with scenarios that range from a 7-player version of the 1st Crusade to a 3rd Crusade scenario that supposes Frederick Barbarossa didn't drown in Turkey and his immense army reached the Kingdom of Jerusalem pretty much intact.<br/><br/>Onward Christian Soldiers uses numerous innovative mechanics, including: <br/><br/>    an Activation system that allows players to choose which leaders/armies they want to use most in a given turn, but not know when they will be available for such use.<br/>    a Movement system with no Movement Allowances or Costs, but a heavy emphasis on Attrition and the ability of commanders to &quot;keep going&quot;. Shop 'til ya Drop . . . <br/>    Combat mechanics that put a major, detailed emphasis on sieges and ravaging the surrounding areas, but still allow for the predilections of the various armies in field battles (such as the famous Frankish Heavy Cavalry Charge), as well as the abilities of their commanders . . . men like the great initial Crusaders, such as Raymond, Bohemond, Godfrey and Tancred, King Louis VII of France (and his troublesome wife, the famous Eleanor of Aquitaine), Frederick Barbarossa (if he stays away from the pool), the dangerous Nur ad-Din, the magnificent Saladin, and the one Christian the Muslims feared more than anyone, Richard Lionheart.<br/>    Movement and attrition go hand in hand in this game. Leaders may move as far as they want<br/>    The game uses three sets of cards (110 cards total). Each of the four Crusader factions -- Northern Franks, Southern Franks, Sicilian Normans, Germans -- and three Muslim factions -- Northern Syrians, Southern Syrians, Mosul Turks -- has three or four Leader cards, which the players secretly &quot;purchase&quot; at the beginning of the Game-Turn to create the Activation Deck that determines which leader goes next. In addition, there are two Event Decks - one for the Crusaders and one for the Muslims -- through which a variety of random events occur, ranging from taking cities via treachery to suffering added attrition through oppressive heat.<br/>    Normally, each Leader controls armies only from its own faction. However, a simple set of multi-faction rules controls situations in which either side wishes to combine their armies into larger forces, mostly for the sake of sieges against major cities. The Siege of Antioch, which usually happens early in the game, often requires such an army. The multi-faction rules particularly come into their own during multi-player games; here you can expect to see players bickering over who controls the combined forces, an important point considering that whoever is in charge when the city falls gains control over the city. If attacked while combined, the players of a multi-faction force have 30 seconds to decide who's in charge: if they don't, they defend using a mediocre formation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>COUNTERS: 876 full color counters<br/>MAP: One 22&quot;x34&quot; full-color map<br/>CARDS: 110 Cards<br/>OTHER:<br/><br/>     Two six-sided dice<br/>     First Crusade Rule book<br/>     Second and Third Crusade Rule book<br/>     Playbook<br/>     4 Player Aid cards <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>DESIGNER Richard Berg<br/>DEVELOPER Neil Randall<br/>ART DIRECTOR Rodger B.

Both seek to establish control over the country and of its economic structures. They seek not only to defeat their opponents in battle but also to seize control of the local government of England and Wales.<br/><br/>The game is based on We the People, Mark Herman's ingenious game on a later rebellion. As the organization of armies and states was often desultory, the cards do not provide a wide range of choices (as in Paths of Glory). The players in Unhappy King Charles! must make do with what they have. The three decks of cards - Early(1642-1643), Middle(1644) and Late (1645)- have been developed to give the correct feel for the early, middle and late war, based on storyboarding techniques. As befits a Civil War, there is treachery, bravery and stupidity in the events on the cards.<br/><br/>Unhappy King Charles! is played over eleven turns, each representing about four months. Brigades of troops are used to form Armies (defined Rule 3) or garrisons of fortresses (Rule 13). Only unled Brigades are on the map; the others are placed on the box of their General on the Command Displays. Generals move on the maps.<br/><br/>The Armies of Unhappy King Charles! are temporary massings of troops that have as much to do with feudal armies as modern revolutionaries. With inadequate supply and poor equipment it is not surprising that these armies suffer from continual desertion; and in using them you are going to have to ensure they wander the map collecting fresh recruits. Armies can be over 30,000 for a vital siege or battle or 3,000 tough cavalry under Prince Rupert or Black Tom Fairfax.<br/><br/>Movement activations are initiated via a numbered Ops Card, as in We the People, and are based on Army size. The smaller the Army the faster it can move. Movement across the map is by means of Areas joined by movement lines. Control of areas can change during movement if movement points are spent. Non-moving Armies can attempt interception, placing themselves in the path of the moving Army to cause Battle.<br/><br/>The game's basic combat unit is the Brigade, which comes in two types: Veterans (value 2) and militia (value 1). Usually militia units must be recruited before veterans of that Region. Each Region's Areas and Brigades use the same basic colour system. Fresh Brigades are received by Recruitment, which is usually limited to the unit's region of origin. Brigades lost in combat are not available for recruitment (though some Event Cards can bring them back); other losses are available.<br/><br/>Leader counters are either Generals (with a Strategic and Battle Rating) or Local Notables (Governors of fortresses). Generals can be Field Generals (who operate everywhere) or Regional Generals who can suffer disadvantages when outside their Region. Generals cannot transfer Brigades to other Generals (unless Event Cards require), Brigades remain with their original General until death, dispersal or desertion takes them. Local Notables can transfer Brigades to other friendly Generals.<br/><br/>Battles use the Combat Value of Brigades, General's Battle Ratings and Combat Cards to resolve combat. But before any Battle is fought one side can try to Evade (leave the Area) or Disperse (remove itself before combat). Losses in combat are not available for recruitment. Drawn and Decisive Victories will kill Veteran Brigades (if there are any) first. The loser must retreat and can suffer further losses if he retreats through enemy PC Markers. Major and Decisive Victories earn extra Cards.<br/><br/>Fortresses cover a wide range of locations. They are ranked by class and must be forced to Surrender by Siege or Event Card. Siege requires the attention of an Army for some time (most Fortresses will require more than one activation to capture). If attacked during that time the besieger can have to abandon the Siege. Assaults can be attempted (at a cost in losses).<br/><br/>The game can be won by an Automatic Victory, by one side failing to control enough Areas, or at the end of the eleventh turn.<br/><br/>For those players who like some counter-factuals a pack of would-be events is provided. Now players can use Dutch squadrons to blockade the King, summon the Duke of Lorraine, or cause a rising in London. As an Optional Rule, four events are drawn each game and shuffled into the middle and late decks.<br/><br/>Components<br/><br/>     110 Cards<br/>     One 34&quot; x 22&quot; colour paper game map<br/>     Two full-color counter sheets<br/>     One 28 Page Rulebook<br/>     One 24 page Playbook<br/>     Two 11' x 8.5' Player Aid Cards<br/>     Two Six-sided dice<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Cover artwork inspired by Sir Anthony van Dyck (1599-1641)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"23861": "First edition"}, "average": "7.66821", "name": "Unhappy King Charles!", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2018": "Campaign / Battle Card Driven"}, "age": "0", "usersrated": "629", "boardgameaccessory": {"199496": "Unhappy King Charles!: Mounted Mapboard"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"9793": "Age of Kings"}}, "18749": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic148439.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"135": {"name": "Richard H.

Three officers begin play in the garrison, and fifty attackers begin play on all the remaining points of the board. Officers can move in any direction along any lines and jump over attackers to remove them from the board; attackers move only along vertical or diagonal lines towards the garrison and cannot capture officers, but instead merely try to swarm the garrison. To win, the attackers must occupy every point in the garrison, while the officers must capture enough attackers to make such occupation impossible.<br/><br/>This game has been known in English-speaking countries by a number of names, including Officers and Sepoys, The Royal Garrison, The Three Guardsmen, The Three Musketeers, Yellow Peril, and Bataan: The Battle of the Philippines!.

The box measures 19 1/8&quot; by 9 5/8&quot; by 1 3/4&quot;.  It is finished in a diagonal woven texture in tan with some blue-gray highlighting.  In the upper left corner of the lid is a glued-on label.  The label depicts an oasis with several palm trees, green grass, a pool of water, and several people, one seated on a camel.<br/><br/>The label reads: &quot;Game of OASIS (trade mark) The Romance of the Promised Land Copyright MCMXXXVII by Milton Bradley Co. Springfield Mass. Made in U.S.A.  In the lower left of the label is the number 4029.<br/><br/>The mounted board measures 18 1/2&quot; by 18 1/4&quot;.  The board features a light-blue background.  In the center is a round map of Palestine locating several cities, some settlements, and taking pains to point out a single &quot;Electric Works.&quot;<br/><br/>A large circle fills most of the board.  This circle is divided into three concentric rings with spaces, most of which are illustrated with detailed drawings of buildings, historic sites and other features of Palestine.<br/><br/>These spaces are divided into one yellow, one pink, and one green zone, divided by three equidistant &quot;spokes&quot; in blue.  One of these spokes depicts the Mediterranean coast with several steamers approaching Haifa and Tel Aviv (this spoke is labeled &quot;START&quot;).<br/><br/>A second spoke is labeled &quot;Yarkon River,&quot; and the third, &quot;Jordan River.&quot;  Each colored zone has three blank white spaces, one in each of the three rings.  The yellow and pink zones each have twelve colored spaces, while the green zone has fifteen.<br/><br/>Some examples of these zones (with drawings) include &quot;Jaffa Namal, Pay 5 sh Mehes;&quot; &quot;Hotel--300 sh;&quot;  &quot;Rachel's Tomb--Visit;&quot;  &quot;Keren Kayemeth--Land Free--100 sh Dev.;&quot; &quot;Factory Site--100 sh -- 300 sh Dev.;&quot; &quot;Hulleh Swamps -- Contribute;&quot; &quot;Bialik's Home--Contribute Writer's Fund 5 sh;&quot;  &quot;Herzl Forest--Plant Trees;&quot; &quot;Wailing Wall--Visit;&quot; &quot;Arab Land--40sh--100 sh Dev.;&quot; &quot;Hebrew University--Scholarship 50 sh;&quot; &quot;Hadassah Hospital--Contribute.&quot;  There are many more.<br/><br/>The game includes four wooden pawns in green, orange, red, and white.  The game also uses small dreidels, with green, orange, red, and white shafts, in place of dice.  A very large number of die-cut card &quot;shekels&quot; in denominations 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 are included, along with a set of 32 very sturdy green cards with text on one side (blank on back).  These cards are as heavy as the old green &quot;flags&quot; that came with Tinkertoys fifty years ago.<br/><br/>Some examples of card texts: &quot;If you have paid your dues and are a member of the HISTADRUTH (Federation of Labor) you may go to the Hadassah Hospital and receive Medical Care free of charge.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This is the eve of Pesah (Passover).  Cleanse your home of Hometz (Leaven) and move 5 spaces forward.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This is the 13th day of Adar which commemorates the Yahrzeit (the anniversary of the death) of Joseph Trumpeldor.  Go to Tel Hai and visit the grave of this great national hero who sacrificed his life defending Jewish settlements in Palestine.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Go to Petah Tikvah to supervise a cooperative Pardess (orange grove).  Collect 5 SH'KOLIM from each OLEH.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Go to Jerusalem to the Immigration Dept. to obtain certificates for Halutzim (Pioneers) who wish to settle in Palestine.&quot;<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this otherwise well-preserved game was found with no rules.  Attempts to find rules through the Milton Bradley rules site, and generally on the Internet, have proven unsuccessful.

Each campaign takes place in a different era, so your weapon options change with each campaign.<br/><br/>A major part of the game is mission planning. You get to decide how your Hornets are to be armed, and which pilots are best for the mission based on their Air-to-Air and Air-to-Ground skills.<br/><br/>Missions are quickly resolved with the priority placed on speed and realism. Hornet Leader II has retained all the key decision-making aspects of the original game, while greatly streamlining the game mechanics.<br/><br/>While performing each mission, you get to decide how your pilots engage the enemy Bandits, SAMs, and AAA Sites. This makes for some tough choices, the more suppression munitions, you haul to the target, the safer your pilots will be, but the less likely you are to destroy the target.<br/><br/>Available in two formats:<br/><br/>- Virtual Tabletop Game using the Vassal Engine<br/>- PDF files to download and print.<br/><br/>(<a target='_blank' href='http://www.dvg.com/.sc/ms/dd/Vassal%5E2FPDF%20Games/3/Hornet%20Leader%20II' rel='nofollow'>http://www.dvg.com/.sc/ms/dd/Vassal%5E2FPDF%20Games/3/Hornet...</a>)<br/><br/>Hornet Leader II was a nominee in the Charles S.

A cardboard figure is set up for each participating character in the duel. The attacker shoots with the dart pistol towards the targets with as many darts as the difference between the totals rolled. If he shoots every opposing character, he wins. Then the defender shoots with the same number of darts. This exchange continues until one of the player has shot down all the targets of the other.

To show a card a player takes a card out of is hand and places it on the table in front of him, it still belongs to him.  To activate, take a show card and place it in the center of the table, which now belongs to all.  To Combine, a player may take one card from his hand and combine it with one of his show cards, combine two of his show cards, combine one of his show cards with an active card, or two active cards.  Only cards whose colors are one color apart on the color wheel may be combined.  For example red and blue makes magenta, and blue and cyan makes green.  To Take cards, a player takes one of his show cards (or a combination as if it were the combined color) and an active card, (or combination) and puts them aside for scoring at the end of the round.  To take, the colors must be exactly opposite on the color wheel, for example a blue show card (or magenta, cyan combination) takes yellow active card (or red, green combination).<br/><br/>Advanced rules allow combining more than two cards to make combinations, thus yellow combined with a blue/red combination (as if it were magenta) makes red.<br/><br/>Although the number of players is stated as 2 to 6, there is no five player version.

Drawing on his own experience with Chess and Xiang-Qi, Demian came up with Congo in just over an hour's time.

Next is a crocodile that can move and capture by stepping one space in any direction or may race all the way to the river on an open file or may swim horizontally within the river along its entire unobstructed length. Next comes an elephant that moves and captures by jumping one or two squares orthogonally. Next is the lion, then another elephant. Next is a monkey that moves by stepping one space in any direction or captures (possibly repeatedly) by jumping over pieces by a short leap (i.e., the monkey's capturing movement is like the piece movement in Halma, but with immediate capture). Last comes the giraffe, which can jump one or two steps in any direction or capture by jumping onto pieces two spaces away in any direction. Like animals on opposing sides are lined up opposite their counterparts.<br/><br/>The second rank on each side is filled with un-promoted pawns that move and capture by stepping one space straight or diagonally forward, and may (but only from across the river) also retreat one or two spaces straight backward without capture. Pawns promote to a super-pawn upon reaching the last rank, and may additionally move and capture one space horizontally or retreat one or two spaces diagonally backward from any space on the board.

The figure scale is 1:20.<br/><br/>Over the years I have used various sets of Napoleonic wargames rules &ndash; some good, others too complicated or simply not &quot;Napoleonic&quot;. Most however, were split into two very separate camps - those aimed at battalion level and those aimed at army level with little or no middle ground between the two. General de Brigade was designed to combine the appeal of battalion based games with the most important aspects of command and control from army level games. It was important therefore to base the game at the correct level within the military structure in order to achieve this. The division seemed the most suitable level.<br/><br/>When players field a division they are in command of a number of brigades and it is to this level that most wargamers are suited. This is because after spending hours researching and painting our armies we want to maneuver each and every unit, overseeing their every volley, melee and morale test, At brigade level this is exactly what is expected of the commander &ndash; he would be concerned with deployment, formation and when to fire &ndash; here formations such as column or line do matter! However the use of brigades and brigade orders introduces a command and control factor that limits the 'nippy little battalion' syndrome and restricts the wargamer from doing whatever he wants with any unit whenever it suits him.<br/><br/>General de Brigade allows wargamers the freedom to command and maneuver each battalion or squadron but also includes higher command decisions such as brigade objectives, the timing of assaults and the deployment of reserves.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"181601": "Partizan Press Deluxe Edition"}, "name": "General de Brigade", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2070": "Simulation"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "21", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "average": "7.66667"}, "18818": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic366650.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"5685": {"name": "David Brown"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1999", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": {"2663": {"name": "Partizan Press"}}, "maxplaytime": "180", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic366650_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "The first volume of historical Napoleonic scenarios for any system but mainly for the more manageable refights that General de Brigade is becoming renowned for.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "name": "Napoleonic Scenarios Volume 1", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2070": "Simulation"}, "average": "5.75", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "4", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "expands": {"18817": {"name": "General de Brigade"}}, "age": "12"}, "18819": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic419546.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"5685": {"name": "David Brown"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2002", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": {"2663": {"name": "Partizan Press"}}, "maxplaytime": "180", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic419546_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "The second volume of historical Napoleonic scenarios for any system but mainly for the more manageable refights that General de Brigade is becoming renowned for.<br/><br/>It contains the following ten scenarios:<br/><br/><br/>     Elchingen 1805<br/>     Saalfeld 1806<br/>     Maida 1806<br/>     Teugen-Hausen 1809<br/>     Essling 1809<br/>     Brunswick 1809<br/>     Sabugal 1811<br/>     Arroyo Molinos 1811<br/>     Dolitz &amp; Probstheyda &ndash; Leipzig 1813<br/>     Plancenoit 1815.<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "name": "Napoleonic Scenarios Volume 2", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2070": "Simulation"}, "average": "5.75", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "4", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "expands": {"18817": {"name": "General de Brigade"}}, "age": "12"}, "18820": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Klik-Ball", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "1930", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "3", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic84865_t.jpg", "average": "5.75", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3320": {"name": "(Unknown)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic84865.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"113067": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "A simple dexterity game where players hit their ball up one of three inclined tracks with a small cue.

Four of the railroads have fifteen shares of stock, a treasury card, ten railroad tracks, and several blocks. The fifth railroad, Credit Mobilier, only has the stock and treasury card.

The player will then choose to lay track (which adds to the Credit Mobilier treasury), move freight (which may add to the treasury of the railroad that owns the freight and traversed upon track), buy stock of one railroad (if available) for one dollar each, or pay dividends to the owners of the shares of one company.<br/><br/>A player&rsquo;s options are limited to which colors are rolled on the dice.

Bright summer days filled with games of tag and attempts to flock closer to Roger, the Heartthrob Ram? But, Watch Out! The shearer wants to drag you away from all the fun and games!<br/><br/>In Shear Panic, ewe maneuver your ewes to score points, playing tag, standing close to Roger, or trying to avoid the shearing scissors! Will your brave sheep score the most points, or will it be &quot;Off with the wool&quot; for ewe?&quot;<br/><br/>The game includes eleven small figurines (which are somewhat fragile): Two each of four different colors, one black, one 'Roger', and one 'Shearer'. Also included are four player mats in different colors; a timing/scoring mat; 48 mutton buttons in four colors; four scoring markers; one flock marker; and two special six-sided dice.<br/><br/>There are two separate play areas: The one where the flock of sheep figurines are clustered; and the combination timing/scoring mat. (The timing mat is two-sided for 3 or 4 players.) Actions by the players each turn cause the timing marker to move faster or slower through each of the four fields, and the scoring is different in each field.<br/><br/>Field 1 is Team Tag. Players score higher for keeping their sheep closer together. Field 2 is Roger&rsquo;s Field, where players score more the closer they are to Roger (the ram). Field 3 is Black Sheep Tag, and players score higher the closer they are to the black sheep. Field 4 is the Shear Panic Field, and the row of sheep closest to the shearer figure are eliminated each turn, while the remainder are scored individually. The timing marker indicates which Field the sheep are currently &ldquo;in&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Players have a total of twelve actions they may take during the course of the game, and as each one is used, a &ldquo;mutton button&rdquo; is placed over it, eliminating it from future use. Also, the more powerful the action, the farther (faster) the timing marker will move. If the timing marker lands on a red spot, the active player executes a free &ldquo;lamb slam&rdquo; by rolling the Panic Die and moving a sheep of the color rolled one space in any direction. If the Panic Die rolls white, the entire flock does a &ldquo;ewe turn&rdquo; ninety degrees in a direction of the active player&rsquo;s choice.<br/><br/>Since all the player mats are visible to everyone, players need to keep an eye on what moves are still available to their opponents.<br/><br/>The game is intended for three or four players, but rules for a two-player variant are included.<br/><br/>Starting player is the person who most recently was sheared (had their hair cut).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"20884": "999 Games Dutch Edition"}, "average": "6.3989", "name": "Shear Panic", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "10", "usersrated": "3389", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"7481": "Animals: Sheep"}}, "18867": {"boardgamedesigner": {"5694": {"name": "Bruce Alsip"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Canoe", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2003", "usersrated": "63", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic305143_t.jpg", "average": "7.63016", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3559": {"name": "Alsip and Co."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic305143.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"205956": "Alsip and Co.

The British and Spanish monarchs did not reckon with the ambitions of Napoleon III, nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte and Emperor of the French.

From 1862 through 1866, Napoleon III and his puppet Maximilian attempted to forge a Mexican Empire, but after the United States won its Civil War, the threat of an invasion from the North and growing concerns about the ascendancy of the Prussian military in Europe forced Napoleon to withdraw his army from Mexico.

A state which did not back up its policies with troops in this period probably supplied them as mercenaries to those which did.<br/><br/>Central to the causes of conflict were the expansionist ambitions of Louis XIV, King of France, which were opposed by a series of shifting alliances. Towering over the period is the figure of John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, and his close ally Prince Eugene of Savoy.<br/><br/>This is the classic campaigning period. Each year, the armies marched across Europe is a colossal chess game on a board constricted by river barriers and studded with fortresses. These manoeuvres culminated in great set-piece battles, including Marlborough&rsquo;s &lsquo;big four&rsquo;: Blenheim, Ramillies, Oudenarde and Malplaquet.<br/><br/>The War of Spanish Succession has much to recommend it to wargamers; uniforms were colourful (but are simple to paint.) and manoeuvres were bold and forceful. Standing armies were in their relative infancy at this time, and the period saw the founding of traditions which were to last the centuries.<br/><br/>Polemos War of Spanish Succession is specifically aimed at enabling the wargamer to fight large scale actions; actual battles, rather than small scale skirmishes. Systems for firing, melee and morale are straightforward and easy to learn, but allow your troops to emulate the tactics used by their historical counterparts. For instance, troops using the platoon firing system have improved close range factors, while others using fire by ranks are allowed to be more aggressive.<br/><br/>The basic playing piece in Polemos is the Base. An army consists of a number of bases, organised into Brigades and Commands, either to an historical model or by the use of army lists. The size of armies in this period varied enormously; in Polemos WoSS, a general&rsquo;s command can be from eight to 15 bases, but an army can comprise anything from two commands upwards.<br/><br/>Polemos War of Spanish Succession is designed to not only give the feel of command in the period, but also to give something of the look. The actual number or composition of figures on a base is unimportant, but it should mount enough figures to make it look like a real unit of troops. The sight of your lines of steady musketeers or massed cavalry advancing across the table should fill your opponent with awe and trepidation!<br/><br/>"}, "18918": {"boardgamedesigner": {"5705": {"name": "Nick Dorrell"}}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Polemos: Great Northern War", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2070": "Simulation"}, "yearpublished": "2005", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": {"20529": "Polemos"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic86495_t.jpg", "average": "6.8", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4297": {"name": "Baccus 6mm Ltd."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic86495.jpg", "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"2726": {"name": "Age of Reason"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>The early years of the eighteenth century were a time of great, and long lasting, changes in Eastern Europe.

While Poland-Lithuania started on the path that would lead to extinction later in the century. It saw two medium sized powers, Denmark and Saxony, fail in their bid to gain, or regain, &lsquo;Great&rsquo; powers status. It saw two powers rise; for Brandenburg-Prussia it was an important stepping stone to Great power status later in the century. While for Russia went from being &lsquo;an obscure barbarous nation&rsquo; to a Great power thanks to its victories<br/><br/>Polemos: Great Northern War is aimed at gaming large scale actions from this time. It is quite possible to stage, play and complete actions in an evening and even the largest action should be relatively easy to play. The emphasis is on the Great Northern War but other actions from this period can also be fought. The wars against the Ottoman Empire, the Polish Civil War and other actions in the period 1695 to 1725 may also be fought. You can be Peter the Great of Russia and face the cream of what was probably the best army in the world of this period &ndash; Charles XII Swedish army. Perhaps instead you could as Peter battle the Ottomans on the river Prut.<br/><br/>The Great Northern War has perhaps not been gamed as much as would be expected for such an important conflict with many interesting battles and armies. To a large extent this is because of the lack of information about the war and its battles. Polemos: GNW will introduce information and army lists that will rectify this. You too will be able to command the combined Saxon, Polish and Russian army at the battle of Kalisz (1706) or re-fight the Polish civil war battle of Koniecpol (1708).<br/><br/>"}, "18919": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Duel Masters: Battle of the Creatures Board Game", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "26", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic126984_t.jpg", "average": "4.51923", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"51": {"name": "Hasbro"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic126984.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"33003": "Milton Bradley edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "From the game box:<br/><br/>You're the duelist as you move around the gameboard in search of the powers of the Five Civilizations.

Players race to move their pieces around the board, delaying their opponent while trying to connect their pieces to the far end of the board marked with their symbol.  Using a familiar (Backgammon type) roll-and-move mechanism, each player attempts to form an orthogonally connected group of their pieces (as in Lines of Action) at the opposite corner of the board from their starting location.  The board is designed with two &quot;walls&quot; that force the players to navigate an &quot;S&quot; type path to reach their goal in the opposite corner.  The board consists of nine subareas, each with a basic direction of forward movement (which is, of course, opposite for the two players).<br/><br/>On their turn, each player rolls two dice (4-sided dice for the 9x9 board, 6-sided dice for the 12x12 board) and uses the resulting numbers to move their pieces.  Pieces may either step directly forwards, or jump over a wall.  If a piece steps directly forwards, then it must step in a straight line a number of spaces equal to the number of pips shown on one of the dice.  If the piece steps onto a single enemy piece, then that enemy piece is pinned (as in Plakoto) until the player moves off.  Players may stack as many pieces as they like onto any point, but cannot move to any point at which the enemy controls a block (a pile of two or more pieces).  Alternatively, a piece may jump over a wall (ignoring the movement restrictions of the moving piece's current sub-area) if that jump lands on a single enemy piece a number of spaces away equal to the number of pips shown on one of the dice.  The enemy piece is captured and removed from the game.  Players cannot jump backwards and cannot cross both walls with the same jump.  Jumping over a wall to capture an enemy piece is a double-edged sword: it allows the piece to push forward quickly by taking a shortcut, but also makes the opponent's task easier as they have one less piece to connect.<br/><br/>After making any move, the same piece may take further steps or jumps, possibly changing direction if the first move resulted in a change in sub-area. If a double is rolled, then the player moves four times using the pip value shown (as in Backgammon).  The player must make a move that uses the maximum possible number of pips.<br/><br/>A player wins by orthogonally connecting all of their remaining pieces to the far end of the board marked with their symbol (not necessarily in a single connected group, but all pieces orthogonally connected to a piece on the goal line).  A player may also win by pinning an opponent's piece on his own starting line.<br/><br/>"}, "18924": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1319376.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"5706": {"name": "Laurent Journaux"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2005", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"41365": "Emmanuel Bouley"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1319376_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Aim: To be the fastest driver on the special stage of the rally.<br/><br/>Principle of the game : The players must go through the different road sections of the special stage made with special cards put on the table at the beginning of the game.

The design combines factual historical detail with educated guesswork to produce an alternative history simulation covering the period from X-Day +1 through X-Day +30. One player acts as the overall commander of the Allied invasion effort; the other takes the role of the leader of the Japanese defense force. The burden of attack is generally on the American, but both players attempt to win by controlling key terrain on the island and destroying opposing forces. A complete game of DF takes from two to four hours to complete and it's suitable for solitaire play.<br/><br/>The approach we've taken here is called, among those who deal regularly with alternative history &ndash; which is itself also known as &quot;virtual history&quot; and &quot;alternative outcome analysis &ndash; the conservation of historical reality. That is, to make the assumptions and results of our simulation as valid as possible, we made the fewest possible changes needed to the historic timeline in order to put our alternative one in place. The basic assumption here, then, is that the Japanese simply refused to surrender after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

A scoring rack (wire with plastic scoring chips) is included in the game.<br/><br/>The game was most notable for its promotion by American actor Don Adams who was well known for his role as a bumbling secret agent in &ldquo;Get Smart&rdquo; on 1960&rsquo;s television.<br/><br/>"}, "18995": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1902": {"name": "Mary Kay Beavers"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "PrimePak", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2004": "Set Collection"}, "yearpublished": "2000", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4665": "Children's Games"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic91119_t.jpg", "average": "4.25", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"544": {"name": "Conceptual Math Media"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic91119.jpg", "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "PrimePak - Four Card Games<br/><br/>Master multiplication, division and factoring skills while having fun playing card games with this unique deck of 171 cards.
