Each piece in this game has a rank that determines the distance it may move, and a directional characteristic which indicates the direction that it may be moved. In this way, each piece represents a vector, having characteristics of both magnitude and direction.<br/><br/>PLAYING SURFACE: Vector Chess is played on a square playing area divided into either 49 or 64 smaller squares of equal size. The squares may be alternately light and dark colored, but it is not necessary. A game played on the board having 49 squares will usually make for a shorter game when compared to a game on the 64 square board.<br/><br/>THE PIECES: Depending upon the type of board used, enough pieces must be used to fill the first two rows of squares on each side of the board, with each piece set facing the opposite side of the board. Only two types of pieces are used in this game: the MAJOR pieces, and the MINOR pieces. The major pieces, which are line up along the first row of the board, have the highest rank and may be moved from one to four spaces along a straight line in the direction that they are pointing. The minor pieces are lined up on the second row of the board, and are identical to the major pieces except that they are shorter and may be moved only one or two spaces in the direction that they are pointing. Each piece in this game maneuvers like a soldier on a battlefield &ndash; it may turn and move to a new position, provided no other piece blocks its path, and it may attack any enemy piece that is directly in its path and within range. The range of movement is the number of spaces that the piece move can move as was previously described.<br/><br/>OBJECT OF THE GAME: The object of the game is to &ldquo;check mate&rdquo; the opposing player by maneuvering pieces into his first row squares until the defending pieces in that row are outnumbered. If the first row squares are empty, only one attacking pieces is required to put the opposing player &ldquo;in check&rdquo;. The defending player must break the check during his next turn as described below, or he will be considered &ldquo;check mated&rdquo;.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS: This game includes 32 round wooden playing pieces in 2 colors that are similar looking to a rook in chess but have a directional arrow in the top. For each player there are 8 'tall' pieces and 8 'short' pieces that otherwise look identical. The board included has a 7x7 grid on a rolled up vinyl board (although the game can also be played on an 8x8 grid - presumably a standard chess board would be suitable)<br/><br/>"}, "106005": {"rpgitemversion": {"120868": "Haunted House"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Haunted House, un juego de rol", "rpgproducer": {"51550": "Melina Grinberg Almir\u00f3n"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1078489.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"11965": "Haunted House"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpggenre": {"158": "Horror"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1078489_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the book:<br/><br/>&quot;UN JUEGO DONDE LAS REGLAS SON EL AMBIENTE<br/><br/>Acabas de entrar en la casa y ya te est&aacute;s arrepintiendo.

Player's goal is to avoid dogs, construction workers, giant bees and similar creatures. The player can fight back by throwing objects back at them, or - most notably - picking walking enemies up from behind and throwing them as projectiles at other obstacles. Stacking thrown objects is often required to get to the end of most levels. The game features a code-based &quot;saving&quot; system, with the codes calculated uniquely for each machine. The game is compatible with almost all CGA, EGA and VGA graphic adapters. In the Game Boy Color version removed the ability to stand on thrown objects, as well as throw enemies. Players could no longer enter through doorways in levels and a new gimmick was added that would cause walls and ladders to appear if you walked on their invisible activation space.

The technology uses computer vision and gesture recognition to process images taken by the camera.

It is the successor to the EyeToy for the PlayStation 2, which was released in 2003.<br/><br/>The peripheral was launched in a bundle with The Eye of Judgment in the United States on October 23, 2007, in Japan and Australia on October 25, 2007 and in Europe on October 26, 2007.<br/><br/>The PlayStation Eye was also released as a stand-alone product in United States, Europe, and Australia. EyeToy designer Richard Marks stated that the EyeToy was used as a model for the rough cost design.<br/><br/>Camera<br/>The PlayStation Eye is capable of capturing standard video with frame rates of 60 hertz at a 640&times;480 pixel resolution, and 120 hertz at 320&times;240 pixels,which is &quot;four times the resolution&quot; and &quot;two times the frame-rate&quot; of the EyeToy, according to Sony.<br/><br/>The PlayStation Eye also has &quot;two times the sensitivity&quot; of the EyeToy, with Sony collaborating with sensor chip partner OmniVision Technologies on a sensor chip design using larger sensor pixels, allowing for more effective low-light operation. Sony states that the PlayStation Eye can produce &quot;reasonable quality video&quot; under the illumination provided by a television set.<br/><br/>The camera features a two-setting adjustable fixed focus zoom lens. Selected manually by rotating the lens barrel, the PlayStation Eye can be set to a 56&deg; field of view (red dot) similar to that of the EyeToy, for close-up framing in chat applications, or a 75&deg; field of view (blue dot) for long shot framing in interactive physical gaming applications.<br/><br/>The PlayStation Eye is capable of outputting video to the console uncompressed, with &quot;no compression artifacts&quot;; or with optional JPEG compression.<br/><br/>Microphone<br/>The PlayStation Eye features a built-in four-capsule microphone array, with which the PlayStation 3 can employ technologies for multi-directional voice location tracking, echo cancellation, and background noise suppression. This allows the peripheral to be used for speech recognition and audio chat in noisy environments without the use of a headset. The PlayStation Eye microphone array operates with each channel processing 16-bit samples at a sampling rate of 48 kilohertz, and a signal-to-noise ratio of 90 decibels.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;PlayStation Eye&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "106065": {"poll": {}, "name": "Kolonix", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1130622_t.jpg", "average": "4.66667", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1130622.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"120961": "Artur Chomka"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "KOLONIX a board game in which colonize the-deal-free squares on the board by placing them in our leading disc (figure).<br/>Figure consists of two basic discs.<br/>Movement of the disc leading to 2-1 (two to one in the front side) is the same as chess horse.

The circuits were accurately depicted as having both sharp and wide turns, thus requiring players to slow down to certain speeds for corners, instead of most arcade-style games, which allowed players to unrealistically take turns flat-out. Gear shifting was also required for three of the cars (and notably for 8 of the 9 levels of the game), and some courses required dozens of gear changes per lap. Tire wear increased as the races went on, and players would be required to pit for tires at least once during each race to remain competitive.<br/>Button assignments were traditional and simple.<br/>&quot;Left&quot; and &quot;Right&quot; were used for steering. These two buttons were tapped singly rather than held down during turns. In cornering, the cars made predetermined angles of curvature depending upon the number of taps.<br/>&quot;Up&quot; and &quot;Down&quot; were used for upshifting and downshifting, respectively.<br/>&quot;A&quot; button and &quot;B&quot; button were used for the accelerator and brake, respectively<br/>Quickly tapping the &quot;A&quot; button during pit stops increased the speed of the pit crew<br/>Simultaneously holding down &quot;A&quot; button and &quot;B&quot; button held the car's speed, aiding the player in cornering<br/>A trick for getting through some of the higher-speed tight turns is to continue to drive straight, flat out into the turn, and lock the brakes as you enter the grass. This causes the car to slide through the grass, and follow the line of the track. Once the car re-enters the track after the turn, you get back on the gas, and keep on racing. It adds an excitingly fun an explorative skill element to the race, as you must time your braking so as to only skid while on the grass, otherwise you decelerate very quickly by braking on the road. It is also challenging to see where this technique aids/hampers your time.<br/>When multiple cars were on the track, the game featured no direct interaction between vehicles. All of the competitors' machines behaved in a ghost-like manner, and could be driven through and occupy the same space as others. Cars were unable to spin others out, and could not directly impede their progress.<br/>Nearly every screen in the entire game featured a short-looped, repeating soundtrack.

It consisted of a keyboard, connecting cables, power supply, soft foot pedals, and software either on 3.5&quot; floppies or a standard, licensed NES/SNES/Genesis cartridge. When connected to the console or computer, a user followed the on-screen notes. Its marketed value was as a tool to teach kids and to play the piano. It provided hundreds of lessons, and was advertised as the perfect adjunct to formal lessons. Due to its prohibitive price ($500) and low sales, the keyboard with all of the original cables together are a rare find. Aside from being released in the United States, the Miracle Keyboard was also released in multiple regions within Europe. The European versions are, however, much harder to find. Some of the NES Miracle keyboards were also later converted for PC use - the Nintendo Seal of Quality on these boards was covered up with a piece of plastic.<br/>Students can learn to play classic piano, rock piano or show tunes. Fun exercises making learning the piano seem less like a chore and more like playing a video game. Instead of using the traditional NES controller, the piano becomes the controller as players hits targets in order to perfect their music skills.<br/>There are two games that students can play to help teach rhyming. The first is called Robo Man where you have to press the correct keys at the right time to create a bridge. If you miss, Robo Man falls and you lose. The second game is a duck shooting game. You have to press the correct keys to shoot the ducks.<br/>The Miracle Piano did not ever generate sounds from the NES hardware; all NES MIDI information was converted into audio by the instrument's built-in ROM and played through the instrument's stereo speakers, allowing the keyboard to be used independently of the console.undefined<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Miracle Piano (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "106073": {"videogame": {"106086": "The World of Lucky Luke"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Lucky Luke: Western Fever", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"120978": "EU PlayStation edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1077815.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2351": "Puzzle"}, "videogamefranchise": {"7763": "Lucky Luke"}, "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2161": "Action Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4433": "PlayStation"}, "usersrated": "0", "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"106086": "The World of Lucky Luke"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1077815_t.jpg", "description": "From the Back Cover<br/><br/>The Indian Sorcerer, Snake Foot, has been taken prisoner by a gang of outlaws.<br/>Lucky Luke, it's a job for you!!!<br/><br/><br/>     A Wil West adventure in full 3-D, for a fun shooting experience with plenty of puzzles to solve.<br/>    Many hidden bonuses like &quot;The Making Of&quot; and a whole wagon-load of other surprises.<br/>     Discover the real story of the Wild West in the manual.<br/><br/><br/>"}, "106074": {"boardgamedesigner": {"51561": {"name": "Jocelyn Boisvert"}}, "average": "5", "poll": {}, "name": "Archipel", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2745041_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"51562": "Marianne Papillon"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"18226": {"name": "Les \u00e9ditions la Morue Verte"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2745041.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"120979": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1097": {"name": "Travel"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "You are tourists racing to be the first one to visit all seven of the islands that comprise the &Icirc;les-de-la-Madeleine.<br/><br/>To do so you collect cards in hand that match one of the three possible current destinations.

It features rules for ascension, sprint, time trial (even a different rule for mountain time trial), and provides mechanism to run a single race.<br/><br/>The board is customisable with the provided little arrows.  It is just a plain 100-field board.Before the race you must decide how long will it be (recommended: 150 to 250 squares long for a one-day race, that is one and a half to two and a half laps) and where you place the different mountains and sprints.<br/><br/>What is puzzling is that you have to remember (and possibly write down) in which lap are placed the mountains. In effect, it is recommended to have three climbs during the race, and each climb takes place in a different lap. The same applies to special sprints. So you end up with a board with too many arrow pointing at mountains and sprints that might or might not be there.<br/>We have six national teams  of 5 riders each, and every rider has different abilities which affect the probability of having a good throw on a given type of road. As you can see in the team cards, riders have values for flat road (LL = &quot;llano&quot;), mountain (M), sprint (S), time trial (CR = &quot;contra reloj&quot;) and mountain time trial (CRM).<br/><br/>On an even closer look, you will guess that good values is the lower one (9) for flat roads (LL) and the higher for mountains sprints and time trials. This is because in flat road riders throw two dice and they have an extra throw if they match their number on the team card (and of course, it is more probable to throw 9 than 12 with two dice, though when you get an extra throw after a double sic, you really advance a lot)<br/><br/>The mountain rule is quite strange. You still throw two dice, but you only advance the value of the blue one. The red dice is just added to the blue to see if you match the number on the card and you have an extra throw.<br/><br/>Similar rules apply to sprint and time trial. Just roll and move. No decisions to be taken. The only strategic issue in the game is the demarrage card. One is given to each player, to be used only once during the race, and giving you an extra throw for one rider. <br/>The game is intended to run a full season, so we have special maillots (yellow, green and rainbow jerseis) medals and a trophy, and rules to decide how many points is worth a given race. <br/><br/><br/>"}, "106076": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Monster Truck Rally", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"136565": "JP Famicom edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2456": "Driving"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2154": "Racing"}, "videogameplatform": {"4430": "NES"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Gear-grinding, teeth-jarring excitement -- it's STADIUM MUD BUGGIES!

The player controls a boxer as he boxes his way to the top, earning purse money along the way, progressing up the world rankings until fighting Barry McGuigan himself. A players can customize his boxer by style, race, hair and shorts. The player could also choose his next opponent, either at the same ranking, below or above, each with their own lead up time to the fight. The longer the player had until the fight the more time could be spent in the gym allocating points to the following activities: Weights, sparring, road work, heavy bag or light bag. Each of these activities had a benefit on the boxers stamina, strength and endurance. Roadwork for example helped with endurance, whilst weights and heavy bag helped with strength. Before deciding which opponent to fight a summary is shown of each detailing his attributes. Looking at these the player can then decide if he wishes to take the opponent on. Picking an opponent who is above you in the rankings will progress you quicker up the rankings and earn you more money, however this is risky as they are stronger fighters. Some opponents could be beaten quite quickly, whilst others required several rounds of boxing to defeat. Whilst boxing the following moves can be employed: Cross, block, body punch, jab, hook and uppercut.

The Psychosphere is appropriately named, as the various worlds resemble the thoughts and actions that have occurred upon Earth during its history. The Spirits then embarked upon the construction of massive floating city-ships called Frames, which could house hundreds of thousands of people for an indefinite period of time. With the Frames completed, the Spirits sent them forth into the Psychosphere with the intent to lead their people to the Promised Land, leaving Earth behind forever.<br/><br/>Within each of the Frames, the Spirits formed Spirit Councils which exercised absolute authority in all matters relating to the Frame. The general populous were kept sedate and forced into a ritualistic spiritualism to control their minds, for it was soon discovered that the Psychosphere reacted to negative emotions; causing creatures known as Scourge to erupt out of the very ground and attack the Frames. Eventually, some of the citizens of the Frames began to revolt against the rule of the Spirit Council, and the Frames began to separate into three factions: the Exodus who continued to follow the guidance of the Spirits and seek the Promised Land, the Harkback who reject the rule of the Spirits and seek to return to Earth, and the Empire who reject the Spirits, the idea of the Promised Land, and Earth, seeking to establish a cybernetic Human empire within the Psychosphere itself.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, the various factions come into contact, and eventually combat, with one another's Frames and with the Scourge.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Perimeter (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "106106": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Track Attack", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"121022": "Atari 8-bit family 5 1/4\" floppy disk"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2280": "Crime"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2314": "Arcade"}, "videogameplatform": {"4940": "Atari 8-bit family"}, "poll": {}, "description": "from the back of the box<br/><br/>This program teaches you how to rob trains.<br/><br/>Setting: A small railroad yard somewhere between Elizabeth, New Jersey and Johannesburg.

We're introduced to Lee from the dog's perspective after waking up to find his owner sleepwalking through his bedroom window. Ralph leaps after him and the player then takes control of what happens next. Throughout the game Lee will relentlessly walk in the direction he is facing, the problem is there are objects and pitfalls in his path that can ultimately wake him up or even kill him. The player can monitor Lee's sleep level with a bar at the top of the screen. If the bar reaches zero, Lee wakes up and the player loses a life. If this happens three (or five depending on settings) times the game is lost. The player controls Ralph the dog in order to manipulate either Lee, or the objects he is likely to walk into, to see him safely to the end of a level. The frequency of these pitfalls increases as each level progresses and, as it does, the player has to spend more time strategically neutralising threats, far in advance of Lee's actual position in the level. Although it is possible for Lee to die, resulting in a loss of life and restart of the level for the player, Ralph is invincible, surviving otherwise fatal incidents with comedic effect. If all the levels are successfully completed Lee finally returns to his bed and crawls back in.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleepwalker_%28video_game%29,&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleepwalker_%28video_game%29,&q...</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "106110": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Tyrant", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"121030": "Web Browser edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1196410.png", "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "5", "average": "6.7", "videogamegenre": {"2158": "Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"5084": "Web Browser"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1196410_t.png", "description": "Online CCG with interactive battles and a storyline!

War had been waged in Bavaria against the Prussians, Catalonia against the Spaniards, under the great pyramids against the relentless Turk and even at New Orleans against those upstart Americans. Now new challengers have arisen and a completely foreign army is arrayed across the battlefield. The Tri-Color fluttered in the breeze as rocket shells burst in the air. A new type of warfare was about to be unleashed.<br/><br/>Manoeuvre: Distant Lands is an expansion for Manoeuvre. Four new armies are included to allow you to bring the fight from the frozen north to the sub-continent and the mythic east. Included in this set are counters and cards for Sweden, the splintered Kingdoms of India, the Chinese 8-Banner Army and the crumbling remains of the Japanese Shogunate. Also included is a set of 8 new land tiles that will force veteran players to learn new tactics among the swamps and fields of the Orient as well as the forests of Scandanavia.<br/><br/>Sweden: The Swedes are reminiscent of the more traditional European powers and fit nicely into the current game hierarchy to allow for more balanced tournament play. The Swedish army fits the mold of both the Prussians and Russians but falls into line just below them in overall strength.<br/><br/>Indians: The Kingdoms of the Marathas, Mughals, Mysore and Sikhs from the Punjab have banded together to overthrow the colonial powers of the day. Their problem is overcoming the lack of a true leader that makes it difficult to set aside their rivalries and squabbling. They have speed rivaling the Ottomans but far less of a capacity to use it well. They are a true guerilla force adept at denying their opponents resources or freedom to maneuver.<br/><br/>Tokugawa Shogunate: The Shogunate is crumbling. The army seeks to modernize against the will of the Shogun and in a few years Japan will step into the Industrial age. However, at the turn of the 19th Century, insular clans still dominated the military. Every Daimyo leads his own army into battle with their own guns, cavalry, samurai and teppo. Only the Shogun can be called on to make any Clan work with another. Beware the deadly fury of the Banzai charge and even cornered units will fight to the bitter end and the last man.<br/><br/>China: The Chinese 8-Banner army boasts a core of elite units, including three cavalry units that can stand their ground against any European foe. Unfortunately, the Han conscripts and the peasants that form the Tuan Lian are ill-suited and under-equipped in relation to their Manchu and Mongol horsemen.

Unlike many other tabletop miniatures wargames, the Wargods system uses hidden activation counters in order to simulate fog of war.<br/><br/>In this reincarnation, players simulate massive battles in the land of Ultima Thule by taking control of a race of fierce creatures called the Wendigo, who are led to battle by formidable Ice Witches, masters of snow and wind. Although one off clashes occur frequently between warring factions, Wargods of Hyberborea offers dedicated warmongers an immersive game play experience through campaign play.

Thrilling Intense March?) or simply GanGan, is a 1994 one-on-one fighting arcade game developed by Alpha Denshi Corp. (ADK) and published by SNK. The English game title is a pun on the developer's initials and also parodies Mortal Kombat, spelling the word combat with K instead of C.<br/><br/>The game's major innovation is the ability to walk into the background, in a similar manner to some 1980s arcade fighting games like Taito's Violence Fight, SNK's Street Smart and Atari's Pit-Fighter. Because of this, unlike many other 2D fighting games, the game uses one action button to jump, and does not use the &quot;D&quot; button, unlike many SNK fighting games. Only two action buttons are used for attacking (punch and kick); instead, grappling and grabbing opponents is the focus of the gameplay: opponents can counter being grabbed and break free as well. Also featured is weapon play (another mechanic akin to beat 'em ups). Weapons can be picked up and thrown, or used in special and standard attacks. Weapons are thrown into the ring by spectators in the background. Another (unusual) innovation of the game is that characters begin to sweat profusely after fighting for a while.<br/><br/>Characters have unusually high health for the genre with a health bar that has several layers of colors to indicate the health. There is also a &quot;Crazy Meter&quot; at the bottom of the screen. It is built up as characters attack; this gives the character a special &ndash; and often very bizarre &ndash; attack that will kill the opponent outright. It is called the &quot;Gan Gan Attack&quot; in Japan, and &quot;Crazy Attack&quot; internationally.<br/><br/>Battles are joined by irreverent, sometimes humorous pre-fight banter from characters. The dialogue differs from opponent to opponent, and the fight is immediately presaged by a clash of two small images of the combatants' eyes in the center of the screen. There are almost no differences between the Japanese release of this game and the International versions aside from the rather drastic name change, but it is worth taking notice that there is blood to be found when you use a critical hit on an opponent on the Japanese release only.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Aggressors of Dark Kombat&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "106136": {"statistics": {}, "name": "3 Count Bout", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"121083": "Arcade edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1552471.png", "videogametheme": {"2375": "Sports - Wrestling"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2159": "Fighting"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1552471_t.png", "description": "Count Bout, known in Japan as Fire Suplex (\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u30b9\u30fc\u30d7\u30ec\u30c3\u30af\u30b9), is a wrestling arcade game released by SNK in 1993.<br/><br/>The game consists of 5 championships with their own stages.

Press the A button to punch. Press the B button to kick. Press the C button to jump. Press the A and B buttons simultaneously for a quick moving retreat. Pull the joystick twice in a direction to rush that way. If the player rushes in the direction of a boxing ring edge, they can bounce back.

When the player and opponent clash in a wrestle, press the A and B buttons as fast as possible to push back. Press Button D to pin down a downed opponent and hold him for 3 seconds to win.

Among the earliest were the Polynesians who sailed between the islands of the Pacific, and the Phoenicians who plied the waters of the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean beyond. Still, none were more famous than the single Greek flotilla, one thousand ships strong, that sailed from Mycenae to make war on the city of Troy.<br/><br/>The events of that battle have now been woven into the fabric of the world's history and folklore?Paris? abduction of Helen, Achilles? showdown with Hector, Odysseus? stratagem of the Trojan Horse. Some of the details are not so well know, however. One such is the homeward voyage made by Menelaus and Helen, during which their ship was cast adrift in a storm. It was during this peril that one of the vessels accompanying Menelaus ran aground on the south side of the island of Crete. What has been lost to memory is the fact that the vessel carried a sacred artifact pilfered from Troy?a statue of Athena, said to have fallen from heaven, known as the Palladium.<br/><br/>Recently the light of discovery has fallen again upon this relic. In the midst of a powerful storm and pummeling southerly winds, a fisherman named Ioannes Kafouros suffered his own shipwreck in the same location where Menelaus? ship was lost. Ioannes managed to swim to shore, and eventually returned to where he?d lost his boat. When he dove down to retrieve items from the wreckage, however, he was quite surprised to find the remains of a far older vessel as well. With help from fishermen in the local town he began to explore the wreck, and was amazed to find that it held long-lost golden treasures. Two items were especially notable, however. One is a marble bust of a remarkably beautiful woman; the other is an olivewood statue depicting a maiden in full battle armor. The bust proved relatively easy to salvage, but the statue required extra care. Because of this, Kafouros has set out for Heraklion to procure additional equipment.

As part of the preparation that was undertaken for the influx of tourists, the Greek government had authorized an almost unprecedented level of construction and similar development. One such project, under the supervision of a local construction contractor named Alexos Konstantinos, uncovered a series of tunnels beneath the Akropolis. Previously unknown, these tunnels could yield a wealth of new information regarding that famed landmark.

It is a sequel to Antarctic Adventure and has the distinction of being the first game that game designer Hideo Kojima worked on; he was an assistant designer.

Items can be purchased through three different fisherman, in exchange for fish, that give Pentarou new abilities. One of the items that can be bought is a gun, which reflects the charactization Pentarou is given in his appearances in the Parodius series. Level design and variety has increased from Antarctic Adventure; there are forest levels, ice levels, water-based levels, caves, and even an outer-space bonus level. There are several shortcuts, usually hidden underneath holes (which are typically harmful hazards) in the game, that allow the player to go on almost completely different paths.

According to the story, Jack has fallen in love with the Princess Grizelda, but knows the king would never allow his daughter to marry a lowly court jester. Unless, of course, he were to perform some kind of noble and heroic act. That chance comes for Jack the day a gang of dragons attack the kingdom, stealing the magical black lamp which protects the kingdom from harm.

Jack, under the player's control, has to run, jump, climb and shoot his way through the kingdom of Allegoria in search of nine different coloured lamps, while under constant assault by all manner of creatures. Eight of the nine lamps may be found randomly scattered around the kingdom (in locations which change with each new game), but the ninth lamp, the black lamp, is guarded by a dragon which must be defeated before the lamp can be recovered.

His mythology was later subsumed into the Cthulhu canon when H. P.

They either destroy it, or are destroyed themselves.<br/>A seemingly utopian future takes on a distinctly nightmarish quality. The scenario plays with this by suggesting that the publication of The King in Yellow has warped history in a disturbing direction.

Hence, it does not focus on individual bouts (even though hundreds of fights are simulated during the game), but on the whole of a rikishi's (sumo wrestler) career.<br/><br/>There are 12 rikishi in the game, but only a small number of those are player-controled; the others are 'automated', i.e. controled by the game. The game is intended to be played by a very small number of players or solitaire. In principle it could work with up to 6, but it is recommended for 2 or 3 players.<br/><br/>During a single game year, rikishi first train, which means that they improve their skills in 1 or 2 of 5 different areas of skill (endurance, strength, weight (yes, that's a skill here...), speed, technique). In the meanwhile their oyakata (stable masters, comp. coaches) try to improve their spirits, which works like a 6th skill.<br/><br/>After training the basho (tournament) begins. A whole year of sumo (6 basho) is condensed into a single tournament (of 45 bouts) in the game. Every bout is decided by the match tactic and a number of dice.

The members are all creatures that are not controlled by a god, and they all wear bracelets to show their membership in this Brotherhood. Once the player completes a mission, they can then fight the creature that gave them the mission or choose to fight that creature again or use that creature at will. Once the player has successfully completed all the missions and won all the fights, they will be able to see Eve and have a baby pet for their creature. The player's pet will then have a pet, which can help both the creature and the player. Also, there is the speed miracle, though no skirmishes included in the game carry it. It can be used to get past various trials more easily. If the player does not have a creature of certain height, the creature will be enlarged. It will also automatically know the three basic spells (food, water, and wood).

Once the player has two or more monsters in reserve, they can be combined, creating a new monster with traits of both 'parents.'<br/><br/>Once the player has a monster, it can then be raised to be a fighting machine. There are six stats that determine how the monster does in battle: Power fuels physical attacks, Intelligence fuels and defends against energy attacks, Life determines monster's hit points, Skill affects accuracy, Speed helps evade opponents' attacks, and Defense reduces damage received from physical attacks. Monsters train either by doing chores nearby, or can be sent to be trained by experts, where they have the chance to gain new attack techniques.<br/><br/>The primary way to advance through the game is through monster fighting tournaments. While in battle, each monster has attacks available to it, some moves are only available at close range, others from a distance. Players cannot control the monster directly in a fight, but can call for their monster to stay away or close in, and attack with whichever move is available at the current range.<br/><br/>In Monster Rancher 2 and Monster Rancher Advance 2, Holly, the assistant from this game, cameos as a rancher from the group, AGIMA, who you train monsters for.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Monster Rancher (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "106468": {"videogame": {"106470": "4 Action Hits"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "'43: One Year After", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"122023": "Commodore 64 Cassette edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1086297.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2514": "Flight"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "3", "videogamegenre": {"2505": "Shoot 'em Up"}, "videogameplatform": {"4420": "Commodore 64"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"106470": "4 Action Hits"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1086297_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>1943 is a flight game in arcade style by Greve Graphics in 1987, released only on the Commodore 64.

Though only one is available at the start of the game, the five different homes that you can raise your monster in represent five climates, each with its own training regimes, features, and food.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Monster Rancher 3&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "106470": {"videogame": {"106468": "'43: One Year After"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "4 Action Hits", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"122029": "Commodore 64 Cassette edition"}, "average": "5", "videogametheme": {"2514": "Flight"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4420": "Commodore 64"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"106468": "'43: One Year After"}, "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>4 Action Hits is a compilation of four games by Greve Graphics.

Monsters are created via a &quot;Saucer Stone&quot; regeneration system. Players must go to a Shrine, where they swap the Monster Rancher 4 disc with a CD, DVD, or another game disc. A monster is then generated from the data contained on that disc. Once a player regenerates a monster, they can raise it on a ranch, and train it to compete in battles. The limit for monsters depend on the size of their ranch but the maximum is 5 monsters.<br/><br/>One of the features of Monster Rancher 4 is exploring different lands for rare items and to discover special monster breeds. The player's team of monsters accompanies them on these journeys, battling stray monsters and the &quot;Boss&quot; monster of each area. These battles can help raise the monsters' experience. At the beginning of the game, the player can only visit a limited number of areas, but as they progress through the game, they will be able to visit more advanced and dangerous areas. Some areas have special rare monster breeds that cannot be found anywhere else, and once the player finds these rare monsters, they will be able to regenerate them and raise them on their ranch.

Players sit opposite each other<br/>2. Remove coins from bottom of box (undernearth plastic tray).  Place coins at random, (in full view of both players) one under each of 10 &quot;money bags&quot; (2 bags will remain empty).<br/>3. Dealer shuffles the small Coin Selection Cards (those depicting the actual coins used in the game) and deals five to himself and five to his opponent, alternating and FACE UP. During the subsequent play of the game, each player will try to obtain as many of the coins shown on his small cards as possible. Obviously, this combination of coins will change with each game.<br/>4. Dealer shuffles the Playing Cards and deals five cards to himself and five cards to his opponent, alternating, and FACE DOWN.  The remaining cards are placed faced down in the DRAW tray.<br/>5. Players pick up the five playing cards. The dealer draws a card and must then play a card from his hand either in front of him to count toward his score, or into the discard tray. At no time after playing a card may a player have more than five cards remaining in his hand.<br/>6. If a player has a SEARCH CARD, he may play it face down in the discard tray and then &quot;search&quot; for one of his coins (designated on his Coin Selection Cards).  He does this by touching one of the &quot;money bags&quot; and declaring, for example &quot;the Turkish kurus is in this bag.&quot; He then lifts the &quot;bag&quot; and if the Turkish kurus IS underneath the &quot;bag&quot;, he removes the coin and places it in front of him as part of his score.  He then replaces the &quot;money bag&quot;.  As the game progresses, ocoins and empty areas will be exposed and it will become increasingly important to remember their locations.  If a player exposes one of his opponent's coin, he merely replaces the bag and it is the opponent's turn.  If the opponent has a SEARCH CARD, he is in the happy position of eing able to acquire a coin immediately.  Players draw and play cards alternately.<br/>7. If a player has a $5,000 or $2,000 COIN CARD he may hold it for future play, he may play it face up in front of him counting toward his score, or he may discard it.<br/>8. If a player has a WINDFALL CARD he may lift ANY bag and remove the coin - IF it is one of HIS coins.<br/>9. If a player has an ILLEGAL COIN CARD, he may play it on his opponent's score pile. The opponent then may not play ANY card except a LEGAL COIN CARD or a SEARCH CARD on his next turn. In the meantime he must discard one card into the discard tray after every draw. If he plays a SEARCH CARD, this permits him to search for a coin. If he plays a LEGAL COIN CARD, he takes no further action until his next turn.<br/>10. If the &quot;Draw&quot; tray is emptied before the game ends, reshuffle those in the &quot;discard&quot; tray and continue play.<br/><br/>WHO WINS:<br/>The first player to accumulate $100,000 or more in coins and cards.
