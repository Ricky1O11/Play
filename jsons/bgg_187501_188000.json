Shove too many in one cage, and they'll be worth almost nothing to you.<br/><br/>In each round, someone deals a line of twelve cards face up on the table; each card depicts an animal (a curio in the original version) along with a point value and a limit. The starting player splits the line in two by choosing a dividing point. Each player holds two cards showing the left or right group, and each player chooses, then simultaneously reveals which group of cards they want. If only one player chooses a side, they take all the cards in that group and add them to their personal tableau. If a side is chosen by more than one player, however, then one of the players who chose it splits that group into two smaller groups, then everyone who originally chose this group secretly votes again for which group they want. This process repeats with each group until either each player has taken some number of cards or groups have been reduced to single cards and two or more players are still voting to take them; in this case, those single cards are placed in a special pile. At the start of a round, the starting player adds a special card to the line-up and whoever wins this card collects all of the animals in this special pile.<br/><br/>Players complete three rounds this way, then score points. If a group of cards has exceeded the limit on it &mdash; say, by collecting four cards when the limit is three &mdash; then the owner of these cards scores only 1 point per card instead of the point value for each card. Some cards in the game allow you to remove cards from your collection, possibly allowing you to stay under the limit and score more points. You might also start trying not to win cards so as not to spoil the value of what you've already collected. (In Curio Collectors, you would effectively crash the market value for an item by trying to sell too many of them at one time.)<br/><br/>Whoever has the most points wins!<br/><br/>"}, "187516": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Sorcerer King", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"290480": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "average": "7.5", "videogameseries": {"22852": "Elemental"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "2", "videogamegenre": {"2391": "4x Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "A NEW KIND OF FANTASY STRATEGY GAME<br/><br/>Sorcerer King is a new direction for strategy game design, pitting the player against a single overwhelmingly powerful enemy instead of a set of evenly matched factions racing for abstract victory conditions.<br/><br/>Think of the Sorcerer King as the evil mage who already won the last traditional game. He has already conquered the world. His enemies (including you) are scattered, their armies broken and cities torn down. His dark minions have free reign to terrorize the survivors everywhere except a few tiny outposts of civilization (like the one you start in) too insignificant to crush.<br/><br/>EXPANDING YOUR KINGDOM<br/><br/>What do you know, there was another one of those darn cataclysms. It's up to you to rebuild a kingdom that can stand up to the bad guys.<br/><br/>You'll need to clear out monsters and bandits with heroes and armies, then send pioneers to build cities on arable land and outposts to claim outlying resources.<br/><br/>Expanding your kingdom via pioneers is vital, and should be one of your highest priorities.<br/><br/>EXPLORING THE LAND<br/><br/>The landscape is dotted with a random selection of the hundreds of quests in Sorcerer King. Completing them grants you crafting components, lore for researching new spells, new units, magical artifacts, and can even increase or decrease the Doomsday Counter.<br/><br/>If you see something interesting on the map, chances are you should explore it and see what it is. At the very least, you'll probably get a chuckle out of the writing - Chris Bucholz of Cracked.com writes all of our quests, and he's a funny guy.<br/><br/>EXTERMINATING THE MONSTERS<br/><br/>Battles in Sorcerer King are quick and to the point. Nearly every unit in the game has a special ability, from Tandis' sweep attack that hits all adjacent enemies to the Stalker's deadly maul, which hits over and over again until dodged.<br/><br/>Your sovereign can cast spells to help your forces out. A quick heal or weak summoned skeleton might give your armies the edge in the early game, but later on calling down devastating blizzards or walls of living flame can practically win battles by themselves.<br/><br/>SAVING THE WORLD<br/><br/>The Sorcerer King is trying to destroy the shards. Stop him, or it's the literal end of the world.<br/><br/>Each shard destroyed by the Sorcerer King's forces pushes the Doomsday Counter forward. If it fills up, it's game over.<br/><br/>Complete quests in benevolent ways to lower the Doomsday Counter and delay the Sorcerer King's victory, and defend the shards as best you can to keep the assault at bay.<br/><br/>FACING THE SORCERER KING<br/><br/>There is only one way to win in Sorcerer King: You must defeat him in battle. Naturally, it's easier said than done.<br/><br/>First, you must find his two lieutenants. Don't worry, you can't miss the enormous fire and ice demons roaming the landscape. Bringing lots of friends and a full mana bank to any confrontation with the lieutenants is highly recommended.<br/><br/>Once you've bested both lieutenants, you must fight your way to the heart of the Sorcerer King's domain. Even more friends and as much mana as you can possibly scrounge together are a good idea at this point.<br/><br/>CRAFTING<br/><br/>Crafting is critical in Sorcerer King. Killing monsters and completing quests gives you crafting materials, which you can turn into everything from basic chainmail to epic flaming swords.<br/><br/>Both heroes and regular units can use crafted items. A fully equipped unit can be several times more effective than a bare one.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "187517": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Alemungula", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"26432": "Combinatorial"}, "average": "5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"171": {"name": "(Public Domain)"}}, "boardgameversion": {"290481": "Public Domain edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "9", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "From Mancala World:<br/><br/>Alemungula is a mancala game played by the Wetawit (formerly spelled Wetaweat) in Ethiopia, around the towns of Asosa and Beni Sangul, towards the Sudan border.

The population of this group is about 248,000.<br/><br/>The game is played mainly by youngsters, though sometimes also by adults in their leisure time.

The game was implemented by Arty Sandler for online play at igGameCenter on December 19, 2010.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>Alemungula is played on a wooden board which consists of 2x5=10 holes known as tisiya alemungula (&quot;alemungula wood&quot;), while the holes are called ful alemungula. Play is begun with five stones in each hole.<br/><br/>At his turn, a player picks up all the contents of one of his holes and then distributes, one by one, the stones into the following holes, the direction depending on the hole chosen. Moves from either of a player's two left-hand holes are made in clockwise direction, moves from either of the player's two right-hand holes are made in an anti-clockwise direction, and moves from the center hole may be made in either direction.

Each player then captures the stones remaining on his side.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who captured the greater number of stones during the game.

If Lee wants to achieve those aims, he needs to cut off that retreat at a place called Glendale, which requires the careful coordination of his generals. But, par for the course, only A.P. Hill and Longstreet seem capable of doing what they&rsquo;re told: Ben Huger and his men are too busy moonlighting as lumberjacks, while Stonewall Jackson fights a pointless artillery duel at White Oak Swamp - when he&rsquo;s not napping, anyway. Difficult terrain and fresh, high-quality Union brigades mean that the weary Confederates have their work cut out for them. The optional Galena Rule gives the Union command-control problems of their own to contend with.<br/><br/>Like other titles in the series, a  modified 2d6 die roll determines which Confederate divisions activate on a given turn. Divisions that didn't pull there weight are less likely to show up than those that did most of the fighting. It's a simple, clever, and elegant way to recreate the difficulties that Lee had during the Seven Days.<br/><br/>Blood Before Richmond builds on the same &quot;stacks of steps&quot; combat system introduced in Tom Russell's Blood on the Alma (2012). Flipping a counter over when you take a hit just doesn't capture the feel of bloody infantry collisions or the horrifying impact of artillery fire.

Great for girls and boys alike aged seven upwards (and fun-loving grown-ups too!), the Where's Wally? Board Game is a race against time where being eagle-eyed and speedy is a winning combination! Players must find the picture on the board which matches the picture on their card.

The aim of the game is to be the fastest player to find and cover Where's Wally? pictures on the board with a Wally token. The next player tries to do the same and so the game continues until the timer stops. A card with a number '2' on it means double the challenge - you have to match the picture on your card to the picture on the board twice before play moves on. And if you collect a card with an 'R' on it, the direction of play is reversed and the four sections of the Where's Wally? board must be rearranged too.

Players are dealt six cards to their hand and a number of cards are laid face-up matching the number of players. Everyone chooses a card from their hand and reveals it. Cards that match up go to the player, everything else is discarded. Repeat this until the players' hands are empty, then score. Total up the whole of the cards you collected, the player with the highest total wins a token. Shuffle the whole deck over, play another round. The game ends when the fifth token is given out, the most tokens wins.<br/><br/>Matching cards simply means matching the number on the card, so if the table shows 1,3,3,4 and you're the only one to lay a 4, you get both 4s. But if more than one player lays a 4, you all get nothing. If two players each laid a 3, they'd each get a 3 from the table. If one player laid a 3, they'd only get one 3.<br/><br/>But if a 1 is matched in a turn, then the highest value table card is discarded, and so any matches are also lost. This brings in double-think, what are they other players likely to do? Do you go for the 4, or try a safer 3? What looks like a simple game becomes more cunning and watching what cards have already been played matters.<br/><br/>The card art is lovely, showing a variety of spiny creatures, sea urchins, lizards, turtles, porcupines.

In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:<br/><br/>     As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.<br/>     As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you'll need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.<br/><br/>Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy.

The school yard is no place for the meek. Only one man can protect the innocent children from bullies, cheaters, and thiefs. But unfortunately Principal Jones is usually too tied up with PTA meetings, in-service days, and keeping his office chair warm. That leaves Adin Simon, private eye, gumshoe, and sleuth to clean up after the fact. Fourth grade may not be safe, but with a bit of grit and determination he'll solve your case and bring your culprit to justice...or get wedgied trying.<br/><br/>Fourth Grade Confidential is a microgame of deduction, bluffing, and cunning, based on Neal Simon's comic book project called Fourth Grade Confidential. The premise is that a fourth grader named Adin is a private eye at his school, working to solve the great mysteries of elementary school, like who stole his sister's stuffed pink bunny.<br/><br/>In Fourth Grade Confidential one player is the Sleuth while 2-4 other players are the Characters. Each round the Sleuth is trying to solve a different mystery. The Sleuth has six Sleuth Cards and the other 12 cards are dealt evenly to the Characters. The Sleuth has six turns to try to figure out which Character has the Target Item for that round by calling out various attributes and seeing who has items with matching attributes. Through careful deduction and use of actions the Sleuth and Characters all try to be the player to end up with the Target Item.<br/><br/>The Sleuth: Each round a new player will take on the roll of the Sleuth. The Sleuth will be questioning the Characters and following up clues. If the Sleuth catches Characters lying about the items they have he'll get to perform additional actions to help him narrow down where the Target Item is.<br/><br/>The Characters: All other players are Characters in the current mystery. One Character will have the Target Item that the Sleuth is looking for. As the Sleuth questions Characters they will begin to reveal items they have to prove their innocence, or to throw the Sleuth off the track. Can you be cunning enough to keep the Target Item hidden from the Sleuth? Are you going to help the Sleuth figure out who is the Culprit? Maybe you're just out for yourself. Characters get to take actions if they reveal items the Sleuth is looking for, without giving up the Target Item. But if they are caught lying the Sleuth gets extra actions to help him find the Culprit.<br/><br/>The round ends when the Sleuth runs out of Actions or when he finds the Target Item. Scoring can be totaled for each round and then scores totaled after everyone has had a chance to be the Sleuth an equal number of times.<br/><br/>"}, "187656": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Silence", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"290682": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3529820.png", "videogameseries": {"28877": "The Whispered World"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "2", "average": "5.5", "videogamegenre": {"2749": "Point-and-Click"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "videogamehonor": {"30786": "2014 Gamescom Best Family Game of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3529820_t.png", "description": "Taking place some time after the first game, it stars Noah, the young boy who was awoken from a coma at the end of the original game.

Vitality is parceled out among Head, Upper and Lower Torso, Left and Right Arm, and Left and Right Leg.  Attribute have Points which are purchased during character creation, ranging from 1 to 6 (they may exceed that later during play).  The same point pool also is used to purchase Skills (Skills are not defined though several are offered as samples).  Vitality has a different scoring mechanism and starts at 900 (total).<br/><br/>Action resolution is performed by rolling a dice pool and looking for successes (using a peculiar method) against a target number.  The number of dice in the pool is determined by the Attribute or Skill Points value associated with the action.  The individual dice results are used to build a two-digit number that exceeds the target number.  For example, a 4d10 roll of 2, 5, 6, and 8 would be scored at 86.<br/><br/>Combat is more complex and somewhat poorly defined.  It also uses the peculiar method of dice result handling.  Combat involves several &quot;special case&quot; rules for various weapons, armors, and so forth.  Damage is calculated by a fairly strange method of doing two calculations, each of which does damage.

It was re-created in 1960 by Saveliy Yakovlevich Pahayev, a professor of the Gorno-Altaisk Research Institute of History, Language and Literature. In 1974, some reasearchers of this institute &quot;improved&quot; the rules and, in the following year, the first tourna&shy;ment was held in the capital of the Altay Republic. The game soon became a popular mindsport in the Altay region and is also play in Khakassia, Tuva and Buryatia. There were over-the-board  tour&shy;na&shy;ments in Russia (Besh-Ozek (Altay), Chernogorsk (Khakassia), Elo (Altay), Gorno-Altaysk (Altay), Kosh-Agach (Altay), Kyzyl (Tuva), Onguday (Altay), Shebalino (Altay), Ulan-Ude (Bur&shy;yatia)), Ust-Kan (Altay), and Yabogan (Altay).<br/><br/>In addition, there is another &quot;Shatra&quot;, which is a little bit more chess-like and, which is mostly played outside of Altay. It was invented by Vladimir Leonidovich Taushkanov in the 1970s who helped to finalize the Shatra rules in 1974, but went a step further. The older variant popular in the Altay region can be called &quot;Shatra I&quot; and the slightly newer variant, which is today almost exclusively played outside of the Altay region (mainly in the European part of Russia) &quot;Shatra II&quot;. There is also a four-sided variation of Shatra I that can be played by four players.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to mate the opponent's king (biy). Besides the king, Shatra I has 16 pieces, which move like Russian checkers men. In Shatra II there is a king (biy), a queen (bat&iuml;r), two rooks (tura), two bishops (jalk&iuml;n) and 11 pawns (&scaron;atra). Capturing is in both variants mandatory and by jumping similar to checkers. The board has a very unusual shape and was influenced by Chinese Chess (the autonomous Altay Republic borders to China). It has a battlefield, a ditch, a gate and a fortress.<br/><br/>Shatra I can be played online at Abstract Games (a Russian site) and Shatra II at Chess Variants Game Courier. Recently a book was published about Shatra I. Draws are possible and might be substantial similar to checkers and chess, particularly in Shatra I, if the game is played by masters. However, in Shatra I tournaments at Abstract Games, which are played among weak amateurs from Russia, Belarus and Germany, only every 15th game ends in a draw. In Shatra I, there are 400 possible board positions after ply 2. The branching factor is similar to chess.<br/><br/>"}, "187663": {"poll": {}, "name": "Star Wars: Death Star Attack", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2009": "Trick-taking"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"11505": "Promotional Board Games"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2857655_t.jpg", "average": "2", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5215": {"name": "Cartamundi"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2857655.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"290695": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Simple 2 player card game.

The game is sometimes described as intellectual martial arts. It is about listening and being extremely focused and fast, just like the Samurai with their swords. Only here you fight with cards instead.<br/><br/>The game is comprised of two decks of cards, the Reader deck and the Player deck. Cards in the Reader deck contain short poems or poetry quotations while cards in the Player deck contain only the second part of these poems. To begin the game, a Reader is chosen (or you may opt to use the Reader app) and the players are divided into two teams sitting on opposite sides of the table or play area. The Reader shuffles the Reader deck and the Players mix, split evenly the Player deck between the teams and place them face-up in 3-4 rows in front of them. The Reader will read the complete poetry quotation on their cards and the player that finds the matching card first takes that card and puts it aside. If the card taken was on your opponent's side, you must give one card from your side to your opponent. The first team that has no cards left on their side is the winner (you must get rid of all your cards first, to win).<br/><br/>The game is set in Japan during the Genpei war (1180-1185). In order to win the war, you need a strategy. Place the cards you are familiar with close to you (in the beginning it is normal that none of the cards are familiar). If you know what cards your opponent is familiar with, place those cards as far as possible from them inside the playing field. Since the reader or app will always read the complete quotation, you do not need prior knowledge of the poems. Strategically place the playing cards in a way that you can find and take them quickly such as laying them alphabetically or categorize them under the same first words.<br/><br/>Ogoola Karuta Poetry Game is not a translation of the original Japanese game. In this first edition, we have selected 50 of the well-known classical poems written in the English language. It is the first western version of Hyakunin-isshu Karuta, which means Karuta: 100 poems by 100 poets.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"290714": "First edition"}, "average": "9", "name": "Ogoola Karuta: 50 English Classics", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2689": "Action / Movement Programming"}, "age": "10", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"37624": "Ogoola Karuta"}}, "187676": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2790306.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"52328": "Malifaux"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"31723": {"name": "Mason Crawford"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "12", "boardgamepublisher": {"10053": {"name": "Wyrd Miniatures"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2790306_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1010": {"name": "Fantasy"}}, "description": "This starter set contains everything you need to learn and start playing Malifaux!

While working on the development of The Secret World Inside You, exhibition co-curator Susan Perkins, an avid tabletop game enthusiast, pioneered an idea to create a card game allowing players to learn about the community of microbes that live in our guts, known as the gut microbiome. Gutsy is based on the various ways we interact with those microbes on a daily basis and turns those interactions into a fun and educational card game.<br/><br/>The object of the game is for players to attempt to be first to create a healthy gut by diversifying their gut microbiome, which is influenced by what we eat and drink, whom we interact with, and the medicines that we take.<br/><br/>Two to four players draw from a common card deck, collecting microbes and pathogens to build their respective guts.<br/><br/>The first player to have six different kinds of gut microbes wins. The game is intended for players ages eight and up.<br/><br/>Perkins worked with the Museum&rsquo;s Associate Director for Digital Learning, Barry Joseph, and high school students in the Museum&rsquo;s Lang Science Program, educators, as well as Eric Teo, from the New York University Game Center MFA program, to create Gutsy.<br/><br/>Playing on the popularity of social card games like Sushi Go! and Killer Bunnies, the developers used illustrations, photos, and information created for The Secret World Inside You exhibition.<br/><br/>"}, "187689": {"statistics": {}, "name": "SWR JST DX Selective Memory Erase Effect", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"290738": "Windows Downloadable Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2738746.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2337": "Cute Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "3", "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2738746_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A difficult platformer, you play a cat trying to get through some simple platforms guarded by hidden and difficult enemies.

In 1860? In 1792? Let the voters decide! Election! is an interactive family board game with a focus on America&rsquo;s greatest leaders.<br/><br/>As a player, you have been granted the power to manage a political party that is desperate for control of the White House. In addition to selecting candidates, you may also take advantage of external factors to influence the election in your party's favor. Should you stay positive by gaining the support of a popular activist or attempt to smear an opponent's image by revealing a scandal? Do you take the high road and try to win ethically or attempt to sabotage your opponents through dirty politics? Should you throw in the towel or demand a recount? Votes are all that matters as you navigate your way to the White House.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/><br/>1) Determine the Election Year: Each round, randomly select an Election Year card that lists the most important issues of that time in American history.<br/><br/>2) Party Nominations: Each player selects 1 of the 5 Presidential Candidate cards from their hand.  Players nominate a candidate based on ratings that show the card&rsquo;s overall polling strength of the issues being discussed.<br/><br/>3) Roll Dice to Determine Votes: Custom dice are rolled based on a candidate's rating. The rating corresponds to the important issues set on the Election Year card. Higher ratings often result in more votes.<br/><br/>Bonus) Red Tape and Public Opinion cards are wild cards that have the power to impact an election (for better or worse).<br/><br/>4) The player with the most votes wins the election and advances along the game board.  The winner is the first player to advance to the White House space at the end of the board.<br/><br/>After winning a series of elections with shrewd strategy and a bit of luck, the player who first advances to the White House space on the board wins the game and earns the right to be called Mr. or Mrs. President!

The player who sees more gold cats takes the first turn. On a turn, a player pushes a block away from them (so that it falls on the table), pulls a block toward them, or declares the end of the game. If you push a block and the face that lands facing up appears on another face-up block, then you keep the block that you just pushed over.

Each gold cat is worth 2 points, while each non-gold cat is worth 1 point. A pair of one blue and one red cat is worth an additional 3 points (for 5 total points).

Ask any parent who has lied to his child about the loss of a loved one. Ask any man who was ever asked if everything was going to be okay when he knew it would not. Sometimes the truth is too ugly for people to hear. Sometimes if the truth were known it would change everything.

One is omitted from public view though. The ones you&rsquo;ve seen are what are shown to the rest of the world but nothing is as transparent as that. Even the founding fathers had spy networks, without which their revolution would have failed in its earliest days. There is indeed a nineteenth power in Article I Section 8. It&rsquo;s very specific and highly secretive and involves the security of this nation, outside the scope of its military, navy, militia, or even the highly known FBI or CIA.<br/><br/>To execute this power, a bureau within the government exists, layered in secrecy and discretely funded.

The normal array is on board A; board B starts empty.<br/><br/>In turn, each player makes a single move on either board following these three rules:<br/><br/>1. A move must be legal on the board where it is played.<br/>2. A piece can only move or capture if the corresponding destination square on the other board is vacant.<br/>3. After moving, the piece is transfered to the corresponding square on the other board.<br/><br/>The original board (not the &quot;mirror board&quot;) decides the game:<br/><br/>Whenever a player has no piece left on the original board, he loses even within a move. A move consists of up to three stages: Movement (which can be a jump in case of a capture), Transfer of the moved piece to the other board, Removal of any captured pieces. That is, if at any stage a player had no pieces left on the original board, he lost the game.<br/><br/>In practice, it is possible to play Alician Draughts on a single board, if the checkers have a piece of felt glued to their bottom.

After a year of successive failures to bring this vision to reality, the design director took a proposal to the company board that a new design was what was needed instead of attempting to modify an already successful existing design.<br/><br/>The board of directors agreed and design work commenced on a new merchant ship (simply called type one) that included the cargo handling improvements initially proposed.<br/><br/>Over the six months of design, the initial three hundred tonne design was increased to four hundred tonnes to improve cargo capacity. Outwardly the type one was inspired by the style of the larger Atlas-class freighter which was license-built and maintained by BSI&rsquo;s main shipyard orbiting Boone.<br/><br/>The type one became the Lee-class merchant vessel and is now one of the most popular new options for carrying cargo throughout Clement Sector.<br/><br/>The Lee-class merchant vessel is an ideal ship to be used for merchant characters within Clement Sector or in any Traveller setting.  The ship's versatility allows it to be the home vessel for a variety of character groups from merchants to pirates to those simply needing an efficient vessel to get from Point A to Point B.  The vessel has been designed to be used by a group of player characters and will become a valuable asset for Referees to use in any sort of Traveller game.<br/><br/>Ships of Clement Sector 10: Lee-class Merchant Vessel comes complete with beautiful views of the ship.  The Lee-class is presented with full deckplans and statistics to make your use of our product simple, easy and fun.

Maybe you are trying to convert modules or campaign settings from one of the latter editions of the &quot;World's Most Popular Roleplaying System&quot; into a simpler and potentially more elegant gaming system, and want to offer new racial options for characters in such a campaign. It might even be that you are seeking new and unusual racial character options to add spice and variety to your own homebrew setting. Whatever your reasons for wanting more Old School character races, the Book of Races intended to help you meet those needs and then some.<br/><br/>Welcome to the Book of Races. This supplement has been developed with the Swords &amp; Wizardry rules system in mind, and should prove easy to use for both Referees and players alike. Other &ldquo;retro-clone&rdquo; rules systems may find the material useful with only minimal conversion efforts. This supplement is divided into two sections. The first section, New Races, describes a dozen new races for use in your fantasy campaigns. In this section, each race is described with game mechanics as suggested by the Swords &amp; Wizardry Core Rules, which details fantasy races as a game mechanic separate from character classes. The second section, Racial Classes, provides specific racial classes for Referees that prefer their non-human characters to operate in a character class structure similar to Fighting Men, Clerics and Magic-Users.<br/><br/>The Book of Races details the Artathi, the Duar, the Elde, the Eldeblooded, the Feytouched, the Giantkin, the Goblin, the Hyrknoff, the Kelshan, the Ordath, the Vaelan and the Wyrmblooded.

At close quarters in the jungle, at night, and in hamlets surrounded by rice paddies, American soldiers faced their North Vietnamese and Vietcong enemies on even terms. FRONT TOWARD ENEMY allows players to explore intense company- and platoon-level battles from the perspective of a company commander, using a fast-playing system that provides the feel and unpredictability of small unit combat.<br/><br/>Front Toward Enemy is a simulation that recreates tactical engagements during the Vietnam War at the scale of 50 meters per hex and five minutes per turn. Units represent fire teams, heavy weapon sections, leaders, vehicles, and helicopters. Eight scenarios with set-up options recreate twelve missions that typified company-level engagements during the Vietnam War, including airmobile insertions, assaults on fortified positions, and classic search-and-destroy operations, among others.<br/><br/>Rules cover all of the elements associated with combat in Vietnam: helicopter gunships, armored vehicles, artillery support, snipers, sappers, civilians, booby-traps, medics, evacuation of the wounded, prisoner interrogation, tunnels, hidden caches, and more. Winning doesn't always mean holding the objective if the cost in casualties is too great. Sudden combat in difficult terrain causes command and control to quickly break down. A chit-pull system means command and control is erratic, and volume of fire is rewarded, but results are fickle. The unforeseen occurs, ranging from non-combat injuries to interference from higher headquarters to so-called &ldquo;friendly fire&rdquo;. Immediate action drills, staying close, and the ability to move and act as a coordinated unit ensure survivability in this environment.<br/><br/>Front Toward Enemy puts you in the middle of the toughest fighting of the longest war of the 20th Century.<br/><br/>Front Toward Enemy scales:<br/><br/><br/>     each turn is approximately 5 minutes<br/>     each hex is approximately 50 meters across<br/>     counters represent Infantry Units of one to four men (Fire Teams, Weapons Teams, Leaders, and Individuals) Helicopters, and Vehicles<br/>     Additional markers represent Civilians, Caches (rice, medical, and ammo), Bunkers, Foxholes, and Tunnel entrances<br/><br/><br/>"}, "187809": {"poll": {}, "name": "Super 4: Die Zeit l\u00e4uft!", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"28748": "Playmobil"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2769815_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"38": {"name": "Schmidt Spiele"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2769815.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"290975": "Schmidt Spiele multilingual edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "You want to help Super 4 to defeat their enemies, the Black Baron, Shark Beard, Dr X and Baba-Cara?

Best of all, you don&rsquo;t even need to take a feat or class or anything: if you have access to ki, you can start using chakra right away.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, these rules have some issues, including being extremely expensive in total ki point expenditure for what you actually get, requiring incredibly high saving throws each round at high levels, and being completely inaccessible to anyone without a ki pool. This book aims to fulfill the promise of fun and exciting chakra use made by Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Occult Adventures, by providing a way for characters to specialize in chakra use and be rewarded with more useful chakra abilities by doing so.

In the first move (each player's first turn) the players put their three remaining pieces on the row next to their other pieces in any order they want them.<br/> After that players move at their turn one of their pieces diagonally forward to an adjacent empty square. Players also can jump over their own pieces or over those of their opponent (even combining both colors) similar to Halma but only diagonally forward. However, they don't have to jump, if they don't want to, and they can stop a jumping move anywhere, not making the largest jump possible. After the last jump they are allowed to move the piece, which did the jump, one square diagonally forward to an adjacent empty square. Again, this is not mandatory. No pieces are ever captured and the jumped pieces remain untouched.<br/><br/>The first four rows of each player are called their &quot;railway station&quot; (&quot;gare&quot; in French; &quot;Bahnhof&quot; in German). Players are not permitted to enter their opponent's railway station, before they have vaca&shy;ted their own one. After a player has entered all of his pieces into the opponent's railway station, he is allowed to move or jump backward to reach the final goal position, but only as long as all of his pieces remain in the opponent's railway station.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to place nine pieces on the last row and the remaining three pieces anywhere on the penultimate row, that is to recreate a valid start position on the opponent's side of the board.<br/><br/>The name of the game is French and German mixed together (&quot;le&quot; is the masculine French article; &quot;zug&quot; means train in German).

After the capture the king becomes a normal piece again unless it ends its turn on the opponent's back row. The game stops if a player cannot make a move.

Fortunes Wheel is a framework for doing that. It exists first and foremost as an aid for playing role playing games (or &quot;RPGs&quot;) that are both fully improvised and made up as you go along, or which use various re-created settings. It can also be used to just tell stories or as a way of kick starting creativity and ideas or for resolving actions.<br/><br/>Most RPGs tend to fall back on giving you a set of rules, often fairly complex ones. In Fortunes Wheel the idea is instead to give you a basic system or tool set tied to some core concepts. In it there are suggestions of some methods, but these are not intended to be hard and fast rules, just possible ways of doing something to push the narrative along.<br/><br/>There are a few simple ideas that have some far reaching consequences at the heart of Fortunes Wheel. If you keep these in mind when playing they will help enhance both your enjoyment and understanding of it. Everything is flexible rather than hard and fixed, so if a method to do something feels right, use it, but if not, use something else (the 'rule' of common sense). This is not a rule book, it is an approach with some examples you can use. Before Dungeons and Dragons (the forerunner of most of these RPGs and story games) saw print instead of all the complex dice rolls one method used to resolve conflicts was playing rock, paper, scissors, stone. Sometimes complexity and rules can really help, but they can also get in the way and limit you.<br/><br/>"}, "187991": {"rpg": {"9041": "Mutants & Masterminds (3rd Edition)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Gan Astral Knight", "rpgproducer": {"24742": "Jacob Blackmon"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2748062.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"291265": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"171": "Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"27570": "Super Powered Legends"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2748062_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>For the Forge!<br/><br/>For thousands of years the noble Astral Knights stood guard against the Manes, a race of starfaring shapeshifters bent on conquest of the galaxy.
