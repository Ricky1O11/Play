While designed for home use by parents, many of the games in the kit are also suitable for classroom use with larger groups. The rules booklet and each game includes an introductory section about the purpose of the collection and each game. The games included in the kit are as follows:<br/><br/><br/>     Coin Exchange (Money Cube Game 1) -- A two player game using play money and two special dice, each marked with 2 pennies, 2 nickles and 2 dimes. Players simply roll the dice and collect money from the bank. The winner is the player with the most money when the bank runs out of dimes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Concentration with Number Cards and Dominoes -- A two player game using a special deck of numbered cards (0 through 9) and 10 dominoes from a standard set that have a total of 0 to 9 pips. The cards and dominoes are shuffled and arranged in a face-down tableau, and the players take turns flipping over one card and one tile, collecting matching sets.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Disappearing Train -- A two to four player board game a special board, 16 counters for each player and a special die with sides -1, -2, -3 and +3, with two other blank sides. Players make trains out of 12 of their counters and remove counters from the train according to the die roll, but the player has to roll a positive number to begin and an exact number to end. The game ends when a player collects 12 counters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Double-Digit Dice Game -- A game using two special dice, one marked 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, and the other marked 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 0. Players roll both dice in turn and try to make the largest two digit base ten number. A suggested variation is to go for the smallest number. It could also be played as a press-your-luck game. It's suggested for two to four players, but any number can play.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     High Roller -- A simple dice game suggested for two to four players, but any number can play. In turn, players roll two regular six-sided dice, then re-roll the lower, keeping track of their score. This is for the youngest players who are just learning how to count pips. The highest score after two rounds wins.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Matching Coin Game -- A game about matching coins rolled on a special die showing pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters, and placing them into the correct segments of a money tray. It's suggested for four or five players, but any number could play.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Monster Squeeze Game -- A two player guessing / deduction game using a special board and monster figures to keep track of high and low guesses on a number line. Each player in turn thinks of a number from 0 to 10 and the other makes guesses, moving the monsters until the number is guessed correctly. Fewest guesses to get the number wins.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     One-Dollar Game -- A two player game where the object is to be able to collect enough change to be able to exactly exchange for a dollar. Players collect coins according to a special die with coins on the faces, making change for larger coins along the way. A special board helps players keep track of things.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Paper Money Exchange Game (Money Cube Game 2) -- A two player game where the object is to be the first to collect $100 by collecting bills shown on a special die, making change for larger bills along the way. A board helps players keep track of things, and variations are given for collecting $1000 and adding another special die.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Plus or Minus Game -- A territorial game played on a checkers board (included in the kit). Players roll a special die with faces -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 and 3, placing or subtracting counters from the board. Suggested for 2 players, it could be played by up to four.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Spin a Number (1-10) -- A simple spin and move race game played with a single counter for each player on a track board. Suggested for 2 to 5 players, but any number could play.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Top-It -- A two player card game similar to &quot;War&quot; played with a special numbered deck.

A world where Stories and Imagination have power. Where good versus evil do battle with suction cup crossbows and flame thrower lighters. It's a game that can be as serious or as silly as you want it to be... but let's face it, it's pretty darn silly.<br/><br/>The Fuzzy Knight RPG uses &quot;The Fuzz Engine&quot;, designed to be familiar enough for regular players, and simple enough for novices to enjoy. This could be the first game you teach your children (or your nieces and nephews behind their parent's backs). Luck is available whenever you need it, just use a Story Point. But when you do there is always a price to pay, as Irony Points mount and your GM rubs his hands with glee. Don't be fooled. This isn't a game where the worst that can happen is being &quot;bonked&quot; unconcious. The unwary might quickly find themselves a pile of burning flame-resistant goo on the kitchen floor.<br/><br/>The complete Fuzzy Knights RPG includes everything you need to make your own Boxed Edition!

So long as the Codex remained safely within the warded area, covered upon its altar, its power would never be released. However, if the Temple were disturbed or the book moved from its location, the malevolent spirits of the Codex would fight for their freedom, bringing horrible plagues and curses, until a great evil came to free it from its prison. To further guard the Temple, it was buried deep beneath the group, where no one could ever find it. All traces of it were destroyed, all maps were destroyed, and all legends of the Codex were lost...almost.<br/><br/>Centuries passed, and a city was built over the site of the temple, its inhabitants not knowing what lay beneath their homes. When an earthquake fractured the ground on which the city stood, the Temple of the Iron Codex was unearthed- and the gates to the Temple shattered. Deep within the passages of the Temple, the earthquake has shaken the book from its protections, allowing the evil of the Codex to seep out past the iron gates that once enclosed it safely. That city is the site of the current adventure- and we recommend that you make it your home campaign city, the safe haven for your adventurers.

This first adventure is not required, but is recommended to take full advantage of the alterante setting of Tirna'cel.<br/><br/>The legend of the realm of Tirna'cel is well known.  Once remembered for its power-mongering warlords, homunculi-wielding sorcerers, and archfiends from the deepest pits of the Abyss, Tirna'cel has become a powerful and welcoming land over the last 600 years, due in no small part to the efforts of the warlor Tirna'gael, a member of the land's founding nobility.<br/><br/>But your party knows the truth.  You ventured into the Tomb of Tiran'gael some six months ago, and therein discovered that the fallen warlord was actually little more than his brethren: a petty, avaricious power-monger.  Possessed by a rival force which also desired the kingdom - a rare incorporeal demon called a nescent, which inhabited his body and augmented his already incredible power to unforeseen levels - Tirna'gael sought to overthrow the ancient warlords only to replace them.<br/><br/>Through Tirna'gael's augmented body, the nescent overwhelmed and eliminated the other warlords, eventually dominating the realm alone.  But before it could consolidate its rule and throw Tiran'cel into an even darker age, the secret of its power was discovered by the paladins of Garadon, a virtuous cell of justice and light.  The paladins lured Tiran'gael into the center of his own fortress and trapped him there within a powerful antimagic field.  His body withered and died but the nescent remained dormant, waiting for its chance for revenge.<br/><br/>During your visit to Tirna'gael's fortress-tomb six months ago, you accidentally released the nescent from its prison.  That enemy has since been vanquished - at least for the time being - but the memory of your pitched battle against it still lingers as you approach the original chapter house of the Order of Garadon.<br/><br/>You have been summoned.<br/><br/>"}, "60640": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Earthdawn Journal (Issue 7 - Jul 1996)", "rpgproducer": {"13181": "Kevin Knight"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic905991.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"1674": "Earthdawn Journal"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"55863": "And the Path Shall Be Perilous"}, "rpg": {"929": "Earthdawn (1st Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"332950": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic905991_t.png", "description": "Earthdawn Journal, Vol. 7<br/>An Official Publication Devoted to Earthdawn FRP<br/><br/>Cover art by Janet Ausilio<br/><br/>"}, "60641": {"rpgitemversion": {"15382": "First Edition"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Dawn of the Serpent", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic678243.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "rpgproducer": {"15646": "Brendon Goodyear"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"1788": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)"}, "average": "5.5", "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"1062": "Adventure Booster"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic678243_t.jpg", "description": "User Notes: For characters levels 5-7.<br/><br/>From the introduction (spoiler): Travel always has its hazards.

A game master might refuse to allow the class because he doesn't want to run an &quot;evil&quot; campaign, or out of fear that the class will clash with other party members. Players too, might shy away from the opportunity to play an assassin class in a campaign world where it is not clear what role the assassin plays (if there is one at all).<br/><br/>The Principled Assassin discusses the Church of Galenen, an open game content deity of assassins. But Galenen's church is more complicated that just your typical den of murderers, and the faith serves a legitimate role (of sorts) in the greater society. This product provides details regarding how Galenen came to power, the evolution of his Church, and how his followers can function in society. This product is designed to be detailed enough to provide a new level of depth while remaining generic enough to fit into almost any campaign.<br/><br/>The Principled Assassin touches briefly on events first referenced in Gods of the Dead, in which we introduced four open game content deities of death and undeath. However the history presented can be easily tweaked to work in your own campaigns. The references to the Great Reckoning can be ignored or altered as needed to fit Galenen into your campaign world.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this product offers you a ready-made mythos and institution to drop into your game setting to add a new level of detail to the world.<br/><br/>What this product isn't:<br/>There are no new classes or prestige classes, and only a handful of new spells. There are other products available that already do a fine job of offering a host of new spells and magic items for assassin characters. We felt no need to recreate the wheel by creating a bunch of new magic items and spells that simply duplicate effects already available to the player.<br/><br/>"}, "60664": {"rpg": {"524": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Gods of the Dead", "rpgproducer": {"31060": "Julie Hedge"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2773212.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"15398": "PDF Version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"3877": "The Mythos Series"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2773212_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>Gods of the Dead presents four new completely open game content deities of death and undeath that can be dropped into virtually any d20-style campaign setting.

I dreamed of compiling a collection such as this, but since each wizard&rsquo;s arcane writings are different, such mass production was difficult. Until now. Thanks to a revolutionary spell notation system you can easily prepare spells directly from this book without transferring it to your own book. If you enjoyed this volume, you may wish to pick up a copy of my previous text, Fifty New Ways to Blow Stuff Up, and keep you eyes peeled for future installments.<br/><br/>"}, "60697": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic657061.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"41342": {"name": "Esa Wiik"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"52236": "Aki Raula"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"16230": {"name": "Mindwarrior Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic657061_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1008": {"name": "Nautical"}}, "description": "Atlantic Triangle is a trading game for 2 - 5 players, who travel the seas as captains of merchant fleets in the dawn of the 18th century.<br/><br/>The Atlantic Ocean and the three continents conjoined by it lay the scene for fierce competition for money and power.

Its children could as easily save a forest, as burn one down. Living embodiments of nature have often been portrayed as either avid protectors or reclusive and dangerous hermits. This has been especially true of sentient plant species. However, most of all, nature is unpredictable. Perhaps it was in this spirit the oaklings were born. When the first oaklings marched inexplicably from the forest, the tree huggers cheered a new ally. After all, oaklings have all the hallmarks of a friend of the wood; being basically medium sized living trees with green leafy faces. However, the oaklings cared little for conservation. In fact, it was quite the opposite. Oaklings are an industrious species that has little regard for sentiment or emotion. Coldly logical, the oaklings took up branch to their own cause; the betterment of themselves. Like nature, they are not inherently good or evil; they could as easily take up sides with a goodly king as they could a deplorable dictator.

Published in Japan and written in Japanese, it is an area movement wargame focused on armored combat in 1944-45.<br/><br/>The game consists of three maps (two sheets printed front and back), cardboard counters, a rulebook and four unpainted PVC tanks (Tiger II, Panther, Hetzer and StuG IIIG).  The maps depict the Normandy beaches, Remagen and Budapest.  Counters depict armored vehicles for Germany, U.K., U.S.A., and U.S.S.R.<br/><br/>The game is a light wargame centered around the abstract depiction of armored combat in Europe late in the war.  Obviously the intent of the game designers is for the players to equip themselves with World Tank Museum forces to use on the maps; the first four vehicles (all German) are a means to jump-start these forces.  As these are generally insufficient, the included cardboard counters, which carry the attack strength, defense strength, movement value, etc., for the forces, can be used.<br/><br/>WTD II is a successor to WTD I, but is not exactly an expansion.  Some minor changes to the forces have been made- e.g., point values for the units (which are used to build armies in design-your-own scenarios) have been adjusted.  However, several new factors are introduced, such as the inclusion of infantry, anti-tank guns, armored personnel carriers, and rules for indirect fire/air strikes.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "name": "Panzertales: World Tank Division II", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "average": "4", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "1", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "expands": {"41535": {"name": "Panzertales: World Tank Division I"}}, "age": "0"}, "60806": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Gram Cram", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1976", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic600681_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"20": {"name": "Milton Bradley"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic600681.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1094": {"name": "Educational"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Exciting game of Metric conversions!<br/><br/>"}, "60807": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic600678.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"7971": {"name": "Samuel Lowe Co."}}, "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic600678_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "description": "Spin and move game based on the classic story.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"248659": "First Edition"}, "average": "0", "name": "The Game of the Three Bears", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "age": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4665": "Children's Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"7265": "Animals: Bears"}}, "60808": {"rpgitemversion": {"15481": "2.1.1 Edition"}, "poll": {}, "name": "O Casamento (Tagmar II Edition)", "rpgproducer": {"24053": "Geliard Roberto Barbosa"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic596077.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpg": {"2439": "Tagmar II"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"3609": "Aventuras Prontas"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic596077_t.jpg", "description": "Translated from the book introduction:<br/><br/>The story has four distinct scenarios.

Merchants wrestle over a few extra coppers' profit, while the nobles (most of whom were merchants not long ago) vie for power. Filty urchins clog the streets of the Bullrushes while the penitent file into dusty temples, and nobles while away their time and money at secretive clubs like the Knife's Point. There are vast opportunities for profit in Talon, some legitimate and many planned in shadow.<br/><br/>Talon is a sandbox setting, appropriate for any fantasy-style game. It's urban but medieval/Renaissance in technology; general enough to be easily inserted into any pre-industrial setting.<br/><br/>With this document, you get 27 separate locations in the city, each described in detail; 34 NPCs, each with a personal motto, background, and defined personality; 10 full-color maps; 2 pages of campaign and quest ideas; and a solid understanding of Talon's history, physical location, major vices, organizations, political situation, etc. Of the 34 NPCs, the most important 14 have been completely and separately statted out for the D&amp;D 4E, D&amp;D 3.5, and GURPS systems.

After the movement, the player has either reached a special field of the board or gets to draw a random encounter card. This may be an item to pick up or an enemy that must be overcome. At the special fields, keys may be collected or allied spirits recruited.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved with a special die, which is rolled alternately by the player and by the enemy. Depending on the roll of this die, the rolling party may regain health, inflict damage or invoke special powers. These powers allow to deal more damage, regain health, collect treasure after victory etc. Each player and each enemy has three such powers, and the die roll determines which is used.<br/><br/>During the game, players collect rewards like gems and tokens that increase their fighting power. They may also increase their power by recruiting an allied spirit.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to collect four keys and open the treasure vault. To collect a key, a coin must be tossed when a key field of the board is reached. The coin is made of cardboard and shows either YES or NO. If the NO side comes up, the action fails and no key is found. The same mechanic is used to check if the treasure vault can be opened once it is reached with four keys - if this fails, four new keys must be collected to retry.<br/><br/>To hinder the success of the other players, mines can be used. These represent small traps of different type. If a player walks across such a mine - represented by a small cardboard chit - the mine may e.g. destroy equipment.<br/><br/>Rules are in English, German and Russian.<br/><br/>"}, "60872": {"boardgamedesigner": {"7823": {"name": "Michele Comerci"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Rio Grande", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2002": "Tile Placement"}, "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "39", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic598767_t.jpg", "average": "5.83077", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"22": {"name": "Piatnik"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic598767.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"166167": "French edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1086": {"name": "Territory Building"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Rio Grande is a card game whereby players use their cards to create rivers and score points through building bridges.

It is refreshingly delicious and fun. There is a certain adrenaline rush that surges through my veins whenever I vanquish an adventurer or paladin that has had the audacity to challenge me or invade my home. Nothing is more satisfying than dashing the hopes and beliefs of a holy cleric when he finds out that his god doesn&rsquo;t really care about him or to see the look of surprise on the face of a rogue as I catch him unaware and deliver a mortal blow. <br/><br/>Being evil means you command the respect of others. They may hate you, fear you, vilify you, and even dare to oppose you, but they will acknowledge the power you wield and the control you exert. With a simple wave of my hand or nod of my head, I condemn a person to a lifetime of torture or a quick death, depending upon my mood. I can enslave anyone upon a whim or allow him to just pass beneath my notice. Even fiends and infernal creatures seek me out to form pacts and agreements that will benefit both parties. Through careful manipulations I have caused wars between kingdoms and then rode in with my armies in the aftermath to claim rule. Being evil means you strive for a single ultimate goal; absolute power.<br/><br/>Absolute power means none can oppose you. All you desire is within your grasp. Those foolish enough to oppose you or stand between your goals are destroyed as an example to all others who harbor such rebellious thoughts. Power is everything. It is what drives your very soul.&rdquo; <br/>-- Shi&rsquo;Kahr Darkstarr, Lord of Tonaga<br/><br/>Welcome to Gothos and the realms of the Dark Walkers.
