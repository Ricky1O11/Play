This is a noted confectioner in the Ishikawa prefecture in Japan, and the shapes and designs of their sweets are special. The game designer was given permission to use the Kaichin name (it means marble chip) and designs in this game. The game comes with Japanese and English rules.<br/><br/>The game itself is a simple abstract game. Players are secretly dealt cards corresponding to two of the 12 sweets in the game, and another card for one of the 6 colours. You win by moving a specific Kaichin chip that you have the card for across the board to its destination.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the game ends when there are no more available spaces on the board (some empty spaces might be blocked). In that case, the player holding the colour card with the most colour chips on the board wins. The tie breaker is the player furthest clockwise from the start player.<br/><br/>On your turn, you may either move any Kaichin chip, or make an attack. Kaichin chips can move one space (not occupied by another Kaichin chip) and then you place a matching colour chip under it. A Kaichin chip can leapfrog a single adjacent Kaichin chip, but cannot move onto or over any Damage chips. A Kaichin chip can move two spaces, if the first space has a colour chip of its colour. If a Kaichin chip ends on a colour chip of the wrong colour, that gets swapped out.<br/><br/>Damage chips are placed when an Attack occurs. If they hold the matching Kaichin card, a player simply declares a Kaichin chip is the attacker, and damage is assessed in 1 of the 6 directions around the attacker. Only the first Kaichin chip on a line that is vulnerable suffers damage. A Kaichin chip under attack is flipped to show a black border and a black damage chip is swapped under it. If a Kaichin chip suffers two damages in the game, it is eliminated. Kaichin chips not in play yet are immune but cannot attack. Damage chips are never removed.<br/><br/>During the game, nobody declares ownership of any Kaichin chip. During an attack, the player making the attack simply damages the target Kaichin.

Vault is named after pole vaulting, which is a track and field event in which a person uses a long, flexible pole as an aid to jump over a bar. Vault is a derivative of Onager, by the same designer and uses a variation of its jumping mechanism (also present in Billabong, for example) that allows multiple directions to be used. It&rsquo;s like vector movement but without acceleration. Unlike Onager, Vault only works well on a square grid, as jumping directions are difficult to visualize in a hexagonal grid.<br/><br/>MATERIAL<br/><br/>- A square grid with an even number of cells (recommended 10x10). Preferably checkered* for clarity, but this is not mandatory.<br/>- As many white and black pawns as the number of cells per side.<br/><br/>SETUP<br/><br/>Each player has an allocated colour (Black or White). Fill your nearest row with pawns of your colour (one per cell).<br/> HOW TO PLAY<br/><br/>White starts. Players alternate turns during the game until the victory condition is reached. On your turn, either walk or jump with one of your pawns.<br/><br/>Walk<br/><br/>Move one of your pieces to an adjacent empty space as a King in Chess.<br/><br/>Jump<br/><br/>In order to jump, choose 2 friendly pieces. One of the pieces then jumps over the other piece in the direction defined by both pawns, landing on a space beyond that is at a distance equal to the distance between the two friendly pieces before the jump was made (like a mirror). Notice that jumping is not restricted to orthogonal or diagonal directions.<br/><br/>The landing space must be either empty or occupied by an enemy piece, which is then captured and removed from the game. A piece cannot land on a friendly piece. Pieces cannot land outside the board.<br/><br/>Notice that the spaces between the jumping pawn and the landing space don&rsquo;t need to be empty. Also, captures can only be made by jumping.<br/><br/>GAME END<br/><br/>If at the start of your turn you have at least one piece on your opponent's back rank then you have won.<br/><br/>If the above condition is not reached and you can&rsquo;t make a legal movement at the start of your turn, you lose. This rarely happens. Players may agree on a draw at any moment during the game.<br/><br/>NOTES FROM THE DESIGNER<br/><br/>This is intended to be the simplest game that uses this jumping mechanism. I&rsquo;ve decided not to use Onager&rsquo;s stacking mechanism (in order to make is simpler for turn based online play and also playable with non-stacking pieces) or the multiple jump (as it would be almost impossible to think ahead).<br/><br/>As a variant, you can use the stacking mechanism of Onager.<br/><br/>(*) On a checkered board, the jumping piece always lands in a space of the same colour as the starting one.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"314883": "Nestorgames first edition"}, "average": "7.40588", "name": "Vault", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2078": "Point to Point Movement"}, "age": "10", "usersrated": "17", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"26432": "Combinatorial"}}, "186408": {"boardgamedesigner": {"57119": {"name": "Hadi Barkat"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Matchmaster", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2009": "Trick-taking"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "7", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3382095_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4269": {"name": "moses.

A hand of Poker betting takes place, with bets added to the &quot;Poker&quot; pot, and the winner wins the &quot;Poker&quot; pot.

If a player can move one of his pieces so that it jumps over an adjacent piece of their opponent and into an empty space, that player captures the opponent's disc. Jumping moves must be taken when possible, thereby creating a strategy game where players offer up jumps in exchange for setting up the board so that they jump even more pieces on their turn.

Each player is the all-powerful shaman of a tribe of ferocious, conniving, vicious little cannibals called zimbies, and each player has a single goal: to become the new Cannibal King. To achieve their goal, each player will have to use their zimbies to infiltrate the current King&rsquo;s compound, kill him, take his Crown, and carry it safely to their tribal board before a rival zimby tribe can do so first.<br/><br/>In solo play, the player must use their zimbies, scrolls, and strategy to defeat the Cannibal King, evade his thugs, and bring the Cannibal Crown to their tribal board before time runs out. In a multiplayer game, the players must work together to gain access to the Cannibal King&rsquo;s sanctum before they can confront him. Once they kill the King, however, it&rsquo;s every tribe for itself and the player that reaches their tribal board with the King&rsquo;s Crown immediately becomes the new Cannibal King and wins the game!<br/><br/>Keep one eye on the Crown.  Keep the other on your back.<br/><br/>WHAT'S A ZIMBY?<br/>Zimbies are vicious, conniving little cannibals.  They are small, stubborn, anti-heroes in a game of control of a land of nasty little creatures.  They are not human: each zimby tribe has followed its own cultural and evolutionary path -- there are humanoid zimbies, avian zimbies, aquatic zimbies, simian zimbies, ursine zimbies, arachnid zimbies, the list goes on!  That's why there's a bunch of reptilian-eyed, orange-skinned, clawed, stick-haired creatures on the box!  The name &quot;zimby&quot; itself derives from a play on words on the word &quot;zombie&quot; and the designer's love of the cartoon character Invader Zim, who he feels exquisitely exemplifies zimby behavior and fanaticism.<br/><br/>MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CONCEPTS AND ELEMENTS<br/>Each player plays the shaman of a different zimby tribe.  Zimbies are nasty, unruly, conniving little cannibals that follow their shaman with fanatical loyalty.  Each player&rsquo;s goal is to bring about the death of the Cannibal King, steal his fallen Crown, and get the Crown to his tribal board so he can become the new Cannibal King.  To do this, the players will have to:<br/><br/>1. Get some zimbies onto the main game board (you can&rsquo;t get the Crown without a zimby to grab it and carry it home),<br/>2. Cooperate with at least one other tribe to activate a sigil (you can&rsquo;t kill the King unless you can get to him),<br/>3. Kill the Cannibal King (that&rsquo;s the only way he will give up his Crown),<br/>4. Get the Crown and deliver it to your tribal board (you win the game by becoming the new Cannibal King).<br/><br/>Part 1 of the game is completely cooperative.  Part 2 of the game is completely competitive.<br/><br/>CREATURES<br/>There are four creature types in the game: zimbies, obnoxious little cannibals that do a shaman&rsquo;s bidding with ruthless (sometimes inept) fanaticism; zombies, undead meat-puppets; thugs, the Cannibal King&rsquo;s dim-witted, fervently devoted brutes; the Cannibal King, the sadistic yet cowardly overlord of the zimby tribes. Shaman are players and don&rsquo;t count as creatures.<br/><br/>MOJO<br/>Mojo is &quot;a power that may seem magical and allows someone to be very effective, successful, etc.&quot; (Mirriam Webster).  It is the inexplicable, mystical energy than allows shamans to both impel their zimbies into action and release the powerful magical spells bound in the scrolls they raid from the Scroll Library!  But be warned, mojo is drawn from shamans and zimbies!  The more zimbies a shaman sends forth to kill the Cannibal King and steal his Crown, the less mojo that shaman has available!  Every turn, each player (shaman) generates a small amount of mojo and may also draw forth mojo from zimbies on their tribal board, thereby depleting them of energy for the remainder of the turn and rendering them useless. A shaman may also cannibalize (yes, eat!) their own zimbies for more mojo... Of course, eaten zimbies are dead and gone...<br/><br/>STACKING<br/>Multiple zimbies can stack to form columns which count as single, giant creatures.  The more zimbies in the stack, the stronger they are but the slower they move.  And the shaman whose turn it is fully controls the column...<br/><br/>SCROLLS, MOVEMENT, AND COMBAT<br/>Shamans may use mojo to empower scrolls to cast one-off rituals, long-lasting incantations, and blindingly fast witcheries.  These cast magical effects -- beneficial and detrimental -- on the shaman themselves.  Shamans also use mojo to move their zimbies on the main board -- so, the more scrolls a shaman uses the less mojo they have available for movement. Combat is a simple 1d6 &quot;roll-off&quot; with the combatant making the higher die roll dealing a number of wounds damage equal to the difference in the die rolls to the combatant making the lower die roll.<br/><br/>TIMING<br/>Many of a player's actions are limited to the player's turn, such as spawning new zimbies, turning zimbies into zombies, movement and combat.  Players may extract and use mojo at any time on any player's turn.  So, scroll use is always an option!<br/><br/>FIRST MOVER STRATEGY<br/>At the end of the round, after all the players have gone, the player with the most undepleted zimbies on his tribal board becomes the first mover on the next round.  That player goes first and play proceeds clockwise from them.<br/><br/>SOLO<br/>There is also a solo mode, which is not only a fully realized game but also very useful to hone the strategies that you will use in your multiplayer games. But be warned: solo play is limited to 12 turns and your score gets lower the more turns you take.  It's not too hard to win, but it's tough to get a high score!<br/><br/>HAVE FUN WREAKING HAVOC!<br/><br/>"}, "186436": {"boardgamedesigner": {"26621": {"name": "Madoka Kitao"}}, "average": "5.375", "poll": {}, "name": "Ten Cats", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2002": "Tile Placement"}, "yearpublished": "2015", "boardgameimplementation": {"130677": "Jushimatsu"}, "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "3", "boardgamefamily": {"4220": "n in a row"}, "boardgameartist": {"86290": "Hajung Lee"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"23599": {"name": "UBO CnC"}}, "boardgameversion": {"288455": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "4", "minplaytime": "5", "description": "Every player has ten tiles in his bag.

The other players, the human bounty hunters, must discover and kill the monster before they are hunted down by the creature. Each player moves around the mansion's many rooms to search for clues, gather items, and target other players to deduce which of them is the monster (or, if you are the monster, to wound the other bounty hunters). Tread lightly, for the hunt has begun...<br/><br/>Each round, players take turns moving about the mansion's many rooms, looking at cards for clues, and picking up items (cards) to add to their hand. Players can also interact when in the same room as another player and try to attack them using the cards in their hand in order to deduce who is the monster and what kind of monster they are. If you are the monster, then you want to do your best to avoid being killed and wound the other players in hopes to escape the mansion with your life. Play continues until either the monster is slain or all the other players declare that they have been crippled.<br/><br/>"}, "186462": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2788750.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"71089": {"name": "Tom Stasiak"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": {"26034": {"name": "Beautiful Disaster Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2788750_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "150", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "description": "This deck contains a bunch of fun cards of different types, which adds more variety to the existing decks.

Go indicates success, No-Go indicates failure.

Aptitudes are assigned narrative levels of Inferior, Average, or Superior.  These three narrative levels correspond to the green, blue, and red die, respectively.  Characters have Skills which are rated as Untrained, Familiar, Qualified, Trained, or Expert.  Tasks are assigned a difficulty of Routine, Standard, Hard, or Oscar Sierra.  Skills and Tasks are cross referenced on a &quot;Universal Task Matrix&quot; yielding a number of Go/No-Go results required for outcomes of Golf Sierra, Unsatisfactory, Satisfactory, Excellent, or Outstanding.

The GM is referred to as the Designated Dry Guy and makes all the critical decisions (optional rules may change this).  Players select characters from common media (e.g., &quot;Marge from The Simpsons&quot;), a stereotype (e.g., &quot;the nymphomaniac peasant girl&quot;) or just make them up.<br/><br/>The game proceeds by characters stating what they want to have happen in the narrative and the Designated Dry Guy assigning an alcohol amount to effect the event; the player then consumes the alcohol amount determined and play proceeds.  Routine inter-player conflicts can be resolved by drinking or by using one of several methods described in the rules, including:  21, Fuzzy Duck, Pattern Game, Rhyme and Reason, Shooting Animals, Word Association, or Word Disassociation.  Alternately, players can engage in any mutually agreed upon contest such as arm wrestling, doing something weird with their bodies, or flipping beer coasters.<br/><br/>Treasure is represented by alcohol that is distributed from the party store to the finding character's player.  The rules include notes on drinking etiquette and British/American terminology involving alcohol topics (&quot;4 gills in a pint&quot;).<br/><br/>"}, "186465": {"boardgamedesigner": {"86271": {"name": "\u5411\u4e95\u3000\u771f\u4eba (Mahito Mukai)"}}, "average": "6", "poll": {}, "name": "Goshuin Atsume", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2718654_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"86271": "\u5411\u4e95\u3000\u771f\u4eba (Mahito Mukai)"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"30779": {"name": "Puninokai"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2718654.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"288503": "Japanese first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "User summary: <br/>\u5fa1\u6731\u5370\u3042\u3064\u3081 (Goshuin Atsume) means Goshuin Collection in English.

Presently, Goshuin is a popular souvenir among people visiting temples.<br/><br/>In this game, the players visit temples and offer copied sutras to collect Goshuin. You may choose to form connection with many Bodhisattva deities or deepen the connection with certain deities. The player who manages to achieve the highest score through such connection wins the game!<br/><br/>Goshuin Collection is a bidding and hand management game for 3 to 4 players.<br/>The box with words written in Indian ink contains components, such as Goshuin cards, Sutra chips, and Goshuin Notebook boards. 29 Goshuin cards and the Sutra chips are in a Buddhist monk&rsquo;s own handwriting. The original Goshuin Notebook boards were made to order by Aribundou, a long-established bookbinder which has been in business since the Meiji period.<br/><br/>After drawing a Goshuin card from the draw pile, players offer their sutras. Once all the players have taken their turn, the player who has offered the longest sutra receives the Goshuin. Place the Goshuin you've received in lines next to your Goshuin Notebook board. You can also score substantially by collecting the Goshuin of certain deities!<br/><br/>But watch out for non-Goshuin cards which have slipped in!

However, while all the interest groups want to maximize positive impact, they all have different priorities for how to go about it. Are you advocating clean energy, habitat protection, or island nations that might get flooded? Will you pass laws to create subsidies, institute a carbon tax, or maybe attempt an ambitious geo-engineering project? Every method has its own benefits and drawbacks, and you will need strategic planning and political cunning to lead your organization to success.<br/><br/>Mechanics:<br/>Players attempt to pass bills into law, both to have an impact in general and to further their own special interest's goals. However, all players will need to pursue a mixed strategy to succeed -- your special interest does not dictate your strategy. For example, a player might be rewarded for seeing enough geo-engineer projects succeed, regardless of who plays those cards -- so they might play those cards themselves or negotiate for someone else to play them.<br/><br/>Carbon Copy Politics uses a novel &quot;clock&quot; mechanic to track the progress of activities over time. Players play cards onto the clock, which ticks down each turn. Cards that reach the end of the clock resolve, building variable delays into the play of every card. The delay requires players to plan ahead, allow them to set up combos, and creates opportunities for disruption by opponents. For example, bill cards are typically delayed by 3 turns before they are evaluated, so you might play it one turn, play an action to boost public will-for-change the next turn, play a modifier on it the next turn, and then discard cards as the bill resolves to pay the rest of the cost.<br/><br/>Bill cards are rated by their difficulty (cost) and impact (score). Different types of bills offer different ways to pay the cost. Carbon Tax bills get easier to pass as more taxes are passes, while Cap and Trade bills are easier if several are played at the same time by different players.<br/><br/>"}, "186040": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Attack of the Big Green Munchy Things", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"287840": "Web Browser Edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2351": "Puzzle"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2407": "Maze"}, "videogameplatform": {"5084": "Web Browser"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Use your mouse to draw lines to guide your spaceship through space to save the astronauts from the Big Green Munchy Things<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "186042": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Mad Virus", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"287842": "Web Browser Edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2351": "Puzzle"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2165": "Puzzle"}, "videogameplatform": {"5084": "Web Browser"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Be the mastermind behind rapidly growing viruses.<br/><br/>Grow a Virus that covers the board before you run out of moves. the cells with the eyes are controlled by you.<br/>After choosing a color with the buttons at the left your virus will expand to the cells of the chosen color that are in direct contact with controlled cells.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "186043": {"poll": {}, "name": "Monopoly: Copa Mundial de la Fifa Brasil 2014", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamefamily": {"100": "Monopoly"}, "average": "4", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"51": {"name": "Hasbro"}}, "boardgameversion": {"287843": "Latin American edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "Esta nueva versi&oacute;n del cl&aacute;sico Monopoly incluye dentro de su tablero a 22 de las 32 selecciones que participaron en la Copa del Mundo: Brasil, Colombia, Espa&ntilde;a, Argentina, Alemania, Italia, Holanda, Portugal, Uruguay, Francia, Chile, Inglaterra, Estados Unidos, Rusia, Nigeria, Jap&oacute;n, M&eacute;xico, Ecuador, Camer&uacute;n, Corea del Sur, Costa Rica, y Honduras.<br/>Monopoly Copa Mundial de la FIFA Brasil 2014 incluye: Tablero con las 22 selecciones, 6 fichas con dise&ntilde;os alusivos al mundial, 28 tarjetas de t&iacute;tulo de propiedad, 16 tarjetas fuleco y 16 tarjetas trofeo, 1 paquete de dinero, 32 casas, 12 hoteles y 2 dados.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Version of Monopoly themed on the 2014 Fifa World Cup, including competing nations in place of the traditional coloured property sets, stadia in place of the stations and half time/full time cards instead of the chance/community chest cards."}, "186044": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Connect-It", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"287844": "Web Browser Edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2351": "Puzzle"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2749": "Point-and-Click"}, "videogameplatform": {"5084": "Web Browser"}, "poll": {}, "description": "This puzzle game is similar to Mah Jongg in some ways, but different in others.

You go in number order according to your player order cards. You drop your player order cards from shoulder height, number side up, in an attempt to completely cover a bug. Bugs range in size and value. The bigger the bug, the more points it is worth. Beware though, because if your player order card lands boot side up someone can cover your number and take one of your squished bugs from you. You squish the bug and your friend steps on your toes and takes it from you. This could turn a win into a loss or a loss into a win.  Getting 10 points is easy, keeping them is tough.

It includes Hive: Original, Venom, Swarm, Predators, Guardians and Honeycombo.<br/><br/>Hive: Venom &ndash; Includes all the original pieces in addition to some new creatures on the reverse sides. You must decide which face up to place the pieces depending on the current state of the board and your future plans. You can flip the pieces but this will cost you a tempo. The new pieces are designed not to over power the Originals be rather to compliment them and present the player with more strategic choices.<br/><br/>Hive: Swarm &ndash; A mode of play which adds in a little bit of randomness to Hive and challenges the player to make the best use of the hand they are dealt. It can be played with Hive Original or any of the expansions and even allows you to place your opponent's pieces!<br/><br/>Hive: Predators &ndash; Introduces some powerful pieces with killer moves which can permanently remove an opponent's creatures from the Hive. It also introduces the alternative victory condition of removing your opponent's Queen Bee which encourages even more interesting ways to play and the greater possibility to come back from a losing position.<br/><br/>Hive: Guardians &ndash; Dominate the top of the Hive with these high flying creatures. You now have to fully surround the Queen Bee so even the top must be covered to win. They can also be very useful in neutralising some of the new expansions when playing with all the expansions together.<br/><br/>Hive: Honeycombo &ndash; This piece is shared by both players which allows you sacrifice your current turn in order to then play two moves in your next turn. This opens up many new possibilities such as being able to place and move a piece without it getting pinned, or moving two pieces in to surround the Queen without your opponent being able to move one away with the Pillbug.<br/><br/>Please see attached files for the rules and print and play stickers.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"288046": "First edition"}, "name": "Hive Colony (fan expansion for Hive)", "playingtime": "0", "average": "6.66667", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "3", "expands": {"2655": {"name": "Hive"}}, "age": "9"}, "186177": {"rpgitemversion": {"288057": "ASCII Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Iconoclast Mini-Ruleset", "rpgproducer": {"13496": "Michael Fiegel"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2705747.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"28574": "Iconoclast"}, "rpgcategory": {"2622": "Quick Start / Fast Play Rules"}, "rpggenre": {"183": "Science Fiction"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2705747_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>The mini-ruleset you are looking at now is designed to be an introduction to the world of Iconoclast and the FORGE system.

The core rules detail a method of card handling that is used to resolve all actions (opposed or unopposed) and combat.  Every rule besides the Card rules is considered optional.<br/><br/>The card game has a deck and a discard pile for played cards.  Characters start the adventure with seven cards.  Cards in standard rank, ace high, are scored 2 through 15.  A joker, when played, results in two cards drawn from the deck and summed to provide a score--then all three cards are discarded; e.g., results may be really good or really bad.  The GM also has a hand for NPCs.  Resolution first establishes a difficulty and then cards of those involved are played face down and revealed simultaneously.  The action may require another card draw.<br/><br/>Imaginality uses the hackneyed concept that characters are intended to be &quot;yourself&quot;, or, the player.

You don&rsquo;t even require a conductor; the integrated rotary disk will lead you through the different rhythm patterns which you can choose for yourself. Different symbols for the disk ensure diversified rhythms and suspense for your games. The winner of Biff Baff will be the one who can keep the beat going the longest and is thus crowned the new drumming king. The whole game is made of wood which ensures stability and persistency. Playing the game will improve your sense of rhythm and helps building social skills for children starting at the age of three.<br/><br/>Game Explanation.<br/>The gaming board is divided into four colored sections which gives up to four players the opportunity to drum at the same time. Every section is imprinted with one blue and two red hand symbols which mark the two sounds (bass, snare). Additionally there is a white arrow which points towards the middle to the rotary disk. This disk fulfills the position of the conductor during the game. Up to six magnets can be placed on the disk which symbolize different activities like playing the bass drum or snapping one&rsquo;s fingers.

Mal mag ein Abenteurer f&uuml;r einen Baumskorpion nur eine appetitliche Erweiterung seines Speiseplans sein, mal kann ein Satyr eine ganze Gruppe Reisender vor eine gr&ouml;&szlig;ere Aufgabe stellen.

Die lorakischen Besonderheiten von Vampiren und Werbestien, und wie sie mit derlei Fl&uuml;chen und Krankheiten am Spieltisch umgehen, werden ebenfalls in einem eigenen Kapitel behandelt.

The object of the game is to gain the most points by travelling various routes (detailed in coffins instead of rail spaces)and outwitting other players. You will need the train pieces and the train cards from either the US or Europe base games (or you can buy them from the Days of Wonder shop). You can use stations if you wish.<br/><br/>There is an extra set of cards for the cities, each with a value to be earned by visiting that city. These cards are dealt/picked up alongwith tickets in the same quantity and with the same 'keep/dispose' rules. Some of the cards give you extra facilities to complete your tickets. There are also up to 9 bonuses for the end-of-game scoring.<br/><br/>The board does not have any grey tracks or parallel tracks, though there are limited selective options for the latter.

This version contains no board.<br/><br/>BEZZERWIZZER Kompakt is a new way to play BEZZERWIZZER that makes it easier to play on the go, at the beach or anywhere else for that sake.<br/><br/>The game contains 150 cards with questions in the same 20 categories as the original game, which means that they can be used as new challenges in the original game as well.<br/><br/>To start with the players are divided into two to six teams. Each team can consist of one or more players. Each team then gets a bezzerwizzer token that can be used once per round (see below).<br/><br/>Now the game starts: Each team picks a token at random out of the included bag. There are 20 tokens - one for each category in the game. The token must be kept secret from the other players. The first team to go then choose either to answer a question in the category on their token or to swap with one of the other teams, without knowing what they will get. If they answer the question that they end up with correctly, they will receive 3 points - a wrong answer does nothing. Scoring is kept on the included pad. This continues till all teams have answered a question. The last team will not have the opportunity to swap, as all other teams have used up their categories.<br/><br/>Each turn, each of the teams have one opportunity to bezzerwizze one of the other teams question. This means that if the team does not answer the question correctly, the team that has bezzerwizze'd has a chance to answer it as well. If the first team answers correctly however, the other team will have wasted their chance to bezzerwizze this round. The number of points you get for bezzerwizzing and answering correct depends on when you choose to do it; if you choose to bezzerwizze after the category is revealed, but before the question is read aloud you will get 2 points for a correct answer. If you do it after the question has been read aloud, you will only get 1 point for a correct answer. If the teams that bezzerwizzet can not answer correctly either, the original team will receive the points.<br/><br/>The turn order then switches one place and the process starts again. If there are fewer category tokens in the bag than the number of teams when a new turn is started, all of the tokens are returned to the bag.<br/><br/>The game ends when one of the teams has 20 points (continuing the round to completion to allow other teams to reach 20 as well).

These evils are no less a threat than the ones that most adventurers face, but many PCs are ill-equipped to deal with them.

Included are the society&rsquo;s judge, an inquisitor archetype that focuses on clandestine investigation and mob fighting tactics, the mind criminal, a mesmerist archetype that implants rebellious thoughts in those around him and creates dangerous sleeper agents, the political assassin, a slayer archetype who makes political statements with her high-profile kills, the conjurer of riots, a summoner archetype that conjures aggressive&mdash;and often explosive&mdash;creatures, and the subversion specialist, a wizard archetype that specializes in casting spells unnoticed.<br/><br/>Whether you're about to embark on a politically-themed campaign (such as the official Paizo adventure path focusing on revolution), or you just want a selection of exciting new abilities for passionate and freedom-loving PCs, this book has lots of tantalizing options to offer.

Unit movement and other actions are limited to the cost of a unit&rsquo;s available Actions Points during each turn phase, as determined during a turn order's sequence of play.<br/><br/>The basic command level is the brigade (consisting of several infantry battalions, cavalry squadrons and/or artillery batteries).  At the end of a turn, one or more Brigade Morale roll(s) are made to determine that brigade's willingness to continue the fight (number of rolls is based on the number of units destroyed or currently in &quot;bad order&quot;).  The roll(s) determine if that Commander retreats 1 or more squares.  The command radius (in squares) is always determined from the respective brigade commander's position or unit objective square (if orders achieved). If a unit starts a turn within &quot;Command Radius,&quot; it allows the unit to be issued an order cube, otherwise it must use all of its movement for the turn to try and get back in command.  An experienced player can control a division or corps with little difficulty after only playing the game a couple of times.<br/><br/>Players provide their own miniatures and terrain, using any size scale and basing of miniatures (generally 6mm to 28mm range).  The general rule figure scale is based upon a 60:1 scale for infantry/Cavalry.  The gaming area can be marked by various methods to show grid square designated areas.  An optional grided gaming mat can be used as the terrain base.<br/><br/>The initial release of the rules covers the campaign conflict between France and Austria in 1809 (but other nation units from different theaters of operation and time frames fought can easily be adapted for play).

However, each treasure has a special negative effect that makes your collection vulnerable. Steal wisely, certain combinations of treasures in your possession could make it easier for other thieves to steal from you.<br/><br/>The main mechanic of Pick the Lock has a small amount of wit and a lot of luck. Players attempt to steal treasures from each other or the vault by using one of their five number cards. These cards are numbered four through eight. When played they define the odds of success during your attempt to steal a treasure. The defending player sets the combination of the lock to his or her vault by placing a card face down that is from 1 to the number the attacking player has played. Using the right cards with the right treasure effects could ensure your victory. Pick the Lock combines a nice blend of strategy, wit, and luck.

In Tavarua you are a surfer in a surf contest. You'll need to pick a board, paddle out, look for waves, and ride them in to score points!<br/><br/>Tavarua is played over a number of short rounds. In each round waves advance towards shore, players simultaneously select then resolve actions by playing cards, and a wave card is revealed and resolved. Rounds continue until there are no more wave cards in the wave deck, at which point the game ends and one player claims victory.<br/><br/>Goal<br/>The goal of the game is to win the grand champion trophy, by having the highest scoring waves. You score points by catching and riding waves, but you may only keep your top two wave scores for each board type. General gameplay involves looking for a wave to ride, paddling to the wave, catching the wave, riding the wave, then scoring the wave. When the game ends, three trophies are given out, whoever gets the Grand Champion trophy wins!<br/><br/>Looking For a Wave<br/>At the start of each round all the wave tiles advance one space towards the shore. When looking for a wave to catch, you&rsquo;ll need to remember that you can only catch a broken wave. Waves are either unbroken, or broken. Waves with a die number less than their space in the break are unbroken. Waves with a die number equal to or higher than their space in the break are broken.<br/><br/>Paddling to a Wave<br/>Paddling moves your surfer in the channel. You can play any card to paddle, the number on the card determines how many spaces you move.<br/><br/>Catching a Wave<br/>You can only catch the wave that&rsquo;s in the same space in the break as your surfer is in the channel. To catch a wave, you&rsquo;ll need to play a card. The number and direction on the card will shift your balance. When catching a wave you&rsquo;ll want to look at the top card of the wave deck to determine which card to play. You want to play a card that will shift your balance so that you do not wipeout during the Wave / Score phase. You now move your surfer/surfboard onto the wave tile (standing your surfer up) and finally move your played card over to your score pile.<br/><br/>Riding a Wave<br/>Once you&rsquo;ve caught a wave you are considered to be riding it. While riding, your goal is to maintain your balance, while maximizing scored points. Cards you play will both shift your balance, and count as your score for the wave. The higher the number on the card, the more points it&rsquo;s worth, however the more difficult it will be to maintain your balance. After you play and shift your balance, a wave card will be revealed, and it too will shift your balance. Be careful: if your balance token moves one or more spaces off the nose or tail of your surfboard, you&rsquo;ll wipeout!<br/><br/>Scoring a Wave <br/>When riding a wave: cards played are not discarded, but placed into your score pile. The numbers on the cards determines the score value of that wave. When you stop riding a wave you will score it during the &ldquo;Wave / Score&rdquo; phase of that round. To score a wave take one of your color score tokens, with the board you&rsquo;re currently riding, and place it on score track at the number equal to your wave score point value, then discard all the cards/tokens in your score pile.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"299742": "Collector's Edition"}, "age": "13", "name": "Tavarua", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "average": "7.55678", "usersrated": "245", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "186324": {"boardgamedesigner": {"69790": {"name": "John A.

Only a few noble heroes can help the order of the Stewards protect their knowledge. Take up arms with Seer Kel and her fellow heroes or reveal forbidden knowledge to call the ferrox to your side in Stewards of the Secret.<br/><br/><br/>Stewards of the Secret is a Hero and Monster Collection for Descent: Journeys in the Dark.<br/><br/>It contains<br/><br/>     four heroes<br/>     three blood apes<br/>     three nagas<br/>     four ferrox<br/>     two new quests<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Seer Kel has an extraordinarily powerful hero ability: figures and obstacles never block her line of sight. With Seer Kel, you can always find the spaces between bodies to ensure your attacks strike home. Even as you use your unnatural sight to look past those who would stand in your way, you may gaze into the future and see what plans the overlord player has in store for the heroes. As your heroic feat with Seer Kel, you can look at the top five cards of the Overlord deck, giving you unparalleled insight into the traps and punishment that will shortly arrive! What&rsquo;s more, you can choose one of these cards and place it on the bottom of the Overlord deck before you shuffle the remaining cards and replace them on top of the deck. In this way, you can mitigate the most dangerous possible threat before it ever becomes reality. Ultimately, you&rsquo;ll need magical tricks like this to achieve victory in Stewards of the Secret, especially as the overlord player calls upon horrific monsters spawned by ancient sorcery.<br/><br/>The ferrox can sap the power of their enemies and use it to repair their own bodies. Sustained by their victim&rsquo;s strength, a ferrox is a worthy match for any hero. When you call upon the ferrox as the overlord player, you&rsquo;ll quickly see the attributes that made them such useful servants for Devis. A ferrox can hit dangerously hard in melee combat, and it can spend its surges to pierce even the thickest plate armor and spread disease to hinder the heroes turn after turn. The master ferrox boasts an even more dangerous ability. By spending an action, a master ferrox can use Extract to choose an adjacent hero. That hero must test its might&mdash;if he fails, he suffers two fatigue, and the ferrox recovers two damage! Not only does Extract give your ferrox unexpected staying power, dealing fatigue can restrict the heroes&rsquo; movement and their use of Class cards. If you wish to recover the dangerous secrets of the mad mage Devis, you can do no better than to call upon the ferrox for your own dark army.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"288311": "English first edition"}, "name": "Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) \u2013 Stewards of the Secret", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "average": "8.0037", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "81", "expands": {"104162": {"name": "Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"24281": "Campaign Games"}}, "186342": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2730432.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"90109": {"name": "Johannes Bartels"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "22", "boardgameartist": {"12116": "Bernhard Skopnik"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4269": {"name": "moses.

The playing pieces in the game represent companies of infantry and cavalry or sections of artillery Each infantry and cavalry unit has one strength point and is equivalent to between 45 and 100 men, depending upon the scenario. Each artillery unit has two strength points and equals two guns. The players of Rebel Yell assume the roles of divisional commanders.<br/><br/>Each game turn is broken down into segments. During an action segment, the units of a particular player may conduct a single action. In the beginning modules these actions are: Move, Fire, Assault, and Rally. During any Small Arms segment, the units of a particular player may only fire.<br/><br/>There are no movement phases, fire phases, etc., as there are in other Civil War games. This absence, in addition to the fact that player segments are structured reciprocally, produces a feel of simultaneity uncommon to other designs.<br/><br/>One of the most difficult problems faced by the Civil War tactician was the &quot;problem of approach,&quot; in other words, how he should maneuver his unit to some objective while keeping his casualties and disorganization at a minimum. A commander who did not pay heed to the destructiveness of &quot;modern&quot; weaponry would find his formation damaged up to three hundred yards from the enemy. Rebel Yell addresses this problem. Within restrictions, defending units may fire at the enemy as he advances. Like a real-life commander, a player can no longer be certain that when he initiates an advance, his units will reach their objective. Players may find that even one or two companies Standing to Fire will be difficult to dislodge by frontal assault.<br/><br/>Although Rebel Yell is a complex design, it is not out of the reach of the novice gamer. The rules are programmed, allowing small portions to be digested first and getting players into the game quickly. Provisions are made for such factors as infantry line formations (Standing to Maneuver, Standing to Fire, Skirmishers, and Cover), volley effects, leader quality, morale, and regimental flags. The rules for cavalry and artillery are also extensive.<br/><br/>Although an excellent multi-player game, Rebel Yell accommodates the solitaire player, Likewise it can be played in a physically limited area.

This absence, in addition to the fact that player segments are structured reciprocally, produces a feel of simultaneity uncommon to other designs.<br/><br/>One of the most difficult problems faced by the Civil War tactician was the &quot;problem of approach,&quot; in other words, how he should maneuver his unit to some objective while keeping his casualties and disorganization at a minimum. A commander who did not pay heed to the destructiveness of &quot;modern&quot; weaponry would find his formation damaged up to three hundred yards from the enemy. Rebel Yell addresses this problem. Within restrictions, defending units may fire at the enemy as he advances. Like a real-life commander, a player can no longer be certain that when he initiates an advance, his units will reach their objective. Players may find that even one or two companies Standing to Fire will be difficult to dislodge by frontal assault.<br/><br/>Although Rebel Yell is a complex design, it is not out of the reach of the novice gamer. The rules are programmed, allowing small portions to be digested first and getting players into the game quickly. Provisions are made for such factors as infantry line formations (Standing to Maneuver, Standing to Fire, Skirmishers, and Cover), volley effects, leader quality, morale, and regimental flags. The rules for cavalry and artillery are also extensive.<br/><br/>Although an excellent multi-player game, Rebel Yell accommodates the solitaire player, Likewise it can be played in a physically limited area. Rebel Yell is &quot;big&quot; only in the sense that it is detailed.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"288339": "First edition"}, "age": "14", "name": "Middle Creek: Folio Series No. 6", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "average": "8", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"28241": "One Small Step Folio Series"}}, "186360": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2745197.jpg", "poll": {}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "10", "boardgamepublisher": {"15984": {"name": "Devil Pig Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2745197_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "This Gazette was issued to combine the 2 existing errata sheets, for the first printing base box and expansions, with a few scenarios, some background and a new recruitment tile.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>&ndash;2 punchboards<br/>&ndash;Heroes background text about D-Day and Heinrich Von Kamptz<br/>&ndash;Landing scenario &ldquo;No mercy for the brave!
