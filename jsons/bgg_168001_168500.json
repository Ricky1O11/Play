Move over Poker, there's a new card game in town! The2101Game! It's an exciting new card game that combines skill and luck with a unique twist to provide the ultimate card gaming experience. The2101Game is a very easy game to learn, and it can be played with as many as 11 players. The pot grows with rapid speed, giving every player an opportunity to win BIG! So if you're feeling lucky get your family, friends, and fellow gamers together and start playing The2101Game. The2101Game caters to people of all different gaming backgrounds. From the avid gamers to non-gamers alike, they all agree that The2101Game is one of the simplest yet most complex games that they have ever played. People who are typically and instantly drawn to this game are people who play poker, spades, rummy, Phase 10, and Uno although just having a general knowledge of cards is all you need to play The2101Game.<br/><br/>The2101Game is played with two decks of cards minus a 2 of diamonds, a 10 of clubs, and an Ace of spades.<br/><br/>To start play everyone is dealt 3 sets of cards which are 3 pocket cards (these cards go in your hand and are for your eyes only!), 3 face up cards, and 3 face down cards (which go over above the face up cards). The object of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all 9 of your cards by first playing all of your pocket cards, then all of your face up cards, then finally all of your face down cards. All you have to do is match or beat the card on the pile and if you can't, you pick up the entire pile and must play them all before you play any new cards unless you have  &quot;2101 cards&quot;, also referred to as wild cards. There are 3 &quot;2101 cards&quot; which are the 2, 10, and Ace. The 10 is the highest of the 3 cards. When played, the 10 clears the pile and also gives the player another turn. The Ace is the second highest &quot;2101 card&quot;. It has no special powers but is just considered high. The lowest &quot;2101 card&quot; is the 2. When played the 2, also referred to as the &quot;any card&quot;, starts the pile back low. It can be played on any card and any card can be played on top of it. You can only play your face up cards once you have no pocket cards left and you can only play your face down cards when you have no face up or pocket cards. Pocket cards must be played one at a time unless you have multiples. Multiple cards of the same value can be played together but is not mandatory and suits do not matter. Face Up cards must be played the same way but if you can not beat the card on the pile with one of your face up cards you must pocket that card that you were unable to play along with the entire pile. Face down cards are also played one at a time but once you touch a face down card that is the card you must use. If you can not beat the card on the pile with the chosen face down card you must pocket that card along with the entire pile.<br/><br/>The betting element is what makes the game more interesting. There are 4 betting stages. First the table bet (this is a predetermined amount to get cards (similar to an ante). Second bet is the pocket bet. This bet is made after the cards are dealt but before any cards are played and is initiated by the person with the highest set of face up cards. The &quot;2101 cards&quot; are what is typically looked for when determining who has the highest set of face up cards.  The third bet is the face up bet. The face up bet is initiated by the first player to get to their face up cards without having any pocket cards. The fourth bet is the face down bet. The face down bet is initiated by the first person to get to their face down cards without having any face up or pocket cards. When a bet is initiated, starting to the left of the initiator, players must match the bet to continue in the round. Players also have the option to raise when their turn comes around. If a player does not want to make the bet they must fold their hand and forfeit any already wagered chips.<br/><br/><br/>    Note - once a player puts their bet on the table it can no longer be removed even if the player changes their mind and decides to fold. Betting in turn can significantly reduce the chances of this happening.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Note - When 4 cards of the same value are played on to the pile it constitutes a clear as a 10 would and also gives the player who played the fourth consecutive card another turn.<br/><br/><br/>"}, "168009": {"boardgamedesigner": {"78813": {"name": "Bruno Vieira de Castro Freitas"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Flagship Armada", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}, "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2354301_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2354301.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"256991": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1016": {"name": "Science Fiction"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "4X Space boardgame revolving around assymetrical factions vying for control of the galaxy.<br/><br/>Each player plays a Faction and is set to a home system.<br/><br/>In this system, he needs to expand his fleet and colonies, so more resources are added to his growing empire.<br/><br/>At his side, each player has a powerful starship called Flagship.

Interesting&hellip;.AAAHHH!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Do you dare to visit Darkwater Station where murky, polluted waters are reclaimed for use by civilization?<br/><br/>Darkwater Station is a single external map of an industrial plant with a canal basin of dark water spanned by two bridges and surrounded by three buildings, a garage, and industrial equipment.<br/><br/>Darkwater Station is intended for use in modern and near future science fiction games. It could be used in a far future science fiction game on a more backwater planet. The dark water canal has a potential use in Horror games as well.<br/><br/>Darkwater Station can be used in myriad ways. It could be used as a hydroelectric dam, a desalination plant, or a water filtration plant as some examples.<br/><br/>Adventure hook for use with this product:<br/><br/>It Came From the Dark Water: The water kept getting murkier and cloudier every day. HydroDamics couldn&rsquo;t care less as long as the dam kept working and the power stayed on so they could fleece their customers for every watt they used.<br/><br/>Eventually the pollutants got so bad that it clogged the dam up. The two monitoring and relay stations of the facility put out an emergency message to the main corporation HQ for urgent help fixing the problem.<br/><br/>Soon the failed dam started affecting the grid, causing a massive power outage. Every second the water was stalled, HydroDamics was losing money and customer trust in their grid. HydroDamics decided to send in a team of the best scientists and engineers they could to figure out the problem and fix it. But when they got to the facility they found the checkpoint outside unguarded and the facility covered in a black ichor as the pumps failed and the water slowly flooded the plant.<br/><br/>They entered the facility. The engineers got the pumps working again. Their scientist saw bubbles in the canal. He got closer to the water to investigate the phenomena. Then the dark water erupted, snagging the scientist, and pulling him into the dark depths. The dark water surged towards the engineers at the pumps and enveloped them next. The last communication HydroDamics had with the team was a desperate cellphone call for help from the last surviving engineer before his cellphone went dead with a scream of terror.<br/><br/>HydroDamics has assembled a new team of eggheads and this time they have sent in mercenaries to guard them. Will this new team figure out what is going on or meet the same fate as the first team? Everyone going in knows that there is someone or something lurking in the dark water...<br/><br/>"}, "168031": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2411873.png", "boardgameimplementation": {"173323": "Character Quest: Heroes \u2013 Goblin Raiders Adventure"}, "is_expanded_by": {"174510": {"name": "Character Quest: Desert Warrior's Hero Set"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"78711": {"name": "Calvin Nelson"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"78711": "Calvin Nelson"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "boardgameintegration": {"173322": "Character Quest: Heroes The Card Game \u2013 Game Pack #2: Savage Beasts"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2411873_t.png", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Goblins are pillaging the countryside.

Now, armed with nothing but patches of the new script and (sometimes obscene) scribbles in the margins, you all need to put on a show. Good luck!<br/><br/>In Bill Shakespeare is Dead, one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s famous plays is split into five short acts. During each act, one person acts as the Stage Manager, and two people are randomly chosen to act out the scene. As they go through the script, the rest of the players will have to fill in missing nouns and verbs randomly drawn from the deck and helpfully shouted when there is a blank part in the script. The Stage Manager chooses which nouns and verbs go where.

Each installment contains only one spell, but each promises to be so beneficial to any arcane caster who decides to study them, there will be little doubt that it was worth the additional time and expense.<br/><br/>One of the most remarkable aspects of these spells is that they evolve with the caster, becoming more and more useful as time goes on. For that reason, some have started calling them &ldquo;legacy spells.&rdquo; The cost for their exceptional usefulness is that the casting of these spells becomes correspondingly more complex, time<br/>consuming and expensive as their power increases.<br/><br/>Another thing that sets these spells apart is that they do not operate within any traditional school of magic. The reason for this is not known, though some speculate that it is because they tend to access multiple<br/>schools simultaneously, while others believe that they tap into a different kind of magic entirely.<br/><br/>Unlike Gothnog&rsquo;s Magnificent Cantrips, these spells are not for the casual caster or arcane dabbler. Only serious arcane practitioners should attempt to learn and employ these formidable incantations.<br/><br/>This first spell is called Uncanny Expansion, and it allows the caster to increase the amount of useable space in almost any given vessel.

Set in the Dystopian Universe, players take on the role of powerful crime bosses, building their criminal organizations by carefully recruiting new operatives with specialized skills and directing their team&rsquo;s nefarious deeds. All of your specialists are either in play or in your hand, ready to be used as you command. This unique hand-building mechanism gives you total control of your strategy.<br/><br/>Grifters is all about stealing as much money as you can from the corrupt government, malicious corporations, and your rival players. Each player starts the game with a hand of six Specialist cards, each with unique abilities. Your objective is to use this team of six Specialists to recruit more criminals, complete jobs, steal from the government coffers and swindle your opponents.<br/><br/>Each specialist has a special ability and skill. On your turn you can play a single specialist to perform their ability, or you can play a team of specialists to use their combined skills to complete a job. This means every specialist is a valuable asset to your criminal enterprise, earning immediate benefit through abilities and valuable end-game bonuses by completing jobs against the same target. And because all the cards in your deck are always available, you decide how to maximize your play.<br/><br/>Grifters uses a unique card &quot;cooldown&quot; system to control the use of your cards. On your turn, you play one or more specialist cards into the first &quot;Night&quot; of your hideout. If you already have a specialist card, or a team of specialist cards, in night one those cards advance to night two and push other cards through your hideout.<br/><br/>When a card is pushed out of the third night of your hideout it enters the refresh area. Any cards in your refresh area will return to your hand at the end of your turn.<br/><br/>The game ends when the coffers run out of money, there are no more jobs left to complete, or if there are no more specialists cards left for recruiting. End game bonuses are calculated for completing multiple jobs against the same target.  The player with the most money wins.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The Grifters (1st Ed) was first released via Kickstarter with the following backer exclusives:<br/><br/>Upgraded player tableaus - A thick chipboard tableau with linen finish will replace the cardstock tableaus found in the base game.<br/><br/>4 x New &quot;Ringleader&quot; cards - Informants are a new ringleader (every player starts with one of each of the ringleaders) that add an element of bluff and deception to the game.<br/><br/>With Informants in play, you can play any card face down and take the Informant action.  Any other player may challenge the Informant. When challenged, the active player reveals the card that was played. If that card is the Informant, the challenger must give the active player 2M ISK. If that card is not the Informant, no payments are due from any player to the active player, the challenger steals 2M ISK from the active player and gets to take the action on the card that was played.<br/><br/>Informants are a really fun addition to the game and totally fitting with the Dystopian Universe.<br/><br/>A set of these promo specialist cards.<br/><br/>You are Awesome - Bonus #1: 3 x The Security Specialist promo<br/>You are Awesome - Bonus #2: 3 x Crooked Warden promo<br/>You are Awesome - Bonus #3: 3 x Veteran promo<br/>You are Awesome - Bonus #4: 3 x Underboss promo<br/>You are Awesome - Bonus #5: 3 x Negotiator promo<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"303055": "1st Edition"}, "average": "6.95515", "name": "Grifters", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2664": "Deck / Pool Building"}, "age": "14", "usersrated": "695", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5496": "Thematic Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "168055": {"boardgamedesigner": {"78716": {"name": "James Pianka"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Roots: A Game of Inventing Words", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "26", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}, "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2282140_t.png", "average": "6.23462", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"28470": {"name": "Predicate"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2282140.png", "boardgameversion": {"257074": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Roots is a game of inventing words.

The little Inuit need to pack up and rush home as quickly as they can. However, their journey back is fraught with many dangers. Heavy snow and strong winds make it difficult for them to find the shortest route back, the ice beneath them could break apart at any time, and hungry polar bears are lurking nearby! Using clever planning and a keen memory, can you be the first to navigate your Inuit across the ice floes and back to the safety of their igloo?<br/><br/>In Polar Rush!, seven ice floe tiles are placed together on the table to form the game board. On each ice floe are seven different animals or items found in the arctic. Movement tiles are spread out face down on the table. On a turn, a player reveals a number of movement tiles one at a time based on the number rolled on the die. If he reveals a &quot;seal&quot; and a seal is adjacent to his current position, he must move his Inuit to the &quot;seal&quot; (even if it means he must move backwards); if a seal isn't nearby, he doesn't move.<br/><br/>The floes also feature special characters that can help (or hamper) a player's movement, so with clever planning your movement can be quite successful. For example, if you move to a sled, your next move doesn't need to be to an adjacent tile &mdash; but if you reveal a &quot;crack&quot; tile, you can separate the game board to create a water gap between the floes. The only way to cross this is to reveal a kayak tile. The first person to get his Inuit home wins!<br/><br/>Polar Rush! includes simplified rules for Inuit as young as five as well as more complex rules for older Inuit.<br/><br/>"}, "168066": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Postmortem: One Must Die", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"257096": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2466": "Other"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2155": "RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "What is Postmortem?<br/><br/>Indie game playing an Agent of Death who must take ONE life that could change the fate of a conflict-torn Nation!

The action begins on Peach, the outermost planet, a most desolate, moon-like place but the gateway to the system, then moves through the asteroid belt that contains huge amounts of mineral wealth to Cheteria, the ice planet. After Cheteria comes Three, the garden world that feeds the system, followed by D'Var, the desert planet whose sands conceal vast seas of valuable oil. Finally the campaign climaxes on fiery Adeen, closest to the sun, but the source of limitless power.<br/> The campaign is designed to be played through twice: with each player first taking the part of the race invading the Pankova system, the Attackers, and then taking the part of the incumbents, the Defenders. Be warned, sometimes the Defenders are attacking, and sometimes the Attackers are defending: as first one side then the other gains an advantage.<br/> Although written for Q13, Five Planets can be easily adapted for any sci-fi rules system. Each scenario contains a full game briefing, a map, and then a briefing for each player, including a description of the forces available. All players need to do is print off the appropriate pages for the scenario that they want to play, set up the battlefield, break out the figures, and away they go. As the army lists given are generic, players can use them to play any sci-fi army that they choose: whether based on a particular range of figures, background from another ruleset, background from a film or book, or even a background that they have made up themselves.<br/><br/>"}, "168113": {"rpgitemversion": {"257168": "German Flyer"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Olympus", "rpgproducer": {"21789": "Tobias Hamelmann"}, "rpg": {"21069": "Shadowrun (5th Edition)"}, "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"23676": "The Sixth World"}, "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"458": "Modern (Near Future)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"23626": "Schnell und dreckig"}, "average": "0", "description": "user summary<br/><br/>A small promotional flyer by Pegasus Spiele from Germany.

In order to gain these cards the Pilgrim has to pay life tokens to the keepers. <br/>In the meantime the Santa Compa&ntilde;a player, secretly, will use its cards to threaten the other players, steal their life tokens and finally convert them to its allies.

The vordis come in many shapes and sizes, and indeed, they are in many ways more of a culture or an organization than they are a race. Their numbers grow by harvesting the flesh of living creatures, which they incorporate into ever more strange and exotic designs The ultimate goal of the vordis is nothing less than to recreate all life in their own twisted, metallic image.<br/><br/>This book presents both mythic and non-mythic versions of two members of this terrifying race. The vordis surgeon (CRs 9 and 11) is not only the horrifying product of mad science, but is devoted to performing the same kinds of twisted and sadistic experiments that created it on other creatures. Its surgical claws slice and dice with horrifying ease, and its special serums can transform the living into the undead, or allow it to control undead already animated. The vordis harvester (CRs 12 and 15) has the upper-body of a humanoid corpse, and the lower body of a massive cockroach. It can remove its victims&rsquo; limbs with its attacks, and then quickly graft those limbs onto its own body in order to gain a variety of benefits from them. Beyond these four monster stat-blocks, the book also contains a graft from each of these two types of vordis monstrosities, allowing players who harvest these parts to attach them to themselves in order to use the vordis&rsquo;s greatest weapons against them.<br/><br/>"}, "168139": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Ziggurat", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"310882": "English/European PlayStation 4 edition"}, "average": "6.98571", "videogametheme": {"2265": "Horror"}, "usersrated": "7", "videogamegenre": {"2339": "Action RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"5248": "Linux"}, "videogamehonor": {"37571": "2014 AzPlay Awards Most Re-Playable Game Winner"}, "poll": {}, "description": "As a neophyte sorcerer you are one of many to go the rite of passage: to enter the maze of the Ziggurat and face deadly skulls, skeletons, ghosts and powerful bosses in order to clear your way through the final floor equipped with powerful wands, staffs or spell books.

Of the officers and men in both the squadrons that faced each other in these stormy seas far from home, nine of ten were doomed to perish.&rdquo;<br/><br/>-- Winston Churchill<br/><br/>This autumn marks the centennial of The Great War. Among the most dramatic sagas in a dramatic season was that of the German East Asia Squadron under Rear Adm. Maximilian Graf von Spee. Stranded by the sudden outbreak of war on the other side of the world, Spee&rsquo;s squadron evaded enemy forces for months. Dispatched the raider Emden to harry British trade in the Indian Ocean and then handed the Royal Navy its first defeat in battle in 99 years off the shore of Chile near Cape Coronel. That devastating defeat sent two British armored cruisers to the depths with their entire crews at trifling cost to Spee&rsquo;s squadron.<br/><br/>The stunning defeat provoked the British into sending two of their new battlecruisers thousands of miles from the European theater to search for and destroy Spee&rsquo;s squadron. Spee and the British squadron met at The Falklands just five weeks after Coronel. This time it was Spee&rsquo;s squadron which was annihilated.<br/><br/>For a hundred years historians and naval officers have debated Spee&rsquo;s choices and those of his opponents and speculated about what might have been. Fatal Choices looks at the course of the actual campaign and considers how it might have played out differently. But more than that, Fatal Choices applies the discipline of authentic naval wargames to evaluate those what-ifs under realistic constraints. And it provides the reader with the tools to see for himself how the battles may have played out.<br/><br/>By special arrangement with noted author and wargame designer Larry Bond, Fatal Choices contains an extract of Bond&rsquo;s superbly authentic and comprehensive Fear God &amp; Dread Nought naval wargaming rules providing the reader with all the rules, ship forms and tables needed to refight the historical battles and several credible what-ifs. See For Yourself scenarios examine historical battles such as Coronel and the Cocos Islands, as well as possible alternative fights such as Spee running into the Australian battlecruiser HMAS Australia or the old battleship HMS Canopus. Other scenarios examine what might have happened if the modern armored cruiser HMS Defence had joined the British squadron in time for Coronel or if Spee had a ventured to attack the British ships while they were coaling in Stanley Harbor instead of attempting to flee.<br/><br/>Fatal Choices also includes another entire set of rules, an extract of Minden Game&rsquo;s NavTac fast-play naval wargaming rules for those readers who are new to naval wargaming or pressed for time.<br/><br/>The Kickstarter edition of Fatal Choices also includes a special set of laser-cut ship counters including all the ships mentioned in the scenarios as well as play aids.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"257283": "First Edition"}, "average": "4.5", "name": "Fatal Choices", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "2", "expands": {"6540": {"name": "Fear God and Dread Nought"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "168168": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2285014.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"78776": {"name": "Charly von Feyerabend"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"34598": "Jacqueline Urban"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"384": {"name": "HABA - Habermaa\u00df GmbH"}}, "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2285014_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "description": "The game is played with two sets of cards, one set showing the top half of a ballerina figure in various positions, and the other showing the bottom half.

Like you just had to get out of there at any cost? Well now you might be right! LocaliZED is a Zombie survival game set in your backyard. It is a 1-8 player co-op game that uses any map and your imagination to turn your neighbourhood in into Zombified blood fest.<br/><br/>LocaliZEd is an open-source print and play game that encourages players to customise their game within the parameters of the core rule set. LocaliZED has players use a map of their hometown, or anywhere else they would like to try and survive a Zombie apocalypse, as the board. On this board a few key locations, church, school, police station are set and then players are given missions at random that force them to interact with these locations while Zombies quickly accumulate on the board.<br/><br/>As the game progresses players draw cards from one common deck that sometimes cause more Zombies to flood the map, sometimes giving the players bonus items and sometimes changing the dynamic of the whole board. <br/>The game is turn based and the turn sequence runs like this: clockwise players may all move once. Then running clock-wise again, from the same starting player, each player must fight the Zombies in their location once only.<br/>The core mechanic that players use to combat Zombies is really simple. In a location that has Zombies players must roll a D6. If they roll a score greater than the number of Zombies they are fighting then they have won the combat. They may now remove Zombies equal to the difference between their score and the number of Zombies. If they roll a score equal to the number of Zombies this is a draw and nothing happens. If they roll less than the number of Zombies then they have lost the combat and they lose 1 life.<br/> A roll of a 1 on any dice at any time means they lose the combat. A roll of a 6 on any dice at any time means they may roll an extra dice and count its result towards their score.<br/> For instance, if there are 4 Zombies in a location and you roll a 5 then you may remove 1 Zombie, because 5 is one greater than 4. If you had rolled a 4 then you would have drawn the combat and nothing would happen. If you had rolled a 6 you may have re-rolled the dice and added the score of the second dice to the original 6 potentially rolling another 6 and gaining yet another re-roll. If you had rolled a 3, 2 or 1 then you would have lost and had to lose 1 life.<br/> Players may team-up to fight Zombies, and this becomes very necessary. To do this they must be in the same Location. All players who are teaming-up must agree to the team-up before any dice are rolled. The player who&rsquo;s fighting (because it is their turn) may now roll their dice once only using their weapons. Then they may roll an extra dice for each other player that teamed-up. The player adds the totals together and combats the Zombies with this score.  Teaming-up allows players to achieve much higher scores. However, the down side of teaming up is that if they lose the combat everyone in the team-up loses 1 life.<br/><br/>LocaliZED also contains a rather unique mechanic for death. There is no player elimination, instead the dead player switches sides becoming a Zombie and gaining some control of the normally random Zombie deployment.<br/><br/>All of these missions and combat are driving the game towards the Final Mission. This one of 5 set endings for the game that can only be revealed once players have burned through all of the other missions. Final mission are always much harder than the individual missions that lead up to them but they generally involve all of the players working together to achieve them. Final missions range from hiding till the end of the apocalypse, curing the Zombies, killing the other players, or just out right killing all of the Zombies.<br/>The tone of the game is quite tongue in cheek with a lot of the missions and cards having humorous elements. Every part of the game is designed to leave the door wide open for players really take ownership of the scenarios an in-game elements, with blank cards of every type being provided, the onus being on using your own map as a board.<br/><br/>The game was written in response to the Beasts of War websites 2014 Halloween game design challenge. Beasts of War then went on to distribute the game as free down load to all of their members.<br/><br/>"}, "168183": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Farm Machines: Championships 2014", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"257309": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2456": "Driving"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2154": "Racing"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "The ultimate farmers' showdown returns with monstrous  new machines, brand new events and an expansive new terrain!<br/><br/>Are you the fastest, most accurate and craziest farmer in the competition?<br/><br/>Climb aboard  Farm Machines Championship 2014 and sit behind the wheel of tenacious tractors and humongous harvesters to compete in 40 various events.

The time bar decreases a bit faster and new tiles can have a higher value when you reach a higher level.<br/>     The higher the sum of merged tiles, the biggest the decrease in adjacent tiles.<br/>     Prime tiles are red, non-prime are green.

It is a spin-off of the Art Academy series featuring characters from the Pok&eacute;mon media franchise, and was first released in Japan in June 2014, followed by English releases in Europe and Australia the following July, and North America in October. The game is available as both a retail release and downloadable game from the Nintendo eShop, and is the first 3DS title with built-in Miiverse support for sharing artwork.<br/><br/>Pok&eacute;mon Art Academy is an educational art game designed to teach players how to draw various Pok&eacute;mon characters through 40 advancing lessons. Players progress through three skill levels - Novice, Apprentice, and Graduate - while learning new techniques and art concepts, with additional tools such as pastel and paintbrush being unlocked along the way. The Novice course begins with skills such as drawing head-on portraits, angles, and construction shapes, while later stages introduce shading, hatching, opacity, and freehand sketches. Each drawing can be transferred to a Pok&eacute;mon Trading Card Game card border upon completion, with the option to add a background image.<br/><br/>The game also includes a Free Paint Mode that allows players to draw whatever they wish, with the option to load templates as reference, as well as Quick Sketch Mode, which requires making a simple drawing with limited tools. Additional templates can be obtained by progressing through lessons, or as downloadable content through special promotions over Nintendo Network. Pok&eacute;mon Art Academy features Miiverse functionality that allows for drawings to be uploaded to Nintendo's Miiverse Community, as well as take part in art contests.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Pok\u00e9mon Art Academy&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "168209": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Monsters of the Hydra", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "8", "average": "0", "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "boardgameversion": {"257391": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "poll": {}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Adventurers seek to slay a nine headed hydra that has unleashed a myriad of monsters into the world.<br/><br/>This game contains tiles, chits, cards and dice.<br/><br/>Players win the game by either defeating the lead nine headed hydra and/or the head vampiress.

Is it a deal?<br/><br/>In each round (or Deal), place 3 artefact cards in the middle of the table: 2 face up and 1 face down. Two players must agree on how to divide up these 3 cards. Attention: all the cards must go somewhere; none can be set aside. Cards from previous rounds cannot be exchanged. Negotiations are free and open. They end as soon as both players accept a proposal and say, &ldquo;DEAL!&rdquo;<br/>Once an agreement has been reached, the 2 players each take their share and place it behind their own screens. The player who has obtained the face-down card can look at it (secretly or openly) and put it with his or her other cards.<br/>The game ends with there are no more cards in the stack.<br/><br/>"}, "168222": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Sir Reginald Lichlyter's Trusty Tavern Tome", "rpgproducer": {"14055": "Rick Hershey"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2286075.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"257409": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"27944": "Sir Reginald Lichlyter's"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2286075_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Sir Reginald Lichlyter, owner of the Wine &amp; Spirit Emporium, is back to bring you hundreds of new alcoholic beverages from standard ales, fantastical wines, and magic liquors!

Twenty-four years later war returned to Europe, with Russia, France and Italy seeking to overturn the settlement with a war of aggression against the Central Powers of Imperial Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire.<br/><br/>Royal Netherlands Navy is the third book in our alternative history series, The Second Great War. In the first book, The Kaiser&rsquo;s Navy, we looked at the High Seas Fleet of 1940 and its campaigns in the North Sea and Atlantic. In the second, The Habsburg Fleet, the Imperial and Royal Austro-Hungarian Navy, alongside its Turkish allies, wages war in the Mediterranean Sea.<br/><br/>In this volume, the fleet the Dutch admirals hoped to build in our world, but could not get approved, finds itself pressured by the Japanese in the Far East and the British and French in Europe. Defending their rights with armed force, the Dutch find themselves drawn into desperate battles in the North Sea, North Atlantic, South China Sea and the interior waters of the East Indies.<br/><br/>In the 1930s, Dutch shipyards stood at the leading edge of naval technology: Dutch submarines first deployed the schnorkel breathing device, for example, and Dutch warships boasted the sophisticated Hazemeyer fire control system that would be enthusiastically copied by the Royal Navy and others.  The Netherlands had the industrial and financial means to create a large and modern fleet, and the oil wealth of Borneo and Sumatra provided the motive.  Seeing deficits as a more lethal enemy than the Axis, the Dutch government of our reality doomed both the home country and the colonies to defeat and occupation.  In the world of Wilson's Peace, things are a little different.<br/><br/>There are 210 die-cut and mounted playing pieces from the old, out-of-print Spice Islands booklet, and 90 brand-new laser-cut pieces (scorchless and sootless!) for 300 total: 120 double-sized &quot;long&quot; ship pieces and 180 standard-sized ones representing task forces, aircraft and smaller warships. The Dutch fleet that never was is present, along with French, British, Japanese and German ships, aircraft and airships. Yes, airships!<br/><br/>There are also thirty new scenarios based on the battles that might have been waged by the Royal Netherlands Navy in this alternate world, plus more of the story of the Second Great War begun in The Kaiser's Navy and continued in The Habsburg Fleet. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Strike South and Eastern Fleet to enjoy all of the scenarios.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"257415": "First edition"}, "average": "7.2", "name": "Second World War at Sea: Royal Netherlands Navy", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "5", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "expands": {"5702": {"name": "Second World War at Sea: Eastern Fleet"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"41379": "Second Great War"}}, "168229": {"rpgitemversion": {"257416": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "There Was A Dark, Dark House", "rpgproducer": {"26597": "Eloy Lasanta"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2286072.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"20614": "FirstFable"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2286072_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>There Was A Dark, Dark House is a Halloween adventure for the FirstFable RPG published by OneBookShelf.<br/><br/>This tale is inspired by ghost stories told around a campfire.

Supershow is the worlds first UCG, or unpredictable card game that takes place in the underground wrestling word of the Legendary Fighting Federation. The goal of the game is to hit your FINISH card for a chance to defeat your opponent.<br/><br/>When competing in the Legendary Fighting Federation competitors use the Lead - Follow up - Finish game engine, which makes the game easy to pick up by impossible to put down.<br/><br/>The LFF Engine is simple, on a players turn; they may play 1 card, that card can be; a FINISH card if they have a FOLLOW UP in play. A FOLLOW UP card if they have a LEAD in play. Or they may play a LEAD card. After each card is played, all players roll their Skill dice; the player who rolled the highest Skill draws a card and starts his turn. When a FINISH card is played a player has a chance to defeat his opponent with a dice roll, if he does not all cards in play are discarded, the Crowd Meter is raised to the next level and the game continues. The Crowd Meter increased the effectiveness of the FINISH cards as the game progresses.<br/><br/>When a FINISH card is played, a player attempts to PIN or SUBMIT his opponent with a FINISH ROLL. They roll their Skill dice to decide the FINISH ROLL. Their opponent has 3 dice rolls, called BREAKOUT ROLLS, to beat or tie the FINISH ROLL. This simulates beating the referees 3 count, or grabbing the ropes before the lifeless arm falls for the 3 time.<br/><br/>The Skill dice correlates with the Skill chart on the Competitor card you have selected. Each Competitor has a Gimmick, a unique effect that affects the game play, and 3 Finish cards. The 3 Finish cards are added to your Supershow Deck at the start of the game, and are also unique to that competitor.<br/><br/>Currently there are 7 playable competitors, each with their own unique backstory and interaction in the game. Additional characters can be won at our events, downloaded for free off our website, are handed out at live shows, or can purchased which each new set.<br/>Each deck in The Supershow is comprised of 30 cards and 1 Competitor card that have a Skill chart. These pre-constructed 30 cards are 15 Lead cards, 12 Follow Up cards, and 3 Finish cards. Your Finish cards are unique to your Competitor. These cards can be different colors, making them Strikes, Grapples, or Submissions. Your Strikes, Grapples, and Submissions can become harder or easier to stop depending on your Skill chart and the Skill chart of your opponent.<br/>Stop cards can be used to stop your opponent&rsquo;s moves.<br/><br/>The Supershow also has mechanics that for multiplayer formats, triple threat, four way, 2-4 player tag team, tornado tag team, each format can be elimination style, or first to Finish.

Then people whined that it was too dark so I censored this version for the kids. If it's too dark, then get a flash light you p!@#$.<br/><br/>After the time of the Apocalypse and the Age of Darkness, a new empire has risen from the decadence of Earth. An alliance of humans and an ancient alien race known as the eldrynn have formed the Armethian Empire. Magic, technology, and the theocratic government known as &quot;The Order&quot; have strengthened the structure of the known galaxy. The might of the military have assimilated many races under its own rule through diplomacy and endless war. Yet now, in the Age of Adventure, demons from the sixth dimension have once again found their way to the primordial realm. Heroes and villains alike must choose their path to immortality, struggle to survive, and stop the hordes of darkness from consuming their own dimension.<br/><br/>You must choose your own destiny. Crush your enemies with fist, blade, gun, and spell. Complete quests and missions for adventure, reputation, glory, wealth, and power. Stand alone, or as a part of a crew of powerful allies that struggle within a dark and distant future. Become mighty warriors or spell casters. Become heroes or villains that can reign powerful enough to create their own empires, and command their own armies. Select from over 20 different alien races and over 20 different character classes. Build your character to become as powerful as the immortals with over 100 levels of advancement. Choose from hundreds of different level advancement abilities and talents within a system that is designed for endless gameplay. You may even continue playing powerful characters after their death with rules for an afterlife campaign that moves into the sixth dimension. Thus the spirit world, where you may one day reach the status of angel or demon. You will discover how eternal the universe is with rules that let you travel across the multiverse while adventuring to new worlds, star systems, and galaxies.<br/><br/>Chaos 6010 A.D. allows for a completely upgradeable game system, encouraging you to create your own worlds, alien races, weapons, spells, monsters, or anything else that you might wish to design. There are plenty of random tables to help you construct these ideas, and adapt them to the system. Endless adventures await game masters and players of fantasy / sci-fi role-playing.<br/><br/>Be sure to check out Pray for Dawn, the very first module for Chaos 6010 A.D. This post apocalyptic, survival, horror throws the crew into 130 full color pages of twisted nightmares. Every street has a different tale and every house holds a wicked story. This module is intended for mature players and can be used for other games. It may also be played several times with many different outcomes and enemies. Pray for Dawn comes complete with a narrative if the game master is new or wishes to describe every detail of the massive Necropolis. This module will scare the !@#$ out of your players!

Other spots on the card allow the players to mitigate their luck by modifying the outcome of the dice rolls.<br/><br/>"}, "168254": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2286540.png", "poll": {}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "20", "age": "18", "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2286540_t.png", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "An extra deck of cards to spice up your game.<br/>In each round you flip over the Option C card after reading A and B.

Get fire and acid ready!&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Imagine what happened to the first group of players that encountered a nilbog&mdash;and watched it grow in size as the fighters each hit it 5 times. What about a pyrohydra&mdash;fire had no way to stop it from growing new heads&hellip; &ldquo;Oh my, what do we do now?&rdquo; may have been the next battlecry.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s not always necessary to make every monster a death-dealing enigma; however fear of the unknown is one of the strongest tools in the GM&rsquo;s arsenal. It keeps players on their toes and makes the game more fun. Certainly the old mundane standbys need a place at the table (and the miniature case); after all, what is a dungeon without a troll or ten?<br/><br/>"}, "168358": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Nerv\u00edky", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "3", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2289439_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1765": {"name": "Dino"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2289439.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"257624": "Nerv\u00edky"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A dexterity game.<br/><br/>NOTE: Nerv&iacute;ky (Czech/Slovak) = nerves (to be more precise: little nerves).<br/><br/>Set-up: One player (the catcher) has a small cup, and a die with different colours on its faces.

Enemy wands that kill the player if touched march in predetermined patterns around each level's grid. The design is such that, with careful timing, the player can swing through seemingly impassable groups of enemies. Players can also swing from the same dot as an enemy by staying on the opposite side of it, since most enemy wands rotate at the same speed. At higher levels, more enemies are introduced, such as doors that open and close when the player's wand passes over a switch, hyperdots that send players to a different dot, and drops of acid that follow the player around.<br/><br/>The player's wand is in continuous motion; the only control is to reverse its direction of rotation, or to swing to another dot. Players can also swing to another dot and reverse rotation at the same time. All player motion is controlled by just four keys (reverse direction immediately, &quot;bounce&quot; (reverse direction when your wand passes by another dot), move to another dot, and move and reverse direction simultaneously).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;ClockWerx&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "168374": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Freakin' Funky Fuzzballs", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogameversion": {"257649": "Freakin' Funky Fuzzballs"}, "average": "6", "videogametheme": {"2466": "Other"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>There is no easy way to describe this game.

More recently, Queens College futurist and sometimes-CIA analyst Dr. Bruce Bueno de Mosquita wrote concerning China that he sees no factors in the present-day environment working to end or deflect that same cycle. It was the shared conclusions of those two men, working over a century-and-a-half apart, which inspired me to design this wargame modeling the military parameters and possibilities inherent in the next phase of Chinese quru &ndash; civil war.<br/><br/>The likely starting points for such a conflict would either be the collapse of the Chinese real estate bubble &ndash; which is already broadly predicted to be inescapable and will constitute the largest financial collapse in world history &ndash; or the growing potable water crisis. (A third of the water consumed by the Chinese is undrinkable by US standards.) Beyond those factors, or in combination with them, there&rsquo;s also the gender imbalance, the fossil fuel air pollution crisis, the increasingly endemic corruption, the aging population structure, the expanding rural-urban economic gap, as well as the general collapse of ideology and the resultant moral lapse throughout the populace. One, some, or all of these factors may eventually lead to a crisis in China, as so often occurs in history, resulting in a civil war.<br/><br/>Each turn equals two months, probably starting sometime late in this decade or early in the next.

The locals say that they have seen this dead man lurking about town at night time. The player characters are playing detectives trying to figure out who murdered the man. With little evidence of foul play from the autopsy, they might decide to investigate the rumors.<br/><br/>While in town at night, they see a man matching the dead man&rsquo;s physical appearance wandering around town. He stops around his former house and gropes at the door handle of his own home, moaning in frustration that he is barred entry from his home. He then walks back to the cemetery glumly.<br/>If the group follows him, they find that he is not alone. Many men and women are wandering around the old cemetery in various states of decay. If they see the detectives they wander up to them and moan in frustration as if trying to communicate but don&rsquo;t attack them unless provoked. The detectives might recognize them as other people who were found dead of mysterious circumstances in the last year.<br/><br/>When the recently dead man sees them he walks up to them and starts talking! He wants to know what happened to his possessions like his keys and wallet. He needs his keys to get back into his house and stop squatting in this cemetery.<br/><br/>The player characters can explain that he is dead, which makes the dead man confused and possibly angry, since he doesn&rsquo;t seem to realize he is dead. Or they can bluff him, pretending they have his keys and wallet and they&rsquo;ll give them back after a few questions, maybe even promising to take him to the police station to give them back to him. The dead man doesn&rsquo;t remember too much as if he has amnesia, but he might be able to reveal some clues about his killer, a witch doctor using drugs or herbs to kill people that then cause them to be brought back as zombies with the proper ritual. Those resurrected this way have some consciousness left, but it quickly fades away over time.<br/><br/>Another murder occurs in the next week unless the group confronts the witch doctor before then. The witch doctor is seen there at the funeral. If the group goes to the cemetery that very night, they can see the witch doctor performing a ritual surrounded by his human cronies and zombie thralls. It is time to stop the witch doctor lest he raise another zombie. His talking zombies apologize or look sad as they try to fight the group. When the witch doctor is defeated, the talking zombie thanks the group and other zombies seem to smile before walking to their coffins to finally rest in peace.<br/><br/>"}, "168388": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2289364.png", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4274": {"name": "Si-Si-Spiele"}}, "maxplaytime": "40", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2289364_t.png", "minplaytime": "40", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "description": "Objective: As a hero - collect as much gold as possible;<br/>as dragon - catch all heros; game ends after all gold is collected or all heros are caught/out of the game.<br/> - acting by turns -<br/>The dragon is placed in the centre of the board, each hero with two pieces of gold on his starting position; remaining gold (4 pieces) are placed at the far end of the cave.<br/>Players move according die roll forward, laterally or backwards.<br/>A '6' can be used only passing (stepping over) the dragon, otherwise not usable.

Although it was sparsely populated, many of the inhabitants were desperate and dangerous.  The West had always been home to large groups of American natives, but now had been receiving various undesirables such as cattle rustlers, gamblers, vigilantes, and banditos.  For the most part, those coming West were hungry for gold and were willing to do just about anything to get it.  Many found it too tiresome trying to get rich panning and digging, and instead found it more convenient to steal or kill for it.  As a consequence, it became the common practice not only for nearly everyone to carry a firearm, but also for nearly everyone to use one.  Needless to say gangs, posses, and gunfights were common parts of every day life.  Anybody with a gun had an opportunity to make a name and gain infamy in the great American West.<br/><br/>It is exactly this setting in which you find yourself in.  You have the option of choosing one of seven notorious gunfighters of the old American West:  Kid Rango, Chief War Wind, Pablo &lsquo;The Pistol&rsquo; Perez, Walter Winston, Raging Arrow, Luther &lsquo;The Lawman&rsquo; Hale, or Little Pancho.  Besides the 7 posse bosses, Gunslinger: Legends of the Dusty Trail also comes with an additional 42 gunfighters.  Each boss and gunfighter comes with their own mugshot and unique battle stats.  With your posse boss, recruit a gang from the various cities to ride out to face your rivals.  Dodge ruthless banditos, determined lawmen, and hostile natives to get to your next gig.  You can knock off the Bank of the Nation, rustle up some cattle, or take on the Union Pacific Railroad.  You can also track down the other gunslingers to collect the bounties on their heads.  The way you stack your posse, the strategy you employ, and knowing when to strike will always give you the edge.  Each boss comes with his own clutch skills that come in handy when the chips are down.  No matter how many times you play, the scenarios are endless and the game never looks the same twice.  The winner is the posse that bags the most gold, even if they end up in pine boxes.<br/><br/>With Gunslinger: Legends of the Dusty Trail, you get three  distinct games in the Gunslinger series.  You get everything you need to play Gunslinger Shootout (arena style combat), Gunslinger Showdown (mano y mano confrontation), and Gunslinger Roundup (recruit your posse, collect the bounties, and get the gold). Anybody can get lucky and be a hero!

It was released on December 31, 1995 for Macintosh and Windows 95. It is a point-and-click mystery game in which the player controls Derec, the main character in Isaac Asimov's Robot City.<br/><br/>In the vein of Myst and other graphic adventure games from the time, Robot City features a first-person perspective. The player must click to move around Robot City and interact with the 3-D environment. Unlike Myst, however, character interaction is an integral part of the game. A conversation system allows the reader to pick between a number of topics to talk about, and the player's choices can have significant in-game consequences. The game has multiple endings which also depend on the player's actions. The puzzles in the game are fairly straightforward, such as connecting the right wires and data chips to rebuild a robot. The real puzzles lie in choosing the right things to say in order to persuade other characters. This is where Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics really come into play. For example, a robot might block access to a certain area because it has been ordered to do so (it is following the second law). However, if you tell the robot that the real murderer is chasing you then the robot will let you enter; failure to do so would constitute allowing harm to come to a human through inaction, and the first law takes priority over the second in the game.<br/><br/>The story of the game closely follows Robot City, a series of novels inspired by Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Robot City (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "168435": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2326114.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"225370": {"name": "Between Two Cities: Capitals"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"65581": {"name": "Matthew O'Malley"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "7", "boardgameartist": {"71164": "Beth Sobel"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4785": {"name": "Ghenos Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2326114_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1029": {"name": "City Building"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"34505": "2015 Golden Geek Best Family Board Game Nominee"}, "description": "It is the early 1800s, a time of immense construction and urbanization.

However in Fallen Frontiers characters are not superheroes, they are weak and easy to eliminate when they are not with their squad.<br/><br/>Besides the miniatures that represent their army, players will also have a deck of cards assembled by them. Strategy is not revealed at the beginning of the game, as a player can secretly set up the deck of cards allowing them to change the game style in such a way that opponents will not be able to guess their strategy at first sight.<br/><br/>The factions and the cards use up resources to carry out certain actions. The main resources are moral and Krithium. Players gain moral by achieving targets and causing losses to their opponent's army while their army suffers as little as possible. Using moral points will make an army more powerful but will exhaust it in the process. Krithium is a resource that must be collected during the game. It is the source of energy that enhances a team's weapons and cards. The player will have an armory, a separate deck where the player purchases equipment, that can be used during the game and consumes Krithium. The contents of the armory is also set up by the player just like the deck of cards.<br/><br/>"}, "168450": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2283219.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"2733": "Stimmvieh"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1106": {"name": "Andrea Meyer"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"52911": "Daniel M\u00fcllenbach"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"598": {"name": "BeWitched Spiele"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2283219_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Stimmvieh is a game for party secretaries about collecting the largest donations for your party.

The point is not to kill, or to draw attention to yourself, but to pull off the perfect heist.

(If you didn't get the reference Traitors Gate is a location in the Tower of London where the Jewels are held.)  The Pentagon wants you to steal them before a defector from the organization does.  The caveat?  The British Government doesn't know you are going to steal the Crown Jewels.  And you can't tell them.  Or hurt them, for that matter - after all, they are just doing their job.<br/><br/>The most unique part of this game is that it is non-linear.  Up until the end of the game, you can do things in any order.

Campaign, fundraise, advertise, and win the swing states! SWING STATE is designed around the electoral college and the strategies involved in winning the 12 swing states during a US presidential election. It is super fun, super suspenseful, and the most realistic &quot;game&quot; about running for president you will ever experience.<br/><br/>The game can be played between 2 players.  It can also be played between 2 teams, ideally with 2 players for each team. One is the presidential candidate for the red team -- she chooses which states to visit each turn. Her teammate is the campaign manager for the red team -- he chooses where to spend the money on advertising.<br/><br/>The game begins with a map that reflects the way all 12 swing states actually lean. Pennsylvania leans Democratic by 4 percentage points (based on a historical average of recent presidential elections). That 4% point lean is reflected by four blue chips placed on PA during setup. Virginia, as you can see in the image, leans Red by 5% points (chips). As players campaign and advertize in these states, the chip stacks rise and fall and often flip from one color to the other.<br/><br/>A big part of the fun is that Swing State is a game that is easy to learn, easy to set up, and easy to play, but has a very rich mix of strategies that change each time you play. There are seven turns before election night.  And what makes this one of the most exciting games you will ever play is that the results of how each state will vote are not revealed until the very end.  At the end of the game -- election night -- all of the campaign funds you have invested by playing cards face down on each state are finally revealed.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"257812": "First edition"}, "age": "8", "name": "Swing State", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "average": "7.235", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "168484": {"boardgamedesigner": {"97044": {"name": "Geoffrey Greer"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Parenthood", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "10", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2608285_t.jpg", "average": "4.72", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"23584": {"name": "Ad Magic, Inc."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2608285.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"257813": "First English edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "A humorous card game where players promote their own kids' growth and success while sabotaging other players' kids with life's issues.

A set of 40 beautiful wooden blocks in two colors is all you need. And the blocks have it all: their special size is the building block for two exiting games. A haptic and tactical pleasure!<br/><br/>Kwinty - The Wall<br/><br/>The players are building together a wall between them. It is all about the visible sides of the blocks. Each block side corresponds to two equal-sized squares and exactly that is what counts! The aim of the game is to arrange the blocks in a series of five &quot;squares&quot; of the same color (horizontally, vertically or diagonally), while at the same time to block your opponent from doing the same. Sounds easy, but it is not - as always when two players want the same thing.<br/><br/>Turris - The Tower<br/><br/>Brick by brick the tower grows in height between the players creating on its four sides a patchwork of light and dark blocks. <br/>The players try to create concatenations of the sides of their blocks to the largest possible contiguous areas and at the same time to cut the opponent's surfaces. But be careful: each side of the tower is considered separately and individually evaluated at the end. The better the blocks are set, the more points you will earn.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"257814": "English/German first edition"}, "name": "Blocks", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2048": "Pattern Building"}, "average": "7.25357", "usersrated": "14", "boardgamefamily": {"5607": "3D Games"}}, "168487": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2316237.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"21002": {"name": "Rafa\u0142 Szyma"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "7", "boardgameartist": {"68008": "Igor Burlakov"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2726": {"name": "Portal Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2316237_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1039": {"name": "Deduction"}}, "description": "A board with hints going from the ghost to others players.

That is, until a woman stepped forward and volunteered for the command. Her true name remains as much a mystery to the Guardsmen outside of the Death Marshals as the source of her blindness.

In these pages you will find tales of the witchcraft, hauntings, monsters and malevolence that have plagued the people of the region, from pre-Colonial days into the 20th Century.<br/><br/>New England is a diverse territory. Some of the earliest settlements in the New World lie check by jowl with rugged country that, to this day, is all but untraveled by humanity. The sea, with its rocky shoals, rugged coves, unknown depths, and centuries of legend and lore holds sway over the minds of the region's inhabitants. The mountains and forests are just as mysterious and deadly, keeping secrets centuries and even millennia old, some of which mankind would be better off not knowing. Between these wild areas are the settled portions, farms and orchards inland and harbors filled with ships, and the folk that sail them on the coast. Man prevails in such places, but in the shadowed lanes, forgotten cellars, and flightless passages beneath his world, there is still much that is unknown and unsettling.<br/><br/>"}, "168499": {"rpgitemversion": {"257860": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Starship Tyche", "rpgproducer": {"32066": "Berin Kinsman"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2356583.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"203": "Fate Core"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "rpggenre": {"946": "Modern (Pop Culture)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2356583_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Explore the far reaches of outer space!
