One player takes the side of the light and the Dragon Reborn, while another takes the side of the shadow and the Forsaken, in a struggle for control of the Pattern, the ultimate fabric and destiny of the universe.<br/><br/>Each player requires his or her own Hero or Villain deck to play. Each deck features a major character from the Wheel of Time book series. The light side player chooses a hero to play with while the shadow player uses a villain deck. Characters in the side of light include series protagonists Rand al'Thor, Matrim Cauthon, Perrin Aybara, and the other characters of good found within the books. Characters for the shadow include dark friends, as well as Rahvin and the other chosen.<br/><br/>The players attempt to sway the Pattern to their side and amass the might needed to defeat his or her opponent in the final Pattern challenge and win the game. Along the way players will engage in politics, marshaling of armies, magic, and intrigue in an effort to bring characters, troops, and entire kingdoms onto their side.<br/><br/>The core of the Wheel of Time CCG involves rolling dice. Characters and troops, each have different stats corresponding to their skill in politics, intrigue, combat and the one power. These stats translate into dice rolls, used to win challenges and to generate resources.<br/><br/>Every turn, players commit their characters and troops into challenges. Challenges are done via playing challenge cards or initiating the pattern challenge, which is the ultimate objective for both the light and shadow. Unassigned characters and troops can be used to generate resources which in turn, can summon more allies or to attach buffs called advantages.<br/><br/>Players then contest challenges by comparing dice rolls of their committed characters and troops. The attacking player attempts to roll swords in the in-game custom dice, while the defending player attempts to roll shields. Winning challenge cards grant advantages based on card text, while winning the Pattern challenge may place Pattern tokens toward the side of the victorious player.<br/><br/>End game triggers upon both players having a total of twenty Pattern tokens, together with any neutral tokens generated during play. The game then proceeds to the final challenge, where the players fight for dominance, again rolling the dice generated by their characters and troops, but this time, adding their Pattern tokens toward their success rolls.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"240620": "First edition booster display box"}, "average": "5.32778", "name": "The Wheel of Time Collectible Card Game", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "126", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4667": "Customizable Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"6040": "CCGs (Collectible Card Games)"}}, "4106": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic12492.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"35248": "Batavia"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"183": {"name": "Dan Glimne"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2002", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"11883": "Franz Vohwinkel"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"335": {"name": "Jumbo"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic12492_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "description": "Modern Times takes place in the USA during the Roaring Twenties.

Also there are event cards such as injuries and automatic player upgrades (having a good night) which influence the game randomly.  <br/><br/><br/>"}, "4110": {"boardgamedesigner": {"77": {"name": "Mike Fitzgerald"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "X-Men Trading Card Game", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2000", "usersrated": "101", "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic12452_t.jpg", "average": "3.98832", "statistics": {}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4667": "Customizable Games"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic12452.jpg", "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamepublisher": {"13": {"name": "Wizards of the Coast"}}, "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "In the ever-evolving and chaotic world of the X-Men Trading Card Game, one thing is certain: You control the action.

The same year Hex appeared in the Danish newspaper Politiken under the name Polygon. Hein introduced the game to the readers on December 26, 1942 and during the following four months gave them a problem each day to begin with - eventually two days a week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The solution would always appear in the following column. It was independently invented by mathematician John Nash in 1947 at Princeton University. In 1952, Parker Brothers marketed a version. They called their version Hex, and the name stuck. Hex has the simplest rules of almost any game: connect your color edges with a path of tokens of your color. There is also a &quot;swap rule&quot; (also known as a pie rule) which compensates for the inherent advantage of the first player.<br/><br/>There are a number of resources for Hex on the internet, including several real-time servers. If you want to play face-to-face, used Hex sets are occasionally available, and you can also make your own set. A Battlemat with 1&quot; hexes can be cut into a 15x15 rhombus grid. Standard Go stones also work well for this board.

Historically, the Germans planned to break through the thin American defenses in this area, cross the Meuse River, and seize the port of Antwerp in Holland. The German high command hoped that success would force a political settlement on the Western Front, thus allowing Germany to direct its full attention to defeating the Russians. In order to win the game, the German player will almost certainly have to get some units across the Meuse River<br/><br/>The Ardennes, a thickly wooded area on the borders of Germany, Belgium, and Luxembourg, where battle weary U.S. divisions were sent to rest and replace losses, or units freshly arrived from the United States were given their first taste of front line duty. At 5:30am, December 16, 1944, this 85-mile-long sector erupted into what would be the largest, most costly campaign on the Western Front in WWII. The Battle of the Bulge had begun.<br/><br/>During the first week of the battle, three German armies attacked vigorously and relentlessly in an attempt to reach the Meuse River, the major geographical obstacle between them and the great port of Antwerp on the northern coast of Belgium. Stubborn resistance by outnumbered American forces in the difficult terrain of the Ardennes canceled out much of the initial material advantages and surprise the Germans enjoyed. On December 22, Patton's Third Army began attacking the German southern flank north of Arlon, and on the 23rd, the weather finally cleared, allowing Allied air supremacy to be re-asserted over the battlefield.<br/><br/>As the German player, can you break through the American player's front lines and get sufficient forces across the Meuse River before the Allies can bring enough reinforcements to the threatened sector to stop the Ardennes Offensive? Play Tigers in the Mist and discover what might have been.<br/><br/>From the GMT website:<br/>An impulse based movement and combat system which forces both sides to hoard reserves to respond to both opportunity and disaster on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Four scenarios playable in one-to-five hours, including an introductory scenario, two tournament scenarios of three hour duration, and a campaign scenario which covers the first week of the battle.<br/><br/>Rules, charts, and examples are organized for ease of use.

The system is set up such that a numbered area is always adjacent to consecutive areas in the numbering sequence, ie. 75 is adjacent to 74 and 76. Areas are connected by roads. Brown lines are minor roads. Gray lines are major roads. Units move from area to area along roads.

Arne is cheeky, creative, and chaotic. And always spiced with the most unexpected turns. As a player, you change the direction of the game, take over someone&rsquo;s turn, protect your own cards, steal someone else&rsquo;s and wreck the strategy of your opponents. Your luck can turn at any moment: Arne literally goes every which way.<br/><br/>Arne is suitable for all ages. A few practice games, and children from the age of seven start playing seriously. Boys and girls mainly enjoy the high tease factor of the game. But the countless combination possibilities make the game just as much fun for adults. You don&rsquo;t have to know Arne inside out to score well: luck plays an important part. Parents, children, grandparents &hellip; everybody&rsquo;s chances for winning are the same.<br/><br/>There are no words printed on the Arne cards. So the game is universal: people of various mother tongues can play together perfectly well. Another great advantage is that the game does not take long to play: a round of Arne takes ten minutes, a quarter of an hour at the most. However, you will not know who is winning until the last cards have been played. Those who have saved plenty of points can be sent back to the beginning by just one card. And those who were not doing well can snatch victory at the very last minute.<br/><br/>How ARNE Works!<br/><br/>Whoever collects most points wins. Each player first chooses a color and then goes and tries to collect as many points of that color as possible. The other players try to do the same. The point of the game is to sabotage their attempts as much as possible. You do this by making use of the teaser cards. In order to make the game even more fun, there are two sorts of cards:<br/><br/>White cards which you may only play when it is your turn <br/>Black cards which you may play whenever you want to<br/><br/>In practice, all players can play cards at the same time. This means that the tease factor is very high indeed.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Arne Total<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"61755": "Fundex edition"}, "name": "Arne", "playingtime": "15", "average": "3.6136", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "161", "boardgamefamily": {"18056": "Arne"}}, "4129": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Snapshot", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2019": "Partnerships"}, "yearpublished": "1989", "usersrated": "23", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic130022_t.jpg", "average": "5.32609", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"553": {"name": "Cadaco"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic130022.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"98365": "Cadaco Edition 1990"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1039": {"name": "Deduction"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Players / Teams try to identify what is shown in the black and white pictures that are revealed one section at a time.<br/><br/>"}, "4130": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic12592.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"643": {"name": "Robert J.

The fighting that month, north of the besieged city of Mantua, proved to be one of the first great challenges in the young General Bonaparte's career. Two Austrian forces under Marshal Alvinczy and Lt. General Davidovitch threatened to converge on the French from the north and east, join together at Verona, and march southwards to raise the siege. Bonaparte's task was to make use of his interior lines around Verona to unite his scattered and out-numbered troops, and defeat the separate wings of the Austrian &quot;pincers&quot; in detail.<br/><br/>BATTLE for ITALY is Avalon Hill's new strategy game for two players which recreates the critlcal period of November. 1796. During a typical game turn, both players attempt to move their brigades by normal and forced marches. Combat occurs when opposing forces move adjacent to each other. and is resolved by a die roll on the Combat Results Table. Important leaders on both sides are represented in play, and their Individual attributes are critical to each players success.

In all essential details the &quot;Hyena Game&quot; seems to have been identical to the Ancient Egyptian game of Mehen (The Game of the Coiled One).  The board's shape suggests it may be a distant ancestor of the Game of Goose but the mechanics are so different that this is probably a coincidence.<br/><br/>It was played on a spiraling track, employed stick dice (throwing sticks) of precisely the kind known from Archaic Egyptian contexts, and had two types of pieces, one representing a predatory animal.  The only difference would seem to be that the ancient Egyptians allotted six counters to each player rather than only one.  The Cretan Phaistos Disc may have been a Mehen board, but that remains speculation.<br/><br/>Mehen is the only multi-player ancient Egyptian board game known, the others (Senet, Aseb, Hounds &amp; Jackals, etc.) being all two-player games.  The main function of the serpent-shaped Egyptian god Mehen was to protect the sun-god Ra from his enemies by coiling around him.  In the Old Kingdom, the race-game Mehen took the name and shape of the god: a coiled serpent with the gaming spaces on its back.  As &quot;bodyguard&quot;, Mehen symbolises the sun-god's immediate neighborhood for the deceased.  The deceased walks towards Ra on the back of the serpent-god.<br/><br/>By the early Middle Kingdom, the &lsquo;cuts&rsquo; used on the snake's back of the Mehen board to separate the playing spaces were thought to &lsquo;kill&rsquo; the snake &mdash;which would have been a very threatening and evil thing.  Mehen&rsquo;s role was essential, for if Ra were not protected from his enemies, he might not rise in the morning, which would result in the cessation of all life.  In Egyptian belief, &lsquo;life&rsquo; applied not only to the living but also to the dead, who were believed to travel with the sun and to rise, reborn, with him at dawn.  From that time forth, the game apparently ceased to be played, possibly banned and forbidden.<br/><br/>"}, "4149": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Barrel of Monkeys", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "1965", "usersrated": "620", "boardgamefamily": {"5607": "3D Games"}, "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic336380_t.jpg", "average": "3.6333", "statistics": {}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4665": "Children's Games"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic336380.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"100558": "German edition"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamepublisher": {"8468": {"name": "Club Earth"}}, "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "3", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Did you know that this is not just a children's toy, but also a game?<br/><br/>Try to hook a chain of monkeys until you stop or your chain falls apart.

The game is a fictional representation of the breakout of World War II. Five minor countries become engulfed in a tremendous conflict for territory waged by Great Blue and Big Red, the major countries.<br/><br/><br/>Blitzkrieg is one of the classic Avalon Hill war games that set up the military simulation board game hobby.<br/><br/>Blitzkrieg is a board game with printed cardboard square pieces played on a hard mapboard. The mapboard is hard paper stock that is the same as what one would find with a Monopoly playboard. Printed on the mapboard is a map on a hexagonal grid (hex spaces, or simply &quot;hexes&quot;), and terrain for land, beach, cities, rivers, roads, mountain, desert, and borders. There are a few charts, such as the one for the combat results table, and a die for random outcomes.<br/><br/>The cardboard pieces represent large military units. There are brigades, divisions, squadrons and air wings. The different types of military units represented are infantry, airborne, rangers, armor, shock artillery, fighters and bombers. Navel action is allowed but abstracted.<br/><br/>There are three levels of the game, the basic game (simplest), advanced (all the complicated rules), and tournament (fast play with advance rules). There are optional rules for the advanced game. The basic game only includes the land game, no naval invasions, and is the best starter tool for new gamers. The basic game has a more simplified combat results table. The advanced game adds special unit abilities, supply restrictions, air war and strategic bombing, naval invasions, commando raids, special desert supply restrictions, etc. Tournament play was intended for play at game conventions such as the annual world board-gaming convention in Harrisburg, Pa.<br/><br/>The nice thing about Blitzkrieg is that it uses a system that is similar to most other hexgames. So once one learns one game, the learning curve of a similar game was not as steep. Such is the case with many of the old Avalon Hill Classics, once you learned one game all of the other played the same way with some minor variation, only the campaign is different.<br/><br/>The basic play used unit types and combat ratings. As expected, infantry would have different abilities from armor or artillery. Each unit had rating printed in large print on the piece, (or &quot;chits,&quot; as they are called). For example, take a 1-4 infantry brigade. The &quot;4&quot; is the movement factor per turn, so the unit can move four hexes in clear terrain per turn. Movement along a road is 1/3, so a 1-4 infantry can move 12 hexes if moved solely along a road. Each side is permitted to move all of their units up to their full movement allowance. The first rating, the &quot;1&quot; in this case, is the combat factor. Combat is worked out in odds, so that if one moves his 1-4 infantry next to the enemies&rsquo; 1-4 infantry, the combat odds are 1-1 (not very good in combat). There is nothing preventing one from ganging up on an enemy unit, and in fact this is the general tactic even in real life. So if one brought up another brigade into the attack there would be two 1-4 infantry brigades against the enemy's single brigade for 2-1 odds. For example, if the enemy had a 4-4 infantry division sitting on a clear hex and on their turn a player brings up three 4-4 infantry divisions adjacent to have combat, this would be at 12-4 odds, which reduce to 3-1. Then one would consult the combat results table under the 3-1 column and roll the die. The results would resolve the combat and tell what losses there were, and who had to retreat. Obviously, the higher the odds will favor that side.<br/><br/>Also in combat, terrain would impact combat. A defender in a city or mountain would have their defense rating doubled. For example, a 1-4 infantry in the mountains would defend as a combat rating of 2. Odds are rounded in favor of the defender. From the example above if that 4-4 infantry was defending in a city against those three 4-4 infantry, the odds would now be 12-8, only 1-1 odds (better bring up more attacking troops).<br/><br/>When Blitzkrieg came out this type of map wargame was relatively new, so this game was very novel in its time. It is still a good two player game and there is enough variation so it won't get stale. It has a WWII or early cold war feel to it. The two antagonists are abstract, Big Red and Great Blue, which had more to do with the simple printing colors Avalon Hill used back in the early 1960's than any national commentary.<br/><br/>In the late seventies and eighties many panned Blitzkrieg since many games seem to grind to a stalemate in the middle of the map. But as a training game this isn't such a bad thing, since that can give a new gamer some confidence to play to a draw.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"29264": "Avalon Hill First Edition"}, "name": "Blitzkrieg", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "635", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "average": "5.83169"}, "4169": {"boardgamedesigner": {"33": {"name": "Ian Livingstone"}}, "average": "5.45882", "poll": {}, "name": "Deathtrap Dungeon: Card Game", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "4", "yearpublished": "1998", "usersrated": "17", "boardgamefamily": {"131": "Climbing Games"}, "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic20438_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"1657": "Martin McKenna"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"971": {"name": "EIDOS Interactive"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic20438.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"76339": "Eidos First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "The Deathtrap Dungeon card game came with some copies of the PC version of the Deathtrap Dungeon computer game by EIDOS.

The quicker you do it the better. All the cards are dealt out and the player who gets the 'Exploding Pig' starts by discarding the Pig and another card.<br/><br/>Players arrange their cards into sets, e.g. Orcs, Skeletons, Bloodbeasts etc, and the first player puts down any number of cards from the same set, face up. The next player can then play if they can put down the same number of cards, but with a higher value. Therefore Four Skeletons, which are worth 3 each, could be followed by Four Warriors, which are worth 5 each. If a player cannot do this, they pass and play moves on to the next player.<br/><br/>The winner of the hand is the last player to put down the set with the highest value. This person then starts the next round. A note is made of the order the players finish in, and they are then ranked:<br/><br/>Winner = The Big Hero! <br/>2nd place = The Hero <br/>2nd to last place = The Wimp <br/>Last place = The Total Wimp!<br/><br/>The cards are shuffled and re-dealt for the second round, but before the game begins again, The Total Wimp must hand over their 2 highest cards to The Big Hero and the Big Hero gives back any two of their cards. This also happens with The Wimp and The Hero. The game continue until 4 rounds have been played.<br/><br/>There are also Special cards in the deck. Also included are Chaindog and Red Lotus, two player characters from the computer game, and can be used to add to any set, however played on their own they have a value of 0.

Veracruz is an operational simulation of General Winfield Scott's Mexican campaign, which took place between March and September 1847. The invasion was an American effort to end the Mexican War by marching into the heart of Central Mexico to capture the capital, Mexico City. Diplomatically, it ended the decades of border disputes and opened up vast new territories, which in turn led to the Gold Rush of '49 and the Great Compromise of 1850.<br/><br/>European commanders and military experts, when viewing the upcoming conflict in 1846, could not see anything but a complete Mexican victory, given the size of her army with it's European system of training and assembly.

The entire system was exacerbated by a succession of generals and other leaders who were inept on a scale that dwarfs even the darkest Union days of the Civil War. On the other hand, many of the best generals of the American Civil War distinguished themselves here as lieutenants and captains: Robert E. Lee (engineers, Scott's chief scout), Ulysses S.

The rules accommodate both 15mm and 25mm figures.<br/><br/>From publisher (Nov 2009):<br/>Armies of Arcana 5th Edition Softcover Rule book (Published by Terrain Warehouse)<br/><br/>Armies of Arcana, fifth edition is a major revamp of the fourth and is in full colour. It contains 132 pages including templates and reference charts.<br/><br/>Though this is a new edition it has not reworked the original rules only reorganised the layout for better reading. Most sections have been rewritten with the purpose of clarity.<br/><br/>The fourth edition was published in 2002 and as such was not a true fourth version of the rules more of a combining of the three separate editions. The fifth edition brings the publication up to today&rsquo;s high standards.<br/><br/>So what&rsquo;s different or new, what have we done? Well the main thing we have done is to combined the last few years of work on the forum with the existing edition and to expand the scope of the concept which is Arcana.<br/><br/>The fifth edition will not come alone it now comes complete with a new Armies of Acrana website.<br/> The Book<br/><br/>First it&rsquo;s now all colour with a new foreword and introduction in which we expanded the background of Arcana to give it some extra meaning. Then the book is divided into sections, the first is the basics principles with a new learn to play section for those who are new to wargaming.<br/><br/>The second section contains all the turn sequences reworked to follow the actual turn sequence. Again some sections have been updated to follow what has been developed for the forum, especially the flying section.<br/><br/>The next section is &lsquo;To Battle&rsquo; - this has had a major reworking. We have added terrain generators, a new scenario - Attrition, tournament rules. In the army building section we have revamped the vehicle, war machine and creature creation parts all now carry example of how to make them and are much easier to read and use.<br/><br/>The spells have had little done to them other than some realigning by Thane.<br/><br/>The last section contains the army lists and templates.

Some launched themselves to safety before it was too late, but others were slow or miscalculated.  Their sky born heirs were mutated, some horribly beyond belief, others invisibly.  The centuries passed and the radioactivity began to fade away.  The sky cities began to look for ways downward to the planet.

Your objective is to capture or destroy your enemies, and find an opening in the radiation belts.<br/><br/>WAR OF THE SKY CITIES is an exciting two-player science fiction table top game, where players become rulers of complete cities in the sky.  Each side has small scout/research centers, medium battle cities, and/or large battle cities.  There are two objectives: capture or destroy your enemies and find an opening in the deadly radiation belts surrounding a future Earth.  In addition, optional rules introduce the use of small fighter craft and airborne landing parties.

The tile must be moved further away from the South Pole (the centre of Pangea) than it already is, must remain a part of the same continent and must be attached to a continent with that player's herds.

Most of the Soviet forces, including the mobile reserves, were thrown into disarray by the German first strike and were eliminated piecemeal.<br/><br/>On June 28 the Germans closed their first major pocket of the war in the east. It extended from Belostok (Bialystok) to Minsk. 287,000 Soviet troops surrendered in this pocket, and in addition 2585 tanks and 1449 guns were captured. By July 3 the German forces had swept Belorussia of Soviet resistance with the single exception of the garrison at the fortress at Brest. From there they drove on to their next objectives of Smolensk and the Dnieper River, and from there towards Moscow.<br/><br/>Army Group Center is a two player game in which one player controls the German forces, the other the Soviet.<br/><br/>The game is presented in three separate scenarios, the first historical, the second and third hypothetical. The historical scenario is largely a one-sided affair and should be played by those wishing to glean the historical lessons of the German blitzkrieg campaign. For those wishing more balanced play, the second and third scenarios are recommended in which a hypothetical situation is postulated where the Soviets were aware of the German invasion plans and had prepared accordingly.<br/><br/>Army Group Center was published by 3W in 1993.

Next, each player places their alien chit on the center square of their edge of the board (on the grid, but outside the fence). They take turns moving the alien up to 3 spaces, and then they may choose to tip cows. Tipping starts from the alien and stops at a Cow Lock -- the alien cannot tip a cow directly into a cow of the same color.

Why not this?<br/><br/>The second reason is that we at Placebo Press could not possibly believe that an actual human being, no matter how depraved or intoxicated, would participate in such an activity outside of the confines of a harmless board game?

The mighty aircraft carriers and escorting capital ships must be protected from the devastating firepower of modern missiles, torpedoes, and bomb attacks. Attack submarines threaten the enemy task forces and replenishment convoys while searching out their submerged rivals.

Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.<br/><br/>Note: The 2012 edition of Star Munchkin from Pegasus Spiele includes the first expansion, Star Munchkin 2: The Clown Wars.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"258664": "English edition 2015"}, "average": "6.14918", "name": "Star Munchkin", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "3775", "boardgameaccessory": {"187880": "Munchkin: Blank Cards"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"5496": "Thematic Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"24": "Munchkin"}}}
