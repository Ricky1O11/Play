It lies in the heart of southern Gondor and, aside from Lamedon, it is the westernmost of the Stone-land's wellsettled regions.<br/><br/>Gondor's two most famous havens, the princely city of Dol Amroth and nearby Elven port of Edhellond, are both in Dor-en-Ernil. Undoubtedly the most dramatic harbors in the South Kingdom, their history embodies the grander tale of the Gondorian seafarers and their Elven friends, and it mirrors the struggles of the region's oft-times warring peoples.<br/><br/>Of course, Dor-en-Ernil is home to many lesser havens, including the fine harborage at Linhir. Together these towns house many of Gondor's seamen, and virtually all the ships which do not weigh anchor in the three maritime towns along the Anduin River: the great port-city of Pelargir, Harlond by Minas Tirith, and Osgiliath. Dor-en-Ernil's ports also provide a major portion of the warcraft engaged in the struggle against the Corsairs of Umbar and Harad.<br/><br/>"}, "48112": {"rpg": {"284": "Middle-earth Role Playing (1st & 2nd Editions)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Sea-lords of Gondor: Pelargir and Lebennin", "rpgproducer": {"18536": "Sylvie Bellamy"}, "usersrated": "7", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic535138.jpg", "rpgitemversion": {"18465": "Los Se\u00f1ores del Mar de Gondor"}, "rpgsetting": {"259": "Middle-earth"}, "average": "6.77857", "rpgissuearticle": {"39154": "Frontlines"}, "rpggenre": {"257": "Action / Adventure (Nautical)"}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"290": "Middle-earth Role Playing Campaign Modules"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic535138_t.jpg", "description": "Cover/Jacket Text:<br/><br/>Challenge Pirates and Haradrim as you sail across the Bay of Belfalas.

On the maps of the Northern world the region is a labeled Far Harad. The people who dwell there have passed in and out of sight of Middle-earth's great powers, but in times of great conflict between light and dark, such remote regions have been left to fend for themselves in favor of more important lands to the north. Thus, this piece of land, while it has been swayed by outsiders, has always been given time to return to its traditional ways when greater nations grow distracted.<br/><br/>The land of Far Harad is mostly taken up by the broad deserts of Haradwaith. Its northern boundaries are lost in the desert haze some leagues south of Umbar. To the south and east stand badlands where the farthest flung fingers of Haradan civilization fall well short of touching the neighboring states. To the west swells the endless sea. At the nation's center is its only reasonably fertile area, Raj, where an inlet from the sea and a fair-sized river, the Rijesha, bring moisture to the soil. The remainder of the territory holds little more than rocky hills and a half-score eases. The sun is blazing hot in the daytime and unyielding until nightfall.<br/><br/>Where the Rijesha meets the ocean inlet stands the region's largest settlement, known to some by its Westron name of Harshport. To its people, it is called Bozisha-Dar, or &quot;Gift of the Goddess&quot; in Apysaic. Harshport is a hedge-podge of cultural styles, where that of the native population is generally dominant, but the power of Umbar and old N&uacute;menor can be seen and felt. A more traditional settlement is found across the Hills of the Moon from the Oar in the forest known as The Gaj. The town is Tresti, or &quot;Rock,&quot; named for the stone that built it. Tresti's citizens are almost all of pure Haradan descent and are a proud and powerful people.<br/><br/>Though the land has ever been only loosely involved in the great affairs of the North, the history of its people is rich and colorful, and there is plenty room for adventure and high living here under the southern sun of Far Harad.<br/><br/>NOTE: Far Harad also links with the WARLORDS of the Desert and FOREST of Tears adventure modules.<br/><br/>"}, "48121": {"rpgitemversion": {"3951": "Saddle Stapled (modules/pamphlets)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Campaign Book 1: Rhodesia", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic616407.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "average": "4", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"1384": "MERC: A Modern Role Playing Game of Counter Insurgency"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "rpggenre": {"550": "Modern"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic616407_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's description:<br/><br/>&quot;Merc: Campaign Book One: Rhodesia will give players all the pertinent information they will need to historically run their respective campaigns within Rhodesia.

This is the original version of the game, which went through several iterations before ultimately appearing as a boxed game as Railway Rivals and Dampfross. It was designed by David Watts, a Welsh geography teacher and train buff.<br/><br/>It was always intended first and foremost to be a good game to play, but David also wanted to use it for general education &ndash; explaining why railway lines were laid where they were, etc. The game is fundamentally straightforward &ndash; players build railway lines on a map (a tesselation of hexagons) with towns, rivers, hills, coastlines, etc. After a building phase there is then a racing phase &ndash; players race between randomly generated combinations of towns. Players with the most extensive efficient networks tend to win more races, and thus the game.<br/><br/>It always existed as 'just' a set of rules, with a number of official or unofficial maps available from various sources. The earliest and crudest manifestation was just a few (5 or 6) A4 hexagon sheets, and colouring instructions to make the maps up. When postal games players showed considerable enthusiasm for the game, David moved on to produce large size (slightly bigger than A2) hexagon sheets, also with colouring instructions. Later on the maps were printed in one colour on big maps, which you could colour highlight yourself, and cover with sticky-back plastic sheets, so that maps could be reused if water-based pens were used that could be washed off. Multicolour maps followed, which were later printed with a laminate covering.<br/><br/>The railways cost more if you go over mountains etc, but this gives you shorter routes. You can run parallel to other lines at a cost, or simply link into another player's track and rent the tracks of other players when you race.<br/><br/>The mechanics are very simple, and there is some luck involved with the random races that appear, and in racing. Nevertheless, the better players nearly always come out on top. Despite the apparent simplicity, there are plenty of opportunities for thoughtful play, especially with tactics such as blocking other players out of areas of the map.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"155269": "Rostherne First Edition"}, "average": "7.1875", "name": "Railway Rivals", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2010": "Crayon Rail System"}, "age": "11", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "8", "boardgamefamily": {"7988": "Railway Rivals"}}, "48160": {"rpgitemversion": {"97361": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Victoriana (1st Edition)", "rpgproducer": {"15609": "John Tuckey"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic520239.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "rpgsetting": {"26045": "Victoriana"}, "average": "7.33333", "rpgissuearticle": {"77001": "Non D20 Product Reviews"}, "rpggenre": {"167": "History (Alternative)"}, "rpg": {"1726": "Victoriana (1st Edition)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic520239_t.jpg", "description": "This is the core rulebook for the 1st edition of the Victoriana RPG.<br/><br/>This an alternate history game set in London, 1867.

Characters who dare confront the horde soon discover that these particular hobgoblins worship Tiamat, the evil queen of dragons, and eventually come face-to-face with her draconic minions. The excerpts below include the introduction and adventure outline, two sample encounters, and statistics for the encounters. (Crafty DMs may find the encounters and their relevant statistics useful in other ways, too!)<br/><br/>Introduction<br/><br/>The dry hilltops danced with fire.<br/><br/>Throughout the heart of the wild badlands the humans called the Wyrmsmokes, great bonfires had been kindled atop the ridges overlooking Elsir Vale. There thousands of warriors had gathered -- hobgoblins in armor dyed scarlet, thick-thewed bugbear berserkers, goblin worg riders and skirmishers and archers, and the scaled ones as well, who often towered over the rest. For so long they had fought each other, tribe against tribe, race against race, engaged in the endless test of battle, feud, and betrayal. But tonight . . . tonight they stood together, hated enemies shoulder-to-shoulder, shouting together as brothers. And they saw that they were strong, and together they danced and sang and shook their blades at the smoke-hidden stars overhead.<br/><br/>&quot;We are the Kulkor Zhul!&quot; they shouted, and the hills shook with the thunder of their voices. &quot;We are the People of the Dragon! Uighulth na Hargai! None can stand before us!&quot;<br/><br/>One by one the tribes fell silent. Armor creaked as thousands turned to look up to the Place of Speaking. There, a single champion emerged from the assemblage and slowly climbed the ancient stone stair cut into the side of the hill. A hundred bright yellow banners stood beneath him like a phalanx of spears, each marked with a great red hand. The warpriests holding the banners chanted battle-prayers in low voices as the champion ascended.<br/><br/>On the hundredth step he stopped and turned to face the waiting warriors. He was tall and strong, one of the hobgoblin chieftains, but dull blue scales gleamed along his shoulders, and jutting horns swept back from his head. &quot;I am Azarr Kul, Son of the Dragon!&quot; he cried. &quot;Hear me, warriors of the Kulkor Zhul! Tomorrow we march to war!&quot;<br/><br/>The warriors roared their approval, stamping their feet and clashing spear to shield. Azarr Kul waited, holding his hands aloft until they quieted again. &quot;The warpriests of the Doom Hand have shown us the way! They have taught us honor, discipline, obedience -- and strength! No more will we waste our blood fighting each other. We will take the lands of the elf, the dwarf, and the human, and make them ours! Under the banner of the Red Hand of Doom we march to victory and conquest! Remember that you stood here this night, warriors of Kulkor Zhul! For a hundred generations your sons and your sons' sons will sing of the blood spilled by your swords and the glory you win in the nights to come! Now, my brothers -- to WAR!&quot;<br/><br/>The burning hills were too small to hold the shout the Kulkor Zhul gave in answer to their warlord's call.<br/><br/>War is gathering in the dry brown hills known as the Wyrmsmoke Mountains. As midsummer settles over the land, smothering everything in heat and dust, the fierce warriors of the Kulkor Zhul -- &quot;People of the Dragon&quot; in the hobgoblin tongue -- gather beneath the dreaded Red Hand banner, ready to sweep down out of the Wyrmsmokes and conquer the human lands below. Your player characters face an onslaught of fire and steel the likes of which few have ever seen.<br/><br/>Encounter Levels:Red Hand of Doom is designed for a party of four characters who begin the adventure at 5th level. Over the course of the adventure they should accumulate enough experience to reach 10th level before the climactic encounters at the end of the adventure.<br/><br/>From the back of the book<br/><br/>Who can stand against the Son of the Dragon?<br/><br/>The Wyrmsmoke Mountains shook with the thunder of ten thousand screaming hobgoblin soldiers.  From the phalanx emerged a single champion.  One by one the tribes fell silent as the warlord rose up, blue scales gleaming along his shoulders, horns swept back from his head.  A hundred bright yellow banners stood beneath him, each marked with a great red hand.  He stood upon a precipice and raised his arms.  &quot;I am Azarr Kul, Son of the Dragon!&quot; the warlord bellowed, &quot;Hear me! Tomorrow we march to war!&quot;<br/><br/>Red Hand of Doom is a Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure designed to take characters from the 6th level to the 12th level.  Confronted with the relentless advance of Azurr Kull's horde, the characters must undertake vital missions to influence the outcome of the war.  Can they shatter the armies of the enemy, or will Azarr Kul's dreams rain destruction upon the human lands?<br/><br/>Expanded by;<br/>Red Hand of Doom Creature Appendix<br/><br/>"}, "48337": {"rpg": {"244": "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Eye of Pain", "rpgproducer": {"17178": "Miranda Horner"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic515428.jpg", "usersrated": "11", "rpgitemversion": {"219170": "PDF version"}, "average": "6.70455", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"1748": "I, Tyrant"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic515428_t.jpg", "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>Inside the woods near Burke's Crossing lurks a very real danger.  it began as a sense of unease, a feeling of being watched.
