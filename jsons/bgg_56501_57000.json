Trees, plants, animals, microorganisms, monsters, pitfalls, and climates are all included - the complete cycle of life is defined.<br/><br/>Along with each of the environments are a wide variety of skills, substances, spells, concoctions, devices, gear, and information invaluable for dealing with the specific hazards of the wilds.

Each adventure is fully detailed with NPCs (over thirty new characters!), layouts, bases, and everything else a GM needs to run the scenario.<br/><br/>ADVENTURE NUMBER ONE: Can you stop the evil villain group Spectrum, as they attempt to take Washington D.C. by storm in order to pass a paranormal restriction act? A pulse-pounding, no-holds-barred climactic battle on capitol hill finishes off this incredible adventure written by Scott Sigler.<br/><br/>ADVENTURE NUMBER TWO: Its called No News of a Thaw, and this adventure involving ice demons, other dimensions, and a quest to save the world from domination by creatures of terrible cold is as off-beat as they get &mdash; but a challenge for any heroes worthy the name. Written by Phil Masters.<br/><br/>ADVENTURE NUMBER THREE: The final installment in this incredible trilogy is Menace Out of Time, written by Dean and Dana Edgell. As it's name would imply, this adventure involves time travel, both with the villain Tempus ripping things from various times to menace the characters, and the heroes chasing their foe through time. Nazis, robots, war gods, futuristic lawmen, ghosts and dinosaurs are the heroes' adversaries in this mind-boggling battle through time. Can your heroes keep from becoming marooned in the distant past? And if so, can they face the final, startling conclusion of the Menace Out of Time?<br/><br/>"}, "56599": {"rpgdesigner": ["Rob Bell", "Chad Brinkley", "Tom Reed", "Andrew Robinson", "David Rogers", "Rodford E.

Basically this game is a duel, but the rules introduce also other ways to win - dimplomacy, intrigues and using military force. At once up to 5 sides - factions - can play.<br/><br/>The plot of the game is settled in the historical reality of the 17th century, Poland's heyday, the times of the gentry, covering Europe and Asia. The designers also referred to the Polish historical and contemporary prose, like Henryk Sienkiewicz (Nobel prize winner) and Jacek Komuda.<br/><br/>In 2009 Ku\u017ania Gier became the publisher of the game. This new publisher reprinted the basic decks designed by Wydawnictwo Imperium and added a new starter deck of Osmanowie (the Ottoman Empire - this faction was introduced by the Casus Belli expansion in boosters). Ku\u017ania Gier released their first own expansion in 2009 and further two in 2010. The line is constantly expanded with new products.<br/><br/>Veto CCG has now seasons of the game (each season starts with releasing a set of sarter decks and contains next three expansions), which is connected with rotation of legal cards in the organized tournament system. So far Veto has had three full seasons: basic season (Veto 2ed, Charakternicy, Casus Belli, Ogniem i Mieczem), Warcho\u0142y i Pijanice (eng. &quot;Dipsos and Troublemakers&quot;, inlcuding Ogniem i Mieczem (partly), Do szabel, R\u0119baj\u0142owie, Krwi) and Szpiedzy i Dyplomaci (&quot;Spies and Dimplomats&quot;, including W niewoli, Spiskowcy, Kr&oacute;lob&oacute;jstwo).

A fun family card game based on a simple idea: Players race each other to complete a run of numbered &quot;Lap&quot; cards; then be the first to play the checkered flag card to win the game.<br/>But there&rsquo;s a catch. Pitstop cards lurk in the deck and they can ruin any dreams of a quick win.<br/>A game of Pitstop can be fast and furious because players can play all the cards in their hand in one turn and Lady Luck, in the form of prized wild cards, can make or break a racing career in a hurry.<br/><br/>One of the best things about Pitstop is that it can take as little as 5 minutes for one game or all day for a Pitstop tournament. Race Season rules are included for a 10-race, 20-race or whatever-race competition.<br/><br/>The game consists of 108 unique, racing-themed plastic-coated playing cards, divided into two decks.

Although small in number and incognito in guise, these spies daily betray trusts, seed lies and mistruths, steal high-tech secrets and even poison rivals -- all in pursuit of their patrons' power. Even the Church plays these games of death and deceit, using ill-gotten secrets to sway their secular rivals -- or protect them from a greater darkness.<br/><br/>Anarchists and discontents lurk in these same shadows, seeking to topple the current order and replace it with their own.

Only the noble, guild and Church intelligence agencies can possibly protect the common folk from the machinations of these rebels and terrorists.<br/><br/>Spies &amp; Revolutionaries is the first volume in the Secret Societies series. Herein, Sir Chamon Mazarin, the Emperor's spymaster, presents dossiers on a plethora of underground organizations throughout the Known Worlds, from spies to terrorists and revolutionaries.

But you do not take all cards, only the cards that meet one of these requirements:<br/><br/>1. color is the same as just played, or <br/>2. number is the same or lower than just played<br/><br/>The game ends when the draw deck is exhausted or when one player has collected all six colors in their point piles. Then everyone plays one last card. From the four cards remaining in their hand, players choose two cards to add to his or her point piles. The player who has the least negative points after this is the winner.<br/><br/>Scoring:<br/>Normally, negative points are same the number on the card.

A New Dark Age has descended upon humanity, for the greatest of civilizations has fallen and now even the stars are dying.

Players can take on any role they desire, from imperious nobles, lords of the planets of the Known Worlds, to zealous priests from the many sects of the Universal Church, to guild members with secret technology, or aliens from the many races subjugated under human rule. But enemies are many: jealous nobles, angry priests, greedy merchants, powerful warlocks, bizarre cults, the genetically altered and a host of other secret enemies.<br/><br/>Fading Suns is a science fiction game of heavy combat, vicious politics, weird occultism, alien secrets and artifacts, and unknown and un-mapped worlds.

Few are privy to their lifestyles and secrets, and the great unwashed understand little of the perks (and problems) associated with rulership. There are taxes to collect, wars to wage, and rivals to crush. Indeed, as any noble would tell you, the sacrifices they endure more than justify their opulent lifestyles. Not just anybody can be such a martyr; it takes blood privilege. A privilege the nobility protects at all costs, even if it requires deadly duels or declarations of war.<br/><br/>Herein are detailed the histories and sociologies of the five Royal Houses, 10 minor houses and alien nobility: Ur-Obun councilmembers, Ur-Ukar chieftains and Vorox lords.<br/><br/>Priests of the Celestial Sun<br/>The nobles may rule the secular lives of the Known Worlders, but the Church guards their souls - and in so doing, dictates to the nobility. Few lords dare to defy the will of the Patriarch and his bishops. But the Church's rock is not as stable as it once was - new sects and orders have appeared in the wake of the Emperor Wars, shifting the populace's loyalties and reawakening ancient heresies. While the Church stands united against the powers of the Emperor, the Royal Houses and the Merchant League, they feud within their cathedrals, vying for dominion over the faithful.<br/><br/>Herein are detailed the lives of the saints, the histories and beliefs of the major sects of the Church, the heretical Incarnates and the religion of the Children of Zuran.<br/><br/>"}, "56772": {"rpgdesigner": ["Lance Hawvermale", "Robert J.

The Church claims that these former monuments of human genius eclipsed the grace of the Pancreator with hubris, that humanity must but worship one god and not be beholden to the false totems of reason. In the New Dark Age, few dare ignite the fires of knowledge, to shed light into the dark places humanity once walked with certainty. Visionaries are rare; branded as heretic, anarchist or republican. The Church turns ignorant eyes to more sacred visions instead. Engineers pick over the remnants of a bygone era in the hope of recovering some of that former enlightenment.

Thought a miserable failure on its original release in 1982, the movie went on to be restructured into the Final Cut, the definitive vision of this landmark film.<br/><br/>This Unofficial Roleplaying Game is assuming two things:<br/><br/>1. That you, the player, is fully aware of what the Blade Runner universe is all about and that you have not only seen the film but understand the underlying themes as well as appreciate the imagery.<br/><br/>2. That you have played roleplaying games before and are therefore fully capable of running a game with little to no advice or instruction.<br/><br/>This game is also going to not only take it primary cues from the movie but from other source material, such as the original Philip K Dick novel Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep, the K W Jeter novels and the 1997 computer RPG. It will also take some liberties - some of the references and item abilities are vague and somewhat debated, so I have translated them into simple open-ended game terms for ease of use.

You&rsquo;re right! And one that you wrote! Soaps (Where Soap Opera Writers Get Their Ideas) is a card game for 2-5 players for an hour or so, where players are the managers of new soap operas during a trial period: the player whose show draws the highest audience (as determined by what events occur on their soap opera and which characters each involves) will go on to the main season!  Just like real soap operas, the twists and turns of the plots in the game can be unbelievable, outlandish, tragic or funny.<br/><br/>There are two main decks in the game: Events and Characters. Every Event lists what types of characters can be involved and have a point value. Every Character has a sex, a sexual orientation, a point value, and a typecast (a special rule that applies to that character). The strategy lies in developing your soap opera to allow more exciting events as the game progresses.<br/><br/>Soaps is not a spoof on any particular show: it mocks all TV drama.

They wanted to explore, discover, meet and greet aliens and protect their world from the bad guys out there in the deep black.<br/><br/>So think of this game as a comedy version of Flash Gordon mixed with Red Dwarf, Galaxy Quest, Futurama and Star Trek. That'll give you a pretty good indication of what this game is all about.<br/><br/>You can run the game deeper than that if you wish - there's no reason why you can't - but you&rsquo;ll have to improvise the extras. These rules just cover the adventure side of things.<br/><br/>"}, "56854": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["HD Pack"], "poll": [], "name": "Pulp Hero (HD Character Pack)", "rpgdesigner": ["Steven S.

They are not always fast, not always reliable, and typically have a lot more &quot;flavor&quot; to them. Sorcery might be a great power, but it&rsquo;s a little bland. What we hoped to do here is make magic a little more... well, a little more magical and mystical.<br/><br/>To this end, we&rsquo;ve created four new systems of magic suitable for use in M&amp;M games which concentrate more on fantasy settings, or for when you just want a different take on a sorcerous character. These magic systems can be used on their own, or as inspiration for how to alter your own game&rsquo;s Sorcery power.<br/><br/>There are also a few new extras and flaws which were created in the process of making these magic powers; we think of them as &quot;tools to make the tools.&quot; Perhaps you might find a use for these on other powers as well.<br/><br/>"}, "56878": {"rpgdesigner": ["John Sasso"], "rpg": ["Human Interface for Fantasy Role Playing"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Human Interface for Fantasy Role Playing (Platinum Edition)", "rpgartist": ["John Sasso", "F.

Greatest among them was one called Ravana, acknowledged by even the most egotistical rakshasa as their rightful king. He had been born into the world many times, growing in power with each incarnation, until finally he brought all mortal races under the power of rakshasa.<br/><br/>However, Ravana's rule was destined to end. He overlooked one particular mortal hero, who was reincarnated time and again, thwarting Ravana's schemes whenever he appeared. Finally, as Ravana was closing his grasp around the last few creatures who resisted his rule, this hero was born into the world one more time.<br/><br/>Under the name Ramachandra, this hero battled Ravana's allies and armies, overcoming them every time with his lethal archery and iron courage. What followed were battles that lasted years and filled the oceans with blood, but finally Ramachandra's bowmanship overcame Ravana's might, and the rakshasa lord was slain.<br/><br/>Rakshasas hold that when they die, they are judged by their great king Ravana. Those who possessed great power and cunning are reborn as even mightier individuals, and the greatest rakshasa will someday return as Ravana. In fact, before his last battle Ravana foretold that he would be reborn one more time into the world, prepared to enslave it forever with his wickedness. But he also warned that his ancient nemesis would return, wielding a flaming sword and mounted on a white horse as noble as himself.<br/><br/>The Complete Guide to Rakshasas takes you into this world of ancient myth and unbridled ambition in a journey where each adventure is merely one episode in an eons-spanning quest.

He quickly considered his options. Three on one was a dangerous fight, even for the greatest swordsman in Trent, especially without armor, and there was no knowing how many more were lurking in the shadows. As the two in front closed on him, spreading to encircle him, Jeteki drew his sword and slipped it past one man's feeble parry and into his gut, dropping him instantly.

One player takes the role of the Doctor in all his regenerations, and his opponent assumes control of his arch enemy, The Master.<br/><br/>At his disposal, the Doctor has a roster of companions from his past to help struggle against the renegade Timelord, featuring Rose Tyler, Romana, Adric, and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, etc. His equipment includes, amongst others, his Sonic Screwdriver, K-9, jelly babies', and the Hand of Omega.<br/><br/>The Master has a wide selection of villainous temporal marauders to choose from: Zygons, Ood, Daleks, Sontarans, Cybermen, Robots of Death, Omega, The Valeyard, Sutekh, and The Rani, etc. He even has the meddlesome option of starting an Interstellar War - much like he did between the Draconians and the Earth Empire in Space War. His deck also features such interesting devices as the Laser Screwdriver, Tissue Compression Eliminator, and a Raston Warrior Robot.<br/><br/>The game has an asymmetrical design, with both decks featuring different cards and abilities. The Twelve Doctors is played using a 3-column time-line system, representing the battle for Gallifrey, Earth present and future, and Earth past. Gameplay is quick and bloodthirsty with companions EX-TER-MI-NATED! frequently, and marauders being dropped into black holes, or destroyed by the well-placed use of Venusian Aikido.<br/><br/>Numerous tricky decisions must be made throughout. For instance, The Master has 3 planets that he can atomise during the course of each game: Telos, Metebelis III, and Skaro. This is in addition to the damage he may wreak upon Earth or Logopolis, etc, through cardplay. Destroying a planet has long-term consequences for the player, as well as short-term benefits. The Doctor, on the other hand, has the Journal of Impossible Things to use, but if he does so, makes the game easier for The Master to win.<br/><br/>Primarily a combat-driven card game, each player must manage his deck of cards effectively to win. In addition to simple, unique abilities, each card also has three values: power, cost, and disrupt. Both player's decks are also a measure of the time they have remaining to thwart each other.<br/><br/>The Twelve Doctors lineage can be traced back to San Juan, Magic: The Gathering, BattleTech CCG, and Iliad.<br/><br/>Victory Conditions:<br/><br/><br/>     Whoever cannot draw a card has lost.<br/>     The Master wins if he disrupts more cards than the Doctor has left in his deck.<br/>     The Master wins if Gallifrey's power is reduced to zero.<br/>     The Master wins if Earth's power is reduced to zero (past and future).<br/>     The Master wins if all 11 incarnations of the Doctor are regenerated/destroyed.<br/>     The Master wins if 5 tokens are placed upon the Wirrn.<br/>     The Doctor wins if all 6 incarnations of the Master are regenerated/destroyed.<br/>     The Doctor wins if 5 tokens are placed upon Lucy Saxon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Whoever gets 5 Key to Time cards in play first wins (expansion victory condition).<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition", "Second Edition"], "average": "7.81493", "name": "The Twelve Doctors: Doctor Who Card Game", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "age": "9", "boardgameexpansion": ["98339", "97949", "104325", "108272", "98272"], "usersrated": "134", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["TV Series: Dr. Who"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 60 - Total Con 2015: Total Remption"]}, "56996": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic567025.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Martyn F"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Peter Hermans"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Emma Games"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic567025_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Territory Building"], "description": "Wadi - The Watchmen is an expansion for Wadi.<br/><br/>Wadi - The Watchmen brings more depth to Wadi.
