DKC is a 2D platform game in which the player controls either Donkey Kong or Diddy Kong, with the other one following his every move when he's present. Whenever the player gets hit by an enemy, his monkey (Donkey or Diddy) leaves and the player can continue with the other one. If there is no second monkey, the player looses a life. The game also allows for cooperative play, where one player is Donkey and the other is Diddy, resulting in alternate gameplay.<br/><br/>In the game, all Donkey Kong's bananas have been stolen by the villain King K. Rool. It's up to the player to clear all levels and eventually defeat King K. Rool and get the bananas back. For this the player has to clear a number of areas on the island, each consisting of multiple levels. Throughout the different areas, there are Kong family members helping the player on his quest by offering transportation, save points and hints. In various levels the player can find helper animals: a parrot, a rhino, an ostrich, a swordfish and a frog. Each of them have their own special abilities.<br/><br/>The game is known for being the first game to extensively use pre-rendered 3D graphics. <br/>There are many secret areas hidden throughout the levels, where bonus bananas and lives can be found. The game keeps track of which bonus levels have been found, and by doing so encourages players to try to find everything resulting in a 100% score. Beside the graphical style the game is also known for it's speed. An experienced player can rush through many of the levels, grabbing bananas, bonuses and passing obstacles. However the choice is with the player, as the fast pace is not mandatory.<br/><br/>"}, "71704": {"rpg": {"2523": "Action!

It was released in 1995 by Nintendo. While in the first game Donkey Kong, together with Diddy Kong, had to get Donkey Kong's bananas hoard back from the bad King K. Rool and his Kremlings, this time it is Donkey Kong himself that was taken by K. Rool. So now Diddy Kong teams up with Dixie Kong to rescue the big ape. Like the other parts in the series, the basic game is a solid 2D platformer with a pre-rendered graphical style, allowing for fast paced gameplay.<br/><br/>In DKC2 there are more hidden bonus areas compared to DKC1. In each bonus area a Kremcoin can be found. There are 75 in the whole game. These coins can be used to open up routes to extra levels in the Lost World. Apart from the kremcoins, the player can also collect Banana coins. These coins are unlimited available, but the amount is not saved with the progress like the rest of the game. These coins can be used to buy hints, buy transportation and save the game. The last type of coins are the DK Coins. In each level there is one DK coin hidden. On the map screen is displayed whether all Kremcoins and the DK coin have been found in a level. As with the first DKC the game challenges the player to find everything hidden in the game.<br/><br/>In DKC2 there are a number of animal buddies, some were present in DKC1 but there are also some new buddies introduced like Rattly the Rattlesnake, Clapper the Seal and Squitter the Spider. In DKC2 there are some parts of levels were the monkeys are turned into an animal buddy and the player has to control the animal buddy, without Diddy or Dixie riding them.<br/><br/>The different worlds in the game are more varied than DKC1, including levels in the following styles: lava, swamp, jungle, underwater, ice, ruins, pirate ship, mines, bee hive and others. The game also features wind in some levels, both horizontally (allowing for big jumps, or adding difficulty when manoeuvring through spikes) and vertically (letting the Kong's float upwards in the level).<br/><br/>"}, "71706": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"307100": "eShop Wii Downloadable edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1127625.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5433": "Donkey Kong Country"}, "videogametheme": {"2337": "Cute Fantasy"}, "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "average": "7.46181", "videogamefranchise": {"5435": "Donkey Kong"}, "videogameplatform": {"4423": "Game Boy Advance"}, "usersrated": "72", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1127625_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>As the final game in the SNES trilogy, Donkey Kong 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble is a platform game featuring plenty of bad guys and tons of secret areas.

Suffering from cash flow problems and falling sales, Turok became Acclaim's best hope for a financial turnaround. Iguana pushed the Nintendo 64's graphics capabilities to its limits, and were forced to compress or cut elements to fit the game on its 8 megabyte cartridge. Bugs delayed the game's release from holiday 1996 to 1997.<br/><br/>Critical reception of Turok was highly positive. Becoming one of the most popular games for the console on release, Turok won praise for its graphics and evolution of the genre. Complaints centered on graphical slowdowns caused by multiple enemies appearing onscreen and occasionally awkward controls. The game sold 1.5 million copies and boosted sales of the Nintendo 64.

Players control the actions of heroic crimefighters or nefarious villains and their henchmen. Each player will have anywhere from 1 to a dozen models whose actions they determine.<br/><br/>Combat is fast and deadly. Using the results of two six-sided dice, players try and fight through the defenses of their opponents. Heroes and Major villains can withstand punishment but their henchman will be falling left and right to slugs, knives and fists.<br/><br/>All characters are pre-generated so players will be ready to go straight from the book. Special abilities will give the major characters an edge over those around them, but even the greatest hero can fall to the villain's henchmen if he is unsupported.<br/><br/>Two experienced players will be able to play out their favorite action from the world of Granton City in about 2 hours on a game space no bigger than a dining room table.<br/><br/>&ldquo;When approached about incorporating the diverse characters from Granton City Press into a table top miniatures game, I thought it was a great idea,&rdquo; said Richard A. Johnson the man behind Rattrap Productions LLC. &ldquo;Initially we tossed around the idea of incorporating the characters into one of our existing games but came to realize there was enough unique and interesting new character in Granton City to support a new game themselves.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Johnson said he had been working on a new game, and it turned out to be a perfect vehicle for characters such as The Black Wolf, The Starling, Ghost Wind and Churchill: Alien Bounty Hunter.    <br/>    <br/>The new game will be an ideal place for the soon to be released Black Wolf miniature from Zombiesmith Miniatures. Watch for more news on the miniature front in the weeks ahead.    Granton City Press expects to have The Black Wolf #1: Metal Monsters of Doom out in April.

Set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, players take on the roles of Space Marines pitted against hordes of Genestealers.<br/><br/>Players choose from six different combat teams, each consisting of two Space Marines with different abilities. Each player receives three Action cards for each of his combat teams. After all of the Space Marines have fallen into formation, prepare for the first wave of Genestealers.<br/><br/>Game play is quick and easy to learn. Each game is played over a series of rounds, broken up into phases. During the Choose Actions Phase, each player must secretly determine which of the following Action cards they wish to play on their Space Marines: Support, Attack, or Move + Activate. You can't pick the same Action card next round, so choose wisely.<br/><br/>Action resolution keeps all players involved while the overwhelming odds inspire them to work together to survive. The Action Resolution Phase consists of each player revealing and carrying out their chosen Action. The lowest number card goes first, which means Attacks are resolved after Supports. Support tokens enable Space Marines to re-roll, so make sure to cover your fellow Blood Angels.<br/><br/>The Genestealer Attack Phase happens after all the Actions have been resolved, so hopefully you thinned out the swarms since you have to roll higher than the number of Genestealers in the swarm to successfully defend. Finally, an Event card is drawn to spawn more alien adversaries. Once all the Genestealers have emerged from the darkness, its time to move forward, drawing a new location card.

The Skull Kid, (a character introduced in The Ocarina of Time) ambushes Link with the help of two fairies, Tatl and Tael. After a wild chase, Link is knocked off of his horse. The Skull Kid, wearing a strange heart-shaped mask, transforms Link into a Deku Sprout. Tatl lingers a bit too long to mock Link and is trapped with him. The two work together to find their way to a clock tower where they meet a strange mask salesman (also introduced in The Ocarina of Time) who promises to help Link in exchange for the mask the Skull Kid wears.<br/><br/>Stepping outside the Clock Tower, we see that a large and terrifying Moon leers over the city. Link, stuck in his Deku Sprout form, roams the city for three days, meeting people and making friends. On midnight of the third day the clock tower opens and Link enters to reach the top. There, a battle starts, but the Skull Kid drops Link's trusty Ocarina and he plays the Song of Time. Time resets to three days prior, where the only person to recognize Link is the mask salesman.<br/><br/>The game takes place in the land of Termina. Link must travel to four distinct areas and solve the problems there. Each land has a temple, in the power of an out of control Deity. He only has three days to complete his quests, so judicious use of the Song of Time is necessary to complete the game. Certain concessions are built-in, including a bank that will store your money and a notebook to keep track of everyone you meet, what days and what times they are available and side quests to be completed. Link remains child-sized throughout the game, however, three masks that change his form are found in each major area. The Deku sprout form is a smaller, more child-like sized creature.

It is closely related to the game One-hundred and ten (110) also described below.<br/><br/>The game may have got its name from &quot;forte&quot; which is Latin for strong which describes the 5's in the deck. The origin of this game is thought to be Ireland.[citation needed] In the 1920s, the game became Forte Fives when it moved South into the Merrimack Valley of Massachusetts and New Hampshire with French Canadian immigrants. Today, Forty-fives continues to be very popular in the Merrimack Valley. It is played with a standard deck of 52 cards (sometimes with jokers).<br/><br/><br/>Taken from the Article: 45s - Merrimack Valley&rsquo;s Original Card Game - as published in Merrimack Valley Magazine:<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>So much about the card game forty-fives doesn&rsquo;t add up.<br/><br/>If in the right suit, the 5 is the best card, a jack beats a king, and a 2 can be better than a 10 &hellip; but only when it wears black. For the uninitiated, it just gets more confusing from there.<br/><br/>Even the name of the game is ambiguous. Some say the name forty-fives refers to the four 5s in the deck, others say it has to do with a Canadian version of the game, in which the goal is to reach 45 points (the Canadians call our version &ldquo;120&rdquo;). Then there&rsquo;s the theory that forty-fives is derived from &ldquo;forte&rdquo; &mdash; meaning strong &mdash; the 5 being the &ldquo;mightiest&rdquo; card. And is it written &ldquo;45s,&rdquo; or &ldquo;forty-fives&rdquo;?<br/><br/>Through all the confusion, however, it all makes sense to legions of forty-fives players around the Merrimack Valley. A game rooted in 19th century Ireland, forty-fives is as popular as ever across the Valley in 2012, whether it&rsquo;s played for fun, in a league, at a fundraiser or even on a computer.<br/><br/>The following rules summary was taken from <a target='_blank' href='http://www.the45scardgame.com' rel='nofollow'>www.the45scardgame.com</a> <br/><br/>Rules (Merrimack Valley Style)<br/><br/>Objective: Partners try to win tricks and prevent their opponents from doing so. The first team to reach 120 points wins the game.<br/><br/>Scoring: Each trick counts for 5 points, and the highest trump in play is an additional 5. After the hand, each team counts what they have taken. If the bidder's team has taken at least the amount of their bid, they score all they have won. If this team fails, the amount of their bid is deducted from their score. The other team in either case always scores what it has won in tricks.<br/><br/>Winning the Game: The team to first reach a total of 120 points wins the game. If both teams reach 120 in the same hand, the bidding team wins the game.<br/><br/>Players: This game can be played with anywhere from 2 to 10 players, but in this version it's 2 vs. 2 (partners).<br/><br/>Cards: A regular deck of 52. The highest trump is the 5, then the Jack, then and Ace of Hearts (no matter what suit is trump). After that it goes Ace of suit, King, Queen, and then it black it goes 2 through 10 and in red 10 through 2 (both<br/>cases skipping the 5).<br/><br/>The Full rank in the trump suit is the following; <br/>From highest to lowest:<br/><br/>Hearts:<br/>5, J, A, K, Q, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 3, 2<br/><br/>Diamonds:<br/>5, J, Ace of Hearts, A, K, Q, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 3, 2<br/><br/>Clubs:<br/>5, J, Ace of Hearts, A, K, Q, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10<br/><br/>Spades:<br/>5, J, Ace of Hearts, A, K, Q, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10<br/><br/>The Full rank in off suit is as follows: (the Ace of Hearts is not shown since it is always a trump and always the third highest card);<br/><br/>From highest to lowest:<br/><br/>Hearts:<br/>K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2<br/><br/>Diamonds:<br/>K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A<br/><br/>Clubs:<br/>K, Q, J, A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10<br/><br/>Spades:<br/>K, Q, J, A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10<br/> Dealing: Each player is dealt 5 cards in batches of 3 then 2. After the initial 3 cards to each player, 3 are dealt to a kitty followed by 2 more to each player.<br/><br/>Bidding: The bidding starts with the player to the left of the deal and continues clockwise. Each player in turn may either <br/>bid or pass. Bids are made in multiples of 5 up to 30, with the minimum opening bid being 15. No suit is mentioned during <br/>the bidding process until all bids have been made. The highest bidder names the trump suit.<br/><br/>Drawing: Each player discards as many cards (up to 4) as he wishes from his hand. The dealer then restores each player's<br/>hand to 5 cards, starting with the player to his left. Cards are dealt all at once to each player (no 3-2 method).<br/><br/>Playing: The bidder makes the opening lead. The hand is played out in 5 tricks. If a trump is lead and you have any trump <br/>cards, you must follow suit.* If an off-suit card is led, any card may be played. A trick is won by the highest trump or the highest card of the suit led if no trump are played.<br/><br/><br/>    Reneging exception: The three highest trumps (5, J, Ace of Hearts) have the privilege of reneging when a lower trump is led. For example, if the trump 6 is led, a player holding any of these three top trumps without lower trumps may throw off-suit instead of following suit (if he has lower trump also, then he must play a trump). But there is no reneging a higher trump. For example, if the trump Jack is played, the holder of the 5 may renege, but not the holder of the Ace of Hearts.<br/><br/><br/>"}, "71744": {"rpgitemversion": {"47237": "PDF version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "The Big Five", "rpgproducer": {"14824": "Mike Mason"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic844198.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "average": "8.5", "rpggenre": {"940": "Action / Adventure"}, "rpg": {"1454": "Wordplay"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic844198_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>A full Narrative roleplaying game by Graham Spearing with four mini-settings known as themes.<br/><br/>eatures of the game<br/><br/>* A simple and flexible D6 dice pool mechanic<br/>    * Four settings  designed to contain all the information the players and referee need to start playing straight away<br/>    * A fantasy bestiary<br/><br/>The Big Five are:<br/><br/>1.

This late-era game was also the last in the series released on Nintendo's 8-bit console. Due to the declining support of the NES and the growing presence of the newer and more powerful Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), Capcom decided not to publish Mega Man 6 in North America. The North American version of Mega Man 6 was released by Nintendo of America instead. Critical reviews favored the game's comparable presentation and use of the established gameplay model from preceding chapters in the series, though nearly all judged it a redundant sequel.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Mega_Man_6,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "71757": {"statistics": {}, "name": "SoulCalibur IV", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"37934": "English/UK XBox 360 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic726744.jpg", "videogameseries": {"4784": "SoulCalibur"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "videogamefranchise": {"6404": "Greatest Hits (Best Selling PlayStation Games, US)"}, "usersrated": "129", "average": "7.04155", "videogamegenre": {"2159": "Fighting"}, "videogameplatform": {"4435": "PlayStation 3"}, "videogamehonor": {"31849": "2008 Game Critics Best Fighting Game of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic726744_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Soulcalibur IV is the sixth installment in Namco's Soul series of fighting games, and was released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on July 29, 2008.<br/><br/>The fifth installment in the Soulcalibur series features the Story, Arcade, Training and Museum modes.

Featuring the titular fictional character Shadow the Hedgehog from Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series, the game was revealed at the March 2005 Walk of Game inauguration of Sonic, the series' main character. Shadow the Hedgehog is the third game (and the last in the Sonic series) developed by Sega Studio USA, which was merged back into Sega's Japanese division in early 2008.<br/><br/>Following the trend of recent Sonic games such as Sonic Adventure and Sonic Heroes, Shadow the Hedgehog is a 3D platform game.

The missions completed determine the game's plot, a feature referenced by the game's tagline, &quot;Hero or villain?

Approximately 30 different venues, rated for speed (fast, slow, medium), are included, as are options for a campaign game.<br/><br/>This is strictly a sports replay simulation game, with no strategy options other than runner and course selection.  Game is published by Owzat Games under license from Lambourne Games.<br/><br/>Another description:<br/><br/>At first glance the 100 Metres track event may seem an odd choice for a sports replay game. Around 10 seconds of explosive action, nothing in the way of in-race tactics (if you discount the physiological warfare that takes place as the runners line up and get to their marks, more akin to two boxers eyeballing each other before a fight than to an athletics meeting), no 'decisions' for the replay gamer to make, just pure unleashed speed from starting blocks to tape. But an athletics sprinting coach will tell you differently.<br/><br/>Each part of the race, and the training manuals usually divide the 100 Metres into four distinct sections, Start, Pick-Up, Acceleration and Maximum Speed, require varying disciplines and techniques, and world-class sprinters all have their strengths and weaknesses, so this is what we have tried to focus on in this simulation, hopefully bringing to life the running characters of some of the All-Time-Great sprinters of the last hundred years. We have extended the training manual concept of four different sections into six, taking the runners progressively to 10m, 30m, 50m, 70m, 90m and 100m and within those six Sections each athlete's ability will vary to re-create his running style. And ability too, we hope. And here we must insert a caveat. In athletics to a degree not applicable to other timed sports performances have improved dramatically as training methods, diets and track surfaces have evolved and here we are trying to compare Charles Paddock with Maurice Green, Jesse Owens with Donovan Bailey.<br/><br/>To make this simulation 'work' we have had to use a benchmark, time wise, and up-grade the performances of athletes from earlier era to this level of performance. Because we felt that users would want to be able to get close to the current World Record (in the right circumstances with the right athletes) we have geared the simulation to 2001 season performances, assuming in doing so that the great sprinters of the past would have travelled that much quicker with all the (legal) advantages that their contemporary 'rivals' enjoy today. At the end of the day, of course, it is our judgement in all such matters, you may well disagree with that, and we can only say in our defence that we have been as objective as possible after lengthy and detailed research.<br/><br/>"}, "71850": {"rpgitemversion": {"299861": "PDF version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Rise of Magic", "rpgproducer": {"16482": "Julius Rosenstein"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2873702.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"11382": "Rifts Earth"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"940": "Action / Adventure"}, "rpg": {"2180": "Rifts Chaos Earth"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2873702_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the sourcebook:<br/><br/>Nothing is what it seems in the ever changing setting of Rifts Chaos Earth.

It was released in North America on April 30, 2000 for the Nintendo 64 video game console. It is the series' first 3D game. Excitebike 64 is the sequel to the acclaimed Nintendo Entertainment System game Excitebike and is the second title in the series. It was later succeeded by the Wii game Excite Truck.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>You can choose from one of six riders, each with his own pre-set handling attributes. To control the bike, use the analog or D-pad moving the bike A to accelerate, B to brake, R for slide, and Z for a turbo boost. Just as in the original, holding down gives you more air on jumps, while holding up aims your front wheel forward to enable landing on slopes. The game isn't meant to be an accurate motorbiking simulation. It chooses to follow the original in giving &quot;extreme&quot; jumps and physics, creating a far more &quot;exciting&quot; atmosphere.<br/><br/>Features<br/><br/>The main game features a 20-track season mode. Completing races unlocks more tracks and features. Also included is a tutorial that will teach you how to play through 17 different tracks. Also included are a variety of exhibitions and time trial modes that let you do more activities other than the main game. A major feature is the track editor, where you can create your own fully-functional track and save it into the game. The announcer, Limua, shouts out the tricks and crashes throughout the race.

The game's core design is that of a time trial arcade racer, that is, each race sees players attempting to get to the finish line in the shortest period of time possible. The player's bike has two options, an accelerator and a turbo function, the latter increases the player's engine temperature and overheating will cause the player's bike to stall. As in ExciteBots and ExciteTruck, the game features ranks S, A, B, C, and D which are determined by how well the player performs in races. Only gaining a rating of B or higher will allow the player to progress.<br/><br/>Races take place throughout different fictional tracks around the world, and include locales from London, America, Japan and Mexico.<br/><br/>Excitebike: World Rally includes an online component, allowing players to play anonymously over the internet, or with friends in a similar fashion to Mario Kart Wii.

Fight melees between British regiments of Foot, coal-fired robots, fez-wearing villains, snarling, leaping mummies, knife-twirling Chinese henchman, hordes of spear-chucking Zulus, ferocious African wildlife, ravenous dinosaurs, mad scientists, vampire lords, and rifle-wielding Sikhs; or any bizarre combination that tickles your fancy.<br/><br/>DHW is set in a romantic fictional universe, half a world away and over a century ago. Most battles and skirmishes take place in the hot, mountainous country of Quarajanistan. Though bloodthirsty action has also been spied on the dinosaur-infested Namajaro Plateau, in the steaming jungles and Lost Valley of the Baka-Mang, and the deadly, secret Kingdom of the Kuji-Gani.<br/><br/>The game is based loosely on the well-known wars of British Colonialism: Northern India, the Zulu War, the Boer War, the Egyptian and Sudanese campaigns, but also includes many fantastical elements. In the world of DHW, it is not uncommon to spy an armoured airship, coal-fired borrowing contraption, Martian Tripod, steam-powered tank, or even lancers on unicycles!  During the course of play, expect to encounter heinous villains, malodorous creatures, and indecent foreigners - the likes of which can only be foiled by true-blooded Englishmen, usually followed by a stiff brandy and cigars.<br/><br/>Inspired by books and films such as The Lost World, War of the Worlds, The Mummy, Zulu, Zulu Dawn, Master of the World, At the Earth&rsquo;s Core, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, Valley of the Gwangi, and many others, DHW is a light wargame.<br/><br/>So, deterministic combat, and other such popular systems, that take away from the drama of game playing &ndash; are not part of the game before you. Also, there is a trend that as you learn more facts about a historical period, you instinctively add more detail to the game rules; the result being more detailed, complex rules systems that take longer and longer to finish on the game table. DHW is not that type of system. DHW has put to the sword: quality checks, leadership tests, and endless weaponry charts and the like. Speed of play and ease of use is at the heart of the game.<br/><br/>To enable you to concentrate on maneuvering your forces, DHW has streamlined other clunky generalship mechanisms, into an elegant and simple system: you roll movement dice for distance. By one simple roll of some dice, leadership, discipline, training, unit morale and terrain irregularities have all been addressed. This means troops move a varying distance at a time, depending upon dice rolls, rather than moving a predictable fixed distance each turn. This represents the fickle nature of warfare, as well as a large element of surprise caused by the inability of commanders, to understand what is happening beyond their immediate position on the ground.<br/><br/>With combat, DHW ups the suspense and the drama by settling any close-combat scuffles by pitting figure against figure, and opposing players roll unique icon dice to determine casualties. This contrived game mechanism is engineered to accomplish one thing - excitement. Individual combat resolution is the closest players will ever come to actually crossing sabres. Ranged fire is resolved using the very same dice - various outcomes are possible depending on which icons are rolled.<br/><br/>An often-cited shortfall of wargaming design, is that the player who rolls better dice than their opponent will always win. This is generally true, and some would say this reflects the chaos of battle and the vagaries of command. Damned Hot Work addresses this issue with Feather Tokens, gifted to each player whenever they fail certain die rolls. These tokens can be spent in multiples of four on later turns to buy instant-kills, or succeed morale checks, or move a unit more aggressively.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"38666": "God Save the Queen Edition"}, "average": "0", "name": "Damned Hot Work: The Steampunk Miniatures Game", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2018": "Campaign / Battle Card Driven"}, "age": "6", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"5610": "Steampunk"}}, "71885": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic736766.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"37705": {"name": "Chandler Tedholm"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1981", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamepublisher": {"12506": {"name": "National Monstergaming Society"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic736766_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "(BGG description:)<br/><br/>Chandler Tedholm's Tactical Surface Combat rules replace the original War in the Pacific Surface-Surface Combat Display with what amounts to a complete tactical naval game system, explained in a mere six small-format pages of rules, and taking not much more time than the original combat system.<br/><br/>Instead of the abstract &quot;move by numbers&quot; system of WITP, the players move the actual task forces on a hexagonal hexmap corresponding to one hex on the WITP map (with simple rules on how represent terrain appearing on the WITP map), 30 hexes across.

Metroid was produced by Gunpei Yokoi and directed by Yoshio Sakamoto, with music composed by Hirokazu Tanaka. Set on the planet Zebes, the story follows Samus Aran as she attempts to retrieve Metroid creatures that were stolen by Space Pirates, who plan to replicate the Metroids by exposing them to beta rays and then use them as biological weapons to destroy Samus and all who oppose them.<br/><br/>The game's style, focusing on exploration and searching for power-ups used to reach previously inaccessible areas, influenced other video games, and the varied endings for fast completion times made it a popular game for speedrunning.

The photos, also used in advertising campaigns, featured bikini-clad Maria Whittaker, a model who was then associated with The Sun tabloid's Page Three topless photo shoots. Palace Software's marketing strategy provoked outrage in the United Kingdom; protestors focused on sexual aspects of the packaging rather than decapitations and other violence within the game. The ensuing controversy boosted Barbarian's profile, helping to make it a commercial success. Game critics were impressed with its fast and furious combat, and dashes of humour.

The explosion sends the city into chaos while Cole finds himself with new electricity-based super powers. Though the game's story follows Cole using his new abilities to restore some semblance of order to Empire City, the player is given several opportunities to use these powers for good or evil purposes in the game's Karma system.

It was initially released as an arcade game for the Neo Geo platform. It was later ported to several systems, including Dreamcast and the PlayStation 2. It is also currently available on the subscription service GameTap. The gameplay, which can be characterized as a combination of a fixed shooter and a versus puzzle game, uses combinations of shots, as well as timed powerups to attempt to damage the opponent. These attacks also serve as counters to the opponent's attack.<br/><br/>There are two types of standard attacks: a normal shot and a charge-up shot. Each character starts with two bombs which enables him in the event of desperate plight, to clean with the screen while briefly acquiring a state of invincibility. The two players' playfields are separated by a vertical bar, each one having its own independent of the other. Series of enemies arrive from the top of the screen. The player is to successfully destroy them in chains (combos), which will send one or more fireball projectiles to the screen of his adversary (Normal Attack). Shooting at Normal Attacks several times reflects them back as glowing Reverse Attacks. If Reverse Attacks are reflected again, a number of powerful counterattacks in the shape of one or more indestructible enemies appear (Extra Attack). Reflecting many Reverse Attacks at once can instead summon a boss (Boss Attack).&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Twinkle_Star_Sprites,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "71963": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Greenline", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"11505": "Promotional Board Games"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic730419_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"12565": {"name": "Philips"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic730419.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"39007": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Greenline is a roll and move game that represents the moving of the resources of a large corporation around the world. Players compete to get to the end of the board first...<br/><br/>However, unlike a simple roll and move game, there are some interesting wrinkles. Each player uses a different mode of transport: airplane, train, truck, or boat. Each mode allows a player to avoid a hazard or gain an advantage in a particular situation that may or may not come up during any particular session. At the beginning of the game, the player who rolls highest gets to choose their mode of transport, followed by the next highest rolling player, etc. Each mode uses a different color pawn.<br/><br/>Also, players have the option of rolling for one of 5 special attributes at the beginning of the game. These attributes - 1. invoice, 2. letter of credit, 3. customs documents, 4. freight insurance, &amp; 5. the goods... are not exclusive to any one player and are randomly determined. A player may roll as many times as they like for these attributes (which can potentially prevent setbacks or lend an advantage), but once they've started moving on the board, they are not allowed to roll for any more attributes. Players must balance a desire for having as many attributes as possible with the notion of getting moving on the board.<br/><br/>The main path on the board (also the shortest path) is the Greenline of the title. However, if players land on certain squares they must roll a die to see if they are diverted onto a red circuit. This creates a delay as the player must go through a side path that usually has other negative encounter possibilities. There are also a number of yellow spaces on the board that represent random challenges which require the player to have one of the special attributes to avoid a penalty or to gain an advantage.<br/><br/>This game appears to have been developed by Philips to build teamwork or to encourage employees to think in terms of working as efficiently as possible.

This model also included a detachable Hard Disk Drive (initially 20 GB, while later models had 60 GB) to store downloaded content, provide compatibility with original Xbox games, and store game data. The included hard drive came with game demos, video clips and a free Live Arcade game, Hexic HD. In July 2007, this version of the Xbox 360 began appearing with the Zephyr motherboard (the motherboard used in the Elite) which features HDMI 1.2 output and an improved GPU heatsink. Although this package did include an HDMI output, it did not come with an HDMI cable. Starting at the end of September 2007, the newest systems were shipped with the new &quot;Falcon&quot; motherboard. This motherboard includes the new 65-nm CPUs, making them quieter and cooler than the older systems. On August 1, 2008, the 20 GB version was discontinued and was replaced by a 60 GB HDD model at the same price.

The first level consists of five houses each with a bin to be emptied, the second level has six houses, and so on. Once all the bins are emptied, the player simply walks to the top of the street to complete the level.<br/><br/>Each level has a time limit, if the player fails to empty all the bins within this limit then the player has to repeat the level. If a level is played three times exceeding the time limit, the game is over. The player must avoid stepping onto grass, as doing so will cause the time counter to decrease very rapidly until they step off it. But if the player manages to empty a bin without stepping onto any grass, the householder appears at the door and invites the player in for a few seconds. This will increase the time limit, as well as providing a little humorous conversation, such as &quot;Could you look at my TV?&quot; - &quot;I meant mend it, not watch it&quot;.<br/><br/>The biggest threat to the player is the passing traffic in the road, if the player is run over by a car the game ends immediately. Sometimes if the player steps onto the grass, a dog comes out of the house and tries to bite the player, making them limp for a minute or two.

Dungeon Master was a realtime game instead of the traditional turn-based approach that was prevalent until then. Instead of using text-based commands to interact with the environment, players directly manipulated objects and the environment by clicking the mouse in the enlarged first-person view. Abstract Dungeons and Dragons style experience points and levels were eschewed in favor of a system where the characters' skills were improved directly via using them. It also introduced some novel control methods including the spell casting system, which involved learning sequences of runes which represented the form and function of a spell's effect. For example, a fireball spell was created by mixing the fire symbol with the wing symbol. This kind of attention to detail and focus on the user interface was typical of the game and helped create an often captivating sense of craft and ingenuity. Other factors in immersiveness were the then-revolutionary use of sound effects to indicate when a creature was nearby, and (primitive) dynamic lighting.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "71551": {"videogame": {"95785": "10 Computer Hits 1"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Skool Daze", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"37285": "Commodore 64 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic733654.jpg", "videogameseries": {"6842": "Skool"}, "videogametheme": {"2472": "School"}, "usersrated": "9", "average": "7.33333", "videogamegenre": {"2161": "Action Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4420": "Commodore 64"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"95785": "10 Computer Hits 1"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic733654_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Skool Daze is a computer game created by David Reidy (whose wife Helen was a school teacher at the time) for the ZX Spectrum and released by Microsphere in 1985.

The WaveBird requires a receiver to be plugged into the controller port of the GameCube. Made of the same colored plastic, this dongle features a channel-selection wheel and an LED to indicate when a signal is received.<br/><br/>In terms of design, the WaveBird controller is built mostly in the same way as the standard GameCube controller (minus the rumble feature); the components (analog sticks, buttons, and triggers) and layout remain the same, while adding the wireless functionality and an internal battery pack. The WaveBird controller is somewhat larger and heavier than a standard GameCube controller, with the &quot;center hole&quot; between the D-pad and the C-stick replaced by the RF mechanism internally and an on/off switch and orange LED power indicator on the face of the controller. In terms of capabilities, the only feature the WaveBird controller lacks when compared to the standard controller is the rumble feature, the motors of which would reduce battery life. Due to the data being transmitted, relayed, then decoded, there is a very slight delay in button response compared to a wired controller, but not enough to be noticeable or affect gameplay.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;WaveBird&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "71587": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Super Game Boy", "usersrated": "25", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1061096.jpg", "videogamehwversion": {"193235": "American SNES Super Game Boy"}, "videogamehardwarecategory": {"2326": "Add-On"}, "average": "7.332", "videogamehardware": {"4422": "Game Boy"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1061096_t.jpg", "videogamehwmfg": {"1326": "Nintendo Co., Ltd."}, "description": "The Super Game Boy is an adapter cartridge for Nintendo's Super Nintendo Entertainment System, as well as the Super Famicom in Japan.

As the CEO of one of these mega-corporations, in Charon, Inc. you will vie against CEOs of other corporations as you exploit the planet&rsquo;s resources and colonize Charon, the largest moon of the dwarf planet Pluto.<br/><br/>You will stake claims to the various mining regions of Charon, acquire resources for building facilities, use special actions (fair and unfair) to gain advantages over other CEOs, and build your empire to achieve victory in this fast-paced game of planetary domination!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>The board shows Charon divided into several regions. Each round, seed the regions with a mix of gems. Players start with a hand of building cards: at the start of each round, everyone puts one into a common pool. At the end of each round, you get additional cards.Players' bidding flags start out 1 in each of the special power areas. Go around bidding till each player has just one flag unspent. Bid by moving a flag from its space to a location on the board -- in a region, on a border btwn 2 regions, or on an intersection (corner) touching 2-4 regions. After all bids placed, use the special power where your last flag stands -- that is a pretty cool twist, where you have to decide which special power you want to try for (but you only get it if you're alone on that power; or if there's 2 of you in a 5er game!). Then resolve each region: the player with the most flags in/around it wins all the gems. Ties broken by seniority, where a flag is more &quot;senior&quot; if it affects fewer regions (center then edge then corner).<br/><br/>After all gems collected, players (in turn order) use their gems to build cards from common pool and/or their hand (but may never build cards with same number). May trade gems (3:1?) to get the colors you need, and may only save a limited number of gems from turn to turn. Some special powers change trade ratio and holding limit.<br/><br/>After 5 rounds, player who built the highest sum of buildings wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"232731": "Chinese edition"}, "average": "6.36175", "name": "Charon Inc.", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "13", "usersrated": "468", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}}, "71594": {"boardgamedesigner": {"67818": {"name": "David Ng"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Phylo", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2070": "Simulation"}, "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "5", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic731347_t.jpg", "average": "6.1", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic731347.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"205357": "English Beaty Biodiversity Museum Deck"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "In Phylo you build a biodiverse habitat using real species found in nature.

SimCity 4: Deluxe Edition contained the original game and Rush Hour combined as a single product.<br/><br/>The game allows players to create a region of land by terraforming, and then to design and build a settlement which can grow into a city. Players can zone different areas of land as commercial, industrial, or residential development, as well as build and maintain public services, transport and utilities. For the success of a city players must manage its finances, environment, and quality of life for its residents. SimCity 4 introduces night and day cycles and other special effects for the first time in the SimCity series. External tools such as the Building Architect Tool (BAT) allow custom third party buildings and content to be added to the gameplay.<br/><br/>SimCity 4 was praised for being the second game in the SimCity series to primarily use a 3D engine to render its graphics, the first being SimCity 64 for the ill-fated Nintendo 64DD. It received widespread acclaim, won several awards, and was one of the top ten selling PC games of 2003.[3] It was however criticised for the difficulty of gameplay and computer performance.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;SimCity_4,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "71610": {"rpgitemversion": {"74855": "First Printing"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Mythes et Animaux Fabuleux", "rpgproducer": {"14417": "Aleksi Briclot"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic854705.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "average": "7", "rpggenre": {"940": "Action / Adventure"}, "rpg": {"1352": "Qin: Les Royaumes Combattants"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic854705_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>Qin, exotic and fantastic!

After losing his father to Andross, Fox assembles a new Star Fox team, consisting of former member Peppy Hare, Slippy Toad, Falco Lambardi, and himself. When Andross once again threatens the universe, Star Fox travels across several planets, helping General Pepper and the Cornerian Army fight off the Evil Andross and his forces.<br/><br/>The game play is level based, each level representing one planet or small sector in the galaxy (Such as Corneria or an Asteroid Field.). At the end of every level is a boss, and defeating the boss will take players to the next planet in the galaxy towards Andross's homeworld. However, by meeting certain conditions and requirements in particular levels, players can take alternate routes, leading to different planets, or an alternate ending. As the players traverse each level they destroy enemy ships, collect power-ups, and help their team members survive their own dog fights. If a team member's health reaches zero they retreat back to the Great Fox, the teams traveling Home Base, for the remainder of the current level and all of the next while they make repairs.<br/><br/>Star Fox 64 is a complete re-envisioning of the original Star Fox (On the Super Nintendo Entertainment System).

The game pioneered the use of in-game graphics drawn to resemble classic hand-drawn cartoon animation.<br/><br/>Many of the challenges that Willy faces are typical choices that a nine-year-old boy must make: whether to push his little sister on the swingset (and how high to push her), whether to wash his dad's car, and whether to take his dog for a walk. Making unwise choices can produce negative consequences of various sorts. For instance, if Willy does not wash his father's car, he does not receive his allowance, and cannot buy an item that he will need later in the game.

Development of a Japanese version was started, but was never released.<br/><br/>Metropolis Street Racer is notable for introducing the &quot;Kudos&quot; system (whereby players are rewarded for racing stylishly as well as quickly) into video games, and for its detailed and accurate recreations of the cities of London, Tokyo and San Francisco. Music for the game was composed by Richard Jacques, and delivered via nine fictional radio stations (three for each city), similar to the Grand Theft Auto series.
