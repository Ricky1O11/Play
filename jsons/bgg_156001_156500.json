The game play was inspired by classic side-scrolling video games like Double Dragon and Contra.<br/><br/>Each hero and villain has a main game card that lists their 1)strength, 2)speed and 3)intelligence points. Each hero must add to their strength, speed and intelligence points by collecting cards based on weapons, health, powers and superpowers. Cards are collected by moving along playing spaces in each level. Game cards accumulated not only provide point levels for strength, speed and intelligence, but they also give specific instructions on their limitations and extra abilities. Some cards can be kept and others are one-time use.<br/><br/>Players compete to gain as many points as possible before taking on each level's villainous boss. Each boss has a complete deck of cards to fuel their strength, speed and intelligence points.

It should come as no surprise, then, that wizards, witches, and other powerful spellcasters are always on the lookout for new and exciting spells to add to their repertoires. While many spells from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook received a facelift and an upgrade in Mythic Adventures, the sourcebook that introduced mythic power to the game of Pathfinder, dozens of spells were left behind. Missing Mythic Magic Volume I, and its successors, aim to give each and every spell from the core rules a full-fledged mythic upgrade, all the way from A to Z, with a special focus on making mythic spells that feel as over-the-top and larger-than-life as possible.<br/><br/>This installment includes 16 mythic spells, from bestow curse to charm animal. With the spells in this book you can inflict powerful and exotic curses, including rendering your victim incapable of speech or turning the entire world against him, and rest easy knowing that these curses are incredibly hard to remove. Or, put your foes through an array of unfortunate options with an extensively enhanced version of binding. Even lowly spells like bleed and bless water are made exciting through mythic power, with the former interfering with the target&rsquo;s ability to stabilize (even mythic characters, who normally do so automatically), and the latter granting the option to transform entire bodies of liquid (albeit relatively small ones) into fonts of holy water.<br/><br/>Don&rsquo;t wait: get your hands on the latest mythic spells now.<br/><br/>"}, "156106": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2236527.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Travis R.

The life of a dark elf can be full of pleasure and desire. It can also be short, brutal and end at the blade of a priestess.<br/><br/>Her power stretches forth like a malignant shadow, leeching into the lives of dark elf and non-dark elf alike. It is her goal to make her people the strongest race imaginable, cutting the wheat from the chaff with complex plots and sub-plots as the countless ages roll on.<br/><br/>For the first time, the secrets of this cult are laid bare and the day-to-day life of her cult members exposed, along with a wealth of new information.

Many regard him as one of the most influential scientists in history. His seminal work, the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, which is Latin for &quot;Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy&quot;, laid the foundation for classical mechanics.<br/><br/>In Newton's Noggin, 2-4 players manipulate ideas inside Newton's head to formulate the concepts necessary to write the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica. Problems will need to be solved or worked around. Other players' ideas will impede your progress. The player that contributes the most ideas to Newton's masterwork wins the game.<br/><br/>Players begin the game with 30 ideas represented by wooden cubes in the player's color and six basic Think Cards.

The central hex is referred to as the Point, and may not be played upon by either participant.  There is a unique neutral piece called the &ldquo;Roy&rdquo; which is used to mark the Point.  Each player has thirteen pieces in their own color, as follows: five Flag pieces, four Maces, three Lances, and one Bar.  Only one piece may be on a hex at a time; landing on an occupied hex is a capture, and the opponent's piece is removed from the game.  The object of the game is to continually &ldquo;cover&rdquo; the Point by always having at least one piece ready to move onto it.  Should a player lose his pieces covering the Point and not be able to move another piece into covering position on the next turn, he loses the game.<br/><br/>The game begins with the players at opposite ends of the board, with a five hexagon side closest to them.  Their five Flags are placed on those closest five hexes, the player's back line.  Flags only move forward to one adjacent hex, toward the opponent's end of the board.  Should a Flag reach the center hex of the opponent's back line, on the next turn (if it has not since been captured) it can be exchanged for that player's Bar piece, which is held in reserve at the start of the game.  The Bar can be placed anywhere on the board, but will remain there for the rest of the game, unable to be moved or captured by either player.  No further moves are allowed for that turn.<br/><br/>Maces begin the game two to a side on both ends of the players' Flags, extending around the rim of the board.  Maces may move to any adjacent hex, in any direction.<br/><br/>Lances begin in the central three hexes of the third row of hexes inward from the players' back lines.

Because its core audience is children, the game features many kid (and parent!) friendly features including no ads or in-app purchases, separate in-game sound &amp; music volume controls, and a detailed, interactive tutorial.  Even though the game is targeted at kids, adults can also enjoy the compelling gameplay as well.<br/><br/>In the &quot;Patterns&quot; game, fish swim onto the screen in a random pattern and &quot;show their moves&quot;.  The player must tap the fish in the same order that they blinked.  Every level, one additional fish shows their moves, so the game gets progressively more difficult.  However, &quot;Patterns&quot; mode has a repeat option so you can view the pattern multiple times if necessary, and the player has unlimited time to copy the pattern.  The game ends when the player makes a mistake in copying the pattern and their &quot;score&quot; is the level they reached.  There is no limit to the number of levels except the limits of the player's memory.<br/><br/>The &quot;Timed Patterns&quot; game is very similar to &quot;Patterns&quot; except there is a limited amount of time per level, and there are no repeats.  It's much harder!<br/><br/>In &quot;Cards&quot;, the fish swim onto the screen and immediately hide behind cards.  Each player move consists of selecting three cards.  If the fish behind the three cards are the same, they are cleared from the board.  The game ends when the board is cleared, and the &quot;score&quot; is the number of moves it took for the player to clear the board.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/><br/>    Limitless memory gameplay (in 2 of the 3 game modes)<br/>    Delightful 2D cartoon graphics &amp; animation<br/>    Simple, intuitive gameplay and interface<br/>    Random presentation of patterns and characters at each level increases replayability<br/>    The game keeps track of your best score in each game mode separately in permanent storage<br/>    No ads or in-app purchases<br/>    Interactive tutorial explains all three games in detail<br/>    Color blind friendly &ndash; all UI elements have distinguishing features besides color<br/>    Upbeat and fun original soundtrack<br/><br/><br/>In summary, Sync and Swim provides a fresh (albeit salt-water) new take on the classic memory genre with a boatload of replayability.

They must build up a Temple, gather Faithful followers and collect powerful Relics in an attempt to wipe their opponents off the map &ndash; only one deity can reign eternal in this free-for-all of legendary proportions!<br/><br/>Play Time: <br/>2 players (1-hour), 3 players (1.5 hours), 4 players (2-2.5 hours)<br/><br/>Basic Play: <br/><br/>    Play follows a 4-step turn: Reveal (start), Marketplace (buy), Raid (combat), Reinforce (end). <br/>    The Tile Deck, Faithful Deck and Relic Deck feed into a central board called the Marketplace. <br/>    Players use Faithful (human followers) in their Temple to collect gold and defend in combat. <br/>    Faithful placed in the Raiding Party can attack opposing Temples during combat. <br/>    Relics (4 of which are aligned to each Fate) further increase strategic play and add variety. <br/>    Players will purchase Tiles from a randomized stack (the Tile Deck) to customize their Temple, which is then arranged strategically to increase hand-size and defenses. <br/>    The four fates are: Chaos, Grace, Prosperity and Wisdom, each tailored to a unique play-style. <br/>    Each Fate Deck has a powerful set of 20 different cards, in theme with each of the Fates. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Combat: <br/>A Raiding Party ventures into an opposing Temple, encountering Defenders and Traps along a Tile path  to the Heart of the Temple, where the opposing life force dwells. Combat is resolved through dice rolls, with Defense rolling first and combining its total. Faithful played from the Raiding Party must beat defending total or they are forced to retreat. If the Temple is conquered, damage is dealt through Smiting. When an opponent&rsquo;s life hits zero (20 max), they are defeated.

Command your armies of mystical Creatures and use the ultimate power force &ndash; the Uhrkraft &ndash; to win this battle for dominance!<br/><br/>The gameplay occurs strictly on the battlegrounds, in an intuitive set up, placing one player on the left side, against the other one, on the right. You then trade turns with your opponent in placing, moving and attacking Creatures on the board. Each such action consumes Uhrkraft, of which players receive ten points at the beginning of each turn. Tactical placement of armies on the board can increase your Uhrkraft Repository. Strategically use your Creatures and Runes to take away the opposing Warlord&rsquo;s life force by destroying his army and Strongholds. There are eight Creature types that can be spawned during a battle, at different Uhrkraft costs, all having different movement and attack patterns, hit points, damage ranges and special abilities. Mastering them is key to developing strategies and winning the battle. First player to take ten points off the opponent&rsquo;s life force wins the battle.<br/><br/>Challenge your friends either online or on the same device, or engage in conquering Uhr in the single player campaign mode, and experience the lyricism of this world all by yourself, against the AI. Either way, the whole environment is perfectly crafted to make the hours you&rsquo;ll likely spend playing UHR-Warlords, fly by. The world of Uhr is the result of Turbo Tape Games&rsquo; close collaboration with Demonaz, who throughout his career has worked on creating a world of fantasy and legend.

In the Daily Life section, players interact with other characters and progress through the plot. Conversing with characters during 'Free Time' sections earns Hope Shards, which can be exchanged for skills that can be used in the school trial. Players can also search for Monokuma Figures which earn Monokuma Medals that can exchanged for gifts to give other characters during Free Time segments. The Deadly Life section, which occurs when a crime scene is discovered, has the player search for evidence that will assist them in the Class Trial.<br/><br/>The Class Trial, in which players must determine the identity of a culprit, features the same aspects as the previous game, but with new gameplay elements. The Nonstop Debate, in which players look for contradictions in the students' discussion and shoot relevant weak points with &quot;Truth Bullets&quot; that contradict them, now includes blue-colored weak points which must be shot with evidence that indicates someone is speaking the truth. Hangman's Gambit now requires players to combine matching letters coming in from both sides of the screen before they collide into incorrect matches. Combined letters may then either be destroyed, or used to spell out the clue. Bullet Time Battle, now known as Panic Talk Action, is mostly unchanged from the previous game, in which players press buttons in time to the music to shoot down arguments, albeit players must now spell out a phrase in the correct order at the end. Finally, the Closing Argument, in which players fill out a comic strip depicting the events of a crime, is adjusted so that players fill out each page at a time using available stock, as opposed to having access to all the pages and pieces.<br/><br/>Various new gameplay elements have been added to the Class Trial. Rebuttal Showdowns take place when a student attempts to refute the player's logic. In these sections, players must slash apart their opponent's argument to gain dominance in the conversation and reveal new information, before using a &quot;Truth Sword&quot; to strike through the correct weak point when it appears. Logical Dive is a snowboarding minigame, in which players steer down a logical tube whilst avoiding pitfalls, occasionally requiring to choose between multiple routes based on a question given, in order to arrive at a logical conclusion. Finally, Spot Select requires players to examine an image and indicate an important spot.<br/><br/>There are also various modes outside the main game. Players have a virtual pet that can be accessed from the pause menu, which grows as players take steps in the game. Magical Girl Miracle\u2606Monomi is a minigame in which players control Monomi fighting off against waves of cute monsters. Island Mode, which is available after clearing the game once, is an alternate mode where the students don't go through the killing game and instead aim to make friends with everyone and earn Hope Shards. This allows players to bond with characters more easily than in the main story mode. Danganronpa IF, a short story depicting an alternate storyline for Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, is also unlocked after clearing the game once.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "156313": {"rpgartist": ["Jeffrey Carlisle", "Miguel Regod\u00f3n Harkness", "Tim Kings-Lynne", "Yong Yi Lee", "Kate Maximovich", "Miroslav Petrov", "Bryan Sola", "Vicky Yarova"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder Roleplaying Game"], "poll": [], "name": "Mummy's Mask Player's Guide", "rpgdesigner": ["Adam Daigle", "Rob McCreary"], "rpgproducer": ["Judy Bauer", "Logan Bonner", "Jason Bulmahn", "Christopher Carey", "John Compton", "Emily Crowell", "Adam Daigle", "James Jacobs", "Justin Juan", "Ryan Macklin", "Rob McCreary", "Mark Moreland", "Sonja Morris", "Ben Mouch", "Stephen Radney-MacFarland", "Patrick Renie", "Sean K.

In both cases, you will have to deal with the slithering Nightmares, which haunt the hallways of the labyrinth.<br/><br/>Onirim is a solo/cooperative card game. You (and a partner, if you wish) must work (together) against the game to gather the eight Door cards before the deck runs out; you can obtain those Door cards either by playing cards of the same color three turns in a row, or by discarding (under specific circumstances) one of your powerful Key cards. In both cases you will have to decide the best use of each card in your hand and carefully play around the Nightmares. Those cards are hidden in the deck and will trigger painful dilemmas when drawn...<br/><br/>Seven mini-expansions, all standalone and compatible with one another, are included with the second edition of Onirim, including these three that were in the first edition of the game:<br/><br/><br/>    &quot;The Towers&quot; introduces a new type of card that allows more searching and deck manipulation, while also imposing an additional victory condition.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    &quot;Happy Dreams and Dark Premonitions&quot; adds evil time bombs that will impede your progress at predictable moments of your quest as well as helpful but unreliable allies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    In &quot;The Book of Steps Lost and Found&quot;, you must find the eight Door cards in a randomly given order and may remove discarded cards from the game to cast powerful spells that will help you complete this difficult task.<br/><br/><br/>Apart from these three from the first edition, there are four new modules in the Onirim 2nd edition box. Just like previously, each module consists of something that makes the game easier and something that makes the game harder:<br/><br/><br/>    &quot;The Glyphs&quot; introduces a fourth symbol on location cards (apart from Key, Sun and Moon), which makes it easier to compose the row of unrepeated symbols.

The Limbo pile stays with Dreamcatcher until some effect allows the player to shuffle the pile back to the deck... if all Dreamcatchers are full and new cards should come to Limbo, a Dreamcatcher is discarded and his cards shuffled back. Also, four new &quot;Lost Dreams&quot; cards are supposed to be in Limbo at the end of the game, as an extra winning condition - so discarding all Dreamcatchers means loss.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    &quot;The Crossroads and Dead Ends&quot; introduce location cards with a given symbol (3 Sun, 2 Moon, 1 Key), but serving as any color &quot;joker&quot;.

Each side of the die represents a category: music, drink, literature, fashion, movies, and food. One player rolls the die and has one minute to declare a factoid concerning the rolled subject. If everyone accepts the factoid as true, then play passes to the left. If someone challenges the factoid, then that player has two minutes to disprove the statement using whatever electronic device is handy. The winner in the challenge scores one point. The winner of the game is declared when that person scores five points.

Inside, you'll find:<br/><br/>     Updates to the existing Pathfinder Roleplaying Game classes and races, bringing them into the 21st century.<br/>     6 brand new classes with 20 new archetypes. <br/>         Charmer: Masters of the social arts, charmers are masters of flattery and persuasion, using their innate appeal to deceive, manipulate, and bend others to their will.<br/>             Archetypes: Animal Whisperer, Gambler, Romancer, Undercover Spy<br/>        <br/>         Entertainer: Consummate performers, entertainers are happiest in front of an audience. They create and control the raw emotions of everyone around them. As they advance in levels they also gain status and influince.<br/>             Archetypes: Stand-up Comic, Pro Athlete, Stuntman<br/>        <br/>         Gadgeteer: Techies. Gearheads. Geeks.

They can also create concoctions that can have either beneficial or detrimental effects.<br/>             Archetypes: Engineer, Psychologist<br/>        <br/>         Stranger: Every culture produces individuals who ultimately live apart from it, strangers within their own lands. Whether driven away from society or choosing to live apart from their fellow man, strangers face scorn and derision wherever they go. Still, living outside the system lets them accomplish things that most 9-5ers can only dream about.<br/>             Archetypes: Drunken Bum, Parolee, Street Preacher, Traditional Tribal Warrior<br/>        <br/>    <br/>     New Skills<br/>     New Feats<br/>     New Spells<br/>     New Afflictions<br/>     200 Full Color Illustrations<br/>     Modern weapons, equipment, and vehicles.<br/>     2 campaign universes and sample adventures:<br/>         Fifth Realm: The nine worlds of Norse mythology are real... and on a collision course with Midgard, the fifth realm.

The man seems to know that they are freelancers or petty criminals with skills at deception, stealth, and theft. The note is in a sealed envelope with a wax seal.<br/><br/>If the Player Characters decide to tamper with the note they find a forged will, which leaves all the possessions of his parents to the middle-aged man. Their combined assets are worth about 250K, paltry compared to the 2.5K offered to the group for the task. They could decide to refuse the job or go back and renegotiate with their employer. If they seem to let on that they know the scheme, the middle age man ups the ante to 25K, figuring that they might just be competent enough to pull this off. Of course, if they decline he now has no choice but to off them and look for some new employees. A man who has decided to kill his own parents after all has no moral qualms about killing people he just met.<br/><br/>If the Player Characters accept the job, it is up to them to figure out how to get into the safe deposit room and make the exchange. They could break in to the bank of night. They could also steal the safe deposit key from the man&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; house, disguise themselves to look like the parents, and just walk into the safe deposit room to make the exchange. They could also attempt to distract the security officer(s) on duty and disable the recording devices in the monitoring room, and then switch documents. If they think to read the document they switched out, the will gives most of the money to the man&rsquo;s younger brother instead with a small amount to their employer.<br/><br/>With the deed done, the middle-aged man puts the hit on his parents.

Needless to say, the tavern goers were nervous. A crazy guy grabbing a chair and smashing another guy over the head was something they could understand and run from, but a drunken wizard who is likely able to turn anyone who makes any sudden movements into a newt for a few days? Why, that is something else entirely. Finally getting fed up with this pointless standoff, over a few silver on a tab, no less, an adventuring fighter stepped up to put an end to this.<br/><br/>After recovering from being a newt for nearly two weeks, the fighter decided that enough was enough. Something, anything, had to be done about these blasted spellcasters! Though his knowledge of magic was miniscule, he recalled that magic, particularly divination, had issues around lead. Thus laden with lead-based talcum powders from the local alchemist, the fighter went on to make almost impossible victories against obnoxious users of magic, that is until he died of lead poisoning a little over a year later.<br/><br/>Rallying around this man, now seen a martyr, a number of fighters and clerics of arcane-hating gods continued his crusade.

Countries autonomously  act with each other,influencing the market  and  political situation(some political events can create a job oportunity with bigger challenge  and at the same time with bigger profits and reputation points). As for missions-There are many types of them they are played on a smaller maps with terrain also in the turn based manner(One of the things that we want to make is a very tactical game play where diceroll isn't a decisive thing but human skill is). All in all the game has more  of  rouge like feel  than a  classical wargame with particular objectives.  The process is the main fun part,but global goals also here(Player can get a citizenship of particular country and lead it to world  domination,take hold of the entire PMC market and be the one who pull the strings,also there are  some endings that are closely lore related).Also battle system can be used just for skirmishes.<br/><br/>"}, "156415": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1992890.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Bill Clemons", "Michael Cox (II)", "Kevin Cox (II)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Bill Clemons"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Angry Ogre Games"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1992890_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Racing"], "description": "(#@*^, it's fun!)<br/><br/>The official game of OverMen everywhere; &quot;Bob&quot;ball! offers the perfect combination of awesome and balls in a revolutionary, mind-altering format.
