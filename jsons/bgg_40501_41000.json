The game dates to the 15th century and is based on earlier large board shogi games. Before the discovery of Taikyoku Shogi in 1997, Tai Shogi was believed to be the largest playable chess variant, if not board game, ever. One game may be played over several long sessions and require each player to make over a thousand moves. It was never a popular game; indeed, a single production of half a dozen game sets in the early 17th century was a notable event.<br/><br/>Like other large-board variants, but unlike standard Shogi, the game is played without drops, and uses a promotion-by-capture rule.<br/><br/>Tai Shogi is a gargantuan of a game both in terms of strategy and playing time. A serious game of Tai will require several long sessions to complete and may need over 1000 -moves per player. The game is simply too big to be played strategically, and therefore the game typically proceeds as a series of local skirmishes as both players try to develop their pieces and improve their position. Flat out rapid play will typically take at least three days (takes an hour or so to setup!).<br/><br/>While most of the 101 different pieces in Tai Shogi are also found in other variants, one unique feature of Tai is the presence right from the beginning of the game of the all powerful Emperors.<br/><br/>Tai Shogi is played on a board of 25 x 25 squares and each player has 177 pieces (including 25 pawns) ! A unique feature of Tai Shogi is the presence right from the start of the game of the all powerful Emperors. The Emperor has the greatest power of any piece in any of the Shogi variants as it may move in one turn to almost any square on the board, jumping over any number of pieces of either side in the process.<br/><br/>While you might think that the power of the Emperors would have a great impact on the course of the game, their powers tend to offset each other. It should be noted that any otherwise unprotected piece is always protected by its own Emperor.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["The Shogi Association George Hodges edition"], "name": "Tai Shogi", "playingtime": "2000", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement", "Point to Point Movement"], "average": "7", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Chess Games", "Combinatorial", "Shogi"]}, "40983": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Joris Dries"], "poll": [], "name": "Gefira", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Route/Network Building", "Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic446376_t.jpg", "average": "3.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Gamoti"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic446376.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Card Game"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>Lead your people to the other side!<br/><br/>Gefira...the only way out of the wretched jungle.

Possible commands are<br/><br/>1. Non-combat Movement<br/>2. Charge into Melee Combat<br/>3. Melee Combat<br/>4. Missile Combat<br/>5. Rally<br/>6. Disengage<br/>7. Sorcery<br/><br/>In addition to these commands, you may have to deal with the mandatory command Retreat.  Each player in turn issues all commands to his forces, resolves all effects, then play passes to the next player.<br/><br/>Warbands are built using a point based system, before play begins players choose their Kingdom, and may only marshal forces from that Kingdom.  Full rules, army lists, and point costs are downloadable for free at the company website.

Time after time, his panzers swept across the desert like hot sirocco winds in their unrelenting blitzkrieg fashion. The British were nearing their end, so it seemed. Whatever defenses they created did little to halt Rommel. The Germans were also nearing their end logistically speaking as El Alamein was far, far away from their main supply depots. Rommel's own panzers were wearing out from all of the fast advances that had totally kept the British off balance.<br/>The first of the grueling dogfight battles occurred from July 1-4. Hitler was pressing Rommel to go for the kill and reach the Nile. Rommel, himself, felt certain the British were at their end after the unraveling of their defenses in June and their chaotic retreat. But his DAK divisions had suffered and most were really just regimental size. Panzer divisions had a mere 30 tanks. Still, he went forth confident. In this battle, fuel was not an issue, but Rommel attacked without much intelligence as to where the enemy really was. For the British, it was their last stand. They could not afford another Gazala or Tobruk because it would mean Egypt was German.<br/>The second dogfight battle in the same area began August 30th. Rommel would once again try his sweep around the end tactic and block all retreat routes. The battle is also known as Alam Halfa. Rommel had replenished his panzer divisions this time but fuel was a keen issue, as his plan called for them to advance deep into the rear of the British and cut them off. The problem was that his panzers would then have little fuel. By now, Rommel was more hesitant in this offensive and secured guarantees from Hitler that more fuel would arrive. Hitler promised. Reluctant, the order was again given in what was his last attempt to reach the Nile. The British were well prepared this time around and more or less knew of the plan. Their minefields were widened, units were instructed to let the German's come to them, their bombers readied. Dogfight 2 ended on Sept. 3, and the British lost a precious chance to encircle the DAK.<br/><br/>There are two games distinct from one another. Each uses different rules, counters and maps. They are at different scales with dogfight 2 being more tactical and dogfight 1, operational.<br/>Each day turn in dogfight 1 is 8 hrs, 1 mile hexes.

One major difference in Second Edition was the addition of a cost system to equipment, events, personnel, and ships. A card's cost is listed in the top left-hand corner of a card, directly preceding the card's title as a single digit number (currently anywhere from 0 to 9). A player receives seven 'counters' at the beginning of each turn; to play a card, the player must spend a number of counters equal to the cost of the card. Only interrupts (of the card types in a player's deck) do not have a cost and are treated as 0-cost.Another major change in the gameplay of Second Edition was the new method of handling dilemmas. Instead of using First Edition's lengthy procedure of a 'seed phase', which could last upwards of 15 minutes, Second Edition employs an 'on-the-fly' method for constructing dilemma combinations. While First Edition attempted to sometimes literally represent instances from the Star Trek universe in the game, Second Edition has focused more on a consistency of gameplay as a priority over design consideration with regard to remaining faithful to the source material. Effects on cards sometimes lack the &quot;Trek sense&quot; that First Edition cards contained and can be purely conceptual, but are generally much more equitable when compared with other similarly costed effects.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Decipher English Edition"], "average": "6.75833", "name": "Star Trek Customizable Card Game (Second Edition)", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Secret Unit Deployment"], "age": "0", "usersrated": "192", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Customizable Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["CCGs (Collectible Card Games)", "Star Trek"]}, "40551": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Bertram Kaes"], "average": "6.5", "poll": [], "name": "Emil r\u00e4umt auf!", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1991", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic491704_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Janosch"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic491704.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Environmental"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "In this game based on children's books by Janosch, the players have to recycle several types of garbage, like scrap paper, bulk garbage or organic waste.

Rules can be found for them here.<br/><br/>In 1946, after stunning German victories on both fronts largely attributed to Vergeltungswaffe 4, a compound that kills painfully and resurrects corpses as dangerous animate objects, Franco joined the Axis. Spanish forces backed by Brandenburger commandos and Fallschirmjager Drop Armor assaulted the British held rock of Gibraltar. Germany claimed the ancient fort with its network of caves and aggressively expanded it into a vast underground research, command, and control center, plumbing the depths of the Rock. In 1949, allied forces mount a massive offensive to retake it. The campaign is bloody and hard-fought but ultimately successful. German and Spanish personnel escape by U-boat from underwater chambers. US and British forces enter the German compound only to be beaten back by the horrors that lurk within the vast twisted labyrinth under Gibraltar. Many commanders feel that the only recourse is to seal the caves from the surface, so that is done. Unfortunately it is impossible to determine the lo cation of all of the undersea tunnels. Zombie naval mines damage or destroy numerous smaller vessels and sink the aircraft carrier Lexington as they sally forth from these undersea caves. MI-13 stumbles onto communiqu&eacute;s detailing German SWD plans for a diabolical Doomsday Device under Gibraltar. Given the effectiveness of previous SWD attacks, the credibility of these reports cannot be ignored. The decision is made to clear the caves. MI-13 Commandos and elements of the US Lucky Seventh invade the stronghold in a desperate race to shut down the Doomsday Device before it can be deployed.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>Rigid two piece box covered in art<br/>Glossy 28 page rulebook<br/>Card rules summary/playsheet<br/>4 sheets of two-sided heavy-duty die cut pieces (132 total) including counters, doors and stand-ups for all models<br/>Super Heavy duty two-sided six-fold game board<br/>86 cards (66 card Battle Deck and 10 Model Cards for each side)<br/>3 black dice<br/>36 black plastic stand-up holders for doors and &quot;models&quot;<br/>Vac-formed plastic holding tray<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "second edition"], "average": "7.70336", "name": "Incursion", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": ["98370"], "usersrated": "330", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games", "Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "40604": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic440989.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Rum & Bones"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Francisco Conde", "Gustavo Adolfo Cuadrado", "Santos Prieto"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Alfonso Gir\u00e1ldes Bermejo", "Jose David Lanza Cebrian", "Ivan Gil", "Pedro Nu\u00f1ez", "Simon Remis"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Tale of War"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic440989_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Miniatures", "Pirates"], "description": "Welcome to RON and BONES cabin boy:<br/>The most innovative and impressive strategy game of the 7 seas.

Maybe you want a to give a great gift, or the kids are way too active and you want to give them something new to do. Maybe you are a student, or a teacher or maybe you just enjoy most everything about the Martial Arts.<br/><br/>Well...<br/><br/>Welcome to Martial World's advanced &quot;Trainers Edition&quot; card game. &quot;World Arts On Playing Cards&quot;<br/><br/>As most, who are familiar with our games know, Martial World is an American style strategy game, which challenges players to win martial arts based sparring matches, using technique based &quot;micro messaged&quot; collectible cards. These combat strategy card games combine point-trick mechanics with card-capturing mechanics for deck building purposes. We call the deck building process &quot;Building Your Form&quot;.<br/><br/>Each game box is designed for 2 to 5 players, intended for anyone ages 7 and up, comes with a single magnifying glass, (for a limited time) and no martial arts experience is necessary. Games are easy to learn, easy to develop flexible strategies, and average 90 minutes to establish a winner.<br/><br/>The fun is how cleverly the combination of multiple forms of martial arts technique terms, combine into round robin melees of attacks, blocks, and counter maneuvers. Here's how. Players spar in rounds which are initiated by the role of the dice and the round winners keeps the technique cards to add to their form. Another fun feature for players who are not sparring is that they may enjoy the micro messages which, for the white belt levels, display each school's core principals and values. You may even be surprised that most of these messages can be applied to every day life. So playing has good life benefits.<br/><br/>Ultimately our novel mechanics, embedded surprises, and our school based narrative features, provide players the opportunity to experience the many benefits of martial arts without the Epson salt. All may play and enjoy.<br/><br/>Designer's Note: All of our games are designed based on the history of real martial arts and may include many of each school's or style's myths. However folks, this is a game. Let's be honest, the only way to truly learn any form of Martial Arts is to do research and depending on your ideals, you will find a style which appeals you. Besides that, we are a USA based company and our games are made in America. We were originally published in 1992 but needed a lot of work. We kept pushing and in 2011 we were nominated for the Gaming Genius Awards as the best new card game. We were finalists but needed many upgrades. So we upgraded everything. Lastly we are members of our local gaming group CABS and have a membership with the Patent Tested Parent Approved association.<br/><br/>We welcome all feedback and recommendations. You may also zoom in to all of our pictures for samples of hidden surprises...<br/><br/>"}, "40643": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Sonar Sea Battle", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1989", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic955053_t.jpg", "average": "6.66667", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Radio Shack"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic955053.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Electronic", "Modern Warfare", "Nautical"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "This game is an electronic game, similar to Battleship made by Radio Shack/Tandy.

A race in decline is designated by flipping the tiles over to their black-and-white side.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn, you score one point (coin) for each territory your races occupy. You may have one active race and one race in decline on the board at the same time. Your occupation total can vary depend on the special abilities of your race and the territories they occupy.

For this, they have two workers, a large one and a smaller one, and a set of 5 cards for each worker to move them. There is a scale with counters (for each worker 1 counter) depicting which worker moves first, second and so on).<br/>                                                 <br/>In a turn, all players secretly choose one of the numbered cards from each of their card sets.<br/><br/>For the worker which is the first to move, the player revealed the appropriate card and moves his worker the amount of spaces as stated by his card. When one of the workers land on an occupied space, the (passive) worker is pushed to the opposite side of the warehouse. When this place is already occupied the (passive) worker won't move. The (active) worker will be moved back to the next unoccupied place.<br/>When all players have made their moves, the warehouses are checked if there is a worker next to a chamber. Players take as many drums in their colour as barrels in the room they are next to. The barrels are placed in one or more of the ships in the harbour (4 ships); players may decide freely.  <br/>                                                  <br/>When a worker is next to a room where broken barrels are, the player must take as many drums in his colour from any of the ships. When a worker is next to a room depicting also a silver coin, the player gets a silver piece from the common stock.<br/>Majorities with barrels on ships are important for scoring points. When a ship is fully loaded, or if it is the leftmost ship, loaded or not, it gets scored at the end of the round after which it is taken away (barrels/drums goes back to the players stock); the other ships move left accordingly and a new ship is taken from a blind stack of ships tiles.  <br/>There are scores for first, second and third positions (the latter in a game of 3 or 4 players) on the ship. <br/>For the next round the last worker (in play order) will become first worker (shifting the counter on the scale).<br/><br/>For three silver coins an extra worker for the current round can be bought, but this worker always must be the first to move in a round. This worker gets no penalty if his move ends near a room with broken barrels.<br/><br/>The configuration of the warehouse cards each game is different, as these are loose tiles. When the stack is depleted, the game ends.<br/> <br/>Game Summary<br/>The board shows a randomly ordered group of 7/8 (3er/4er) warehouses, each with 2 rooms containing 0-4 good barrels or 0-2 broken barrels, and 0-1 coin. This is surrounded by a looped movement path with stops in front of each storeroom. Players each have 2 dock workers (Big and Little) which start at opposite ends of the board (off the path initially), and 2 sets of movement cards numbered 1-5 (one set per worker). There are 4 piers, each with a random boat with room for 3 or more barrels. At the start, pier 1 has a &quot;pilot&quot; boat -- occupies space but cannot load goods. Finally, token movement order is set randomly at the beginning of the game: chits corresponding to all workers are placed in a row in random order.<br/><br/>Each round, players first have the option to pay 3 coins to hire Lazy Jack for this turn (if several want to hire him, priority goes to player with fewer VP). Place the Lazy Jack token with one of your workers. Then, everyone selects and simultaneously reveals a movement card for each worker. If you hired Lazy Jack, play an additional card of the same type (Big/Little) as whoever you placed Lazy Jack with. The workers than all move in token movement order, with Lazy Jack moving first. If they land on another worker, they shift that worker to the opposite side of the movement path, unless that space is already occupied; in that case, the moving worker moves backwards to the first empty space on the path.<br/><br/>After all tokens have moved, resolve the warehouses in order from one side of the board to the other. If a coin is present, take one from the bank. If there are good barrels in the storeroom, take as many from your stock and load them onto any boat(s). If you take the last open spot, score 1VP and the boat sails: players with barrels on board score VP based on majority (last place scores nothing; ties will score average of sum of ranks, rounding up). Immediately move other boats forward in the pier track, and place a new boat at the last pier. If there are broken barrels in the storeroom, remove as many of your barrels from the boats (exception: Lazy Jack does not unload).<br/><br/>If there are now 3 or fewer boats in the piers, the game will end -- score all boats and most VP wins.<br/><br/>If not, the boat at pier 1 scores, then sails away (immediately advance all boats and draw a new one). Finally, if you had dipped into the last 6 boats this turn, randomize the token movement order. Otherwise, the token last in movement order moves up to 1st position.

You do this by awarding yourself bonuses at regular intervals and by brazenly embezzling your own bank's Assets and hiding them when no one else is looking. If you get caught embezzling, you lose a Trust card and you remember how important Trust is, right?<br/><br/>Surviving the Crunch<br/>Occasionally, the Crunch will hit and all CEOs have to make sure they can cover all the money they've lent out with the total value of Assets in their banks. If they can't, it's government bailout time or bust. But don't worry too much if that happens because if you've managed to bonus and embezzle enough, you can still win the game, even if you go bankrupt first.<br/><br/>Remember, you could run a model bank for the entire duration of the game, but if you fail to look after number one, you risk ending up yachtless.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Edge French edition", "Edge Spanish edition", "Esticorp Estonian edition", "Exile Games English edition", "Heidelberger German edition", "Stratelibri Italian edition 2010", "Terrorbull English edition 2009"], "average": "5.76276", "name": "Crunch: The Game for Utter Bankers", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Betting/Wagering", "Commodity Speculation", "Voting"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "340", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BGWS 059 \u2013 Crunch", "BGWS 070: Breaking Up the Monopoly"]}, "40873": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic444929.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jorge Arroyo"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["P.

A breakthrough here, as well as further south at Sedan, would split the Allied forces in two. A protracted and bloody battle was not in the German war plans...speed was of the essence...the blitzkrieg depended on it...Hitler demanded it!<br/>The French forces, caught off balance by the sudden attack, were initially aided by the terrain but not for long. Rommel was a determined foe and the Meuse River was looked upon as only a temporary delay. It proved a little more than that and provided the vital time for the French armor division to move into the area despite harassing Ju-87 dive bombers and a lack of fuel and organization.<br/>The Panzers soon found how inferior their little armored tanks were against the likes of the Char B, which could split any of the panzer metal from long range. Even the lighter French tanks were as good or better. In fact, Rommel only had 24 Pz IV's, which could take on the French tanks. His remaining 68 Pz II or 91 Czech-38 were simply too weak in armor and and in gun.. The French 47mm gun could rip a Pz III apart from 1500 yds. However, the French use and slowness negated their armor and gun to a large extent. German tanks were faster and well commanded and could take on the French tanks by firing from the rear or flank.<br/>The Battle at Dinant was a tough fight, but across the sweeping vistas of France, the fast moving Germans caused a French command in chaos. Rommel would also have another surprise in another week or so at Arras. There, the British sent chills down the German command when Matilda IIs launched their counterattack. German fire simply bounced off their thick armor causing Rommel to get desperate. He ordered his four 88mm AA guns to be used at antitank weapons. The rest is history.<br/><br/>The game scale:<br/>Each day turn represents about one and half hours (night turns are 5 to 6 hours).

A d6 and a d100 is rolled for each side.  The d6 determines how many officers(state) or leaders(guerrillas) are present; the d100 result is the number of troops.  The two rolls together determine the force's mission.<br/><br/>For example, a roll of 3/13 gives the state forces one major, two captains, 3 lieutenants and 13 troops.   Their mission reads, &quot;You have captured one important guerrilla leader and must escort him, alive, from one corner of the table to the opposite for a show trial. Convoy.&quot;  A roll of 6/50 gives the guerrilla forces 6 leaders (and, as a 6 was rolled, one of them must be secretly designated the chief leader of the war) and 50 troops.  Their mission reads, &quot;Funeral of a fighter, now a martyr, being used to whip up support.  The three most senior leaders are at the graveside with both parents of the victim.  Next the enthusiastic fighters form a ring, surrounded by the reliable and unreliable fighters mixed, who are in turn surrounded by the fanatics and remaining leaders. Company.&quot;<br/><br/>The way in which troops are deployed on the board is determined by cross-indexing the mission type of each side on a table.  In the above example, the state's mission type is &quot;convoy&quot; and the guerrillas' is &quot;company,&quot; which gives &quot;deploy company first then start convoy.&quot;<br/><br/>A d10 is rolled to determine the location, which can range from &quot;Steep hill country&quot; or &quot;dense woodland&quot; to &quot;city back streets&quot; or &quot;market town, market day, very crowded.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "40952": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Sailor Boy", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1889", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic450050_t.jpg", "average": "0", "boardgamepublisher": ["J.H.
