But it is definitely not just for hard-core gamers: Pearl Lands&rsquo; target audience is the newbies and board game enthusiasts who wants to introduce their friends to the joy of board games. It&rsquo;s a perfect game for family gatherings and social game nights. It&rsquo;s light, easy to learn and set up, and can be finished in 30 to 90 minutes.<br/><br/>Game has different strategy elements like attacking opponents to steal their resources, trading resources with players or the bank, and using universe cards to change the course of the game (sometimes just slightly and sometimes drastically). Its combat mechanics is similar to Risk, while trade aspect gives it more like a Catan style strategy element. However there is no tile or troop movement factor that complicate things: it&rsquo;s designed to be fun and straightforward.<br/><br/>Pearl Lands is full of surprises: the game can turn even at the last round. However it&rsquo;s not a game of pure luck. The player with long term winning strategy will definitely have the upper hand, and most likely will be the target of other players banding together against her. Alliances are of the utmost importance. Cunning players will find the game to their liking, but utilizing only the art of deception may not be enough to win the game. Sometimes desperate measures like a kamikaze attack to destroy five resource crystals by sacrificing an attack ship can change the balance of power. And buying universe cards can pay off greatly if you get one extra attack or defense die, or get to change the resource setup on the board to sabotage an opponent's game plan.<br/><br/>If you want a simple, fun board game with strategy elements and a competitive gameplay, you may want to give Pearl Lands a try.<br/><br/>Story of Pearl Lands<br/><br/>The discovery of Pearl Lands, a galaxy with abundant resources, changed the face of the space race forever.

A green rain made of grain, discovered on a Pearl Lands&rsquo; planet, created a new energy source for space technologies, and a curious little yellow flower with beautiful petals provided Mana, a seed to be cultivated with utmost care. So, with these three new resources previously unknown to mankind, space travel to the farthest points of the Pearl Lands galaxy became a reality, and with the establishment of colony after colony Pearl Lands has become a new home for mankind.<br/><br/>Of course, war has never ended.

Ideal for use as allies, cohorts, long-running NPCs, or replacement player characters, Liz Courts brings you amazingly detailed and lushly developed characters including:<br/><br/>    Brynla, half-orc druid of the green faith<br/>    Maja Tasker, halfling investigator sleuth<br/>    Pero, human summoner and his otherworldly protector, Drahu<br/>    Roelof, dwarf witch guardian of the ley lines<br/>    Stojan, snowborn elf two-handed fighter<br/>    Zakhar, snowborn elf oracle<br/>    Zuza Holt, human herald of the horn skald<br/>    and last but not least, the shadow-sneak Senka Featherfingers, fetchling rogue!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Built according to organized play specifications, using the 20-point-buy method and with scaling notes for 15-point builds, these characters are not just piles of statistics. Each one is as much about story as combat, with robust links built in to each other as well as the official Witches of Winter Adventure Path, though every one easily stands on its own in any setting where savage barbarians battle technological terrors. The crunch for every character more than measures up to its incredible flavor text, though, and when it&rsquo;s time to throw down in combat none of these Winter Heroes will be stepping to the sidelines.<br/><br/>Each character includes a detailed backstory, roleplaying tips, special equipment, and links to the published campaign, including a campaign trait selection from the Witches of Winter Adventure Path player&rsquo;s guide. Each also lists detailed level advancement information for their first few levels, with further suggestions for developing the character's long-term mechanical build.

In this game, the players take on the roles of criminals on the wrong side of the law, collectively known as the Right Kind of People to those who run in outlaw circles. These criminals come together to form a crew, and take on a Job, a criminal enterprise brokered to them by a third party.<br/><br/>Each member of the crew is a member of one of the eight cartels that rule over the city&rsquo;s criminal underworld. These cartels each have their own turf, their own specialties, their own motives, and their own methods, but they are all bound together by the Arrangement, an agreement that the cartels entered into to preserve themselves against too much infighting. In short, the cartels agree that they have enough enemies without warring with one another, and that they all want the same thing: to get rich. The cartels agree to respect each others' turf, and while some bickering and fighting is allowed, large-scale conflict is forbidden, and revenge is frowned upon.<br/><br/>To maintain this peace, when someone from the cartels has a Job they want done, they call upon the crew, which has members from several cartels, to pull off the Job. Each cartel gets a cut of the take from that Job, and the crew gains some wealth, prestige, and influence, plus the promise of future Jobs from those brokers.<br/><br/>Once the Job has been assigned, the crew must come up with a plan, do the legwork to set it into motion, pull off the plan, and then survive long enough to get paid.<br/><br/>"}, "220554": {"poll": [], "name": "Convicted Galaxy", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Space"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Mind Grown Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Life Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Mind Grown Software"], "description": "Stranded in an unknown galaxy full of escaped prisoners who grow stronger with every passing moment.

Exploring one of the world&rsquo;s most prominent experiments with nonviolent resistance, Gandhi takes us to the subcontinent of India, the jewel in the crown of the British Empire, for a detailed look at the final decades of the British Raj. 1 to 4 players compete to determine the future of India; will the transition to home rule be a peaceful one, will India be split apart by partition or civil war, or will it remain firmly in the grip of empire?<br/><br/>Gandhi offers a fresh perspective on the history of insurgency with the addition of a new type of faction to the COIN Series, the Nonviolent (NV) faction, while retaining the multi-faction, asymmetrical, card-assisted system of earlier titles in the COIN Series. COIN veterans will be able to jump right in.<br/><br/>Other features include:<br/><br/>     Gandhi as the game&rsquo;s sole leader piece.<br/>     Nonviolent operations and special activities.<br/>     Nonviolent activists that are always active, but generally immune from Raj actions until engaged in protests (or caught up in post-terror reprisals).<br/>     Protests that erode support but leave activists vulnerable to arrest by Raj forces.<br/>     A Hindu-Muslim Unity track that measures tensions between these two communities, affecting resources, operations, and victory.<br/>     A British Rule track that reflects shifts in colonial policy in response to events on the map, from resolve to restraint, affecting the cost of several actions.<br/>     British Viceroys who come and go with each passing campaign and have their own unique effects on each faction.<br/>     An out-of-play jail space that holds nonviolent forces arrested during martial law. Pieces can be kept in jail over several campaigns, but at a cost to the Raj.<br/>     Independent Princely States that are never controlled by any faction, yet offer a haven for violent and nonviolent insurgents alike.<br/>     Short and medium-length scenarios that allow for the study of different periods of the struggle against British rule in India.<br/>     Support for solitaire, 2-player, 3-player, and 4-player games.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In Gandhi, players will face a range of difficult and interesting strategic choices. Following in the innovative footsteps of previous COIN titles, Gandhi weaves together historical, political, and cultural threads and offers an opportunity to study nonviolent and violent resistance in one of the most significant colonial possessions from the age of European imperialism. Civil disobedience and non-cooperation, protests and terror, imperialism and constructive programme, growing unrest, negotiation, agitation, assassination, persuasion, boycotts, martial law, and many other options await.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Gandhi made it impossible for us to go on ruling India, but at the same time he made it possible for us to abdicate without rancor and without dishonour.&rdquo;<br/>&mdash; British Historian Arnold Toynbee<br/><br/>"}, "220589": {"average": "10", "poll": [], "name": "Teddy Hedz", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Deck / Pool Building", "Dice Rolling", "Rock-Paper-Scissors", "Take That"], "yearpublished": "2017", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3544161_t.png", "boardgameartist": ["Anthea Wright"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3544161.png", "boardgameversion": ["Ver 0.9"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Dice", "Fighting", "Miniatures", "Print & Play"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Teddy Hedz, or THZ for short, is a card game in which you attempt to hit your opponent repeatedly with a range of soft plush toy animal heads.

Only those who are best at each category &ndash; knowledge, creativity, action, social and games &ndash; can be the lucky winner at the end. Are you ready? Then get ready for this one-of-a-kind challenge!<br/><br/>INTERACTION is an innovative hybrid board game which combines all the fun of a classic board game with the benefits of an app. The result is a unique and breathtaking gaming experience.<br/><br/>+++    GAME COMPONENTS   +++<br/><br/>INTERACTION includes the following components:<br/><br/>&bull;    1 game box<br/>&bull;    1 puzzle game board<br/>&bull;    1 W6 dice<br/>&bull;    1 capacitive pen<br/>&bull;    3 play markers (green, blue and orange)<br/>&bull;    3 large playing pieces (green, blue and orange) <br/>&bull;    1 card set, consisting of:<br/>        15 Knowledge Cards<br/>        15 Creative Cards<br/>        15 Action Cards<br/>        15 Social Cards<br/>        15 Games Cards<br/>        15 Nasty Cards<br/>&bull;    1 activation card<br/>&bull;    1 support card<br/>&bull;    1 letter<br/>&bull;    1 product folder<br/>&bull;    1 quick start guide<br/><br/>+++    BEFORE THE FIRST GAME   +++<br/><br/>Before the first round of play, the players have to take care of a few small things.<br/><br/>DESIGN OF THE GAME FIGURES (MEEBS)<br/>The game comes with green, orange and blue playing pieces as well as a sheet of stickers with eyes and mouths. Each team gets a playing piece in their desired color and the matching sticker set. The teams can then design their playing piece (Meeb) accordingly.<br/><br/>INSTALLATION OF THE INTERACTION APP<br/>One player needs to download the free game app onto their smartphone or tablet. To do so, they open the following web address in the browser on their device: <a target='_blank' href='https://interaction-game.com/app' rel='nofollow'>https://interaction-game.com/app</a><br/>The website forwards the player automatically to the right app in the Apple Store or Google Play Store.<br/>The player downloads the app &ndash; note: additional charges for data could apply, depending on the network provider &ndash; and installs it onto their smartphone or tablet. Once the installation is complete, the player starts the app.<br/><br/>SETTING UP THE ACCOUNT<br/>In order to play, at least one player needs to have a free &quot;combined games&quot; account. If the player doesn't have a &quot;combined games&quot; account yet, they can open one directly in the app. To do so, the player presses the &quot;Register Account&quot; button in the app, enters their email address and chooses a password. To complete the registration, the player presses on the &quot;Register&quot; button. The player can then complete their player profile (optional).<br/>Note: To activate the account, the player must click on the link in the confirmation email within 30 days.<br/><br/>ACTIVATE THE GAME<br/>Next, the player enters the code on the activation card into the INTERACTION app when prompted. This activates the game and opens up the available game content.<br/><br/><br/>+++    GAME PREPARATIONS   +++<br/><br/>APP SETTIINGS<br/>One player starts the app, logging into his &quot;combined games&quot; account. The player then selects the appropriate number of players (name and age) and adds them to the individual teams (orange, green or blue). Up to three players can play on a single team. The player then presses &quot;Next&quot;.<br/><br/>ASSEMBLING THE GAME BOARD<br/>The players put together the puzzle pieces that make up the game board and place the part with the progress box in the center.<br/><br/>PREPARE PLAYING CARDS<br/>Players then shuffle the 5 Category Cards and the Nasty Card stacks separately and place them next to the game board. Each team then draws three cards from the Nasty Card stack.<br/><br/>READY, SET, GO!<br/>Each team now places the round wooden marker of their color on the start area (with the arrow) in the progress box in the middle of the game board. They then place the playing piece (Meeb) of their color on the Joker or the start area in that color (with the star) in the action area of the game board.<br/>Finally, one player presses &quot;Next&quot; in the app to start the game.<br/><br/>+++    HOW TO PLAY   +++<br/><br/>In each round of play, every player on a team has a turn to play. The INTERACTION app displays the current player. Each player goes through the following phases of the game in one round:<br/><br/>ROLL THE DICE<br/>The current player rolls the red dice and moves their team's playing piece (Meeb) clockwise around the action field based on the number on the dice. The player then presses &quot;Next&quot; in the app.<br/><br/>SELECT CATEGORY<br/>The player presses the symbol for their playing piece (Meeb) in the app; this selects the play category (knowledge, creativity, action, social or games). If the playing piece is on a Joker field (marked with a star), the player can choose whatever category they want in the app. The app now automatically selects a mini-game in the corresponding category for the player. The player acknowledges this by pressing &quot;Next&quot;.<br/><br/>PLAY THE CARDS<br/>The teams now have the opportunity to play as many cards as they like. They are of the following types:<br/><br/>Nasty Cards<br/>Opposing teams can use these cards to make the current player's game task more difficult. For each card played, the current player presses the Nasty symbol in the app.<br/><br/>Lovely and Category Cards <br/>The player's own team can play Category Cards to make their team member's task easier. The current player presses the Lovely symbol in the app. Opposing team play these cards to make the current player's task more difficult, just like the Shitty Cards. The active player then presses the Shitty symbol in the app.<br/><br/>Joker Cards<br/>The red Joker Cards can be used to &quot;steal&quot; the mini-game from the current player. If someone plays a Joker Card, the player then presses the corresponding symbol in the app. In the next step, the team that played the Joker Card now chooses one player to complete the game task.<br/>But be careful! There are special rules here:<br/>&bull;    If the new player solves the game task, then:<br/>    + The original team draws the top card from the corresponding category stack,<br/>    + The team that stole the task moves their wooden marker ahead one space in the progress box.<br/>&bull;    If the new player does not solve the task:<br/>    + The original team can move their wooden marker ahead one space in the progress box.<br/>    + If the new team doesn't solve<br/><br/>PLAYING MINI GAMES<br/>The selected mini-game now starts. The specific tasks vary based on the age, location and interests of the player. They simply follow the instructions in the app to master the game task.<br/><br/>VICTORY AND DEFEAT<br/>Draw cards<br/>If the player has won the mini-game, they must draw the top card from the respective category stack. If not, they must take one from the &quot;Shitty&quot; stack.<br/>Attention: A team can hold a maximum of 5 cards; if a team already has 5 cards, they cannot take any more cards.<br/><br/>Exchange cards<br/>Regardless of whether or not the active player has won or lost the min-game, their team can exchange three cards in the same category in the team color or three cards from different categories. Joker Cards function as wild cards here, representing any category card in the team color. Changing the cards triggers a special action in the progress box. The player simply follows the instructions in the app.<br/>Possible special functions can include, for example:<br/>&bull;    Advance to the next team<br/>&bull;    Move all opposing teams back 1 space<br/>&bull;    Advance 3 spaces<br/>&bull;    Take one card from each opposing team<br/><br/>Moving the marker<br/>If the current player has successfully completed the mini-game, he can move his team's round wooden marker ahead one space in the progress box.<br/><br/>The player completes their turn by pressing the &quot;Next&quot; button in the app and the next player rolls the dice to start their turn.<br/><br/>+++    THE AIM OF THE GAME   +++<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to move the round wooden marker to the final space in the progress box by solving the mini-games. The game ends as soon as one team moves their marker into the final space.<br/><br/>"}, "220598": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3463334.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ben Pinchback", "Matt Riddle"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2017", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Andy Jewett"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Green Couch Games"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3463334_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "description": "Ladder 29 is a hot game of ladder-climbing firefighters.

They have to search for the teenagers inside the house, possibly defending them if a premature death isn't what they planned...<br/><br/>"}, "220633": {"rpgdesigner": ["Josh Gentry"], "statistics": [], "name": "EN5ider (Issue 110 - Oct 2016)", "rpgartist": ["Ellis Goodson"], "rpgproducer": ["James Haeck", "Eric Life-Putnam"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3417439.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["EN5ider"], "rpgissuearticle": ["The Greater Secrets: New Options for Cardcasters"], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (5th Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["EN Publishing"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3417439_t.jpg", "description": "EN5ider<br/>Issue 110<br/>October 2016<br/><br/>The Greater Secrets: New Options for Cardcasters<br/><br/>"}, "220634": {"rpgartist": ["Ellis Goodson", "Mike Myler"], "statistics": [], "name": "EN5ider (Issue 111 - Oct 2016)", "rpgdesigner": ["Mike Myler"], "rpgproducer": ["James Haeck", "Eric Life-Putnam"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3417444.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["EN5ider"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Searching the River Styx"], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (5th Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["EN Publishing"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3417444_t.jpg", "description": "EN5ider<br/>Issue 111<br/>October 2016<br/><br/>Searching the River Styx<br/><br/>"}, "220635": {"rpgdesigner": ["GM Lent"], "statistics": [], "name": "EN5ider (Issue 112 - Nov 2016)", "rpgartist": ["Michael McCarthy", "Alexandre Silveira"], "rpgproducer": ["James Haeck", "Eric Life-Putnam"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3417446.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["EN5ider"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Over the Next Hill: CIty of Hidden Ways"], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (5th Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["EN Publishing"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3417446_t.jpg", "description": "EN5ider<br/>Issue 112<br/>November 2016<br/><br/>Over the Next Hill: City of Hidden Ways<br/><br/>"}, "220636": {"rpgdesigner": ["Kiel Chenier"], "statistics": [], "name": "EN5ider (Issue 113 - Nov 2016)", "rpgartist": ["James Shields", "Egil Thompson"], "rpgproducer": ["James Haeck", "Eric Life-Putnam"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3417447.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["EN5ider"], "rpgissuearticle": ["A Blade for All Seasons:  Gifts of the Forge"], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (5th Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["EN Publishing"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3417447_t.jpg", "description": "EN5ider<br/>Issue 113<br/>November 2016<br/><br/>A Blade for All Seasons: Gifts of the Forge<br/><br/>"}, "220637": {"rpgdesigner": ["Ambrose Ingram"], "statistics": [], "name": "EN5ider (Issue 114 - Nov 2016)", "rpgartist": ["Phil Stone"], "rpgproducer": ["James Haeck", "Eric Life-Putnam"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3417448.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["EN5ider"], "rpgissuearticle": ["The Devil's Footlocker"], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (5th Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["EN Publishing"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3417448_t.jpg", "description": "EN5ider<br/>Issue 114<br/>November 2016<br/><br/>The Devil's Footlocker: A Collection of Cursed Trinkets<br/><br/>"}, "220638": {"rpgartist": ["Ellis Goodson"], "statistics": [], "name": "EN5ider (Issue 115 - Nov 2016)", "rpgdesigner": ["Mark A.

The card game used characters encompassing virtually all of the main numbered titles in the video games with the exception of Suikoden V which did not appear in the cards at all. All of the cards as well as the rules are in Japanese only as the game has never been made available outside of Japan.<br/><br/>The game is a trading card game in which players draw cards from their respective decks and take turns playing cards onto the field. Each player uses a deck containing 50 cards. Before the game begins the players agree on a set number of VP (Victory Points) needed to win the game, the rule book suggesting 5 VP being the standard amount to win. Much like many other card games the game can also be won if the player's opponent cannot draw any more cards from their deck.<br/><br/>Players prepare their 50 card deck before the game and once prepared and turn order established, begin the game. Player's place Mission cards and attempt to fulfill the card's qualifications in order to acquire the VP gifted by the card, as marked on the card itself. The opposing player can also attempt to fulfill the cards qualifications, winning the VP for themselves.<br/><br/>Besides this, players can also attempt to construct Facilities cards. They are built in much the same way as Mission cards are played but do not provide VP. If the player succeeds in building the Facilities card they played, they gain the bonus granted by that card. If the opposing player wins, however, the Facilities card is considered to have been destroyed and no bonus is granted to either player. Character cards are used to either attack mission cards to earn the VP or to either build or destroy facilities depending on who played the Facilities card.<br/><br/>Play continues in this manner, with control passing between each player at the end of each turn until one player meets one of the victory conditions listed above.<br/><br/>"}, "220662": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Mizzerene, the Black Rose", "rpgdesigner": ["Jacky Leung"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3417841.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Death By Mage"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3417841_t.jpg", "description": "An Encounter with a Powerful Fey in the Feywild<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/><br/>An elegant, calm woman draped in a gown of red roses and thorns.

In turn order, every player play an instrument card on the board, choose an instrument and place its note discs on the choosen instrument. Each instrument plays a fixed number of notes and has two kind of abilities: an ability always-on, and another that is activated only if the instrument is placed in the proper location for its acoustics.<br/><br/>2) During the  Symphony Phase, the so arranged orchestra plays the music score, which is modular, and therefore different in each game. The orchestra is divided into 5 columns, and each column plays in a specific part of the score (for example, column A plays in the first 2 bars, column B in the second, third and fourth, and so on). When a column of instruments has finished its notes, the next column plays, and so on. Within a column, the lower instrument start playing a note, then the instrument immediately above plays a note, and so on, upward. Once at the top, the lower instrument plays again, and so on, until all the notes of the column are played. Obviously the player who has their note disks on the instrument controls is it, and decide where to place the related disks to score VPs. In this way, the game is not subdivided in player tyrns, but rather into instrument turns.<br/><br/>The main aim is to play better than their opponents (= score more VPs), so it is not important to play many notes, but play them properly. First, each note provides VPs according to the Voice that is placed on (1-3 VPs). Secondly, there are extra VPs for the Sheet note majorities (at the completiion of each sheet) and Voice note majorities (at the end of game). Also, different areas or notes on the music score are Scoring Areas, and grant you to advance on corresponding Scoring Tracks to score extra PV at the end of the game. Finally, some notes, as well as the placement of the initial instruments, provide yous Bonuses, that can be placed on your instruments (max 1 for Instrument) to potentiate their effects. So, to play better in such melodious context requires a careful strategy and good tactics.<br/><br/>Type: Eurogame<br/>Target: soft gamers (Base mod.) / hard gamers (Advanced mod.)<br/>Modalities: Basic and Advanced<br/><br/><br/>Porta la tua compagnia sul palco, e fonditi con le altre, a formare un'Orchestra!<br/>Drafta gli strumenti migliori a disposizione in ogni partita, piazzali nella posizione ideale per la loro acustica, ed infine suona ... la Sinfonia (cos&igrave; da totalizzare pi&ugrave; Punti Vittoria)!<br/>Ogni strumento suona in un modo diverso, ogni Spartito &egrave; diverso, ogni partita sublime!<br/><br/>Ogni partita a Symphony &eacute; divisa in 2 Fasi: la Fase Orchestra e la Fase Sonata.<br/><br/>1) Durante la fase Orchestra, l'Orchestra viene formata disponendo le carte Strumento, ed i giocatori, gradualmente, prendono possesso degli Strumenti che preferiscono, piazzando, a turno i propri dischi nota, sullo Strumento che scelgono. Ogni Strumento suona un numero prefissato di note e dispone di due abilit&agrave;: una sempre attiva, e l'altra che &egrave; attiva solo se lo Strumento &egrave; piazzato opportunamente, in una posizione appropriata per la sua acustica.<br/><br/>2) durante la fase Suonata, l'Orchestra cos&igrave; formata suona sullo Spartito, che &egrave; modulare, e quindi diverso in ogni partita. L'Orchestra &egrave; divisa in colonne, e ciascuna colonna, suona in una parte specifica dello spartito (ad esempio, la colonna A suona nelle prime 2 battute). Quando una colonna di Strumenti ha terminato le proprie note, suona la colonna successiva, e cos&igrave; via. All'interno di una colonna, suona prima una nota lo Strumento pi&ugrave; in basso, poi una nota quello subito sopra, e cos&igrave; via, a salire. Arrivati in cima, riparte lo Strumento pi&ugrave; in basso, e cos&igrave; via, fino ad esaurire le note della Colonna. Chiaramente il giocatore che ha i propri dischi su uno Strumento, lo controlla, e decide dove piazzare le relative note per ottenere i PV. In questo modo il gioco non ha una normale suddivisione di turni dei giocatori, quanto piuttosto una suddivisione in turni degli Strumenti.<br/><br/>Dato che lo scopo &egrave; suonare meglio dei propri avversari (ovvero realizzare pi&ugrave; PV), non &egrave; importante suonare tante note, ma suonarle opportunamente. Innanzitutto ogni nota fornisce PV in base alla Voce su cui &egrave; piazzata. Secondariamente, vi sono dei PV extra per le maggioranze di Foglio (al termine di ogni Foglio) e di Voce (a fine partita). Inoltre, diverse aree dello Spartito sono Aree Punteggio, che fanno avanzare su appositi Tracciati Punteggio e forniscono PV extra a fine partita. Infine, alcune note, cos&igrave; come il piazzamento degli Strumenti iniziali, forniscono dei bonus Musicista, che possono essere piazzati sui propri Strumenti (max 1 per Strumento) per potenziarne gli effetti. A causa di tutto ci&ograve;, prevalere in un simile contesto melodioso richiede un'attenta strategia ed una buona tattica.<br/><br/>Tipologia: Tedesco                                               Target: soft gamers (mod.

This helps to keep the game focussed on the action and adventure rather than the rules and the system.<br/><br/>If you like animal stories and you're fond of the original role playing game then I'm sure you'll love Woodland Warriors.<br/><br/>"}, "220730": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Brian Kelley"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Scarlet Pimpernel", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Variable Player Powers", "Worker Placement"], "yearpublished": "2018", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgameartist": ["Ian O'Toole"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Eagle-Gryphon Games"], "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Novel-based"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "BACKGROUND<br/>The year is 1793. France cowers under the Reign of Terror, and not even the innocent are safe from the Committee of Public Safety and their precious guillotine. In the midst of this turmoil, one man uses courage and cunning to fight the brutality: The Scarlet Pimpernel.<br/><br/>Along with his League of followers, The Scarlet Pimpernel rescues the innocent from under the very noses of the Committee, leaving behind only a card showing a small pimpernel flower. The man behind the rescues, Englishman Sir Percy Blakeney, must keep his identity a secret from all but his closest associates.<br/><br/>In Scarlet Pimpernel, you play as members of the league helping the Scarlet Pimpernel accomplish seven missions, rescuing the innocent from the guillotine. No mission will be as important as the last, for you save the young Dauphin, heir to the French throne, by whisking him away to Vienna.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE<br/>In The Scarlet Pimpernel, players reveal a mission card as the &ldquo;current mission.&rdquo; Each mission card has a location and a required number of supporters and resources.<br/><br/>As a member of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, you help carry out missions by securing the route and location, obtaining the required number of supporters and resources (horses, carts, papers, and disguises), and filling the five mission spaces. This task is done by placing your cubes in various locations on the board to score points. Although players work together to accomplish missions, only the player with the highest score at the end of the game will become the Scarlet Pimpernel&rsquo;s most trusted advisor.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>Gameplay starts with the player who has the first player marker and proceeds clockwise. On your turn, you must either TAKE AN ACTION or PASS. You may additionally USE A REST CUBE after your initial action. The round ends when each of the five mission spaces has a cube on it, OR all players have passed in succession. You then move on to completing the mission.<br/><br/>On your turn, you must take an action or pass. Actions available to you on your turn include the basic action on your player tile OR actions listed on any ONE Special Favor tile you have collected. The basic action on your player tile allows a choice between two actions: Move Your Pawn or Place a Cube. Special favor tiles give you two actions denoted by the &ldquo;+&rdquo; symbol.<br/><br/>ABOUT SPECIAL FAVORS<br/>When a cube is first placed in any of the six planning areas the player placing the cube takes the corresponding special favor tile and attached special favor card and places it to the right of his or her player tile. The characters on the tiles you possess grant you &ldquo;special favors&rdquo;. You may use the actions listed on the attached special favor card.<br/><br/>END OF ROUND / GAME<br/>Play continues until each of the five mission spaces has a cube on it OR all players have passed in succession. When this happens you immediately complete the current mission.

This medieval-themed game combines elements of collusion, misdirection, risk taking and deduction. Successful players must manage the tension and uncertainty surrounding 4 Specialists, including the powerful Raven.<br/><br/>The game is played with 56 suited cards &mdash; Shields, Swords, Axes, and Waters numbered 1 (low) to 14 (high) and 4 special cards (specialists).  Each hand features a different trump suit.  Players must sacrifice cards from their hands to bid the number of tricks they will take.  Each suit conveys a bid value:  0, 1, 2, or 3.  The suit (not the rank) of the cards chosen determines how many tricks the player must take. Score 1 point per trick taken, plus a bonus for an exact bid.<br/><br/>The specialists are:  <br/><br/>        Raven &mdash;  the highest trump<br/>        Wolf &mdash; the highest non-trump<br/>        Shaman &mdash; a half-step higher than the card it immediately follows<br/>        Dwarf &mdash; the lowest card<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Each player tries to take (win) the exact number of tricks bid.  Deception and collusion are allowed and include saying:  how many tricks you bid; what cards you hold; that you want a particular trick; that you won&rsquo;t take a trick; and lying about any or all of these things.  You can say what you like, but you cannot show your cards before you play them.<br/><br/>Card play mechanics are typical for the trick-taking family of games: The player left of the dealer leads.  Play proceeds clockwise.  A player who can follow suit must either (1) follow suit or (2) play a specialist. A player who cannot follow suit may play any card.<br/><br/>The player with the most points after 8 hands wins.

This book is designed with the very experienced player in mind as it presents alternate rules and classes that are more suited to their needs.<br/><br/>Overview:<br/><br/>    Awakening System: This system allows a character to reach &ldquo;enlightenment&rdquo; by accepting (on a personal/spiritual level) certain universal truths. When gained, they are a vulnerability (as accepting them is painful and difficult to one&rsquo;s self-identity) that, once they reach a certain level of realization, is replaced by a powerful bonus. Once several have been &ldquo;realized&rdquo; all realized awakenings become &ldquo;Enlightenments&rdquo;, as it takes the realization of many fundamental truths to reach oneness with the universe.<br/>    Chakra System Revamp: Christos Gurd has retooled the Chakra system and made it a lot easier to implement, a lot more practice to use. If you already use the current chakra system, this one is very easy to convert over to it. There are also rewritten chakra feats and 2 chakra-based archetypes.<br/>    Investiture System: This is a sort of replacement for the magic item system in Pathfinder, but it can be used in conjunction with it too. It allows characters to &ldquo;invest&rdquo; part of their own aura/soul into items to give them magical power.<br/>    Philosophy System: This new sub-system replaces the current alignment system with philosophies (Absolutism, Nihilism, Consequentialism, Virtuism, Logicism, Machiavellianism, etc) that plays nicely with the current alignment system (so, yes, you can &ldquo;Smite Nihilism&rdquo; as an Absolutist Paladin). The system has optional interplay with the verbal duel system from Ultimate Intrigue. It&rsquo;s very easy to use and we think that it has a more depth than simple good and evil / law and chaos morality.<br/>    New Feats: This book includes class support feats, but also a slew of new &ldquo;chakra feats&rdquo;, and some thematically appropriate new feats. This includes one that grants you the ability to &ldquo;detect hostility&rdquo;, some stuff relating to past life regression, a Heal-centric feat that allows you to cure mental conditions, and an &ldquo;Opera Style&rdquo; of martial arts that allows you to &ldquo;fake it&rdquo; (you are more a stunt-man than a martial artist). We also bring back the Qinggong Feats from Dragon Tiger Ox and give them some love!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>New Base Classes:<br/><br/>    Flowmaster: An absurdist, &ldquo;drunken-master&rdquo;, improvisational martial artist. Drawing from inspirations like Jackie Chan, Voldo, Bruce Lee, and many more- the flowmaster knows how to roll with the punches! You can think of them as &ldquo;chaotic monks&rdquo;, but that doesn&rsquo;t really sum them up. They lack the supernatural powers and rather rely on their own martial philosophy and eccentricities. They are masters of improvised weapons, able to counter-strike foes with debilitating blows, and have a unique style of combat that can hurt yourself if you are unlucky or destroy your opponent quickly if you are (may the RNGs ever be in your favor...)! (d10, full BAB, 4 + Int, good Fort &amp; Ref)<br/>    Ajna: The Ajna is a psychic martial character with a powerful third eye. They are competent fighters on their own but when they allow their spirit to leave their body- they become an unstoppable astral warrior. However, they have an achilles heel. They leave their body behind, unprotected, while they do this. On top of their powerful &ldquo;projections&rdquo;, they have 6 level psychic casting, a mastery of telekinetic martial arts, limited astral projection, and unique perceptive abilities. (D8, medium BAB, 4 + Int, good Will, 6 level psychic casting)<br/>    Kashun: In this book we introduce a power source we hope to harness again in the future. This power source, &ldquo;Kashoom&rdquo; is a pervasive &ldquo;cosmic energy&rdquo;. Kashun are martial artists who can contort their body like an old TV antenna to get the best &ldquo;reception&rdquo; of this cosmic force. They strike odd, dramatic, poses and charge their kashoom energy- unleashing it in powerful and decisive ways. This class features a host of unique poses and effects that can be generated by way of those poses.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "220763": {"rpgdesigner": ["Stew Shearer"], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "poll": [], "name": "Gulgas", "rpgartist": ["Stew Shearer"], "rpgproducer": ["Marshall Lemon"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3419530.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Gorgon Breath Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Weekly Beasties"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3419530_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>An ancient and barbaric race, the Gulgas is a wicked creature whose strength is only matched by its callous disregard for life.<br/><br/>Once numbering in the thousands, the Gulgas tribes were considered a blight on the landscape.

Menacing figures lurk in darkened alleyways; desperate men with nothing to lose and the determination to take what they can from others. Mutterings abound at the local pubs, working men who can&rsquo;t even afford their daily bread wish for more and listen to radicals and anarchists preaching fire and revolution. Parentless children, called &ldquo;Street Arabs&rdquo; in the East End vernacular, pick pockets and snatch purses from those not Wiley enough to protect their meager funds. In these dangerous streets Saucy Jack, known to the papers as &ldquo;Jack the Ripper&rdquo; slew with impunity while Sherlock Holmes battled crime from petty larceny to the machinations of the mastermind Dr. James Moriarty himself. Chinese Tongs battle East End mobs for control of Opium dens and other rackets, all at the behest of their shadowy master, the Devil Doctor.<br/><br/>Meanwhile on the high seas Captain Nemo and his Submarine The Nautilus wage a one man war against British imperialism and perhaps war itself. In the skies Robur the Conqueror makes elaborate plans to rule the world with powerful airships, and who knows what secret powers lurk beneath the Earth&rsquo;s surface or watch our globe from the sandy wastes of Mars; planning the death of Humanity itself?<br/><br/>All the while, the gentry and social elite live glittering lives amongst champagne and Worth gowns, silk suits and noble titles, living lives of idleness and comfort; thinking nothing of the people beyond their glittering manors and opulent mansions. Whether the Robber Barons of the United States, the Old Nobility of Europe or the teetering monarchies of the Royal Houses themselves the world at the end of the 19th century was a time fraught with change.<br/><br/>Compounded upon this are the emergence of the self styled &ldquo;SuperMankind&rdquo;; those of the far future who have found themselves stranded in a past that is and yet isn&rsquo;t their own. Unable to return to their hone time of the 21st century, they attempt to make a place for themselves in this world alongside those Super Humans who are at home in the 19th century. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, the Invisible Man, Frankenstein&rsquo;s Monster and others. Baba Yaga haunts the barren steppes of Russia, and ancient gods of the Near East and America rouse from their millennial slumbers to again walk as gods upon the Earth.

To win the game a player has to return one follower of each colour to the safety of their specific locations.

Many adventurers are familiar with wading into combat against monsters and small groups of enemies, but this is nothing next to the glory and chaos and carnage that is true war. More than simply a change in scale, the difference between war and other combat can be profound. In a war, the characters are part of something larger than themselves, contributing to the efforts of their armies, or perhaps leading those armies themselves. The priorities of a soldier are different from those of an adventurer, and often the challenges that they face are, as well. While many characters can translate their talents as adventurers to the battlefield, one who specifically focuses on warfare and battlefield tactics will have the edge on others when it comes to true war. Each installment of Weekly Wonders: Archetypes of War provides six new war-themed archetypes for a variety of classes.<br/><br/>For this book, we focus on cavalry, mounted soldiers whose power and speed make them versatile and effective units in any military battle. Whether they are lightly-armored and trained for speed and maneuverability, harrying opposing forces on their flanks and then retreating before they can retaliate, or whether they use the raw power and momentum of their charging steeds to deliver devastating routs against enemies who are trampled underfoot, this book provides archetypes that highlight the roles of cavalry in warfare. This book contains the following archetypes.<br/><br/>    The mounted harrier, a cavalier archetype that focuses on crushing foes underhoof with devastating charges.<br/>    The wild knight, a druid archetype whose animal companion serves as a fearsome mount, carrying her into battle with incredible ferocity.<br/>    The spirit rider, a shaman archetype that trades in a traditional familiar for a more powerful animal companion, which serves as a mount and carries its rider through the spirit realm, as well as gaining special boons based on her spirit.<br/>    The pale rider, a spiritualist archetype that imitates the grim reaper, riding a phantom steed and delivering a frightful gaze to horrify her foes.<br/>    The otherworld cavalry, a summoner archetype whose eidolon not only serves as a powerful mount, but can carry him and other riders across the planes.<br/>    A bonus archetype for the warlord, from Path of War by Dreamscarred Press, the daring rider applies the same tactical gambits as other warlords to a mounted style of combat.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "220871": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Disturbance in Longsaddle", "rpgdesigner": ["Nicol\u00e1s Marcelo Vargas Mella"], "rpgproducer": ["Nicol\u00e1s Marcelo Vargas Mella"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3421419.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3421419_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>While in the town of Longsaddle after completing a simple job, you find yourself in the midst of a disturbance occurring in the usually quiet town.

The use of a magical college as a background for a character's academic study of magic allows a character to have contacts and connections within the magic community. It allows for friends and enemies formed while the character was learning.

A wealthy oligarchy has all the money, land, and power, leaving the masses to starve and struggle under the weight of oppressive debts. A bitter, partisan feud between polar opposites &ndash; liberal and conservative &ndash; finds no room for compromise. Government, once conducted with dignity and restraint, becomes a dangerous game of brinksmanship and obstructionism. The very foundations of the republic are undermined by demagogues and dictators, using civil unrest to seize power. Opponents are marginalized or made to disappear, with even murder given the veneer of legitimacy retroactively. The result is the collapse of the old order, and the establishment of new, totalitarian regime, with the populace often at the mercy of madmen and idiots, the venal and the vainglorious.<br/><br/>We are talking, of course, about the Roman Republic. OPTIMATES ET POPULARES is a political game for two players, in which players fight for the primacy and dominance of their ideology. The Populares (&quot;populists&quot;) pursue a liberal and egalitarian agenda that seeks to better the lives of the poor through measures such as land redistribution, debt relief, and welfare programs. The Optimates (or &quot;best men&quot;) aim to thwart this progress, maintaining the traditional rights and privileges of the wealthy elites. Both players seek to win elections and pass laws, and to prevent their opponents from doing the same, using every tool at their disposal - building alliances through influential Senators, buying loyalties, inciting mob violence, and proscription - state-sanctioned murder.<br/><br/>Central to the game is Political Will. Each action you take will cost you some Political Will. The more you accomplish, the more anger it incites in the opposition and its supporters - and so, each action you take also cedes Political Will to your opponent. This creates a dynamic tension in which each player must balance pursuit of his own goals against the backlash that's just around the corner. Each law you pass will also have subtle (and not-so-subtle) effects on the People of Rome and the Senate, building or eroding support for your overall platform. It's a careful balancing act - a vicious teeter-totter - a knife-fight on a tightrope.<br/><br/>"}, "220931": {"poll": [], "name": "Game of Thrones: The Iron Throne \u2013 The Wars to Come", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2017", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games"], "maxplayers": "7", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3539679_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Edge Entertainment", "Fantasy Flight Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3539679.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Negotiation"], "age": "18", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Along with ten new leaders divided between two new Houses &mdash; House Greyjoy and House Martell &mdash; The Wars to Come features everything you and your friends need to expand Game of Thrones: The Iron Throne to seven players.

There should be virtually no stopping for rules look ups. We try to keep everything you need on the character sheet.<br/><br/>Simple<br/><br/>We have used the same mechanic for almost everything, roll your 2d6, add any stat bonus, add any skill and take away any difficulty factors. If the result is 8+ then you succeed. We try and keep as much information on the character sheet as possible so you don&rsquo;t have to constantly refer to the rule book.<br/><br/>All of Time and Space<br/><br/>All weapons and armour are described in terms of their relative weights, materials and design. Where and when they are made doesn&rsquo;t really matter. A rapier is a light weapon so it is going to do 1d6 of damage, a blaster rifle is a bigger beast and does 2d6. A tripod mounted machine gun deals out 3d6. The same principles apply to armours, the idea of light through to heavy. The best high tech armour of course performs a lot better than medieval platemail even if they are both &lsquo;heavy&rsquo;.<br/><br/>With 3Deep you can just as easily play a space opera set following a homer-esque odyssey, a teenage scuby gang battling vampires or one of Arthurs knights searching for Morgana. The rules can handle all of these settings with equal easy.<br/><br/>Episodic<br/><br/>Episodic role play implies some kind of regular reset between adventures or sets of adventures. Wounds heal in hours and days, not weeks and months. 3Deep puts little emphasis on equipment lists. You rarely see characters in TV series carting huge backpacks full of equipment around with them. The plot tends to provide what is required whether it is a gadget from the bat cave or a closet full of crossbows and wooden stakes. 3Deep is also played in &lsquo;scenes&rsquo; so it is perfectly acceptable to fast forward from one location to the next without having to role play 60 days at sea or taking the metro across town. If it adds nothing to the story then those scenes end up on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>Story Arc Roleplaying<br/><br/>Adventures or episodes do not have to be totally discrete, there should be a thread that runs through them, the dastardly villains plot to take over the world or Morgana&rsquo;s attempts to subvert the kingdom of Camelot. Every character starts with a number of motivations as to why they are who they are and these get woven into the game. Over time they may resolve some or all of these story arcs and at the same time gain new ones.<br/><br/>Play with a GM and Friends or Play Solo<br/><br/>Nearly all role playing games are designed to be played with one person and the Game Master [GM] who creates the game world, creates the story hooks and plays all the other characters in the world.

Each row and column are scored separately: 2, 3, 4 or 5 adjacent symbols of the same type score 2, 3, 4, 5 points PLUS 4/5 bonus points for 4/5 symbols.<br/>Most points wins; in case of a tie, highest horizontal or vertical result wins.<br/><br/>Solo version is included.<br/><br/>"}, "220989": {"poll": [], "name": "WWE 2K14", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Xbox 360 edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3439874.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Sports - Wrestling"], "videogamefranchise": ["WWE Wrestling"], "videogamedeveloper": ["2K Games, Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["Xbox 360"], "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["2K Games, Inc."], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3439874_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>The 2014 entry in the WWE 2K series features the superstars of Smackdown and Raw.<br/><br/>"}, "220991": {"boardgamedesigner": ["John R. \"Buck\" Surdu"], "poll": [], "name": "The Quick and the Dead: Coastal Actions in WWII", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>The Quick and the Dead (Q&amp;D) is meant to replicate the sharp, short actions involving coastal forces during World War II. More specifically, this set of rules and cards is focused on the fighting between coastal forces in the Mediterranean Sea, but if the rules prove popular, expansions for the English Channel and the Pacific theater are planned. It is important to recognize, however, that these rules focus on only a part of the operation of coastal forces. Coastal actions are characterized by patrolling and stealth, usually at night, punctuated by a quick, violent engagement at close quarters, often less than 500 yards.<br/><br/>Quick and the Dead features a unique diceless and turnless system in which players delcare and play action cards as fast as they can.  This creates an unusual tunnel vision phenomenon in which players are focused on the actions of their small craft and can be surprised when an enemy comes alongside and opens fire.  Games usually last between 30 and 45 minutes, so you can play two or three in an evening.<br/><br/>PT-boat actions are generally divided into three phases. There is the stealthy approach phase in which one force lies in wait, trying to get an advantageous position on the enemy. This phase can last several hours, beginning from the time the boats leave port until (and if) contact is made with the enemy. There is the assault phase, in which the boats battle each other, typically at fewer than 200 yards, and nearly always at night. This phase usually lasts between 20 and 40 minutes. Finally, there is the aftermath. Typically one side or the other affects a disengagement and both sides head from home.<br/><br/>The Quick and the Dead focuses on the middle phase. Games last about 40 minutes. There are no turns and no chart cards. Players use cards to control the movement and firing of their boats. All the needed information is on the cards. When a player has exhausted his cards, each of his boats makes a morale check, draws more cards, and continues playing. At the end of a game, players feel exhausted, as if they've just been through a fight.<br/><br/>If you like your naval games pedantic and chart-ridden, The Quick and the Dead is not for you. If you want to feel as if you've actually been in a PT fight, these are the only rules that give you that feeling. The game plays very different than most game you've played. Some players get the hang of the fluid, no-turns system quickly. Others have difficulty. I have found that by a player's third game, they get the hang of it. Many don't like the game the first time they play, but after playing a couple more times, really enjoy it. During play tests some have suggested that I should include an optional standard-style turn sequence. While players would be free to do so, I've decided not to include a tradtional turn sequence, because then The Quick and the Dead would be just another game, and I wanted it to be unique.<br/><br/>The Quick and the Dead comes with a rulebook, the cards to play the game, scenario cards, and boat record cards for most of the German, Italian, British, and American boat types in the Mediterranean. I usually play on a 4'x6' table, but that's for a six-player game. You could certainly play on a dining room table. The basic set of cards is for that size game. The advantage of the .pdf format is that if you want to player larger games (more players) you can print another deck of cards.<br/><br/>"}, "220992": {"boardgamedesigner": ["John R. \"Buck\" Surdu"], "poll": [], "name": "Wellington Rules", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Simulation"], "yearpublished": "2002", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["LMW Works"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Napoleonic", "Wargame"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From the back cover<br/>Wellington Rules is a set of rules designed to fight tactical engagements during the Napoleonic Wars.
