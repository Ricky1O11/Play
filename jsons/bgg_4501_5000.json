They found these so delicious, that they would often spend years at a time, just sitting in their towers, hardly moving at all, enjoying this delicacy.  Now and then, they would ascend to the top of their towers, and, just for the fun of it, would spit out dice in all directions out over the surrounding lands. As a result, it wasn&rsquo;t long before they were known far and wide as the Dicemouths.<br/><br/>However, one day the rain of fried dice dried up, and the Dicemouths got extremely hungry.  But they remembered all the dice that they&rsquo;d spat out in the older, better, times.  Looking around, they found that many of them had developed into full grown dice trees, covered in fresh ripe fried dice.  But when the dicemouths tried to leave their towers to pick the dice, they found that they&rsquo;d got so fat that they couldn&rsquo;t get out through the doors.  They were trapped in their own towers.<br/><br/>But just before it was too late, one of the dicemouths, who&rsquo;d saved a few dice in his tower, had a brilliant idea.  He spat out a die, just as they had always done, but this time, as the die shot out from the tower, he kept tight hold of it, and he and his tower were dragged along behind the flying die.  In this way, he managed to reach the dice trees, picked their fruit, and passed them on to all his friends, saving the race of dicemouths.<br/><br/>Soon, all the dicemouths were able to travel this way.  And they developed a race, held every year, a dice tower race.

In other variants, players seed an otherwise blank deck with their own invented cards, which are shuffled in with blank cards to form a deck of about 60-90 cards. In this latter variant, a player may only craft a new card if he or she draws one of the blank cards during the course of play.<br/><br/>In most cases, unless countermanded or constrained by rules created during gameplay, players may play a card on themselves, on another player, or on all players. Card rules and actions may counter other cards which have already been played.<br/><br/>The game ends when the deck is exhausted. Points may be tabulated and a winner declared. In some variants, players may then lay out all of the cards face-up for the &quot;epilogue&quot;, which allows players to choose the best cards to seed the deck for the next game.

Once all tiles are placed, a turn generally consists of exchanging the positions of any two tiles.  The object is to unify all of one's own tiles into the same country (connected group).

It included 20 players on each at-that-time current (1970 season) baseball team, presented on tri-fold color charts.  The following two years, they released new editions to cover the most recent season.  For 1972, they switched to teams of 25 players each, on double-sided color charts without folds.  In 1973, The game title was changed to Pennant Race and the team roster size was reduced to 19 or 20 players per team. The team charts were replaced by individual player cards on perforated sheets, with no color coding.<br/><br/>Also in 1972, Time released a set of 16 All-Time All-Star Team Charts (in the same style as that year's edition), for each of the original American League and National League franchises, each with the 25 &quot;best&quot; players from that team's long history. In 1973, the same All-Time charts were released in a separate All-Time All-Star Baseball game.  This product was popular among tabletop managers.<br/><br/>The All-Time All-Star game was then changed to an individual card format and retitled as Superstar Baseball.  This was later transferred to Avalon Hill when they picked up the entire line of sports games from Time.  This also granted Avalon Hill the right to use the words &quot;A Sports Illustrated Game&quot; on any Avalon Hill sports product, even if it wasn't part of the original Time, Inc line of games, which led to some confusion for titles such as Baseball Strategy, Football Strategy, and Pro Golf.<br/><br/>Special dice with results ranging from 10 through 39 (often called 10-39 Dice, see How to make a set of SIBB dice -- A Tutorial) were required to play this game, and sister games in the original Sports Illustrated sports simulation line.<br/><br/>"}, "4643": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic276928.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jens-Peter Schliemann"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2002", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamepublisher": ["H.

The large box was nearly twice the area of a traditional AH box. Later the game came out in a traditional-size box.  A second edition with clarified rules was issued in 1974 with the same standard size box but thinner.<br/><br/>The rules are fairly straightforward.  The strategies are extremely deep. Stalingrad is by far the most thoroughly and deeply analyzed board war game.  Furthermore, the game preserves interest for players at a wide range of levels. Stalingrad is a good game to use to introduce players to hex-based war games.<br/><br/>Stalingrad uses a move-combat sequence, alternating between players.  There is limited advance  (one square) or retreat (two squares) after combat.  Units have one-square thick zones of control; movement directly from one square in the zone of control of a unit into an adjoining square of the zone of control of the same unit is not allowed.  Functional terrain includes swamp (one square per turn movement), mountains (one square per turn movement, defenders are doubled), major cities (defenders doubled), rivers (defenders behind rivers are doubled if attacked only across the river), railroads (ten square movement bonus, must be taken all at once), lakes (impassible).  Weather is good in summer, snow in winter, and governed by a table in the spring and fall.  Mud halves ground movement.  Snow halves ground and rail movement, and freezes (converts to clear terrain) some swamps, rivers, lakes, and oceans.  Combat is mandatory between units that are adjacent at the end of each turn, but the attacker chooses which units attack which other units, so long as all adjacent units are in some battle.  The classical Avalon Hill D6 table, with results such as D Elim, A Elim, etc is in use.  Germans have limited replacements; Russian replacement rates escalate as the game goes on.  The objective is to capture the opposition's key cities (for the Russians, Leningrad, Moscow, Stalingrad) or to destroy the other side's army.  The Russian (implicit in rules) can also win by taking Helsinki, Warsaw, and Bucharest, and holding them for two complete turns, but I have never heard of this being done between normal players.<br/><br/>Several extremely bad German strategic plans are in wide use.<br/><br/>Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 2<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Avalon Hill First Edition (with trays)", "First edition, Big box", "Second edition"], "name": "Stalingrad", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "5.88211", "usersrated": "380", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Russia"]}, "4652": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "1.5", "poll": [], "name": "Drug Attack", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Role Playing"], "yearpublished": "1971", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic15064_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Dynamic Games / Dynamic Design Industries", "Technicon Medical Information Systems Corporation"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic15064.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Dynamic First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Medical"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Drug Attack<br/>Springboard to Family Communications<br/>An informative game on drug abuse<br/><br/>Something unseen is happening in your community now!

Knock your opponents dice out of play in the basic game, or develop unique combinations to expel dicers to the dungeon in the advanced game. For ages 5 years and over.&quot;<br/><br/>The dicers game is played with collectible dice. These have 5 clear sides, with a figure representing the character inside of the dice. The sixth side is solid, and shows the name of the die, its &quot;casting number&quot;, its special ability, and its affiliations. The clear sides are numbered from 1 to 5, while the solid face is the '6'. Each die represents a character or item from the Harry Potter stories.<br/><br/>The starter set includes 6 dice; Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Draco Malfoy, Severus Snape, Hagrid, and the Sorting Hat. It also includes a sheet of rules.<br/>The rules actually have 3 levels of play described in them. The basic game only uses the casting numbers on the dice. The Intermediate game adds in the abilities of the dice, and different areas of play, and the advanced game adds in the affiliations of the dice, and reserve abilities.<br/><br/>In the basic game, players set out the six dice and each take turns picking one to determine which dice they will use. Players then roll to see who goes first (the &quot;Challenger&quot;).<br/>The challenger picks one die, and then the defender picks on of their dice.<br/>The challenger may roll the die a number of times up to its Casting number, looking for as high a roll as possible. Only the last roll made counts, even if it is lower than a previous roll.<br/>The defender does the same with his or her die.<br/>The lower roll is expelled (removed from play) and the winner becomes the new challenger. This is repeated until only one player has dice left.<br/><br/>In the Intermediate game, there are three areas of play. All dice begin in the Field. A losing die is placed in the dungeon, where it cannot be used. A winning die is placed in the Keep. Dice in the keep cannot be used until a player has no dice left in the field, at which point all of the dice in that player's Keep are moved into the Field. The winning die can choose to either expel the losing die to the dungeon, or to just place it in the Keep and activate the special ability of the winning die. One side of the rules lists the different special abilities. A few examples include:<br/>Capture, which lets you take the enemy die and use its special powers as well as your own.<br/>Summon, which lets you retrieve a die that has been placed in the dungeon.<br/>Swap, which lets you trade the locations of two of a player's dice.<br/>The game ends when one player's dice are all in the dungeon or captured.<br/><br/>In the Advanced game, you can use the affiliations on the dice. The affiliations include the four houses, creatures, and wizards. For every die with the same affiliation as your chosen die in your Field, your die gains +1 to its casting number. This level of the game also adds reserve abilities. These are special powers that, when activated, have no immediate effect but allow the die to be set aside in 'Reserve' and activated later.<br/><br/>Extra dice are sold as single dice. The die you are buying is clearly displayed on the outside of the packaging.<br/><br/>The packaging stated that there were &quot;54 characters to collect&quot; but only 36 were released.<br/><br/>There were two 'Starter Packs' with 6 dice each and 24 individual dicers.<br/><br/>"}, "4670": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Proclaim!", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2002", "usersrated": "10", "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic120529_t.jpg", "average": "6.8", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Lunch Table Inc."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic120529.jpg", "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Party Game", "Word Game"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Players take turns giving clues to their fellow participants.

The more people that guess the correct Proclaim! word, the fewer points that are awarded to each person, so clues must be clever enough to lead players to different possible answers to maximize their score. Creative, tricky ambiguity is the key to the game. Both the clue giver and guessing players have additional opportunities for extra points. For example, if a guessing player is certain they know the Proclaim! word, they yell &ldquo;Proclaim!&rdquo;, and roll the dice to determine the number of points to move forward for a correct guess, or backward for an incorrect guess. Also, the clue giver earns a &quot;unique&quot; bonus if the guessing players each give a different answer.

Meanwhile, the Knights guard the PIEDESTAL and try to remove the Pawns from the game before they can reach the PIEDESTAL.<br/><br/>The Pawns win the game if five of them reach the PIEDESTAL, otherwise the Knights win.<br/><br/>SETUP: The twelve Pawns are placed three to a corner on the three lowest level spaces in each corner. The eight Knights are placed next to the PIEDESTAL, on all eight of the second-highest spaces on the board.<br/><br/>MOVE: A Pawn can move to a space on the next higher level directly beside it. Or it can move any number of spaces around the same level, unless blocked by another Pawn or Knight. The Knights can move the same way, with the additional advantage of moving either to a lower or higher level.<br/><br/>CAPTURING: During his turn, if a player is able to capture an opponent's piece, he must do so instead of making an ordinary move. To make a capture, the player moves his piece onto his opponent's space, and removes the opponent's piece from the board. A Pawn is able to capture a knight only if the Knight is one level higher than the Pawn, and directly beside the Pawn. A Knight is able to capture a Pawn only if the two pieces are on the same level, and directly beside one another.

Originally released in limited quantities by Ragnar Brothers of the UK, Angola quickly became a rare and highly sought after game of almost cult status. Why? Angola features a number of innovative game systems that keep players guessing, create plenty of tension, and reward the right balance of boldness and caution. MMP is now updating this classic with the fabulous graphics of the IGS line of games and bringing it to a wider audiences.<br/><br/>The map is divided into areas, and units represent military formations and also special weapons, such as artillery, rockets, tanks, and airplanes. A unique command and activation system has players committing in secret to the order in which they will activate a limited number of their units for the turn. The players then take turns activating their units in the determined order. The result is like a tense game of poker, with players trying to analyze the map and out guess their enemies.<br/><br/>The game is finely balanced, and all players frequently feel as if they are simultaneously on the verge of victory or defeat thanks to an ingenious victory point system that rewards good play for both sides and allows players to absorb reversals and strike back with the right countermove.<br/><br/>Angola contains:<br/>    2 decks of cards (110 total)<br/>    32 page full-color rulebook<br/>    2 player aid cards<br/>    22&quot; by 34&quot; inch map <br/>    3 countersheets <br/>    4 six-sided dice<br/><br/>Developer: Adam Starkweather<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Multi-Man Publishing edition", "Ragnar Brothers First English Edition"], "average": "7.98841", "name": "Angola", "playingtime": "480", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Partnerships", "Secret Unit Deployment"], "age": "0", "usersrated": "328", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Angola"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["I've Been Diced!

It was later published by Milton Bradley as part of their &quot;Life of the Pary&quot; line in 1987.<br/><br/>Episode: Mystery of the Mislaid Egg<br/><br/>Faberge: The Man and the Egg <br/>Peter Carl Faberge was born in 1846 and died in 1920. The Russian achieved fame by designing dazzling fantasies in gold and silver, set with precious stones and further decorated with brilliant enamel work. After winning a medal at the Pan-Russian Exhibition in 1882, his work attracted the attention of the Tsar. This ultimately led to the creation of the series of Imperial Easter Eggs. Faberge's eggs were first commissioned in 1886 by Tsar Alexander III, for his wife, Maria Feodorovna. The tradition continued with Tsar Nicholas II and his wife, Alexandra.<br/><br/>The Plot: Imperial Russia is about to collapse. Members of the Pahlov family, cousins of the Tsar, are clinging to the tattered shreds of Imperial privilege. Shortly after the Peasant Circus celebration, the family's prized Imperial Faberge Easter Egg was discovered missing. The family regards the egg as a symbol of legitimacy and social status.<br/><br/>The Time: March 1917<br/><br/>The Place: Petrograd, Russia<br/><br/>The Cast:<br/><br/>Vladimir Pahlov: Head of the House of Pahlov and disgraced military leader. Vladimir led 300,000 men during the Battle of East Prussia in 1915, but couldn't find a fourth for a game of bridge when it was over. He currently courts peasant girls and designs Petrograd's defense for the impending Red invasion.<br/><br/>Natasha Pahlov: Wildly eccentric grand dame of the House of Pahlov, wife of Vladimir, and possessor of the largest shoe collection in Mother Russia. Natasha believes that the shoes vie for social position and partake in scandalous gossip. As a result, the footwear is constantly monitored and rearranged in the Imperial Shoe Chamber.<br/><br/>Lord Peter Welthrop: Natasha's half-brother and second cousin. Welthrop has lived in the House of Pahlov for the past six months. A native of London, he fled to Russia after running his father's bank into the ground. Destitute and confused, Peter spends most of his time in the Imperial Sable Yard, poking the animals with sticks and watching them bare their teeth.<br/><br/>Ludwina Pahlov: Beautiful and manipulative daughter of Vladimir and Natasha. Ludwina has persuaded the family to adhere to the practice of Khlysty (Flagellants). Flagellants believe that a person must sin and repent before he or she can become closer to God. This belief inspired the Pahlov family tradition of the Peasant Circus. This bimonthly event calls for the humiliation of invited peasant &quot;guests&quot;.<br/><br/>Grigory Yamovich: Disheveled yet hypnotic mystic. Invited home by the adoring Ludwina, Grigory became the guest who wouldn't go away. Besides indoctrinating Ludwina with the nuances of Khlysty, he ensured his &quot;usefulness&quot; within the House of Pahlov by seemingly curing sickly sables through hypnotism.<br/><br/>Zudnyet the Dung Hauler: Preferred peasant of Natasha. Zudnyet is keeper of the Imperial Compost Pile and overseer of the Imperial Beet Patch. He invariably sits beside Natasha during the Peasant Circus celebrations, clad in sable furs. Zudnyet is often summoned to Natasha's chambers for late-night discourses concerning man and God.<br/><br/>Olga Grimach: Lady-in waiting to Natasha and a woman of true inner strength. Most of Olga's time is spent as shoe organizer for Natasha's sometimes &quot;animated&quot; footwear collection. When not soothing soles, Olga writes eternally senseless poetry for a lover no one has ever seen.<br/><br/>Tatiana Mikhapolov: Sister of Vladimir and chief rival of Grigory. Tatiana is constantly trying to drive Grigory from the House of Pahlov in hopes of curbing the family's slide into a moral abyss. She poisoned his tea, dropped glowing embers in his shorts, and pushed him out a third story window-all to no avail.

It seems she became involved with some interesting characters who frequented a run-down bar in Havana called the Passion Cabana.

Rumors of a &quot;chamber of horrors&quot; on the compound have never been substantiated, however.<br/><br/>Marylin Desmond: A seemingly permanent fixture at the Cabana. Marylin is renowned for her ability to consume enormous amounts of rum. Despite the amount of time she spends at the place, this well-dressed and well-spoken woman has managed to keep almost everything about herself a secret.<br/><br/>Reggie Van Peller: The fianc&eacute; in search of his beloved Katherine. A product of all the best schools, Van Peller was exempted from military service because of a large monetary donation to a member of the local draft board.

He had just finished a two night engagement at the club before embarking on his first national tour. It was very uncool what got laid on poor Jeremy. Like, it was a stone drag. Dig. Invite some faces over to the crib, make a scene, and riff on who did the cat up.*<br/><br/><br/>    Translation within<br/><br/><br/>The Time: August 16, 1958<br/><br/>The Place: The North Beach area of San Francisco<br/><br/>Patty Farb: Department store heiress with too much money and too much time on her hands. She often gave money to struggling artists she felt showed promise. Patty had affairs with most of the performers at the club and once fell especially hard for Swain. She also gave her money to many causes and was once, for a short time, a member of the American Communist Party. She attended a party for Swain that evening and claimed she was with one of her artist friends at the time of his death.<br/><br/>Art Fez: The bongo playing comedian who opened the show for Swain and doubled as the M.C.. Fez was active in the labor movement in the late 1940's and at that time a good friend of Swain. Fez was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) While he was cleared of any &quot;wrong-doing&quot;, he was black-listed from the clubs and was playing his first gig in four years. He did attend Swain's party but left early. He stated that he was searching the streets for a restaurant that served purple gelatin at the time of Swain's death.<br/><br/>Barney Fawn: Forty year-old club owner and amateur UFO watcher. Fawn claimed to have had encounters with alien beings and believes some of the acts he hires are the next closest things. He would loan struggling artists moderate sums of money and then have them pay him back by playing his club for peanuts. He did not attend the party, choosing to remain downstairs counting the night's receipts instead.<br/><br/>Teresa Wilcox: Was Swain's live-in but was not sharing the apartment during Jeremy's current engagement. They had been having &quot;marital&quot; problems of late. Wilcox also served as Swain's back-up singer but did not perform at the Gate of Fate. She attended the party but was unclear of her whereabouts at the time of his death.<br/><br/>Rocky Tuttle: Young and aggressive loan officer of a small bank. Tuttle was making the scene often in the past few months. Although he was as square as they come, Tuttle and Swain struck up a close friendship. He did not attend the party and was vague about his movements around the time of the crime.<br/><br/>Del Finney: Swain's business manager and owner of a dry cleaning store. He was a big force behind Swain's success and was a hard working as any manager of a folk act could be. Finney was not at the party. He left right after the show to make final preparations for Swain's next date.<br/><br/>Natalie Corvus: She was a chronic club hanger-on who fancied herself a talented singer. She would invariably come on stage every amateur night and belt Gregorian chants at the top of her lungs. Natalie was often seen outside the club in Swain's company and it was well known that Teresa found that fact unbearable. Natalie was at the party but left after a boisterous argument with Wilcox about the former's singing or lack of singing talents. She claims she was star gazing at the time of death.<br/><br/>Fran Fern: Fran was the manager/bartender at the Gate of Fate. She was briefly married to Swain during the lean years. Active in many causes, she once lobbied to have the raisin declared the national fruit. She stayed in the club to clean-up and did not attend the party.<br/><br/>Game Includes:<br/>Full Plot Scenario <br/>Character Biographies<br/>Recorded Introduction<br/>24 Clues <br/>Solution<br/><br/>"}, "4752": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "An Evening of Murder: The Eternal Cruise", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "8", "boardgamemechanic": ["Role Playing"], "yearpublished": "1986", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Max Haines invites you to An Evening of Murder"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic869445_t.jpg", "average": "5.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Canada Games", "Pentalpha Game Corporation"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic869445.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Murder/Mystery"], "age": "18", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "One in the series of &quot;Max Haines Invites You To An Evening of Murder (tm)&quot; party games.

Derrick crawled into a bottle shortly after the funeral and never came out. Always looked down upon by his brother, Derrick never &quot;lived up&quot; to the Ellington name. Perhaps that is why he sought refuge in the Merchant Marines for all those years. He couldn't remember where he was the evening of the murder.<br/><br/>Cybil Admunson: Sister of the late Sara. It was common knowledge that Cybil loved Roger. A social climber, Cybil was not liked by many. At her sister's funeral she exchanged some pretty harsh words with Roger. While deciding on which college to attend next, she worked as hostess at L'Escargot. She was on duty that night.<br/><br/>Arnold Green: Boston College student working at L'Escargot for the summer. Green was not a born waiter, and was publicly humiliated by Roger on several occasions. Green served that evening.<br/><br/>Yvonne Drake: Master pastry chef at L'Escargot, she came from Paris shortly after the war. A cold &quot;foreigner&quot;, she did not mix easily with the locals. However, she was having a rather obvious affair with Steve Watson. Yvonne was in and out of the kitchen all evening.<br/><br/>Steve Watson: Young, energetic man who come from Boston in 1946. Steve was well liked and was Roger's business partner in many deals. He was president of the local Chamber of Commerce. He dined with Roger and Gastonne that evening.<br/><br/>Gastonne Schmidt: Owner and head chef of L'Escargot. Since his arrival from Paris a year and a half ago, Schmidt had become known as an arrogant yet likable eccentric. He gave the town a bit of European class, and his gruffness only added atmosphere to his establishment in the eyes of the townspeople. He dined with Roger that evening.<br/><br/>Katie LaFemme: Local party girl with the proverbial heart of gold. Having had a painful on-again-off-again affair with Roger, Katie knew of his dark disposition.

Here's your chance to enter the world of Edwardian opulence, and see what it was like to be aboard one of the most famous ships of our time!<br/><br/>It's April 14, 1912, and you've been aboard that luxury liner deemed unsinkable, the R.M.S. Tyranic, sailing from Southampton to New York on her maiden voyage. Though some call it the &quot;Ship of Dreams,&quot; you soon learned it should be called the &quot;Ship of Schemes,&quot; especially after meeting Mr. Ty Rante, President of the White Flag Line. Tonight you've been invited to join him for an exquisite dinner party, one that could prove to be as chilling as the icebergs floating around the North Atlantic this time of year. So come inside to the First Class Dining Saloon, to a dinner just sparkling with Edwardian opulence.<br/>YOUR DINNER COMPANIONS INCLUDE:<br/><br/>Captain R. Eddy Touretire, is the dashing and daring captain of the R.M.S. Tyranic. Having enjoyed a long and distinguished naval career, the maiden voyage of the Tyranic will be the last for him. He'll be sad to say goodbye to the high seas and intends to retire to a small cottage by the British shoreline. Of course, he always wears his captain's uniform.<br/><br/>The Inextinguishable Milly Beige, as she's often called, earned her nickname after surviving 5 shipwrecks, 3 train collisions, one plane crash and a bad case of lockjaw. A radiant and ravishing member of the nouveau riche, she's an American millionairess who's not afraid to spend her estranged husband's money. She's always dressed to the nines and never goes anywhere without her lucky Egyptian statuette.<br/><br/>Countess Jewel S. Auplintee is one of the loveliest and most ladylike members of the Austrian aristocracy. Dignified and delicate, she is known for the abundance of jewels she's collected since childhood. As a Countess, she keeps apprised of the affairs of state, and doesn't believe that war is coming. Of course, she wears only elaborate, jewel-encrusted fashions.<br/><br/>Thurstan &quot;Thur&quot; D. Klaas is a freewheeling, free-spirited amateur artist, who was lucky enough to win a ticket aboard the Tyranic in a last minute poker game at a pub near the docks. A man who lives from dime to dime and dollar to dollar, Thur makes his living as he goes. Ruggedly handsome, he has the muscles to prove that he's used to hard labor. He wears the only clothes he owns - corduroy pants, a high-collar shirt and a tweed jacket - unless, of course, he should happen to borrow a tuxedo for dinner.<br/><br/>Primrose &quot;Prim&quot; Ann Propper is a governess by trade and responsible for the education and upbringing of the two young Morganstine children. Pretty and particular, she is a woman of high moral standards and comes with excellent references. She boarded Tyranic against her better judgment, having endured weeks of premonitions and omens, warning her that the ship will meet with disaster. She wears either high-collared, conservative clothing, or borrows an evening gown from her employer for dinner.<br/><br/>Dr. Grayden &quot;Gray&quot; V. Deeger is a German Egyptologist, famous for his survival of King Tuff's tomb. Having unearthed more than his share of gold and lapis-laden treasures, his exploits have made him famous in his country, with the Kaiser being his number one fan. Dr. Gray is often described as an eccentric intellectual, willing to sacrifice all for his science. He usually wears a tweed suit or a tuxedo for dinner.<br/><br/>Senorita Suelita &quot;Sue&quot; Parficial is a flashy, fiery and famous Flamenco dancer, a woman of both great grace and passion. Born in Chihuahua, Mexico, her parents sent her to Europe to study dance when she was a young girl. Now she has been summoned home to Mexico by her father, a wealthy cattle baron with strong political connections. Sue always wears the latest of Paris fashions, though they tend to be more flamboyant than most.<br/><br/>Father Morrosse O'Dreary is an Irish Catholic priest, known for his sermons on the sanctity of suffering. Once considered a candidate for pope hood, he now heads a small parish in the Irish countryside, at the Church of Our Lady of Incessant Anguish. Father O'Dreary always wears his priestly collar and black clothes, and discreetly carries a whiskey flask wherever he goes.<br/><br/>Lady Mya Arstite is an enchanting and elegant member of the British aristocracy. She is famous for her exquisite balls and lavish dinner parties, and is possibly the utmost socialite of the new century. Claiming to know anyone worth knowing in all of Europe, Lady Arstite is among the growing numbers who believe that war is inevitable. She wants to take one more pleasure cruise before the shells start flying. She wears only the most up-to-date evening gowns from Paris.<br/><br/>Earl of Teetom, Erle Grey is a rich and refined member of the English upper crust, who lives on the enormous medieval estate that has been in his family for centuries. Despite his nobility, the Earl is a businessman and owns his own tea-processing and food-packaging plant. Well-mannered and quick-witted, the Earl's dinner attire is strictly white tie and tails.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "10", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "age": "18", "name": "Mysteries by Vincent: White Flag Over the Seven Seas", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Role Playing"], "average": "4.5", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Mysteries by Vincent"]}, "4784": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Test Match", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "usersrated": "58", "yearpublished": "1960", "boardgameimplementation": ["Test Match (second edition)"], "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Cricket"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1303404_t.jpg", "average": "5.95", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Crown & Andrews Ltd.", "Peter Pan Playthings"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1303404.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Crown & Andrews Australian edition", "Crown & Andrews edition 1977", "Peter Pan 60's edition", "Peter Pan second edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Sports"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "Players play out a live-action cricket game with miniatures on a felt board.

After dinner, Mr. Wirst will unveil the latest title soon-to-be published by his company: It was the Wirst of Times, It was the Best of Times. The manuscript, of course, is Mr. Wirst's own memoirs, and he promises to regale everyone with excerpts - information that some might even consider, well . . . shall we say . . . scandalous? Incriminating? Surely it will be a night to live on in the memories of all who live through it . . .<br/>Your Dinner Companions Include:<br/>P. Leigh Jerreyes is an RN by trade, and new to the world of writing. She is a budding author who has written her first book of poems entitled, &quot;Bedpans and Betadine.&quot; She's brought her manuscript with her, hoping to convince Mr. Wirst to publish it. After all, her creative writing teacher told her she was raw with talent and wide-eyed with wonder. Leigh herself modestly dismisses such praise, saying &quot;I only want to pursue one of my greatest dreams in life.&quot; She wears her nurse's uniform wherever she goes.<br/><br/>Lilla &quot;Li&quot; Belle S. Lander is a media darling whose articles have been published in every major newspaper across the country. Flashy and charismatic, Li is an award-winning journalist whose written words spark controversy and terror in even the most sedate circles. She is also hoping to sell her first book-length Washington expose': The Hussies in the House. Li often wears business suits or professional clothing.<br/><br/>Allyssa T. Fairre is easily the most successful tabloid writer in the country. Her work of tracking down Elvis-impersonating extra-terrestrials has brought her a great deal of notoriety. Suave, elegant and chic, she is known to turn up anywhere around the globe in pursuit of a story. Never married, she claims to be in search of the &quot;right rich man for a husband.&quot; Yet she rarely lacks handsome male escorts, and often wears rather revealing attire.<br/><br/>Starr Cross is the epitome of the &quot;femme fatale&quot; romance writer and her books have long topped the romance charts. Her latest titles, The Letches of Lidgefield County and Lust Knows No Bounds, have sold well over twelve million copies worldwide. Yet hers is a rags to riches story: Starr worked as a cocktail waitress before selling her first book. Her rise to the top was the equivalent of a bungi jump in reverse. In the publishing industry she is considered to be a hot property, frequently sought after by other houses and literary agencies. Starr prefers clothes with ribbons and ruffles.<br/><br/>Lowe Z. Ajante is a used car salesman turned literary agent who is sure his hard work will pay off soon. He believes in good old American free enterprise, waving his stars and stripes in the faces of pouting pessimists. He knows his attempts to constantly upgrade his stable of authors will eventually bring him fame and fortune. Lowe is a flamboyant dresser who believes polyester double-knit has taken a bad rap, and is sure it will make a comeback any day now.<br/><br/>Murray &quot;Mur&quot; DerMisteree is an internationally famous writer of mystery novels, second only to Agatha Christie. Though some say he has far surpassed the Queen of Crime, as he is critically acclaimed for the realism of his work. &quot;Makes you feel like you're right there committing the crime,&quot; says the L.A. Whines. Personally, Mr. DerMisteree has been described as a brooding intellectual, a genius in his genre. He frequently wears his hunting clothes.<br/><br/>Pickford &quot;Pick&quot; E. Publichere is a new publisher who has recently released a number of trendy titles, including - The Mother-in-Law Excuse Book: A Guide to Avoiding Holiday Hassles and Other Traumas. He has been described by Kiss Up Now magazine as a calculating, competitive entrepreneur, sure to make it big. His closest colleagues call him &quot;Pick,&quot; while the thousands of writers who receive his rejection letters each year refer to him by different names. Pick always wears business suits.<br/><br/>Ray Gene Bull is an award-winning sportswriter who enjoys traveling to remote parts of the world in search of little-known sporting events. Thus he is known in professional circles as the &quot;Mr. National Geographic&quot; of the sports world. Physically fit and ruggedly handsome, Ray is a former quarterback for Poedunck University. He is as popular with members of the opposite sex as he is with his readers. Ray prefers clothes that display sports logos.<br/><br/>Portia &quot;Por&quot; Rytere is a literary novelist whose mixed metaphors are often only understood by MENSA members, and whose analogies are so deep that one must reread her books many times to grasp the hidden meaning. Her latest seven-hundred page novel, And Then They Died, is a fictitious rendition of the mating rituals of tsetse flies, and like her other books, is published by Wirst Publishing. Por is the past president of Superior Novelists of Balderdash, or SNOB, and the ex-wife of Richard Rytere. Elegant eveningwear usually comprises her wardrobe.<br/><br/>Richard &quot;Rich&quot; Rytere is sometimes called the King of Commercialism, having capitalized on the &quot;quick read.&quot; One of Wirst Publishing's hottest authors, Rich's books have yet to miss the bestsellers lists. His latest novel, Life, Love, and Rain Falling Silently on the Mountaintop, is bound to be his greatest work yet. But fame and fortune have not changed Rich - he's still the same fun-loving guy from Philly, who prefers hot dogs to filet mignon. He owns a wide collection of flashy ties.<br/><br/>Ever wonder what it would be like to be a famous author? Here's your chance to play one for the evening! Why don't you try on fame and fortune and see what it feels like?<br/><br/>This mystery is probably the easiest ten-person mystery game to put on. Since the setting is modern day, the costumes are usually something a person finds in their closet.<br/><br/>So have fun, and while you're at it, sign a few autographs for your adoring fans!<br/><br/>"}, "4787": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic869470.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1980", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "6", "boardgamepublisher": ["Milton Bradley"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic869470_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "description": "Children's game in which players move around the board collecting Trouble Cards that randomly appear.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels Game", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "average": "1.5", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Children's Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Cartoons: Hanna-Barbera"]}, "4788": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic15736.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1978", "maxplayers": "8", "age": "10", "boardgamepublisher": ["CEJI", "Interlude", "Pressman Toy Corp."], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic15736_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Number"], "description": "Played with square tiles that have a number on each corner.

The object of the game is to flip small smooth disks (the &quot;winks&quot;) into the cup.  This is accomplished by placing a wink on a piece of felt and then pressing down on the edge of the wink with a larger disk (the &quot;tiddledy&quot;) so that the wink pops up into the air, and hopefully lands in the cup.  The highest points are awarded for winks that land in the cup, with winks landing in the target area scoring less.  Players decide ahead of time to play a set number of rounds (in which case the winner is the person with the highest score at the end of the last round), or to play until someone reaches a certain score (in which case the winner is the first person to reach or exceed that score).<br/><br/>Wikipedia notes that Joseph Assheton Fincher filed the original patent application for the game in 1888, applied for the trademark Tiddledy-Winks in 1889, and licensed John Jaques and Son as the exclusive distributors of the game. However, the intense popularity of the game prompted other publishers to churn out cheaper competitors under names like Spoof, Flipperty Flop, Jumpkins, Golfette, Maro, Flutter.

Roosevelt has started his second term and the Golden Age of Radio is in full swing. You've just spent a week in the glorious splendor of the Colorado Rockies, where the warmth of the June weather has turned the mountains into a breathtaking bouquet of wildflowers, while the pines whisper in the wind overhead. As a guest of the Lumber Lodge, you've enjoyed hiking and horseback riding, painting and pottery classes, and just sitting on the back porch reading a good book. Ah, yes, the retreat has truly renewed your spirits. What could possibly upset the sense of serenity you've come to find in this Rocky Mountain hideaway?<br/><br/>But alas, all good things must come to an end. So tonight, come join your fellow frolickers, (many of whom are famous!), for a Friday night farewell dinner. It's sure to be a celebration that will live in on the memories of all. That is, in the memories of all who live to remember . . .<br/><br/>Your Dinner Companions Include:<br/><br/>Wanda Munnie has recently resigned from the Rockettes and is on her way West to Hollywood. As a natural when it comes to acting aptitude, she's certainly destined for fame and fortune. Once in Tinsel Town, Wanda wants to wangle her way into the starring role of Hollywood's biggest movie ever: Gone with the Water. Languid, lovely and a little bit liberal, she always wears the latest of '30s fashions.<br/><br/>Sigmund Fluoride is an internationally acclaimed German doctor, famous for his innovative combination of psychoanalysis and dentistry. Best known for his &quot;edible complex,&quot; Sigmund teaches that a tooth will never change unless it really wants to. Truly loved by his patients, he goes to great lengths to make their lives more enjoyable. He wears his white doctor's jacket at all times.<br/><br/>Allison &quot;Allie&quot; Bye Riskie is a grand dame from England, world famous for such mystery novels as: The Man in the Burnt Orange Suit and, And Then There Was Nobody Left. Having amassed a great fortune as a novelist, she is often seen dripping with diamonds. She's independent, outspoken, and always in need of adventure. Though strangely enough, wherever she goes, someone turns up dead at dinner . . .<br/><br/>C.O. Pilate is most famous for having flown second in command to that famous female flyer, Sheila &quot;She&quot; S. Earbourne. An outstanding pilot as well, C.O. is magnanimous and methodical, and always dresses in pilot's attire. And while C.O. has taken a backseat to She S.'s notoriety, C.O. does have one claim to fame that even Miss Earbourne can't top - on a solo flight, C.O. saw aliens from outer space.<br/><br/>Madame Liza Lott is an exotic beauty from central Europe. Having come from a long line of gypsy fortune-tellers, Liza hopes to help humanity by revealing the future, a future she claims will never hold another World War. Often described as being mysterious and melodramatic, Liza prefers to dress in the costume of her native land.<br/><br/>Turner &quot;Turn&quot; N. Kafkaff is an Austrian author famous for his existential writings, especially his collected works known as: The Elongated Euphemisms. Most elaborate of his euphemisms is: Toast in the tummy is as good as bread in the belly, unless you happen to be dead. Never a slave to fashion, Turn tends to dress in a style all his own.<br/><br/>Hinda Berg is a daring dirigible pilot from Germany who truly believes that blimps will be the transportation of the future. That's why she's currently writing a &quot;How-to&quot; book on piloting the gigantic gasbags. Hard-working and disciplined, she's not afraid of the grunt work that goes before the glory. She prefers simple, unadorned clothing.<br/><br/>J. Ellis Mann, a columnist from a small town Kansas newspaper, is best known for his oblique obituaries. For as Ellis has often said, &quot;You're never really famous until you're dead.&quot; Ingenious and introverted, Ellis is usually described as being egotistical and eccentric. He is never seen without a cashmere cardigan and bow tie.<br/><br/>Emma Q. Wac is a doctor from New York who truly stands on the cutting edge of medical technology. A brilliant physician, Emma specializes in treating rare cases and hardly ever has a moment to herself. Famous for her bedside manner, Emma is sleek, smart, and sophisticated. She wears only designer dresses.<br/><br/>B. Iggy Mowth is a nationally loved radio show performer, who, along with his wife, stars in the B. Iggy and Windee Mowth Hour. &quot;Wise, witty and wonderful,&quot; is how Iggy is often described. For he's a man who is never too busy to frolic with his fans, especially his female fans. Iggy always wears the latest of '30s suits.<br/><br/>This mystery game is a spoof on the final fate of Amelia Earheart, though it's a much more interesting version than some of the more popular theories of the day. (She landed on an island? How boring is that?)<br/><br/>This game actually has a mystery within a mystery, and you'll enjoy the international cast of characters. Quite the convoluted bunch!<br/><br/>Also, the character of C.O. Pilate is written with the option of being played either as a female or a male character.<br/><br/>This is a mystery that makes history humorous!<br/><br/>"}, "4805": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Cindy Vincent"], "poll": [], "name": "Mysteries by Vincent: Murder on the Millennium", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "10", "boardgamemechanic": ["Role Playing"], "yearpublished": "1999", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Mysteries by Vincent"], "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic15786_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Mysteries by Vincent"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic15786.jpg", "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Murder/Mystery"], "age": "18", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "How to Host a Murder styled party game.

What an exciting time to be alive! Especially since you've been invited to attend a very special Millennium New Year's Eve dinner given by that famous entrepreneur and inventor, Millford &quot;Mill&quot; N. Iam. Yes, Mill has invented a time travel machine and will be transporting one outstanding individual from each decade of the last century to attend this extraordinary dinner. Of course, the party will be held at Mill N. Iam's historic castle of a home, in sunny Southern California. When dinner is over, all the attendees will cast their vote for the Person of the Century. It's a party you won't want to miss, a real once-in-a-lifetime event, a night to reminisce about days gone by . . . That is, for all who live to remember . . .<br/><br/>Candidates for the PERSON OF THE CENTURY include: (By Decade)<br/><br/>1900-1910, Emma Rhymere is probably the foremost poet and novelist of the last century. Born and raised in Boston, she's traveled the country by train, reading her book of poetry, Moors, Mores, and S'mores, to the uneducated masses across the Western frontier. Criticizing the gluttony of the rich, Emma is level-headed and lovely, and wears the high-collared, lace-adorned clothing of her time.<br/><br/>1910-1920, Mia Curall is easily considered the greatest scientist of the twentieth century. Having won Nobel prizes for both medicine and physics, her greatest claim to fame came when she discovered a cure for Bigpox. She's often described as being methodical and a little bit maniacal when it comes to her work, though socially, people say she has an electro-magnetic personality. She wears the latest of post-war clothing.<br/><br/>1920-1930, Rich A. Phellar, the owner of Substandard Oil, is easily the wealthiest man of the twentieth century. Having inherited his money from his father, Rich considers himself a true blueblood. Though he's hard-nosed and hard-handed when it comes to business, in social settings he's refined and respectable, a true gentleman. Of course, he wears only tails and a top hat for evening events.<br/><br/>1930-1940, Scarlett Harlot is probably the most gifted and gorgeous actress this century has ever known. The original fainting femme fatale, she has starred in such box office hits as: It's a Wonderful Wife, and The Lizard of Schnoz. Scarlett believes a good actress should be demure and sweet, a thing of beauty like a fine painting or sculpture. She wears only the most glamorous and glitziest of evening gowns.<br/><br/>1940-1950, General George S. Lapem is considered one of the greatest military minds the US Army has ever known. His amazing leadership abilities, along with his talent for combat strategy, played a huge role in the winning of World War II. Gruff, rough, and tough, the General was raised in a military family and comes from a long line of Generals. He only wears army fatiques or his uniform wherever he goes.<br/><br/>1950-1960, Eve N. Louder is probably the greatest fashion designer of the century. But she's also the founder of Eve N. Louder Cosmetics, one of the world's top-selling companies when it comes to make-up and perfume. Rich, spoiled and eccentric, Eve considers herself to be the original fashion police, claiming her only real goal is to make the world a more beautiful place. She always wears dresses of her own design.<br/><br/>1960-1970, Blaze A. G'laury is an all-American hero, one of the first men in space, circling the globe during a top-secret space mission, better known as the Neanderthal project. Originally from Oklahoma, Blaze is a big, brave, brawny and brainy guy, who grew up reading science fiction. Not only does he have the right stuff, but women everywhere refer to him as &quot;Mr. Right.&quot; Blaze wears jumpsuits wherever he goes.<br/><br/>1970-1980, Polly Esther Pance is probably the most influential journalist and activist this century has ever known. Founder of The Save the Sasquatch Society, an organization dedicated to the preservation of Big Foot, Polly has been involved in sit-ins and shutouts, march-downs and walkouts. She only wears the finest polyester clothes and never goes anywhere without a hefty slathering of blue eyeshadow.<br/><br/>1980-1990, Wylie &quot;Wy&quot; Toukay, is considered one of the greatest entrepreneurs of the century, having essentially created the personal computer industry as well as the software industry that goes along with it. With an I.Q. that tops the genius range, Wy ushered the world into the Information Age and became a ga-zillionaire in the process. Wy dresses purely for comfort, never really caring about what he wears.<br/><br/>1990-1999, US President William &quot;Willy&quot; Groper is probably one of the more colorful presidents of the century. Described as having a dichotomous disposition, he's often charismatic and calculating, charming and crafty. With his award-winning smile, Willy is a real go-getter, a man whose cause has unfortunately, caused a few improprieties. Willy only wears clothes that bare a Presidential insignia.<br/><br/>This is an especially fun game if you and your guests plan to dress in costumes! Because the character roles span the entire century, everyone will be wearing fashions from a different decade. Hence you'll have Emma Rhymere in her long skirts comparing herself to Polly Esther Pance, in a pantsuit or mini-skirt. How shocking! The true gentleman, Rich A. Phellar, will be appalled by Wy Toukay's casual attire, especially at dinner!<br/><br/>To make things even more fun, the characters from the later decades will already know the history which the characters from the earlier decades are living. Plus, the characters from the earlier part of the century will be amazed by the world of the future, the world of computers and faxes and fast cars.<br/><br/>All in all, this game has a number of interesting dimensions that will keep your guests entertained for hours!<br/><br/>"}, "4806": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Cindy Vincent"], "poll": [], "name": "Mysteries by Vincent: A Perfectly Perilous Pageant", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "10", "boardgamemechanic": ["Role Playing"], "yearpublished": "2002", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Mysteries by Vincent"], "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic159862_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Mysteries by Vincent"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic159862.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Murder/Mystery"], "age": "18", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "How to Host a Murder styled party game.

This year, Ms. Sella Konn, the reigning Ms. Rocky Mountains, is just sure she's a shoo-in. In fact, she's so sure she'll win the crown that she's planned a little pre-pageant celebration, a party that many might find presumptuous, to say the least. So put on your best pageant attire, sharpen your claws and come join the party. Then watch the sparks and accusations fly, because everyone knows, the competition at a beauty pageant can really turn ugly . . .<br/><br/>The Character Roles Include:<br/><br/>Rinah Plastee is a Ms. Medusa Pageant contestant, having recently won the title of Ms. Texas Panhandle. A waitress from Odessa, Rinah is a twice-divorced mother of three. Determined, dedicated and driven, she's sure her pageant talent of skeet shooting will wow the judges and make her a winner. She always wears her Ms. Texas Panhandle crown and sash with her elegant gowns.<br/><br/>Nathanel Parks is the dashing and adorable host and announcer for the Ms. Medusa Pageant. But he is most famous for singing the Ms. Medusa song every year when the winner is crowned. Charming, chatty, and chipper, he is a precision performer and claims to have show biz in his blood. For evening events, he wears the same tuxedo he wore when the pageant first started ten years ago.<br/><br/>Sharon Sharalyke is the reining Ms. Medusa. A native of Milwaukee, Sharon was originally crowned Ms. Urban Sprawl. She is a professional caterer and home-entertaining expert who now hosts her own cable TV show called &quot;Domestic Dazzle.&quot; Creative, confident, and capable, Sharon specializes in bringing back the abilities of bygone eras. She sews her own elegant evening gowns and never goes anywhere without her Ms. Medusa crown and sash.<br/><br/>MaeBea Shellwin is a telemarketer from Topeka. She is also a Ms. Medusa Pageant contestant, having been crowned Ms. Great Plains just months ago. Her talent of a dramatic reading from her favorite romance novel really swept the judges away. Sweet, sappy, and sentimental, MaeBea claims to be a hopeful romantic, meaning she hopes to bag the Ms. Medusa crown in order to bag a husband. She prefers soft, dainty gowns, and always wears her Ms. Great Plains crown and sash.<br/><br/>Dr. Tuck N. Liphte is one of the world's foremost plastic surgeons, sometimes called the King of the Collagen injections. With the right surgery and medical procedures, Tuck claims he can make any woman stunningly beautiful. Sociable, sophisticated and sardonic, he takes a personal interest in his patients' well-being and often makes house calls. He wears the utmost of evening fashions.<br/><br/>Taykano Priznerze is another Ms. Medusa Pageant contestant, having won the title of Ms. Continental Divide. A taxidermist by trade, she owns her own company called &quot;Stuffed with Style,&quot; whereby she specializes in decorating her subjects with sequins and rhinestones. She plans to use her stuffed animals in her ventriloquist act for the pageant's talent competition. Smart, swank, and sultry, she prefers sparkling gowns to go with her Ms. Continental Divide sash and tiara.<br/><br/>Botan Paydphor is the head judge of the Ms. Medusa pageant. As a former halfback for the Peoria Pigeons, a semi-pro football team, he feels fully qualified to be a beauty pageant judge. Slick, suave, and self-assured, Botan enjoys hobnobbing with the bevy of beauties who enter the pageant. He usually wears a tuxedo or a perfectly tailored suit.<br/><br/>Charmyn Lee Slick is a former Ms. Middle-Of-Nowhere and was crowned the first Ms. Medusa 10 years ago. Thanks to the scholarships awarded by the pageant, Charmyn earned her Ph.D. in Interstellar Communication and became a key radio astronomer for FETA. Tenacious, talented and temperamental, she recently became the fulltime Pageant Director for the Ms. Medusa Pageant. She wears flashy evening fashions, accessorized by her Ms. Medusa crown and sash.<br/><br/>Harry Medusa is the President and founder of Medusa Hair Care Incorporated, as well as the corporate sponsor and founder of the Ms. Medusa Pageant. Harry is applauded by women everywhere, both for the creation of his company's products and for considering the needs of his customers. Sincere, sensible and systematic, Harry dresses in conservative clothes.<br/><br/>Wiley Wheazle is a talent agent from Southern California. A man who flashes his thousand-watt smile as easily as he flashes his credit card, Wiley brags about being able to carry on a conversation with anyone. He constantly promotes his stable of stars, and claims to work round the clock, even while he's sleeping. Personable, persistent, and persuasive, Wiley wears only retro styles.<br/><br/>Let's face it . . . we've all been under way too much stress lately . . . And this is the game to take that stress away . . . Yes, a Perfectly Perilous Pageant is just good, wacky fun. After a night of laughing over this incredibly unusual beauty pageant, you'll forget all about the woes of the world or your work for a while. Plus, this game provides everyone with a chance to dress up for a night. The women can all wear gowns and crowns, which can be especially fun, since, let's face it, women simply don't wear crowns enough these days . . . It's perfect for holiday entertaining, especially New Year's Eve.<br/><br/>"}, "4808": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Fighter-Bomber: The Game of Mustangs and Messerschmitts", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1977", "usersrated": "8", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic15816_t.jpg", "average": "4.75", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Cadaco"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic15816.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Cadaco Edition 1977"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Aviation / Flight", "Dice", "World War II"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "(from the box)<br/><br/>&quot;A Military Strategy Game&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;A military game of logic, luck and tactics for 2 players&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Your assignment, strategist, is to shoot down your opponent's squadron before he gets yours!&quot;<br/><br/><br/>In this aerial combat game, players must move their Fighter-Bombers across to the opposite sides of the board (the 'target areas') and release their bombs in order for their planes to gain maneuverability and become Fighters.<br/><br/>The second goal is to use your Fighters and your friendly Flak to shoot enemy planes.<br/><br/>As soon as your first set of three Fighter-Bombers enters the opponent's half of the board, a further three enter the game on our side.<br/><br/>Movement is defined by three dice numbered (blank), '1' or '2' apiece, each dice defining movement for one plane.<br/><br/>Enemy planes are shot down by 'over-flying' (jumping) them.<br/><br/>At the end of their movement turn, intruding planes are also subject to 'flak bursts' (color form type markers preset by players on a replica of their half of the battlefield, and slid under the transparent cover sheet which covers the gameboard).<br/><br/>Any planes sitting on 'flak bursts' after the replica map is slipped under them are destroyed!<br/><br/>First player to succeed in shooting down his opponent's squadron of six planes wins the game!!!<br/><br/>"}, "4809": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Geoff McQueen"], "poll": [], "name": "The Bill", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1992", "usersrated": "12", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Children's Games"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic21502_t.jpg", "average": "4.875", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Holdsworth Thos & Sons"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic21502.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English UK Version"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Dice", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Spies/Secret Agents"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Based on the British TV Series &quot;The Bill&quot;.

Xactika, while of the same genre as Spades or Euchre, has more opportunity and takes a little more skill.<br/><br/>To play you must examine your hand to find cards in specific combinations that have values that are greater than your opponents. Some cards are sure bets, but only if you can take the lead. Other cards have a high probability of taking a trick, but this depends upon how the cards are played by others. So, careful attention must be paid to the moves of other players. You must also arrange to play your cards so that at the end of each hand you don't get stuck with a trick you don't want. The outcome of a hand is not determined until the end of the eight rounds, so each player must keep focused on the play throughout each of the eight hands of the game. Keep on your toes, and figure out how to take, as well as avoid taking, tricks.

Cavalry moves first and, uniquely, exerts a Zone of Control.<br/><br/>Each Province may, at any given point, be neutral or controlled by a player.  Control may be obtained by military means (by occupying all of the province&rsquo;s cities) or political.  A wide variety of events trigger an &ldquo;Influence Check&rdquo;, which can result in a change of Political Control.  The Political Control system is really the heart of the game.<br/><br/>The turn sequence consists of interlocking phases: each &ldquo;year&rdquo; contains an annual phase for collecting tribute and resolving control changes, 4 seasonal turns for building and supplying units and conducting diplomacy (etc.), and 12 campaign turns for military operations (campaigning in winter is more costly).<br/><br/>The map is printed on glossy paper; the counters are on thick cardboard but need to be cut out.<br/><br/>Overall, Empire presents some innovative game mechanics which complement its theme well.  Fans of ancient era wargames or games with a strong diplomatic element should take a look.<br/><br/>"}, "4819": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Cindy Vincent"], "poll": [], "name": "Mysteries by Vincent: A Very Domestic Demise", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "8", "boardgamemechanic": ["Role Playing"], "yearpublished": "1996", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Mysteries by Vincent"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic15906_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Mysteries by Vincent"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic15906.jpg", "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Murder/Mystery"], "age": "18", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "How to Host a Murder styled party game.

Often described as being &quot;driven,&quot; he prefers to use the word &quot;focused.&quot; For he's the kind of guy whose train only runs on one track. Meaning: He never forgets his priorities - especially his number one priority. Because he's often in the limelight with Barpha, he's always dressed so he's ready to help with any home remodeling projects, and he never goes anywhere without his tool belt.<br/><br/>Cherrie S. Ghubellee is a woman of many minds and moods, and can easily switch from being a serious businesswoman to a free-spirited artisan in the blink of an eye. She holds the title of Foods and Cooking Editor for Barpha's internationally acclaimed magazine, Existing. While always dressed as the professional, personally, she's well-liked and empathic, a natural team-player.<br/><br/>Hiram &quot;Hi&quot; K. Lesteral is a world-class tennis pro, known for his backhand as well as his passionate persona on the court. Both bold and brawny, with his professional ranking he can easily afford such emotional antics, having amassed a few US Open championships and having come so close to that most notable of all crowns - Wimbledon. Yet he does have one other claim to fame: He's Barpha DeStue's ex-husband.<br/><br/>N. Vee Ausse is a happy homemaker from Winnemucca, Nevada, and one of the winners of the Barpha DeStue Whine &amp; Dyin' Contest. Though she spends most of her time taking care of her husband and two teenage children, Vee loves to entertain and is also quite active in her community. For in her own way, she wants to make the world a better place for her children, and her children's children. She's often asked if she'll become politically active someday. But she quickly declines, saying she's not really cut out for life in the public eye, and prefers to be more of a behind the scenes kind of person.<br/><br/>Marin Nate' is a transplant from France and once billed as the top chef in the country. His credits include such items as having hosted a gourmet cooking show and writing a syndicated column. And let's not forget about his long line of specialty cookbooks, with such titles as: You Say Fricassaw, I Say Fricassee - I'm Right.&quot; Yes, Marin's name is synonymous with &quot;Mean Cuisine&quot; in this country. But after living the high-pressure, fast-paced life of a celebrity, he's decided to take things a bit easier and accepted a position on the staff of Barpha DeStue, where he can spend all his time creating culinary delights.<br/><br/>Borissa &quot;Bor&quot; D. Stiphe is a homemaker from the Hoosier state, as well as the wife of an insurance salesman, Reilly Stiphe, and the mother of their three darling children. She's also a winner of the Barpha DeStue Whine &amp; Dyin' Contest. It's such a thrill for her, considering she's a big Barpha fan.

Isone is the wonderfully talented and innovative producer of Barpha DeStue's weekly half-hour television show, Existing with Barpha DeStue. Because Tilly knows just how to coax the perfect performance out of any public personality, she's played a huge role in Barpha's success, helping to transform her name into a household word. Charming and easygoing, Tilly often dresses in the same comfortable casualness as Barpha herself. Because everyone knows, life in the television world can be very erratic. But for Tilly, there could be no other life.<br/><br/>Ray Zhor Sharpe is a traveling knife salesman who supplies Barpha with all her cooking and crafts cutlery. Having had Ms. DeStue on his client list for many years now, Ray has always been highly dependable in providing her with the finest cutlery in the business - something that's terribly important to one who has such a great need for knives as Barpha. Personally, Ray is a no-frills, old-fashioned kind of guy, who works hard to support his family.<br/><br/>This mystery is a parody on one of the great home entertaining gurus of our time, whose name we shall not mention . . .<br/><br/>In comparison, this game is written for those of you with very busy lives, who still want to do a little entertaining now and then. This mystery is one of the absolute easiest games to host!

Gentle snowflakes fall softly on New York City as the Christmas season goes into full swing. While World War II is raging across the ocean, world-renowned USO singer, Bea B. Opp, is preparing to leave for another tour through war-torn Europe. Tonight she has invited you to a private dinner party at that famous New York City hotel, the Alldorph Hysteria, where she often performs when she is stateside. After dinner, Miss Opp will debut her latest song, written by Big Band leader, Harry Lumbar. What a wonderful opportunity to see her perform before she and her troupe leave for the front lines, to nobly entertain our brave soldiers for Christmas on her upcoming USO tour. Yes, it's sure to be a night filled with glitz and glamor, as the stars come out to show their stuff. But you know what they say about stars: They always burn brightest before they die . . .<br/><br/>Your Dinner Companions Include:<br/><br/>Constance Leigh Wyning, who epitomizes the beauty and dazzle of a USO singer. Always effervescent, she gurgles with talent, motivating our boys abroad to &quot;Fight! Fight! Fight!&quot; Yet her sparkle is more than skin deep; she's a home grown girl from the Midwest, a real American sweetheart, discovered and brought to the stage by Bea B. Opp herself.<br/><br/>Tito Tellar is a man of great mystery and intrigue. Though very little is known about Tito, he's often been seen traveling across Europe, never far from the front lines. Always keeping his emotions in check, he's known to be impeccably groomed and well-dressed. Yet oddly enough, no one seems to know where he comes from, or for that matter, where he's been.<br/><br/>Major Hornswagle &quot;Horn&quot; D. Augge, is the military man in charge of Bea B. Opp's USO tour group. He's an officer who takes great pride in the way he handles his entertainers, particularly his female entertainers. Flamboyant and fun-loving, he joined the armed services when he realized a uniform is like a magnet when it comes to attracting the opposite sex.<br/><br/>Jessica &quot;Jess&quot; Abell, can easily be described with one word - patriotism, with a capital P. She would do anything to help our boys fighting overseas. First there was her stint as a factory worker, a regular Rosie the Riveter, building airplanes to wipe out the Third Reich. After retiring there, she came to work as Bea B. Opp's personal secretary, traveling with the USO tour and bringing happiness to fighting men everywhere.<br/><br/>W.A.C. Pilot Bunny &quot;Bun&quot; P. Landon, is the pilot who transports Bea B. Opp's USO troupe across the ocean and throughout Europe. It's the opportunity of a lifetime for Bun. She's wanted to fly professionally since she was a little girl, when her father, the late Colonel Girrup Landon, first took her for a spin in a biplane. Spunky, gutsy, and known to dress in either great glitz or her flying fatigues, she always personalizes her outfits with a monogram.<br/><br/>Oliver &quot;Ol&quot; W. Ashedup, is Miss Opp's agent and manager. A shrewd and charismatic businessman, without him, Bea wouldn't be where she is now. Ol is the kind of man who enjoys working hard, but likes to play just as hard. When he's not busy promoting his star, he's a happy-go-lucky, modern man of the 40s, who's not afraid to have a little fun once in a while.<br/><br/>Harry Lumbar is a world-renowned Big Band leader, one of the country's finest. His songs are heard in every dance hall in the free world, and hummed in the homes of his fans everywhere. The name Harry Lumbar can hardly be mentioned without being followed with such descriptions as &quot;brilliant&quot; or &quot;genius.&quot; Personally, Harry thrives on his stardom, especially since he worked so hard to get where he is. Cordially charming and never too busy for his public, his stints in the USO show have only made him even more popular than ever.<br/><br/>Winona &quot;Wi&quot; Bauther, is the youngest daughter of that famous Vaudeville family act, the Royal Bauthers. Grown up to be a glamorous songstress, she was a shoe-in when Bea B. Opp was gathering together a USO troupe. Sophisticated, sleek, and always the professional entertainer, she someday hopes to be as big a star as Miss Opp herself.<br/><br/>This is a fabulous mystery for those of you who love the 1940s and big band music. Because the storyline is centered around a USO troupe, playing swing music throughout the party is a must. Also, if you're looking for a party where everyone can dress up more glamorously, this is the game for you.<br/><br/>And since this game is set in December, if you like, you can even drag out your holiday decorations and set them up to add to the scene. This is especially fun in the middle of summer.<br/><br/>Ah, yes, was there ever a more romantic era than the 40s?<br/><br/>"}, "4821": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Cindy Vincent"], "poll": [], "name": "Mysteries by Vincent: High Noon on the Silver Spittoon", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "8", "boardgamemechanic": ["Role Playing"], "yearpublished": "1996", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Mysteries by Vincent"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic15912_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Mysteries by Vincent"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic15912.jpg", "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Murder/Mystery"], "age": "18", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "How to Host a Murder styled party game.

Though it's rumored that her past may not be so reputable . . .<br/><br/>Bad Billy Bob Bobbitt is a rawboned rambler, known to travel from town to town, though no one seems to know what he does for a living. And while he's as good with a gun as he is at the gambling table, word has it his picture has been seen on more than one Wanted Poster. Shifty and shady, he's usually dressed to ride the range.<br/><br/>Burgandy &quot;Bur&quot; Dello, a favorite at the local watering hole, the Sure Shot Saloon, is the Belle of the Bar and star of the cancan. Having gotten her start in San Francisco, she prefers life in the wilds of Southern Colorado. She's saucy and showy, and known throughout the West for her charms that men just can't resist.<br/><br/>Chief Lost'Um Land is an elder from the little-known Sowee tribe, formerly located high in the Southern Rockies, but now living on a desert reservation in New Mexico. Diplomatic and insightful, he's greatly respected among his own people, as well as the white men's agencies. For he often says, &quot;It's never a good day to die.&quot; And of course, he always dresses in his native attire and carries his hatchet everywhere.<br/><br/>Virginia &quot;Virgin&quot; Gnomoire, is the local school marm, having relocated to the Wild West from the civilized East, where she received her formal education. She's intelligent, articulate, and patient with her students. But beneath her prim and proper exterior, as well as her conservative clothing, she's a raging beauty.<br/><br/>S. Cooper &quot;Coop&quot; DeNuze, is also from the East. Both a newspaper writer and a novelist for 7&cent; novels, he's come to the West to capture the colorful characters that have aroused the curiosity of Easterners. Outgoing and inquisitive, Coop prides himself on getting the story that sells the copy. He always dresses professionally,and since he's been out West, he sometimes wears a combination of Eastern and Western attire.<br/><br/>Manfred &quot;Man&quot; Euell Laybore, is a hard-working, honest man whose backbreaking efforts helped build the railroad that Eli now runs. Strong and ruggedly handsome, Man is known to be up front and direct in his dealings. Yet he's widely popular with the other railroad workers and known to be a leader when it comes to labor issues.

Independent and headstrong, she first learned to shoot to put food on the table. Now as she travels the countryside with the Show, she lets no man run her life. She's considered a woman years ahead of her time and often wears pants or pantskirts.<br/><br/>See the West as it never was . . . Or at least, we hope it was never like this . . .<br/><br/>Not only does this game have some amusing and not-too-terribly-bright characters, but this game is especially fun when it comes to costume potential! When your guests arrive at your party wearing 1880s attire, you'll see a complete transformation of their personalities. This is your chance to travel back to a colorful time in history, when the West was still wild and untamed. The setting is Durango, Colorado, where an 1880s train still takes sightseers through the splendor of the Southern Rockies.<br/><br/>"}, "4822": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Cindy Vincent"], "poll": [], "name": "Mysteries by Vincent: Hard Drive Homicide", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "8", "boardgamemechanic": ["Role Playing"], "yearpublished": "1998", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Mysteries by Vincent"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic15910_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Mysteries by Vincent"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic15910.jpg", "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Murder/Mystery"], "age": "18", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "How to Host a Murder styled party game.

Snaphu, to attend an urgent late-night business meeting. The reason for the meeting remains a mystery, though the Major did mention in his email that &quot;the sparks would be flying.&quot; Could Snaphu Software have slipped from the #1 spot in the hard-core software wars? And why did the Major invite his main competitor, Bill D. Phences, CEO of MacroHard, Inc.? And what is the secret behind Snaphu Software's meteoric rise to the top anyway, especially since, prior to owning his company, Major Snaphu had been an Airforce jet jockey, and knew nothing about software? In any case, this is one meeting that's sure to be murder . . .<br/><br/>ALSO ATTENDING TONIGHT'S MEETING WILL BE:<br/><br/>Florence &quot;Flo&quot; P. Disque, the lovely and luscious Personal Administrative Assistant to Major Hugh G. Snaphu, CEO of Snaphu Software. Highly efficient and energetic, Flo is a master at anticipating the needs of her boss, aware of what he wants even before he asks. She's gung ho and outgoing, and known to be gutsy when going after a goal. And despite working in a corporate setting, as a former cosmetics salesperson, Flo prefers the most feminine of fashions.<br/><br/>Bill D. Phences, now in second place in the software wars, thanks to Major Hugh G. Snaphu's meteoric rise to the top. Yet Bill is still called the King of the Computer Software Industry, since his company, MacroHard, held the #1 position for years. With an IQ of 392, Bill is not only resourceful and rich, but known to be ruthless when it comes to the competition. He always wears a business suit and glasses.<br/><br/>Harvey &quot;Har&quot; D. Riive, a computer software engineer who graduated from MIT before he'd even acquired all his permanent teeth. A true child prodigy, he is now Snaphu Software's top technical talent, helping the company rein high above the rest. Brilliant and baby-faced, Har is far too busy to find time for fun, let alone notice the change in fashions. Thus his wardrobe tends to be slightly outdated. As an asthmatic, he carries his inhaler wherever he goes.<br/><br/>C.D. Rhomme, the wise and wondrous Head of Accounting for Snaphu Software, who is highly qualified when it comes to calculating. Born and raised in Arizona, C. D. has always had an aptitude for arithmetic. Often described as being amicable and equitable, C. D. appreciates people as well as corporate profits. When it comes to clothing, C.D. is thankful for the latest trend in &quot;Business Casual&quot; attire.<br/><br/>Margaret &quot;Mar&quot; Keating, the marvelous Director of Marketing at Snaphu Software. Pretty as well as professional, Mar is known for her niceness, and sometimes considered too naive for the hard core world of computer software. But Mar often defends herself by saying, &quot;I'm only kind until someone crosses my path. Then that's the last stupid thing they do.&quot; Mar wears nothing but business suits and professional attire.<br/><br/>Sergei &quot;Ser&quot; F. Dinette, the Director of the Shipping Department at Snaphu Software. As a former United States Postal worker, Ser thrives on efficiency. But in his job and with his work load, efficiency counts. For as far as he's concerned, the Shipping Department is the pulse of the company. Direct and determined, Ser is a big believer in honest and up-front communication. He prefers to wear military-type clothing.<br/><br/>A. Leanne Baybee, the gorgeous gal pal of Major Hugh G. Snaphu. Yet despite her striking good looks, Leanne truly subscribes to the maxim that beauty is only skin deep. Unique, extravagant and known to be an independent thinker, she might be considered unusual by the average citizen. But she hardly cares about criticism from the mediocre masses, as she lives by her own set of standards. Of course, she has an exceptional sense of fashion, one that always flatters her features.<br/><br/>S. P. Anaugge, a computer software engineer new to Snaphu Software. Dedicated and detail-oriented, S.P. is determined to make a good impression, and not afraid to work long, long hours, sometimes staying at the office late at night when no one else is around. For S.P. knows that perseverance and persistence can bring great rewards, not to mention an early retirement. Wanting to fit in with the company dress code, S.P. wears appropriate professional attire.<br/><br/>This game is the ultimate in easy entertaining! In fact, it's the kind of game where you can call a bunch of friends the day before and put the party on the next night. It's written for food delivery and the costumes only require your guests to go to their closets. Plus, two of the characters, C.D. Rhomme and S.P. Anaugge, can be played as either male or female characters, so you don't have to worry about getting an even number of men and women. Like I said, it's the absolute easiest mystery game to host!<br/><br/>And because the setting is a late-night business meeting, I suggest serving the food on paper plates and using plastic utensils. The drinks can be served in mismatched coffee cups, since people in a work environment would each have their own coffee mug. To make things even more fun, I'd also recommend hanging a few pie charts around, showing the comparison between Snaphu Software and MacroHard Software.<br/><br/>Besides all that, these are some of the funniest characters we've ever created. Flo P. Disque is cosmetically challenged, and A. Leanne Baybee is absolutely . . . well . . . you'll just have to play the game and find out!<br/><br/>"}, "4823": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Cindy Vincent"], "poll": [], "name": "Mysteries by Vincent: Lynched in Lucre Valley", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "8", "boardgamemechanic": ["Role Playing"], "yearpublished": "1997", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Mysteries by Vincent"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic15914_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Mysteries by Vincent"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic15914.jpg", "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Murder/Mystery"], "age": "18", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "How to Host a Murder styled party game.

New oil reserves have been discovered just as fast as wildcatters can set up rigs and drill. As a result, new oil and oilfield service companies have been springing up like Alberta winter wheat. One such company is Drye Holle Drilling, founded by Mr. Dryesdale &quot;Drye&quot; Holle of Lucre Valley. And tonight, you've been invited to attend the company's First Annual Safety Award Dinner, in honor of Drye Holle Drilling's remarkable safety record. And of course, the affair will be catered by the local Crude Cafe.<br/><br/>Now the real question remains: Will Drye Holle Drilling have an outstanding safety record for a second year in a row? In any case, one thing is certain, murder would definitely mar that record . . .<br/><br/>Your Dinner Companions Include:<br/><br/>Tarra &quot;Tar&quot; Sanze is a sassy secretary who mans the front lines of Drye Holle Drilling. Known for her smarts as well as her savvy, she's a tornado on the typewriter and a dervish when it comes to dictation. Pretty as well as proficient, she's had more than her share of suitors, but the oil industry remains the love of her life. She dresses to fit the occasion - pants or skirts for trips to the field and dazzling dresses for dinner.<br/><br/>Derek Hand is the dashing Drilling Manager at Drye Holle Drilling, a company Derek has worked for since he and Drye returned from the War in Europe. Hard working and an industry expert, Derek's loyalty to the company is legendary. Because he's constantly on call, he prefers to wear casual work clothes.<br/><br/>Madame Mae Kittup is an exotic beauty from the Ukraine, a gypsy woman whose psychic powers include telling the future via her magic pysankas, or Ukrainian Easter eggs. Sultry and mysterious, Madame Mae is employed by Drye Holle Drilling to locate oil reserves far beneath the Earth's surface. Yet she attributes her great gift to her grandmother, and prefers to dress in the clothing of her native land.<br/><br/>Denver Driller is a rich and rugged oilman from the States, whose business frequently brings him to Canada, where he plans to reap the rewards of the country's bountiful resources. A world traveler, he's charming and charismatic, and a favorite among the locals. He dresses to suit the occasion, with a wardrobe that ranges from designer suits to dungarees.<br/><br/>Olivia &quot;Ol&quot; Barrinesse could be described in three simple words: rich, refined and ravishing. Originally from Calgary, she's the daughter of the late Brigham Barrinesse, from whom she inherited her wealth, as well as her independent and highly profitable oil company, Brigham Oil. Ol is always dressed in the height of fashion, famous for her foreign shopping sprees and her bounty of baubles.<br/><br/>Andre P. Renure is a bold businessman who provides a valuable service to the oilfield consumer by running Lucre Valley's only general store and restaurant, the Crude Cafe. A Frenchman from Quebec, he came to the West after the War, hoping to amass a fortune from his vocational ventures. Shrewd and sophisticated, his suits are the latest of fifties fashions.<br/><br/>Beulah &quot;Beu&quot; T. Kween is a beaming beauty from the heart of bovine country, who was raised on a cattle ranch in southern Alberta. Having won more than her share of beauty contests, everyone says her future is bright, that she'll be married with a house full of kids before she can say &quot;baby boom.&quot; Flirtatious and fun-loving, she currently works as a waitress at the Crude Cafe, where she earns enough money to keep her wardrobe stocked with delectable dresses.<br/><br/>Royal T. Ohhner is an Alberta cattle rancher whose range reaches far across some big beefy underground oil reserves - oil reserves that are leased to and drilled by Drye Holle Drilling. Thus Royal often jokes about raising both crude and cattle, which have proven to be real cash cows for him. A real grass roots kind of guy, he's never been one to steer away from hard work. He wears nothing but Western attire.<br/><br/>This mystery game features a Western Canadian setting. (If you've never seen Calgary and the Canadian Rockies, then you've never really lived!) So, of course, we used some classic characters that you might find in that neck of the bush -- the Frenchman from Quebec, the Ukranian woman and her psyankas (decorated eggs), a cattle rancher and the people in the oil industry. Of course, there's also a mention of playing hockey.<br/><br/>Besides all that, it's set in the early 1950s, which provides so much opportunity for costumes, as well as setting the mood. People can dress either 1940s or 1950s style, and you can easily play music from both decades.<br/><br/>All and all, it's a fun romp, with the same lunacy and ludicrousness as the rest of our mystery games.

Your final destination? The newest playground for the rich and the ritzy, Montana's recently opened Roaring Rapids Resort! Not only will you enjoy the activities of the Resort, but you'll also be driven by motor coach to the grandest marvel of all, a sightseeing tour through the rugged beauty of Yellowstone National Park. It's all the rage! Your ticket to fun and frolic awaits you: dated June 18, 1925, when flappers were risque' and prohibition was the rule. The festivities will culminate on Saturday night with a private dinner party hosted by Rum himself. (And because you'll be dining in Rum's suite, you might find the laws of prohibition to be a little . . . shall we say . . . less restrictive?) It should be a night to remember. That is, provided everyone makes it through the night . . .<br/><br/>Your Dinner Companions Include:<br/><br/>Princess Anastasia &quot;Ann&quot; L. Retentov claims to be the only surviving descendant of that great Russian Retentov line. And because of a little-known twist of history, she is the last remaining heir to the Russian throne, daughter of Czar Frugalin Retentov I and Czarina Wautor Retentov. Having fled the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution, Ann came to America for sanctuary. As a princess, she carries herself regally, being a classic Russian beauty and dressing in the finest of fashions.<br/><br/>Dewey Kare, is a baseball legend who has redefined the game, being both a pitching phenom and a home run hitter. But being worshiped as a hero got tiresome for Dewey. So he recently retired, and has traveled to the wilds of Montana in search of a new adventure. Yet he never forgets his years in the big leagues, and always wears a baseball jersey.<br/><br/>Cassandra &quot;Cass&quot; Piajammas is a lovely &amp; luscious starlet, having recently starred in her latest film, The Monotony of Marlene. And soon she is to grace the silver screen as Valentino's leading lady. Which is no surprise, considering acting is a talent that comes quite naturally to Cass. After all, her mother always did say Cass was a little melodramatic. But she's also a thoroughly modern woman of the twenties, a real flapper. And like most flappers, she's opinionated, daring and slightly out-of-control.<br/><br/>Barry &quot;Bare&quot; Marquette is a Wall Street whiz known for his gutsy gambles and daring dealings. He loves the excitement of the market, with all the ups and downs, and the dangers as well as the chance to get rich quick. Born and raised in Chicago, he tried a number of jobs at home before finally going to New York to be near the market. And because he's much sought after by women, he dresses in the height of style, sparing no expense to look dashing and dapper.<br/><br/>Isadore &quot;Izzy&quot; A. G. Mann has often been described as a chameleon-like character, easily able to change and adapt to any situation, at any time. Thus he always dresses to fit the occasion. And because he's come to Montana on vacation and wants to relax, he doesn't care to talk about his work much - though he will admit to being employed by the government. Focused and determined, he's a hard worker, and never quits until he gets the job done right.<br/><br/>Stephanie &quot;Steph&quot; D. Rink is a prim and pretty prohibitionist, probably one of the most popular in the country. For her name is synonymous with sober. Often called Sister Steph, she's the founder of the Church of the Triple R - the Real Right Reformed. As a staunch activist and a prolific preacher, she's known to be quite vocal. And because she's always in the public eye, she's particular about her appearance, and often quick to follow the latest fashion fads.<br/><br/>Senator Vito D. Beale is a United States Senator from Illinois. A man of great power and passion, politics is in his blood, as he comes from a well-established and wealthy political family. Vito chooses his issues carefully and then fights for them to the finish. Yet he's also quite charming and cordial to the voters, and because he's got an important public image to uphold, he always dresses to the nines.<br/><br/>Mary Widdoe, is a strikingly beautiful and well-to-do young widow who just recently lost her husband. Now, wherever she goes, she carries the urn that holds the ashes of her late husband Ernie, for as she says: &quot;He made me everything I am.&quot; Her friends describe her as being wonderfully charming and a great listener. And as a grieving widow, Mary often wears black, though usually in the form of designer dresses.<br/><br/>This mystery game is especially fun for history buffs. Not only is the main storyline centered around Prohibition, but many of the characters are based (loosely) on actual historic figures. Izzy A. G. Mann, is a spoof on Izzy Einstein, one of the most famous Prohibition Agents of all. Of course, Princess Ann L. Retentov, is based somewhat on Annastasia Romanov.<br/><br/>This game also has some special features that others don't have. For instance, a few of the clues are to be hidden around the room, and this game includes an &quot;X&quot; that marks the spot, though I won't tell you where.<br/><br/>Costumes from the twenties are especially fun, as that was the era of flappers and men in wide-lapeled pinstriped suits. Also popular at the time was a train ride from Chicago to Montana, to enjoy the splendor of Yellowstone.<br/><br/>If you like history, you'll love this mystery!<br/><br/>"}, "4825": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Cindy Vincent"], "poll": [], "name": "Mysteries by Vincent: Women Only \u2013 Pushing up the Daisies", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "8", "boardgamemechanic": ["Role Playing"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Mysteries by Vincent"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic159861_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Mysteries by Vincent"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic159861.jpg", "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Murder/Mystery"], "age": "18", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "How to Host a Murder styled party game.

The Andrews Sisters and Glenn Miller are be-bopping over the wireless, and women's hemlines are just a little bit higher than they were a few years ago. Sugar and gasoline and nearly everything else is being rationed while World War II is raging in Europe and the Pacific.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, you're at home in Phunguss Flats, Florida, a town that supports the War effort and our soldiers fighting overseas. Of course, the war hasn't hindered the activities of the Phunguss Flats Garden Club. As a member, you're about to attend the monthly luncheon meeting scheduled for today. As always, it's being held in the clubhouse, just up the walk and past the Sycamore trees from the club's greenhouse. This month's special speaker will be Dr. H. Orty Kulchure, local professor of Botany, who also served as the judge for last month's rose competition. Dr. Kulchure will be speaking on the subject of &quot;Practical Pruning, or Using Those Dead Limbs for Fertilizer.&quot;<br/><br/>With the motto, &quot;Our Petals are Perpetually Open,&quot; you might say the Phunguss Flats Garden Club has a long and lascivious history, one that's fueled a lot of talk around the town.<br/><br/>For all who live to talk about it, that is . . .<br/><br/>Members of the Phunguss Flats, Florida Garden Club Are:<br/><br/>Mumsy Worde is the President of the Phunguss Flats Garden Club. With her husband currently serving in the Armed Forces overseas, Mumsy has found other activities to keep her occupied and to support the War effort. Known to be as cultured as she is charismatic, she dresses in the latest of Paris fashions.<br/><br/>Barbara &quot;Barb&quot; Wyre is the Secretary of the Garden Club, and holds office in nearly every guild, league and sorority in town. Both pretty and openly opinionated, she is married to the Mayor, the wealthiest man in Phunguss Flats. Yet despite her privilege, Barb prides herself on having perfected the art of self-sacrifice. She prefers to wear dresses with large flowered-prints and hats to match.<br/><br/>Schyla &quot;Schye&quot; Sphinstere is the Garden Club's Treasurer, as well as the town's librarian. Sweet, shy and somewhat secretive, she's an avid reader of romance novels and is still waiting for a prince on a Palomino to whisk her away. And while she's waiting for our military men to return stateside, Schye is active in the War effort, keeping the home fires hot. She wears mostly skirts and sweaters.<br/><br/>Auntie Pausto is as famous for her pasta as she is for her petunias. A first generation Italian-American, Auntie Pausto is proud of her heritage. And though she works part-time as a cook at the Phunguss Cafe, her family remains her number one priority. Lovely and lively, she prefers lace to linen, and owns an apron for every occasion.<br/><br/>Daisy Flinger is the illustrious and affluent heiress to the great Flinger Darning Machine fortune. Never married, she lives in her mansion with a multitude of cats and claims: &quot;You can never be too rich or have too many tabbies.&quot; While she wears the latest of 40s fashions, she believes she is never fully dressed until she is adorned with diamonds.<br/><br/>Sharla &quot;Shar&quot; P. Knedelz is an Army nurse who is home from the frontlines, having recently returned from the trenches of war-torn Europe. Caring, compassionate, and comely, Barb joined the Garden Club thanks to her interest in the medicinal uses of plants. Proud of her profession, she wears her nurse's uniform wherever she goes.<br/><br/>Ima Gardner is a gorgeous and glamorous movie star who calls Phunguss Flats her home whenever she's not working on her latest film. Hailed by Hollywood Today magazine as &quot;the brightest star bound to burn out before her time,&quot; she is one of the most sought-after celebrities in America. Because of her fame, she absolutely, positively, in-no-way and under-no-conditions goes anywhere without wearing her makeup, as well as the most up-to-date, eye-catching attire.<br/><br/>Sister Celeste &quot;Cel&quot; I. Bett is new to the local nunnery, run by the Sisters of Incessant Anguish. Having recently relocated from New York, Sister Cel is thoughtful and intelligent, and enjoys a wide range of interests, from science to foreign languages. Though she's an outspoken activist for peace, she rallies behind the efforts of the Allied Forces. Of course, she wears nothing but her nun's habit.<br/><br/>All right, ladies . . . do you have a bridal shower or a baby shower coming up sometime soon? Or maybe a favorite friend is about to have a birthday, or maybe you're just looking for an excuse to get together with your female friends? Then here's your chance to add tons of hilarity to your gathering.<br/><br/>Part of the irony of the game is that all the characters initially appear so prim and proper, in their hats and gloves, as they attend the Garden Club meeting. It isn't long before you learn that these ladies are anything but prim and proper! Kind of like real life, wouldn't you say?<br/><br/>Costuming is very easy -- hats and gloves and dresses or suits. In other words, everyone can pretty much just go to their closets. If you like, you can play this game as a part of a luncheon, or play it in the evening with drinks and snacks. In any case, just relax and laugh with your friends!<br/><br/>"}, "4826": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Cindy Vincent"], "poll": [], "name": "Mysteries by Vincent: Women Only \u2013 Bump-off at the Beauty Shop", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "8", "boardgamemechanic": ["Role Playing"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Mysteries by Vincent"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic159860_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Mysteries by Vincent"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic159860.jpg", "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Murder/Mystery"], "age": "18", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "How to Host a Murder styled party game.

Especially after the beauty shop relocated this year to that old Victorian house in downtown Looslypes, Louisiana, a home once owned by Miss Meara Unkinde, a woman whose deathbed promise was to haunt the beauty shop and wreak havoc on the hair of all who enter there. Plus there has also been mention of some missing jewels, a decades old mystery somehow connected to one of the Loopey Lady's best customers, Kat E. Cauldhart.

It's May, 1955 and time once again for the monthly meeting of the Liberty Library League. This meeting promises to be one you won't want to miss, with plenty of topics to talk about. First of all, Nona Tumuch, the famous author who recently released that scandalous best-seller, Paytown Placed, has finally decided to step off that high-and-mighty horse she's been riding and join the Liberty Library League. Though one must wonder, what made her finally accept an invitation and be part of a group she has spurned for so long?<br/><br/>Of course, there will also be the final dollar count from last week's Library League Bake Sale. Hopefully, with the sales of the goodies from Cooky Kuttre and Meena Ann Moody, the Library League might finally be able to afford that statue of the famous Outlaw Jose Whines, who once called Liberty his home. Oh, and speaking of Meena Ann Moody, she's let everyone know that she'll be making a big announcement at the meeting, one she claims will impact everyone's lives. Hopefully she won't be pulling any dusty skeletons from any musty closets, as no doubt, everyone's got a few secrets they'd rather remained that way . . . SECRET! In any case, as usual, the Liberty Library Leagues meets during High Tea at the Liberty Library . . . Though this may be one High Tea that sinks to a much lower level . . .<br/><br/>Also Attending the Liberty Library League Meeting Will Be:<br/><br/>Priscilla &quot;Priss&quot; E. Dings is the President of the Liberty Library League, having been elected to the position for seven years in a row. The wife of prominent attorney, Wynn G.

As an excellent example of what an upstanding citizen should be, Priss is active in many charitable causes and is always happy to help those beneath her. Priss dresses in the latest of fifties fashions, and never goes anywhere without a hat and matching gloves.<br/><br/>Nona Tumuch is one of the nation's top novelists. Her name has practically become a household word ever since she released her scandalous best-seller, Paytown Placed. Some say the book reflects the seamier side of Liberty, a side that many of the town's prominent citizens would rather keep under wraps. As an author, Nona is intelligent, outspoken, and always investigating the latest story. She wears suits of subtle colors, with a hat and gloves to match.<br/><br/>Hope Leslie Devoted is the Fan Club President for that most sensational of all singers, America's #1 heartthrob himself, Bobby Daring. What an honor for any woman! Hope takes her presidential duties seriously, and is instantly offended if someone speaks badly about Bobby. Dreamy, dramatic and determined, Hope spends a lot of time at the library, reading all the latest &quot;Bobby Babble&quot; in the magazines. She wears skirts and sweaters, and usually ties a scarf around her neck.<br/><br/>Garnett Jeuell was once elected Debutante of the Year at Liberty's annual Country Club Cotillion, an honor that landed her more marriage proposals than she could count. Now engaged to a handsome local businessman, Har D. Wirkenslob, Garnett spends most of her time planning the perfect wedding and shopping for the most fabulous home furnishings she can find. Sassy, showy, and sharp-witted, Garnett prefers flashy frocks and jeweled accessories.<br/><br/>Cooky Kuttre is an acutely happy homemaker, a woman who finds total fulfillment from merely meeting the needs of her man, her husband, Mete Kuttre. Like all really good housewives, Cooky is the queen of the kitchen, and just loves to spend her time concocting the latest culinary creation. She also brags about having a house where &quot;dirt dare not tread, for fear it will instantly be sucked into the vacuum bag.&quot; Active, opinionated, and organized, Cooky wears simple dresses and never goes anywhere without her apron.<br/><br/>Madame Fabra Cates is a clairvoyant who recently relocated to Liberty, after her spirit guides strongly suggested she move here. Fabra not only tells the future by reading tea leaves, but she also claims to communicate with those who have passed from this life to the next. Temperamental, thoughtful, and theatrical, Fabra prefers to wear wildly colored clothing, with lots of jewelry and a bright headscarf.<br/><br/>Gussie D. Uppe has recently returned home to Liberty, after mysteriously being away for six months. A trust-fund tot, her father owns the biggest bank in Liberty, and Gussie grew up with an abundance of riches. She is often considered the best bridge player in town, though she is also quite adept at Canasta and Charades, and many other party games. Tight-lipped, tenacious, and trustworthy, Gussie wears the latest of designer clothes, hats and gloves.<br/><br/>Luv Swept is a writer of romance novels and has recently moved to Liberty to research the tragic life and death of her long, lost twin brother, Adonis Studd. Luv hopes to write his story into one of her novels, much like her own numerous ill-fated love affairs have been the inspiration for her books thus far. Sweet, sensitive, and soft-spoken, Luv likes pastel or flowered dresses, with a hat and gloves to match.<br/><br/>"}, "4828": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic159858.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Cindy Vincent"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Mysteries by Vincent"], "maxplaytime": "180", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic159858_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Murder/Mystery"], "description": "How to Host a Murder styled party game.

All monsters move forward a die roll but if you are moving a monster that doesn't score high for you, you can waste its movement by zig-zagging or wandering into non-native terrain.  Each monster must move once per round, so even those that no one likes will get moved (and present bluffing opportunities for clever players).<br/><br/>A monster can attack once per move -- a great way to slow down a monster you don't like is to beat it unconscious.  Each monster is rated for the number of custom attack dice (marked with just 0s and 1s) they throw to find damage.  Monsters also have special powers, some active all the time and others that only kick in when a custom &quot;wacky die&quot; shows sword or shield icons.<br/><br/>The game includes reversible mapboards with different terrain patterns (brush, rock, water, etc.) to create a wide variety of maps.  Monsters move into their native terrains as if they were blank squares and get a defensive bonus as well.  Some monsters can fly, ignoring terrain except where they land.<br/><br/>The race ends when three monsters have crossed the finish line.  Everybody counts up the points listed on their secret agendas for those three monsters.  Example: the dragon, doppleganger, and hare finish in that order. My agenda says dragon 8, doppleganger 5, and hare 3 so I score 16 points; the monsters I had listed for positions 7, 6, 4, 2 and 1 didn't finish.<br/><br/>Note that this description is for the 2014 edition of the game.

One commands the northern forces, the other commands the southern forces.  It is up to you as one of the commanders to develop the strategy and make the decisions which will give you the best chance to win.  The course of the war is in your hands.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the year 1863, the Confederate and Union armies were closely balanced.  Either side could still win.  There were differences - the North had more troops while the South had better ones with more mobility.  But the decisive battles lay in the future.  Final victory would be determined by the same factors for the Union and the Confederacy alike: sufficient fighting strength in the right place at the right time, daring and clever tactics, and luck.  The players of this game must fight the same even fight.  The same skill, daring and luck are required of you, if you want to win.&quot; - Taken from games rules introduction.<br/><br/>User review: There are three types of units: infantry, cavalry, and gunboats. Infantry can move one space on land each turn. Cavalry can move up to two spaces on land each turn. Gunboats may move up to two spaces each turn and may transport infantry. Units may move orthogonally and diagonally.<br/><br/>The gameboard is an 18 x 18 grid of squares. Starting places for the units, railroads, key cities, mountains, and important waterways are denoted.<br/><br/>Players alternate taking turns with the Confederate player moving first. Combat occurs when opposing forces occupy the same space. The rules are more detailed but a larger force always defeats the smaller force. A player forces the opponent to remove units from play by capturing any of the opponent&rsquo;s key cities.<br/><br/>The player who eliminates all of the opponent&rsquo;s units or gets the opponent to surrender is the winner.<br/><br/>[27 December 2012] This game was first published in Life Magazine, volume 50 number 11, 17 March 1961.

A spokesman for the Aires family declared, &quot;The duke had developed an advanced version of his armored balloon and was in the process of testing it when the accident occurred.

The frantic activities of the harvest have drawn to a close; crops are no longer at risk to weather and calamity; the peace of winter is about to descend. It is a time of transition. In the Chinese district of Chi-Ka and in its principal city of Chi-Ka-Go, the festival is an occasion for fireworks, parades, music and gaiety. Traditionally, the Festival of the Autumn Moon is also an occasion for reflection and thanksgiving. In many households, the entire family gathers and an elaborate feast is prepared. Effigies representing Happiness, Wealth and Long Life are displayed, and some families, recalling the ancient traditions, conclude the celebration with a bonfire in which the effigies are burned, their smoke rising to the heavens to signify gratitude and respect. Two of the wealthiest families of the district, the Wu and the Hoo families, have for many generations celebrated the festival together. This year both families' leaders, their women, and a few prominent guests will meet one day in advance of the festival to enjoy an elaborate feast, drink from the ceremonial Cup of Wisdom, recite poetry and contemplate the events of the past year. Children and less prominent family members will arrive the next day, the day of the festival, for feasting, revelry and, after sunset, lighting the Fire of Gratefulness. The site of the gathering and festival celebration this year will be the Hoo summer home at Hoo Hung Wu. A small group of islands situated in the middle of the great river Mi-Si-Pi, Hoo Hung Wu is co-owned by the Hoos and Wus, but only the Hoos have occupied it. They have built several buildings on the West Isle, including their summer home, Hoo House. East Isle is not occupied, though the Hoos maintain its roads and bridges.

I have enclosed a brief biography of each guest. Watersdown Mansion is an old, elegant stone building situated in Yorkshire, England, and constructed in 1817. The original owner, Lord Balmy Farfrummit, made his fortune selling English pig iron to the French after Bonaparte's defeat in 1815. Roger Watersdown acquired the entire Farfrummit holdings in 1925 after the tragic death of Viscount Farfrummit aboard his sailing yacht, Frummit's Ferry, which foundered during a fierce storm off Falmouth Harbor. Sir Roger, as you may know, is the principal shareholder of the giant conglomerate Watersdown Beverages Ltd., and known far and wide as a jovial host. Female guests are cautioned that Sir Roger, after consumption of his customary evening cocktails, tends to become something of a leech. I welcome you on behalf of Sir Roger and the entire Watersdown Mansion household, and I hope your stay will be a pleasant one.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS<br/>Dr. Malcom K.T. Praktiss, Miranda T.

Faxe, the eccentric entrepreneur and amateur archaeologist, sails this month for ancient Mesopotamia in search of human fossils and in the hope of proving the Darwinian Theory of Evolution. Faxe has chosen a region of the Tigris-Euphrates Valley known since ancient times as Vages for the site of his expedition. This area is distinguished by an immense and prominent boulder that can be seen for miles and is known locally as the Rock of Vages. A small cleft, or opening, at the base of the rock is the site of an unusual collection of fossils. The cleft, discovered in 1854 by French archaeologist, Henri Formie, is described in scientific literature as Rock of Vages, Cleft Formie. By arrangement with the local government, Faxe and his entourage will establish an extensive camp in an abandoned military fort near the archaeological site and overlooking the Tigris River.<br/><br/>Faxe advises, &quot;We are endeavoring to locate evidence in fossil form of the existence of an ancient human or near-human ancestor. I have spared no expense to see that my staff and guests are provided with the most modern of equipment necessary for their research and the essentials necessary for their comfort.&quot;<br/><br/>Purveyors of goods to the expedition advise that no less than fifty cases of fine wines and champagnes will accompany Faxe along with appropriate linen, silver and china, tables, chairs, canopies and tents, as well as a quantity of armaments for hunting and defense against bands of brigands which are known to roam the area. A domestic staff of thirty will be on hand, as well as an archaeological research team of seven.<br/><br/>The expedition, by arrangement with the Turkish government, will occupy an old fortress situated near the site of the dig. The fort, unused by the present government but once a key military post, is called Fort Ap Aachih.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS<br/>Terra Sunder, Major General E. B. Sawtedd, Lester A. Fayre, Lady Melissa N.

By the end of the century, the American &ldquo;Yellow Press&rdquo; had made attempts by Cuban revolutionaries to overthrow Spanish colonial rule a leading news story. American public opinion demanded that Spain grant independence to Cuba.<br/><br/>When the U.S. battleship Maine mysteriously exploded in Havana harbor, President McKinley could no longer resist the tide of public sentiment. The U.S. government demanded that Spain withdraw from Cuba, and the U.S. Navy initiated a blockade of Cuban ports on 21 April 1898.<br/><br/>For the sake of honor, Spain declared war on 23 April and dispatched an ill-equipped and completely outclassed fleet to the Caribbean. In two smashing naval victories the U.S. Navy defeated the Spanish fleets in the Philippines and the Caribbean. The U.S. Army seized Santiago de Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Manila.<br/><br/>The fighting ended in less than four months, but the diplomats needed eight more to reach a peace agreement. The Spanish Cortes, unable to accept either its loss of Great Power status or that of Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines, rejected the treaty. The Queen Regent overruled their action to prevent further consequences. The &ldquo;Disaster of &rsquo;98&rdquo; crushed Spanish national pride and helped undermine Spanish democracy and constitutionalism.<br/><br/>For quite different reasons the U.S. people and government were divided over the treaty. They questioned annexing Puerto Rico and the Philippines. Many did not want to give up their isolationism. The war served notice that the U.S. was now a Great Power. The twentieth century would become one of American world influence.<br/><br/>1898: The Spanish American War includes 22 scenarios. Of these, 15 are playable with the game pieces and maps provided in the game. The other seven require one or more pieces from other Great War at Sea titles. Two campaign scenarios allow players to play out the entire war at sea.<br/><br/>The operational map covers the area around Cuba and Puerto Rico where the war&rsquo;s most important campaign took place.

After decades of steady progress, Japan began its own practice of colonialism, defeating China in 1894. As the Japanese began to infiltrate the semi-independent Kingdom of Korea, they ran into Russian agents doing the same. Despite Japanese offers to negotiate, the Russian Tsar Nicholas II was set on war.<br/><br/>Great War at Sea: 1904-1905, The Russo-Japanese War covers the naval side of this turn-of-the-century conflict, which opened with a Japanese surprise attack on the Russian Pacific Fleet&rsquo;s base at Port Arthur in northern China. There are 19 scenarios, or game situations, provided, including the climactic Battle of Tsushima. There&rsquo;s also a campaign game, in which players can &ldquo;game&rdquo; the entire naval war.<br/><br/>The Russian fleet is a mixed bag of modern battleships and ancient ironclads better suited for a museum. The Pacific Fleet that begins the game in the Far East has modern ships stationed at Port Arthur and a cruiser squadron in Vladivostok. Between them lies Korea, occupied by Japan. The Russian strategic situation is difficult.<br/><br/>The Japanese have a better fleet; though not as large, their armored cruisers outclass their Russian counterparts and their torpedo boats are more numerous and more effective. They are also better-led after the death of the Russian Admiral Makarov.<br/><br/>The map covers the Japanese home islands and the seas around them. As with other games in the series, it&rsquo;s divided into zones approximately 31 nautical miles across. Fleets attempt to locate one another on this map. When contact is made, play moves to a tactical map where ships manuever and fight. There are special overlays for Port Arthur and Chemulpo, so players can use the actual terrain of these key coastal zones.<br/><br/>The original 1999 game included:<br/><br/>210 Counters<br/>    One 25&quot;x30&quot; strategic map<br/>    One 25&quot;x25&quot; tactical map<br/>    16 page Rulebook<br/>    12 page Scenario book<br/><br/>The game is being re-implemented in 2013 as Great War at Sea: Russo-Japanese War with a revised map, updated counters, new scenario book and new box.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "6.67298", "name": "Great War at Sea: 1904-1905, The Russo-Japanese War", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["8781"], "usersrated": "124", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Japan", "Great War at Sea"]}, "4917": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic755874.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Great War at Sea: Black Waters"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Michael Bennighof"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1999", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": ["Avalanche Press Ltd."], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic755874_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Nautical", "Wargame"], "description": "The Great War at Sea series hypothetical game that supposes that the Germans won WW1 and confronts the US navy in the Caribbean Sea.The game is based on actual US navy plans.Players plot their task forces moves on the strategic map and when contact is made combat is fought on the tactical map.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "6.83529", "name": "Great War at Sea: U.S. Navy Plan Black", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["13405", "8781"], "usersrated": "68", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Great War at Sea"]}, "4918": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic316884.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Michael Bennighof"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1998", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": ["Avalanche Press Ltd.", "Kokusai-Tsushin Co., Ltd.

The theme of the game is the migration of people down the Indonesian archipelago into New Guinea and Australia. The games is based on a set of 136 laser cut wooden jigsaw like tiles which go together in a multitude of ways to form a set of islands.<br/><br/>The game starts with all of the tiles face up on the playing surface and one tile in a cleared space in the center of the playing surface to start play. Players select a tile from the pool of upturned tiles and try to join tiles to it to extend the islands of an archipelago, 'discovering' a different set of islands each time they play the game. Each player has a number of tokens for his clan or totem. The aim of the game is to claim nodes (points on the land of the islands where the corners of a number of tiles come together). The player who places the last tile at a node may claim that node for his clan. If an island is completed then all of the tokens on the island double in value. There is therefore an incentive for players who have tokens on an island to cooperate to complete the island, but of course each is trying to get more out of the cooperation than the others. The game ends when one player has used all of his tokens or when no further tiles can be placed, or when the players agree to finish.<br/><br/>The game can be played either as a race game with all players working simultaneously or as a turns based game. The race game takes about 30-45 minutes to play, while the turns based games takes 60-90 minutes to play. There are a number of optional game elements that can be added once players are comfortable with the basic game: fresh water rights (for water surrounded by land), tribes (clan tokens in a tribe are worth more than on their own), challenges (where a player can try to convert a token to their clan), and resources (owned by the player with the most tokens on the island at the end of the game). Some of these game elements result in a more cooperative styled game while some result in more conflict. Players can mix and match the game elements to produce a style of game that suits their mood or style of play.<br/><br/>The publisher's website <a target='_blank' href='http://sagacity.aires.com.au' rel='nofollow'>http://sagacity.aires.com.au</a> formerly had more information but appears to be defunct as of mid-2010.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "average": "6.01775", "name": "Sunda to Sahul", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Tile Placement"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "291", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games", "Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Asian Theme", "Tropical theme"]}, "4962": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic263716.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jim Dunnigan"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1968", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamepublisher": ["The Avalon Hill Game Co"], "maxplaytime": "360", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic263716_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "360", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War I"], "description": "1914 is a traditional hex and counter wargame that attempts to simulate the opening phases of WW I on the Western Front.  This was James Dunnigan&rsquo;s second game for Avalon Hill. Like many wargames combat is resolved through the use of dice and a Combat results table (CRT).<br/><br/>The players accumulate victory points by occupying 24 key areas at the game end as well as points for enemy units destroyed.  The Eastern Front with Russia is abstracted and the German player may receive victory points for deploying part of his initial forces there, and will lose points for invading Belgium, Luxembourg or Holland.  The player who most effectively wears down his opponent and holds geographical objectives will win the game.<br/><br/>This game is particularly complex in comparison to other Avalon Hill games at the time.  Not only does it have a 34 page rulebook, use unit facing, supply line limitations, and a CRT,  there are also multiple options for fog of war (counters turned upside down or dummy counters), and step losses for units.   There is a short and long version of the game as well as cards for several variants.  Several options such as simultaneous movement and delayed commands require a third player as a referee.  The long version of the game may take multiple sittings to accomplish.<br/><br/>While not an easy 'game' to play, 1914 is a rewarding simulation both innovative for its day and enjoyable to play. While this game is very different from other games from the period and has a couple of faintly tedious mechanics it is worth the effort and can be quite exciting to play. By today's standards we would like to see forced march and some command hurtles for the over extended Germans but one could say something similar about most old games.  This game does not allow players to ramp up a decided combat advantage from a god's eye point of view. No individual combat is decisive and one can only manage this not overcome it.

It preceded the later, more popular boardgames (Mutant Chronicles: Siege of the Citadel and Fury of the Clansmen) and the English release of the roleplaying game on which it was based. Blood Berets is only slightly more complex than Siege of the Citadel and Fury of the Clansmen because it is really not much more than a streamlined version of the roleplaying game's combat system.<br/><br/>This game included many of the rules of popular wargames, including a chit-based initiative system, cover, hidden deployment, and model facing.  It too used Target Games's one hit, one armor roll system (with a d20) for fast action.  This game was distinguished by a card for each character.  When the character was hit once (or twice, for the Nepharites), the card was turned over, revealing an injured portrait and lower stats for the injured character.  When the character was hurt twice (or four times, for the Nepharites), it died. The game is enjoyable, but since it has only three mission scenarios, it does not lend itself to much variation upon repeat plays.  The human player is aware of the general location of mutants through the use of his &quot;scanner&quot; - which is counters placed on various tiles (revealed when a tile is overturned and replaced with the appropriate miniature).  Even so, the game is an enjoyable introduction to the roleplaying game and is very adaptable for those gamers who like to tinker with rules systems to develop their own variants. The subsequent development of Warzone as a tabletop miniatures wargame added a large number of metal miniatures that could be used in variants of the game.<br/><br/>Probably the most innovative part of the game (for its time) was the inclusion of 18 plastic miniatures for playing the game, each in its own foam compartment neatly stored in the bottom of the box. Six Blood Berets were included (1 Sgt., 1 Medic, and 4 Grunts), 10 Undead Legionnaires, and 2 Nepharites (bad guy leaders). Heartbreaker produced a limited line of miniatures suitable for use with Blood Berets shortly after the game was released. These miniatures were lead and featured the Bauhaus Rangers with the Deathlockdrum machine gunner and Sgt. with 4 Grunts. There were also lead minis of Nepharites and Undead Legionnaires.<br/><br/>A rare poster-magazine called &quot;Sinkadus&quot; 39 &amp; 40 that was produced by Target Games AB only in Sweden, added an expansion to Blood Berets.

This is not a complete game; players are required to independantly purchase miniatures and construct a playing surface (wargames terrain). The game is scaled for 10mm miniatures (1:144, N Scale), and is designed to represent combat at the regiment and brigade level set in a fantasy/renaissance techology world.<br/><br/>In Warmaster, combat and casualty calculations occur at the stand level. That is, for every stand in a unit, a number of dice are rolled in combat. As whole stands are removed by sustaining casualties, the number of dice similalry decreases.<br/><br/>The command mechanism in Warmaster is simple but evocative. Each leader model has a Command factor. To issue a command, such as 'move forward' to a unit, two dice must be rolled against that target command factor. For every subsequent order attempted the target number becomes more difficult to achieve. As a consequence, despite being on the surface a move-counter move system, the turns are variable length and each player may not have the full opportunity to achieve everything they may want to. This simple mechanism introduces enjoyable tension into what is otherwise a largely conventional set of wargame rules.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Warmaster Annual 2002<br/>    Warmaster Annual 2003<br/>    Warmaster Armies<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Warmaster Ancients<br/>    The Battle of Five Armies<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "name": "Warmaster", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Variable Player Powers"], "average": "7.06902", "boardgameexpansion": ["40250"], "usersrated": "407", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games", "Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Warhammer Fantasy Wargames"]}, "4986": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Ed Konstant"], "poll": [], "name": "Elementary Watson", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Memory", "Storytelling"], "yearpublished": "1978", "usersrated": "8", "maxplayers": "7", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic29848_t.jpg", "average": "5.875", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Phoenix Games (I)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic29848.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Phoenix First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Memory", "Murder/Mystery", "Party Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "The perfect crime! This boxed game allows players to plan and try to solve it. No dice or other elements of chance.<br/><br/>One player (a referee) plots and writes the basics of a crime set in Victorian London. The other players (detectives) have little to work with at the start other than a description of what occurred, plus some information on the main characters. From that point on, it becomes a race against the clock since each crime must be solved within a set number of turns known only to the referee.<br/><br/>The mechanics are simple: detectives submit questions in writing to the referee. After collecting all of them, the referee answers them verbally. This means that the answers usually are understood only by the asking players. Questions must be very specific: for example, a player can check bank records only if he or she has spent part of a turn going to the bank. A mixed group of players will always have one or two ahead of the pack and one or two behind. Players also may pool information, but some always will hold back.<br/><br/>Elementary Watson is simple to play, difficult to master because it requires role-playing thinking.
