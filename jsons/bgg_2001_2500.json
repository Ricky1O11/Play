Many of the mechanics are similar to that of one of TSR's other wargames (Red Storm Rising) so players of that game can rather easily go to this game.<br/><br/>Two versions of this game are played. With less than 5 players, the game is a &quot;Basic Game&quot; where military might is what wins the game. Players take sides, usually a combination of Middle Eastern nations plus the US. In the two player version, for instance, it is (quite predictably) the US &amp; Allies vs. Iraq; in the three-player game &quot;Holy War&quot;, it's Israel vs. Iraq (and Yemen and Jordan) vs. Saudi Arabia (and Syria, Libya, and Lebanon), and so on.<br/><br/>Combat rules are rather straightforward, and wargamers will be familiar with many of the mechanics. Land (w/ infantry, Iraqi National Guard, and tanks), sea, and air units are all utilized. Most units can take a few hits before removed from the board.<br/><br/>The Gameboard is big and beautiful. It has large areas denoting the nations of the Middle East, with some abstracted land to shore up the U.A.E. and some islands. It also has oil wells and airbases, as well as some other stuff.<br/><br/>The *real* game, though, is the six-player diplomatic game. The players are now clearly defined: The US (NATO), Iran, Israel, Iraq/Yemen, Moderate Arabs (Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait, etc.), and Volatile Arabs (Jordan, Libya, etc.) This adds a crucial element of diplomacy and politics, and makes the game much more interesting than the normal wargaming stuff. A &quot;War Fever&quot; and &quot;Jihad&quot; marker change as nations do things--for instance, the first time a US unit is attacked outside of Turkey, War Fever &quot;tripwires&quot; to 10. If Israel attacks a neighbor, Jihad increases by 2. War Fever and Jihad permit certain things to happen--for instance, if War Fever gets too low, the US is restricted in whom they may attack. If Jihad hits either 1 or 10, revolutions may occur--which can switch entire nations to another player!<br/><br/>Messages can be sent to other players via a diplomatic pouch--you cannot simply pull another player to the side and whisper in their ear. All messages, once read, go into a big pouch, and players can make diplomatic gestures to read some of the messages after they're read.<br/><br/>Victory occurs, in any case, when you meet objectives, which can vary from player to player. &quot;War Aim&quot; chits are drawn before the game begins, and so players are not quite certain as to exactly what other players are going for. For Instance, Iraq may win if they capture and hold Kuwait for the last three turns; if Jihad has reached 10 at least once and 10 non-Muslim units have been destroyed (by anyone); or by controlling three more oil fields than they started with. It all depends on what they looked for.<br/><br/>All in all, the Diplomatic game changes the basic game so much that political considerations are as important as military ones.<br/><br/>A simplified version of the game with the same name appeared in the TSR comic Warhawks #3.

The game is set in the Whamite Islands.  It is a very fun game, which usually lasts an hour or so depending on the number players and chance.<br/><br/>The idea of the game is to make as much gold as possible by controlling countries within your own little empire from the dozen or so provinces available.  The game uses a card system with a lot of clever design tricks added on to provide depth.<br/><br/>The game play within your turn is easy to pick up, but requires much thought to get right. You are dealt six cards initially, which will usually give you weak control of a couple of countries. These can be added to each turn by drawing two free cards or taking the top card from the discard pile. Additionally, you can buy extra cards every turn.  Having checked the cards for events and acted on those immediately, you can make 'melds,' war and political manoeuvres before compulsorily discarding one card.<br/><br/>The heart of the game is the 'meld.' A meld is simply the act of laying one or more cards from your hand in front of you, thus activating their powers. By having the most powerful political meld on the table (determined by the total number of flags on the melded cards), you control that country until toppled by better politics or combat. Each country normally has a couple of leaders, often with low numbers, and a varying number of higher-numbered followers who might be loyal to any leader card or just one.<br/><br/>Power can be stolen in two ways: political coups where you lay more flag cards than are currently melded (you take over those cards as well - those willing rally to your cause), or by the time-honoured invasion force.<br/><br/>Combat is simple enough, but can prove a little fiddly at times. Once battle is joined, a d6 is rolled to see how many rounds the battle will last. Rolling a one when there are two large armies will virtually guarantee a non-result, whereas a six will give both sides a good chance of a win. Swords kill simply on a roll of five or six, castles get to 'fight' in defence, and defending ships must be beaten first.<br/><br/>The game has an excellent basic structure.  The key to the game is the balance of military, political power, and wealth.  It really works well.  But, as always, there are improvements to be made and rules that can be changed to improve or change the flavor of the game.  But, the reason why the game works well is that there is an excellent structure underlying the few contested rules.<br/><br/>It's worth adding that a lot of the fun comes from the irreverent humour on the cards--just in case you thought you were playing a serious strategy game.  Names are satirical, silly, or obtuse references to real world people, places or events.  For example, there's a castle named &quot;Ratlarbig&quot; (look at it closely), a character called the &quot;Sorcerer's Apprentice&quot; and a group of soldiers called &quot;The Bloody Buggers&quot;.

Because of this feature, similar to Bughouse, the game can last longer than a Chess game, the board generally stays fairly crowded and there is no simplification going into the endgame.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Aztral Games 'Western' Edition", "Elephant Chess Club English edition", "FX Schmid German edition", "The Games Gang Edition 1987", "Gentosha / Pieco Second Wood Box Edition", "Hanayama Japanese Edition", "Hanayama travel edition", "Invicta Passport Series Edition", "Ishi Press edition in green box", "Ishi Press edition in tube", "Kumon first edition", "Nekomado / Pieco edition", "Nekomado Hidetchi edition", "nestorgames edition 2016", "Nestorgames English/Japanese edition", "Nestorgames English/Japanese edition", "Nintendo Dark Blue Edition", "Origineering edition", "P\u00e0cly Japanese edition 2011", "Shogi Association British Edition", "The Shogi Association George Hodges edition", "The Shogi Association George Hodges edition", "Shogi Association Travel Edition", "Shogi.cz Multilingual edition", "SYU Creation English magnetic edition", "U3 magnetic edition no. 1514", "U3 magnetic edition no. 3814", "Yellow Mountain Imports edition"], "average": "7.26409", "name": "Shogi", "videogamebg": ["0 Kara no Shogi: Shogi Youchien Ayumi Kumi R", "Hon Shogi", "Saiky\u014d Habu Sh\u014dgi", "Shogi", "Shotest Shogi", "Tsume Shogi Hyakuban Shoubu"], "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "1114", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Chess Games", "Combinatorial", "Country: Japan", "Shogi"]}, "2066": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Andreas Steiner", "Hartmut Witt"], "average": "5.42784", "poll": [], "name": "Teufel, Teufel!", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Modular Board", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "1992", "usersrated": "37", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1328911_t.png", "boardgameartist": ["Andreas Steiner"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Hexagames (I)", "Salagames"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1328911.png", "boardgameversion": ["Salagames Edition", "Salagames English first edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Exploration"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Cards with letters in six colors, devils and towers are laid out upside down on the board.

Roberts Best Pre-Twentieth Century Game Winner"], "description": "This sprawling rendition of the American Civil War tries to fit in everything, from Grant and Lee down to Indian raids in the Western territories. It also includes the most extensive treatment of naval and riverine warfare of any strategic Civil War game. The map covers the theater of the war from the Eastern seaboard to the middle of Texas at 25 miles per hex. An optional second map extends to New Mexico. There are five turns per year, four of two months each and a four-month Winter turn. Each turn consists of an indefinite number of &quot;pulses&quot; and may last a long, long time. Troops are represented by generic Strength Points (about 5,000 men per SP, or one or two ironclads with escorting naval vessels).<br/><br/>The key concepts in the game are Theaters, Command Points, Pulses and Leaders.<br/><br/><br/>     There are three Theaters: East, West and Trans-Mississippi. Players must prioritize them each turn as primary, secondary and tertiary. These designations are made a turn in advance, requiring a modest degree of foresight. Higher priority Theaters receive larger allocations of Command Points and thus will see more activity.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Command Points are needed to perform most of the game's functions, such as moving SP's, consolidating SP's into Armies, constructing fortifications, adding naval SP's, sacking unwanted generals, etc. Players obtain them by dice rolls at the start of each turn. In addition to CP's assigned to individual theaters, they receive an allotment of &quot;discretionary&quot; CP's that can be used in any Theater. The Union also gets Naval CP's. Additional CP's may be generated during a turn, as noted below.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Each turn is divided into an indefinite number of Pulses. To begin a Pulse, each player rolls two dice. The difference between the results is the number of actions each must take in that Pulse (high roller first). Actions may be used to expend Command Points, to muster SP reinforcements or to bring inew or newly promoted Leaders into play. If the dice rolls are equal, either the turn ends immediately or each player receives additional Command Points. The likelihood of an immediate end rises with the number of tied rolls and is a certainty on the fourth tie. If the turn doesn't end in this fashion, it continues until all Command Points have been used and available reinforcements and Leaders entered.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     While Strength Points are abstract, the game includes more than 60 historical Leaders, who enter play at about the time that they rose to prominence in real life. Each Leader has a rank (one to four stars) and ratings for Initiative, Tactical Combat and Army Command. Many begin at lower ranks and can be promoted. Sherman, for instance, has a single star when he appears but can rise to four. Like Presidents Lincoln and Davis in real life, players don't have absolute control over promotions, nor does every Leader perform better at a higher rank. A Leader's rank determines the number of SP's he can command - up to two for a one star, up to six for higher ranks. Assigning as many SP's as permitted to a Leader (preferably a capable one) is economical, since he can move his entire force by expending Command Points equal to his Initiative. (Lower Initiative numbers are better in this game.) Without Leaders, SP's cost one CP each to move, rendering them all but static. Better yet are Armies, which can be as large as 25 SP's and must be commanded by a three or four star Leader. (Each Army has its own maximum size, based on its historical counterpart.)<br/><br/><br/>The game has much more: an elaborate combat resolution procedure, somewhat less elaborate supply rules, a naval system that is a game in itself, cavalry, railroads, militia, neutral states and a chrome-laden option to add the Far West map and Theater.<br/><br/>Players gain Victory Points primarily by capturing major enemy and neutral cities and winning neutral states to their side. The South also gets VP's for successful commerce raiding and for isolating or capturing Washington, D.C. It wins at once if it captures Washington at a moment when it has more VP's than the North. Otherwise, VP's are checked in November 1864 and April 1865, when the game comes to a definitive end.<br/><br/>For those who lack time or patience for the full war, scenarios are provided with the historical setups as of the start of 1862, 1863 and 1864.<br/><br/>The Civil War isn't the biggest game ever produced on that dreadful conflict, but it is certainly among the most ambitious in its scope and degree of detail.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Victory Games edition"], "name": "The Civil War", "playingtime": "1200", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Simulation"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "946", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "average": "7.67463", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["I've Been Diced! episode 28: Eric Lee Smith", "I've Been Diced! episode 66: Combat systems"]}, "2082": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic14374.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Joseph Reiser"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1990", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Ted Koller"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Victory Games (I)"], "maxplaytime": "240", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic14374_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "Shell Shock! is a two-player game of combat, adventure and heroism in World War II Europe; adapted from the award-winning and incredibly popular Ambush! solitaire game.

Only the fastest and luckiest elf is allowed to keep his gold though, so while the competition is friendly, it is also very challenging. No one seems to care that the elves try to hinder each other by hiding stones where they think their fellow competitors will dig.

It is a popular gambling game, but wagering real stakes is by no means necessary to have fun playing.<br/><br/>The tiles consist of three suits numbering 1-9 (Dots, Numbers or Characters, and Bamboo, the &quot;Ace&quot; of which almost always looks like a bird), three different dragons (Red, Green, and White [white is unusual in that it may look like a silvery dragon, or like a picture frame, or blank - think &quot;White dragon in a snowstorm&quot;), and the four winds (east, south, west, and north).  There are four copies of each tile.  This totals to 136 tiles. In addition, special Flower, Season, and Joker (American version) tiles may also be used.<br/><br/>Four players take turns drawing from a stock (the wall), or from the other players' discards, in an attempt to form sets of numeric sequences (e.g., 5-6-7 of the same suit, which can only be drawn from the player at one's left, by calling &quot;Chow&quot;), triplets and quadruplets (which can be drawn from the discards out-of-turn by calling &quot;Pung&quot;), pairs, and other patterns. &quot;Pung&quot; takes precedence over &quot;Chow&quot;, and &quot;Mah Jongg&quot; takes precedence over all (and is the only situation one may draw &quot;Chow&quot; out-of-turn.) What happens if a single discard would give two (or more!) players &quot;Mah Jongg&quot;? Precedence goes to the player who would play next in normal sequence.<br/><br/>Originating in China in the mid-19th century, it was introduced to the U.S. in the 1920s.  It is now played in different forms throughout Asia, Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand.

What makes this game different is there are two areas to fight/control and the artwork on the cards.<br/><br/>The story, Heaven has fallen and the Angels trapped on Earth are trying to use the Matrix (internet) to open a gateway into Heaven.<br/><br/>There are six basic types of cards.<br/><br/>Locations (lands) that open (tap) to provide aura (mana) or store tau (victory points.) There are 8 different convictions (colors) so from a starter it will still be near impossible to build a deck.<br/><br/>Characters (creatures) represent the fallen hosts and heathen groups that can be called. These can battle in the Wilds (real world) or plug in and leave their body and fight in the Matrix. While there, if they die they're ripped back into their body.<br/><br/>Alephs (artifacts) are powerful talismans that attach to characters or locations.<br/><br/>Enhancements (enchantments) attach to other cards for positive or negative affects.<br/><br/>Celestial Powers (sorceries) can be played on your turn only and are discarded immediately.<br/><br/>Miracles (instants) are instant effects that can be played anytime.<br/><br/>To win the game you need to play cards in the Matrix that can store tau and protect them. Each card can only hold so much, so you will need to call more then one. You will need to store enough tau (5 to 21 depending on the number of players and desired game length) to open a gateway into heaven.<br/><br/>The game is a bit more complicated than Magic but with fewer cards available not as rich. There is also a social voting element similar to V:tES/Jyhad.  Special mention must be made of the cards.

Considered mere legend by many, Methuselahs rule everything from the shadows, engaging in a eons-long Machiavellian conflict that encompasses political, social, and even physical warfare. The struggle is won or lost based on the actions taken by your minions &ndash; younger vampires who unknowingly do your bidding. In this way, the game can allow for deep and immersive storytelling as your minions purchase equipment, hire retainers, even suggest legislative changes to vampiric society, all in the service of your dark plots.<br/><br/>VTES was the second card game designed by Richard Garfield (designer of Magic the Gathering, Netrunner, and other games). It was designed to avoid some of the flaws that Garfield found in Magic: VTES does not require you to include resource or mana cards in your deck, and cards are instantly replaced when played, meaning that card draw isn&rsquo;t as important as knowing when to discard a card to sculpt a better hand. It also has a gameplay experience more in keeping with a boardgame than a traditional card game &ndash; VTES is usually played by 4 or 5 players and games can last up to 2 hours.<br/><br/>Unlike most multi-player games, players in VTES do not engage in a free-for-all. Each player directs their attacks to the player on their left (their &ldquo;prey&rdquo;) and defends against the player on their right (their &ldquo;predator&rdquo;). You gain victory points by eliminating or &ldquo;ousting&rdquo; your prey from the game, in which case the next player to the left becomes your new prey. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins (even if they have been ousted!). This arrangement makes the game a very social one &ndash; you and the player two seats to the left and right have common enemies. But if you help these allies too much, you may find that you&rsquo;ve made one of them too strong, and when they suddenly become your new predator, your help has transformed that ally into a deadly threat.<br/><br/>VTES is also a resource management game. Each player begins with 30 points of influence called &ldquo;pool&rdquo; that Methuselahs hold dearer than unlife itself. If you run out of pool, you are ousted from the game. But this pool is also the way that you sway vampires to your cause. Each turn you have the opportunity to spend your pool to seduce a vampire. Weak fledgling vampire are easily swayed, but the older more powerful ones require convincing, which may require multiple turns to accomplish. Once a vampire is converted to your side, all the pool you spent on them becomes blood possessed by this vampire, which can be spent to play cards that allow them to activate their unique vampiric powers. Each minion must manage their blood and you must manage your pool &ndash; spending more provides you with additional minions, but brings you one step closer to being ousted. Under- or over- investing in your minions may well cost you the game.<br/><br/>Although the last official card set was released in 2010 by White Wolf, VTES is still played and enjoyed by players around the world. Tournaments still draw large groups of attendees, and some continental championships see more than 100 players attend. The game is currently supported by Vampire: Elder Kindred Network&trade;, the official player organization responsible for sanctioning and regulating VTES tournaments, recording V:TES players&rsquo; ratings (and rankings), as well as designing and releasing new digital expansions featuring profession artwork.

Travel on the interior board, possible only by landing exactly on its entrance or possession of a plastic permit token (obtained by landing on other spaces), permits drilling once one has a drilling company. This is very much a costly hit-and-miss affair, especially when drilling without any other proven oil fields nearby.<br/><br/>If the player does not go bankrupt, eventually his plots should be populated with a lot of black plastic pegs indicating gushers rather than the yellow ones which signify dry holes. Then each time a player passes the start, he is paid based on the number of barrels he is pumping.<br/><br/>Unlike Monopoly, the idea is not to drive others into bankruptcy, but to be the first to reach one million dollars. While there is a good atmosphere of real drilling situations, there is also much chaos in the dice, cards and spinner.<br/><br/>"}, "2125": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1152391.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Walter Zamkauskas"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1992", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["N\u00e9stor Romeral Andr\u00e9s"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)", "Ediciones de Mente", "Kadon Enterprises", "nestorgames"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1152391_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "description": "The game is played on a square grid, usually 10 by 10.

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>This is a very simple CCG based on the movie Star Wars: Episode I.<br/><br/>First, after shuffling, you see who goes first (usually drawing &quot;destiny&quot;) and then draw 6 cards from your reserve deck.  The player who goes first usually chose the planet to battle at first.  And, from these 6 cards, you then deploy up to 6 &quot;counters&quot; worth of cards from your hand.  These can be Locations (if you are on the same planet), weapons and characters.  There were also &quot;effect&quot; cards that could be deployed to the table to boost up your characters, power, equipment and # of counters per turn.<br/><br/>Phase two is battling for the planet you are currently on.  You lay any battle cards in your hand down and pick up your deployed character and weapon cards.  These are arranged in the order of &quot;battle card, weapon card, character card.&quot;  With the cards in order from last (first character you want to battle with) to first (last character to be battled), you place them face down in a stack and you both turn over cards until you get to a character (in the case of weapons and battle cards).  Cards turned over before the character are attached to the character (weapons and such) if the character can use them.  If the character can not use them, then they are discarded.  If you have weapons, you total up the number of &quot;power dots&quot; (red dots) and draw destiny.  That is the top card of your reserve deck.  You then look at the small number on the &quot;die&quot; in the upper right hand corner of the card.  You add this power to the character.  Whichever character has more power wins and the loser discards his character and attached cards.  Damage is listed on the card that lost.  The loser then discards that many cards off the top of his or her deck.  Both players then turn over their cards in the fight deck for the next characters to fight, etc. If the attacker ends up with more characters then the defender then the defender discards 1 card for each.  The cards that survived the battle remain at the planet for the next round.<br/><br/>The final phase is called even up.  Pick up your original hand and you may discard it before drawing back up to 6 cards then go back to phase one again.  If you have more than 6 cards in your hand, you have to discard down to 6.  If you have less than, and you wish to keep them, you then draw to equal 6.  If you are not satisfied with your hand, you can discard the whole thing and draw 6 fresh cards.<br/><br/>If after a battle you are the only one with characters left on a planet you have won it and you move to the next planet which is chosen by the winner of the planet.  You can also &quot;surrender&quot; the planet.<br/><br/>You win by controlling 2 of the 3 planets or by running your opponent out of cards.<br/><br/>There are a lot of other little things involved but that is basically how the game goes.

In front of the Guardian you place a set of 3 stronghold cards.  These are locations that give you bonuses.  In front of these are 3 empty spaces that terrain cards will be placed.  These will match up to the other players 3 empty spaces thus creating the board.<br/><br/>Onto your stronghold you can place creatures under a shield to keep them hidden.  Only creatures under a shield can move and they can move up to 2 spaces with some restrictions.  There is a limit to what can be put under the shields so you can not make your army too big.<br/><br/>When two armies met they battle.  Combat is fairly detailed.  Both players pick up their cards from under the shields to make a combat hand.  Each player secretly chooses one creature and they are placed down on the table.  The stronger then covers the weaker.  This is repeated for each creature until only one player has creatures left in his hand.  He can then assign these creatures to help any of the previous creatures placed.  There are many modifiers involved and each stack of creatures must be checked for a winner.  All losers are discarded.  After determining each battle the total strength of each army is checked.  The weaker army must then retreat or the attacker in case of a tie.<br/><br/>To win you must either control all six of the lands between the strongholds, destroy 5 of the opponents shields or destroy the opposing Guardian.<br/><br/>The game is fairly complicated but very straight forward.<br/><br/>Special mention must be made of the artwork.  There is no better looking game on the market.  The illustrations are large and very well drawn.

Should they concentrate on corrupting humans and Garou to do the Wyrm's bidding? Should they fight the Garou claw to claw? Or should they win the war by destroying every last thing the Garou love and cherish?<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Each player has two decks. One deck is his &quot;Sept&quot; hand.  This is composed of allies, equipment, fetishes, events, victims, gifts, quests, and several other card types depending on which expansions you are using.  The other deck is a combat deck showing special maneuvers which are used when two characters are engaged in combat.<br/><br/>Play begins with each player laying out his pack (collection of Character cards).  These are all the characters the player will have for that game.  The game ends when one pack achieves the same number of Renown as they had starting Renown.  Typically, players start with a 20 Renown pack (each character has a Renown) and thus the game ends when someone has 20 renown in their victory pile.<br/><br/>Play is simultaneous, with all players taking actions at the same time - conflicts are generally resolved based on the renown of the character taking an action; well known characters go first.  The game is split into several phases:<br/>Redraw - draw your Sept hand back to 5 cards<br/>Regeneration - heal characters that have been hurt<br/>Resource - play most cards like gifts, equipment etc.<br/>Umbra - play special umbra cards and actions<br/>Moot - play special cards which may change rules. These must be voted on by all players.<br/>Combat - resolve any fights.<br/><br/>Each round a player designates one of his characters as Alpha.  The Alpha becomes the primary actor for that round.  During the combat round, Alphas may:<br/>1) Attack another Alpha<br/>2) Attack a victim<br/>3) Attack an enemy<br/>4) Challenge an ally or a non-Alpha character<br/>5) Attack a territory<br/>6) Do nothing.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved using a separate deck which allows special maneuvers.<br/><br/>Renown (victory points) are earned by defeating rival characters and enemies. Some packs may reverse the rules and gain victory by defeating victims.

The Egyptian onslaught was spearheaded by seven divisions and over a thousand tanks - with another three divisions and 300 tanks in reserve around Cairo.  Despite these long odds, the Israelis believed they would be able to repel the assault with relative ease.<br/><br/>Within 72 hours, the assumptions that formed the foundation of the Israeli strategy - the defensive value of the Suez Canal, the absolute superiority of Israeli troops, and the decisive role of the Israeli Air Force - were proven to be shockingly, undeniably mistaken.  First of all, the Egyptians, displaying an unexpected mastery of engineering technique, built no fewer than ten bridges over the Canal by the end of October 7 - an achievement which enabled them to pour tanks and other heavy equipment across much faster than the Israelis had thought possible.  More shocking yet, every Israeli counterthrust had been thrown back, with appalling losses.  Those supposedly inferior Egyptian troops did not falter in the face of the immediate and violent Israeli counterattacks, but bravely stood their ground - knocking out better than 300 Israeli tanks in the first three days of the war.  Finally, when the Israeli Air Force was sent to the rescue of the hard-pressed ground forces, it ran into an almost impenetrable wall of antiaircraft guns and SAMs (including the hitherto unknown - and very deadly - Soviet SA-6s) that took a dreadful toll of the attacking Phantoms and Skyhawks.<br/><br/>History tells us that the Israelis managed to overcome the initial consequences of their own hubris and overconfidence, and reverse the course of the war, through a combination of sheer guts, brilliant improvisation, and superior technique in mobile warfare.  Yet, the outcome of the war along the Suez Canal was, to quote Wellington, &quot;A very near run thing,&quot; that might easily have ended in a humiliating Israeli defeat.<br/><br/>TIME SCALE    12 hours per turn<br/>MAP SCALE    2.5 miles per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE    Battalion / Brigade<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS    One to four<br/>PLAYING TIME    Two to twelve hours<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["GMT first edition"], "average": "6.52529", "name": "Crisis: Sinai 1973", "playingtime": "360", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "87", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Crisis Series", "Yom Kippur War"]}, "2139": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic224217.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ron Kent", "Duncan Macdonell"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1996", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "10", "boardgamepublisher": ["The United States Playing Card Company"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic224217_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Collectible Components", "Deduction", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "description": "Based on the show of the same name this is clue on speed.

The GeneStealers win by stopping the Space Marines from achieving their goal, usually by killing them all. A unique mechanism is that the Genestealers have no time limit for their turn, but the Space Marines have a 3 minute time limit, and less if a sergeant is killed. This simulates the fact that Genestealers move so much quicker and adds a lot of tension to the game for the Marine player.<br/><br/>The miniatures are excellent although you do have to paint them yourselves and the modular board is very well done.<br/><br/>The Deathwing Expansion adds new personnel, weapons, rules for multilevel hulks, new missions and a mission generator along with some complexity.<br/><br/>The Genestealer Expansion adds new marines, weapons, Genestealer Hybrids who can use weapons and new missions. There are also rules for psychic powers.<br/><br/>There was also the Space Hulk Campaign Book  that can be linked for longer games.

In fact, Pok&eacute;mon was one of the first Collectible Card Games to offer any competition to the market dominance of Magic:  The Gathering, even though most of the people who buy the product do not play the game, choosing instead to collect their favorite characters from the franchise the game is based upon.[citation needed]<br/><br/>The object of the game is to play your Pok&eacute;mon cards, that represent different creatures, to battle against each other.  The first player to &quot;knock out&quot; (defeat) six opposing Pok&eacute;mon wins the game.  You play the game with a deck of sixty cards that represent your Pok&eacute;mon, as well as Trainer cards and Energy cards.  Trainer cards affect the game, players or Pok&eacute;mon in different ways, most of them temporary, while Energy cards act as the resources in the game.<br/><br/>You start the game by drawing seven cards.  Each player picks a Basic Pok&eacute;mon from their hand and places it in front of them to start.  This is called the Active Pok&eacute;mon and is the one currently dueling.  Players can also place other Basic Pok&eacute;mon to fill up the five slots on their &quot;Bench&quot;.  Six cards are then set aside to act as Prizes.  Each time you defeat one of your opponent's Pok&eacute;mon, you get to draw one of these Prize cards.  Players take alternating turns during which they can:<br/><br/>     put Pok&eacute;mon in play on their Bench<br/>     place an Energy card on one of their Pok&eacute;mon (once per turn)<br/>     play Trainer cards<br/>     evolve one of their Pok&eacute;mon<br/>     retreat - Have their Active Pok&eacute;mon trade places with one on the Bench (usually at the cost of Energy cards)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In addition to Basic Pok&eacute;mon cards, there are also Evolution cards, which depict evolved forms of Basic Pok&eacute;mon (or sometimes other Evolved Pok&eacute;mon). A player can evolve a Pok&eacute;mon by laying a corresponding Evolution card onto another Pok&eacute;mon card in play.  This can only be done once per turn per Pok&eacute;mon, and only if the Pok&eacute;mon has been in play at least one entire turn.  The Evolved Pok&eacute;mon retains any damage and Energy cards, but loses any Special Conditions affecting it, and the card text completely replaces the previous card.<br/><br/>The last action a player takes during their turn, if they choose, is to have their Active Pok&eacute;mon use one of its abilities to attack the other player's Active Pok&eacute;mon.  Attacks can only be used if the Pok&eacute;mon has enough Energy cards of the right type attached to it to meet the requirements for the attack; each attack has different requirements and effects that are listed on the card.  Most attacks will do some amount of damage to the Defending Pok&eacute;mon; if defeated, the Defending Pok&eacute;mon is replaced with another Pok&eacute;mon from the Bench, and the attacker draws a Prize card.  If either the attacker draws their last Prize card or the Defender cannot replace the Active Pok&eacute;mon (due to an empty Bench), the attacker has won the game.<br/><br/>There are many different varieties of Pok&eacute;mon available and several different forms of each one, each with different attacks, abilities and characteristics, allowing for many different possible outcomes.

Your front three dragons can fight the opponents front three dragons so you do have to be careful how you place.  Flying dragons can fight over one row.

In name and power, the pieces are standard chessmen, but they are shaped like Stratego pieces so that each player can only identify the pieces of his own army. At the start both sides arrange their armies any way they like on the first two ranks. Pawns are allowed to move two squares forward on either the first or second rank. The object is to capture the enemy King. The identity of a piece is revealed when it is captured. The official rules then call for the piece to be returned to its previous owner (off the board), facing away from its captor.<br/><br/>Stealth Chess has the same pieces as conventional chess(16 Black &amp; 16 White) but unlike traditional chess, all pieces look the same and have the pieces title printed on the back side so your only chance to win is to memorize the movement of your opponents and which piece was moved. This memory play helps with regular chess play by improving your memory.<br/><br/>The game begins with pieces being randomly placed by each player in the first and second row of each side of the board. You decide the strategic possibilities of the placement of your pieces. For example, you might put your Queen front-row center and hide your King in a corner. The excitement begins with the first move. From that point forward, you must try to figure out your opponent's pieces by their movements and seek out and capture the King. Of course, you may &quot;disguise&quot; a powerful piece by moving it as if it were a mere Pawn--until you strike without warning. No check, no checkmate. Boom! Victory is yours.<br/><br/>There are several different rule sets included that the players agree upon beforehand. The simplest is a standard opening position setup.

Four-player versions of chess probably have existed for hundreds of years prior to Verney in one form or another.  Verney's four-player board consists of three rows added to each side of a standard 2-player board, and four complete sets of chessmen in four different colors.  Modern four-player boards and colored pieces are available from several manufacturers.<br/><br/>In Verney's version (1881), 4 player chess was a partnership game, and the object was to checkmate both opposing partners at the same time.  In modern variants, four player games can range from partners, to cutthroat (every player for himself), to temporary alliances at will.<br/><br/>Starting configuration affects fairness (bias).  The standard 2-player configuration of queen facing queen is biased in four player chess because there is only one axis of symmetry.  Four player chess requires two axes of symmetry to be fair (unbiased).  To avoid bias, Verney recommended a staring configuration of all queens on light (or all on dark) squares.  Another unbiased starting configuration is all queens on the right (or all on the left) of the king.<br/><br/>For the most part, four player chess follows (or can follow) all the normal rules of two-player chess.  Verney had special rules for partnership playing, disallowed castling, and pawns had to make it to the enemies last rank in order to be exchanged for another piece.  Pawns could also march up and back down the board.  Verney also had checkmate as the ultimate move.<br/><br/>In modern variations of four-player chess, partnering may not be required, but allowable, castling can be allowed, and actual capturing of a king a required move to eliminate a player.  The Chess Federation does not recognize four-player chess in any form, and there are no official rules, so players are free to experiment with variations and make their own rules.<br/><br/>See also:<br/><br/>        Bughouse Chess<br/>        Vendetta<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "4", "boardgameversion": ["Chessapeak Porta-Challenge edition", "EW Finks English edition", "First Edition", "Masteray edition", "MasteRay single-fold board", "Taurus Games vinyl roll-up edition", "WOW Toys gray box edition"], "average": "6.01634", "name": "4 Player Chess", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement", "Player Elimination"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "303", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Chess Games"]}, "2174": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic269702.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Dragonmaster", "Indulgence"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["G.

The first part of the game is the auction, by which partners attempt to communicate information about their hands by bidding, in order to arrive at a successful contract. The contract specifies how many tricks must be taken by the team that wins the bid. After the auction, a member of the team that won the bid tries to win as many tricks as possible while playing both hands from the partnership. One hand is played normally while the other (the &quot;dummy hand&quot;) is placed face-up on the table, allowing for greater control. The defenders attempt to take enough tricks to make the contract fail.<br/><br/>The formal name of the game is Contract Bridge, but the shortened name &quot;Bridge&quot; is the most common usage. Bridge developed from the 17th Century card game Whist. The earliest form of Bridge originated in 1886 when rules were introduced allowing the dealer to choose a trump and his or her partner's hand to become dummy. Bridge became Auction Bridge in 1904, which allowed the trump suit to be decided by the highest bidding partnership. Harold Vanderbilt transformed Auction Bridge into Contract Bridge in 1925,when he introduced an improved method of scoring.<br/><br/>The duplicate version of the game has many pairs of partners, each playing the same hands separately and comparing their results. This method removes the element of luck in getting good cards when comparing players and thus helps to isolate the role of skill in the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "4", "boardgameversion": ["Ariel English edition", "ASS Dutch edition", "Atlantic Playing Card Company edition 1949", "Chas Goodall Hoffman edition 1908", "David Westnedge red edition", "Hasbro Family Fun edition 1974", "House of Marbles cream box edition", "House of Marbles edition 2012", "Michael Stanfield edition 1981", "Piatnik English edition", "Piatnik English/French edition in blue box", "Piatnik English/French edition in maroon box", "Piatnik French edition", "Playbox French edition 1979", "Public Domain edition", "TAG English edition", "W.

You then play a plot card and more challenges. Then a discovery card and yep, more challenges (well&hellip; really you just resolve any outstanding challenges). At the end each side gets points called XC for how they did or did not do during the Episode phase.  The Current player gets XC for completing the episode while the Challenger gets XC for stifling the Current Player's efforts.<br/><br/>XC is put on the core crew and crew you enter on your side and the first player to end their turn with 25+ XC total on the crew wins.

Recently, it has also come out with two expansions which were released in tins: Faith of our Fathers (FooF) and Rock of Ages (RoA).<br/><br/>At its core, the gameplay is simple: use your Heroes to rescue Lost Souls from your opponent's Land of Bondage, and use your Evil Characters to defend your own Lost Souls from your opponent.  Enhancements may be played on these characters in turn to affect the final outcome of the battle.  The characters and enhancements are divided up into colored &quot;brigades&quot; to emphasize theme and maintain variety and balance.  The depth of gameplay is expanded with various support cards, such as Sites, Fortresses and Artifacts.  Dominant cards may also be played by anybody at any time, and can turn the game around in an instant.<br/><br/>Redemption is unique among its CCG counterparts in several ways.  The cards are based on characters, locations and events from the Bible.  So while no particular tradition or &quot;brand&quot; of Christianity is emphasized over another, this source material provides a solid theme for the game.  Accordingly, many of the cards and their effects bear a historical or thematic parallel to their corresponding Scripture, making Redemption an effective learning tool as well.<br/><br/>Also, while variety and depth of strategy are key factors in developing new expansions, the chance elements of the card draw and Dominant card play are never fully mitigated, allowing younger or less skilled players something of an equalizer.  This is consistent with designer Rob Anderson's philosophy that the emphasis be placed on fun and fellowship over pure competition.

Players can double-score items if they can get a collection of three or more items of the same color/category.

In any given turn, playing pieces representing various townspeople will be moved across the gamemap, which is a map of Pleasantville.<br/><br/>The Alien player will try to keep the whereabouts of the Alien-controlled townspeople a secret, while he or she &quot;takes over&quot; more unsuspecting townspeople and builds up strength for the final showdown with the Town player.

The Town player will try to convince the townspeople that there is an alien menace in the town, and will attempt to fight any Alien-controlled townspeople encountered.  With luck and careful play, the Town player hopes to defeat the Alien-controlled&quot;zombies&quot;, locate the Alien Headquarters, and destroy the Alien Sub-Commander.&quot;<br/><br/>The game mechanic involves use of two identical sets of carboard chits - one set having a star on the back indicating alien control.

A fun game for two players who enjoy bluffing and like simulating the action of classic movies like Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Invaders from Mars.

Players move one piece per turn and can eliminate the other player's pieces by moving into their space. Movement options depend on which piece it is you're moving. In a fit of conspicuous difference, it's the black side who makes the opening move here.<br/><br/>The central gimmick is that each piece is composed of two parts, a body and a head. The height of the body determines how far a piece can move (one, two or three spaces), whereas the head determines the directions: straight lines (like rooks), diagonals (like bishops), or both (like kings or queens). Each side also has one super-powered queen/rook hybrid which can move to any space within the range determined by its body, and even one unbeatable but immobile head.<br/><br/>There's a reason for all this separation into bodies and heads: after every move the piece which just moved must swap heads with a different type of head, chosen by the player from their pieces still in play.<br/><br/>There are two victory conditions: either you move one of your pieces to a specific target square on the far side of the board, or you force your opponent to make an illegal move. Draws are possible, but rare (they require both sides' forces to be extremely depleted).<br/><br/>The theme is pretty much irrelevant - this is an abstract at heart. The rulebook frames the game as the secret strategy-honing tool of the nobles in a fictional culture, and the rules introduction is presented in dialogue form with the Wise Old Master teaching the game to his Young Noble Student, but none of this is at all relevant to gameplay. In fact, the game presented within the fiction is themeless and, quite literally, abstract: the pieces' names are translated as abstract concepts like 'strength' etc.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Edition Perlhuhn edition", "Franckh-Kosmos Edition Perlhuhn edition"], "age": "10", "name": "Ayanu", "playingtime": "30", "average": "7.07188", "usersrated": "32", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Combinatorial", "Edition Perlhuhn series at Franckh-Kosmos", "Tube Games"]}, "2231": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Claude Soucie"], "poll": [], "name": "Watch", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1967", "usersrated": "21", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic44479_t.jpg", "average": "6.02381", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["ABACUSSPIELE", "Campaign Game Company Inc.", "MPH Games Co."], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic44479.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Campaign Game Company Travel Edition", "German Edition", "MPH Edition"], "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Tactical game of elimination and isolation with variable starting positions.<br/><br/>The 25 wooden playing pieces in 10 different colours are placed on the 25 squares on the board.

It employs a scale of 300 meters per hex, with daily turns and 2160 counters.<br/><br/>The most luscious wargame ever produced (OK no more editorializing). This game has possibly sunk more companies than Hasbro. The two designers spent years researching the orders of battle and aerial maps to produce a game that is possibly the most researched and arguably the most accurate depiction of a battle, mechanics aside.<br/><br/>The large, fairly thin but sturdy counters are the shades of the uniforms of the armies according to the designers. Instead of the usual American style designations on the counters to depict what type of unit it is the designers used the actual designators used by the separate armies. This could be confusing except for the wonderful large player aids supplied with actual photos of the unit types. Labels and ziplock bag are even supplied for sorting purposes although sorting can be confusing. Moves mag put out an issue in the late '70's, early '80's with an article that fixed the problem.<br/><br/>The 3 large maps are taken straight from aerial photos. You see the city block by block and outside the city individual buildings can even be seen. There is very little color on the maps but they are beautiful and very functional. The terrain effects chart once again has actual photos of the terrain so you can get an idea of exactly what the soldiers were facing.<br/><br/>There are many scenarios available so you can tailor the game for time and room as some only use 1 map or a portion of a map. Each scenario has a separate set up sheet for both sides that are large enough to put all the counters on the sheets. Each scenario has a miniature version of the map to be used with set up information. For a monster game it is very easy to set up and get into a game.<br/><br/>There are 3 rulebooks included, 2 basic game and 1 advanced game. When learning the game it is fantastic that they included a rulebook for each player. This is the kind of detail that is evident throughout the game. The rule books are detailed without being overbearing, as a lot of Avalon Hill's and SPI's were from the time period. They are chock full of examples to clear up ambiguities.<br/><br/>The game is difficult because of the scale only. It is actually a fairly simple game, mechanics wise, and can be played by anyone with some wargame experience.

Players will recreate the first six months of furious aerial combat between the might of Imperial Japan and the surprised forces of the United Kingdom and the United States.<br/><br/>Zero! includes the important early-war fighters and bomber of the Imperial Japanese Navy and Army, Royal Air Force, United States Navy, United States Army Air Force, and the American Volunteer Group (the famous Flying Tigers). Fly the fearsome A6M2 Zero against the F4F Wildcat, Hawker Hurricane IIb, Curtiss P-40B and E Tomahawks, and the ill-fated Brewster Buffalo. As a pilot with the Japanese Army, take Ki-27 Nates and Ki-43 Oscars to the skies against the Allies over Malaya and Burma. Match your skills with American aces Wagner, Thach, McCuskey or their semi-mercenary countrymen of the AVG, Hill and Newkirk. The Japanese can counter with Sakai, Anabuki, Kato, and more.<br/><br/>As with the previous games in the series, Zero! includes the Campaigns covering the major aerial events of the December 1941 to June 1942 period. Each consists of multiple missions aimed at a variety of targets, for which you must wisely allocate your resources of men and material. New to Zero! are Carrier Campaigns, which give players some control over the carrier groups their naval squadrons fly from. Do you go all out for a decisive strike or hold your fighters back and let the enemy overextend himself? Campaigns included in this volume are: Pearl Harbor (solitaire), the Philippines, Malaya, Burma, Coral Sea, and Midway.<br/><br/>Both Down in Flames veterans and newcomers to the series will enjoy this latest volume. All the components needed to play are included - ownership of the first two volumes is not necessary, but the three games are completely compatible. Beautiful, newly-designed, full-color action cards drive gameplay, while cards representing the major aircraft of the period and counters of the famous aces allow players to explore a wide range of scenarios. Besides the new Carrier Campaigns, historically significant missions have been added to the standard campaigns and the rules have been updated and expanded.<br/><br/>Are you ready to relive history? Can you sweep the skies in the cockpit of the Zero, delaying or even stopping the appearance of American industrial might? Or will the Allies, in their outdated machines, halt the Japanese onslaught much earlier?<br/><br/>CONTENTS:    <br/><br/>     88 full-color, die-cut counters.<br/>     150 full-color Playing Cards<br/>     6 Campaign Map Displays<br/>     One Bombing Display<br/>     One Resource Sheet<br/>     One 16-page Rulebook<br/>     One 20-page Campaign Booklet<br/>     8 Target Displays<br/>     Three Campaign Logs <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Designed by Dan Verssen<br/>Developed by Mike Lemick<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "average": "6.93779", "name": "Zero!", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Hand Management"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["Corsairs and Hellcats", "Down in Flames Squadron Pack 2: Bombers", "Down in Flames: Dutch Harbor / Aleutians", "Down in Flames: Operation Leader 1943", "Down in Flames: The Netherlands East Indies", "Khalkin-Gol: 1939", "Zero!: Java \u2013 Module"], "usersrated": "553", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Down in Flames"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 94- Adrenaline"]}, "2248": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jack B.

The Ops/Events cards may denote bad weather in a region (thus reducing number of seats for that round), strikes (which can played on another airline), Fuel Price Adjustments (which effect your maintenance fees paid with Seats), and even an Aircraft Incident card (which people outside the industry call &quot;crashes.&quot;)<br/><br/>Airlines can be combined with the stand-alone game Airlines: United States Set 2.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "name": "Airlines", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "average": "4.6073", "boardgameexpansion": ["Airlines: United States Set 2"], "usersrated": "159", "age": "12", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["OBG 010: 070907 Social by Request"]}, "2277": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic49756.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1976", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Murfett Australia", "Waddington's Games, Inc."], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic49756_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Racing", "Sports"], "description": "Fortunes change at a stroke in this exciting game of betting and bluffing! Play your cards right and you'll be on a winning streak --but give too much away and you'll find your opponent's horse piping you at the post. Tension's high from the instant the horses leave their starting stalls. You keep the horse you've backed secret until you judge the moment's right to reveal it --cunning players will push other horses forward to create a &quot;false scent&quot;, then try to come through the field with a last minute burst and take the race at the winning post. If you back for a place, you play safe...But the stakes will be low. If you try for a big win...You could lose your shirt! This exciting race game keeps everyone guessing --and trying-- till the very last moment, and whether you win or lose it will provide hours of fascinating family fun.<br/><br/>Contents: Felt playing area, 42 horse movement cards, 12 betting indicator cards, money, six plastic horses in different colors, starting stalls and grandstand. In the Canadian edition, the felt became a standard board, and the starting stalls and grandstand are gone as they were just chrome (theme elements not employed in the game).<br/><br/>For each of the eight races the cards are thoroughly shuffled and dealt out to each player. The different cards (5 per horse) advance each horse at various rates (2 to 4 spaces) in the race and there are also 12 cards that affect any horse in the race (backwards 2 or forward 3). Players secretly bet on a horse to either win or place (take first or second place); you can also bet the jackpot (which is made up of all losing bets from previous races), which is like betting for a win except the minimum stake is higher and the payout is handled differently. Betting on a horse actually means taking one of its movement cards out...until you decide to play it, revealing your bet --one of this game's numerous subtleties.<br/><br/>During the race, the players play their horse cards in turn, maneuvering the horses as needed --horses have very limited sidestepping and could be blocked during the race. If a player &quot;loses his shirt&quot; i.e. goes broke, he just continues the game playing cards but not betting.<br/><br/>It can be best described as a cross between Win, Place &amp; Show and Undercover (a.k.a.

There is a big Ark sitting in the middle of the board that acts as a four-slotted piggy bank.  A whole bunch of four-squares bases shaped like lightning bolts come in three colours and represent the cool (white), temperate (green) and hot (yellow) continents.  Each of these bases can hold an animal.  The bases and animals are deployed semi-randomly at the game outset by all players (this could need to be better constrained by the rules as the set-up has considerable consequences on the game's outcome); the restriction is that each continent must form a single land mass.  Although the bases come in three heights, this is ignored in the rules.<br/><br/>The animals are colour-coded at their bases to indicate on which continent they belong.  They all come in pairs.  Some animals are predators, with a red background.  You must deploy them so as to split the pairs.  Your little boat has room for two animals on board.  You cannot carry a predator and a prey at once, but all other combinations are OK.<br/><br/>You roll a six-sided die to move; on a one, a continent base sinks (is removed) instead; you do not move.  The flooded base cannot have an animal on it, so if there are no floodable bases, you reroll.  Otherwise, you must use the exact die roll to move with --diagonals aren't allowed.  Once beside a continent, the die roll is used to send an &quot;expedition&quot; to catch an animal, which again must be reached by exact count.  If the trail goes through another animal  as well, you have the option of capturing it too.  You go back to your two &quot;berth&quot; spaces beside the Ark to drop the animals off --this also gets you a free second move.<br/><br/>Once the last animal is removed from the land, the game ends instantly.  All animals in transit (on board players' boats) are discarded and those in the Ark are scored.  Prey are worth one, predators two.  A pair of animals doubles in worth.  If you have animals from each of the three continents, your score doubles.<br/><br/>As the Ark hides the animals dropped in its compartments, there is an element of memory involved --you should try to remember what each player has brought back so far to have an idea of who's in the lead.<br/><br/>The movement system is annoying because diagonals aren't allowed (so parity conservation is enforced) and actually makes the game drag a bit at the end; it'd suggest playing that exact rolls aren't required --or that diagonals are allowed.<br/><br/>"}, "2310": {"boardgamedesigner": ["J\u00fcrgen P.

Three to eight players take over such roles as the Mad Scientist, the Space Pirate Captain, the Phone Company, or a mystery Alien. Because the format is four way blind, and the players are uncertain of each other's motives, the fog of war is a formidable obstacle in this new gaming genre.<br/><br/>The action takes place on a space warehouse at the edge of an un-navigable region of the Galaxy known as the Coal Sack. The mad scientist in charge of the facility is trying to sell the Artifact, an alien navigational buoy, to  space pirates. The scientist wins if he completes the deal while keeping his illegal activities secret from the Phone Company, who has a couple of agents on board the station somewhere.<br/><br/>Victory for the Phone Company depends upon who their secret employers are. His agents may be just innocent employees here to fix the phone lines, they may be working for a rival Museum, or they may work for the Government or private agencies.<br/><br/>The Pirate Captain's motives are more transparent; he needs to get the Artifact by trade, artifice, or force. Even with his overwhelming firepower, this is not easy. One of his men may be a government informant. The Artifact may not be all it seems. Loss of contact with his men may mean they have turned against him, or alien bugs have laid eggs on their disemboweled remains. A clank outside may signal imminent explosive decompression, or just a sailmaker robot on the outside hull doing its job.<br/><br/>Aliens may or may not be on board; their nature is unknown. The ship's computer may or may not be a sentient character working with its own victory conditions. One's partner may be a trusted companion or a shapeshifting fiend in disguise. The ship's security system, robots, and self-destruct countdown may be puppets for unknown agencies.<br/><br/>The Artifact is a gripping drama, full of surprises and mayhem. No two games are alike, full of sabotage, sneak suits, bluster, kamikaze aliens, EMP and plasma guns, booby traps, hacking, and the prospect of the space station being blown up bit by bit by pirate cannon.

A player ends one&rsquo;s turn by replenishing the hand. A player may exchange up to four cards from one&rsquo;s own hand instead.<br/><br/>When the deck is exhausted, a &ldquo;Market Closed&rdquo; card is added to the deck. The deck is reshuffled and when the &ldquo;Market Closed&rdquo; card comes up the game ends. All stock held by the players is converted into cash and the player with the most money is the winner.<br/><br/>The rules of the game were published in the book Card Games Around the World.

Once the ice is reached, they proceed on foot or by sled as far as they dare, limited by bad food, weather, crevasses, scurvy, deep snow, and mutiny. Due to the &quot;you against the elements&quot; nature of the expeditions, player interaction is minimized, making for an excellent solitaire game. Three solitaire scenarios are included, as well as the 2 to 5 player competition game that includes disaster card play and newspaper attacks on your opponents. Rulesbook, 195 cards, player aid charts, and expedition log sheets are included.

Translated loosely as &quot;elephant game&quot;, the name of XiangQi may have first been recorded in Songs of Chu during the 4th century BC of early China; in the state of Qi during the Warring State Period, the name &quot;XiangQi&quot; meant ivory Liubo pieces, not modern XiangQi played by Chinese. The modern Xiangqi set dates back to the Tang dynasty.<br/><br/>Based closely on ancient Chinese military strategy, XiangQi draws comparisons to European Chess, and indeed, both are descended from the ancient Indian game of Chaturanga.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>XiangQi, commonly referred to in English as &quot;Chinese Chess&quot;, is played with 32 pieces (16 per player) on a board that is 9 lines wide and 10 lines long. As in the game of Go, the game is played on the intersections of the game board. The area of play is divided into two territories by a river in the middle of game board. In each territory there is a 3 line by 3 line palace, in which each player's respective General/Marshal is located. The object of the game is to capture the opponents's General/Marshal.<br/><br/>The pieces on both sides and their movements &amp; special rules are:<br/><br/><br/>    1 General: 1 Point orthogonally within the palace only. Not allowed to &lsquo;see&rsquo; the enemy General on an open file.<br/>    2 Advisors: 1 point diagonally within the palace only.<br/>    2 Chariots: Any distance orthogonally.<br/>    2 Cannons: Moves like a Chariot. To capture, it must first leap over an intervening piece of either color.<br/>    2 Horses: 1 point orthogonally, then one point diagonally.<br/>    2 Elephants / Ministers: 2 points diagonally. Cannot cross the river.<br/>    5 Soldiers: 1 point straight forward.  Once across the river, can also move 1 point sideways instead.<br/><br/><br/>Pieces capture as they move and never jump. The only exception (for both rules) apply to the cannon.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The price of the game varies depending on the material used in the game. Inexpensive sets are usually made with plastic or low-grade wooden pieces and a paper gameboard.

The game is about diverting water from rivers into irrigation channels and supplying the life-giving water to sections of land.  In 18xx, there are private companies; in Ur, there are independent nations.  In 18xx, there are companies with shareholders and a majority-controlling president; in Ur, there are countries with landowners and a majority-controlling King.  Once a Kingdom has enough land purchased in it, it begins to build water infrastructure in the form of reservoirs and pumps.  These structures draw the water away from the rivers into irrigation channels which are drawn straight on the board.  Like 18xx, the technology increases as the game progresses, making channel diggers obsolete and bringing out more efficient waterworks.  When a section of land is irrigated, the owner earns a small degree income and the kingdom it's located in earns a much larger income, which can then be given to the landowners or kept in the Kingdom's coffers for future upgrades.  The game is finally over when all the incoming water is used, forcing the southern tribes to invade, or a kingdom cannot fulfill it's obligation to buy more ditch-diggers and falls into revolution.

Each player has a set of 15 &quot;men&quot; that must be moved from their starting positions, around, and then off the board. Dice are thrown each turn, and each player must decide which of his men to move based on the outcome of the roll. Players can capture each other's men, forcing the captured men to restart their journey around the board. The winner is the first player to get all 15 men off the board. A more recent addition to the game is the &quot;doubling cube&quot;, which allows players to up the stakes of the game, as it is often played for money. Although the game relies on dice to determine movement, there is a large degree of strategy in deciding how to make the most effective moves given each dice roll as well as measuring the risk in terms of possible rolls the opponent may get.<br/><br/>Backgammon may be the first game to be mentioned in written history, going back 5,000 years to the Sumerians of ancient Mesopotamia. During the 1920's, archaeologists unearthed five boards from a cemetery in the ancient town of Ur. At another location, pieces and dice were also found along with the board. Boards from ancient Egypt have also been recovered from the tomb of Tutankhamun, including a mechanical dice box, no doubt intended to stop cheaters.<br/><br/>The names of the game were many.

This is repeated until all players have exhausted their hand of cards.  Once all players are out of cards, each player picks up his hand and determines all possible scoring combinations, pegging points again on the cribbage board.

As in backgammon, the objective is to bear all of one's pawns off first.  A couple of interesting differences is that there are safe and trap spaces on the board.  Also, players may block each others' progress as in Parchisi.  Senet sets are usually constructed from various woods and are often quite beautiful.  Senet is one of the oldest of man's games but unfortunately it fell out of use for a few thousand years and no ancient rules set has been discovered.

In this version, at the end of each turn, a new card is drawn from the deck to replace the card that was played, so that each player is always working from five cards.<br/><br/>A player's fortunes can change dramatically in one or two rounds of play through the use of Sorry cards, the &quot;11&quot; cards (which give the player the option of trading places with an opponent's piece on the track), and the fact that it is possible to move from Start to Home without circumnavigating the full board by making judicious use of the &quot;backward 4&quot; cards.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Basic Fun keychain edition", "BCM De Luxe First Edition", "BCM Double Pack First Edition", "BCM edition", "BCM first edition", "Borras Spanish edition", "Borras Spanish edition 1980", "Copp Clark edition 1938", "Editrice Dark Blue Edition", "Estrela Brazilian Edition", "First edition", "Game Office Portuguese Edition", "Grow Edition", "Hasbro / Parker Brothers Retro Games Edition", "Hasbro Canadian bilingual edition", "Hasbro English edition 1992", "Hasbro English edition 2008", "Hasbro Family Game Night Edition", "Hasbro Retro metallic box version", "Hasbro Star Wars edition", "John Waddington Edition 1951", "John Waddington Edition 1969", "Juegos Crone Spanish edition", "Parker Brothers \"Family Game Night\" edition 2001", "Parker Brothers \"Family Game Night\" edition 2005", "Parker Brothers / General Mills Fun Group edition", "Parker Brothers / Hasbro edition", "Parker Brothers 70th Birthday edition", "Parker Brothers Australia / New Zealand edition", "Parker Brothers edition 1934", "Parker Brothers edition 1958", "Parker Brothers Edition 1964", "Parker Brothers edition 1992", "Parker Brothers Nostalgia Games Series", "Parker Brothers Small Box edition 1939", "Parker Brothers Travel Edition", "Parker Brothers Vintage Collection wooden book edition", "Parker Brothers Vintage Collection wooden box edition", "Parker German edition 1980", "Parker-Brohm German Edition", "Waddington Classic Children's Edition", "Waddingtons 1970's Edition", "Waddingtons edition 1977", "Waddingtons edition 1983", "Waddingtons Look Learn and Play Edition"], "average": "4.49617", "name": "Sorry!", "videogamebg": ["Hasbro Family Game Night: Sorry"], "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Point to Point Movement", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "age": "6", "usersrated": "4175", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Children's Games", "Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Pachisi-Ludo", "Sorry!"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["OBG 27: Monopoly and More", "Sorry!", "The Good, The Board and The SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY: Episode 66 \u201c"]}, "2408": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "poll": [], "name": "Digimon Digital Monsters", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Role Playing", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "2000", "usersrated": "19", "boardgamefamily": ["Anime & Manga", "Monsters"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic27140_t.jpg", "average": "4.88421", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Mad Hatter's Toy & Game Factory"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic27140.jpg", "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "from the box:<br/>&quot;Based on Fox Kids it TV Series 'Digimon'<br/>Choose to be your favorite Kid.

As ships are sunk, the players gets fewer shots).  This version of the game is closer to the original pencil-and-paper public domain game.  Many versions of the pencil-and-paper game have different amounts of shots based on the ship (IE: Battleship: 5 shots.

The Americans have 16 units spread all over the board (including a special &quot;Continental Army&quot; unit), 1 warship and a troop carrier with 4 reinforcements on board.<br/><br/>The Americans use two dice for movement (unless down to just one unit), the British one. All three dice are 0-1-1-1-2-3. Both players roll their dice using shakers and peek at them. The British player designates the unit he'll move, then the American reveals his throw and moves. Finally, the Bristish reveals his throw and moves.<br/><br/>A single unit is moved by each die --the grid is square and no diagonals are allowed. Units that end up on the same spot stack to form an army (which cannot be split), but each army is limited to 6 units. Naval moves are harbour to harbour except for the troop carriers (and any warship attempting to intercept them).<br/><br/>A Skirmish occurs when opposing units are adjacent. A card is drawn to resolve the Skirmish. This can result in a unit loss for either side (sometimes two), a major battle being triggered, or one or both armies moving a space or two. Major battles normally occur when an army lands on an enemy army by exact count; numerical superiority is added to the stronger side's throw, and the adjusted throw difference indicates how many units the losing side lost (however, that loss is limited to the number of units in the winning army).<br/><br/>Once the British have lost an army, they can call for Reinforcements. The Americans can do this once they've won a Major Battle. Reinforcement play is resolved separately from normal play. Two dice are used by both sides, one player trying to bring in his troop carrier whilst the other attempts to intercept with a warship (if the opponent has no warships left, the reinforcements automatically succeed). If the troop carrier makes it to a harbor, the reinforcements land (triggering a major battle if the harbor is enemy-held) and the troop carrier remains as a normal warship henceforth.<br/><br/>The British win by eliminating the Continental Army, whilst the American wins by eliminating all four British armies. To keep the game from dragging on, if there is no skirmish nor major battle in 10 moves, the weaker side surrenders.<br/><br/>The asymmetrical mechanics work surprisingly well; the British lacks mobility and try to force Major Battles on the Americans, whilst the latter skirmish as much as possible until they can muster a large enough army together to win a major battle and call in their reinforcements.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Milton Bradley First Edition"], "average": "6.07647", "name": "Skirmish", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Point to Point Movement"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "153", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["American Heritage Games"]}, "2428": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic52510.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1961", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "10", "boardgamepublisher": ["Milton Bradley"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic52510_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["American Civil War", "Wargame"], "description": "One of the American Heritage Command Decision Strategy Games.<br/><br/>This one is the American Civil War game.  Each side has 22 pieces (10 infantry, 10 cavalry and 2 artillery), and the starting positions are fixed.  The grid is square, with no diagonal movement allowed.  On your turn, you roll two dice for movement, resulting in between 2 and 12 movement points to allocate.  Infantry moves 1 per pip, cavalry and artillery 2 per pip (a one-square move still consumes 1 pip).  Mountains force pieces to pause (they must stop until the next turn).  Railroads link stations and can be used to accelerate movement (one station per pip).<br/><br/>Combat is handled by lining pieces up (horizontally or vertically) to face (or flank) an enemy column.  You must have battle strength superiority to resolve the battle, and this is done after movement is concluded.  Infantry and artillery have combat strength 2, cavalry has combat strength 1.  The rear piece then jumps to the other end of the combined columns, and the entire enemy army is removed.  To be used, cavalry must have a piece at the front; artillery, if at the rear of your column, eliminates the enemy army without jumping.  Artillery cannot attack by itself.  Double jumps can happen, if the jumping infantry piece ends up facing a lone cavalry.  An open square must exist to jump to, so some map deployments are &quot;safe&quot; --but not against artillery.  However, pieces trapped so they cannot move are also removed as if they had lost a battle, so this strategy can backfire.<br/><br/>You win by completely eliminating the enemy army --but a player may concede earlier when a loss becomes unavoidable.

While he is gone, he trusts the nobility of the land will behave themselves, as good nobles should.  Little did King Timothy realize that his nobles were planning to use his leaving as a chance to conquer one another.  Knowing the King could come back at any time, the Barons of Fyn each fought to get as much power as possible, so that when the King did return, he would be forced to ally himself with the most powerful Baron.  As a result, the most powerful Baron would hold influence over the King, which could be used to punish the other Barons.<br/><br/>The Barons of Fyn starts with King Timothy leaving Fyn, and each player becoming one of the Barons who will fight it out for ultimate power.  By expanding his frontiers, each Baron will build new villages, towns, and cities, which are loyal only to him.  These villages, towns, and cities, then allow each Baron to build ever bigger armies with which the Baron can go conquering.

Using a unique movement system that forces players to deal with momentum, and a fast and simple combat system, LNL is a great addition to the space game genre.<br/><br/>The game involves combat between the Moon and Earth, with individual ships represented by each counter.  Each side has from 3-8 ships.  Each ship has a log covering armament, fuel, engines and defence.  These logs are reminiscent or the Task Force Game 'Starfire', but have fewer options, but a more sophisticated layout.<br/><br/>The heart of the game is a vector-momentum system (like the one in Yaquinto's Shooting Stars or SPI's Vector Three).  Ships have a facing, use fuel to thrust towards the current facing, but speeds carry over from turn to turn.  Therefore ships can only decelerate only by turning and thrusting in the opposite direction of travel.  Speed is marked by placing numbered counters in the relevant direction.<br/><br/>Combat involves the use of missiles, guns (i.e. projectile weapons) and lasers.  Missiles are launched and move much like ships.  They are more manoeuvrable, but have a limited amount of fuel, used for acceleration and turning.  As a defence ships may have point defence weapons.  Guns and lasers are ranged weapons, with different arcs of fire, but essentially the same resolution.  Damage is assessed by throwing the requisite number of dice - any dice will do, or  even coins - the game using an EOR (even/odds randomiser) - with odd rolls yielding a hit.  Damage is then marked off the ship, with the affected area depending on the side through which fire was taken.<br/><br/>Each side (Moon and Earth) has a choice of 8 types of ships and 5 basic scenarios are available, each with a great deal of flexibility.  Tactics can be involved and subtle.  The  interplay of weapon types makes this an exciting game.

The blocks are stacked in a tower formation; each story is three blocks placed adjacent to each other along their long side, and each story is placed perpendicular to the previous (so, for example, if the blocks in the first story are pointing north-south, the second story blocks will point east-west). There are therefore 18 stories to the Jenga tower. Since stacking the blocks neatly can be tedious, a plastic loading tray is included.<br/><br/>Once the tower is built, the person who built the tower moves first. Moving in Jenga consists of taking one and only one block from any story except the completed top story of the tower at the time of the turn, and placing it on the topmost story in order to complete it. Only one hand at a time may be used to remove a block; both hands can be used, but only one hand may be on the tower at a time. Blocks may be bumped to find a loose block that will not disturb the rest of the tower. Any block that is moved out of place may be left out of place if it is determined that it will knock the tower over if it is removed. The turn ends when the next person to move touches the tower, although he or she can wait 10 seconds before moving for the previous turn to end if they believe the tower will fall in that time.<br/><br/>The game ends when the tower falls in any significant way -- in other words, any piece falls from the tower, other than the piece being knocked out to move to the top. The loser is the person who made the tower fall (i.e. whose turn it was when the tower fell); the winner is the person who moved before the loser.<br/><br/>The same game concept was published in 1984 by Fagus under the name &quot;Hoppla - eins zuviel!&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Cayro Juegos Spanish/English edition", "Chad Valley edition 2008", "Early Learning Centre Edition", "English edition", "English/French edition", "Full Base Union Enterprises Co., Ltd. edition", "Fundex edition 2004", "Fundex English edition 2009", "Grow edition", "Gr\u00fcne Punkt vorsichtig edition", "Hasbro Classic English Edition 2012", "Hasbro Classic multilingual edition 2012", "Hasbro Orange Tube edition 2011", "Hasbro vintage edition 2008", "Hasbro/Milton Bradley version 1996", "Ikea Promotional Edition", "Irwin edition 1984", "Irwin edition 1989", "John Jaques of London edition", "Klee edition", "Lagoon Games edition 1994", "MB Spiele / Hasbro edition 1993", "Milton Bradley Edition 1993", "Milton Bradley US edition 1986", "Milton Bradley/Hasbro edition 2000", "Onyx Edition", "Paradigm Games edition", "Parker Brothers Dutch Edition 2009", "Parker Brothers International Edition", "Parker Brothers Travel edition", "Parker Scandinavian edition 2003", "Pavilion Edition", "Queen German edition 1994", "Salco red edition", "Siam Mandalay edition 2011", "Simba Multilingual edition", "Tactic Multilingual \"Collection Classique\" edition", "Tesco edition", "Tomy Japanese edition", "USAopoly edition 2011", "USAopoly National Park edition", "WWF Edition"], "average": "5.55114", "name": "Jenga", "videogamebg": ["Jenga"], "playingtime": "20", "age": "6", "usersrated": "7395", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Party Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["3D Games", "Characters: Hello Kitty", "Characters: Tarzan", "Jenga", "Promotional Board Games"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["25 \u2013 The Family Gamers Podcast \u2013 Solo play", "Episode 17: Restaurant Voices", "Episode 4 - The Great Outdoors", "GSL024-Stacking", "TPGC - Episode #23 - Jenga and Space Invaders Jenga"]}, "2453": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2197702.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Blokus Trigon", "The Strategy Game"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Bernard Tavitian"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2000", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Alan D.

The only caveat to placing a piece is that it may not lie adjacent to your other pieces, but instead must be placed touching at least one corner of your pieces already on the board.<br/><br/>There is a solitaire variation where one player tries to get rid of all the pieces in a single sitting.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>Blokus Game Board (400 squares)<br/>84 game pieces (four 21-piece sets of red, green, blue, and yellow)<br/>Each color inlcudes:<br/><br/>     1 one-square piece<br/>     1 piece with 2 squares<br/>     2 pieces with 3 squares<br/>     5 pieces with 4 squares<br/>     12 pieces with 5 squares<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Goal of the Game:<br/><br/>Each player has to fit as many of his/her 21 pieces on the board as possible.<br/><br/>How to Play:<br/>1.  Each player chooses a color and places that set of 21 pieces in front of his/her side of the board.  The order of play is as follows: blue, yellow, red, and then green.<br/><br/>2.  The first player (blue) places any of his/her pieces in a corner square.  Play proceeds clockwise around the board (yellow, red, and green), each player putting their first piece down in one of the corner squares.<br/><br/>3.  Play continues as each player lays down one piece during a turn.<br/><br/>Each new piece must touch at least one other piece of the same color, but only at the corners.<br/><br/>No flat edges of same color pieces can touch.<br/><br/>There are no restrictions on how pieces of different colors can touch one another.<br/><br/>4.  Whenever a player is unable to place one of his/her remaining pieces on the board, that player must pass his/her turn.<br/><br/>End of Game:<br/>The game ends when all players are blocked from laying down any more of their pieces.  This also includes any players who may have placed all of their pieces on the board.  Scores are tallied, and the player with the highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>Scoring:<br/>Each player counts the number of unit squares in his/her remaining pieces (1 unit square = -1 point).<br/><br/>A player earns +15 points if all his/her pieces have been placed on the board plus 5 additional bonus points if the last piece placed on the board was the smallest piece (one square).<br/><br/>There are unauthorized versions of the game published under various names, including The Strategy Game, Tetris, Blok&aacute;d (unofficial Hungarian version with cardboard pieces) and The Family Chess Game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Alary Canadian edition", "Alary Canadian edition 2000", "Alary Multi-lingual edition with 3 awards", "Beverly Japanese edition", "dan-spil First Scandinavian edition", "Divisible By Zero Australian Edition 2005", "Educational Insights \"Most Celebrated Game\" edition with 4 awards", "Educational Insights edition 2003", "Educational Insights edition with 4 awards", "Educational Insights English edition 2005", "Educational Insights Giant edition", "Educational Insights StrataGems edition 2005", "Euro World Spanish/Portuguese edition", "Foxmind Hebrew edition", "Granna Polish edition", "Green Board Game Co. edition", "Hodin Dutch version with award logos", "Kaissa Greek edition", "Mattel American Girl Doll edition", "Mattel English edition 2008", "Mattel English edition 2009", "Mattel English edition 2013", "Mattel multilingual edition 2013", "Mattel multilingual EN/IT/PR/SP edition 2008", "Mattel multilingual NE/FR/DE/IT edition 2008", "Mattel Nordic edtion 2008", "Mattel Russian edition 2013", "Mattel Scandinavian multi-lingual edition", "Mattlel English/French edition 2013", "Piatnik multi-lingual edition 2000", "QfreeGames edition", "Ravensburger Spanish/Portuguese edition", "Sekkoia edition", "Sekkoia German first edition 2000", "Sekkoia Multi-lingual edition with 2 awards", "Winning Moves France multilingual edition", "Winning Moves French edition", "Winning Moves German second edition 2005", "Winning Moves Giant edition"], "average": "6.94414", "name": "Blokus", "videogamebg": ["Blokus", "Blokus World Tour"], "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Enclosure", "Tile Placement"], "age": "5", "usersrated": "16757", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Blokus Series", "Combinatorial", "Mensa Select", "Polyominoes", "Solitaire Games"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["11-30-15: Thanksgaming!

On each lease, you must decide whether to go for shallow or deep wells --once a well has been drilled, even a dry hole, all future drilling must be done at the same depth, even if the lease changes hands.  The first few wells are Exploratory and have lesser chances of success; once a producing well has been drilled, further drilling is Developmental.

It's your job to ward off this threat before it's too late.<br/>Published in 1983, the Zaxxon Board Game was one of Milton Bradley&rsquo;s numerous attempts to translate video games to board games.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY THE GAME: <br/>1. ROLLING THE DIE: both players roll their die AT THE SAME TIME. Reroll the die if there is a tie. On EACH turn, the player rolling the Lower Number on the die ALWAYS plays first. Then the player rolling the Higher Number plays second. <br/>2. USING THE SPINNER: the player rolling the Lower Number spins the spinner. The spinner controls enemy fire directed at fighter planes from missile silos and gun turrets (later in the game the spinner will also control the movement of Zaxxon). When RED is spun, any plane that is in or enters a missile silo area CONTAINING A MISSILE SILO is shot down and returned to its home base. When BLUE is spun, any plane that is in a gun turret area CONTAINING A GUN TURRET is shot down and returned to its home base. If a missile silo or a gun turret has been shot and removed from the board, there is no enemy fire from that area so any planes in that area are safe. Notice that the missile silo areas are surrounded by a red border and the gun turret areas are surrounded by a blue border. See Figures 5A and 5B for locations. When WHITE is spun, all planes are safe. Please Note: if your plane is shot down by a missile silo or gun turret in the inner fortress, return it to a RESTART space in your outer fortress. <br/>3. ORDER OF PLAY: after spinning the spinner, the player who rolled the Lower Number moves his or her plane or planes according to the die count just rolled. Then the player who rolled the Higher Number moves his or her plane or planes according to the die count just rolled. You can move one of your planes the full amount on the die or move both of your planes, splitting the die count between them in any combination<br/>4. HOW A FIGHTER PLANE MOVES: a fighter plane can move from one space to any adjacent space by die count as shown in Figure 6. A plane can change direction or land on the same space more than once on the same turn. A plane cannot pass over or land on a space occupied by another plane. A fighter plane can &quot;fly&quot; at High Altitude or Low Altitude by raising or lowering it on its base. Each change in altitude (either High to Low or Low to High) counts as ONE on your die count. Your plane must be at Low Altitude to shoot a target and at High Altitude to cross a wall.<br/><br/>HOW TO WIN THE GAME: <br/>Be the first player to destroy your enemy targets and shoot Zaxxon with both of your fighter planes.<br/><br/>"}, "2483": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic69149.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Allen Hammack"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1982", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["James Holloway"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Encore (for boardgames)", "TSR"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic69149_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Fantasy", "Medieval", "Mythology", "Wargame"], "description": "A wargame simulating the battle of Ragnar&ouml;k between Odin and the other Gods of Asgard and Loki and the Forces of Chaos.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Encore Polish Edition", "TSR English Edition"], "average": "6.01402", "name": "Viking Gods", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Simulation", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "107", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["TSR Minigames", "Vikings"]}, "2484": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic335384.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["O.
