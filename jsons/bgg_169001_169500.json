This small farming village is but the first step to total victory.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The Hamlet is a large-scale map of a farming village. Scale is each one inch/square/hex is approximately 10 to 15 feet. This map can be used as the layout of a village for use in a fantasy game or it could be used as the site of a large-scale or mass combat battle. The Hamlet includes a 360-degree panoramic view of the Hamlet from a perspective as if standing in the northern part of the village.<br/><br/>The Hamlet is intended for use in fantasy, historical, and modern games (adding some farm machinery can make it feel more modern or it could be a farming community than shuns such technology like the Amish).<br/><br/>The major terrain feature of the hamlet is a river that varies from 10-30 feet (depending on the scale decided upon) in width spanned by five wooden bridges (two in the north, one in the center, and two in the south parts of the river). These wooden bridges are likely able to support wagons, horses, etc., but might strain under the weight of heavy vehicles such as tanks. Most of the hamlet is on the western bank with some houses and fields on the eastern bank north and south of the main village. In any type of conflict, controlling these bridges will be crucial to preventing the enemy from crossing the river and entering the main hamlet in the center of the map.<br/><br/>This terrain feature allows you to designate two zones for deployment, the defender&rsquo;s zone in the western bank and an attacker&rsquo;s zone in the eastern bank. The defenders need to stop the attackers from breaking through to the western edge of the map to win and the attackers need to overrun the hamlet and breakthrough to the other side to win.<br/><br/>Some example scenarios could be the Allies set up on the western side with German forces attacking them from across the Rur River during the Battle of the Bulge. Or the Germans are set up on the western side of the hamlet with the Russians crossing the Oder River as they approach Berlin. Heavily armored vehicles like tanks crossing will sink the bridges, but lighter vehicles like trucks, jeeps, and lightly armored scouts can make it across. Field engineers who can erect a metal bridge might also be of great importance to the attackers to establish a route to get heavy tanks and tank destroyers across the river.

It is a game of stellar exploration, planetary investigation, starship battles, diplomacy, crafting, commodity trading, and much, much more, all set in a totally procedurally generated infinite universe. In layman's terms this means that with each game an entirely new universe is created, allowing for unlimited replayability.<br/><br/>Gameplay is highly approachable, with Approaching Infinity taking on the tropes of what makes a &quot;classic&quot; rogue-like game while infusing the game with a modern, player focused commitment. Beautiful retro-visuals provided by David Gervais (known for his various rogue-like tilesets, along with other science-fiction titles), and immersive music by Nathan Becker aka 'ectogemia', transport players into Approaching Infinity's realm. Control can be mouse or keyboard. An intelligent interaction system allows players to focus on gameplay and not a multitude of commands.<br/><br/>Approaching Infinity's nods to classic rogue-like play includes permadeath, procedurally generated environments (with over thirty different generation algorithms), random creatures, items, and quests. Artifacts must be identified and there is a ticking oxygen clock for away missions. Yet, thanks to the ability to turn permadeath off, the ease of play, helpful tooltips, and more, this is a player's rogue-like game; a game of endless adventure, a game of 'one more turn'.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Approaching Infinity is about your story amongst the inky darkness of a bejeweled galaxy. Tell it the way you want it told. Be the gruff but lovable space pirate, the alpha leader who personally puts him or herself in danger, the wide eyed explorer who simply wants to absorb the beauty of creation.

The twelve scenarios cover actions from 1939 to 1944 with each of the combatants in the Combat Commander Series represented in at least one scenario.  The Tournament Guidelines Booklet contains the preferred rules the designer uses to implement and run tournaments at the World Boardgaming Championships and the PrezCon Game Convention.

It is driven by macabre stories of a world gone mad and features adventure, politics and economics to deliver an unlimited sandbox experience. Each game the variables change: cards, player interactions, stories, strategies and threats. While the game has a strong pulp influence, its roots stem from Cold War studies. We have expanded upon this research to arrive at our game&rsquo;s premise: What would happen after a nuclear and biological apocalypse?<br/><br/>Our answer is Fallen Land. As a player, you are the leader of a unique faction of survivors competing for primacy in the ruinous aftermath of post-apocalyptic America. You must manage and enhance your town, protect your citizens and secure resources. You will also have to make and break treaties to endure, amidst a myriad of bribery and betrayal by the other players. But that is just where the adventure begins! You must also direct your agents (a party of characters), to explore the rugged landscape, establish your territory and solidify your agenda.<br/><br/>Game play is comprised of Turns. Each represents one month and is divided into Phases and Sub-Phases. The First Player resolves each Phase and Sub-Phase followed clockwise by the other players, before proceeding to the next Phase or Sub-Phase. A Turn is over when all players have had the opportunity to act or pass on each Phase.<br/><br/>I. Effects Phase *<br/>    1.) Resolve.<br/><br/>II. Town Business Phase *<br/>    1.) Deal.<br/>    2.) Resource Production.<br/>    3.) Auction House.<br/>    4.) Roll 1d10 on Town Events Chart.<br/>    5.) Financial period.<br/>        ~Sell.<br/>        ~Purchase.<br/>        ~Hire (NPCMs).<br/><br/>III. Party Exploits Phase *<br/>    1.) NPCMs move.<br/>    2.) Choose Party Exploits (4 weeks to spend).    <br/>        ~Movement, spend 1 week.<br/>        ~Encounter, spend 1 week.<br/>        ~PVP, spend 1 week.<br/>        ~Resource, spend 2 weeks.<br/>        ~Healing, spend 2 weeks.<br/>        ~Mission, spend 3 weeks.<br/><br/>IV. End Turn Phase *<br/>    1.) Adjust Turn Marker.<br/>    2.) Pass the First Player Sheet.<br/><br/><br/>    Resolve an Action Card in each Phase or Sub-Phase as directed by the card.<br/><br/><br/>A player's town is simulated by a Town Play Mat. Players organize their owned Resources, inventory, Party Characters, excess Characters and movement bonuses here. In addition, Town Play Mats can be upgraded three different ways: Town Defense Chips, Town Technologies and Action Cards. The first two upgrades are available for purchase during the Town Business Phase. However, Action Cards are dealt at the beginning of each Turn and are also drawn as a reward.<br/><br/>    Players also manage their Party consisting of five Character Cards. Characters may be equipped with gear (Spoils Cards), to increase their Base Skills. A party can move around the map, draw Encounter and Mission cards (stories) which contain Skill Checks (challenges) and even attack another player's Party in PVP. Dice are rolled for these many &quot;deeds&quot; to determine the outcome. <br/> There are seven decks of cards. These are drawn and played throughout the game. Some are stories, such as Encounter and Mission Cards, Characters are a Faction's agents, and Spoils are equipment/vehicle/gear. Lastly, Action Cards modify the story and/or game play.<br/><br/>To win, one of two Victory Conditions is necessary, either 20 Prestige or 80 Town Health. Prestige represents your reputation as a leader, while Town Health represents your town&rsquo;s prosperity and number of its citizens. Both conditions are marked on their respective Victory Tracks bordering the map.<br/><br/>Adventure and intrigue await!

In an instant, you are flung into the depths, and the few peaceful moments of weightlessness before splashing into the water below are the last you will have. You are Theseus, son of Poseidon, here to kill the rampaging horror that is the Minotaur. You will either succeed in the slaughter or learn the true meaning of fear trying.<br/><br/>Depths of Fear :: Knossos, like Athena from Zeus, sprang forth from the mind of the musically trained animator/programmer Philip Wiley.

Loot procedurally generated labyrinths that are never the same twice to acquire the gold and knowledge necessary to build an arsenal and gain favor with the gods who will grant you temporary powers.

We decided to change that.  In Feats Reforged, feats scale in ability as you do, so that their level of ability matches your own.<br/><br/>Many of the so-called &ldquo;worthless&rdquo; feats have now been reforged, so that their abilities are on par with other feats, and each feat now scales in ability with their users.<br/><br/>You will find that most feats now also have an additional bonus effect at around 7th, 14th and sometimes even 20th level.  This represents your increase in skill with these feats and talents.<br/><br/>In addition, these feats are an excellent resource if you play in a low magic setting.  You can focus on allowing the players to be the heroes, relying on their own abilities, rather than focusing on the magic items they carry.<br/><br/>Every feat should remain viable, at every level.<br/><br/>Inside Feats Reforged, Volume III, you will find hundreds of reforged feats from the &quot;Big Hardback Combat Book&quot; by Paizo Publishing.  With these new variations of the classic feats you will find much more utility and benefit, even after leveling past their initial value.

It is my hope that this document helps you remain and participate, and contribute to it.<br/><br/>By the way, my most enjoyable fan moment with Traveller: shortly after I did the very first version of this, I discovered a large package in my box.

It should come as no surprise, then, that wizards, witches, and other powerful spellcasters are always on the lookout for new and exciting spells to add to their repertoires. While many spells from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook received a facelift and an upgrade in Mythic Adventures, the sourcebook that introduced mythic power to the game of Pathfinder, dozens of spells were left behind. Missing Mythic Magic Volume XII, and its predecessors, aim to give each and every spell from the core rules a full-fledged mythic upgrade, all the way from A to Z, with a special focus on making mythic spells that feel as over-the-top and larger-than-life as possible.<br/><br/>This installment includes 23 mythic spells, from incendiary cloud to locate object. A mythic insect plague not only summons more swarms, but also allows the caster to summon swarms of far more powerful creatures, including hellwasp swarms. A mythic invisibility purge punishes creatures that it strips invisibility from, inflicting severe damage on them, while a mythic know direction not only functions in places without a true North, but can also provide the direction of major geographical features.

In every game, you select devious plots and challenge your opponents on the field of battle, through back alley intrigue, and in the political arena. Whether you play a against a single opponent, in a game known as a joust, or engage in a battle of three or more players, called a melee, winning challenges against your opponents is the way to victory.<br/><br/>Your ultimate goal in A Game of Thrones: The Card Game is to gain influence over the greatest seat of power in Westeros: the Iron Throne! To achieve this goal, you must call upon iconic characters, such as Tywin Lannister, Robb Stark, Stannis Baratheon, Daenerys Targaryen, Euron Crow's Eye, The Red Viper, and dozens of others. You must maneuver the members of your House and your allies in a constant battle to gain power. The first player to claim fifteen power wins!<br/><br/>In the game, each player has two decks: a draw deck and a plot deck. Your draw deck contains the tactical elements of your struggle, including the characters, locations, attachments, and events that you call upon in your struggle to claim the Iron Throne. You can command characters from throughout A Song of Ice and Fire, and you can march forth from the icy walls of Winterfell or muster your armies around Casterly Rock. You may even equip your characters with storied weapons, such as the Valyrian steel blades Ice or Widow's Wail. The draw deck holds these powerful characters, locations, attachments, and events. This deck is randomly shuffled and players draw their hands from this deck.<br/><br/>At the start of each round, each player simultaneously chooses and reveals one of the plot cards from their individual seven-card plot decks. Your plot for a round determines how much gold you can spend on cards, which player starts with initiative, and how powerful your challenges are. Your plot also bears a reserve value, which determines how many cards you can keep in your hand past the end of the round. Plots may also offer powerful effects that can trigger when the plots are revealed or persist to shape the entire game round. You may scorch the earth with a deadly wildfire assault, or call upon all players to support the faith of the Seven.<br/><br/>A Game of Thrones: The Card Game (Second Edition) differs from the first edition of the game due to elements being cut, elements being revised or updated, and elements being added. Influence was a holdover from the game's origin as a CCG and is now unnecessary, while crests offered nothing to distinguish them from traits and made the game more difficult for new players to learn. Existing keywords have been pruned, and some new keywords have been added to showcase the most interesting and essential interactions.<br/><br/>The timing rules &mdash; such as the details of moribund, passive effects with triggers, and save/cancel responses &mdash; will be replaced with a more straightforward timing system that takes advantage of the Interrupt, Reaction, and Forced triggers that have been successfully employed in some of FFG's newer LCGs.<br/><br/>The second edition also includes two new factions beyond the six Houses in the first edition. New deck-building rules empower players with more options in combining factions, alongside a means of building more focused and specialized plot decks.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Czech first edition", "English first edition", "French second edition", "German first edition", "Italian first edition", "Polish first edition", "Spanish first edition"], "average": "7.90972", "name": "A Game of Thrones: The Card Game (Second Edition)", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": ["227881", "226880", "225567", "217960", "194198", "218983", "196619", "191236", "200634", "212312", "224754", "201277", "185060", "179601", "182995", "181458", "204029", "193060", "218174", "189169"], "usersrated": "2273", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Customizable Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["CCGs (Collectible Card Games)", "A Game of Thrones LCG", "Living Card Game", "A Song of Ice and Fire"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BGA Ep 83 - Top Ten Games that Bumped Other Games from Our Shelves", "BGA Episode 100 - Top 100 Games of All Time", "Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 017 \u2013 Our Podcast Subscriptions", "Ep 4 - Asymmetrical Games", "Episode 20: TatterCon 2015!", "Episode 31 - Our Top 20 of All-Time", "Episode 6 - Our GenCon 2015 Preview and Twilight Struggle Review", "Episode 61- Pandemic Legacy and Jeremy Hot Seat (Spoiler Free)", "HLG 1: De Start", "Season 3, Episode 0 (Bonus)", "Season 3, Episode 1", "Season 3, Episode 10", "Season 3, Episode 11", "Season 3, Episode 12", "Season 3, Episode 13", "Season 3, Episode 14", "Season 3, Episode 2", "Season 3, Episode 3", "Season 3, Episode 4", "Season 3, Episode 5", "Season 3, Episode 6", "Season 3, Episode 6", "Season 3, Episode 7", "Season 3, Episode 8", "Season 3, Episode 9", "Strange Assembly 184 - In With The Old, In With The New", "Strange Assembly 205 - 2016 Wrap-Up", "The Game Pit - Episode 56 - The Bumper Review of 2015 (with Top 5s)", "The Game Pit: Episode 40 - Council Chamber Mega Review of 2014 with Top 5s", "The Good The Board and The Jerks That Went to GenCon: Episode 78 \u201cGenCon Reviews\u201d", "The Good The Board and The Joe Likes Space Alert Way Too Much: Episode 77 \u201cProgramming Games\u201d", "The Good, The Board and The Anticipated: Episode 55 \u201cGames to play in 2016\u2033", "The Good, The Board and The Committed:  Episode 54 \u201cLong Games\u201d", "The Good, The Board and The Pretties: Episode 45 \u201cMiniatures\u201d", "The Good, The Board and The \u201cMombaaaasssaaaaa\u201d: Episode 52 \u201cBest of 2015\u2033", "The White Book S6E1- 211", "The White Book S6E11- 221", "The White Book S6E12- 222", "The White Book S6E13- 223", "The White Book S6E14- 224", "The White Book S6E2- 212", "The White Book S6E3- 213", "The White Book S6E4- 214", "The White Book S6E5- 215", "The White Book S6E6- 216", "The White Book S6E7- 217", "The White Book S6E8- 218", "The White Book S6E9- 219", "The White Book S6E9- 220", "The White Book S7E01- 225", "The White Book S7E02- 226", "What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing Week 46!!!", "What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing Week 48!!!

The earth decays, collapsing into a network of abysses.  The wilderness thickens.<br/><br/>It has been nine years since That Day when it all started.  Pockets of humanity still exist, but are ignorant of one another.  Within these isolated havens people try to live as best they can &mdash; for even in a world so broken and dark, daily life must go on.<br/><br/>Darrell and Mary Williams were able to build such a life inside a five-acre fenced yard out in the country.  They were even secure enough in their isolated compound that they had a daughter five years after the zombie-like grays appeared.<br/><br/>Life carried on as normally as it could, until another refugee on the run is killed during a nearby attack.

The game was released on the Steam platform for the PC on March 24, 2014. Set in colonial Virginia in the 17th century, the game includes stealth elements, with players stalking their enemies and using colonial weaponry to defeat them.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Betrayer is a stealth horror action-adventure played from a first-person perspective. It uses a monochrome art style that Eurogamer\u200a'\u200bs Dan Whitehead described as &quot;undeniably striking&quot;.[2] The game has no clear missions or markers for quest objectives, aiming to initially perplex players by not providing a defined sense of direction. Sound plays a central role in exploring the game world, as it is used to lead the player to clues and other points of interest. While progressing, any clues found are meticulously documented in the inventory windows. Similar to The Elder Scrolls series, players can quickly navigate from one location to another by clicking a point-of-interest icon on the game's map.<br/><br/>In the game, players stealthily kill enemy conquistadors by creeping through tall grass and hiding their movements by timing them with strong gusts of wind. Enemies are killed using a variety of antiquated weaponry including bows, crossbows, pistols, muskets, and thrown tomahawks. Taking inspiration from Dark Souls, when the player dies in the game all of their items are left on their corpse at the location of death. The player then respawns at the base fort and must journey back to where they died to retrieve their items from their corpse. If the player dies again before retrieving their items, then the items on that first corpse will disappear and can not be recovered.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Betrayer (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "169289": {"rpgdesigner": ["Lawson Bennett", "Jimm Johnson"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing (Lulu)", "PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Dungeon Module UR1: The Tomb of the Sea Kings", "rpgartist": ["Lawson Bennett", "Jill Bennett", "Mitch Crawford", "Jimm Johnson", "Bill Lackey", "Jorge Molina"], "rpgproducer": ["Nathan Jennings", "Jimm Johnson"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2311023.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "average": "8.5", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["AD&D First Edition (1e) Compatible Products", "Basic D&D Compatible Product", "Original D&D Compatible Products"], "rpgpublisher": ["The Scribes of Sparn"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2311023_t.jpg", "description": "From the back cover:<br/>After a successful plunder of the Urchinn Isles, a well deserved night of drinking is in order, during such you trade stories with a local &quot;antique dealer&quot; who tells of a well-financed acquaintance who is organizing an archeological dig.

The very nature of the game means that spells, and spellcasting, work a certain way. While there are plenty of spells to choose from, eventually you reach a point where just casting the same old things over and over again gets boring. And that&rsquo;s where the books in the Advanced Arcana series come in.<br/><br/>Advanced Arcana Volume V is more than just a collection of 120 brand new, never-before-seen spells. It, like its critically-acclaimed predecessors, was specifically designed to challenge the status quo of the way that magic works in your game. Previous installments of Advanced Arcana have created spells with different effects when cast at different spell levels, spells that modify other spells, and spells which blurred the lines between the schools of magic. This installment turns its eyes to the idea of spells with a mind of their own, in an attempt to create magic that feels more mysterious, out of control, and, ultimately, magical. In this book you will find spells whose effect depends on the roll of a die, spells that are more or less effective depending on the whims of your magical patron, spells that can be cast only when a predetermined trigger occurs, and spells that may backfire upon the caster if they are not handled with care, among many other fun and exciting new spells.<br/><br/>But even above and beyond Advanced Arcana Volume V's numerous groundbreaking new spells that will have you rethinking what you thought you knew about magic, the book contains a number of expansive appendices on such topics as&hellip;<br/><br/>    &hellip;a selection of feats that allow casters to make the most of the new spell mechanics.<br/>    &hellip;traits for familiars, giving them more personality as well as mechanical customization.<br/>    &hellip;a mini-bestiary of new sentient spells, containing 17 creatures from CR 4 to 20.<br/>    &hellip;and more!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>If you&rsquo;ve already experienced one of the previous installments of Advanced Arcana, you know that this book is not to be missed.

The very word evokes mental pictures of brave knights rescuing fair maidens from high towers, dark dungeons, or dastardly dragons. But all those stories seems to focus on ladies in the role, seemingly too weak to handle their own affairs. The modern women I know would never need rescue. They would give those witches, evildoers, and dragons a piece of their mind and likely more if the situation called for it. Waiting for rescue? Not in their repertoire.<br/><br/>But it's one of those repeated story lines in many adventures. Rescuing a lost child, a missing animal, a group of wayward adults... the list goes on.<br/><br/>Sometimes we need one of those folks in distress and don't quite know how they got there or what situation to relate.

I might play it into:<br/><br/>&quot;The Mines of Moro have been abandoned for years on the outskirts of the Kingdom. The dwarves long ago discovered something deep and fled, warning others away from the area. They said they had contained it, but that was years ago. Nobody had thought of it since.<br/><br/>That was before the echoes began. At first, it was just those few settlements closest to the mines who reported the strange howling. As those spread to the capitol, the authorities began to take notice. It was affecting the sleep of the royal family. <br/><br/>A member of the Kingsguard led a small unit into the mines three weeks ago and the echoes stopped, though they never returned. Last night, the echoes began again.<br/><br/>When the royal wizard spoke with the shade of the Kingsguard, he realized what danger the kingdom truly faced. The dwarves had scratched the barrier to the Fell Hall, a space within the world thought to house the lesser demons serving Hel. These creatures would do anything to escape but are wasted beyond the ability to communicate clearly. Instead, the demon wail drives mortals mad. Whatever barrier the dwarves had put into place had worn away and was needing to be replaced.<br/><br/>The wizard has summoned your party and given you detailed instructions on how to replace the barrier.

An adept onmy\u014dji is in touch with the natural world, as well as the spirits that tend to it. Historically, onmy\u014dji were retained by rulers and other decision makers to help ensure that all festivals and other holidays fell on lucky days, as well as in an advisory role regarding policy.

In order to successfully launch products, you must develop the necessary infrastructure while keeping an eye on external events, which might help or hinder your efforts.<br/><br/>Launch &amp; Iterate is a turn based cooperative card game. Tech cards are the primary type of card used in the game. Tech cards enable development of either core infrastructure (e.g. Data Redundancy), or offer one-shot benefits (e.g. Refactor). Tech cards are also used as the primary currency in the game, representing engineering effort required to develop new technology or to contribute to launching new products.<br/><br/>During the game, players focus on launching 1 or (potentially) more products at any given time. Successfully launching products increases the overall user base (in millions of users) and allows players to shift effort onto new products. Players attempt to maximize the total user base by the end of the game by strategically selecting the right products to work on at the right time. Each product has specific infrastructure requirements which must be met, along with a cost (in Tech cards) which must be contributed by players in order to successfully launch the product.<br/><br/>On their turn, players may select a Tech card to play from their hand (making sure that all requirements and costs are met), contribute any number of Tech cards from their hand to help launch an active product, and draw new card(s). At the end of each round, players reveal the next Event card, which can either deliver a benefit or incur a penalty, depending on the card as well as the infrastructure levels players have developed. The game is over after 11 events have been resolved.<br/><br/>A key factor in Launch &amp; Iterate is developing infrastructure across 4 critical technology stacks, (F)eatures, (A)ccessibility, (S)torage, and (T)esting. Each stack is built up over the course of the game, from base level 0 to level 7. Developing infrastructure is critical to successfully launching products, but usually doesn't directly affect the user base. Each stack also offers specific benefits at higher levels, such as reducing or negating negative Event effects, increasing user base, enabling better allocation of resources or increasing development capabilities.<br/><br/>"}, "169425": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2481872.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Chase Layman", "Sean Layman"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Michael Anderson (II)", "Alain Viesca", "Chris Yarbrough"], "boardgamepublisher": ["World of Rivals LLC"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2481872_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Miniatures", "Nautical"], "description": "IN THE DEEPEST OF THE DEEP SEAS...<br/><br/>lies the Lurk.

Players take on the roles of Defenders of the last known haven for humanity, called The Last Stand. Four outside clans leaders, along with their followers, advance toward the town, and players work cooperatively to defend The Last Stand.  Menacing mutants also roam the desert threatening the city's survival. The game will introduce player character mutations - your character can mutate from travel into irradiated areas. Gameplay will consist of both elements of adventure and conflict resolution, and Defenders of the Last Stand will come loaded with miniatures, including three large sculpted miniatures of the invading Clan leaders as well as their minions - sculpted by Chad Hoverter. The four warrior clans include raiders on bikes and in cars, another group of human amazons that ride large mutated beasts, a third clan consisting of techno savvy, yet criminally insane youths, and finally a large winged creature so mutated that he has lost all traces of his old humanity.<br/><br/>&quot;Today we discovered a fallen caravan not fifteen miles up dry road. I had been that way to visit Auntie's just recently and there weren't no caravans, fallen or otherwise, there before. This means the Raiders have been circling the last stand for at least the last two weeks. Pepzi asked me to stay a while in case they attack. No more scavenging for now, she said. &quot;Something is brewing. The air hurts my lungs. I see shadows in the hillside.&quot; The air is more dry than usual. My lips have all but cracked off. Doc gives me salve to put on them, but I tell him to keep it for the kids. New families are appearing in Stanfield. It's a good sight to see. We are finally surviving a bit, and bringing kids into this world again. I'm thinking of how in the good book we are told to be multiply. It's God's will, but most would say this land has been forsaken by God, but I'm hoping we can start again. Me, I'm hoping for the best, but my bones tell me there is no best.<br/><br/>&quot;The Last Stand was known as Stanfield back in the old world, before the great war. While battles raged in the cities across America and the world, as far as we know, some old-schoolers, cowboys, fighters, and drifters came together in this desert to escape the end of the world. The desert was only the safe place and Detroit says it's where a man learns to be a man. Detroit told me that Stanfield changed its name to The Last Stand back then. Cause it was the last fighting chance for humanity. Detroit knows lots of stories. He is old and claims he was alive in those days, 80 something years ago, back when they played something called baseball and Nitena. I don't know what to believe from his mouth, but he is a hoot to listen to. Course, he has been around a long time, changed by the Radiation &ndash; mutated like many folks, but still as human as human can be,  unlike the raiders. Detroit is one of us now. He knows stuff and and we are going to fight tooth and nail against the raiders wanting to take what we worked so hard to build. Rumor is that they have merged, and I reckon they will have to to capture this city. We are bonded together. Even got a little ancient technology and oil. Bad stuff maybe since it is what brought us here. We'll use it carefully.  The Last Stand may be our last hope.  I don't know if there are any other cities out there worth fighting for.&quot;<br/>--Taken from the Journal of Marha Bourne Star<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "7.79455", "name": "Defenders of the Last Stand", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Point to Point Movement", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "14", "usersrated": "297", "boardgameaccessory": ["Defenders of the Last Stand: Custom Dice"], "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BGA Ep 71 - How to: Teach a Board Game", "Dukes of Dice - Ep. 40 - When Colts Cry", "RDTN Episode 92: Midnight Train to Georgia \u2013 CMON Expo, Eric Lang, Rodney Smith and Action Phase Games", "Vox Republica 091: Arkham\u2019s Finest - An Interview with Richard Launius", "Vox Republica 139: Con Budgets"]}, "169465": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2618260.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Werewolf"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Michel Fischman"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "26", "boardgameartist": ["Fernando Marecos"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Bureau De Juegos"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2618260_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Party Game"], "description": "From the Spanish rulebook:<br/>In Shinobi, a group of deadly Shinobi must infiltrate a village and murder all its villagers.<br/><br/>During the NIGHT the Shinobi attack from the shadows.

The process of merely planning and gaining support to make such a risk-filled journey was a difficult path of its own. Yet, in securing the sponsorship of beloved Queen Isabel of Portugal, Raimundo was able to get the supplies and crew needed to accomplish his dream.<br/><br/>Players recreate this accomplishment in a game that plays out as a 3-stage story. First, gather evidence of the hidden land and assemble a plan in order to gain sponsorship from King Dinis, Queen Isabel, the Bishop of Lisbon, or 3 other important figures. Second, use the resources from your sponsor and the help of others to get the supplies and crew needed to make the journey. Finally, sail the treacherous seas to discover the &quot;Land of Danger.&quot;<br/><br/>Gameplay is centered around a deck of multi-use cards that will provide different forms of influence and characters that can provide help. Some cards are drawn secretly, while others are drafted publicly. Players discard cards from their hand to spend influence, which gains the help from the characters on other cards. The help may involve providing evidence of the land, plans on how to get there, gaining supplies or crew, etc.<br/><br/>The goal of the first act of the game is to secure the sponsorship of one of six major figures, who each have their own special powers that will provide help in the second and third acts of the game. While the game, ultimately, is a race to be first to get to the Land of Danger, points are also scored for helping others and having the most adventurous trip.<br/><br/>The game is playable solo, and also with 2 to 6 players. Player interaction can be very subtle and primarily consists of impacting the cards available for others to draw or draft, and vying for sponsorship and limited supplies and crew.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "12", "name": "Tales of Danger #1: Days of Discovery", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management"], "average": "6", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Land of Danger"]}, "169494": {"rpgartist": ["Jennifer Bals", "Moritz Honert", "Marcus Lindgren"], "statistics": [], "name": "Cthulhus Ruf (Issue 6 - Nov 2014)", "rpgdesigner": ["Stefan Droste", "Andr\u00e9 Frenzer", "Moritz Honert", "Christoph Maser", "Andreas Melhorn", "Daniel Neugebauer", "Carsten Pohl", "Kaid Ramdani", "Dominik Schwan", "Robert Wintermann"], "rpgproducer": ["Y\u00f6rn Buttelmann", "Stefan Droste", "Melanie Helke", "Frank Heller", "Christoph Maser", "Marc Meiburg", "Daniel Neugebauer"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2319139.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Cthulhus Ruf"], "rpg": ["Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["regular issue 6"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2319139_t.jpg", "description": "(user summary)<br/>issue 6 features war as a theme<br/><br/>table of contents:<br/>preamble<br/>special column &quot;Die Fl&uuml;stert&uuml;te&quot;<br/>&quot;How to do the Gatsby&quot; - archives of a gamemaster<br/>Krieg &amp; Spiel - veterans as PCs<br/>Dunkler Sommer - a scenario for the great war era and the 1920s<br/>Time to go - a scenario for Cthulhu Now<br/>Kampf ums Empire - military service overseas<br/>Die Kolonialausstellung - a site for Gaslight and the 1920s<br/>Ultima Ratio - a scenario set in 1937<br/>Der Fleischer - a tale of terror set after the great war<br/>Geteiltes Leid - a site for the great war era<br/>Bonus - NSC: The Manhunter<br/>NSC if this issue: the drone pilot<br/><br/>"}, "169495": {"rpgdesigner": ["Andr\u00e9 Frenzer"], "statistics": [], "name": "Cthulhus Ruf Archiv (Issue 6 - Nov 2014): Das Geisterhausprojekt", "rpgartist": ["Marc Meiburg", "Tina Wessel"], "rpgproducer": ["Y\u00f6rn Buttelmann", "Stefan Droste", "Frank Heller", "Marc Meiburg", "Daniel Neugebauer"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2319144.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Cthulhus Ruf"], "rpg": ["Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["Cthulhus Ruf Archiv issue 6"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2319144_t.jpg", "description": "(user summary)<br/>This is a mockumentary called &quot;Das Geisterhausprojekt&quot; (The ghost house project)<br/><br/>"}, "169496": {"poll": [], "name": "Achtung Kreuzung: Das neue Verkehrsspiel", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Point to Point Movement", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1948", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Traffic Games"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2316175_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Curt Cowall"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2316175.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Racing"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The players have to move from &quot;Start&quot; to &quot;Ziel&quot;.

You don't have to learn a complicated system, refer to scores of tables, or spend all day creating characters. You can either create custom characters for the game or dive right in with any of the included templates. The game is designed to be light; it has a small footprint and extremely low price tag - it's not overloaded with tons of rules or an excess of information you just won't need. It's meant to get you running quickly so you can have a good time.<br/><br/>The setting is very open. Two centuries after forming the United Sovereign Worlds with the ape-like Digronians, Humanity spearheads peace and freedom in known space. While aliens are commonplace, some are more trusted than others. The bioframe-ridden Migado, insectoid Kt'Sorii, and synthetic X-ans are mankind's newest allies. And while the genetically-flawed Tarkosians are now also allies, many citizens cannot forget or forgive their involvement in the war that prompted the initial need for such alliances. Travel to mysterious destinations, discover new alien species, uncover diabolical plots, and battle space pirates with HardNova 2. The included scenarios immerse you into the setting so even if you don't want to the run them, you've still got a lot of info to work with to flavor your setting or inspire ideas. And if you don't want to use the setting, the rules are flexible enough to handle your own ideas or that of your favorite movie, television program, comic, or novel.<br/><br/>This expanded game compiles the HardNova 2 core book, both Enhancement Packs, Miniseries Alpha: The Vanguard, and Aliens: The Ruthdii in one book, plus includes even more content.<br/><br/>"}, "169498": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Albert Ma"], "average": "4.5", "poll": [], "name": "Hunny Hunters", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Animals: Bears", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2316414_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Jamaika Wong"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["ShroomLab Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2316414.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Bluffing", "Card Game", "Children's Game", "Memory"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "In this game, players take on the role of grizzly bears who are trying to collect their beloved honey. Yet, they can never get their precious without taking some risks. Not only are there furious wasps and bees ready for revenge but also their bear buddies may be casting a covetous eye and trying to snatch each others&rsquo; honey with their bear hands (no pun intended). There are different types of function cards in the game which allow the players to do different things such as finding out what is hidden in the beehives or taking another player&rsquo;s tile. Players can use their memory and deception skills to make full use of the different functions and turn it into a mind game, in which the winner will have outdone the others by tricking their opponents and earning the most honey. At the end of game, players score points for each honey tile that they own. The honey bee and wasps cause no instant harm to the players during the game, however if the players still have them in their baskets when the game ends, they will be penalized.

Xilits have a highly organized society divided into two distinct classes: the worker and the warrior, which are physically and culturally distinct from one another. Xilits are able to work in perfect harmony due to their hive mind, which for the xilit makes meaningful contact with other races an unpleasant chore.<br/><br/>"}}
