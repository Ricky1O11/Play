This small farming village is but the first step to total victory.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The Hamlet is a large-scale map of a farming village. Scale is each one inch/square/hex is approximately 10 to 15 feet. This map can be used as the layout of a village for use in a fantasy game or it could be used as the site of a large-scale or mass combat battle. The Hamlet includes a 360-degree panoramic view of the Hamlet from a perspective as if standing in the northern part of the village.<br/><br/>The Hamlet is intended for use in fantasy, historical, and modern games (adding some farm machinery can make it feel more modern or it could be a farming community than shuns such technology like the Amish).<br/><br/>The major terrain feature of the hamlet is a river that varies from 10-30 feet (depending on the scale decided upon) in width spanned by five wooden bridges (two in the north, one in the center, and two in the south parts of the river). These wooden bridges are likely able to support wagons, horses, etc., but might strain under the weight of heavy vehicles such as tanks. Most of the hamlet is on the western bank with some houses and fields on the eastern bank north and south of the main village. In any type of conflict, controlling these bridges will be crucial to preventing the enemy from crossing the river and entering the main hamlet in the center of the map.<br/><br/>This terrain feature allows you to designate two zones for deployment, the defender&rsquo;s zone in the western bank and an attacker&rsquo;s zone in the eastern bank. The defenders need to stop the attackers from breaking through to the western edge of the map to win and the attackers need to overrun the hamlet and breakthrough to the other side to win.<br/><br/>Some example scenarios could be the Allies set up on the western side with German forces attacking them from across the Rur River during the Battle of the Bulge. Or the Germans are set up on the western side of the hamlet with the Russians crossing the Oder River as they approach Berlin. Heavily armored vehicles like tanks crossing will sink the bridges, but lighter vehicles like trucks, jeeps, and lightly armored scouts can make it across. Field engineers who can erect a metal bridge might also be of great importance to the attackers to establish a route to get heavy tanks and tank destroyers across the river.

It is a game of stellar exploration, planetary investigation, starship battles, diplomacy, crafting, commodity trading, and much, much more, all set in a totally procedurally generated infinite universe. In layman's terms this means that with each game an entirely new universe is created, allowing for unlimited replayability.<br/><br/>Gameplay is highly approachable, with Approaching Infinity taking on the tropes of what makes a &quot;classic&quot; rogue-like game while infusing the game with a modern, player focused commitment. Beautiful retro-visuals provided by David Gervais (known for his various rogue-like tilesets, along with other science-fiction titles), and immersive music by Nathan Becker aka 'ectogemia', transport players into Approaching Infinity's realm. Control can be mouse or keyboard. An intelligent interaction system allows players to focus on gameplay and not a multitude of commands.<br/><br/>Approaching Infinity's nods to classic rogue-like play includes permadeath, procedurally generated environments (with over thirty different generation algorithms), random creatures, items, and quests. Artifacts must be identified and there is a ticking oxygen clock for away missions. Yet, thanks to the ability to turn permadeath off, the ease of play, helpful tooltips, and more, this is a player's rogue-like game; a game of endless adventure, a game of 'one more turn'.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Approaching Infinity is about your story amongst the inky darkness of a bejeweled galaxy. Tell it the way you want it told. Be the gruff but lovable space pirate, the alpha leader who personally puts him or herself in danger, the wide eyed explorer who simply wants to absorb the beauty of creation. And when that story is over, start it all over and discover a brand new universe.<br/><br/>Approaching Infinity, the absolute joy of sci-fi adventure on your computer.<br/><br/>Turn based<br/>Perma death: optional.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "169066": {"poll": {}, "name": "The world of Stena: let the game begin", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2305450_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"10874": {"name": "We Are Sailing"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2305450.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"258877": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>This is the game about the Stena Sphere.

The twelve scenarios cover actions from 1939 to 1944 with each of the combatants in the Combat Commander Series represented in at least one scenario.  The Tournament Guidelines Booklet contains the preferred rules the designer uses to implement and run tournaments at the World Boardgaming Championships and the PrezCon Game Convention.  These guidelines are an out of the box solution for any potential tournament host but are also easily adapted to suit any style of tournament play.<br/><br/>The scenarios included in CC Tournament Battle Pack&ndash;Leader of Men are:<br/><br/>&ldquo;Hill 133&rdquo;, German vs Russian, 1943, Map 24; <br/>&ldquo;Blitzkreig Unleashed&rdquo;, German vs Polish, September 1939, Map 12; <br/>&ldquo;A Midnight Clear&rdquo;, German vs US, December 1944, Map 3;<br/>&ldquo;The Bridge Too Far&rdquo;, German vs British, September 1944, Map 17;<br/>&ldquo;On the Road to Victory&rdquo;, British vs Italian, July 1943, Map 10;<br/>&ldquo;One Steppe Beyond&rdquo;, German vs Russian, March 1943, Map 8; <br/>&ldquo;Signals in the Snow&rdquo;, Finnish vs Russian, November 1939, Map 20;<br/>&ldquo;Codes in the Sunrise&rdquo;, German vs British, June 1940, Map 4;<br/>&ldquo;Operation Mercury&rdquo;, German vs British, May 1941;<br/>&ldquo;Barbarossa Unleashed&rdquo;, German vs Russian, June 1941;<br/>&ldquo;Red Sector A&rdquo;, German vs US, 1944, New Map;<br/>&ldquo;La Villa Strangiato&rdquo;, US vs Italian, 1944.

Players organize their owned Resources, inventory, Party Characters, excess Characters and movement bonuses here. In addition, Town Play Mats can be upgraded three different ways: Town Defense Chips, Town Technologies and Action Cards. The first two upgrades are available for purchase during the Town Business Phase. However, Action Cards are dealt at the beginning of each Turn and are also drawn as a reward.<br/><br/>    Players also manage their Party consisting of five Character Cards. Characters may be equipped with gear (Spoils Cards), to increase their Base Skills. A party can move around the map, draw Encounter and Mission cards (stories) which contain Skill Checks (challenges) and even attack another player's Party in PVP. Dice are rolled for these many &quot;deeds&quot; to determine the outcome. <br/> There are seven decks of cards. These are drawn and played throughout the game. Some are stories, such as Encounter and Mission Cards, Characters are a Faction's agents, and Spoils are equipment/vehicle/gear. Lastly, Action Cards modify the story and/or game play.<br/><br/>To win, one of two Victory Conditions is necessary, either 20 Prestige or 80 Town Health. Prestige represents your reputation as a leader, while Town Health represents your town&rsquo;s prosperity and number of its citizens. Both conditions are marked on their respective Victory Tracks bordering the map.<br/><br/>Adventure and intrigue await!

The available actions are: Fleet (move ships), Research (develop tech), Council (Create votes on new rules), Planetary (develop your civilization), Energy (generate resources) and Logistics (build new ships). Players score points for colonizing worlds, developing tech, building colonies, passing votes and developing their civilization.

We decided to change that.  In Feats Reforged, feats scale in ability as you do, so that their level of ability matches your own.<br/><br/>Many of the so-called &ldquo;worthless&rdquo; feats have now been reforged, so that their abilities are on par with other feats, and each feat now scales in ability with their users.<br/><br/>You will find that most feats now also have an additional bonus effect at around 7th, 14th and sometimes even 20th level.  This represents your increase in skill with these feats and talents.<br/><br/>In addition, these feats are an excellent resource if you play in a low magic setting.  You can focus on allowing the players to be the heroes, relying on their own abilities, rather than focusing on the magic items they carry.<br/><br/>Every feat should remain viable, at every level.<br/><br/>Inside Feats Reforged, Volume III, you will find hundreds of reforged feats from the &quot;Big Hardback Combat Book&quot; by Paizo Publishing.  With these new variations of the classic feats you will find much more utility and benefit, even after leveling past their initial value.  Hammer these into your game and reforge your feats!<br/><br/>"}, "169161": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2313209.jpg", "poll": {}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "10", "boardgamepublisher": {"8716": {"name": "One Draw"}}, "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2313209_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "description": "The Merchant of Mystery is a single Promo card given out at Game Market 2014 in Japan.<br/><br/>His ability reads:<br/><br/>Play: Look at all cards in the Ruins, take one into your hand.<br/>Trash: if there are 4 or more cards in the ruins, this card's number becomes 15.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"259128": "Japanese first edition"}, "name": "Lost Legacy: Merchant of Mystery (promo)", "playingtime": "10", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "average": "7", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "1", "expands": {"142039": {"name": "Lost Legacy"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"25604": "Lost Legacy"}}, "169162": {"rpgitemversion": {"259129": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Aftermath", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2307040.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"550": "Modern"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"26278": "The Aftermath"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpgseries": {"26212": "Golden Cobra Challenge 2014"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2307040_t.png", "description": "From the PDF:<br/><br/>What This Game is About: This is a freeform game about injury, privilege, and the social effects on those with injures.

Even worse, some of us disagree as to what those elements are.<br/><br/>By reading this timeline, you have become part of that unique group of people who have shared in the Traveller experience. It is my hope that this document helps you remain and participate, and contribute to it.<br/><br/>By the way, my most enjoyable fan moment with Traveller: shortly after I did the very first version of this, I discovered a large package in my box. Much to my shock and amazement, it was addressed from Marc W. Miller, and contained notes on things I was missing. I&rsquo;ve played many games, but Traveller still excites the fan boy in me.

It should come as no surprise, then, that wizards, witches, and other powerful spellcasters are always on the lookout for new and exciting spells to add to their repertoires. While many spells from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook received a facelift and an upgrade in Mythic Adventures, the sourcebook that introduced mythic power to the game of Pathfinder, dozens of spells were left behind. Missing Mythic Magic Volume XII, and its predecessors, aim to give each and every spell from the core rules a full-fledged mythic upgrade, all the way from A to Z, with a special focus on making mythic spells that feel as over-the-top and larger-than-life as possible.<br/><br/>This installment includes 23 mythic spells, from incendiary cloud to locate object. A mythic insect plague not only summons more swarms, but also allows the caster to summon swarms of far more powerful creatures, including hellwasp swarms. A mythic invisibility purge punishes creatures that it strips invisibility from, inflicting severe damage on them, while a mythic know direction not only functions in places without a true North, but can also provide the direction of major geographical features.

The players must go through the dungeon and fulfill whatever conditions the DJ puts forth in order to win.<br/><br/>Xcrawl is a sport and the challenges are created, but the danger is no less real. If you die, you die. There are no second chances. Citizens of the North American Empire tune in every week to watch their favorite celebrities get eaten, paralyzed, turned to stone, and ripped apart.

The identity cards will have a name and 2 roles on it. The roles allow you to do take actions (See role cards for list of actions). You may also bluff to take the other actions, but if another player calls your bluff, you are exposed and you lose (see bluffing on next card).<br/><br/>Bluffing: When you use a role, someone may call you a liar. If they do, reveal your card to them. If the used role is one of the two on your card, they lose and reveal their card. If you bluffed and got caught, you lose and reveal your card. You cannot lie about whether an assassin or accuser correctly guessed your identity.<br/><br/>There are 3 green and 3 blue roles. Each identity has 1 green and 1 blue. There are no repeats of combinations. When cards are discarded, discard them facedown. When the draw pile runs out, do not reshuffle the discard pile. When the draw pile is empty, powers that require drawing a card cannot be used.<br/><br/>Each turn you may take any action on the roles card. Everyone has access to black actions (they are always safe). If players use a green or blue action, their opponents may call their bluff. When an opponent is the target of a spy or assassinate, they may use the sentinel or facade actions to counter them. These 2 blue actions do not require an action to use (though they can still be bluffs).<br/><br/>When you think an opponent has sentinel, be sure to accuse them  because they will block an assassination attempts.<br/><br/>Roles:<br/>Accuse (Black) - Guess a player&rsquo;s identity. If you are right they die, otherwise you die.<br/>Invent (Black) - Discard your identity and draw a new one.<br/>Assassinate (Green) - Guess a player&rsquo;s identity, if you are right they die.<br/>Spy (Green) - Look at another player&rsquo;s identity.<br/>Disguise (Green) - Draw a new Identity then discard one.<br/>Sentinel (Blue) - Prevent Assassination.<br/>Facade (Blue) - Prevent Spy.<br/>Scour (Blue) - Look through discard pile or draw pile (shuffle draw pile after).<br/><br/>In the Mace Exclusive version of Exploit!, all the green keywords are red!<br/><br/>"}, "169243": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2310255.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"73547": {"name": "Thiago Aranha"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"44789": "Andrea Cofrancesco"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"21608": {"name": "CMON Limited"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2310255_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "description": "A strange prince, from a distant land.

In every game, you select devious plots and challenge your opponents on the field of battle, through back alley intrigue, and in the political arena. Whether you play a against a single opponent, in a game known as a joust, or engage in a battle of three or more players, called a melee, winning challenges against your opponents is the way to victory.<br/><br/>Your ultimate goal in A Game of Thrones: The Card Game is to gain influence over the greatest seat of power in Westeros: the Iron Throne! To achieve this goal, you must call upon iconic characters, such as Tywin Lannister, Robb Stark, Stannis Baratheon, Daenerys Targaryen, Euron Crow's Eye, The Red Viper, and dozens of others. You must maneuver the members of your House and your allies in a constant battle to gain power. The first player to claim fifteen power wins!<br/><br/>In the game, each player has two decks: a draw deck and a plot deck. Your draw deck contains the tactical elements of your struggle, including the characters, locations, attachments, and events that you call upon in your struggle to claim the Iron Throne. You can command characters from throughout A Song of Ice and Fire, and you can march forth from the icy walls of Winterfell or muster your armies around Casterly Rock. You may even equip your characters with storied weapons, such as the Valyrian steel blades Ice or Widow's Wail. The draw deck holds these powerful characters, locations, attachments, and events. This deck is randomly shuffled and players draw their hands from this deck.<br/><br/>At the start of each round, each player simultaneously chooses and reveals one of the plot cards from their individual seven-card plot decks. Your plot for a round determines how much gold you can spend on cards, which player starts with initiative, and how powerful your challenges are. Your plot also bears a reserve value, which determines how many cards you can keep in your hand past the end of the round. Plots may also offer powerful effects that can trigger when the plots are revealed or persist to shape the entire game round. You may scorch the earth with a deadly wildfire assault, or call upon all players to support the faith of the Seven.<br/><br/>A Game of Thrones: The Card Game (Second Edition) differs from the first edition of the game due to elements being cut, elements being revised or updated, and elements being added. Influence was a holdover from the game's origin as a CCG and is now unnecessary, while crests offered nothing to distinguish them from traits and made the game more difficult for new players to learn. Existing keywords have been pruned, and some new keywords have been added to showcase the most interesting and essential interactions.<br/><br/>The timing rules &mdash; such as the details of moribund, passive effects with triggers, and save/cancel responses &mdash; will be replaced with a more straightforward timing system that takes advantage of the Interrupt, Reaction, and Forced triggers that have been successfully employed in some of FFG's newer LCGs.<br/><br/>The second edition also includes two new factions beyond the six Houses in the first edition. New deck-building rules empower players with more options in combining factions, alongside a means of building more focused and specialized plot decks.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"295096": "Czech first edition"}, "average": "7.87927", "name": "A Game of Thrones: The Card Game (Second Edition)", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "2424", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4667": "Customizable Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"6040": "CCGs (Collectible Card Games)"}}, "169256": {"poll": {}, "name": "Hoverkraft", "playingtime": "5", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "34", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2310434_t.jpg", "average": "5.58088", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"18920": {"name": "thinkgeek.com"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2310434.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"259489": "English First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "5", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "5", "description": "Hoverkraft is an old-school building game with a twist.

And it's a fast game, lasting anywhere from 30 seconds (what? we were distracted) to 5 minutes. Bring it to a party and you can have an entire tournament in a few hours. Your friends may curse you for introducing them to Hoverkraft at first, but they'll be drawn back to it.

The game was released on the Steam platform for the PC on March 24, 2014. Set in colonial Virginia in the 17th century, the game includes stealth elements, with players stalking their enemies and using colonial weaponry to defeat them.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Betrayer is a stealth horror action-adventure played from a first-person perspective. It uses a monochrome art style that Eurogamer\u200a'\u200bs Dan Whitehead described as &quot;undeniably striking&quot;.[2] The game has no clear missions or markers for quest objectives, aiming to initially perplex players by not providing a defined sense of direction. Sound plays a central role in exploring the game world, as it is used to lead the player to clues and other points of interest. While progressing, any clues found are meticulously documented in the inventory windows. Similar to The Elder Scrolls series, players can quickly navigate from one location to another by clicking a point-of-interest icon on the game's map.<br/><br/>In the game, players stealthily kill enemy conquistadors by creeping through tall grass and hiding their movements by timing them with strong gusts of wind. Enemies are killed using a variety of antiquated weaponry including bows, crossbows, pistols, muskets, and thrown tomahawks. Taking inspiration from Dark Souls, when the player dies in the game all of their items are left on their corpse at the location of death. The player then respawns at the base fort and must journey back to where they died to retrieve their items from their corpse. If the player dies again before retrieving their items, then the items on that first corpse will disappear and can not be recovered.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Betrayer (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "169289": {"rpg": {"13236": "AD&D First Edition (1e) Compatible Products"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Dungeon Module UR1: The Tomb of the Sea Kings", "rpgproducer": {"79185": "Nathan Jennings"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2311023.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "rpgitemversion": {"259564": "First Printing (Lulu)"}, "average": "8.5", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2311023_t.jpg", "description": "From the back cover:<br/>After a successful plunder of the Urchinn Isles, a well deserved night of drinking is in order, during such you trade stories with a local &quot;antique dealer&quot; who tells of a well-financed acquaintance who is organizing an archeological dig.

Each continent offers dark unexplored recesses and mythic quests drawing the attention of quixotic treasure hunters. Yes, here adventure is still alive; peril is one footfall away. This is the world of Century&rsquo;s Edge.<br/><br/>The year is 18??. A traumatic result of &ldquo;Dr. Well&rsquo;s&rdquo; experiments with time (see, The Time Machine) has created a splintered universe -a world, where man has never quite fully come out of the Industrial Revolution. Pockets of strange temporal energy have preserved areas of the earth in one time period or another -varying by several decades in some instances. Traveling across these invisible and largely unmarked zones sometimes results in interesting phenomena.<br/><br/>Traversing these &ldquo;quantum bubbles&rdquo; sometimes results in aging, or rejuvenation. Equipment from &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; bubbles may become dysfunctional in primitive zones. The cure to this madness seems eons beyond the science of the realm, and civilization has begun to adapt to these peculiarities.

But whenever you see a bird, word will get out. Anticipate the crowd to see more birds than anyone else!<br/><br/>Birds of a Feather is a fast, friendly, easy to learn card game for 2-7 players. The game is easy enough for children to learn and enjoy, but surprisingly strategic, making it a great filler for more hard core gamers.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt a large hand of cards. The game takes place over several rounds. In each round, each player chooses a card to play simultaneously. This determines not only which bird that player sees that round, but which habitat that player visits. Players check off the birds they see on a score sheet, seeing their own bird plus any other birds in the same habitat.

The very nature of the game means that spells, and spellcasting, work a certain way. While there are plenty of spells to choose from, eventually you reach a point where just casting the same old things over and over again gets boring. And that&rsquo;s where the books in the Advanced Arcana series come in.<br/><br/>Advanced Arcana Volume V is more than just a collection of 120 brand new, never-before-seen spells. It, like its critically-acclaimed predecessors, was specifically designed to challenge the status quo of the way that magic works in your game. Previous installments of Advanced Arcana have created spells with different effects when cast at different spell levels, spells that modify other spells, and spells which blurred the lines between the schools of magic. This installment turns its eyes to the idea of spells with a mind of their own, in an attempt to create magic that feels more mysterious, out of control, and, ultimately, magical. In this book you will find spells whose effect depends on the roll of a die, spells that are more or less effective depending on the whims of your magical patron, spells that can be cast only when a predetermined trigger occurs, and spells that may backfire upon the caster if they are not handled with care, among many other fun and exciting new spells.<br/><br/>But even above and beyond Advanced Arcana Volume V's numerous groundbreaking new spells that will have you rethinking what you thought you knew about magic, the book contains a number of expansive appendices on such topics as&hellip;<br/><br/>    &hellip;a selection of feats that allow casters to make the most of the new spell mechanics.<br/>    &hellip;traits for familiars, giving them more personality as well as mechanical customization.<br/>    &hellip;a mini-bestiary of new sentient spells, containing 17 creatures from CR 4 to 20.<br/>    &hellip;and more!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>If you&rsquo;ve already experienced one of the previous installments of Advanced Arcana, you know that this book is not to be missed.

The very word evokes mental pictures of brave knights rescuing fair maidens from high towers, dark dungeons, or dastardly dragons. But all those stories seems to focus on ladies in the role, seemingly too weak to handle their own affairs. The modern women I know would never need rescue. They would give those witches, evildoers, and dragons a piece of their mind and likely more if the situation called for it. Waiting for rescue? Not in their repertoire.<br/><br/>But it's one of those repeated story lines in many adventures. Rescuing a lost child, a missing animal, a group of wayward adults... the list goes on.<br/><br/>Sometimes we need one of those folks in distress and don't quite know how they got there or what situation to relate. That's where Insta-NPCs comes in.<br/><br/>Why not take out a handful of dice and roll up an instant NPC damsel in distress! Or in this case, an &quot;Insta-NPC&quot;! The Insta-NPCs product line is designed to offer one or more tables to roll on to figure out a little something about the NPC you're pulling together.<br/><br/>For Insta-NPCs #7: Damsels in Distress, we offer eleven tables and a guided process through which you can find your damsels - whether it's a single person or a group. It may even offer some supernatural elements to explore. One example includes a ghost and another includes something nasty that really shouldn't have been discovered at the bottom of a hole but followed a victim back to the world...<br/><br/>Let's go through an example... Perhaps I need a short adventure around a rescue but am not quite sure how to frame it. I pull out a few dice and get these terms to build around:<br/><br/>Individual or Group? Individual<br/>Type? Supernatural<br/>Gender? Male<br/>Who created the trouble? Outsider<br/>What is the trouble? Supernatural<br/>Location? Mine<br/>Condition? Dead<br/>Trope? Besieged<br/><br/>Whoa. This ought to be intriguing. Unusual to hit a supernatural combination in the random lottery. I might play it into:<br/><br/>&quot;The Mines of Moro have been abandoned for years on the outskirts of the Kingdom. The dwarves long ago discovered something deep and fled, warning others away from the area. They said they had contained it, but that was years ago. Nobody had thought of it since.<br/><br/>That was before the echoes began. At first, it was just those few settlements closest to the mines who reported the strange howling. As those spread to the capitol, the authorities began to take notice. It was affecting the sleep of the royal family. <br/><br/>A member of the Kingsguard led a small unit into the mines three weeks ago and the echoes stopped, though they never returned. Last night, the echoes began again.<br/><br/>When the royal wizard spoke with the shade of the Kingsguard, he realized what danger the kingdom truly faced. The dwarves had scratched the barrier to the Fell Hall, a space within the world thought to house the lesser demons serving Hel. These creatures would do anything to escape but are wasted beyond the ability to communicate clearly. Instead, the demon wail drives mortals mad. Whatever barrier the dwarves had put into place had worn away and was needing to be replaced.<br/><br/>The wizard has summoned your party and given you detailed instructions on how to replace the barrier. Godspeed heroes.&quot;<br/><br/>That's not as much an NPC as it is an entire plot waiting to be explored. And all from a collection of 8 words. Who knows where it will lead from here?<br/><br/>Insta-NPCs #7: Damsels in Distress offers eight main tables and three alternate location tables for fantasy, modern, horror, and science-fiction genre stories. Use these seeds to inspire your imaginations and throw something new and unusual at your players the next time you meet!<br/><br/>Like all Moebius Adventures supplements, Damsels in Distress is designed to be system- and genre-neutral. This 8 page PDF includes nine tables with examples, three worksheets, some examples, and four unique NPCs (with portraits) you can use right away.<br/><br/>"}, "169363": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Reign of Ruin (Pathfinder)", "rpgproducer": {"64515": "Kevin Morris"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2318704.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"259686": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"26502": "Deadly Delves"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2318704_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Beware The Blackener Of Bright Waters, For She Is Come Again<br/><br/>Rumors of death move like a plague through the Crannogtowns of the Great Swamp&mdash;of ranger patrols mysteriously disappearing on routine scouting missions, of a winged shadow that blots out the midday sun, and of entire villages slaughtered, their homes left burning and the victims&rsquo; flesh melted from their bones.

It is an excellent resource for the official Pathfinder RPG Pirate Adventure Path or for any campaign that spends a significant time at sea.<br/><br/>"}, "169402": {"rpg": {"9041": "Mutants & Masterminds (3rd Edition)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Hardrock", "rpgproducer": {"56281": "Charlie McElvy"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2318701.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"259767": "PDF version"}, "rpgsetting": {"18256": "WatchGuard"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"171": "Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"9588": "Super-Powered by M&M"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2318701_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>H\u0100DOROKKU!<br/><br/>Percussionist-turned-heroic &quot;big brother&quot;, Date &quot;Jimmy&quot; Masamune may have rock hard skin, and a tough demeanor, but he's as soft as they come on the inside -- where it counts.

An adept onmy\u014dji is in touch with the natural world, as well as the spirits that tend to it. Historically, onmy\u014dji were retained by rulers and other decision makers to help ensure that all festivals and other holidays fell on lucky days, as well as in an advisory role regarding policy. Some onmy\u014dji differentiated further, becoming ritualistic healers, as well.<br/><br/>The kami are the onmy\u014dji's lifelong allies. Some, he venerates as gods, while he may bind other, lesser spirits to his direct service as shikigami. The spirits of the land can be petitioned directly, or their powers channeled through mystical talismans: o-fuda and omamori. Without these spirits, the onmy\u014dji is nothing in a fight, but without the onmy\u014dji, the spirits have no mortal herald to call their own.<br/><br/>In game terms, an onmy\u014dji is a powerful support spellcaster with an equally powerful shikigami spirit at his side. Completely devoid of classic Vancian magic systems, an onmy\u014dji is instead possessed of powerful area denial magic through the use of talismans, which channels power that is impossible to resist, thus necessitating the destruction of the talisman to get around his magic.<br/><br/>Product Features:<br/><br/>    The onmy\u014dji base class, a pet-focused full caster with two new systems of magic: petitions and talismans, and no traditional Vancian magic<br/>    Rules for an onmy\u014dji's shikigami, a powerful bound spirit that has its own spellcasting resources<br/>    29 talismans, with separate effects for area-of-effect o-fuda or single-target omamori<br/>    28 petitions, which call upon great beings, even Buddhist and Shinto gods, for aid<br/>    7 Friendship feats, representing a personal relationship with one of the Seven Lucky Gods.

In order to successfully launch products, you must develop the necessary infrastructure while keeping an eye on external events, which might help or hinder your efforts.<br/><br/>Launch &amp; Iterate is a turn based cooperative card game. Tech cards are the primary type of card used in the game. Tech cards enable development of either core infrastructure (e.g. Data Redundancy), or offer one-shot benefits (e.g. Refactor). Tech cards are also used as the primary currency in the game, representing engineering effort required to develop new technology or to contribute to launching new products.<br/><br/>During the game, players focus on launching 1 or (potentially) more products at any given time. Successfully launching products increases the overall user base (in millions of users) and allows players to shift effort onto new products. Players attempt to maximize the total user base by the end of the game by strategically selecting the right products to work on at the right time. Each product has specific infrastructure requirements which must be met, along with a cost (in Tech cards) which must be contributed by players in order to successfully launch the product.<br/><br/>On their turn, players may select a Tech card to play from their hand (making sure that all requirements and costs are met), contribute any number of Tech cards from their hand to help launch an active product, and draw new card(s). At the end of each round, players reveal the next Event card, which can either deliver a benefit or incur a penalty, depending on the card as well as the infrastructure levels players have developed. The game is over after 11 events have been resolved.<br/><br/>A key factor in Launch &amp; Iterate is developing infrastructure across 4 critical technology stacks, (F)eatures, (A)ccessibility, (S)torage, and (T)esting. Each stack is built up over the course of the game, from base level 0 to level 7. Developing infrastructure is critical to successfully launching products, but usually doesn't directly affect the user base. Each stack also offers specific benefits at higher levels, such as reducing or negating negative Event effects, increasing user base, enabling better allocation of resources or increasing development capabilities.<br/><br/>"}, "169425": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2481872.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"79252": {"name": "Chase Layman"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"79250": "Michael Anderson (II)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"28638": {"name": "World of Rivals LLC"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2481872_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "description": "IN THE DEEPEST OF THE DEEP SEAS...<br/><br/>lies the Lurk.

At the opposite extreme, the titanic giant purple worm embodies brutal strength and primal power, while the equally huge neothelid is a lurking alien menace of the deep places beneath the world, its wormy exterior belying an advanced alien intelligence. The sinister seugathi are spawned by the neothelids as their spies and slaves, but are formidable in their own right, and like them the vermlek demon is an infiltrator par excellence, wriggling inside the remains of its victims and wearing their mind and body as a fleshy suit until the moment they burst forth in a rain of terror and blood. The freezing frost worm is legendarily as deadly in death as in life, while the sizzling thoqqua bores through stone and steel as easily as flesh. Not truly worms, perhaps, the heaving bulk of the giant slug and the kaleidoscopic shell of the freakish flail snail are nonetheless a sight dreaded by adventurers of every stripe. Perhaps most deadly of all, the worm that walks embodies every part of wormish terror in the form of slain sorcerer risen again through the eldritch appetite of the worms that consumed his living flesh. To this collection of worms CR 3 to 21, we present the terrifying ghoul-spewing conqueror worm, a carrion crawler supreme that devours and regurtigates the dead as its feasting slaves.

Players take on the roles of Defenders of the last known haven for humanity, called The Last Stand. Four outside clans leaders, along with their followers, advance toward the town, and players work cooperatively to defend The Last Stand.  Menacing mutants also roam the desert threatening the city's survival. The game will introduce player character mutations - your character can mutate from travel into irradiated areas. Gameplay will consist of both elements of adventure and conflict resolution, and Defenders of the Last Stand will come loaded with miniatures, including three large sculpted miniatures of the invading Clan leaders as well as their minions - sculpted by Chad Hoverter. The four warrior clans include raiders on bikes and in cars, another group of human amazons that ride large mutated beasts, a third clan consisting of techno savvy, yet criminally insane youths, and finally a large winged creature so mutated that he has lost all traces of his old humanity.<br/><br/>&quot;Today we discovered a fallen caravan not fifteen miles up dry road. I had been that way to visit Auntie's just recently and there weren't no caravans, fallen or otherwise, there before. This means the Raiders have been circling the last stand for at least the last two weeks. Pepzi asked me to stay a while in case they attack. No more scavenging for now, she said. &quot;Something is brewing. The air hurts my lungs. I see shadows in the hillside.&quot; The air is more dry than usual. My lips have all but cracked off. Doc gives me salve to put on them, but I tell him to keep it for the kids. New families are appearing in Stanfield. It's a good sight to see. We are finally surviving a bit, and bringing kids into this world again. I'm thinking of how in the good book we are told to be multiply. It's God's will, but most would say this land has been forsaken by God, but I'm hoping we can start again. Me, I'm hoping for the best, but my bones tell me there is no best.<br/><br/>&quot;The Last Stand was known as Stanfield back in the old world, before the great war. While battles raged in the cities across America and the world, as far as we know, some old-schoolers, cowboys, fighters, and drifters came together in this desert to escape the end of the world. The desert was only the safe place and Detroit says it's where a man learns to be a man. Detroit told me that Stanfield changed its name to The Last Stand back then. Cause it was the last fighting chance for humanity. Detroit knows lots of stories. He is old and claims he was alive in those days, 80 something years ago, back when they played something called baseball and Nitena. I don't know what to believe from his mouth, but he is a hoot to listen to. Course, he has been around a long time, changed by the Radiation &ndash; mutated like many folks, but still as human as human can be,  unlike the raiders. Detroit is one of us now. He knows stuff and and we are going to fight tooth and nail against the raiders wanting to take what we worked so hard to build. Rumor is that they have merged, and I reckon they will have to to capture this city. We are bonded together. Even got a little ancient technology and oil. Bad stuff maybe since it is what brought us here. We'll use it carefully.  The Last Stand may be our last hope.

At the start of the night Phase, each player rolls their Terror dice to determine how scary they are for that night. Players can move one room per turn, leaving behind a Terror die as they move. If the total of all dice in a room exceeds the courage of the human in residence of that room, they're scared out of the hotel!

The process of merely planning and gaining support to make such a risk-filled journey was a difficult path of its own. Yet, in securing the sponsorship of beloved Queen Isabel of Portugal, Raimundo was able to get the supplies and crew needed to accomplish his dream.<br/><br/>Players recreate this accomplishment in a game that plays out as a 3-stage story. First, gather evidence of the hidden land and assemble a plan in order to gain sponsorship from King Dinis, Queen Isabel, the Bishop of Lisbon, or 3 other important figures. Second, use the resources from your sponsor and the help of others to get the supplies and crew needed to make the journey. Finally, sail the treacherous seas to discover the &quot;Land of Danger.&quot;<br/><br/>Gameplay is centered around a deck of multi-use cards that will provide different forms of influence and characters that can provide help. Some cards are drawn secretly, while others are drafted publicly. Players discard cards from their hand to spend influence, which gains the help from the characters on other cards. The help may involve providing evidence of the land, plans on how to get there, gaining supplies or crew, etc.<br/><br/>The goal of the first act of the game is to secure the sponsorship of one of six major figures, who each have their own special powers that will provide help in the second and third acts of the game. While the game, ultimately, is a race to be first to get to the Land of Danger, points are also scored for helping others and having the most adventurous trip.<br/><br/>The game is playable solo, and also with 2 to 6 players. Player interaction can be very subtle and primarily consists of impacting the cards available for others to draw or draft, and vying for sponsorship and limited supplies and crew.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"259972": "First edition"}, "age": "12", "name": "Tales of Danger #1: Days of Discovery", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "average": "6", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "169494": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Cthulhus Ruf (Issue 6 - Nov 2014)", "rpgproducer": {"37248": "Y\u00f6rn Buttelmann"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2319139.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"18218": "Cthulhus Ruf"}, "rpg": {"310": "Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"259974": "regular issue 6"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2319139_t.jpg", "description": "(user summary)<br/>issue 6 features war as a theme<br/><br/>table of contents:<br/>preamble<br/>special column &quot;Die Fl&uuml;stert&uuml;te&quot;<br/>&quot;How to do the Gatsby&quot; - archives of a gamemaster<br/>Krieg &amp; Spiel - veterans as PCs<br/>Dunkler Sommer - a scenario for the great war era and the 1920s<br/>Time to go - a scenario for Cthulhu Now<br/>Kampf ums Empire - military service overseas<br/>Die Kolonialausstellung - a site for Gaslight and the 1920s<br/>Ultima Ratio - a scenario set in 1937<br/>Der Fleischer - a tale of terror set after the great war<br/>Geteiltes Leid - a site for the great war era<br/>Bonus - NSC: The Manhunter<br/>NSC if this issue: the drone pilot<br/><br/>"}, "169495": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Cthulhus Ruf Archiv (Issue 6 - Nov 2014): Das Geisterhausprojekt", "rpgproducer": {"37248": "Y\u00f6rn Buttelmann"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2319144.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"18218": "Cthulhus Ruf"}, "rpg": {"310": "Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"259975": "Cthulhus Ruf Archiv issue 6"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2319144_t.jpg", "description": "(user summary)<br/>This is a mockumentary called &quot;Das Geisterhausprojekt&quot; (The ghost house project)<br/><br/>"}, "169496": {"poll": {}, "name": "Achtung Kreuzung: Das neue Verkehrsspiel", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2078": "Point to Point Movement"}, "yearpublished": "1948", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"25247": "Traffic Games"}, "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2316175_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"28645": {"name": "Curt Cowall"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2316175.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"259980": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1031": {"name": "Racing"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The players have to move from &quot;Start&quot; to &quot;Ziel&quot;.

You don't have to learn a complicated system, refer to scores of tables, or spend all day creating characters. You can either create custom characters for the game or dive right in with any of the included templates. The game is designed to be light; it has a small footprint and extremely low price tag - it's not overloaded with tons of rules or an excess of information you just won't need. It's meant to get you running quickly so you can have a good time.<br/><br/>The setting is very open. Two centuries after forming the United Sovereign Worlds with the ape-like Digronians, Humanity spearheads peace and freedom in known space. While aliens are commonplace, some are more trusted than others. The bioframe-ridden Migado, insectoid Kt'Sorii, and synthetic X-ans are mankind's newest allies. And while the genetically-flawed Tarkosians are now also allies, many citizens cannot forget or forgive their involvement in the war that prompted the initial need for such alliances. Travel to mysterious destinations, discover new alien species, uncover diabolical plots, and battle space pirates with HardNova 2. The included scenarios immerse you into the setting so even if you don't want to the run them, you've still got a lot of info to work with to flavor your setting or inspire ideas. And if you don't want to use the setting, the rules are flexible enough to handle your own ideas or that of your favorite movie, television program, comic, or novel.<br/><br/>This expanded game compiles the HardNova 2 core book, both Enhancement Packs, Miniseries Alpha: The Vanguard, and Aliens: The Ruthdii in one book, plus includes even more content.<br/><br/>"}, "169498": {"boardgamedesigner": {"79246": {"name": "Albert Ma"}}, "average": "4.5", "poll": {}, "name": "Hunny Hunters", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}, "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2316414_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"79245": "Jamaika Wong"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"28631": {"name": "ShroomLab Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2316414.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"259984": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "In this game, players take on the role of grizzly bears who are trying to collect their beloved honey.

Players can use their memory and deception skills to make full use of the different functions and turn it into a mind game, in which the winner will have outdone the others by tricking their opponents and earning the most honey. At the end of game, players score points for each honey tile that they own. The honey bee and wasps cause no instant harm to the players during the game, however if the players still have them in their baskets when the game ends, they will be penalized.
