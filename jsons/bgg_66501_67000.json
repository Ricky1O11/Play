Players compete for victory points, which come mainly from contracts (sets of resources) and special cards (like a collected set of 1-4 identical &quot;counting offices&quot;, the port rewarding collected ship cards etc.). The game is build on two core concepts:<br/><br/>1. Players bid for cards by building &quot;towers&quot; with their meeples over them. Each meeple in a tower increases the cost of a card - but only for players &quot;below&quot; it. This is the main mechanic of the game - players must consider WHEN to bid (place their meeple) over a certain card and when to use their meeples to make others pay more. This is important, because a player can make only three bids during a round.<br/><br/>2. Players are punished by negative points for not collecting firemen cards. Thus, ignoring security may cost a player a victory. By many players, the &quot;punishing&quot; mechanic is considered a trademark of the author - Stefan Feld.<br/><br/>The deck is divided into four seasons - winter, spring, summer and autumn. In later seasons, more powerful cards appear, so players need to think ahead in managing their resources.<br/><br/>---- Promotional blurb from the publisher ----<br/><br/>Hamburg around 1900 - the gate to the world.

It is a full box game.<br/><br/>The Battle Manuver syster game uses cards, one deck for each player (whose cards are somewhat different from those of the other player) to drive the game. Each player gets a certain number of cards each turn - often a different number for each player! - but never his full deck. The cards are used to determine movement, combat, and actions such as Counter-Attack, and Rally, among others. Players may play as many of their cards up to 5 when it&rsquo;s their turn, using each card for only one of the possible three purposes. Play passes back and forth between players, until both players have used all their cards&hellip; and the turn is over.<br/><br/>Turning Point is thus a game of card play and management, which unfolds on the historical battle map - it uses squares, rather than hexes &ndash; with the use of some large counters. This is a game of position, feint, and sudden attack with what you hope are better odds (since you don&rsquo;t know what cards your opponent will play, if any, and you never know what his final strength will be).

Since that time, the world has been under a constant rainfall. Civilization as we know it has crumbled, slowly at first, but more rapidly as the rain destroyed those aspects of our world that we had thought most secure: our agriculture and our trade. The water level has risen, the temperature has risen, and all too rapidly to react to. And no one claims any more that this was all our fault, because we know whose fault it was. There are no ice caps, but we didn&rsquo;t melt them. The world is a jungle of sorts, but we didn&rsquo;t let that grow. The world is now slowly taking the shape that they prefer, and a day will come when they are ready to take possession.<br/><br/>And some of the people of this sodden world intend to be ready for that day.<br/><br/>Deluge is system-free but there will be places throughout that imply systemic choices. I&rsquo;ll highlight these because if you intend to fit Deluge into your preferred system, these are the places where the work might be. Sometimes that work will be identifying analogous mechanism &mdash; your system does the same thing but uses a different term. Sometimes that work will require new mechanism and where this seems likely, I&rsquo;ll try to point towards a fruitful path.

Five clans of goblins are represented on the game cards, with goblins in one of three ranks. To build an army, a player must first recruit level I goblins, then build on those goblins with level II and finally level III. Those higher level goblins can be played only if a lower level goblin is of the same clan, and since goblins of the same clan have similar abilities or powers that mesh well, players tend to specialize in who they recruit to their ranks.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player can play a new goblin, activate a goblin, draw cards, or pass. To activate a goblin or draw cards, players need to spend 1-2 activation tokens, with them having only two at the start of each battle. Many goblins have special powers that come into play when they're recruited, attacked, removed from play, placed with other goblins, and so on.<br/><br/>Once all players have passed, the player with the most powerful army wins the battle. Players keep cards in hand from one battle to the next, so laying out all your forces at once can leave you with little to do but get hit in later battles.

It is as close to a home as anyone has ever found for the perytons, and its paths through the Storm connect worlds that were never meant to meet.<br/><br/>Qalidar was designed specifically for the True20 system and, in addition to the setting, includes new creatures, new treasures, and new rules that could enhance any OGL-based campaign, including a surprisingly fun system for alchemy and rules for traversing the Storm.<br/><br/>"}, "66601": {"rpgartist": ["Guy Burwell", "Darrell Midgette", "Dan Smith"], "rpg": ["GURPS (4th Edition)"], "poll": [], "name": "Clerics", "rpgdesigner": ["Phil Masters"], "rpgproducer": ["Sean Punch", "Nikola Vrtis"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic661550.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "7", "rpgissuearticle": ["The Tricks of the Shaman"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Steve Jackson Games"], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["GURPS Dungeon Fantasy"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic661550_t.jpg", "description": "From the publishers website:<br/><br/>When trapped in the dankest corners of a forsaken dungeon, there may be little left to do but pray . . . but for a special class of hero, prayer is enough.

Six new starter decks Animals, Crops, Elementals, Energy, Land and Technology will be available, and players can construct personalized decks of no less than 60 cards, with the cards from any deck.<br/><br/>When the insatiable appetite of Killer Bunnies game fans demanded more, Playroom looked to Killer Bunnies creator and game designer Jeffrey Neil Bellinger to coordinate the development of, like other games in the Killer Bunnies family, a non-collectible game that can offer variations through different color nick-named deck options. However, this time a new desire expressed by the huge Killer Bunnies fan-base has been fulfilled: Killer Bunnies now has a constructable game variation. Though still not collectible or random, players can now buy starter decks and booster expansions for Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey and then use any combination of those cards to form their own constructed decks to play against opponents. Unlike in Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot, where up to eight players play with the same deck of cards, all sharing the same draw pile, Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey has players each draw only from their own constructed deck of 60 cards. There are not any random packs, so players will always know which cards they are purchasing in a deck and they can buy the right products for their planned deck. For Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey  six brand new starter decks (red, violet, blue, yellow, green, or orange) allow players to construct a personalized deck with any of the cards of any deck.<br/><br/>The setting for the new game is an ultimate race to build a bunny society on planet Earth. Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey pits players against each other as they struggle to gain Civilization Points, by building cities and increasing their bunny populations. Players gain points by developing their own civilizations or by using zany weapons and hilarious scenarios to destroy their opponents.<br/><br/>Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey is the latest in the family of Killer Bunnies games which features, Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot, Killer Bunnies REMIX, Kinder Bunnies: Their First Adventure and Killer Bunnies and the Journey to Jupiter.<br/><br/><br/>In addition to individual starter decks (A-decks) and expansion decks (B-, C-, D- and E-decks), the following products are offered.

Others use rituals to obtain collections of the liquid known as moonwater, and so say that the the entirety of the moon must be made of the same magical liquid, floating eerily as a giant celestial raindrop. Some priests or witches see the moonlight as a blessing from an ancient goddess or other entity, and claim that she herself makes up the shape of the moon, or else that it is her domain, having long abandoned the sea of the gods in order to viscerally convey to mortals the majesty of the moon goddess. The last major speculation may well coincide with some versions of the goddess theory, and it supposes that the moon is a great, floating boulder that glows with the light of either some quantified or otherwise mysterious force. This theory is supported by the existence of the Moon Tablet: a great piece of rock upon which is written many secrets of the moon and its magics.<br/>The Lunar Scrolls contains 31 pages of content, including four paragon classes (a multiclass-only class combined with a paragon path), four short character stories, an epic destiny, a page of feats, two pages of magic items, six pages of rituals, and five pages of monsters.<br/><br/>"}, "66631": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic732950.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Laurent Pouchain"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Hub", "Fran\u00e7ois Lecocq", "Geoffrey Stepourenko"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Asmodee", "Hazgaard Editions"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic732950_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Comic Book / Strip", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fighting", "Medieval", "Miniatures"], "description": "Third expansion to Okko, Era of the Asagiri that adds the Pajan Army and ambassador as mercenaries and includes:<br/><br/>10 new characters and their profile cards<br/>Ambassadors Attaku, Pajan, Bashimon and Yommo<br/>Two Ashigaru<br/>Captain Fukashi<br/>An Expert Arquebusier <br/>A Veteran Soldier<br/>A Witch-soldier<br/><br/>4 equipment cards (Elemental Standards)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "age": "12", "name": "Okko, Pajan Gun'Ta\u00ef", "playingtime": "45", "average": "7.408", "boardgameexpansion": ["Okko: Era of the Asagiri"], "usersrated": "50", "boardgamefamily": ["Okko"]}, "66632": {"rpgdesigner": ["Tom Tullis"], "rpgitemversion": ["Electronic Version (zipped PDF files)"], "poll": [], "name": "Caverns of Chaos", "rpgartist": ["Tom Tullis"], "rpgproducer": ["Tom Tullis"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic665214.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Fat Dragon Games"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["E-Z Dungeons"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic665214_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Caverns of Chaos provides you with a completely modular cavern construction system.

The size of grid will obviously depend upon the scale of models used.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;To keep the game simple, much of the fine detail of air combat technology has been left out. Modern air combat is highly technical, but there is insufficient hard evidence to suggest the precise relative position of technology and pilot skill. Most writers on the subject are at pains to point out that the pilot's skill is still a significant factor, and it the skill of the player, rather than the technology that I have tried to emphasis here. Obviously, technology cannot be ignored, and in most cases I have tried to reflect the main differences in generic types of weapons and aircraft. Feel free to tinker if such detail that is available is insufficient for you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The rules have designed with the wars of the 1960s and 1970s specifically in mind. They therefore exclude some of the more spectacular weapons developments of recent years.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The game is mainly 2-dimensional, although there is a simplified height- band system to represent general operating heights. A fully implemented 3- D system would be much more complex to operate, and a lot slower in play, and for that reason has not been provided here.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The game is intended to accommodate medium numbers of aircraft, and a single player should have no difficulty in handing 3-5 aircraft at once using the basic rules.

The basic premise is that the player(s) represent fire officers trying to combat fires and deal with emergencies in the critical period of the first London Blitz of September 1940 to May 1941. It is a &lsquo;tactical skirmish&rsquo; game - with individual models representing individual vehicles, and stands of figures representing small groups of fire-fighters and emergency workers.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It also requires a model (or at least a detailed ground plan) of the appropriate scale or the buildings involved. To keep the game manageable I have defined buildings as covering a number of &lsquo;zones&rsquo; - both vertically and in area - and these might cover more than one floor of a building, and ignore much the detail of the internal layout. I have done this to make the game reasonably fast-moving and to keep it simple - there is a wealth of detail; that could be represented, but in my view this would slow the game down considerably.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This game is unusual in that there is no &lsquo;enemy&rsquo; played as such. Player cooperate to solve a difficult (or even insoluble) problem with limited resources - I guess this could be called a &lsquo;multi-player solo game&rsquo;.

Tactical Warfare in the Age of Napoleon.<br/><br/>From the rulebook introduction:<br/><br/>&quot;This system is designed to play out a regimental level battle using 25mm figures in about half an hour or so.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The main design aims were: a. A game that could be understood and played by non-wargamers, b. A game that was very fast moving, c. A game which rewarded the correct historical tactics.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;In order to meet these, in some ways conflicting, objectives some considerable liberties have been taken with operational detail.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The main approach has been to make the system incredibly rapid to play - and all the rules can actually be easily memorised by reasonably experienced umpires after just a couple of games.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Ideally, the game is controlled by someone acting as Game Control (or Umpire) who does not give the rules to the players. This adds some uncertainty play and discouraged player from &lsquo;rules optimising' rather than just getting on ad playing the game.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;In order make it as clear as possible what is going on, the status of the units is shown by labels next to the unit, and players issue orders by using order flashcards. The system does not use dice in combat resolution, which is an approach that is a unusual in most wargaming circles and will come as a bit of shock to conventional gamers.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This does give a slight chess-like feel to the game, and it does mean that a game which follows the same course will always have the same result. Fortunately, no game survives first contact with the players, and the chances of two games being exactly alike is small.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Although the rules were tested using 25mm figures, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter what size models you use, and it might look more realistic to put, say, 15mm or 1/300 scale figures on the same sized base.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "66661": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jim Wallman"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "En Avant En Masse!", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "3", "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic662956_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic662956.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Miniatures", "Napoleonic", "Wargame"], "age": "2", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Subtitled &quot;A One Brain Cell Diceless Divisional Level Napoleonic Battle System&quot;.<br/><br/>&quot;Based on the En Avant! diceless battalion level game, this takes the concept to the next level.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This system is designed to play out a corps battle using 6mm figures in about an hour or so.

Written orders are issued by the players and the results are resolved by the umpire. The players represent command staff at division level or higher. The units controlled by the players are at least battalion sized and each game turn is a half day. The map scale will vary by scenario.<br/><br/>From the rulebook:<br/><br/>&quot;These rules started out as a set of guidelines for the operational megagame Operation Market Garden. This game was run twice, once in 1988 and again in 1993. In the course of these outings, the rules altered and benefited from considerable feedback from participants. The game system I offer here is a distillation of that feedback from users, together with additional thoughts and research.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It is intended as a generic map gaming system for WW2 operations in the Western Europe Theatre, that is, covering operations from Normandy to the Baltic. With some alteration they might be suitable for the campaigns in Italy, although the terrain and operational practices make that theatre sufficiently different to make a rethink of the rules a good idea. The rules are not suitable for the Eastern Front or the Far East. The underlying assumptions vary far too much.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Operation Market Garden was a large and complicated operational game. It involved forces down to battalion level and headquarters up to Corps. When running such a game there is a lot to bear in mind, and the game system has to be robust in order that things progress smoothly. Of course, these rules do not need to be used only in the context of a full sized 100 player megagame -<br/>there are plenty of smaller operations that they could as easily be used for in the context of a club game for half a dozen players.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;In addition to the reasonably straightforward aspects of ground combat the rules consider the problems of air-ground operations (both close support and airborne operations) and logistics (hopefully not quite as boring as some folk make out!).&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "66687": {"rpgartist": ["Ralf Berszuck", "Les Dorscheid", "Susanne Lork"], "statistics": [], "name": "Wunderwelten (Issue 38 - Jul 1997)", "rpgdesigner": ["Stefan Blanck", "Niels Gaul", "Timo Gleichmann", "Ralf Hlawatsch", "Oliver Hoffmann", "Karl Heinz Kieckers", "Rainer Nagel", "Hartwig Nieder-Gassel", "Harald Popp", "Robert Simon", "Michael Stackpole", "Stefan Willkofer"], "rpgproducer": ["Hans Joachim Alpers", "Florian Don-Schauen", "Werner Fuchs", "Guido H\u00f6lker", "Michael Immig", "Dietrich Limper", "Susanne Lork", "Thomas R\u00f6mer", "Frank Werschke", "Tobias Wiersch"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic662675.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Wunderwelten"], "rpg": ["Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)", "Earthdawn (1st Edition)", "Das Schwarze Auge (DSA) (3rd Edition)", "Wunderwelten"], "rpgpublisher": ["Fanpro"], "rpgissueversion": ["Issue 38"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic662675_t.jpg", "description": "(User summary)<br/>Issue 38 of the Wunderwelten magazine, containing:<br/><br/>editorial<br/>news<br/>book reviews<br/>game reviews<br/><br/>Solaris VII - tournament system for Battletch<br/><br/>Ninjas - fiction and reality<br/><br/>Interview with Michael Stackpole about TSR<br/><br/>Alea iacta est - article on dice<br/><br/>shadowrun news<br/>battletech news<br/>earthdawn news<br/><br/>Perry Rhodan CCG: initial card distribution<br/><br/>preview: Perry Rhodan computer game<br/>preview: shadowrun CCG<br/><br/>Star Trek: PSI, power of the mind<br/><br/>DSA-scenario: Hinter den Gedanken<br/>Earthdawn-scenario: Dunkelbarts Grab<br/>CoC-scenario: Ole man river<br/><br/>"}, "66688": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic662920.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jim Wallman"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2005", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgameartist": ["Alodie Fielding"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic662920_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Fantasy", "Miniatures", "Nautical", "Wargame"], "description": "From the designer's website:  &quot;Naval battle game rules for fantasy (or ancient) battle.

Additionally the box contains 126 cards (66 &quot;Pfiffikus&quot;, 30 &quot;R&uuml;ffel&quot; and 30 &quot;Belohnung&quot;), 64 reward marker, 1 bag made of cotton, 8 wooden figurines (4 girls and 4 boys, each in blue, red, yellow and green), 2 wooden dice (one to use and one for replacement) and a rulesheet.<br/>Looking at the components it seems to be a fair simple game of &quot;Roll and Move&quot; (sorry, I don't have the rules). I guess that the shuffled cards have to be placed on the corresponding place on the gameboard from where a card is drawn and read to the player who ended up on a certain space. Each space of the running track shows one of 3 symbols: a question mark, an exclamation mark or an explosion bubble.<br/>The question mark belongs to the Pfiffikus-cards. In this pile you find action cards giving you a special task to perform (like balancing a figurine on your left foot while walking once around the room) or question cards. The player receives reward chips for giving the right answer or fulfilling the action task.<br/>R&uuml;ffel-cards are showing the exclamation mark. On them you find a description of what you might have done wrong (like wasting energy etc.) and the punishment you receive (lose markers, go back etc.).<br/>Cards for Belohnung (meaning reward) are showing the bubble.

That's a plain enough title, isn't it?<br/><br/>This is a role-playing game about the post-apocalypse genre. The post-apocalypse genre, while it has its roots in older speculative and disaster fiction, is one that has only seen real definition in the last fifty years, after the World Wars and during the Cold War. It is one of the few genres to be created in the last few decades, and it has inspired movies, literature, animation, and comics, and it has seen a recent upswing thanks media-inspired fears of an upcoming apocalypse. Is it going to be North Korea? Islamic terrorists? Home-grown loonies? God's wrathful hand? Or maybe it's just going to be the Commies all over again!<br/><br/>While some roleplaying games have covered individual apocalyptic settings, no individual roleplaying game has tried to cover the genre as a whole, doing what Dungeons & Dragons has done for fantasy or Alternity did for science-fiction. In How To Blow Up The World, we present several scenarios for survivable apocalyptic events, and support in both advice to run them, and rules to play them with. The basis of the How-To rule system assumes a (formerly) real-world setting based on real-world technology, such as in Alas, Babylon and Y: The Last Man. However, it also weaves in support for various types of futuristic and supernatural characters and technology.<br/><br/>"}, "66832": {"rpgartist": ["Yehuda Ben Jehoshua", "Jan von K\u00fcgelgen"], "rpgitemversion": ["CD Version", "PDF Version", "Print Edition"], "rpgseries": ["Secrets of Pact Magic"], "name": "Secrets of Pact Magic", "rpgdesigner": ["Dario Nardi"], "rpgproducer": ["Yehuda Ben Jehoshua", "Dario Nardi"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1598611.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "8", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Radiance House"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy", "Occult (Magic)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1598611_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>Tap the Power of Ancient Spirits and Eternal Elements<br/><br/>Lure ancient spirits to bargain for their power.

Players may choose to play to any score they wish - a suggested goal is 92, which is the atomic number of Uranium (the heaviest naturally occurring element).  If the player would like a longer game then an alternate goal could be the atomic number of the heaviest element currently discovered.  Players scores are kept on the periodic table of element.  Play as Carbon(Solid), Oxygen(liquid), Helium(Gas), or Nitrogen(Unknown).<br/><br/>The points scored as players finish building compounds come in two varieties: simple and complex.  Simple compounds are common compounds which are made up of relatively few atoms.  Complex compound are designated as such; either because they consist of more atoms and bonds, or because they are less well known. Complex compounds have the added difficulty of requiring the recipe card to complete.  This also earns the player bonus points.<br/><br/>Once a compound is started it can be completed by any player which means a compound you start out to be Methane (a simple compound) may be turned into Acetic Acid (a complex compound) requiring a recipe.<br/><br/>Cards include single, double and triple bonds, elements, and recipes for compounds.

Keeping this globe-trotting campaign is unfortunately rather a challenge, with scores of NPCs, dozens of locations, hordes of cultists, and at least one very angry Outer God. Needless to say, even the best Keeper could use a little help.<br/><br/>That is where the Masks of Nyarlathotep Companion comes in. Drawing on the wisdom and experience of the members of Yog-Sothoth.com, the premiere site for Lovecraftian role-playing, the Companion gathers together tips and advice for Keepers wishing to run Masks of Nyarlathotep.

To coincide with the 2010 re-release of the classic 1920s set campaign, Chaosium will also publish the Masks of Nyarlathotep Companion, a tome devoted in its entirety to helping a Keeper run all six chapters of Masks of Nyarlathotep. At over 250,000 words in length, the Companion is larger than the campaign itself and has been a three year labour of love for dedicated fans of both Call of Cthulhu and Masks of Nyarlathotep at the website, yog-sothoth.com.<br/><br/>The Companion includes a guide to running each of campaign's six chapters; detailed descriptions of the many tomes and innumerable locations to be found in the campaign; more information about our good friend, Jackson Elias; two extra scenarios set before and during the campaign; adds countless details about the campaign, such as how to handle money, travel, and the replacement of investigators in what is regarded as one of the deadliest of campaigns ever written. To that end, the Masks of Nyarlathotep Companion includes twenty-eight fully written pre-generated investigators all ready to add to the campaign, ranging from a New York Conjurer and a White Russian Folklorist to a French African gun for hire and a German ex-U-boot commander!<br/><br/>"}, "66855": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1850516.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ted Raicer"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Charles Kibler", "Rodger B.

The game components feature a beautiful map from Mark Mahaffey, stretching from Leningrad in the north to the Caucasus Mountains in the south, and around 600 counters representing every major unit that appeared during the course of the conflict. Initially most Soviet infantry are divisions, but as the game progresses these are replaced by armies and corps, so that players are not overwhelmed by the increasing Soviet Order of Battle.  All German mechanized divisions are present in the game, while their infantry is a mix of division and corps.<br/><br/>Although the game is a semi-monster, and covers the entirety of the conflict from the launch of Barbarossa to the end of the war, the game system emphasizes playability rather than rules overhead, allowing the players to concentrate on strategy choices rather than rules minutiae.<br/><br/>The core of the game system is a &ldquo;chit-pull&rdquo; activation system. Each turn a variety of action chits are drawn, in a random order, from the Action Chit Pool, and it is this that determines the exact flow of operations on that turn. [...]<br/><br/>This chit-pull system imposes constant uncertainty upon the player and introduces considerable tension into the game. [...]<br/><br/>The Axis supply network, which imposed crucial restraints upon the effectiveness of the offensive, is represented using supply depot units.[...]<br/><br/>Besides the full campaign game, TDV features scenarios for Barbarossa, Case Blue, Kursk, and the Destruction of Army Group Center. Scenario start dates can also be used to explore shorter versions of the campaign.<br/><br/>The Dark Valley is designed to be playable and exciting, modeling the tension of the campaign elegantly and simply. The game also plays very well in solitaire mode due to the underlying chit-pull system. From the German blitzkrieg in 1941 to the blazing ruins of Berlin, The Dark Valley provides a truly new look at this much-gamed theater.<br/><br/>TIME SCALE: 1 or 2 months per turn<br/>MAP SCALE: 20 miles per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE: Divisions/Corps/Armies<br/><br/>COMPONENTS:<br/><br/>    Two 22x34&quot; maps<br/>    Three sheets of 1/2 &quot; counters<br/>    Four Player Aid Cards<br/>    Two 6-sided dice<br/>    Rules Booklet<br/>    Players Booklet <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>DESIGNER: Ted S.

From the opening:<br/><br/>&quot;We all remember when the Drozan Empire attacked our world. A predatory alternate universe filled with a seemingly endless variety of Creatures, things that caused many to lose their faith and to believe that Lovecraft got it all right, things with powers simply too much for us to deal with. It wasn&rsquo;t a fight so much as a half-hearted resistance, as they took over our world and made it their playground.<br/><br/>&quot;But then, just as our backs were broken, they came. In spaceships of every size, javelin- and disc-shaped, they flew out with powers beyond our understanding. They fought back the Drozan Empire and put out the fires, propping humanity back on its feet. And then... they put themselves at our mercy. They called themselves the Trizgt, and they needed a place to rest.<br/><br/>&quot;In Space Ratgirls Need Our Boys!, you play two teenaged characters: a Trizgt space warrior, and a regular unpowered human. They are a couple (for the time being).  You will alternate between the two roles as the action goes on; the ratgirl exists to take the physical damage and do physical actions, and their human better halves exist to take emotional damage and take social actions. This may take place as a series of cuts.<br/><br/>&quot;The central action of the game will take place in Local City High School (or, optionally, Local City University), where the Trizgt have decided to move in. Your clique consists of the PCs of you and the other players - Trizgt and the people they choose to go out with make a fairly exclusive club, and they tend not to work well as a group with other groups (although individual members may have dual memberships).&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "66869": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jennifer Baker", "Jay Fugiel", "Chris Hussey", "Erik Jameson", "Steve Kenson", "Kevin Knight", "Brenda K.

Your goal is to eliminate your opponents' warriors by strategically attacking them with your men. To accomplish this, you must engage the services of the neutral team (also called the Robot Team). Beware! Because your opponent gains control of the neutral robots on his turn. Both opponents move toward the center power source. Here they many choose to regenerate their forces or decide upon a strategic super attack. Look out! The unseen move can propel you or destroy you. Never give up... comebacks are always possible. Maybe you will be the next TRILOGY master.&quot;<br/><br/>Each player gets a team of six markers, and there is a third &quot;team,&quot; that is the neutral robot. Each turn, players can move one of their pieces and one of the robot pieces. Pieces can move or jump other pieces. Jumping an opponents' piece or a robot piece eliminates that piece. Moving to the center dot on the board allows a player to generate another piece or take an extra turn.

Each new class comes with a complete history and a full 20 levels!<br/><br/>Written by John Walsh, and an extraordinary cover by Carrie Hall, this book takes you new depths with the following:<br/><br/>Playing God - a story written by Martin Jenner that explores the classic battle of good vs. evil!<br/>The Farm Boy - a story written by Melinda Moore that asks &quot;what if a common girl went on a date with a sorcerer?&quot;<br/>Numeromantic Sorcerer - Numeromantic Sorcerers are the masters and mistresses of the use of numbers. Perhaps as child prodigies, they found a natural facility for division, multiplication and all forms of digital manipulation. However, these Sorcerers go beyond the norm when they realize that numbers have not just a mundane meaning, but also a magical one. Words and numbers are but different aspects of the same universal language. Hence, the adept manipulator of numbers can use these to substitute them for the words used in creating magic and casting spells.<br/>Occult Detective - Occult Detectives are the police force of the magical world. Whether they work for an official organization or as freelancers, their intentions are to discover as much as possible about incidents (particularly criminal incidents) in which magic was employed. As a result, they have developed a range of forensic and investigative techniques to assist them in their inquiries. Either working freelance or for an organized agency, Occult Detectives travel the planes seeking answers to puzzles, crimes and enigmas; they also seek to identify, locate and bring to justice any perpetrators of magical crimes. Naturally, this can be a dirty, dangerous, and thankless job because not everybody agrees on the definition of crime.<br/>The Suppresser - There are many people in the world who believe that knowledge and power is best restricted to those who deserve them and who know how to value them. They resent the idea that power, especially magical power, should be available to the common riff-raff. Not only are they resentful, they have the resources to do something about it. One way to keep power for the powerful is the sponsorship of a branch of Sorcerers known as Suppressers.<br/>Immanent Heresiarch - An Immanent Heresiarch is a Sorcerer who believes in the ability of human beings (and to some extent other sentient creatures) to realize a transcendental potential within them that is the equal of or greater than that of any gods known in the multiverse. As a result, according to Immanent Heresiarchs, there is no need for humanity to bow down before the gods but should instead work to rid the world of them. Obviously, this must be done in secret since currently the gods still possess greatly more power than does humanity.<br/>Sixfold Septateuch - Followers of the Sixfold Septateuch are members of a fanatical religious cult that believes in the forthcoming end of existence, and the need for individuals to please the demon god Zhag-Skre through a rigorous meditation and physical disciplines. In a further unusual dogmatic belief, Followers of the Sixfold Septateuch will only accept Sorcerers within their ranks, believing that only those have any chance in surviving beyond the end of the current form of existence, which will begin an era in which seven dimensions will dominate.<br/>Pyramid Mage - a special prestige class that uses the power of the pyramid!<br/>New Sorcerer Spells - Fantastic new spells written by Tony DiGerolamo!<br/>Baubles &amp; Urus - these tiny artifacts are written by The Le are are welcome in any group!<br/>Sorcerer Song - this is an exclusive new mp3 song, produced by our friends at Bailey Records (<a target='_blank' href='http://www.BaileyRecords.com' rel='nofollow'>www.BaileyRecords.com</a>)<br/><br/>"}, "66892": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Big Shot", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "1977", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Children's Games"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic686759_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ideal"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic686759.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "From the Publisher...<br/><br/>Run the pool table.

Aliens can be fearsome world-conquering monsters, or wise and benevolent saviors of our own self-destruction.<br/><br/>&quot;And so, with role-playing games that span the spectrum of genre, from fantasy, to superheroes, to sci-fi, a concise and balanced system for creating and playing aliens must be put forth.   Atomik Alienz presents such as system.  With  Atomik Alienz you can create any creature imaginable from science fiction, fantasy, or horror.

Atomik Deathmatch is  not a gameworld, but simply a set of rules for laying out a quick and dirty &quot;Quake-style&quot; shoot-em-up combat session.  Deathmatch has everything you would come to expect from a Quake-style computer game including Generic Character Types, Frag Counts, Objective Points (for buying new stuff), Respawns when you die, and various game modes such as Teamplay, Capture the Flag, Team Fortress, and the ever popular Deathmatch Free For All.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;So why play Atomik Deathmatch at all when you can just play the latest greatest 3D shoot-em-up?  First, Deathmatch is a great way to demonstrate the combat action potential of the Fuzion system.  It will stress test Fuzion to the max (just like 3D shooters stress test your PC to the max).  If there are bugs in the rules, the game will break (and break hard) in Atomik Deathmatch.  Second, this game is free, and does not require you to have expensive state-of-the-art PCs networked to a LAN with many other computers, all of which you have to upgrade every 3 weeks to keep playing the latest games.  Third, you can do just about anything you can possibly imagine with this game and not have to worry about spending hours programming.   Just do it.  It's as simple as that.  Finally, if you want to introduce someone to Fuzion, Atomik Deathmatch can be the avenue of choice.  It will demonstrate all the rules necessary to play any Fuzion base game quickly and with an excessive amount of fun.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "66902": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Atomik Lifepath", "rpgdesigner": ["Mark Chase"], "rpgproducer": ["Mark Chase"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1176891.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Fuzion"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Atomik Fuzion"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1176891_t.png", "description": "Atomik Lifepath is a random-roll supplement that expands the Champions-centric version of the Lifepath in version 4.4.3 of the core rules into a version that can be adapted to many more genres.  From the opening:<br/><br/>&quot;The idea of the Lifepath goes back to Cyberpunk&trade;, the first and by far most popular cyberpunk RPG.  Its popularity was such that the Lifepath was retained through many of R.Talsorian's games.  Upon the advent of Fuzion, a joint venture between R.Talsorian and Hero Games, Lifepath was revitalized and has become a staple of new Fuzion powered games such as Bubblegum Crisis and Champions: the New Millennium.<br/><br/>&quot;However, the Lifepath system for these products has been custom tailored to its specific universe, and often unsuitable for players wishing to run a new, independent or home-brewed game.  And some Fuzion games, such as VOTOMS, simply lack the Lifepath altogether.  Other players and GMs have seen the need to expand upon the Lifepath, either making it more complete, dynamic, or better integrated with the character design process itself.  Atomik Lifepath strives to address these issues, and presents a suped-up Lifepath that may be tailored to suit a variety of games, and can be made as simple or as complex as the GM may desire.

The speed of movement is recorded with a sliding clip on the side of the card, and adjusted turn by turn as the figures race around the track. The player must pull order out of chaos as his team struggles with opponents to control the ball and score goals.<br/><br/>The movement of figures is affected by the speed and agility of the figure. Complex manuevers, interactions with opposing figures (such as striking and checking) and handling the ball are resolved with dice rolls. As the game progresses, injuries and fatigue will reduce the effectiveness of the team, and play strategy includes decisions about protecting key figures and targeting particular opponents in this full contact sport.<br/><br/>Playing time is extremely long. This is a simulation game requiring book-keeping and attention to detail. Not for everyone.<br/><br/>Game variants allow modified game constraints such as &quot;no penalties&quot; or changes to the time limit.<br/><br/>Free to download from the files section below.<br/><br/>This is fan work.

From the opening of the Eternal Edition:<br/><br/>&quot;In the Age of Eternity...<br/><br/>&quot;Record of Lodoss War is an epic fantasy anime series (Japanese Animation), chronicling the adventures of a party of heroes. Based loosely on the American RPG D&amp;D&trade;, a Japanese RPG called &quot;Sword World RPG&quot; came to life, developed by Ryo Mizuno and Group SNE, and became very popular in Japan. Lodoss War was a supplement for Sword World, and consisted of three books -- Lodoss War Companion I, II, and III. A novel series and manga series (comic book) were written and produced, based on the RPG campaign by Group SNE. In 1991, these stories were finally adapted into a 13 part Original Animation Series (OAV) title &quot;The Record of Lodoss War&quot; (or &quot;Lodoss Island War Record&quot;, in its literal translation).<br/><br/>&quot;Lodoss War RPG uses the Fuzion RPG system, jointly developed by R.Talsorian Games and Heroes Games. Why Fuzion? Fuzion is used in dozens of anime RPG, including Bubblegum Crisis, Usagi Yojimbo, VOTOMS, and Dragonball Z all of which are anime RPGs. It is only logical for Lodoss War, yet another anime series, to utilize the Fuzion mechanics system. Furthermore, the Fuzion core rules are Free, yes free. You need not buy anything, just download the web-book (HTML or .PDF), from the Fuzion Labs Website. Also, please visit my Atomik Fuzion Website and download the<br/>Atomik Magick plug-in, you will need it (all addresses are given on the previous page).<br/><br/>&quot;This is Lodoss War RPG Eternal Edition. The previous Prologue Edition was an early release. The Eternal Edition contains more information and many corrections, including details on monsters and new locations. As back ground, this final edition of the Lodoss War RPG uses OAV episodes 1-8 and the Chronicles series as background material. The events which took place in OAV episodes 9-13 are ignored, as they did not happen as such in Chronicles.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "66945": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Mini Six"], "statistics": [], "name": "Mini Six", "rpgdesigner": ["Phil Morris", "Ray Nolan"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1345945.png", "usersrated": "3", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF"], "average": "7.25", "rpgissuearticle": ["You\u2019re Nicked!"], "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)", "AntiPaladin Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1345945_t.png", "description": "Publisher's description:<br/><br/>Mini Six is a fast and flexible rules system that encourages cinematic play.

In this RPG (Role-Playing Game), a Game Designer or GD for short, hosts adventures that take place within his or her imagined setting. It is the Game Designer's first responsibility to interact with the other Game Players or GPs for short at the table - the players that take on the role of Characters composed of a few cards: one Character Card, one Heritage Card, a Defense Card, a Language and Reputation Card, several Weapon Cards and usually a stack of Items Cards that have been instilled with magical powers.<br/><br/>For an ideal play-experience, there are four to eight Game Players with a single Game Designer running the show. When there are more than eight Game Players, it may be advantageous for the Game Designer to have an assistant helper to be privy of the Game Designer's story and plots. The assistant often takes on the role of an antagonist (such as a monster or foe) by acting out the part to enhance the game. Since the GD has minimal downtime during an active game, the assistant can be useful to allow the Game Designer more time to make on-the-fly adjustments to the game when needed.<br/><br/>The Game Designer first prepares each adventure by coming up with various plot-ideas, and crafts interactive situations that may turn the story from emotional reactions to engaging battles and strategic puzzles. Just like a real storybook, the game wisps Game Players into the universe created by the Game Designer. All Character Cards exposes all ways that Game Player can interact with that particular Character (either played by a Game Designer or the Game Players).<br/><br/>"}, "66967": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Martijn van der Vlag"], "poll": [], "name": "At the Cinema", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Commodity Speculation", "Tile Placement", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic667657_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unpublished)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic667657.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Get the best seating areas in the cinema by driving fellow moviegoers from their seats.
