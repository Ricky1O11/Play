The woods you seem to be exploring are always welcoming, more so during the height of summer; and it was certainly that blessed time of year! The trees surrounding you stretched on endlessly. They seemed young and strong, and had a healthy canopy of rich green leaves surmounting them. The grass at your feet is thick and lightly dipped in morning due. Above you, streaming through countless branches, lays the round of the sun, as it climbs peacefully into the bright blue sky. You walk on through the trees, breathing in fresh air scented with roses and other wild flowers that just sway lazily about you. A slight sound catches your ear and, upon locating its source, you discover it to be a pair of bees gently floating through the air. Then you notice the other sounds about you: birds singing, crickets playing their strange tunes and even the odd frog doing its best to add to the forest chorus.<br/><br/>Things change after a few moments though: the birds cease their calls, as do the insects; even the wind seems quiet. Then the forest around you quickly darkens and chills you. The wind becomes much stronger and dislodges a hail of leaves from the dark woods surrounding you; as if the trees themselves were crying.<br/><br/>So there you stand, alone in the dark, and being taunted by a biting wind and an insurmountable whirl of leaves. Then a cold fear sweeps over you as you notice five dark figures standing silently in the undergrowth ahead of you, and each one of them has their shadowy face tilted in your direction. You stand rooted to the spot, terrified of the nonspeaking forms watching you. You notice that the middle figure stands slightly ahead of the others - perhaps he is their leader? Although you are afraid and seem unable to run or even turn away from the silent group facing you, curiosity still forces you to make a cursory examination of them. None of them appears particularly tall, though they do all seem to be of roughly the same height and, in fact, roughly the same build too. It is about now that you make a chilling discovery because, although the silent group are shrouded in shadows, you can still make out some sort of metal glinting on both their hands and their faces!<br/><br/>You awake bathed in sweat and visibly shaking. You look about you and are glad to find yourself back in the familiar surroundings of your dark bedroom, replete with wardrobe, chest of drawers and, of course, your bed! You sit up and examine the clock beside you - 12:01 am. This is unusual; you have only been asleep for a solitary hour, yet you don't feel remotely tired. You decide to get up, throw some clothes on to protect you from the winter's cold, and head down stares for a little something to eat.<br/><br/>Once down stairs you grab a little snack from the fridge and walk through your dark lounge to turn your TV on, but the only thing that lights its screen is static - on every stinking channel! The aerial must be down, you muse. Never mind though, there's always the good old radio. So you quickly locate it and switch it on, only to be met by white noise - on every blasted channel! What the heck is going on? You flit to the light switches to help illuminate matters, but none of the bulbs seem to work! This is getting ridiculous.<br/><br/>You grab your snack and head back through the shadows, upstairs to your bedroom. Once there, you greedily wolf down the meagre offerings you had previously discovered, then decide to let in a little moonlight by opening your curtains. What you see makes you gasp in shock.<br/><br/>"}, "99504": {"rpg": {"413": "Fighting Fantasy Gamebooks"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Escape Neuburg Keep", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1006113.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"100413": "PDF Version"}, "rpgsetting": {"1743": "Titan"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"156": "Fantasy (Low Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2136": "Solitaire Adventure"}, "rpgseries": {"10604": "Fighting Fantasy Amateur Adventures"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1006113_t.png", "description": "From the Background:<br/><br/>You wake up from a dream in which you were being eaten by a ghoul. All you can remember was hardly being able to breathe, paralysed, and trapped in a cold vault lit by one old candle. This creature that resembled a normal human being at one time was dragging itself on its stomach toward you. Its fingernails were overgrown and stained with old blood and dirt. Its face, and its flesh was grey, and there were dark blemishes blotched across its back from when it had died. The mortis stains hadn't cleared away from beneath its wrinkled skin. All you can recall from this nightmare was its teeth biting into your forearm, your blood leaking out on the floor, and your muscles being gnawed on desperately. The sound of the ghoul biting down onto your forearm bone was what woke you up. The crunch... the gurgling... the hissing delight of laughter...<br/><br/>Fighting off the pit of nausea, you peer around the room you're currently in. Your head is throbbing in pain. It appears to be a cell or a dungeon. Insects scuttle across the floor away from you back into the dark shadows as you come to. Some light from the moon outside is shining in through the barred slit which makes the window, even if you wanted to escape using the window, you wouldn't even be able to fit your head through it. There is a large, heavy door with iron grates set into the stone wall ahead of you. It has no handle, only a tiny keyhole, and a square window with three thick bars across it.<br/><br/>Whoever put you in here had made the intention clear that they did not want you to escape while in their absence. When the headache subsides you are able to get to your feet without suffering from too much dizziness. There is no bedding in here, but unknown lumps in the inky corners, and what looks like straw strewn about. There's another cell door across from your room, and you cannot see anything else left or right but tunnel. There is no noise either. The place is silent.<br/><br/>"}, "99505": {"rpgitemversion": {"100414": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Escape from Phrodite", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1006112.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"163": "Science Fiction (Hard Sci Fi)"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"413": "Fighting Fantasy Gamebooks"}, "rpgcategory": {"2136": "Solitaire Adventure"}, "rpgseries": {"10604": "Fighting Fantasy Amateur Adventures"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1006112_t.png", "description": "From the Background:<br/><br/>Your world once was a place of freedom. Free thought however lead to conflict between the powerful states of the world, this of course lead to war. As world wars waged the wealthy became poorer as governments drained their income to fund their machines of war. Unhappy with their loss the one hundred wealthiest individuals in the world gathered together and formed the Governmental Planetary Contingent (GPC). Their goal: to maintain wealth and luxury through times of war.<br/><br/>As the Great War waged the GPC had no trouble increasing their wealth by offering support to opposing nations. Slowly the GPC drained the whole world of its riches. War soon ended separating the nation into two distinct classes the GPC and the ruined states that remained after the war. The GPC settled on the one piece of land in the world untouched by war - The Phrodite Coast.<br/><br/>Here the GPC set to work creating holiday resorts called institutes. Here members of the GPC could find an escape from the economy and boredom of business. However ten years after the opening of Aphrodite (the first institute) the employees of the GPC rebelled taking over the institute and converting it to a military base. It was with this event that the first ever Warlord declared war on the GPC.<br/><br/>Unequipped for war the GPC saw one solution, to recreate the reasons for fighting. Supplies and weapons were sent out to key individuals in the ruined states who immediately started to gather forces and fight for the resources and rewards offered by the GPC. As Aphrodite lay in the hands of terrorists the GPC, safely at home in their capital at the far north of the Phrodite coast, funded the ruined states warlords more and more. Eventually Aphrodite was attacked and a ruined state warlord took control. By this time the GPC had researched methods of mind control and were able to come up with an addictive pill entitled &quot;The Bless&quot; this would help them retake their prize institute.<br/><br/>The Bless not only allowed the easy control of a large mass of people but it also took away their freedom and control making them slaves of the GPC. Slowly the Bless was introduced to Aphrodite and order was eventually restored. The Phrodite Coast was reopened as the luxury resort it was meant to be some thirty years ago.<br/><br/>Things were working out as planned, the world was at war and the GPC was profiting from selling weapons and goods. One problem arose however; the Bless took incredible amounts of raw resources to be created. These resources were found almost everywhere but the Phrodite coast. As a solution The Bless was introduced to the ruined states, its addictiveness drove the warlords to mine the raw resources needed and exchange them to the GPC for fresh doses of the pill. The GPC was on top again watching the warlords fight among themselves while they sat in luxury in their institutes, gods to their Blessed slaves.<br/><br/>Soon warlords started to become upset by the zombie like effect of the Bless on their troops and a treaty was made among fifty percent of the warlords to ban the pill. This treaty was the start of the Free worlds Government, a group of warlords apposed to and obsessed with the destruction of the GPC.<br/><br/>Today the GPC owns eight institutes along the Phrodite coast. Each under the control of the Blessers: GPC head officers. The Blessers are in competition with one another as the GPC tends to offer more funds and support to those institutes they deem best. Of course the Blessers themselves never take the Bless but are in control of its distribution. Apart from Blesser competition, the Free worlds constantly raid institutes destroying as much of the Bless as they can. The Free worlds have two major goals at the current time, to destroy the GPC and find a cure to the addictive Bless.<br/><br/>You are an employee of the GPC but your life is about to change!

Their main port is a ramshackle, Byzantine morass of back streets, dead end alleys and bizarre twists and turns, so they call it the City of Mazes. They build a university and town serving it and call it Quill. And they build a massive walled redoubt from which foreigners are barred and call it the Forbidden Fortress.<br/><br/>However, you had to admire their black sense of humour. Their largest prison camp is one in which people simply fade away, forgotten by the outside world, unmourned by all. And they call it Oblivion.<br/><br/>Of course, as you grew up in Royal Lendle you had no thoughts of ever entering Oblivion. But you were born at an unfortunate time. As you hit early adulthood Brice's continuous threats on the borders could not be ignored and you were called into the Gallantarian army. You showed a natural aptitude for leadership in your training and were rapidly promoted to a leading command position within your regiment.<br/><br/>However your first taste of action proved disastrous. Your country was ill-prepared, you realize, there was no overall defensive plan and the superbly oiled Brician machine and the army was swept deep into its own territory. Fortunately the Bricians outran their supply lines and had to halt. In the meantime, your troop was sent in advance to prise out a Brician regiment. Although you and your men fought well, you were caught outnumbered and outsourcered and as a result large numbers were captured. The Bricians, cock-a-hoop with their early war success, sent you &ndash; with your commanding officer and a thousand men &ndash; to the square, black stone walled incarceration of Oblivion.<br/><br/>Three years on, you muse, as you scratch the date on the wall of your communal cell. The 30 foot long wooden hut is the home to 100 men, there are a dozen others in the camp more or less full. There are 657 men left still alive. There is little news of the war. Occasionally you hear whispers from the Bricians, they are not optimistic. The guards are being changed with alarming regularity now. Many of the replacements are carrying wounds. You shudder every time you consider how Gallantaria is surviving under such an onslaught.<br/><br/>Maybe the war will be over soon, you muse. The Bricians are brutal and ruthless, but they do not simply kill their prisoners without good reason. Of course a Brician good reason can be refusing to obey an order, or trying to escape, or insulting a Brician soldier, but your commanding officer has instructed your men to keep quiet and ride it out. Eventually you will be returned home, to a free Gallantaria.<br/><br/>You hope.<br/><br/>"}, "99507": {"rpg": {"413": "Fighting Fantasy Gamebooks"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Feathers of the Phoenix", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1006114.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"100416": "PDF Version"}, "rpgsetting": {"1743": "Titan"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"156": "Fantasy (Low Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2136": "Solitaire Adventure"}, "rpgseries": {"10604": "Fighting Fantasy Amateur Adventures"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1006114_t.png", "description": "From the Background:<br/><br/>You press Vincenzo against the wall and punch him across the face again.

You hear Vortigen snickering behind you and you smile as you give Vincenzo a hearty kick in the ribs.<br/><br/>&quot;If you've come to kill me, then finish the job!&quot;, he gasps. You give him a cold stare and smile at him.<br/><br/>&quot;If Branno wanted you dead, you would be&quot;, you gloat, &quot;but as it happens he doesn't want to lose such a valuable friend as you just yet. Consider this your warning&quot;, you finish with another hearty kick in the ribs. Vortigen continues to guffaw at Vincenzo's plight.<br/><br/>Branno, one of Port Blacksand's most powerful and feared crime lords, had asked the two of you to teach Vincenzo a lesson after Branno discovered he had been embezzling some of the money made from burglaries. It strikes you as odd that Branno did not simply wish him dead, he is not known for his mercy and you and Vortigen have killed for him many times before. Perhaps he simply did not want to lose such a competent bookkeeper. Regardless, the job is done now and Vortigen is eagerly going through Vincenzo's drawers in the hope of finding, what he calls his &quot;Hard Work Bonus&quot;. Sadly, there only seems to be a few trinkets of little value, hardly the biggest haul you've ever had. Disappointedly Vortigen continues his rummage... and finds something. From the very back of a small cupboard he pulls out a red feather, glowing faintly in the dim light. On seeing what Vortigen has uncovered Vincenzo awakens out of his dazed stupor and gives a start.<br/><br/>&quot;Leave that alone!&quot; he cries.<br/><br/>&quot;Why? What is it?&quot; demands Vortigen. Vincenzo refuses to answer and gives you a defiant look. However, the fat bookkeeper has been trying your patience too long and you give him a few good kicks to get him talking.<br/><br/>&quot;You can't kill me!&quot; he cries as your kicks break his ribs, &quot;You said so yourself. I'll not talk. You can only hurt me so much without killing me.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You'd be surprised what you can live through&quot;, you reply curtly, drawing your knife and glancing at his ear menacingly. This is more than the cowardly bookkeeper can bear. He reveals that the feather Vortigen is holding is that of a Phoenix, a legendary bird with supposed powers of rebirth. Apparently if four such feathers are collected, it will reveal the location of the phoenix egg, a treasure much more valuable than any gold, as anyone with a phoenix as their pet will gain eternal life.<br/><br/>&quot;I know that one such feather is possessed by the merchant Sylees in Blacksand itself&quot;, Vincenzo continues. &quot;I had hoped to acquire all four and get my hands on that Phoenix Egg, but you have put paid to my aspirations.&quot; The bookkeeper hangs his head dejectedly and you guess that this is all he knows. With a nod and a cruel smile, you and Vortigen leave his house to the murky Blacksand street outside.<br/><br/>&quot;It appears that we are about to embark on quite a quest&quot;, says Vortigen with a devilish glint in his eye. You agree that you should both try to track down the remaining feathers, but one of you should report to Branno first to tell him that Vincenzo has been taken care of for it would not be wise to have an angry Branno on their tails during this enterprise. Vortigen agrees and says he will take the feather and discover the whereabouts of this Sylees, while you report to Branno. You can then meet at the Red Lantern Tavern on Gallows Street at eleven o' clock to discuss your next actions.

Download this visually vibrant and action filled game today to play with your friends, family, or loved ones. Fluke HD represents a digital twist on the board game genre with gameplay in the vein of classics such as Snakes &amp; Ladders, Sorry! and Ludo.<br/><br/>Fluke HD is a virtual board game that requires opponents to employ both strategic play and a healthy dose of luck. Players are each given four colored tokens which they must navigate across any one of the game&rsquo;s many uniquely themed boards in order to win. <br/>A victory can only be achieved if a player is able to get all four of their game pieces across the finish line. Though seemingly straight forward, a variety of different interactive obstacles and surprises await players on each of the game&rsquo;s four board options and no two boards are alike. Users can either play against live opponents or online via Apple&rsquo;s Game Center.<br/><br/>Besides providing customers with engaging and exiting gameplay, another main focus of Fluke HD is to offer users an iPad based board game that utilizes this mobile media to its full potential. The game synthesizes dynamic graphics with smooth gameplay to give players a multiplayer experience that is truly worthy not only of their time but of repeated plays as well.<br/><br/>Because of its painstaking attention to game graphics, playing dynamics, and overall quality, Fluke HD is able to handedly surpass even the most premium board game titles currently floating around on the Apple App Store.<br/><br/>Go ahead, grab a friend and get in on the action with Fluke HD!<br/><br/>&diams; APP FEATURES:<br/>\u2714 Live multi-player capability<br/>\u2714 Apple Game Center integration<br/>\u2714 Fluke HD is OpenFeint enabled<br/>\u2714 4 uniquely themed board layouts<br/>\u2714 AI support with 3 difficulty levels<br/>\u2714 Interactive online leaderboards via OpenFeint integration<br/>\u2714 Un-lockable game achievements<br/>\u2714 Original game music and in-game sound effects<br/><br/>"}, "99561": {"boardgamedesigner": {"6940": {"name": "Inka Brand"}}, "average": "5.91176", "poll": {}, "boardgamehonor": {"24489": "2013 Guldbrikken Best Parlor Game Nominee"}, "name": "Was klotzt du?", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "17", "maxplayers": "12", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1114410_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"6634": "Volker Maas"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3490": {"name": "HUCH!"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1114410.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"100531": "German first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "In Was klotzt du?, the players try to explain a concept using a set of wooden blocks.<br/><br/>The game is played in timed rounds. In each round, one player is the explainer, while the other players try to guess the concept. The explainer receives a set of 24 blocks (consisting of 11 brown blocks and 13 blocks of other colours). He is also given a card which tells him the concept that he has to explain using the blocks. He may not talk or make sounds, though he may move the blocks. He can also give a hint by placing one of his non-brown blocks in one of the circles on the board that show different categories.<br/><br/>If one of the other players successfully guesses the concept, he gets the card and the block used to give a hint (if any). Then, all non-brown blocks are placed aside, and the explainer receives a new card, and continues to explain the new concept with the remaining blocks. This continues until the time runs out, after which the results are scored. The explainer receives points for each concept he has explained, and each other player receives points for each concept he has guessed. Each concept is worth 1 to 4 points, depending on the amount of non-brown blocks that have been set aside. The more blocks that have been used during the round, the higher the value of the concepts.<br/><br/>Now, a new round begins, and the next player becomes the explainer. The game ends after each player has been the explainer thrice; the player who has gathered the most points wins.<br/><br/>"}, "99562": {"poll": {}, "name": "2, 3, 4 Play Air Hockey", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"5628": "Sports: Ice Hockey"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1010025_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"12900": {"name": "Can You Imagine"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1010025.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"100536": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Hit the ice with 2-3-4 Play Air Hockey!

Relatives started pouring out of the woodwork trying for a chance to win Willy's fortune.  You know nothing about trade routes, or pirates, or the galaxy at large... but this is a chance of a lifetime.

Chits include Events which have a timed effect, Goods, Passengers, Enemies which can harass the players or be hunted for bounty, Mined Goods and Ship Upgrades (increase your combat effectiveness or speed).

Players are investors buying private companies in auctions, which they may later use for an IPO (to turn them into corporations) or sell to already existing corporations (to turn them into subsidiaries of that corporation). The majority share holder of a corporation controls its actions: issuing new shares, paying dividends, and buying more subsidiaries from other corporations, players, or an ominous foreign investor.<br/><br/>The companies are transportation themed, starting with the early Prussian railroad. As more companies are bought, the scope of the game expands to Germany, later Europe, and ultimately even space. With expanding scope, older companies become less and less profitable until they have to be written off eventually, severely hitting the book value of their owner.<br/><br/>As a pure card game, Rolling Stock has no game board to simulate actual transportation. Instead, networking effects are modeled by synergies between geographically adjacent companies that are subsidiaries of the same corporation. This simplistic model merely sets the stage for the trading of stocks and companies, which is the heart and soul of the game.<br/><br/>Rolling Stock is vaguely inspired by the 18xx series of games but it is clearly not a part of it. Obviously, track building is missing entirely, but even the stock market with all its superficial similarities turns out to be fundamentally different.<br/><br/>Compared to the 18xx series, Rolling Stock has extremely simple rules.

The player starts off with three reserve cannons. The object is to destroy the mutant aliens and, most importantly, the Mother Creature. The mutants hatch from moving eggs at the top of the screen. Because the Mother Creature replenishes eggs when they hatch or are destroyed, it must be defeated before the player can advance to the next wave. If a mutant or a bomb thrown by a mutant comes into contact with the cannon, the cannon will be destroyed and a reserve must be called up. A new cannon is awarded on every other wave.<br/><br/>An options menu allows a variety of gameplay changes; for example, the player may toggle the shield option on or off. If activated, &quot;shield&quot; mode allowed a player to press down on the joystick to become invincible for a short period (only one shield was allotted per level). Another feature was the &quot;time warp,&quot; which allowed the player to press up on the joystick to temporarily slow down the passage of time for the aliens (i.e., they would move slower than usual). Additionally, the type of shot fired could be changed by activating the &quot;penetrating fire&quot; option (which enhanced the beam fired so that it could withstand hitting two mutants rather than a single one) and/or the &quot;guided fire&quot; option (which caused the beam to be moved with the joystick rather than firing in a straight line).

It was developed for the Atari 2600 video game system.<br/><br/>Dragonstomper follows the adventures of a dragon hunter who is given a quest by the king to defeat a dragon and reclaim a magical amulet that was stolen.<br/><br/>The player makes his way over the countryside vanquishing various monsters and gaining gold and experience. After gaining strength, the player enters a shop in an oppressed village where equipment can be purchased, soldiers hired, and special scrolls obtained to defeat the dragon in its lair.<br/><br/>The final leg of the journey traverses into the dragon's lair where he must avoid a series of traps strewn throughout the cave and defeat the dragon. Defeating the dragon is not required to win; one of the scrolls available for purchase in the town, &quot;Unlock&quot;, can be used to open the gate between the player and the amulet, although it has a chance of failing.<br/><br/>In November 2005, Forbes Magazine named &quot;Dragonstomper&quot; as &quot;The best title ever made in the history of U.S. videogaming.&quot; Forbes singled out the game's ingenuity, noting that &quot;[t]here were multiple ways to solve problems. One could descend to the dragon's lair on a rope or simply jump down (and absorb some damage).&quot;<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>During the first segment of the game (&quot;The Wilderness&quot;), the player's goal is to either collect enough money and valuables to bribe the town guard into letting him pass through, or to find an identity card that will grant him permission to do so freely. Either way, the overworld is a vast open space littered with castles, huts, churches, and other areas that can be explored.<br/><br/>Every so often, a random battle will occur, with the player and enemy taking turns attacking one another until one or the other is dead; if the player expires (accompanied by a faster version of Taps being played), a simple hit of the Reset switch brings him back to life right where he lies, but with all of his collected gold lost and his Strength and Dexterity reset to their normal values.<br/><br/>Experience points do not exist in the game, although every so often, items such as staves, potions, or magic rings will be found in the spoils of battle, or inside of the aforementioned buildings. These items have a random chance of either raising or lowering the player's Strength or Dexterity.<br/><br/>Monsters largely consist of animals, insects and arachnids of various types, as well as humans (Maniacs, Warriors, etc.) Some fantasy-themed creatures, like slimes, also exist. Equipment is only available in the form of an axe and a shield which can be found from various locations or monsters (churches often contain shields). Once the bridge guard permits it, the player can advance into the Oppressed Village.<br/><br/>Three different stores are available to the player there -- a Hospital, a Magic Shop, and an Item Store. Items that are no longer needed from the Wilderness can be sold for extra gold to use to buy new, helpful tools. Like the bridge guard before them, the three soldiers have to be bribed (either with gold, Rubies or Sapphires) to enlist with the player. Furthermore, healing potions, spells to locate and circumvent traps inside the dragon's cave, and miscellaneous goods (like ropes and bow and arrows) are available for purchase. Once the player feels ready, he can enter the Dragon's Cave, which is preceded by a few bars of In the Hall of the Mountain King.<br/><br/>The Dragon's Cave is simply one long, narrow hallway lined by jagged rock protrusions, with no monsters to fight; the primary danger is traps. Two varieties exist -- poison darts which fly back and forth in one set line, and invisible floor panels which, when stepped on, trigger an unavoidable burst of flash damage. These panels can be detected with a spell, while the darts can simply be run past. Succeeding in navigating the cave's dangers will result in coming upon a pit in the floor which leads to the dragon himself.<br/><br/>The fight with the dragon alternates with the player-character and the dragon taking steps towards one another in turns. If the player has recruited any of the soldiers, they march of their own accord up to the dragon to help serve as a distraction and occasionally dealing (and being dealt) damage. With the aforementioned &quot;Unlock&quot; spell, it is still necessary to successfully get past the Dragon and reach the amulet in its secluded chamber; without this spell, defeating the dragon is the only key to victory.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Dragonstomper&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "99639": {"poll": {}, "name": "Soccer Pontoon", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "yearpublished": "1938", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"5551": "Sports: Football / Soccer"}, "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1415703_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"9330": {"name": "W.

Your mystical influences will link these lounge-goers into social cliques that give you access to the coolest party-people that all the hipsters want to be near. Mix a few drinks, rack up the magical monkey points, and crown yourself king of the Swinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge.<br/><br/>Score monkeys to hang on your martini glass by adding Jivecat contacts to your clique and claiming Trend cards through skillful manipulation of your lounge contacts. Be the player with the most monkeys at the end of the round in which a player scores their fifteenth monkey and be crowned the winner!<br/><br/>Players are dealt a hand of four cards and on their turn use those cards for their face value to claim low-brow contacts in the lounges or use the card's special powers to claim Jivecat contacts and cast spells (Zombie, Rada, Cheval, and Voodoo).  For example, a 4 Zombie can be used to claim a &quot;4&quot; contact in the Lava Lounge. Card values can be added and subtracted from each other, allowing players to pinpoint just the right contacts to advance their plans.<br/><br/>However, the player could use the card for its Zombie spell, instead. By paying a skull, they can place the card in their tableau as an extension of their hand allowing them to use that card's value for many turns in the future.<br/><br/>In these ways, players create &quot;cliques&quot; of linked contacts in and among the four cocktail lounges (Lava, Cocoa, Tiki, and Neptune) trying to schmooze their way to the Jivacat contacts that score points. The contacts are limited though, so several players may be angling for a specific Jivecat.<br/><br/>During play, a series of Skull Cards allow players to gain skull token reward that power their voodoo spells, and a Trend Card track presents players with monkey rewards for achieving specific contact configurations. The Trend cards also provide special bonus abilities to the players if they can maintain the required configurations.<br/><br/>Each player has a martini glass to hold the contact chips and scores are kept through hanging cocktail monkeys on the rim of the player's glass. Orange monkeys are 1 point and blue monkeys are 5 points.<br/><br/>Game end is triggered when one player reaches fifteen monkey points. The round is completed, bonus monkeys are rewarded for trends that have been maintained, and the player with the most monkeys wins.<br/><br/>To add to the cocktail themed fun, each card also has a different cocktail recipe for adult players to mix and enjoy.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"100724": "English first edition"}, "average": "6.62718", "name": "Swinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "21", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "142", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "99656": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Fantasy Chronicles (Issue 8 - Feb 1987)", "rpgproducer": {"44722": "Ian Brown"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1006254.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"7308": "Fantasy Chronicles"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"49167": "Battlefield"}, "rpg": {"358": "Golden Heroes"}, "rpgissueversion": {"100725": "Issue 8"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1006254_t.jpg", "description": "Vol. I, No. 8<br/>Cover Artist: Jim Fitzpatrick<br/><br/>"}, "99657": {"poll": {}, "name": "Snap Shots", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1930", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1006997_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3320": {"name": "(Unknown)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1006997.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"100726": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1027": {"name": "Trivia"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A question and Answer game with 96 question cards.

Each motorcycle in the game handles differently with some performing better on paved roads and others working better on rougher terrain.<br/><br/>There are a number of different modes: Grand Prix (GP), Motocross, and Traffic. GP takes place at a number of different locations across the world on paved tracks in places such as San Francisco and Russia. The paved tracks require the player to learn how to effectively use their brakes around corners. The GP courses contain small differences between them, giving more variety to the courses in the game. Motocross requires the player to drive on off-road terrain and to master the act of &quot;powersliding&quot; on corners. The courses found in Motocross races are less hospitable and often take place in arid and unkept locales and with obstacles. Traffic mixes both GP and Motocross, having mixed pavement courses and traffic on roads that serve as obstacles.<br/><br/>There are three different methods of gameplay: Championship, Progression, and Single Race. The single race mode must be earned through playing the progression mode. Progression is the game's &quot;main mode&quot; and places the player in a number of different tournaments and races in all three racing styles. It allows the player to earn hidden content, including new bikes which handle differently.

This game simulates a space flight in which you must pilot your ship to destroy the Dracon invaders. It makes use of many of the Atari 2600's console controls to simulate various aspects of piloting your ship.<br/><br/>Programmed by Dennis Caswell, Phaser Patrol can be compared to other 2600 space flight games such as Atari's own Star Raiders and Star Ship, Imagic's Star Voyager, and Activision's Starmaster. Phaser Patrol was originally sold along with the Starpath Supercharger for a price of $44.95.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The game must first be loaded into the Supercharger by a typical cassette recorder. When the intro screen appears, the user is allowed to set the game's difficulty via the console's right difficulty switch. Position A on the 2600 sets the game to high difficulty for experienced players. As with other Starpath games, setting a higher difficulty will award extra bonus points if the player can successfully complete the game's objectives.<br/><br/>The player has two screens available. The Sector Map shows locations of all the sectors. It shows the contents of some sectors as well. Friendly starbases are shown automatically at the game's start. Other sector contents are revealed as the player explores. Unexplored sectors are usually scanned when a player warp-hops into an adjacent sector.<br/><br/>The second screen is the Combat Action Screen. This screen features a large window through which the player views the action. In the middle of the window is the Lock On Sight and the Rangefinder, which aid the player in making successful torpedo shots.<br/><br/>At the bottom of the Combat Action Screen is the Instrument Panel. Two large squares on either end of the Instrument Panel show a color that corresponds to the sector's contents. Next to the squares are four stripes which indicate the status of four of your ship's systems. From top to bottom, they indicate status of the ship's shields, computer, long range scanners, and torpedoes. In the middle of the Instrument Panel is the computer display. It shows a map of the sector with locations of Dracon starfighters. The display also shows how much energy is remaining, how much energy a warp-hop would consume, and how much time has elapsed in the current game.<br/><br/>During the course of gameplay, it is possible for the player's ship to be damaged by enemy fire. Such damage will cause the player to lose energy units and could cause damage to the ship's systems. Damaged systems do not function properly and must be repaired to restore normal operation. Damage to the ship also increases the likelihood of the ship being totally destroyed. When the ship is damaged or low on energy, a visit to one of your starbases will repair all damage and restore all energy. If the ship is destroyed, the game ends.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Phaser Patrol&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>Game Manual<br/><br/>Your mission: Fly your interstellar interceptor like you never flew before... because only you stand between the Dracon armada and their cruel objective.<br/><br/>The situation: Serious trouble.

Every player is dealt eight cards, so that no cards remain undealt. Then, each player, starting from the dealer's right and proceeding counter-clockwise, bids in an auction to declare how many points they will score. A player may pass, and hence cannot bid again in that game. The bid represents the number of points that player believes he is capable of accumulating. Bidding continues until all but one player have passed in a round. This remaining player has then &quot;won the bid&quot; and therefore gets to declare the Briscola, i.e. the trump suit. The declarer also declares a specific Briscola card (example, the &quot;Ace of Cups&quot; if Cups was the declared Briscola) and the holder of this card is then determined to be the declarer's partner. Logically, the declarer would  declare the highest Briscola card he does not already hold in the hopes of creating the strongest combined hand between him and his partner.<br/><br/>The remaining three players are partnered with each other, without their knowledge. Each player, other than the declarer's partner, acts independently, until it is clear which players are partners. Infrequently, the declarer may declare a Briscola card he already holds (if he feels he has a very strong hand), in which case the other four players are partenered against him.<br/><br/>Because of the unique method of declaration and blind partnering in this variation of the game, it is considered to be one of the most entertaining variations of the game.

If a two (the lowes card) is bid, players start bidding the point total they must earn to win the match, starting from 62 (since 61 is the minimum possible to win during normal bidding). Then, the last bidder may declare the suit of the Briscola. In this version, the objective is for the declarer and his partner to earn at least 61 points, or the amount of points bid by the declarer, if the auction got to that phase.<br/><br/>"}, "99697": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Trainz Railwayz", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"100795": "NA Windows Edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"7002": "Trainz"}, "videogametheme": {"2473": "Commercial / Public Transport"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2156": "Simulation"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "From the back of the box<br/>...The most powerful and fully featured train simulator released to date.

These artifacts were alledgedly hidden by a secret order in various mythical places, and hardly has the first information about this treasure been leaked before archaeologists and adventurers race off to try to discover this artifact before anyone else can.<br/><br/>In Artefakt, each player starts with three experts (game pieces) to send on a treasure hunt, using dice and cards to try to get them to the most rewarding locations in order to find fragments of artifacts. Each round, after rolling the dice and laying out new fragments to discover, players secretly assign one of their four movement cards (numbered 1-4) to each of their three experts. In turn order, players reveal the first card, move that figure clockwise or counterclockwise that number of spaces around the circle of ten tiles, then reveal the second card, and so on.<br/><br/>Once all experts have moved, the tiles are resolved in numerical order. Any player who stands on a tile with no competition takes all the fragments located there; if more than one player is on a tile, the player with the most experts either takes all the fragments on that tile or one face-down fragment from another player on that tile. After a player takes or steals fragments, he can choose to use the special power on that tile: break a tie in your favor on another tile, take a fragment from the pool, move one expert owned by another player one space, and so on.<br/><br/>In the basic game, only four of the tiles are face-up with active powers; in the advanced game, these same four tiles start face-up but at the end of a round the starting player turns one tile of his choice face-up before passing the starting player marker.<br/><br/>As soon as one player collects all four different fragments of one artifact, he wins

According to the author Barth, it was based on his earlier game Infinifrag, Team Fortress, and Motherload by XGen Studios.<br/><br/>Barth wrote InfiniMiner in his spare time and released it in steps of incremental updates during April&ndash;May 2009. It quickly garnered a following on message boards around the internet.<br/><br/>Infiniminer was originally intended to be played as a team-based competitive game, where the goal is to locate and excavate precious metals, and bring your findings to the surface to earn points for your team. However, as the game gained popularity, players decided it was much more fun to build things than to compete for points.<br/><br/>Zachtronics discontinued development of the game less than a month after its first release as the result of its source code leak. As Barth had not obfuscated the C# .NET source code of the game, it was decompiled and extracted from the binaries. Hackers modified the code to make mods, but also started making clients that would target vulnerabilities in the game as well as build incompatible game forks that fragmented its user base. Barth who was making the game for free then lost interest and dropped the project as it made development of the game hard to push forward. The source code of Infiniminer is now open and available under an MIT License.<br/>The game is particularly notable as it is the original game that the hit indie game Minecraft is based upon (and subsequently Fortress Craft, CraftWorld and Ace of Spades). The visuals and mechanics of procedural generation and terrain deformation of Minecraft were drawn from Infiminer. According to Minecraft author Markus Persson, after he discovered the Infiniminer, he &quot;decided it was the game he wanted to do&quot;. As a result, if one plays Infiniminer, one can note that the visuals of blocky graphics and carving out voxel blocks as a miner are practically identical.<br/><br/>As Minecraft became popular, Infiniminer was overshadowed and faded into obscurity. Barth's feelings about Minecraft are complicated. As Minecraft is probably biggest indie game to date in terms of sales, he finds it &quot;flattering&quot;, &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;awesome&quot;, because it was based on something he made.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Zachary Barth&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "99728": {"boardgamedesigner": {"58846": {"name": "Mitchell Kimmes"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Storm the Keep", "playingtime": "5", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "1", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1043121_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"17118": {"name": "Oblique Diversions, Inc."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1043121.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"100851": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "5", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "5", "description": "Storm the Keep! is a fast paced solo card game of medieval conquest.<br/><br/>Attacker and Keep Defender decks consist of four ranks in five suits.

The sensation created by the &quot;Dear Boss&quot; letter is one that has been imitated by later serial killers to the point that sending taunting letters to the media and police has become one of the signatures of the true serial killer.<br/><br/>This short Blood and Relics (2nd Edition) sourcebook presents the Redjacks, a cult that worships &quot;Saucy Jack&quot;, a creature of pure hate. They kill at his behest, killing women, disemboweling or beheading them and performing the rituals of sacrifice on the streets themselves.<br/><br/>Your job? Stop the Redjacks if at all possible.

Playing cards will impact, among other things, the ranking of the Houses in terms of prestige. To optimize point scoring, a good player will try to gain influence over &quot;winning&quot; houses without wasting too many cards for acheiving that, and/or to influence Houses in the lower positions with little effort.

You play as one of the great monarchs from 17th and early 18th century Europe representing one of the seven top powers of the era: Austria, England, France, Poland, Russia, Spain, or Sweden. Your objective is to be recognized as the most prestigious monarch by producing the most admired art and culture, lead the continent in scientific innovations, spread or resist the spread of Catholicism, and attempt military expansion beyond your historical borders. All of this is accomplished by marshaling 134 historical &quot;luminaries&quot; &ndash; important historical figures covering every relevant domain of human achievement during the period.<br/><br/>The luminaries are rated in between one and seven different areas of endeavour: military, politics, religion, ideas, science, art, or wealth. Additionally, each luminary has a unique Action, Enhancement, or Response based on their real historical achievements to be brought to bear in service of your nation.<br/><br/>Consider the difference between Rembrandt and Vermeer: Both are important and wonderful artists, but in the real-life Dutch Republic, Rembrandt was famous and well-patronized, composing hundreds of celebrated portraits in his career. Vermeer was obscure and produced an order of magnitude less art in his career. In Road to Enlightenment, Rembrandt has higher ratings and gives you a benefit every single time another luminary is removed from the game, reflecting the influence and nature of his portraiture. On the other hand, Vermeer provides only a modest benefit to reflect the limited impact his career had at the time.<br/><br/>Invading other countries in the 17th century was a complex mix of cultural, religious, and logistical considerations. These have all been baked into the various territories on the map, making it quick and easy to make decisions around where to try to attack:<br/><br/><br/>     You can attempt to invade only those territories that have your nation's colour on the top of the circle. Those are the only nations that could have even possibly successfully invaded that territory in real-life.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     The number associated with each nation's colour indicates how difficult it would be to successfully conquer. In the case of London, it is very difficult for Spain, France, or Sweden to conquer it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     The religious symbol in the lower left corner lets the player know whether the territory is primarily Catholic, primarily Anti-Catholic (Protestant, Russian Orthodox, and other Christian branches), or primarily Islamic. If it is successfully invaded by a nation with a different religious affiliation, it has an impact on the continental struggle between religions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     The lines connecting into London, and the anchor with an &quot;A&quot; in the lower right corner, indicate which territories need to be held by a player before they have access to attack. The anchor with an &quot;A&quot; indicates that any player who already owns another Atlantic port territory is connected and could choose to attack over the water.<br/><br/><br/>With Road to Enlightenment, all of the intricacies related to managing military expansion have been baked into these easy-to-use board mechanisms.<br/><br/>In order to create a game that simulates the battle between nations for prestige &ndash; covering war, politics, religion, science, and art &ndash; while focusing on many of the diverse people of history, we've mashed up aspects from wargames, Euro games, deck-building games, and statistical sports simulations.

The overture box comes with four stories, one each based on the Biblical stories Deborah and Barak, David and Goliath, the Seven Seals, and Joseph and his dream coat. An expansion available from BoardGameGeek in July 2011 has the story of resettling Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. 100 stories are planned in total.<br/><br/>A game turn in Crossroads starts with rolling dice to determine how many tiles you'll have available to lay on the grid board during your turn, and how many spaces (tiles and challenge cards being the spaces) you can move your traveler disk. When you end your movement on a challenge card, the card may have something it does in the game right away. Either way, you'll want to &quot;face&quot; the challenge. This can include needing have have stats at a certain level (others on the same space can add their stats to yours), giving up a resource you've gained during the game, rolling dice and adding to them based on various criteria, and more. Each player also has a number prayer cards which will help in facing challenges. Players can use some prayers only on themselves, while others may be used on any traveler.<br/><br/>Each story is a little different in the way it plays. What you need to do to gather resources and what you need to do with them once you do can be different, as well as what it is that's pushing you along.<br/><br/>Since this is a cooperative game, the players are facing the board rather than each other. The thing that there are facing in each game is represented by a lion playing piece that travels the board effecting players in one way or another. How the lion moves about and what it does to a traveler when it finds one is different (and themed appropriately) in each story.<br/><br/>The game's re-playability comes in the random, face-down layout of challenge cards, that you only put out 7 of the 9 challenge cards a story has when you play (leaving a mystery two out of each session), and that you can pick which prayer cards you will have with you before each session.<br/><br/>The publishers were involved in Anachronism, so the cards have excellent, historically-accurate artwork, and the game is very true to the Bible, while being nondenominational and not preachy.

Each player places two toppings on the game board in the spaces designated with an X.<br/><br/>In each round, the three players take turns placing one topping on the game board; that topping cannot be placed adjacent to any of that player's other toppings. Each player then secretly chooses a number (1-6) on his die; players reveal the numbers and lay their pizza cutters on the board in the space matching their number. The cutters divide the pizza into one of 216 possible outcomes, creating a number of slices. In each slice if a player has more toppings than each opponent, he replaces those opponent's toppings with his own; if two players tie for the most toppings, the toppings of the third player are removed but not replaced; in a three-way tie, nothing changes. (NB: If a player has at most one topping in each slice, then his toppings cannot be removed or replaced this round.)<br/><br/>Whoever first places his 16 toppings on the game board wins.<br/><br/>With only two players, the cutter and toppings of the third color are still used, with players taking turns placing those toppings on the board.

The player plays as Sarge, the protagonist for many of the Army Men games. The player travels through several missions, completing objectives, killing enemies, destroying vehicles, and rescuing people. The plot starts out as the Tan Army is invading the Green Army base. Sarge rescues Colonel Grimm and they evacuate the base in a helicopter. In the game, Sarge discovers portals that lead from the &quot;plastic world&quot; to the &quot;real world&quot;. The Tan Army is getting &quot;Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot; from the &quot;real world&quot; (toys and ordinary objects, i.e. magnifying glass). Throughout the game, Sarge rescues commandos of his own unit, Bravo Company. Sometimes they are in Tan bases, and other times he has to go through portals and save them from the &quot;real world&quot;. To avoid the destruction of the Green Army, Sarge must destroy the portals and stop Plastro.<br/><br/>Boot Camp is a training level, based on the actual United States Marine Corps Recruit Training. Boot Camp consists of training areas for all weapons, an obstacle course, and a &quot;live fire course&quot; in which Sarge is shot at.<br/><br/>Multiplayer<br/><br/>In 2-4 player multiplayer (only 2 players in the Playstation and PC), players choose their character, faction, and difficulty.

Each world is divided into five stages, with each stage divided into four levels. The general goal of each level is to collect a certain amount of gold to activate a portal that allows the player to continue. As the player progresses, each world adds new interactive objects and tools, as well as new obstacles.

A descendant of NBA Jam and NBA Hangtime, Showtime is modeled after the NBA presentations on NBC. The original arcade version features team rosters from the beginning of the 1998-99 NBA season, while the console versions features team rosters that were accurate prior to the 1999-2000 NBA season. A newer &quot;Gold&quot; version for arcades features another roster update from later in the 1999-2000 season.<br/><br/>Rather than 5 on 5 action like professional play, this game features 2 on 2 play with the ability to pick two players from any NBA team's starting line-up for the first half and can choose again for the second. In addition, after a player makes 3 consecutive shots he becomes &quot;on fire&quot;, which allows him to easily make shots from almost anywhere, as well as goaltend without penalty and push opponents without being charged a foul. Play otherwise is similar to NBA rules. The arcade version accommodates up to 4 players, as do the home versions produced for the Nintendo 64, PlayStation and Dreamcast.<br/><br/>The players featured in the game included many of the most popular players of the particular year and era of the NBA season. But, like the previous games in the arcade-style basketball series&mdash;many players were left out and each team has a limited amount of players per position to chose from for the 2 on 2 gameplay.<br/><br/>As with the previous NBA Jam and NBA Hangtime games, the game contains many secret characters. The arcade version features the Universal Monsters Frankenstein's monster, Bride of Frankenstein, The Mummy, The Wolf Man and Creature from the Black Lagoon as secret characters.<br/><br/>Several Midway Games employees are also playable characters. Some of the available players include Mark Turmell, Rob Gatson, Mark Guidarelli, Dan Thompson, Jeff Johnson, Jason Skiles, Sal DiVita, Jennifer Hedrick, Eugene Geer, Matt Gilmore, Tim Bryant, Jim Gentile, John Root, Jon Hey, Andy Eloff, Mike Lynch, Dave Grossman, Larry Wotman, Tim Moran, Willie Morris, Greg Cutler, and Chad Edmunds.<br/><br/>The game-time commentary is particularly varied and colorful for basketball games of that period, featuring such phrases as &quot;The dejection of the rejection!&quot; &quot;He just flat-out leveled him!&quot; as well as &quot;With the silky smooth move!&quot; and &quot;Look Ma, no rim!&quot;<br/><br/>The original announcer from NBA Jam, Tim Kitzrow, returned, after Midway used the Bulls radio announcer Neil Funk in NBA Hangtime. Jon Hey produced all the sound, music and script save for the NBC basketball theme Roundball Rock by John Tesh. At the time, the music was influenced by 2Pac and Dr. Dre's California Love and Master P's Make 'em say uhh and previous NBA Themes written by Jon Hey for NBA Jam and NBA Hangtime.<br/><br/>The N64 version of the game received mixed reviews, receiving a score of 6.8 on GameSpot.com<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "99928": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Airforce Delta", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"101269": "French/Italian/German Dreamcast edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1010480.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2317": "War - Modern"}, "usersrated": "2", "average": "4.5", "videogamegenre": {"2295": "Flight Simulator"}, "videogameplatform": {"4424": "Game Boy Color"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1010480_t.jpg", "description": "Airforce Delta, known as Deadly Skies in Europe, is a video game released in 1999 for the Dreamcast. It was both developed and published by Konami.<br/><br/>The game is a 3D aerial combat simulation, featuring many jet fighter aircraft. The game is single player only and has been compared to Ace Combat by GameSpy and GameSpot. At the time of the game's release, Airforce Delta was the only combat flight simulation game available for the Dreamcast.<br/><br/>A Game Boy Color version of Airforce Delta was also released in 2000.<br/><br/>A sequel called Airforce Delta Storm in North America (Airforce Delta II in Japan and Deadly Skies in Europe) was also released for the Xbox platform in 2001 and for Game Boy Advance in 2002.<br/><br/>A second sequel called Airforce Delta Strike in North America (Airforce Delta: Blue Wing Knights in Japan and Deadly Skies III in Europe) was released for the PlayStation 2 in 2004.<br/>Airforce Delta features simplistic controls with an emphasis on arcade-style action rather than accurate flight simulation.<br/><br/>The mission briefings are complete with an illustrated step-by-step guide which shows you your designated targets and the ideal path to take. After completing a mission, players are awarded with money that can later be used to purchase superior aircraft. Variables such as mission completion time and the number of enemies you have disposed of dictate the amount of money you will receive. When making a buying decision, choosing an aircraft most appropriate for the job is of the utmost importance. The most expensive does not necessarily mean the most practical.<br/><br/>Missions typically involve either seeking out and destroying the enemy or escorting friendly craft to a certain destination. The enemies encountered in Airforce Delta are diverse and range from air to ground and water capabilities and from offensive to defensive situations.

They possessed mystical powers capable of both good and evil. The most respected influences in the land were from the good Sorcerers. This fact continually disturbed the evil Wizards, and they eventually decided to use their power to conquer the countryside and enslave its people. They devised a plan to systematically eliminate the good Sorcerers by sending wave after wave of diabolical creatures to ravage the world.<br/><br/>As the bravest of the good Sorcerers you have been asked to destroy these forces and save the planet. As a reward for your bravery: whenever you overcome or destroy a creature, you will receive a treasure.<br/><br/>Knowing your bravery the Wizards have done everything within their power to keep you from succeeding. They don't believe you will survive their first three waves of evil, but just in case you do they have several surprises waiting, Only you can discover through bravery and talent how evil they can become.<br/>To give you more power over the Forces of Evil the good Sorcerers have provided a magical Flying Platform. When you start on your journey you should first catch this elusive platform. You can continue without it, but only the foolish would dare to do so. Once on the Flying Platform you can go anywhere on the screen to avoid or destroy the enemy. The good Sorcerers have also given you four lives to use against the Forces of Evil.<br/><br/>SCORING is done by hitting the Forces of Evil with an energy charge and picking up treasures. Each time you hit a force of evil with your energy charge you get 30 POINTS. When they disappear a treasure will materialize. Touching the treasure gives you 80 POINTS. Successfully moving through the lightning storm will cause a treasure to come out of the sky. Don't forget to pick up each treasure since once you have moved to the next screen you can't go back.<br/><br/>DIFFICULTY is determined automatically by your score after you select the Practice, First Level or Second Level of difficulty. In the Practice Level you are able to get into every screen meeting all of the Forces of Evil. In the First Level of difficulty you must achieve higher scores before you gain access to more Forces of Evil and Treasures. When the game begins you have three different screens in which to move. These screens repeat until you reach 1000 points at which time another screen containing more Forces of Evil opens. With each additional 1000 points earned another screen with additional Forces of Evil opens. After 4000 points are earned surprising things start to happen to one of the sets of Forces of Evil. With each additional 1000 points the changes continue making the game harder and harder. Only truly great game players will discover what finally happens to the Forces of Evil before you reach the ultimate score of 9999.<br/>The Second Level of difficulty has the same features as the First Level but all of the Forces of Evil are much more evil.<br/><br/>"}, "99945": {"boardgamedesigner": {"33591": {"name": "Alain Boudreault"}}, "average": "5.18182", "poll": {}, "name": "Big Boss", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "3", "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "11", "boardgamefamily": {"131": "Climbing Games"}, "maxplayers": "12", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1311975_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"33593": "Jean-Patrice Tremblay"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3396": {"name": "Les jouets BOOM, Inc."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1311975.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"101295": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "A super variation on the popular card game &quot;President&quot; (See also &quot;Scum: The Food Chain Game &quot;).

In the Ancient World ('Kingdoms and AntiKingdoms Division Age), the Summoners (you) own several decks. The basic one is the Duel Stack that consists mostly of Figures  and Characters which belong to the Eragra Saga as well as several new Card Leagues such as Ploys Ad Hoc (Artefacts n' Constructions), Relics, Walls, Incantations and many other. The next 2 Stacks are the Mastery (10 cards) and the Grim (15 cards) one where you must Unfold, meaning you cannot use them from the beginning of the Duel. The rest of the cards form a Common Space which can be used by all the Summoners! There, a War of Incantations and Artefacts take place and the most powerful combinations with Minions wins<br/><br/>Purpose in the Ancient World is to send as many Rival Minions as you can, to Limbo, in order to collect as many as you can from your Crystals (max. 25). The next step is to enter the Future World which can be done by activating 1 specific card from your Mastery Stack, a Vortex called Cyberspace. You can enter there any time you want but will you have enough Crystals? If you enter the Future World, then the rest Summoners must follow you with the Crystals they have collected from the first phase. Tough balance? No, the game in the Future World is totally different and much faster. In this world all change, so the rules.<br/><br/><br/>     The Future Stack is divided in 4 parts. Each Summoner owns a Stack of 30 cards. The cards you handle here are Viruses, Machines, Weapons, Ambushes, Resources &amp; Future Survivors. Here you use your collected Crystals. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Each Future card has the sing of a Crystal along with a number. For example you may have a Hybrid Machine and on it the Crystal sing and the number 3. Since you activate this card, place the equivalent Crystals on it. That means, your rivals have to beat this card thrice. Following this way, this Machine will be destroyed. Each time the rival wins a small battle, you remove a Crystal from your card and gives it to him. This world is faster since the Machines are moving in each round and carry dangerous tools capable of the ultimate destruction.. here the Duel here may last...few minutes!! <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Final Goal' of the Duel is to remove by any mean the Crystals from your rival(s) or to destroy their Future Survivor (there are 4 Future Survivors (1 for each one of you): A Hacker, a Cybermage, a Rebel and a member of the Torrius Syndicate who are protected by your Machines). <br/><br/><br/>In this game you will find more and more things to discover while you play. The point is to combine your cards well. You will enjoy it more, if you play with more than 1 rival and then you will face the brutality of Eragra. You can create Alliances with a rival Summoner to defeat another, but at the same time you must defeat your ally too. Your only true ally is your Minions.

On these paths 9 chits (5 gemstones, 4 other chits) are openly laid. Each player gets 6 cards, the remaining 21 are put in a central card pile. Players lay one card on a private pile of a certain colour. The piles can be ascending or descending, but this choice can only made once. Once a card is legally added to a pile the player can choose to advance one of his playing pieces on one of the paths on the board. If one playing piece reaches a chit the chit is removed and gives points or if its a gemstone can be taken by the player. When the public card pile is exhausted the game is over. Players get points according to the advancement of their playing pieces (-2 to +10 points are possible on each path) and for each gemstone they collected (0 gemstones = -3, 1 gemstone = -1, 2 gemstones = 2, 3 gemstones = 3 4 gemstones = 6, all 5 gemstones = 10 points).

Political alliances have long since dissolved as each power block struggles for survival. In this declining world, technological advancement has ground to a halt, while the world&rsquo;s armed forces make do with the weapons available from bygone decades.  You enter this desperate struggle for survival as the leader of one of the six remaining factions.<br/><br/>Game Design<br/><br/>Global Domination uses the &quot;deck Building&quot; game mechanic used by some popular recent games like Dominion.<br/><br/>Deck building is very cool. It takes all the good and none of the bad from collectible card games. In a deck building game, you lay out the different types of cards on the table, and everyone starts with the same handful of cards. As the game plays, you get to select which cards on the table you wish to add to your individual deck, thus creating your own means of winning the game.   To add an additional decision point, deck building games might come with 20 card types in the box, but you randomly select 12 for any given game.
