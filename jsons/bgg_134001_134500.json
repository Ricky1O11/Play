Once placed on the board, mushrooms have the capacity to spawn endless copies of themselves in different directions. Players struggle for supremacy by growing, defending and capturing mushrooms.<br/><br/>Players take alternating turns to play. On each turn a player places one mushroom of his colour on an empty square on the board. Before placing the mushroom, the player chooses the direction of the mushroom to be up, down, left or right; the direction is indicated by an arrow on the mushroom. After playing the mushroom the player's turn ends and his mushroom(s) will now spawn: each of his mushrooms on the board will make a duplicate of itself in the direction of the arrow on the mushroom.<br/><br/>Mushrooms that spawn towards each other will combine their directions allowing them to make copies of themselves in multiple directions. If a player's mushroom spawns towards his opponent's mushroom, it will attack and capture it, changing the colour to its own. However a capture can be prevented if the defending mushroom has a direction opposed to the attacking mushroom. After spawning the turn passes to the next player and so on.<br/><br/>The board is made up of grass squares which are worth 1 point as well as flower squares which are worth 3 points. A player earns the points on the square in which he has a mushroom. The game ends when there are no more empty squares on the board and the winner is the player with the most points.<br/><br/>Play online: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.popnspawn.com' rel='nofollow'>http://www.popnspawn.com</a><br/><br/>"}, "134007": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Adrian DeAngelis", "David McClure"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Black Hole", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "3", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1481411_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Adrian DeAngelis"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["The Game Crafter, LLC", "Gravitysoft Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1481411.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Educational"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Black Hole was invented some years ago as a result of the game designer's fascination with strange cosmic phenomena.<br/><br/>Black Hole is a strategy game, not hard to learn, but extremely hard to play well.

The game plays much like the pen and paper game boxes. Each turn the player draws one &quot;star&quot; token from the supplied cloth bag (Affectionately known as the &quot;nebula&quot; and places it into an empty region of &quot;space&quot; on the the board.<br/><br/>Once a certain threshold number of adjacent stars is reached the whole zone collapses into a black hole and the player who played the star captures all of the stars in the collapsed zone before playing another star. With more than two players the game becomes mind-bogglingly difficult to think more than one move ahead making the tactics almost impossible to work out.<br/><br/>The game ships with two play modes, a basic mode in which all stars score the same and a more complicated advanced game where players compete to not only capture the most stars but the highest scoring ones as well. The advanced game also introduces gravity charges that allow players to remove a black hole from the board if stuck.<br/><br/>All in all a great little time waster that will continue to be played for years to come.<br/><br/>"}, "134008": {"poll": [], "name": "BlazBlue: Continuum Shift Extend", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese PlayStation Vita (BBQ Mode) edition", "Japanese PlayStation Vita edition", "North American PlayStation 3 edition", "North American PlayStation Vita edition", "North American Xbox 360 edition"], "average": "7.5", "videogameseries": ["BlazBlue (Core Series)"], "videogametheme": ["Anime"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Arc System Works Co., Ltd."], "videogamefranchise": ["BlazBlue"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 3", "PlayStation Vita", "Xbox 360"], "usersrated": "3", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Aksys Games", "Arc System Works Co., Ltd."], "description": "BlazBlue: Continuum Shift Extend (originally titled BlazBlue: Continuum Shift II Plus) was announced for the PlayStation Vita at E3 2011, and was later confirmed to be slated for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as well.

Very little of it remains today. Only a few young trees still grow among the stumps of their tall and proud progenitors. With their hunger for wood the loggers broke an ancient contract though and now the once benevolent spirit living in the tree at the very top of the hill plots revenge as it stubbornly clings to existence.<br/><br/>Inhabitants of the nearby villages have set up a stone circle connected by sacred rope to contain the now malicious spirit, that manifests at night, together with a spectral image of its tree, but this is a temporary measure at best. With every night confined to the top of the hill, with every gust of wind rustling the ghostly leaves of its tree the spirit descends deeper into madness and its power grows. Only once the blood of those responsible for the death of its forest has been spilt at its feet will it be able to rest in peace.<br/><br/>"}, "134079": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1482933.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Sven Fallenius"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "3", "age": "8", "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1482933_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Fan Expansion", "Print & Play", "Trains", "Transportation", "Travel"], "description": "&Ouml;sterg&ouml;tland in the 1930's is an unofficial expansion to Alan R Moon&rsquo;s and Days of Wonder's Ticket to Ride series.

Menu design was updated, which took away the Test Drive 5-esque menus and revamped them with a more futuristic and industrial design. New car and track lists are welcomed by more colorful design and slightly improved albeit similar graphics.<br/><br/>The game includes four modes:<br/><br/>Single Race: Allows players to race any of their cars they purchased on any unlocked track. Each race has four opponents.<br/><br/>Tournament: Unlocks new tracks and cars; winning races here earns points that can be used to upgrade cars. The player must finish first in all three races to unlock another three tracks and a new tournament. Like Single Race, there are four opponents which stay consistent from race to race.<br/><br/>Cop Chase: Players can choose from any of four police vehicles and any of their unlocked track. Gameplay here is drastically different than other modes, and more complicated. Unlike other single player modes, there are only three opponents. The player has two minutes to give as many citations to the drivers as possible. The total is multiplied by five hundred and that is the amount of in-game currency given to the player.<br/><br/>Two Player: Two players can play together so long as the two systems are connected together.<br/><br/>In-game currency won in these modes can be spent on new cars.<br/>Tracks<br/><br/>There are 48 tracks in 12 locations. The locations are less specifically than console versions of previous Test Drive games and thus less resemble their real life counterparts. However, they appear to be much closer than its predecessor's tracks. They are also more realistic and colorful than the particularly bland colors used in Test Drive 6. Locations include Washington, D.C., Hollywood, Las Vegas, Germany, China, Sydney, and some others.<br/>Vehicles<br/><br/>There are thirteen licensed vehicles in the game. Most of these were adopted from Test Drive 5 and Test Drive 6.<br/><br/>One of the thirteen cars are available from the start, the Lotus Elise. Ten of these can be bought with in-game currency. These include the 1985 Ford Mustang LX 5.0, Dodge Charger Daytona, 1998 Ford Mustang GT, Plymouth Barracuda, Jaguar XKR, Panoz Roadster, Lotus Esprit, Saleen S351, Dodge Viper, and the Ford GT40. Two additional cars can be won, the Shelby Cobra and Jaguar XJ220.<br/><br/>All of the cars have a default color that cannot be changed. For example, the Charger is always red-orange, the Elise is always yellow, and so forth. Despite these colors showing up on the car selection menu, some of the cars' colors look drastically different during actual gameplay. An example would be the '98 Mustang, which appears to be a lime green color in the menus, but sports a dark green color while racing. Another would be the 'Cuda, which is a similar lime color in the menus but appears with a grey-like blue color in the game. Others, like the XKR and Elise, appear much closer in color to their menu counterparts.<br/><br/>Cars can, however, be upgraded with &quot;power ups&quot; that change top speed, acceleration and traction. Nitrous oxide can also be added to any vehicle. These modifications are available only after winning a race (and cannot be purchased any other way) with a number of points available based on the player's rank (first place gives five points to use, second gets two, and last gets none).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Test Drive 2001&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "134089": {"poll": [], "name": "Tech Deck Skateboarding", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Game Boy Color edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Sports - Skateboarding"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Handheld Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["Game Boy Color"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Activision"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A skateboarding game where you play as a &quot;finger&quot; person on the miniature finger boards called Tech Decks.

All that is truly known is that the player character, either a boy named Ken (Kou in Japan), or a girl named Mery (Nami in Japan) (the names are optional), has become stranded on a deserted island after a storm capsizes the player's boat, and must actively work to survive and possibly find a way to escape back to civilization. Interaction with other characters is scarce or entirely absent, depending on how the player chooses to progress throughout the game.<br/><br/>The 2D view is characteristic of most adventure games of its generation such as The Legend of Zelda. The player must keep track of hunger, thirst and fatigue meters in addition to the traditional Health Points, which require the accomplishment of &quot;every day&quot; tasks such as eating, drinking, and sleeping, as well as hunting, gathering, and finding a place to rest.<br/><br/>Another important aspect of the game is the item-crafting system. Many elements of the environment can be picked up and collected, although most objects serve no purpose in their original form. However, the game allows the player to combine two or three objects in order to form tools, weapons, and other items to assist in the player character's survival, known in-game as &quot;merging.&quot; For example, a vine and a flexible piece of tree can be combined to form a bow; a stick, bird feather and pointed rock can be combined to form arrows; and a flexible piece of tree can be combined with a discovered line of fishing gut to form a fishing rod.<br/><br/>Many of the items, such as kindling, arrows and torches, degrade over time and ultimately break, making the building of additional items unnecessary. Foods, such as meats, can go rotten in just an in-game day, but the player can merge cooked meats with flora identified as spices in order to preserve them; although there are about 15 set types of flora in the game, their effects when eaten change with every new game.<br/><br/>The game features a non-linear structure, giving the player the freedom to progress through the game without specific goals in mind beyond attaining the basic necessities of survival.<br/><br/>While the gameplay is free and unrestrained by any real plotline, there are a host of different endings dependent on discoveries the player makes, what objects the player has crafted, the current situation after a particular amount of time has elapsed, and so on.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Survival Kids&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "134092": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover Version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Lost Legion", "rpgdesigner": ["Tracey West"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3286891.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": ["Star Wars"], "average": "6", "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Space Opera)"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Decide Your Destiny"], "rpgpublisher": ["Grossett & Dunlap"], "rpgcategory": ["Solitaire Adventure"], "rpgseries": ["Decide Your Destiny: Star Wars - The Clone Wars"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3286891_t.jpg", "description": "From the Back of the Book:<br/><br/>Do you have what it takes to be a clone trooper in the Republic Army?

At first you&rsquo;ll be able to explore Yeld and safely return home. But eventually the door home will<br/>close, and you&rsquo;ll be trapped! Once you become trapped in Yeld you&rsquo;ll take Heroic Jobs and set out on an adventure to find hidden temples, defeat the Hunters of Yeld and win the magical keys to unlock the door back to the real world. You know how this works, right? It&rsquo;s like Final Fantasy + Alice in Wonderland, or The Legend of Zelda mashed up with Narnia.<br/><br/>Players take turns acting as the Game Master, creating adventures based on the other players input and ideas.

Each of the three types of playing piece have a particular pattern in which it can move. Feet can move around the cycles or back and forth along columns from cycle-to-cycle. Moons can move in spiral patterns between cycles, and suns can move in any of the directions. The pieces can behave in three different ways. These behaviours are: originating (sending an opponent's or one's own piece back to an origin space), consuming (removing an opponent's piece from play), and attracting (holding a foot in place).<br/><br/>Adomoc was originally invented in 2001 and has evolved such that there are two variants to the official rules.

A player's score is determined by comparing the solution of their expression to the number 20. For example: an expression with a solution of 18 would have a score of 2. Players must use tiles already on the board and those in their hand to form or add to expressions.<br/><br/>Although King of 20 is an effective educational tool, players of all ages and skill-sets can enjoy it.

He noticed that subjects such as English and History were regularly adapted into board game forms, while the subject of Math was poorly represented in the industry. The few math board games that existed were too simple or too complicated to play, or were made for an age range that was too specific.

This campaign game lets players recreate, in detail, the fighting of various great battles. Players take up the part of both the overall commanders, choosing which units will reinforce the initial troops, as well as the local commanders, fighting it out for each objective of the campaign. Players use a 'purchase' method to select troops for the first Scenario for the campaign. They set up their troops, determine who will attack and defend in that action then play that Scenario. The end of the Scenario brings the players to the Reorganization Phase, where they resolve the location of the front lines, determine the fate of disorganized and damaged units, and then purchase new units for the next Scenario.<br/><br/>PL 3.0 aims to provide a concise, enjoyable campaign experience, playable by the average gamer over a couple of evenings.

The original version was written at the University of Oklahoma by Robert Alan Koeneke and Jimmey Wayne Todd after they became hooked on Rogue but could not run it on the VAX-11/780 minicomputer to which they had access.<br/><br/>Version 1.0 was written in VMS Pascal and completed in the summer of 1983. From around 1985 the source code was widely distributed under a license that permitted sharing and modification but not commercial use. Koeneke's last release was Moria 4.7 in 1986 or 1987, although more recent versions have been compiled by a variety of authors.<br/><br/>Moria begins with creation of a character. The player first chooses a &quot;race&quot; from the following: Human, Half-Elf, Elf, Halfling, Gnome, Dwarf, Half-Orc, Half-Troll. Racial selection determines base statistics and class availability. One then selects the character's &quot;class&quot; from the following: Warrior, Mage, Priest, Rogue, Ranger, Paladin. Class further determines statistics, as well as the abilities acquired during gameplay. Mages, Rangers, and Rogues can learn magic; Priests and Paladins can learn prayers. Warriors possess no additional abilities.<br/><br/>The player begins the game with a limited number of items on a town level of six shops: a General Store, an Armory, a Weaponsmith, a Temple, an Alchemy shop, and a Magic-Users store. A staircase on this level descends into a series of randomly generated underground mazes. Deeper levels contain more powerful monsters and better treasures. Each time the player ascends or descends a staircase, a new level is created and the old one discarded; only the town persists throughout the game.<br/><br/>Moria inspired a number of derivative versions. Jim E. Wilson created Umoria, a modified version in C for UNIX and MS-DOS; Umoria later became Free Software under the GNU General Public License, through the work of the free-moria project. At the University of Washington a modified Pascal version named Imoria was developed, which has been ported to C by Steve Kertes.<br/><br/>Umoria (UNIX Moria), inspired the roguelike game Angband which influenced the preliminary design of Blizzard Entertainment's Diablo.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Moria (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "134261": {"boardgamedesigner": ["ADE, Consultores de Comunicaci\u00f3n, S.L.L."], "poll": [], "name": "TriviaNatura", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1487680_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Fundaci\u00f3n AndaNatura"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1487680.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Spanish First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Environmental", "Party Game", "Trivia"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "This is a roll-and-move spanish trivia game where players must answer only environmental questions at specific spaces to get progress toward victory, like in Trivial Pursuit.

The&nbsp;interface and controls are simple and intuitive, and there's no annoying micromanagement. Most of the game revolves around expanding&nbsp;your territory, using different units at the player's disposal. Each&nbsp;game can have up to 20 players spread around the entire map. To&nbsp;reward the players, we have Medals (achievements) and Strategy&nbsp;Points, which can be used to unlock various upgrades, and also&nbsp;translate into ranks.

Temporal Rifts have begun to appear, creating destructive links to the past and plunging the world into near-apocalyptic ruin. A few survivors, known only as Traversers, are able to harness the power of these Rifts.<br/><br/>In Krono, you play the role of a Traverser, travelling between the Rifts to assemble an army that lays claim to the greatest soldiers of the past, present, and future. Choose from samurai warriors, Viking berserkers, knights of Camelot, Aztec warriors, and more. Using this force, you will battle for survival and supremacy in this shattered future.<br/><br/>Directed at strategy card game players, Krono is an innovative combination of classic CCG action and deck-building games. Combine unit and command cards from your custom decks to compete for control of three different zones. Capture two zones and you win the game. The premise is simple, but the gameplay is deeply strategic.<br/><br/>Planned for iOS, Android and the web in 2013, Krono emerged from one of Large Animal's Sandbox Days, where our staff are free to experiment with new game ideas. The game proved so popular internally that we decided to share Krono with the world.<br/><br/>"}, "134309": {"rpgartist": ["Kat Hardy"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Parageology", "rpgdesigner": ["Adam Large"], "rpgproducer": ["Peter M.

Real nightmare. Fulfilment of all fears of the 50-ies of XX century. Here's what happened to the United States, when the alliance of aliens and communists launched a total nuclear war and then initiated the invasion. But the destruction is like gangrene lasting for years. United States - like tissue that is desperately struggling to survive, but inexorably losing the progressive necrosis. This struggle lasted for nearly 150 years, although there are still pockets of resistance, to combat and defeat the warped by dark matter communists and fighting for living space aliens from another dimension. Gehenna is everlasting. And you have to live right now - the Earth is a nuclear testing ground, flora and fauna seem to be decoration of a horror and humanity collapsed and degenerated to the tribal times. Can you influence the fate of the USA? Let's find out...<br/><br/>AFTERBOMB MADNESS is a post-apocalyptic, grotesque role-playing game in which players take the role of Americans, living during World War III. The primary objective of the game is to survive the horrific realities of this ruined world. However, to do this, players - aspiring daredevils strongly determined to work - will have to look for allies, and support various communities and organizations. Passivity is like a ghastly slippery slope - leads in a straight line to the fatal fall, dehumanization and grim acceptance of the euthanasia that is applied to America by aliens and communists.

This collection is made available for free and is not to be sold. Each individual game is a separate entity. is copyrighted separately (if at all), and is available for free. The author of each individual game is solely responsible for his or his work. No editing of individual games has been done.<br/> <br/>From the Introduction:<br/><br/>Searchers of the Unknown is a one-page roleplaying game where player characters are entirely defined by a minimalist old school Dungeons & Dragons one line tat block (e.g. &quot;AC 7, MV 9, HD 2, hp 9, #AT 1, D 1d8 mace&quot;) something like monster stat blocks in early editions of D&amp;D. All actions are based on those stats. Armor class is the old school &quot;lower is better,&quot; but the way armor class is used in SotU it makes sense with armor class generally helping against attacks but hindering initiative and attempts to be stealthy. The basic SotU generally uses a level plus AC roll under mechanic, using an opponent's AC when attacking or the character's own AC when trying to be stealthy. Saves require a roll under level plus 4. Variants versions of SotU use D20 or Target20 rolls. In the basic game, all characters are human adventurers. Supplements add demi-humans and spell-casting classes.<br/><br/>Like Microlite20, the original Searchers of the Unknown rules inspired a large number of similar games based on the same principles, ranging from simple variants like  N/A to modern day games, science fiction games, after the holocaust games, etc. Most of these games are complete in one or two pages. A few have additional supplements of their own.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there is no central web site for Searchers of the Unknown and links to the various versions one finds on the web are often broken. This Searchers of the Unknown RPG Collection was created to make it easier to obtain these excellent little RPGs.<br/><br/>"}, "134339": {"rpgartist": ["Sam Burley", "Paolo Puggioni", "Maichol Quinto", "Bryan Sola", "F\u0131rat Solhan"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder Roleplaying Game"], "poll": [], "name": "Dragonslayer's Handbook", "rpgdesigner": ["Shaun Hocking", "Marie Small", "Jerome Virnich"], "rpgproducer": ["Judy Bauer", "Logan Bonner", "Jason Bulmahn", "Christopher Carey", "John Compton", "Adam Daigle", "Crystal Frasier", "James Jacobs", "Jay Loomis", "Ryan Macklin", "Rob McCreary", "Erik Mona", "Mark Moreland", "Sonja Morris", "Stephen Radney-MacFarland", "Patrick Renie", "Sean K.

He could feel them as they stretched around him, connecting everything to everything else. So, when those lines drew him to a mysterious, glowing stone, he knew it was right and proper to take it with him. The stone allows him to twist the lines, rather than just perceive them, and he can now easily transmute objects into other materials.<br/><br/>John, The Scholar, mostly keeps to himself, though he&rsquo;s always willing to share a bit of wisdom and a bite to eat with anyone who passes by.

The game was programmed by Mark Lewis, and its graphic art was created by Jason Struck and Matthew McEwan.<br/><br/>Ancients is a standard fare dungeon crawl with a simplified Dungeons and Dragons element of character creation including Warrior, Priest, Mage, Rogue classes; Elf, Human, Dwarf races; and the rerollable statistics of Hitpoints, Dracos (Money), Intelligence, Strength, Constitution and Dexterity. Players control a party of four characters.<br/><br/>The world is a static grid based system with the top level being the relatively safe city of Locklaven including an Inn to recover hitpoints and mana and listen to rumors, an equipment shop to purchase gear, a casino to gamble, a church to heal and resurrect dead characters, and a guild to train characters. Beneath the city is a sewer system followed by a number of different levels corresponding to increasingly difficult monsters.<br/><br/>Combat is randomly triggered by walking through the dungeon and is turn based allowing the player characters to attack first. Combat choices include a Basic Melee or Ranged Attack, Defend, Flee and Magic. Player characters are effectively lined up in a square for combat with the left and right most characters lined up in back and the middle two characters in front, meaning in combat only the middle two characters can use melee attacks while the left and right most characters must attack from range or use magic.<br/><br/>Magic is broken down into the two primary classes of Priest and Mage. There are five accessible tiers of magic usage for each class and access to each tier is based upon character level. The first tier is available at level one. Access to tiers improves by one for each two levels gained, until the fifth tier is achieved.<br/><br/>Leveling occurs when characters receive enough experience from slaying monsters to reach the next level tier. Players must then travel back up to the city of Locklaven and visit the Guild.

During their trek, they encountered dreadful basilisks, scores of worgs, a terrible wurm, and many other dangerous creatures. The legends of the past have long been lost but tales have been handed down by mouth for generations. In Chesterwoode, the voyagers began to think they would never see light again, and indeed, Chesterwoode is said to be eternal. After many moons had passed and the expedition had lost most of its voyagers, they came upon a shiny black river.<br/><br/>They pondered how to ford the river for days until a wooden raft floated downstream and the watchman stopped it. The expedition crossed the river on the raft, and then let it float downstream. After a day's hiking, they came upon a lush valley where food grew in abundance. Soon they found a wooden sign pointing to the river. The sign read, &quot;The River Styx -- Those wno cross shall never return.&quot; After a survey of the area, the leaders discovered that they were on a tiny island surrounded by the River Styx. It became obvious that they could never ford tne river, so they began their civilization and founded small townships.<br/><br/>Cut off from perils by the world's most treacherous river, tne tiny island soon flourished. Food grew faster here than in any other place their civilization had ever been, and their numbers increased dramatically. The land was surveyed and divided into 63 provinces, each with six neighbors. (The provinces on the beach, however, had fewer than six neighbors.) As time progressed, the civilization became more and more prosperous.<br/><br/>And then the crops failed ... Massive food riots strained the government's power, and bands of robbers reaped havoc in the countryside.
