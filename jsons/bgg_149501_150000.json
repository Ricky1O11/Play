It removes everything non-essential, leaving behind a simple, fast-and-loose, easy-to-use system.<br/><br/>We believe that, not only is Third Edition the most popular gaming system on the planet, it&rsquo;s also one of the best. Its designers created a small, elegant set of core mechanics, resulting in an extremely flexible system. Then those core mechanics were used to implement a wide array of carefully researched and thoughtfully playtested guidelines and supplementary rules. The result is possibly the most robust and<br/>detailed system ever created.<br/><br/>Legends & Labyrinths, on the other hand, follows a simpler methodology: If it&rsquo;s not a core mechanic, it&rsquo;s not in the game.<br/><br/>The result is a slick, tight, elegant system that doesn&rsquo;t get bogged down in the details. Legends & Labyrinths jettisons the rules and guidelines which make Third Edition so robust, but it leaves behind the simple, flexible game which lies at the system&rsquo;s core.<br/><br/>from the designer's announcement:<br/>To pull something of a silver lining out of the 8-Bit Funding version of Legends & Labyrinths getting a final axe to the head (as painful as that remains for me): I am now free to share the Black Book Beta with all of you. (And I know there are many people who didn&rsquo;t have a chance to fund the project who have been begging me for months or years to get a peek at it.)<br/><br/>The Black Book Beta was designed to give funders a usable first peek at the rule system and it&rsquo;s exactly what the name says it is: A beta version of the rulebook. Most notably the volume is missing an index and the full versions of the Grimoire, the Treasury, and the Bestiary. Fortunately, the game is 100% compatible with 3rd Edition, so you can just use the spells, magic items, and monsters from the books you already own (or use the online SRD if all else fails); so the Black Book Beta remains a fully functional and fully playable game.<br/><br/>Because it&rsquo;s 100% compatible with 3rd Edition, you can use any supplement or adventure module for 3rd Edition in Legends &amp; Labyrinths without any conversion whatsoever (despite the fact that Legends &amp; Labyrinths is a massively streamlined and simplified version of the system).<br/><br/>The flip-side of 100% compatibility also means that you can rip out some of the awesome sub-systems of L&amp;L and use them directly in your 3rd Edition campaign. For example, you should check out the stunt system, the hazard creation system, and the monster creation system. (The last of these also makes it really, really easy to convert pre-3E material to L&amp;L or 3E.) Oh! There&rsquo;s also a streamlined, budget-based system for building encounters.<br/><br/>"}, "149525": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Pocket Mine", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"223059": "Android edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1816176.png", "videogametheme": {"2319": "Cartoon"}, "usersrated": "2", "average": "7.85", "videogamegenre": {"2723": "Endless Runner"}, "videogameplatform": {"6063": "Android"}, "videogamehonor": {"33153": "2013 CVA Best Indie Game of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1816176_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Pocket Mine is a mining game in which the player sprite digs through blocks that can contain ores, upgrades, and various forms of treasure.<br/><br/>As the character descends, more valuable items and powerups can be unearthed; however, reaching deeper depths requires the acquisition of a stronger pick - something that the miner must save up for.<br/><br/>For each mining session, the player is dealt 3 &quot;cards&quot; which dictate 3 bonuses that the play has for this round.

A ground war with the aliens seems inevitable as the first waves of enemies approach. Players take the role of weapons development companies seeking a contract with the Earth Defense Force.<br/><br/>Defeating aliens gets you brownie points, but sloppy work will let the next player sweep up the wounded remains. Balance subterfuge and self-promotion while blowing up aliens to claim ultimate victory!<br/><br/><br/>=========<br/><br/>The game is comprised of multiple player rounds over the course of three waves of invading aliens, with the starting player rotating between each. At the start of each round, cards can be played to give an advantage or disadvantage to yourself or other players for the duration of the round. Most player-to-player sabotage happens at this time, so players go into their turns aware of what odds might be stacked against them.<br/><br/>Once a round has begun, players each do the following as a complete turn:<br/><br/>- Receive energy tokens and event cards;<br/>- Commit energy tokens to their weapons;<br/>- Use event cards for their action, or as currency for upgrading weapons or hiring employees;<br/>- Fire charged weapons into a 3x3 grid of aliens.<br/><br/>Each weapon has its own targeting system and damage types, with stronger weapons needing more energy to fire. Each alien has their own Rock-Paper-Scissors style strengths and weaknesses against damage types.<br/><br/>Players keep alien corpses for end-game points, but can trade them for additional event cards on the Black Market. Weapon upgrades and employees also provide points at the end of the game, but on a handicap system - more points are awarded for weaker weapons or poor employees, awarding clever strategy over pure luck.<br/><br/>The game typically ends when the Wave III deck empties and the 3x3 grid can no longer be stocked, but there are a few conditions where all players lose if they can't coordinate their efforts well enough!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"223164": "First Edition"}, "age": "12", "name": "Alien Attack!", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2003": "Rock-Paper-Scissors"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"5679": "Aliens"}}, "149601": {"poll": {}, "name": "Alien Overlords", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "boardgameversion": {"223165": "English first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": {"1079": {"name": "Humor"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "In Alien Overlords, a sci-fi strategy game, players control fleets of starships and attempt to conquer or destroy the 24 planets on the game map. Players start with only one or two planets. Gobble up as many Neutral Planets as you can before enemy players' ships threaten your planets and Home World.<br/><br/>Before play begins, each player picks technologies and bonuses that influence their strategy for the game. The game features three classes of starships: Frigates, Cruisers and Battleships. Frigates are cheap to build, Cruisers move the fastest, and Battleships dish out the most damage. Planets are also of three sizes according to the resource value of that planet. Custom average dice are used for battles, allowing an element of chance while making it difficult to win or lose by luck alone.<br/><br/>Focusing on combat and strategic movement rather than resource management, Alien Overlords plays quickly. Technologies are chosen at the start of the game rather than researched during the game. If a ship is damaged it either explodes or repairs itself so that players do not have to keep track of damage. Over 50 unique, interesting, and sometimes funny Situation Cards give temporary bonuses or allow players to steal from, sabotage or destroy enemy forces.<br/><br/>Alien Overlords allows freedom of ship movement across the map rather than using &quot;space lanes.&quot; There is only one type of Resource to manage, an income based on the planets under a player's control. Number and locations of planets on the game map can be adjusted to suit the number of players, the desired game length, and for variety.<br/><br/>"}, "149603": {"statistics": {}, "name": "eXceed - Gun Bullet Children", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"223167": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "average": "4", "videogameseries": {"23804": "eXceed"}, "videogametheme": {"2278": "Anime"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2505": "Shoot 'em Up"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A vertical bullet hell shoot em up game.

Strategy, maths, probability and bluffing combine to make this a game unlike any other.<br/><br/>How to play<br/><br/>Each wizard holds nine spell cards numbered from one to nine. As our wizards are more &quot;Greedy&quot; than &quot;Gandalf&quot;, their spell-casting abilities leave a little to be desired -  making their spells a little on the unusual side. The game's incantations include things like summoning an &ldquo;absolutely massive chicken&rdquo; or &ldquo;a woman who shouts hurricanes.<br/><br/>Players take it in turns to secretly select and then lay three spell cards face down, either side of a duel token. This is repeated until each wizard has played all nine of the cards they hold. Duels are resolved by adding up the total value of cards - with the wizard with the highest winning that particular scrap. Win two duels out of three and a piece of cake becomes theirs.<br/><br/>However, three pieces of cake are needed to win the game - and because our Wizards are Greedy, they value cake over spells. Winning a piece of cake means discarding a spell card. And as the cake cards are double-sided, the opposing wizard can see exactly when they are being played. When cake is in play, the game becomes one of strategy, bluffing and probability - do you have what it takes to get your cake and eat it?<br/><br/>Beautifully illustrated, easy to learn yet full of decisions and intrigue, it&rsquo;s a game which can be enjoyed by any level of player.

Each character has a full stat block, including campaign traits, a detailed background and personality, and advice on advancement through 4th level. Find one that suits you and you&rsquo;re ready to play. These characters have been built using a 20-point buy, as many Pathfinder players and GMs prefer it. However, each comes with instructions on how to adjust the stats to a 15-point buy, should your GM wish to use the standard for Paizo&rsquo;s adventure paths. If your group enjoys an epic fantasy feel for their characters, then adjustments up to a 25-point buy are also available. Whatever your style of play, just a few minor tweaks will have you ready to go.<br/><br/>The iconic consist of seven unique races from the Obsidian Apocalypse campaign setting such as:<br/><br/>     Exalted: The exalted are the direct offspring of angelic outsiders mated with the humans of Abaddon. The unique circumstances of Abaddon make this pairing a more common event than it might be in other parts of the multiverse. The angels here are thrust into closer contact with mortals than they are used to, cut off from the gods and entities that they serve and forced to make new lives for themselves.<br/>     Genesai: Genesai are the result of demonic outsiders mating with angelic outsiders, defying all that both sides of the eternal conflict between good and evil consider inviolate. In other worlds and planes of existence, this pairing might be all but unthinkable, but the nature of Abaddon as a &ldquo;planar trap&rdquo; throws these opposites together far more often than elsewhere. Whatever the agents of good and evil have against reach other, as outsiders they at least share the same origin.<br/>     Harrowed: The harrowed are one of the most despised and feared races of Abaddon. They are no less than the result of the unholy and abominable union between mortal humanoids and the foul undead. To the subjugated populace, the very existence of the harrowed is a constant reminder of their undead overlords who have taken over Abaddon. These creatures are royal bastards, neither fully mortal nor fully undead, caught between the two worlds.<br/>     Infernals: Infernals are the offspring of demonic outsiders and humanity upon Abaddon or the result of a tainted bloodline throwing up a child bearing the mark of past transgressions of natural law. Infernals are relatively common on Abaddon, given the nature of the world as a &ldquo;planar trap&rdquo; and the natural proclivities of the demons who find themselves here, as they are trapped, frustrated, and have only a few playthings to assuage their boredom.<br/>     Khymer: The khymer are descendants of those killed, or at least physically destroyed, by the meteor that struck Abaddon. The necromantic radiation emanating from the blast had many long-lasting effects on Abaddon and its people. For the inhabitants of one city, though, it meant liquefaction followed by mingling with the ravening light. This process infused the liquid remains with negative energy, which coupled with the latent remnants of that people&rsquo;s native psionic abilities.<br/>     Lykian: Abaddon&rsquo;s werewolf lycanthropes, most commonly called lykians, are one of the most unusual residents of the world. Unlike standard lycanthropes, lykians are born as lycanthropes. They do not suffer from the lycanthropic disease; instead, they are considered a separate humanoid race with the shapechanger subtype. Before the apocalypse, many carried the curse of lycanthropy, but due to unknown, powerful forces of magic, the curse took on a new form from which the lykians have evolved directly. Lykians, unlike lycanthropes, have only one physical form, despite their shapechanger subtype. They are considered by many to be extremely bestial, hostile, and brutish, like their canine lineage. Their primal nature often usurps and controls their cognitive and reasoning abilities.<br/>     Osirian: According to ancient lore, the osirians were the first intelligent species to emerge on Abaddon, chosen by the gods to be their first creation on this world. They were, and are, a regal and proficient people famed for their skill with their hands and their swiftness, as dangerous archers and fencers and makers of technical wonders and fine crafts.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>These iconic consist of:<br/><br/>     Ilita Faara, Female khymer psychic warrior<br/>     Mik&rsquo;quol an-str-natk, Male osirian cleric (Zebediah)<br/>     Mouse, Female genesai rogue<br/>     Setiphet Sir Lykash, Female harrowed fighter<br/>     (Treeshearer) Snarltooth Swifttongue, Female lykian ranger<br/>     Xasturian, Male infernal sorcerer<br/>     Yeremil Al Zebediah, Male exalted monk<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "149656": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1809539.png", "is_expanded_by": {"172209": {"name": "Zombie Apocalypse Geocaching: Exclusive Kickstarter Pack"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"68626": {"name": "Dan Hundycz"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"68656": "Courtney Boulton"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"25210": {"name": "DPH Games Inc"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1809539_t.png", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "description": "The Zombie Apocalypse has begun!<br/><br/>Fortunately, YOU have your priorities straight.

Separating the two, an &ldquo;Iron Curtain&rdquo; formed of high walls and minefields as well as hundreds of thousands of well armed troops.

Some others missions target robots factories which slow down a little their productions.<br/><br/>During each mission you control only one of your 4 Exos at a time, you can change which one you control depending on the tactical situation. The game is played in turn on a square tiles. Each turn you can do one action, Move, Attack, Change Exos, Hacking,Special...then all activated robots take one action each.<br/><br/>The gameplay is very tactical and sometimes almost puzzle like, as there is no luck in combat. There are a number of hazards on the ground, both helpful and harmful. And you can identify enemy robots from a distance depending on your sensors. Then it is a matter of finding the best course of actions to avoid attacks and possible chain reactions and to hack the locked door to find loots.<br/><br/>"}, "149715": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Haymaker!

As the German forces began the push the partisans were ready and awaiting for an ambush. The Partisans were not trained soldiers and the tactics of the partisans were simple and the challenges put on them by their leaders were less than would be expected from a military unit. Surprise and ambush were their best tactic. Their spot chosen lay on both sides of the Narotch stream. Having capturing a German field gun earlier and using their long hidden anti tank gun&mdash;a leftover from the retreating Russians in 1941&mdash;the ambush was prepared. Mines were placed, demolition charges were planted by explosive teams smuggled behind German lines and now the wait began. One Partisan survivor remembered: &ldquo;We would ambush the Germans on the Narotch stream bank. We knew the Germans planned to come to the aid of the guard from the other side of the stream. Our commander, Sagalchik, was also a guide, as he had lived in Miadel for many years and was familiar with the area. When we arrived everything was quiet. Suddenly shots were heard. We lay down and awaited the Germans. When we received the sign to attack we ran to the houses where the Germans and Lithuanian sharpshooters were. The battle lasted a few hours and the Germans dispersed.&rdquo; Within an hour the fight was over leaving the battlefield in partisans hands. The Germans suffered 40 dead and over 50 wounded. &ldquo;Lenz-Sud&rsquo; was off to a bloody start.<br/><br/>Bandenkrieg: Hell Behind the Eastern Front is a historical module depicting combat that occurred during an anti-partisan operation, Operation Lenz Nord, near Borisov in Byelorussia in April 1943.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"223468": "First edition"}, "name": "ASL Comp Bandenkrieg: Hell Behind the Eastern Front", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "average": "5.33333", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "3", "expands": {"243": {"name": "Advanced Squad Leader"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"62": "Advanced Squad Leader"}}, "149717": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1820422.png", "poll": {}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamecompilation": {"29690": "Finland at War, v.

This expandable board game features fast paced, full contact racing set on the desert world of Terra Nova. Race around the track, burn rubber to pull ahead, jump over terrain, shoot your opponent if he gets a bit to far ahead, take a swipe at him with your vibro blade or push him in the wall. All this along with spin-outs, skids and rattled pilots bring the exciting world of Gear Rally racing to your table top. Includes a new fast and easy to learn ruleset with lots of rule and game play examples.<br/><br/>Badlands Rally uses D6 dice to resolve both opposed and unopposed actions. Each model, called a Gear, has a number of Attributes that distinguish its own special characteristics and advantages in the game. Players must choose what combination of attack, special movement or other actions will lead them to victory. Dice mechanics allow for quick resolution of these actions through simple rolls of varying numbers of dice depending on the modifiers that apply. All modifiers either add dice to a roll or subtract them. There are two kinds of roll: A Roll and a Check.  A Roll is an unopposed test which uses a simple comparison of dice to an Attribute for a number of successes.  A Check is an opposed test between players that uses the high dice in a roll and adds a bonus based on the other dice compared to an Attribute. In each lap of a game a Gear may resolve between four and six actions depending on player choices. A standard match is 2-3 laps.  Variable Gear upgrades, Gear choices, and Scenarios allow for an almost infinite variety of game conditions. Additional Gear data cards are provided that allow player to use almost the entire Heavy Gear line of miniatures from Dream Pod 9 to add even more variety to their games. Up to Eight Gears can race at once with two to four players being the norm.<br/> The box set includes rules booklet, full color hex map, 4 easy to assemble racing gear miniatures of the Rally Viper, Rally Pitbull, Rally Jerboa and Rally Ferret cast in pewter with plastic hex bases, 8 double-sided datacards (Rally Viper/Viper II, Rally Pitbull/Pitbull II, Rally Jerboa/Jerboa II, Rally Ferret/Ferret II, Rally Grizzly/Mamba, Rally Cobra/Chasseur MkII, Rally Sapeur/Iguana, and Rally Hunter/Dart Jager), assorted counters (rattled tracker gears, rattled, rally, damage, and upgrades) , 2 double-sided quick reference cards (rules and weapons/upgrades), and 6 dice. The double-sided Rally Grizzly/Mamba, Rally Cobra/Chasseur MkII, Rally Sapeur/Iguana, and Rally Hunter/Dart Jager datacards can also be used to proxy in other similar size gears from the Heavy Gear Blitz and Arena miniature lines.<br/><br/>"}, "149775": {"rpgitemversion": {"223573": "First English Printing"}, "rpgseries": {"3562": "Monsternomicon"}, "name": "Monsternomicon: Volume 1: Denizens of the Iron Kingdoms V3.5", "rpgproducer": {"20425": "Bryan Cutler"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2011287.png", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": {"885": "Iron Kingdoms"}, "average": "7", "rpgissuearticle": {"146086": "Monsternomicon & Beyond"}, "rpg": {"524": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"}, "poll": {}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2011287_t.png", "description": "[From back cover]<br/><br/>&quot;For generations men have feared the shadows of our realm, told tales of things that go bump in the dark, and cowered behind locked doors through the cold, lonely hours of night.

This is their story.<br/><br/>Fireteam Zero is a cooperative game for up to four players who must cut a path through an endless swarm of deadly monsters in order to discover and defeat the ultimate evil behind them. Each player possesses a set of brutal combat skills that are represented by a deck of cards unique to that character. Play cards to devastate the creatures in your way, help your teammates survive the onslaught, or even reshape the tactical landscape with the proper application of explosive ordinance. The battle is fought across three maps of increasing difficulty, each one bringing more and tougher enemies than the last. Players must search for and complete mission objectives in order to progress and bring them one step closer to the final showdown.<br/><br/>Aiding them are two NPC Specialists, one with an uncanny ability to sense the location and nature of the supernatural energy in the area and another with an encyclopedic knowledge of the arcane. Use the Specialists wisely or risk failure no matter how many monsters you defeat.<br/><br/>Race against time as the creatures on the board become stronger and more cunning. The longer you take to complete your objectives, the more Monster Twist cards are revealed, each granting a new and terrible aspect to your enemy. In each set of missions you will face a different family of horrifying creatures, each with their own special abilities and twist cards.<br/><br/>Players must not only fight for their lives, but at the same time they must make smart tactical choices with their teammates in order to make the best use of a limited resource, the cards in their hands.

Two full battles are included:<br/> Cedar Mountain<br/>August 9th, 1862.  With the Peninsular Campaign winding down, Gen. Robert E. Lee sent Maj. Gens. Stonewall Jackson and A.P. Hill to attack Maj. Gen. John Pope&rsquo;s new Federal Army of Virginia  with 27,000 troops.<br/><br/>Gen. John Pope, hoping to draw attention away from Maj. Gen. George McClellan&rsquo;s withdrawal from the Peninsula, moved against the rail junction at Gordonsville, Va.   Stonewall Jackson found USA Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Banks&rsquo;s division isolated.  Jackson crossed the Rapidan River to engage.  Pope ordered Brig. Gen. James Ricketts&rsquo;s division to unite with Banks&rsquo;s forces on high ground near Cedar Run, seven miles south of the town of Culpeper.  These two forces met in the afternoon heat.<br/> South Mountain<br/>September 14th, 1862.  After the CSA success at Second Bull Run Gen. Robert E. Lee believed the demoralized USA armies could not respond to any bold action.  Thusly, he planned a campaign to raid Maryland and Pennsylvania and to threaten Washington D.C. itself.  Once again Lee confidently divided his army to both move north and neutralize the large Union garrison at Harper&rsquo;s Ferry.<br/><br/>However, the Union Army under Gen. George B. McClellan was quick to recover from the Bull Run defeat and was already in pursuit of Lee.  The gods of war smiled on the Union troops as a copy of Lee&rsquo;s orders fell into Union hands.  An attack through the lightly held gaps at South Mountain would cut Lee&rsquo;s army in two and perhaps end the war.  At 6:00 am the Union Army moved.<br/><br/>The Great Battles of the American Civil War Series:<br/>This series is one of the hobby&rsquo;s longest lived design concepts, springing from the legendary regimental level Gettysburg game -Terrible Swift Sword (SPI)- designed by Richard Berg in 1976.  Under GMT, the rules system has remained stable but has shown remarkable flexibility to allow each game to smoothly incorporate additional rules to reflect the historical battles.  The series relies on interactive chit-pull mechanics to simulate the oftentimes chaotic nature of the 19th Century battlefield at the regimental level. <br/><br/><br/>The Game:<br/>Twin Peaks contains two battle games each with its own full size map on one double-sided mapsheet. Experienced players will be able to play either in one sitting.  Both battles highlight the effects of fatigue from the late summer heat and the difficult terrain.  The optional fatigue rules are mandatory in both battles.

Raicer&rsquo;s popular and critically acclaimed Clash of Giants WWI series to two of the storied battles of the American Civil War: Second Bull Run and Gettysburg. CoG: Civil War uses a modified version of the chit-pull Activation system of Clash of Giants II: Campaigns of Galicia and First Ypres, 1914, while retaining the CoG combat system. Every (mostly brigade-level) unit has a Tactical Efficiency Rating based on its morale, training, leadership, and experience, but even a poor unit can have a heroic moment, while the Iron Brigade might not always be made of iron. It is a true player&rsquo;s system, which produces realistic results without a lot of fiddly procedures, and allows players to concentrate on the game rather than the rules.<br/> Units in CoG: Civil War are mostly infantry brigades, (with the odd cavalry brigade or demi-brigade).  Each day is divided into four day turns and one night turn. The maps depict woods, hills, steep hexsides, railway cuts and embankments, roads, rivers, creeks, bridges, towns, marshy ground, and the Devil&rsquo;s Den at Gettysburg.<br/> The Activation rules, which combines random formation activation (mostly corps for the Union and divisions for the Confederates) with variable movement allowances, creates the fog of war and friction so important to Civil War battles. Ordering your corps commander to take a hill is one thing-getting him to act as you wish is another. And because these effects are achieved without hidden counter/dummy unit mechanics, CoG: Civil War is not only a fast-paced two-player game, but excellent as well for solo play.  Some Activation markers also allow you to coordinate more than one formation, such as Longstreet at Gettysburg. But don&rsquo;t expect Old Pete to do so early in the day!<br/><br/>One thing that speeds play in CoG: Civil War is the unusual treatment of artillery. There are no artillery units depicted; instead artillery appears as Combat Support Markers which are added (attacker first) to the combat strength of engaged units. Artillery CSMs are generally assigned to a specific division or corps, though army reserve artillery can be used to support any units. Artillery cannot be used in combat in certain terrain (woods or town hexes), but there are no line of sight considerations to slow down play or complicate the rules. Instead both line of sight and enemy counter-battery fire are handled with an elegant abstraction: each turn all available artillery CSMs of both sides go into a cup, and then half are randomly drawn. Whatever comes out of the cup is available for use that turn, so the player with more artillery on the field is more likely to get artillery support. This also allows a simple way to model the effectiveness of the Union Artillery Reserve at Gettysburg; once arrived, these markers never go in the cup, and are always available for use. Overall, CoG: Civil War&rsquo;s portrait of artillery as an occasionally decisive but definitely secondary arm is arguabley more realistic than many more complicated designs.<br/> The two battles, Second Bull Run and Gettysburg, depict one of Lee&rsquo;s greatest victories, prior to his first invasion of the north, and his greatest defeat during his second invasion. Both are meeting engagements, with limited forces deployed at the start, gradually building to mighty clashes. The arrival of fresh forces is another area where the game system allows variability: units may be delayed or arrive at the wrong road. You can even attempt to speed the arrival of your off-board forces, but at increased risk of their arriving later instead.<br/><br/><br/>Winning involves a combination of taking and holding victory hexes, exiting units, and inflicting casualties. You can also earn victory points to compensate for units whose arrival is delayed-but only if you didn&rsquo;t try to force march them to an earlier arrival!  Players will have to judge trading losses for taking or holding tactically important ground.<br/><br/><br/>Special rules cover such things as General Pope&rsquo;s confused and confusing orders at Second Bull Run, the Confederate grand battery on the third day at Gettysburg, the use of the Union VI Corps as a reserve in both battles, cavalry delaying actions and retreat before combat, rallying units at night, and the actions of certain key leaders. But though there is enough chrome to give each battle a distinctive flavor, the action remains uncluttered, quick-playing, and  exciting.<br/> Not simply &ldquo;another Civil War battle system,&rdquo; CoG: Civil War presents a fresh new look at an oft-game topic. Giving each side a chance to change history in an afternoon&rsquo;s gaming, the use of the Clash of Giants system also shows the sometimes surprising links between the battles of the Civil War and the opening battles of the Great War 50 years later.

The buildings on the game ground are available for common use, using them for your purpose might have unintended consequences by profiting others. In some cases, other players can benefit even more from the buildings you made than yourself! The players have to work around this dilemma by developing their own strategy.<br/><br/>In Guild Stack players players start with 3 lands. Every turn you add a building to one of these lands. In a turn you can also acquire an occupation if one of your lands has no occupation on it and the required buildings are present. These occupations are mostly triggered by the building of certain buildings. You can do this yourself or react to your opponents. When triggered you can (among others) get points or more lands. There are also options to sabotage the buildings of other players. Combined with the triggering of the buildings this gives a lot of interaction in the game.<br/><br/>The game can end in 3 ways. The most common is for one of the players the reach the necessary score. What this score is depends on the number of players. The game also ends when three types of buildings run out or a player cannot place a building any more (because his lands are full).<br/><br/>"}, "149815": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Pyramid (Volume 3, Issue 59 - Sep 2013)", "rpgproducer": {"22": "Steve Jackson (I)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1843711.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"2109": "Pyramid"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"110815": "Conspiracy in Action!"}, "rpg": {"332": "GURPS (4th Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"223636": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1843711_t.png", "description": "Conspiracies<br/><br/>Uncover the Truth . . . or Work to Conceal It!<br/><br/>The shadows are known for their secrets.

It's inspired by the hit show 24 and the movie Nick Of Time, and if it's done right, players will feel all the same pulse-pounding tension and excitement.  You can use it for modern action/adventure (and that's probably where you'll want to start, due to its familiarity), but you can use it for any genre and style, from science fiction to two-fisted pulp to Western to mythic high fantasy -- as long as you have a story that hinges on every tick of the clock.<br/><br/>RealTime is a simple, rules-light game.  That's because, when you're playing RealTime, you won't have time to think much about rules.  In fact, the rules aren't the most important part of RealTime.  Far more important are the tips, tricks, and techniques for making the real time element work -- ways to make your character's down-time (e.g., driving across town) fit in with other characters' up-time, to keep track of time spend doing different things, etc.  If you want to play it, it's imperative that all the players be familiar with these techniques before the game, because there won't be time to think much about them during the game.<br/><br/>from Dice, or Not:<br/>RealTime can be played either with dice or diceless. All mechanical game elements will be done by comparing a character's skill against a target value; without dice, it's a simple comparison, so you either can or can't do what you're attempting. If you prefer an element of randomness (I do), you'll add in the roll of one or two FUDGE dice (depending on the kind of action).<br/><br/>user comment:<br/>A stopwatch for the GM, and preferably one for each player as well, is part of the game equipment list.<br/><br/>The mechanics include a method for players to buy control of the narrative using points.<br/><br/>This game's mechanics are similar to Sapphire,a more recent game by Frank J.

Each player starts the game (sitting across the board from one another facing a long side of the board) with 12 stones placed in the nearest row, 10 identical pieces starting one each on all spaces except the two corners each of which is occupied by an activator.

Draws are not possible.<br/><br/>What's notable here is the use of two activator pieces based on an a notion created by designer Joe Joyce, as per the contest mentioned above.

Bishop<br/><br/>Prince Hubert Charming, son of the Baron of Westlake, and heir to Westlake Manor, is well known as a cold man, whose watery blue eyes seem to betray no emotion at all. Yet he is a great lover of beauty, as all his wives have proven. The first he found working in the cinders of a woodsman&rsquo;s cottage. Some say that the girl&rsquo;s jealous stepsisters threw her down a well to prevent her from becoming the young prince&rsquo;s bride, but even death did not bar Prince Charming, and she enchanted everyone at the wedding. Her stepsisters were placed in spiked barrels filled with hot coals and dragged through the town until they themselves died.<br/><br/>Whatever process Prince Charming used to revive his bride, it did not last forever. All too soon, the Princess Ella took ill and died.<br/><br/>Charming then found another bride, and there was no doubt in this case that she was dead. She was entombed in a glass coffin guarded by half a dozen or so dwarves. Yet,<br/>when Prince Charming injected his magic elixir and kissed her upon the lips, her eyelids fluttered open and she breathed again! The story was told that the new Princess had been in but a deep coma, a sham of death, until a poisoned apple was dislodged by the Prince&rsquo;s kiss. But folk began to whisper in dread, and none were surprised when it was announced that Princess Snow, like Princess Ella, succumbed to a fatal illness after only a few years of marital bliss.<br/><br/>In all kingdoms there are tales, and in the Barony of Westlake, it is said that the Grimmswood hides the ruins of a long-lost realm. The daughter of its final king, cursed by a malevolent faerie, pricked her finger on a spindle upon her sixteenth birthday, in the blossom of her youth, and died. With her death, the kingdom went to ruin. Few now dare to go far into the Grimmswood, although the riches of the lost kingdom are said to lie unclaimed within. Fear of dark fey magic and even greater evils keep men out.<br/><br/>Or they did so until now. For Prince Hubert Charming of Westlake has determined that the long-dead Princess Beauty is only cursed to sleep away the aeons, and he will have her for his bride. His men rounded up a stable of &ldquo;volunteers&rdquo; at the beginning of one early autumn morning, and here you are, with what makeshift arms and equipment you had upon you when you were &ldquo;volunteered&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Your mission, the Prince&rsquo;s Bailiff explains, is to enter the ruined castle, find the place where the &ldquo;Sleeping&rdquo; Beauty lies, and bring her forth for Prince Charming to restore with a kiss. Those who choose not to go upon this quest must take their chances with the Prince&rsquo;s Guard, twenty men strong, and be declared outlaw. Those who choose to hazard their lives within the ruined castle may keep what they find, apart from the sleeping princess, but dare not leave without her.<br/><br/><br/>How Did We Get Here<br/><br/>This product comes about due to the confluence of several factors.<br/><br/>First, I had planned to do a series of fairy tale-based adventures for the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG, titled Faerie Tales from Unlit Shores. The idea was to combine classic fairy tales with one or more strong Appendix N influences, to create something that accentuated the folkloric (and often dark) fey elements of the original tale and the adventurous energy of Appendix N fiction.<br/><br/>Second, my good friend Raechel Henderson, who was the first person to ever pay me for a piece of writing, had a Kickstarter project that was moving slowly. I asked my readers to help spread the word about Raechel&rsquo;s project, in return for which I would write a free adventure. The adventure you are now reading is that free adventure. Her project, Spellbound and Spindles, is related to fairy tales too, making this a perfect tribute to those who contributed either with dollars or links.<br/><br/>Finally, Mark Gedak of Purple Duck Games not only agreed to publish the follow up series of fairy tale-based adventures, but also to publish the free adventure  professionally. You will be seeing at least five more adventure in this series, creating a full arc from 0-level to level 5. If they are popular, I (or others working with Purple Duck Games) might do more.<br/><br/>I hope you like them.<br/><br/>"}, "149873": {"rpgitemversion": {"223735": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Seven Deadly Skills of Sir Amoral the Misbegotten", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1815227.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgproducer": {"61713": "Perry Fehr"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"10737": "Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game"}, "average": "0", "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"23800": "Campaign Elements"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1815227_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>In years long past, Gryffon Keep was a border fortification guarding a somewhat well-used roadway.

Though no play is performed here, there is art, of a sort. Each of the stones bears several images, three, in fact, two of which are the same on every stone, and one different. The similar images bookend the different on each stone, and appear as the engraving of a tall, thin humanoid with pointed ears, and a muscular humanoid with tusk-like fangs and fierce demeanor. It is said that if you look at the images long enough, in that wind-swept place, they start to look more and more like each other. The central image of each stone is unique.

The sense of ominous antiquity of long-past decadence fills the room. The walls bleed drapes of crimson velvet, and a thick sanguine marble carpet covers the wooden floor. In the corner sits an old celesta that a musician plays to spine-chilling effect. In the center in the room is an ornate candle chandelier, above a circle of majestic chairs. It is in this dark ring of seats that stories of unremitting terror pours from the lips of people who revel in its taste, and are held spellbound in its sound.<br/><br/>As with all things in life, the small group fades away, like the setting sun, and the room is left abandoned. Dust settles on the surfaces, the drapes become moth-eaten tatters, and the shimmering crystal chandelier dulles to a gossamer of latticed cobwebs. Now the room is but an empty shell of the old nightmares told long ago, lingering for the unwary to one day hear again&hellip;in the Red Room.<br/><br/>From the brilliant minds of John A.
