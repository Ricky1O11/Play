Fairly rare to find a package that isn't opened.<br/><br/>From the Rules Card:<br/><br/>Welcome to Havic! You are a student battling others in a strange, mysterious world. You and your opponent each have 21 points of sanity. Once a player's sanity has been reduced to zero, he loses.<br/><br/>To reduce your opponent's sanity, you will need to recruit peons, create effects, and use articles in any way possible to destroy your opponent before he destroys you. Your deck is your weapon against your worthy foe. It must contain exactly sixty cards.<br/><br/>After thoroughly shuffling your deck, each player draws eight cards from the top of the deck. A die is rolled. The player who rolls the highest number goes first.<br/><br/>When it is your turn, a player first drops a property card. When whacked, or turned sideways, this card, if this card is a brewery yields one unit of alcohol: a convenience store yields one unit of cigarettes. You can now use this unit to recruit peons, create effects, and articles as you see fit.<br/><br/>Each Peon, article, and effect has a creation cost. It is denoted on the top right hand corner of the card. For each beer bottle, or cigarette shown on a card, one and of the same type must be whacked.<br/><br/>In the case of peons, the first number in the bottom right hand corner denotes the amount of damage this peon can do to your opponent, or other peons. The second number denotes the amount of damage that it will take to send this peon to the hospital.<br/><br/>When a peon first comes into play, he is hung over and can't attack, but he can block if he is not whacked. Your peons can attack only on your turn, and only if it is not hung over or whacked. To attack, you must first announce the attack phase, and then whack the peons that are attacking. The opponent then decides which of your peons his peons will block, or he can opt to take the damage himself, reducing his sanity (though only a peon with stealth can block another peon with stealth).<br/><br/>Unlike a peon, once an effect is cast, it goes directly to the hospital. An article also does not work during the turn it comes into play. and like a peon, it must be whacked to have it's effect. Once you are done attacking, it is your opponent's turn. At the beginning of your next turn, all whacked cards, unless otherwise specified, become unwhacked.

It is nominally a two-player game but can handle more players quite readily.<br/><br/>In the game, each player is a SPONGE Historian, helping out on an investigation.  The Historian position at SPONGE is often a short-lived one, and the &quot;Inactive Files&quot; are full of past Historians that didn&rsquo;t make it.  The object of the game is to last longer than any of your fellow Historians.<br/><br/>Each player also represents the forces of Evil that threaten to thwart SPONGE at every turn.  This means that you will be playing cards on your opponents as often as you play them on yourself.<br/><br/>Every Historian has his or her own deck of cards, comprised of seven categories: Locations (where your investigation takes you), Characters (people you encounter), Items (stuff you find), Weapons (stuff you find that will kill Beasts), Beasts (an assortment of creatures bent on killing you), Tomes (knowledge man was not meant to know) and Events (things that just happen to happen).<br/><br/>Each turn you normally get two Action Points.

Basically, any action that would put you into one of the Inactive Files (Known Dead, Presumed Dead, Asylum, Missing, Resigned, Inaccessible or Other) also puts you out of the game.

There are 8 of each in each of five different colors, for a total of 80 cards, which both players share as a common draw deck.<br/><br/>The game starts with the landscapes face down, randomly assigned knights or enchantresses on each player's side of the landscape cards, and five knights/enchantresses in each players hand. In the course of the game, if you play knights on your side of the territory and you have at least as many cards on your side before playing the card, you have the option of declaring an attack with that knight. The other player has a chance to respond by defending with a knight of exactly the same color (in which case both knights are left in place). If the attacker is successful, the loser loses all of their cards from their side, and the winner loses an equal number. Then, the winner must lose an additional number of cards from their side or the hand equal to the total number of knights on both sides that were involved in the conflict. Finally, the region is turned face up with the crowns on the bottom facing toward the controlling player. You can only attack up to two landscapes per turn, but you may play as many cards as you would like to on your turn. The max hand size at the end of a round is 5. The object is to control 15 crowns at the end of your turn (number of crowns on a card ranges from 1-3).<br/><br/>Two landscape cards have special abilities - Avalon reduces your loss from battles by one once per turn, and the forest with a standing stone allows you to declare an attack on your opponent with an enchantress as if she was a knight.<br/><br/>Enchantresses normally will convert enemy knights from their side of the board to yours unless countered with a same color enchantress. The countering player receives the aggressor's attacking enchantress into his hand if he counters an enchantress.<br/><br/>When the player is done playing cards, he draws one of the 5 Light tiles or 4 Dark tiles that describe the options for replenishing cards in hand.

Each game and module in the series will add maps, units, and all the personalities that will enable you to play, in some, but not daunting, detail your favorite periods.<br/><br/>Volume I, Rise of the Roman Republic, is the introductory game to the Ancient World series with shorter, smaller scenarios. Rise of the Roman Republic includes scenarios for the Samnite Wars (which also includes a three-player version that takes in the invasion of Alexander of Epirus), the invasion of Pyrrhus (including his Sicilian adventures), and also the first three years of Hannibal, all on a single map of Italy, complete with dated road system.<br/><br/>The focal point of the game system is the unusual set of mechanics that, in essence, have no allowance limits to movement. Units - troops under a leader - are free to move as far and as long as they want, subject to two major factors: leader capability to do so, as well as attrition.<br/><br/>The Romans are really fun, mostly because you have to master the Roman political system, from yearly elections, to pro-roguing consuls, even to asking the Senate permission to do many things, all of which serve to make running the Roman armies about as close to realistic as has ever been seen in a wargame.<br/><br/>The land combat system uses a unique Combat Results Table that includes the dreaded Unusual Result dicerolls, which replicate the battles that took place wherein the outcome belied the odds. But you still get the Carthaginian cavalry, the Epirote hoplites, elephants, and all the usual goodies you'd expect in such a game.<br/>The Ancient World is aimed at aficionados of the subject, as well as those interested in the breadth and depth of campaign operations.

Countless swarms of Red infantry, tanks, and guns then swept the lines. In four days, the pincers met near Kalach-um-Don &ndash; entombing the 6th Army in Stalingrad. During the next three months, the Germans will reel from successive Soviet hammer blows, try in vain to relieve the 6th Army, and fail to supply it from the air. The 6th Army surrenders, and only the counter-attack by von Manstein&rsquo;s panzers stop the red tide. The turning point of World War II in Europe has passed.<br/><br/>Enemy at the Gates, the second Operational Combat Series release by The Gamers, offers players different challenges from those in the very popular game Guderian&rsquo;s Blitzkrieg. The Soviet army has rearmed and reorganized their Tank Corps &ndash; their challenge to the Panzer Divisions. The unique force structures of each side force players to fight differently in order to maximize their strengths. And, of course, players must face the toughest operation and strategic choices they have ever faced. When to stand, when to run&hellip;and when to strike.<br/><br/>Enemy at the Gates covers the entire period from 19 November 1942 to mid-March 1943. There are numerous one and two map scenarios.

It covers the entirety of World War II in Europe from September 1939 to the end of 1945.<br/><br/>Europe Engulfed plays fast with its focus on playability and making players feel the pressures their historical counterparts were under. The game achieves this level of playability without sacrificing historical detail. The entire campaign is playable in a single 10-to-14 hour day once players become familiar with its elegant game systems including:<br/><br/>Wood Block Units:<br/>Wood blocks for land units provide a realistic fog of war. Only the controlling player can see if their units are armor or infantry, weak or strong until combat is engaged. The inability to know the strength of your opponent ensures that even the most experienced players will make their fair share of tactical and strategic errors.<br/><br/>Production and Strategic Warfare:<br/>Europe Engulfed Game Turns represent two months each and production and strategic warfare takes place within each of these turns. The inventive production system shows that the conquering power does not get the same value out of resource areas as the original power that lost them. Production levels are easy to calculate and production choices include special actions, fleets, U-boats, strategic fighter and bomber assets, ground-support units, flak, V-weapons, and, of course, lots and lots of armor and infantry and the odd paratrooper or cavalry unit from which to choose.<br/><br/>Special Actions:<br/>Special actions are an innovative rule system to account for the large historical territorial gains that occurred over the course of a two-month game turn without bogging the game down with multiple player turns. Using Special Actions, players can purchase additional movement phases and combat rounds, amphibious and airborne assaults, and even take actions during an opponent's combat phase.<br/><br/>Rulebook and Playbook:<br/>The 24-page rulebook is clearly written with many examples. Also included is a 24-page playbook. The playbook includes player notes, designer notes, optional rules, scenarios, index, and an extended example of play highlighting the May/June 1940 turn which reveals tactics for successfully attacking and defending.<br/><br/>Europe Engulfed plays quickly with a very historical feel. Many players have indicated that they actually feel the pressures and stresses felt by the strategic level commanders in the real war.

Because no matter whether they are stonemasons from the north or horticulturalists from the south, they all want a proper wage and insist on their &quot;native&quot; currency.  With their help towers can be constructed, gardens laid out, pavilions and arcades erected and seraglios and chambers built.<br/><br/>In Alhambra, players are acquiring buildings to be placed within their Alhambra complex.<br/><br/>The money in Alhambra comes in four different currencies and is available in the open money market.  The 54 buildings of six types become available for purchase in the building market four at a time; one building is available in each of the four different currencies.  On a player's turn, a player may 1) take money from the open money market, 2) purchase a building from the building market and either place it in his Alhambra or reserve, or 3) engage in construction and re-construction projects with buildings that have been placed in the player's Alhambra or reserve. The game rewards efficiency, as when a player purchases a building from the market for the exact amount of money, the player may take another turn.<br/><br/>Players with the most buildings in each of the six building types in his Alhambra score in each of the scoring phases, and points are awarded for players' longest external &quot;wall&quot; section within their complex.

The four-game series included Mighty Warriors, Ultra Marines, Kerrunch, and Space Fleet. The game includes dice, floor tiles, door stand-ups, 36 highly detailed Citadel Miniatures, and reference cards for army lists and spells.<br/><br/>In Mighty Warriors, players choose from either a band of Heroes or Skaven Ratmen. The Heroes are led by a Noble Knight, a Fearless Dwarf, and a Heroic Elf while the Skaven Ratmen are led by a Chaos Wizard and four Skaven Champions. The Elf and Chaos Wizard can cast spells. The other characters have differing combat abilities.<br/><br/>Players set up the castle from modular floor tiles, which are then connected by stand-up doors. The players then position their forces throughout the rooms of the castle. Finally a &ldquo;shield&rdquo; for each side is placed.<br/><br/>The game is played in phases including Magic, Movement, Missile Combat, Melee Combat, and Recovery from Stuns. Each player attacks the other while moving from one room of the castle to another. A player wins by capturing the opponent&rsquo;s shield.<br/><br/>This game is basically a &ldquo;light&rdquo; version of HeroQuest or Warhammer Quest, more of a skirmish style than exploration, Dungeon Crawl.

This card will serve as the first panel in the collaborative comic strip that will emerge as a result of gameplay. On her turn, a player will then select a single card from her hand, and place that card face up and to the right of the emerging comic strip. A judge or judges (usually the other players) then vote on the appropriateness of that particular panel to the unfolding narrative.

They do so by completing tasks from the activity cards. <br/>The first area of the board shows a track consisting of spaces in six different colours. There is one pawn for all the players. Players take turns rolling the die and move the pawn accordingly.

Here, each player has a car pawn. Players try to reach the finish line as fast as possible. Obstacle tokens and event spaces make you lose or win family members. If a player lands on a space that is already occupied, he/she can steal a family member to fill an empty spot in their own car.<br/><br/>The first player to reach the finish line wins the game.<br/><br/>"}, "6359": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "2", "poll": [], "name": "Lakeedah", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2003", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games", "Wargames"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic24742_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Tekeiles Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic24742.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Wargame"], "age": "9", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Lakeedah is an exciting strategy game that's fast to learn and helps build critical thinking and planning skills while having fun.

If you do not like the cards in your hand, you think another player MAY have a better hand, play the Change Hands to the discard pile and change hands with him.  Other examples of action cards are the Moving Cards, these cards when played, will move the entire hand of all players ether two players left or one player right. The Totally Insane Card Game includes Draw 2, Draw 4, and Take 2, cards that make the next player ether Draw 2 or Draw 4 cards from the draw pile, or Take 2 cards from any player. Of course the draw cards add together so you might have to draw 6 or 8 cards. In Totally Insane, players could take cards from your hand, helping you get rid of your cards, while adding cards to their hand.  The Totally Insane Card Game has a Totally Useless Card this card is exactly what it says totally useless.  At no time can the Totally Useless Card be played to the discard pile.  So what do you do with a card you can&rsquo;t play to the discard pile?   Simple, you give it to anther player so he can&rsquo;t play it either. (If you can&rsquo;t play it, you can&rsquo;t go out.) You can give it away with cards like the Change Hands, Moving Card, or a Forced Kindness.  When you play a Forced Kindness to the discard pile, you give two cards from your hand to any player.  You never know who will be picked on next.

Players can play tiles from their hands off of the turned down tiles, as if starting from the beginning (tiles placed before the turned-down tiles cannot be used to form hands).<br/><br/>Note: Do not turn the tiles over upon creating 2 pairs and 4 of a Kind.

Everything you need, except a playing surface, is here - over 100 miniatures, an easy-to-understand rulebook, lots of counters, dice and even a ruler.<br/><br/>The object of the game is simple - to defeat your enemy using any tactics or strategem you can find.  In Fantasy Warriors there's much more to battle than launching your army in a head on attack - discover the perils and rewards of scouting, boasts, omens, threats and, of course, magic.<br/><br/>Each player controls an army, headed by a war chief who issues orders to the troops under his command.  Giving the right orders and changing them when the moment is right is the essence of generalship in Fantasy Warriors.  How well will you do in the battle of wits between opposing players?<br/><br/>You can play the game with forces of any size, from small skirmishes of 20 to 40 figures a side to epic clashes between several armies, containing hundreds of figures.  Battles may be fought between two players, each with an army, or groups of players forming tabletop alliances.  You don't need any sort of referee or games master.<br/><br/>There's no book keeping in Fantasy Warriors and, after you have decided on your forces, there's no need for pencil and paper.  Once the battle is under way, the colourful counters supplied with the game will give you all the information you need.<br/><br/>From the back of the box:<br/><br/>Fantasy Warriors is a complete game set for playing exciting fantasy wargames with finely detailed Grenadier miniatures - all you need to provide is a table and the desire to enjoy yourself.

Each player begins in an unknown location on an island (the opponent picks where the other starts), and each has the same goal: find the hidden treasure. The treasure is hidden in one of 28 spots on the island, and there are 7 clues available in special checkpoints to help determine where it is. The island is made up of 5 different types of terrain, and for each type of terrain there is a set of corresponding hexes.<br/><br/>In play, one player calls a direction (Northeast, South, etc.) and the other player (who knows where you are) reveals a hex on the type of terrain you just stepped into. On the back of the hex there is a number, showing how many hours have been used.  Each turn, a player gets 12 hours worth of movement. By moving this way, you can eventually figure out where you are and then start moving with more accuracy.<br/><br/>The game uses a clever device that reveals only one spot of a 6 x 6 matrix. A card, from a large set, is initially placed and this determines where the treasure will be for that game. When players get to a checkpoint, they can reveal that spot on the card to get a clue. The clues can tell you which of 4 types of treasure spots is &quot;live&quot;, and also the six surrounding terrain types.
