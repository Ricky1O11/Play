Their days were filled with prayer, meditation, and training. As part of their training, they played a single board game. The game was elegant in its simplicity, yet complicated in its mastery. For generations the game was a closely guarded secret and used by the monks to train new acolytes in the art of traversing the narrow passages and treacherous peaks of the Himalayas.<br/><br/>One day, while the monks were attempting to cross a particularly narrow bit of mountain, a copy of the game was swept away in a snowstorm. It was brought down the mountain by an avalanche and eventually recovered by a small boy from a remote village. The boy was so intrigued by the game that he left his home to wander the mountains, track down the monks and learn the ways of the Malu.<br/><br/>Many years passed and the boy eventually grew to be an intelligent man, possessing all the secrets of the Malu. He eventually returned to civilization and brought with him the game of the Malu. By sheer chance (or perhaps fate), he has deemed you a worthy challenger. It is now time for you to test your skills... Do you have what it takes to out-think and out-maneuver your opponent and cross the mountain pass in MALU?<br/><br/><br/>The objective of the game is to move both your pawns across the map to the other side of the board and exit the map. The first player to have both their pawns exit the map wins.<br/><br/>The mechanics of the game are simple enough that anyone can pick up and start playing, but the depth of skill and many possible strategies to employ, allows for seasoned players to truly be masters of MALU.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player must move their pawn and place a neutral tile onto the board. As you place your tiles, adjoining tiles create paths that your pawns can move along. As your pawn moves, you have the ability to pick up those tiles and reroute them to your advantage... either as a path to the other side or as a means to block your opponents. But be careful... if you get too close, your opponent can snatch those tiles away from you and use them for themselves! You can also place walls of ice and mountain peaks as obstacles or knock down walls for strategic advantages.<br/><br/>Like many other classic games... first one to the finish wins! But in MALU, you will need to muster all your skill and cunning to make it past your opponent and be the first across the mountain pass.<br/><br/>"}, "222006": {"poll": [], "name": "Flute Master - Epic Christmas", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android edition", "iOS edition", "Macintosh Downloadable edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon"], "usersrated": "0", "videogameexpansion": ["Flute Master"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Insignio Labs"], "videogamegenre": ["Educational"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone", "Macintosh", "Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Insignio Labs"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Christmas-themed levels and music pack for the Flute Master music learning game by Insignio Labs.<br/><br/>"}, "222007": {"poll": [], "name": "Flute Master - Trick or Treat", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android edition", "iOS edition", "Macintosh Downloadable edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon", "Music"], "usersrated": "0", "videogameexpansion": ["Flute Master"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Insignio Labs"], "videogamegenre": ["Educational"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone", "Macintosh", "Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Insignio Labs"], "description": "User Summary<br/>Halloween-themed levels and music pack for the Flute Master music learning game by Insignio Labs.<br/><br/>"}, "222008": {"rpgdesigner": ["John Abrahamson", "Robert K.

Our regular gaming group met in South Minneapolis most Friday nights at Viking Computers on 24th and Nicollet, and often got back on our bikes to ride home early Sunday morning. One such Friday we were introduced to Fred, who would be running his campaign that evening, and I did not know what kind of ride I was in for. It was the first of many delightful moments in Fred&rsquo;s World that spanned more than a decade of gaming a two plus decades of friendship. While the players changed on occasion, the events in Ethelbertville took us ever deeper into his particular rabbit hole.<br/><br/>In 1989 a concerted effort to document Fred&rsquo;s particular world was undertaken at the behest of Fred, with the largest share of the effort performed by Andrew Sabo. Additional contributions were made by Craig Martin, Keith Westrum and myself. Artwork by Lou Frank in 1987 was added to the campaign and the most formalized set of documents to date were created.<br/><br/>This memorial edition of his campaign is a collection of his First Edition documents from 1989 in a single volume. As I have received comments on the pre-release version I wish to address a few things before the ride begins. These documents were written in 1989 and reflect both the campaign at that time as well as the recollections of its author Fred Funk. As has been noted by reviewers there are date inconsistencies, incorrect publishing references and claims anachronistically out of place. I attribute these errors to the faulty nature of memories and not of any intent to assign accomplishments to incorrect parties. The exact years and certain details as remembered by Fred are not considered to be completely accurate by game historians.<br/><br/>Fred worked hard on his campaign, and it is a pleasure to compile his efforts for others to enjoy. In this electronic age, it is my intention to see his campaign spread as far and wide as I can so that the memory of his world, and of the man, can last as long as possible.<br/><br/>"}, "222079": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3463961.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Galaxy of Trian"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Seweryn Piotrowski"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Jakub Mathia", "Andrzej Sykut", "Barbara Wiszy\u0144ska", "Natalia Zaorska"], "boardgamepublisher": ["CreativeMaker LLC"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3463961_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Miniatures", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration", "Territory Building"], "description": "Galaxy of Trian is a dynamic tile-based game in which players act as commanders of alien races.

Italy, 1805-1815).<br/><br/>Napoleon and his Marshals covers 1805-1815 in France and Central Europe. Other expansions are underway that will add the Peninsular War, the Patriotic War in Russia and maps of Scandinavia and the rest of Italy. The game is strategic and operational. Each strategic turn is two months, broken down into 6 10-day operational turns.Forces are division level (5,000 men) per factor, with artillery, cavalry, Cossacks, and guerillas as additional specialized units. Leaders are included at the National Military Leader (Napoleon, Kutusov, etc.), Army commanders, and marshals/corps commanders. Combat units for 11 nations are included. In the expansions the naval war is added, with Nelson, other British Admirals, along with French, Spanish, and Russian admirals, and the navies of those countries and Denmark and Sweden, along with the armies of Spain and Portugal.<br/><br/>This is the basic game, required to play all other expansions and the campaign game, which will run from January 1805 through the end of 1815 or the final victory. Included is a 31&quot; x 23.5&quot; map, printed on plastic coated reinforced &quot;banner&quot; paper (which is rolled up for storage), and 5 counter sheets of 88 counters, printed front and back, and slightly larger than traditional counters at 0.6&quot; square. Map scale is about 28 miles to 38 miles per hex (depending on where you are on the map).<br/><br/>During the Strategic Turns, nations collect taxes (production) and expend it on organization and units, including leader activation, replacements, new units, mobilization, sea lift capacity, foreign aid, supplies, and other items.

It is not so much about monsters and magic as it is about how the influence of the fey can change the feel and flow of a campaign, and it gives you a game-mechanical system for describing and representing that in-breaking of raw, untamed, primal magic that make the fey what they are. Fey do not simply walk about within the world; they carry their version of the world along with them, and make our world more like theirs with every step. The rumors and ripples and ruptures in our reality really lay the groundwork for enriching any campaign where civilization is not the only power in the world, and where the force and spirit of nature can push right back.<br/><br/>Like its companion product, Faerie Passions, this product provides a fantastic primer on the use of fey creatures in a campaign, balancing the hardcore game rules with explorations of fey creatures' mythological origins and role in real-life history and legends. What this product is really about is making fey different, to make them strange, unpredictable, and menacing in turn. They are never quite what you expect, and this product describes subtle shifts you can use to create an interesting variety of alternate creatures. The fey represent the raw and wild extremes of the life and spirit of the land and those that dwell within it, possessed of a mercurial emotionality and an integration with the natural world that flits between an impossibly saturated hyper-reality and the dreamily surreal. A campaign featuring the fey should feel different than other campaigns, and when you introduce Faerie Mysteries, it will.

But the names and signs of Pubs have a rich and fascinating story to tell, which is celebrated in this highly original card game. Easy to learn and tremendous fun to play!<br/><br/>Players start with a hand of 5 cards and must play them all to win. To play a card you must play a pub whose symbol matches the last card played. Symbols form suits and there are 11 in the game. There are also some special cards to spice things up for the next player (miss a turn, reverse play direction). A series of 3x cards (eg 3 Barrels) also require the next player to pick up 3 cards. This can be defeated with another 3x card causing the next player to pick up 6 and so on.<br/><br/>When down to the last card, the player must call &quot;time gentleman please&quot; or &quot;last order&quot; or gain a penalty card. When the last card is played, the winner scores the value of all other players remaining cards. Rounds continue until target score (eg 50) is achieved.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "7", "name": "Red Lion", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "average": "7", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Shedding Games"]}, "222275": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Ash Maczko"], "average": "8.2", "poll": [], "name": "Squarriors: The Card Game", "playingtime": "75", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Deck / Pool Building", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Player Elimination"], "yearpublished": "2017", "usersrated": "5", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3493798_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Ashley Witter"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Cold War Incorporated"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3493798.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "75", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Card Game", "Civilization", "Comic Book / Strip", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Medieval", "Wargame"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "35", "description": "Squarriors: The Card Game is a tabletop game based off of the comic book series, Squarriors.

Many adventurers are familiar with wading into combat against monsters and small groups of enemies, but this is nothing next to the glory and chaos and carnage that is true war. More than simply a change in scale, the difference between war and other combat can be profound. In a war, the characters are part of something larger than themselves, contributing to the efforts of their armies, or perhaps leading those armies themselves. The priorities of a soldier are different from those of an adventurer, and often the challenges that they face are, as well. While many characters can translate their talents as adventurers to the battlefield, one who specifically focuses on warfare and battlefield tactics will have the edge on others when it comes to true war. Each installment of Weekly Wonders: Archetypes of War provides six new war-themed archetypes for a variety of classes.<br/><br/>For this book, we focus on scouts and spies. Though they&rsquo;re rarely found on the front lines, they nonetheless place themselves in incredible danger, going into the lion&rsquo;s den to extract their enemy&rsquo;s secrets or sabotage their efforts, knowing all the while that one wrong move could spell their doom, and no one will be coming to help them if things go awry. This book features archetypes designed for scouting and spying, whether it&rsquo;s by stealth, guile, or other means.<br/><br/>    The battlefield infiltrator, an investigator archetype whose skills are more suited to battlefield infiltration, and siege warfare.<br/>    The psychic interrogator, a mesmerist archetype that can dive deep into the minds of others to uncover their secrets.<br/>    The monk of the silent wind, a monk archetype that can render himself silent and invisible, and deliver deadly assassin strikes.<br/>    The double agent, a vigilante archetype that has two social identities and two vigilante identities, and fights on both sides of a given conflict.<br/>    The far watcher, a witch archetype that allows her familiar to do the spying while she remains at a safe distance.<br/>    A bonus archetype for the stalker, from Path of War by Dreamscarred Press, the shadow knight can control shadows to conceal himself, protect him against attacks, and escape from his foes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "222323": {"rpgartist": ["Eric Quigley"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Breachworld Character Folio #1: 402", "rpgdesigner": ["Jason Richards"], "rpgproducer": ["Jason Richards"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3446955.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Breachworld"], "rpgpublisher": ["Jason Richards Publishing"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Multiverse", "Science Fiction (Post Apocalypse)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3446955_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Welcome to the first Character Folio for the Breachworld RPG, featuring a possible antagonist, ally, foil, or all of the above in the form of a relentless<br/>mechanical assassin.

Plates come in varied shapes such as bars, circles, half-circles, T-shapes, and X-shapes. They may hold as few as one and as many as eight treasure slots, and they may not be stationary. Some feature hinges that cause them to rotate when hit, while others shift or rotate positions when hit. The player usually has the ability to cycle between two treasures before firing.<br/><br/>If a player manages to hit a high matching slot, the treasure will usually tumble and fill one or more lower slots for a combo bonus; each successive tumble increases the bonus and the chance of a power-up popping up. Bank shots earn extra points; when a treasure makes an inordinate amount of banks shots before filling a slot, the player is given a &quot;Lucky shot&quot; bonus. Once a grouping of slots are filled, that grouping vanishes and awards the player more points.<br/><br/>A fired treasure can be diverted by obstacles that include bumpers (stone walls or ledges off of which treasures will bounce), locks and blocks (barriers that require a specific treasure to unlock), bricks (obstacles that crumble when hit), chutes (cylinders that redirect any treasure fired into them), shelves (special plates that hold a number of treasures), teleports (swirly objects that warp treasures from point to point) and baskets (baskets that catch treasures and then drop them). If a player misfires, the treasure will either shatter after a long period of bouncing around the screen, or it will plunge into the water, costing the player one of three lives for that level. The player may prevent this by catching the treasure before it plunges.<br/><br/>After each section of a building is completed, the water level rises to introduce a new part of the building, until all the sections are completed to finish the level.<br/><br/>When a level is completed, the player receives scoring for accuracy, speed of completion, number of combos scored, and how many tries the player took to complete a level.<br/>Game modes<br/><br/>The game includes four game modes, three of which must be unlocked:<br/><br/>Journey: Basic gameplay<br/>    Flood: An action mode in which the river level rises at a steady rate. Icons that splash in the water no longer cost the player, but sections must be completed before the water level engulfs them or the level is failed.<br/>    Survival: Like Flood mode, but a single building that never ends.<br/>    Trick shots: Nothing but trick shots. The player is given a reward of 1,000 points for a successful trick shot, incrementing 1,000 points with each successful trick shot, and resetting to 1,000 after a failure.<br/><br/>There are 72 total buildings (levels) in the game among 8 neighborhoods.

It's a game about intense life and death conflicts, adventure with peril around every corner, deep stories, involved characters, and no holds barred combat.<br/><br/>Song of Swords isn't a game with hit points or ablative health. Here, injuries are devastating, debilitating, and dead-serious affairs. Even blows that don't kill immediately can kill with blood loss or infection from sloppy treatment. Survivors may suffer limps, lameness and even crippling disability. You will need sharp wits, thick armor, quick feet, great martial skill, or a combination of several of them, to survive.<br/><br/>You decide your character's goals, and through the Arc Points system, your character grows by progressing toward these goals, in addition to those chosen by the Gamemaster to give structure to the game's narrative. Violence may be a means to an end, but its danger means that you must pick your battles wisely, instead of charging headfirst into every combat situation.<br/><br/>Whether you fancy a campaign as 15th century Englishmen fighting in France under Henry V, or a desperate last stand against the Mongols in Hungary, Song of Swords can provide your historical role-playing experience. Perhaps you&rsquo;re more interested in fighting Grues in the hideous depths of the Kaselreich, or fighting Goblins in the brutal tunnels of Cross Way beneath the iron hills of Dace.

And it's about things whose very existence cackles at the laws of nature. These creatures defy accurate description, view people as mere insects, and can drive you out of your mind (sometimes literally) simply by standing before you.<br/><br/>This game can be played by any number of players; either solo, same side, or head to head.<br/><br/>In Lovecraft's Revenge, players control one or more characters in an rpg-like Lovecraftian adventure. Each adventure has a goal and the goal is attained by collecting clues and managing to survive the ordeal with mind and body intact. The game unfolds through a number of scenes at various general locations. Each location will likely have some kind of encounter. Some encounters will surely be of a combat nature, but others might involve solving puzzles or interacting with npc's within the adventure.<br/><br/>"}, "222374": {"rpgartist": ["Conceptopolis", "Aaron H\u00fcbrich", "Rudy Siswanto"], "rpgitemversion": ["Hardback Version", "PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Gods and Goddesses", "rpgdesigner": ["Ben McFarland", "jim pinto"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3372323.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgproducer": ["Aaron H\u00fcbrich", "Andreas Walters"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Jetpack 7"], "average": "0", "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["(Upcoming Releases)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3372323_t.png", "description": "<br/><br/><br/>    <br/>        <br/>UNRELEASED GAME<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        <br/>This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future.

Dwarves came to Ghaol Dhalld more than 3000 years ago, and by 2250 years past reached the Moer Vale, establishing a silver mine at the foot of Wydorrith Mountain. Over the next 500 years the Dwarves found gold on Juttermad Mountain, iron on Mount Paagdoon, and coal on Ker Wert and Mountain Trewk. They also founded the town of Kolli on Lake Moer, and the villages Lokdell and Mantry.

If the movement of the ball ends on one of the three numbered spaces in front of the goal, the goalie catches the ball, if he rolls one of the numbers shown on the space the ball is in.<br/><br/>After an agreed on playing time the player who gets the most goals wins the game.<br/><br/>"}, "222416": {"rpgdesigner": ["Bob Bingham", "Bob Bledsaw", "Steven Brandt", "Philip Brewer", "David Dougher", "Bill Hayes", "Bob Hennelly", "Bryan Hinnen", "Jennell Allyn Jaquays", "Bill Paley", "Dave Petrowski", "Brian Wagner"], "statistics": [], "name": "Judges Guild Journal (Issue 17 - Oct/Nov 1979)", "rpgartist": ["Darlene", "Sheryl England", "Jennell Allyn Jaquays", "Kevin Siembieda", "Pamela Colman Smith"], "rpgproducer": ["Chuck Anshell", "Bob Bingham", "Penny Gooding"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgissue": ["The Judges Guild Journal"], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (Original Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Judges Guild"], "rpgissueversion": ["Print Edition"], "poll": [], "description": "Features:<br/>The Wilderness Project<br/>The Nightmare Flask<br/>Belegost<br/>Farlin Ironshod<br/>The Adventures of Antoinne De Rebbierre<br/>From Tavern to Dungeon<br/>Heraldry Tables<br/>Martial Artists<br/>Designer's Notes - Dark Tower<br/>The Mythos of Har<br/><br/>"}, "222417": {"rpgartist": ["Robert Hemminger"], "rpg": ["One Knight Games"], "poll": [], "name": "Wrecking Crew", "rpgdesigner": ["A.

About heavy fights indicates the following fact - for the crossing of the Dnieper in 2438 soldiers were awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union, which is more than the total amount awarded for the entire previous history of the awards. This title was awarded to not only the commanders of battalions and regiments, but also up to the distinguished junior officers (NCOs). Such mass awarding a single operation was the only one in the history of war. In memory of all the fallen Soviet soldiers dedicated to this game. We remember.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The game is designed for two players - one led by the Red Army, the other - Wehrmacht troops entrenched on the banks of the Dnieper. Soviet Player has 6 turns not only to cross the river and take a foothold, but also to keep it to the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game has simple rules and takes 30-60 minutes.

If the party defeats the boss, they win, and gain an Epic Treasure Card. Otherwise, they die and lose the game.<br/><br/>The objective of the Solo version of the game is to accomplish your character's End Goal before s/he becomes too cowardly, despairing, mad, reviled, or too dead to continue adventuring.<br/><br/>Different End Goals include: Becoming Accomplished (in a certain discipline or skill), becoming Powerful, being Revered as a god, becoming Renowned (for performing feats), or by attaining great Wealth.<br/><br/>To accomplish the End Goal, the adventurer travels from Location Card to Location Card.<br/><br/>When the adventurer enters a Location, s/he can do one of four things: Make Camp (to hunt and rest), Interact with the displayed NPC, do Trade (rolling on a table), or Explore the Location.<br/><br/>To explore, the Location Card is flipped over, revealing an Encounter. Encounters represent monsters, traps, or perilous situations that must be defeated. Successfully defeating these encounters results in gaining XP and Treasure Cards.<br/><br/>The XP can be used to eventually gain up to three Levels. Each new level has three Skill Cards you can choose from. You place the acquired Skill Card below your Adventurer Card.<br/><br/>Each Encounter displays from one to three Impact Icons, which signify how dangerous, horrifying, and taxing the encounter is to resolve. Unless the adventurer immediately avoids (or escapes) the encounter, s/he will be impacted by interacting with it.<br/><br/>The Encounter Impact will add to the character's Personality, which in turn, affects how effective s/he will be during subsequent encounters.<br/><br/>In addition to encounter impacts, there are Event Cards that come into play for different durations that also display Impact Icons on them.<br/><br/>Whenever conditions in play match those specified on active Event Cards, the event impacts the adventurer. The Event Card is then placed under the Adventurer Card, with the Event Card's bottom section visible from the appropriate side of the Adventurer Card.<br/><br/>A possible outcome of the event is that the character becomes mentally afflicted, emotionally disturbed, or physically maimed.<br/>Thus, as the adventure continues, the character may become too emotionally, psychologically, or physically weak to continue to pursue his or her End Goal. In this case, the adventurer loses the game.<br/><br/>Conversely, the adventurer wins the game by enduring encounters and events (some of which are positive), and by attaining his or her End Goal.<br/><br/>Each End Goal lists varying levels of success, so you always try to score higher in subsequent gaming sessions.<br/><br/>"}, "222496": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Michael Szymanski"], "poll": [], "name": "Ashram", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Szymanski Spil"], "boardgameversion": ["First version"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Trivia"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A quiz game by Michael Szymanski. 10,000 questions.<br/><br/>"}, "222497": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Michael Szymanski"], "poll": [], "name": "Sportsn\u00f8rd", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Szymanski Spil"], "boardgameversion": ["First version"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Trivia"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A quiz game by Michael Szymanski. 4,500 questions.<br/><br/>"}, "222498": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Michael Szymanski"], "poll": [], "name": "Mir", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Szymanski Spil"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Trivia"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A quiz game by Michael Szymanski. 20,000 questions<br/><br/>"}, "222499": {"poll": [], "name": "Monopoly: Treasures of Greece", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Player Elimination", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Monopoly"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3472584_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Hasbro"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3472584.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Negotiation"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Special edition by Shell with the most valuable monuments of Greece.<br/><br/>"}}
