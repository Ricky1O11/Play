It is a two-player alternative history game intended to examine what could've happened during the first month of fighting had the Soviets opted to invade Germany during the Cold War.  An assumption is made that the invasion would've been executed without lengthy preparation or forewarning.<br/><br/>This game is an update and revision of SPI's 1973 release, &quot;NATO: Operational Combat in Europe in the 1970s&quot;. Its time and space scales have been preserved, but the map has been improved by reflecting a more in depth terrain analysis. The system has been updated and the orders of battle are more fully developed. Air warfare has been added, at least as an abstract, and tactical nukes have been taken away except as possible game enders.<br/><br/>The orders of battle for both sides are based on open-source documents that have become available since the parent game was first published. The system, though more complex than that of the original game, still comes in toward the lower end of today's complexity scale. Experienced gamers can expect to be blasting away within 90 minutes or so of first opening the box.<br/><br/>Each hexagon on the map represents approximately 10 miles (16.2 kilometers) from side to opposite side. The Soviet units of maneuver are divisions, as are most NATO units, along with a few brigades and regiments. Each full game turn represents two days.<br/><br/>The game map illustrates the militarily significant terrain found in the western portion of Germany and its environs in the late 1970s. There are 280 unit counters in the game, most of which represent combat formations.

Each Player maneuvers his pieces on the map to engage those of the enemy. Battles take place when units are adjacent to enemy units. The total relative strengths of the involved units are compared. The attacking Player consults a simple probability table (the Combat Results Table) to determine the outcome of each battle. Then the other Player moves his units and conducts attacks. The game proceeds this ways (for a specified number of turns) as the Players try to achieve the historical objectives set forth in the rules. The final outcome of the game can be very different from the actual historical result.

Each player takes 27 regular chips (one will use the pink side while the other will use the orange side), 2 double chips and 1 stop chip. Each player puts all his chips into the holder and takes 3 scoring pegs in his color. The scoring pegs allow tracking scores from zero to 999.<br/><br/>To begin the game, players alternate putting one chip of their color into any of the 4 center holes of the board until all 4 holes are filled. The first player then puts one chip on the board so his chip traps one of his opponent's chips. Trapping is custodial, as in Hnefetafl or Othello/Reversi, in any of the eight directions from the just-placed chip. Once a player traps an opponent's chip, he turns it over to his own color. Players score 1 point for each chip in the new row which has been formed (including the just-played chip and the own-color cap chips). Players may trap multiple chips at once or chips in multiple rows.<br/><br/>Once a double chip is on the board, any row which contains it is worth double (for either player). If there are multiple double chips involved, they're added together before applying the multiplication (thus 3 double chips is sextuple score, 4 double chips is octuple score).<br/><br/>If an opponent turns over a player's stop chip, this prevents the trapped chips in that row from turning over and voids the opponent's score for that row.<br/><br/>The game ends when all holes on the board are filled. At the end of the game, each player adds one point for each chip of his color remaining on the board.<br/><br/>The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>"}, "10315": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic42616.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1997", "maxplayers": "6", "age": "4", "boardgamepublisher": ["Milton Bradley"], "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic42616_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Children's Game", "Electronic"], "description": "Place the game board on the table.

The counters are placed in the box, thus creating a Log Cereal Box. The History Eraser strip is placed in the middle of the table.<br/>In a turn, a player reaches in to the Cereal Box and pulls out a counter.

All players might have to slide their comic strip to the person on their right or left. Or you might be able to take one counter of another player's comic strip and put it back into the box.

A play is registered after each down or when a team scores.<br/><br/>From scrimmage, players line up their formations. The offensive team lines up first and the ball is placed on top of the Center. The first down marker is placed 10 yards forward. On his turn, the offensive player gets three moves with which he can move one man three spaces, one man two spaces and another one space or three men one space each. The defensive player makes his three moves after the offensive player. Once the defensive player has made his three moves, the offensive player moves once again. Play continues until the ball carrier is tackled, a team scores or an incomplete pass is thrown. In order to tackle the ball carrier, the defensive player must land one of his men on the square occupied by the ball carrier. Dice rolls are used to resolve passing.<br/><br/>The team with the highest score at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Description from rulebook<br/>The N.F.L. ALL PRO FOOTBALL GAME is the closest thing to real football ever devised! Every play possible on the real gridiron can occur in N.F.L. ALL PRO FOOTBALL! Now, for the first time, you control your entire team . . . not with cards, dice or spinners&mdash;but by actually moving the players. You see every play unfold in front of you and victory or defeat is determined entirely by your skill as offensive quarterback or defensive captain. Since this is the first time you will be moving an entire team on the playing field, study the layout of the playing field and the way each man moves.

The game also adds condition cards that are played after a round of auctions is completed. It simulates that moment when you finally open the box that you've just purchased. With condition cards, you can find anything from a designer's autograph to mildew. The game also comes with a complete description of the companies and games that are up for sale.

Players take turns asking each other for cards matching the ones in their hands, each card being named after a particular fish (or fish-related being, such as Atlantean Priests or Mermaids). When a player manages to get a pair, they place it face-up on the table in front of them, just like in Go Fish. Once the cards hit the table, the Magic: the Gathering aspects come into play, as most of the fish have unique powers that can be used to aid you or annoy your opponents. There are also unique cards (with names like &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; and &quot;Offshore Oil Rig&quot;), which have more esoteric powers and move from player to player as they get used. When one player runs out of cards in their hand, everyone scores a point for each pair they possess, and a new hand is dealt until every player has dealt once, at which point the final scores are tallied and a winner is declared. (Game time is thus dependant on number of players -- my guess of 90 minutes is a rough estimate of a 6-player game, which may not be at all accurate.)<br/><br/>In many ways, Leviathan epitomizes the &quot;beer-and-pretzels&quot; game -- in fact, it was designed in a coffee shop, out of a need for something to do while sitting in a coffee shop. The rules encourage a light (&quot;jovially rude&quot;) atmosphere, and the writing style generally reflects this, although careful attention has been paid to the way the various cards interact, and to fix any possible contradictions or loopholes. (And the rule set has been edited to remove unnecessary rudeness in the author's writing style, although -- shh! -- an &quot;impolite&quot; version of the rules is rumored to exist, somewhere...)<br/><br/>Players are encouraged to devise new card powers and game variations, and as a bonus for players south of the equator, a special &quot;Southern Hemisphere&quot; option is given, which explains the way the Coriolis Effect changes the order of play.<br/><br/>"}, "10033": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Monopoly: Las Vegas", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Dice Rolling", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Set Collection", "Stock Holding", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "2000", "usersrated": "44", "boardgamefamily": ["Cities: Las Vegas (Nevada, USA)", "Monopoly"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic41878_t.jpg", "average": "5.625", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Parker Brothers", "USAopoly"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic41878.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["USAopoly Edition", "USAopoly edition 1997"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Negotiation"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "A monopoly (from Greek monos &mu;\u03cc&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf; (alone or single) + polein &pi;&omega;&lambda;&epsilon;\u1fd6&nu; (to sell)) exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity.<br/><br/>Monopoly is a roll-and-move game where players move around the game board buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels.

As Allied forces prepare to storm Normandy&rsquo;s beaches, the fate of Europe is in your hands! In honor of next year&rsquo;s 60th anniversary of D-Day, Avalon Hill will release Axis &amp; Allies D-Day, a new, stand-alone extension of the classic strategy game Axis &amp; Allies. Axis &amp; Allies D-Day will allow players to recreate the largest amphibious invasion in history.<br/><br/>Axis &amp; Allies D-Day features detailed game components including a new blockhouse piece, an extra-large game board, and original artwork commissioned exclusively for the D-Day game box. Other elements of this new Axis &amp; Allies variant include a card deck with three card types -- Orders, Tactics, and Fortune -- to add depth and complexity to play. Order cards determine play sequence and break turns into distinct phases; Tactics cards offer players varied strategic opportunities; and Fortune cards add an element of unpredictability.<br/><br/>Axis &amp; Allies D-Day begins as Operation Overlord, the invasion of German-held Normandy, is underway -- 130,000 soldiers of the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States are poised to assault Fortress Europe. You and your fellow world powers control their fates.<br/><br/>One player controls Germany, whose Axis forces have turned the beaches of Normandy into a near-impenetrable stronghold. Set to breach those defenses are the Allies: the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. The future of Europe and the world hangs in the balance.<br/><br/>Axis &amp; Allies D-Day is designed for two or three players and can be played in two hours. Axis &amp; Allies D-Day is the third Axis &amp; Allies variant, following the successful Axis &amp; Allies Europe and Axis &amp; Allies Pacific, both of which were published in 2001.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "6.39947", "name": "Axis & Allies: D-Day", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Partnerships"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "1672", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Axis & Allies", "Country: France"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Show #26.5 Session Report: Axis &amp; Allies D-Day", "Show #26: Axis &amp; Allies Spectacular"]}, "10082": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic41570.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1981", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "6", "boardgamepublisher": ["Action GT", "Hasbro"], "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic41570_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Children's Game"], "description": "Each baboon has got a bat, got to bash the ball into the hole.

It has been totally revamped and owners of the previous editions may wish to acquire a copy of this one with all the bells &amp; whistles it contains.<br/><br/>First off, they've mounted the game-mapboard-(30&quot; by 46&quot;) to avoid the problems with paper mapsheets(which also increases the cost of doing such). They have improved &amp; updated the graphics for everything all around, and increased the size of the game counters to 5/8&quot;, while that's been factored into the cost as well. Then, they greatly enhanced the current Rulesbook (4th edition) with new scenarios, an additional variant, rules changes &amp; clarifications, included a Players Handbook, updated the designer's notes, and much more! There are full COLOR player aid cards, Random Events are introduced, they've updated the cartography (the map graphics), provided an updated Order of Battle, the hexes have been enlarged to contain the larger game counters, and variant counters are also introduced.<br/><br/>For those of you with distinguishing tastes in their choice of wargames, this has also been acclaimed by the noted designer and expert on the subject, Danny S. Parker. You'll have to go to the l2designgroup.com website to see this as words can't do it justice.

Like many ancient abstract strategy games, the number of pieces and their starting positions varies from region to region but the general play of the game is the same: one player controls a single piece, the fox, the other player controls the geese (usually 13 to 17).  The fox player tries to remove all of the geese from the board by jumping them.  The geese player tries to prevent this from happening by pinning down the fox so that it cannot move.<br/><br/>The game of Solitaire can be played on a Fox &amp; Geese board, and some sets include additional markings for playing Siege.<br/><br/>There are some claims that Fox and Geese is related to an earlier game called Halatafl, but there is as yet no concrete definition of what exactly this game was or how it was played.  There are also several contemporary games using the Halatafl name, at least one of which is played on a similar board to Fox and Geese but with differing rules.<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href='https://av.getinfo.de/media/11310?2' rel='nofollow'>https://av.getinfo.de/media/11310?2</a> ( CC Attribution - NonCommercial - NoDerivatives 3.0 )<br/><a target='_blank' href='http://vimeo.com/51819749' rel='nofollow'>http://vimeo.com/51819749</a><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["ABRA German Wooden Edition", "Amor edition", "Amor German playing people edition", "Drechsler Danish edition", "Game Crafter edition", "Green Board Game Co Edition", "Ikea Promotional Six Languages Edition", "Kronheim First Edition", "Kronheim First Edition", "E S Lowe First Edition", "MB spellen Dutch edition", "McLoughlin Edition", "Milton Bradley Classic Game Edition", "Milton Bradley German edition 1984", "Schmidt Spiele Edition 1986", "Schneider German edition", "Stafford Products Co.
