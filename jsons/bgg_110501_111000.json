Arcanists command elemental forces through willpower and dangerous chemical concoctions, while airships cruise the skies powered by ferociously energetic Hotaether and held aloft by the power of Slack (another technological marvel!) and lucid dreamers explore the mysteries of the dream realms, where they can pluck secrets from the shadows of other's daydreams and imaginations.<br/><br/>The game world itself features a tense geopolitical tussle between two major power blocks, as well as the final and most dangerous phases of European imperialism. Player characters can adventure in the capitals of the great powers, or in cities at the edges of empire, where powers clash and intrigue is never more than a whispered conversation or stolen secret away. Our initial focus is on the city of Constantinople, where the two great alliances jostle for position, and Greeks and Turks alike harbor ambitions and resentments.

ISENBERG.&nbsp;The 1920&rsquo;s saw the perfection of American musical theater, perhaps one of the few innovative contributions of the United States to world culture. Composers such as Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, Jerome Kern, Richard Rogers and George Gershwin, among others, invented what subsequently became the quintessential American musical form. The coincident flourishing of musical theater and horror writing seems to call for a response. Thus, we see in the year 2011 the premiere of &ldquo;Herbert West, Re-Animator, the Musical,&rdquo; at the Steve Allen Theater in Los Angeles.<br/><br/>THE COSTUME PARTY<br/><br/>BY TIM MORIARTY. One of the players in the group receiving an invitation from the eccentric millionaire Andrew Cromley to a costume party on Halloween in the mansion on Crossroads Island found several miles off the coast of Maine. Crossroads Island is famous for ancient rituals that were performed by Native Americans on the site for centuries. Early in the 19th century, a large mansion had been built on the tiny island by a secretive religious order. There were rumors of different rituals being performed by this group for a number of years before they mysteriously all disappeared and were never heard from again. The mansion had remained abandoned for several decades before it was purchased and restored by Cromley. You are free to bring as many friends as you wish.<br/><br/>LEMURALIA<br/><br/>BY OSCAR RIOS. The Roman calendar has many holidays, festivals and holy days. The time is approaching for the feast of Lemuralia, three sacred days (May 9th, 11th and 13th) when all good Romans perform rites to exorcize the unwholesome spirits of the dead from their homes. This was accomplished by making offerings of beans and mola salsa, special salted flower cakes made by the Vestigial Virgins from the first ears of wheat of a harvesting season. Such gifts usually were enough to satisfy the restless dead for another year, but every once in an unfortunate while the dead aren&rsquo;t so easily appeased.<br/><br/>13 BLACK CANDLES<br/><br/>BY JEFF WOODALL.

Halloween brings to mind candy and spooky costumes, where wearing a mask and saying the magic words, &ldquo;trick or treat,&rdquo; rewards those na&iuml;ve hunters in costume a bounty of future tooth decay. But for some adults it is a time of transition both physically and spiritually. The earth is shedding its skin like dead leaves falling and men reflect in fear on the past gone by.

The number of words and the number of letters in each word along with the category of the puzzle is on the clue sheet chosen at random. The gameboard is marked thusly. Before guessing letter, a player must spin the eponymous Wheel of Fortune to determine how much each letter, if revealed, is worth to one&rsquo;s account. Every spin is risk, however, because one could lose a turn or spin &quot;Bankrupt&quot; which means lose a turn and forfeit one&rsquo;s earnings! Consonants only can be guessed after spinning the wheel; vowels can be guessed at a cost.<br/><br/>A player can continue taking one&rsquo;s turn until a wrong guess is made and then the turn passes to the next player. Only the player who solves the word puzzle can keep the earnings made for that round. The player who has made the most money after a predetermined number of puzzles is the winner.<br/><br/>As the title of the game suggests, this version of the game is designed for portability and to be played without a gamemaster to verify responses. The players can check their own responses without revealing to much of the puzzles ahead of time.<br/><br/>The game is a faithful adaptation to the wildly popular television series.<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Pressman Toys First Edition", "Pressman Toys Junior Edition", "Pressman Toys Second Edition", "Tyco First Edition"], "age": "10", "name": "Travel Wheel of Fortune", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Press Your Luck"], "average": "5.25", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["TV Series: Wheel Of Fortune"]}, "110699": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1167590.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Tom Jolly"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Henning Ludvigsen", "Michael Silsby"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Arclight", "Edge Entertainment", "Fantasy Flight Games", "Galakta", "Giochi Uniti", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Wargames Club Publishing"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1167590_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Horror", "Murder/Mystery"], "description": "&ldquo;It was a terrible, indescribable thing vaster than any subway train&mdash;a shapeless congeries of protoplasmic bubbles, faintly self-luminous, and with myriads of temporary eyes forming and un-forming as pustules of greenish light all over the tunnel-filling front that bore down upon us, crushing the frantic penguins and slithering over the glistening floor that it and its kind had swept so evilly free of all litter. &rdquo;<br/>      &ndash;H.

The 9th die has 3 blue sides with a 10 on it, 2 purple sides with a 20 and 1 red side with 40 printed on it.  The object is to NOT roll all of the sides with the same color and complete the 3-Square.<br/><br/>After the dice are rolled all players examine the results.  The Score Die is set in the center of the play area and all other dice that are the same color are set along side it.  If all of the other 8 dice are the same color as the Score Die, the player has completed the 3-Square, the round ends and the player who rolled the dice scores the points showing on the Score Die.  If any of the other 8 dice are not the same color, play passes to the next player.  The second player rolls all of the remaining dice that do not match the color of the Score Die and the other dice that were not set aside.  Play continues in this manner until all of the dice match the color of the Score Die and the player who completed the 3-Square.<br/><br/>There are two little tricks however that can alter the gameplay.  The first is the 10th die...called the Event Die, it has six different sides that can change the results of the dice rolls.  One can end the round immediately, even if the 3-Square has not been completed.  One can allow the player who completed the 3-Square to pass the points to a different player, others double, or even triple the points showing on the Score Die.<br/><br/>Each player is also given 3 Pass Tokens which they can use to skip their turn rolling the dice, shifting the turn to the next player.

Likewise, another large cargo area has been placed between the rear engines and the passenger area.<br/><br/>Passengers and crew enter the craft via a gangplank on the ground that leads to an entry on the bottom level of the craft. Housed on this lower level are the crew quarters. Quarters are divided up with officers housed in between a set of crew quarters. Officers are given the luxury of single beds while the twelve crew members are housed in bunk beds. Spacious showers and bathrooms are also afforded the crew of this magnificent craft.<br/><br/>The second level will not disappoint. Officer and crew messes are located on this level as well as the main kitchen for the ship. However, the bulk of this level is designated for passengers with a sealed smoking cabin, bar, lavatory facilities for both sexes as well as showers for passengers. Both the smoking cabin and bar are lavishly appointed with dark leather furniture and rick mahogany trim.<br/><br/>However , where the Luftschiff Majestic really shines is on the third level. The top level of the passenger area houses forty, double occupancy, passenger births, a dining room, reading area and two grand promenades flanking either side of the ship.

The fragile controllers were now removable, allowing them to be unplugged from the System II for storage or replacement (the original Channel F controllers were hardwired directly into the base unit). In addition, the System II eliminated the covered controller storage compartment, replacing it with two open compartments at the back of the console which the controllers fit into for storage.<br/><br/>One notable functional change was introduced in the System II.

It has the distinction of being the first programmable ROM cartridge-based video game console. Some Channel F games allowed for player versus computer matches, a first in console history. All previous home video games required a human opponent.<br/><br/>The console contains two built-in games, Tennis and Hockey, which were both advanced Pong clones. Sound is played through the Channel F's internal speaker, rather than the TV set. Another unique feature to this console is the 'Hold' button, which allows the player to freeze the game and change game settings (such as speed or time limit) during the course of the game.<br/><br/>The controllers are an unusual variation on an eight-way joystick; the main body is a large rectangular hand grip with a triangular handle sticking out of a hole in the top, the triangle being the portion that actually moved for eight-way directional control. In addition, the triangular handle can be twisted to activate a switch, and not only pushed down to operate as a fire button but also pulled up. The console includes a covered compartment for storing the controllers.<br/><br/>The Channel F electronics were designed by Jerry Lawson using the Fairchild F8 CPU, the first public outing of this processor. The F8 is very complex compared to the typical integrated circuits of the day, and had more inputs and outputs than other contemporary chips. Because chip packaging was not available with enough pins, the F8 is instead fabricated as a pair of chips that had to be used together to form a complete CPU.<br/><br/>Also involved in the creation of the Channel F were Nick Talesfore who was responsible for the industrial design of the hand controllers, console and video game cartridges; and, Ron Smith who was responsible for the mechanical engineering of the video cartridges and the 8-degrees-of-freedom hand controllers.

The console also included two games built into the ROM, Gunfight and Checkmate, along with the simple but useful Calculator and a &quot;doodle&quot; program called Scribbling.<br/><br/>The Bally Professional Arcade featured a relatively complex input device incorporating several types of control mechanisms: the controller was shaped as a pistol-style grip with trigger switch on the front; a small 4-switch/8-way joystick was placed on top of the grip, and the shaft of the joystick connected to a potentiometer, meaning that the stick could be rotated to double as a paddle controller.<br/><br/>On the front of the console was a 24-key &quot;hex-pad&quot; keyboard used for selecting games and options. Most cartridges included two games, and when they were inserted the machine would reset and display a menu starting with the programs on the cartridge and then listing the four built-in programs.<br/><br/>A BASIC programming language cartridge was offered for the system. However, programs were entered, laboriously, through the 24-key keypad. Each of the keys could be used to enter several different values: a single command, number or several alpha characters. These were selected through a set of 4 colored shift keys. For example, to type the command GOTO you would press the gold shift key followed by the &quot;+&quot; key.<br/><br/>On the back of the console were a number of ports, including connectors for power, the controllers, and an expansion port. The top rear of the console was empty was a covered storage compartment that could hold up to 15 cartridges.<br/><br/>Manufacturing History<br/><br/>Originally referred to as the Bally Home Library Computer, the console was released in 1977 but available only through mail order. Delays in the production meant none of the units actually shipped until 1978, and by this time the machine had been renamed the Bally Professional Arcade. In this form it sold mostly at computer stores and had little retail exposure (unlike the Atari 2600). In 1979 Bally grew less interested in the arcade market and decided to sell off their Consumer Products Division, including development and production of the game console.<br/><br/>At about the same time a 3rd party group had been unsuccessfully attempting to bring their own console design to market as the Astrovision. A corporate buyer from Montgomery Ward who was in charge of the Bally system put the two groups in contact, and a deal was eventually arranged. In 1981 they re-released the unit with the BASIC cartridge included for free, this time known as the Bally Computer System, and then changed the name again in 1982 to Astrocade. It sold under this name until the video game crash of 1983, and then disappeared around 1985.<br/><br/>Technical Details<br/><br/>In the late 1970s Midway contracted Dave Nutting Associates to design a video display chip that could be used in all of their videogame systems, from standup arcade games, to a home computer system. The system Nutting delivered remains perhaps the most powerful graphics system of the 8-bit generation, and was used in most of Midway's classic arcade games of the era, including Gorf and Wizard of Wor.<br/><br/>The basic systems were powered by a Zilog Z80 driving the display chip with a RAM buffer in between the two. The display chip had two modes, a low-resolution mode at 160 &times; 102, and a high-resolution mode at 320 &times; 204, both with 2-bits per pixel for four colors. This sort of color/resolution was normally beyond the capabilities of RAM of the era, which could not read out the data fast enough to keep up with the TV display.<br/><br/>The home systems only used the lower resolution 160 &times; 102 mode. In this mode the console used up 160 &times; 102 &times; 2bits = 4080 bytes of memory to hold the screen. Since the machine had only 4k of RAM, this left very little room left over for the program's use, which was used for things like holding the score, or game options. The rest of the program would have to be placed in ROM.<br/><br/>The console used color registers, or color indirection as it was often referred to then, so the four colors could be picked from a palette of 256 colors. Color animation was possible by changing the values of the registers, and using a horizontal blank interrupt you could change them from line to line. An additional set of four color registers could be &quot;swapped in&quot; at any point along the line, allowing you to create two &quot;halves&quot; of the screen, split vertically. Originally intended to allow you to easily create a &quot;score area&quot; on the side of the screen, clever programmers used this feature to emulate 8 color modes.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Bally Astrocade&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "110733": {"poll": [], "name": "WWII Aces", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US Wii edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1122341.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Flight", "Military", "War - World War II"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Arcade Moon"], "videogamegenre": ["Action"], "videogameplatform": ["Wii"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Destineer"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1122341_t.jpg", "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>Experience The Most Frenzied Acrobatic Dogfighting Ever!<br/><br/>Guns blazing, the Messerschmitt Bf-109 screams through the clouds toward you.

The Monster's movements are hidden from the Crew player behind a game screen, and the Monster's location is only revealed when the Monster attacks...or if the crew is lucky (or unlucky) enough to find it!<br/><br/>At the beginning of play, a mysterious specimen in the cargo hold has been let loose as a result of the damage caused by a meteor collision. This SPECIMEN is in an embryonic stage and evolves throughout the game, becoming more difficult to kill as the turns progress. In addition to attempting to kill the crew, the monster can also destroy sections of the ship, forcing the human players to divide their efforts between defense and structural repair. The monster can win the game by either killing all seven members of the crew or damaging enough sections of the ship that it breaks apart. Adding the destruction of the ship as an alternate victory condition allows for varied strategies on the part of both players. The human player can use tools to effect repairs, construct weapons and trackers to hunt down the monster&hellip;or ultimately blow up the ship if all seems lost.<br/><br/>The SPECIMEN player constructs his/her monster from a selection of 25 different attributes (offensive, defensive, or special abilities), providing new and different threats to the human player each game. This constantly changing monster, combined with 90 event cards driving game play, allows for infinite replayability.

While Kirby's Epic Yarn was released in 2010, Kirby's Return to Dream Land is the first traditional Kirby platforming home console game since Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards, which was released in 2000 for the Nintendo 64. The title is currently scheduled for release in North America on October 24, 2011, and in Europe on November 25, 2011.<br/><br/>Kirby's Return to Dream Land features the staple gameplay of traditional Kirby platform games, in which the titular character Kirby possesses the ability to inhale and copy enemies in order to attain forms which give him a variety of attacks such as breathing fire or swinging a sword. The game supports cooperative multiplayer gameplay, allowing up to four players to control various Kirby characters, including Waddle Dee, King Dedede, and Meta Knight. Kirby's plot focuses on the characters retrieving the scattered pieces of a crashed alien spaceship.<br/><br/>The game was first announced as a Nintendo GameCube title with a projected release date of late 2005, but development was later shifted to its successor console, the Wii. While it was later denied that the game was still in development, the game resurfaced in 2009 with an updated release date for that year. The game was then presumed to be cancelled following the announcement of Good-Feel's Kirby's Epic Yarn in 2010, but was then officially re-announced at a financial results briefing on January 28, 2011. The game was then playable at E3 2011 under the tentative title Kirby Wii, with a projected release date of fall 2011 in North America. Its final titles were announced in the following months.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Kirby's Return to Dream Land&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "110793": {"rpgartist": ["Leslie Claussen", "Paul Johnson"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Guildsman (Issue 3 - Winter 1991)", "rpgdesigner": ["Jack De Winter", "Josh Finney", "Todd Groner", "Bradley S.

In response to the criticisms of the Atari 5200, the Atari 7800 could play almost all Atari 2600 games out of the box, without the need for an adapter. In addition, it featured a return to a digital controller.<br/><br/>The 7800 was the first game system from Atari Inc. designed by an outside company, General Computer Corporation (GCC). Design of the system began in 1983.<br/><br/>Following an announcement on May 21, 1984 at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show, the 7800 was initially released in southern California in June 1984. One month later, Warner Communications sold Atari's Consumer Division to Jack Tramiel. All projects were halted during an initial evaluation period.<br/><br/>The 7800 languished on warehouse shelves until it was re-introduced in January 1986 after strong Atari 2600 sales the previous Christmas.<br/><br/>Design Features<br/><br/>Previous game consoles sometimes had a difficult time replicating the arcade experience in home versions of popular arcade games. In particular, home versions of arcade games sometimes had problems with flickering and slow down when more than a few moving objects appeared on the screen at once. GCC, designers of the 7800, had a background in creating arcade games. They designed the new system with a graphical architecture similar to arcade machines of the time.<br/><br/>The 7800 featured the ability to move around a tremendous amount of objects (75-to-100) that far exceeded previous consoles. Powering the system was an Atari SALLY 6502 (Atari's slightly custom 6502, sometimes described as a &quot;6502C&quot;) processor running at 1.79 MHz.<br/><br/>To address the concerns of parents that home computers were a better investment than consoles, the system was designed to be upgraded to a full-fledged home computer. On the side of the 7800 was an expansion port, reportedly for a planned connection with a laserdisc player.<br/><br/>Technical Specifications<br/><br/><br/>     CPU: Atari SALLY 6502 (&quot;6502C&quot;), Speed: 1.79 MHz, drops to 1.19 MHz when the TIA Television Interface Adaptor or RIOT (6532 RAM-I/O-Timer) chips are accessed (note: Unlike a standard 6502, SALLY can be halted to allow other devices to control the bus)<br/>     RAM: 4 KB (2 6116 2Kx8 RAM ICs)<br/>     ROM: built in 4 KB BIOS ROM, 48 KB Cartridge ROM space without bankswitching<br/>     Graphics: MARIA custom graphics controller, 160&times;240 (160&times;288 PAL) resolution or 320&times;240/288 resolution, 25 color palette out of 256 colors (16 hues * 16 luma), different graphics modes restricted the number of usable colors and the number of colors per sprite, Direct Memory Access (DMA), Graphics clock: 7.16 MHz<br/>     I/O: Joystick and console switch IO handled byte 6532 RIOT and TIA<br/>     Ports: 2 joystick ports, 1 cartridge port, 1 expansion connector, power in, RF output<br/>     Sound: TIA video and sound chip, same as the 2600.

The player competes against two other human or AI dragon-raising alchemists that have the same goal.<br/><br/>The three pieces of the talisman are hidden in towns and villages represented on a map. Consequently, the main missions the player sends her or his dragons on are missions of conquering and pillaging, both for the long-term goal of locating the pieces of the talisman, and for the more immediate goal of gaining income in the form of taxes or loot from the local populace.  Dragons will also engage in dragon-on-dragon combat when they encounter enemy dragons in the larger world, and such combats can be purposefully sought out, in order to undermine enemy alchemists' plans.  Combat can be handled automatically by the computer or played out by human players.  Missions are given to dragons on each players' turn (each turn being one month), and then are all resolved simutaneously when the dragons carry out their orders.<br/><br/>A central feature of the game is its complicated alchemy system.  Various alchemical formulas, all of which contain ingredients that must be purchased, can be used to affect dragons in a wide range of ways, including boosting their speed, strength, intelligence, health, and eyesight (useful for locating talismans).  A range of other game factors can also be affected by alchemy.  However, alchemy formulas have detrimental as well as positive effects, so by boosting a dragon's strength, one may at the same time decrease it's eyesight.  Usually there is a meaningful net gain to using an alchemical formula, but the general idea is that proper use of alchemy requires some experimentation and skill.<br/><br/>"}, "110850": {"rpgdesigner": ["Miguel de Luis"], "rpgitemversion": ["Initial PDF Version", "Precis Intermedia PDF"], "statistics": [], "name": "Newsies & Bootblacks", "rpgartist": ["Fromoldbooks.org", "Lewis Hines", "J.

Except for Ice Scream all of the levels were based on episodes of the show. Rocko's goal in every level is to keep Spunky safe from danger.

It claims to be the first American-developed game for the SNES system.<br/><br/>RPM was one of the first SNES games developed in 'High Resolution Graphics Mode' which allowed for sharper detail but fewer colors. While the higher resolution gave finer detail, it also severely limited the number of colors and amount of unique graphics that could be displayed from the SNES video memory. Due to this, the sequel to RPM (RPMII which was later renamed Rock N' Roll Racing) was developed in the lower resolution graphics mode allowing for much more vibrant colors and graphic detail.<br/><br/>The logic engine and track editor for RPM were ported from an older EA title Racing Destruction Set. The 6502 assembly code was modified for 16-bit but otherwise mostly left intact.<br/><br/>There is an easter egg in the game on Track 29 which spells 'Eat Me' very clearly. This surprisingly made it through Nintendo's QA process and wasn't mentioned in any of the post reviews of the game.<br/><br/>In the game, players can race in a regular season, a single race, and even get to create their own course. The courses can be straight and oval like NASCAR, curvy and flat like Formula One, or hilly and unpredictable like a monster truck track. The winner gets money and a chance to score his initials for the fastest time.<br/><br/>RPM was developed using the 'Sluggo' development system created by Bill Heineman and his partner which allowed uploading of bin files to a device that emulated a cartridge for the SNES. System did not include step through or trace functionality.<br/><br/>RPM was programmed in 65816 Assembly Language using a cross compiler on an IBM computer.<br/><br/>Development took five months and was programmed almost exclusively by Allen Adham with graphics supplied by Interplay and in-house 3D modellers.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;RPM Racing&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "110905": {"rpgdesigner": ["Eli Atkinson", "William Church", "Serge W.

The allied leaders were in disagreement on what the next step should be; invade Italy, the Balkans, or France. Stalin was desperate to open another front in Europe. Churchill wanted to invade Italy which he labeled &ldquo;the soft underbelly of the Axis&rdquo;. It was agreed that since no invasion of Northern France could be undertaken in 1943, that the invasion of Sicily would take place. The allied commanders were sure that invading Italy would all but destroy the Italians will to fight, and maybe the government and Mussolini would be overthrown.<br/><br/>The German high command was also aware that Italy&rsquo;s support for the war was dwindling. German units that were needed for the Eastern front were sent to Italy to help defend against an allied attack and to police the Italian army in case of a coup. With most of Germany&rsquo;s army and supplies on the Eastern front and a weakening ally in Italy, Germany is desperate to keep the allies out of Southern Europe.<br/><br/>The Invasion of Italy is an Axis &amp; Allies style game that puts you in the seat of the Axis commanders who are racing to get their army into a position to defend Southern Europe, and Allied commanders who are ready to open another front in Europe to relieve the Russians on the Eastern front. Will you follow history as the allies and invade Sicily and then Italy, or will you try to take Rome first and severe the Axis army in Europe?

The other player controls the Allies who have 20 turns to take as many victory cities as possible before the Germans can reinforce Italy.

From the time it was discovered, our minds focused on using fire in a number of ways. Beyond the apparent applications of cooking our food and keeping warm at night, fire has captured our imaginations. We have applied fire, and heat by extension, to the display of strong emotions with descriptions like &ldquo;hot-headed&rdquo;, &ldquo;hot under the collar&rdquo;, being in a &ldquo;heated argument&rdquo;, and &ldquo;getting steamed&rdquo;. It became incorporated into our stories and legends with monstrous creatures like fire-breathing dragons who horde vast amounts of treasured goods and threaten our very survival, demons who reside in a flaming underworld, bent on causing the downfall of even the most saintly of people, and gods who control such powerful elements of nature that they can cause even the most dormant of volcanoes to erupt and rain lava down upon us.<br/><br/>With the idea of fire having such a huge impact on our lives, transporting it into a roleplaying game is a natural step. Many of the monsters from our myths and legends have a logical place in a fantasy setting, fueling the very adventures that our heroes undertake on a regular basis. Additionally, it is not uncommon for fantasy settings to incorporate an entire separate plane of existence filled with pure fire, which hosts a myriad of creatures that live and thrive in this most hostile of environments. Fire can be conjured, shaped, and wielded by heroes and villains alike, with wizards, sorcerers, and druids summoning fire to vanquish their enemies. Blacksmiths use large amounts of heat to forge the very weapons and armor that many of our heroes use to fight and rid the lands of evil.<br/><br/>As a small offer in that regard, The Genius Guide to Races of Fire and Fury presents a trio of new fantasy races&mdash;the rakonar, sila, and votanan&mdash;suitable for use as player characters or NPCs. These races share a common trait of having some association with fire and heat. They all come from remote&mdash;some might even say exotic&mdash;locales, making the possibility of encountering them a rarity in almost any world (and making them easier to incorporate into existing campaigns).<br/><br/>Of course, it takes more than just a few cosmetic peculiarities to make a creature feel truly fantastic. Like elves, dwarves, and the other classic character races, each of the new races comes from a culture with its own unique perspective on life and their place in the world&mdash;a set of cultural norms that GMs and players can use to understand how the group would fit into a campaign and build characters that fit within (or purposely stretch themselves beyond) those expectations.<br/><br/>Like any good rules expansion, The Genius Guide to Races of Fire and Fury is meant to introduce new possibilities to your campaign and give everyone at the table a chance to expand the horizons of the game and create adventures that are truly fantastic.<br/><br/>"}, "110953": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Rob Judy"], "poll": [], "name": "Bassin' Patterns", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Paper-and-Pencil", "Pattern Recognition", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Simulation"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Fishing / Angling"], "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1122892_t.jpg", "average": "6.9", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1122892.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Dice", "Real-time", "Sports"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "In this game, players alternate taking the role of the fish, and the other try to find the optimum pattern to catch him.

One player plays the Clowns: their goal is to abduct the remaining humans and force them into the Circus.  All the other players play Survivors, who roam the blasted wastes in a pitiful search for food, salvageable material, and safety... and who try to take out as many Clowns as possible along the way.<br/><br/>In Clownpocalypse, each player playing a human Survivor leads a Team.  At the start of the game your Team is just a single Survivor, but a big part of the game is rescuing other Survivors and attempting to lead them to safety. Each Survivor you shepherd to safety at game's end is worth a victory point, but having a large Team during the course of gameplay can create problems: the larger your Team, the more attention they attract from the Clowns.<br/><br/>It also gets tougher to feed them. In classic survival horror fashion, you start the game with only a limited number of Rations, and you'll need to use your quickly dwindling supply to feed each member of your Team every turn.  If your Team gets too large too fast, you're going to have trouble, and then you're going to need to do a hard moral calculus: do you let someone starve? Do you cannibalize your own Team? (Each of these choices has their own pros and cons.)<br/><br/>After you've fed your Team, you get the option to Travel. Traveling is the main way you move through the game deck, uncovering resources and, eventually, the Way Out.  There will always be three cards in the gameplay area displaying three possible resources to Travel to.  Those resources could be Locations, Rations, Salvage, Weapons, or other Survivors, and part of your strategic thinking in the game will involve assessing which resources your Team really needs--you can only attempt to get one per turn, leaving the rest on the table for your rivals.<br/><br/>And of course, there's danger.  The Clowns want to stop you from reaching those resources. So, each turn, the player playing the Clowns places one Clown card, face down, in front of each resource on the table.  This is where the game becomes a battle of wits.  The Clowns have some cards that are stronger than others, and so they need to carefully choose where they place their best cards.  Which resource on the table is the most valuable to the player whose turn it is?  Is that the one that the Clowns should defend the strongest?  Or should they bluff, placing a weaker Clown there in the event that the player decides to grab up a lesser resource, in the hope of avoiding confrontation?  Being able to predict your opponent's strategic choices is an important part of this game.<br/><br/>Once you've declared what resource you're travelling to (or opted to stay put, which has its own risks), the Clowns flip the card they uses to defend that resource, and a confrontation ensues.<br/><br/>Clownpocalypse contains 64 cards (Clowns, Survivors, Weapons, Salvage, and Locations), a set of counters to represent Rations, plus some other goodies in an attractive, sturdy box.  Clownpocalypse is hilarious, disturbing, challenging, and rewarding: you're going to love it.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "age": "0", "name": "Clownpocalypse", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Chit-Pull System", "Hand Management", "Set Collection", "Variable Player Powers"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Circus", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "110957": {"rpgdesigner": ["Wolfgang Baur", "Stefen Styrsky"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Divine Favor: the Inquisitor", "rpgartist": ["Christophe Swal"], "rpgproducer": ["Wolfgang Baur", "Miranda Horner", "Timothy K.

All of whom are tied together by the code and honour amongst pirates.<br/>Both code and honour will be betrayed multiple times as the players plot and make mischief for and against each other. One adventure takes approximately one to two hours, including all preparations and planning, such as shuffling the cards, creating characters and making up the premise. The game is playable with just the cards, but you might find the game easier to follow if you use paper to make notes and count the crosses in the Davy Jones Counter. The game is all about having fun. Push your characters into complicated and fun situations. Curse like a scallywag. Cheat fate, act like a legend, and if the inevitable cold grave calls you - go with a bang.<br/><br/>Each player has a character. After creating the characters, you may use the cards and the adventure-o-matic to create a grand,<br/>challenging adventure. All scenes start from a plot twist. The twists might be positive, helpful, funny or they might come in the shape of a challenge. Players respond to challenges by using cards from their hand. A player may play as many cards of the same suit as he likes, but the sum of their values must be at least equal to the challenge card&rsquo;s value in order to beat the challenge. If the character is unable to resolve a challenge with the cards in hand, the situation might call for a betrayal. A challenge from another character&rsquo;s action can kill a character, if the challenge winning player calls for it. However, challenges between characters do not need to be deadly: a character might try to seduce another or steal his hat.<br/><br/>Pirates never betray each other, or the pirate code, Well... at least if it&rsquo;s not a matter of life and death ... Or if it&rsquo;s not about love ... Or if there is no gold in it ... Or&hellip; well, you get the picture. A player calls for a betrayal, and asks for a suit. Even if the characters cannot die directly from the challenges, there is a price for failure and betrayal. Sooner or later the cold arms of the grave will welcome all pirates of the sea. There should be 12 empty slots in each character sheet. These slots are used to keep score of the character&rsquo;s failures and betrayals. Each time the character fails a challenge, two X&rsquo;s are added to the counter.<br/>Each time the character betrays the others, one X is added to the counter.<br/><br/>And each time the character gets one or more X&rsquo;s - a card is drawn. If the value of the card is equal or less than the number of X&rsquo;s on the character sheet, the character&rsquo;s days are numbered and he is doomed.If a character already has 12 X&rsquo;s on the sheet, he is immediately doomed, when he gets the 13th mark.<br/>A doomed character will die in any of the next three scenes. Players should not feel too attached to a doomed character. He might look pale or even ghostly or see omens of his death for he knows that the day is his last.<br/><br/>When and how does the game end?<br/>The game should end if<br/>&bull; Adventure has reached its conclusion,<br/>&bull; You reach agreed time limit (Professional pirates recommend using 2 hour time limit)<br/>&bull; Players are too tired (of drinking Rum) to play on.<br/><br/>"}, "110962": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1125733.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Joseph Murray"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Christian Quinot"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Black Tea Studios"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1125733_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Fantasy"], "description": "Overview<br/>Shadow Days is a new and exciting fantasy deckbuilding, combat, and survival game from Black Tea Studios.

If that happens, everyone loses.<br/><br/><br/>    OccupyBoardwalk is an Uncooperative Game for 3 or More Players. It just requires a copy of Monopoly and a book. (It can be any book, but we suggest Das Capital, Road to Serfdom or a pocket copy of the Constitution).  <br/><br/><br/>Each round, the public expects the 1% to pay another 1000 dollars of your fortunes towards the public good. To do this, the player with the Top Hat opens the book to a page an puts any amount of money into the book secretly. They then flip to another page and pass the book to the next player. When a player gets the book, they can&rsquo;t flip backwards in the book to see what other players have payed. Once each player has had an opportunity to put money into the book, the first player turns the book over and shakes it over the board. Collect the money that falls out, count it and put it under public parking.<br/><br/>Remember two things: The player with the most money left at the end of the game wins. Also, the public expects the 1% to pay another $1000 every turn. So the expectations of the public about the amount of money in public parking increases every turn. There are a few other twists and turns involving the removal of protestors from properties, and the use of Chance and Community Chest cards to get bailed out when things get rough.

The Menacer is made up of three interconnected sections. The main section alone can be used as a pistol. A skeletonized shoulder stock can be added for extra support. The third removable section are twin sights that are clipped on to the top of the barrel. The twin sights were impractical, as one could not effectively see what one was shooting at.<br/><br/>The Menacer is powered by 6 AAA batteries and was not connected by a wire to the console but by an infrared beam that relays signals to a receiver box that would ideally sit on top of the television. The receiver box has to be plugged into the console in the second controller port. The Menacer was advertised as the most accurate light gun ever. The Menacer retailed for $100 in North America.<br/><br/>The Menacer came with an exclusive 6-game cartridge of mostly target shooting games. The games included on the cartridge are: Pest Control, Space Station Defender, Whack Ball, Front Line, Rockman's Zone, and Ready, Aim Tomatoes! -- the latter stars Sega franchise characters ToeJam and Earl. While most games utilize the light gun as a means to shoot down objects, Whack Ball actually utilized the Menacer as a mouse of sorts. All 6 of the games were conceptualized by Mac Senour, Producer on both the hardware and software. The Menacer works fully with the Sega Mega-CD, even though that system had, with the Konami Justifier, two different light guns developed for it.<br/><br/>Since the Menacer uses scan lines to determine where the user is aiming, it will only work with CRT based television sets. It also won't work with frame grabber cards or TV tuners that redirect the output to a computer screen.<br/><br/>Sega and third-party developers did not develop many games for the Menacer. The only compatible Mega Drive games were the 6-game cartridge, Body Count, and T2: The Arcade Game.
