The name is derived from the German words Beil (axe) and Tod (death). The odd spelling reflects Goodman's idea of a future language similar to A Clockwork Orange's Nadsat in which English has been modified by the borrowing of foreign words. Although the game may seem medieval, the backstory in the manual explains that the axe fighting is actually a future virtual reality game designed to reduce real violence.<br/><br/>The Bilestoad allows a human player to fight against either a computer-controlled opponent or another human. One can also pit two robots against each other. Movement and combat is accomplished with the keyboard, pressing keys to swing the gladiator's axe or shield outwards or inwards, or to make the gladiator turn, stop or walk. The game play is quite violent and bloody&mdash;players lop off their opponents' shield or sword arms, and dispatch them by decapitation.<br/><br/>The arena of combat is a small island, maps of which (at short, medium, and long range) are shown at the right side of the screen. Scattered around the arena are various objects, including yin/yang discs which players can stand on to accelerate their movement, stars that transport players to other points in the arena, and &quot;faces&quot; that allow players to leave the level. The game offers more strategic variation than many fighting games, letting the player run away and be chased around the island. The musical soundtrack begins with a bizarre, ponderous, off-key re-working of Beethoven's &quot;F&uuml;r Elise&quot;.<br/><br/>According to the author, influences for The Bilestoad include the movie Excalibur and Monty Python and the Holy Grail.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The Bilestoad&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "119014": {"videogame": {"118157": "Uncharted 2: Among Thieves Game of the Year Edition"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Uncharted Dual Pack", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"150123": "North American PlayStation 3 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1237807.jpg", "videogameseries": {"4893": "Uncharted"}, "videogametheme": {"2329": "Folklore"}, "videogamefranchise": {"6404": "Greatest Hits (Best Selling PlayStation Games, US)"}, "average": "9.2", "videogamegenre": {"2161": "Action Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4435": "PlayStation 3"}, "usersrated": "5", "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"118157": "Uncharted 2: Among Thieves Game of the Year Edition"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1237807_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Uncharted Greatest Hits Combo pack includes<br/> - Uncharted: Drakes Fortune Greatest Hits edition<br/> - Uncharted 2: Among Thieves Game of the Year edition<br/><br/>Also included is a Souper Voucher to redeem DLC bonus material for both Uncharted 2 and Uncharted 3.<br/><br/>"}, "119015": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Kujibiki Unbalance: Kaicho Onegai Smash Fight", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"150124": "Japanese PlayStation 2 edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2494": "Romance / Relationships"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Kujibiki Unbalance: Kaich\u014d Onegai Smash Fight is based on the 2006 anime series of Kujibiki Unbalance.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Kujibiki Unbalance: Kaicho Onegai Smash Fight&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>Kujibiki&hearts;Unbalance (\u304f\u3058\u3073\u304d&hearts;\u30a2\u30f3\u30d0\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9 Kujibiki&hearts;Anbaransu), also referred to as Kujibiki &quot;Heart&quot; Unbalance in order to differentiate it from its original incarnation, is a 12-episode Fall 2006 anime series created by Shimoku Kio.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Kujibiki Unbalance (2006 series)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>In this relationship/adventure game, your 'liked' level determines how well you do in battle as much as the two girl allies you choose.

TIME WARP:  If a player plays a new sequence which contains one tile of each color (red, blue, and yellow), all opponents draw one random tile from the cloth bag.<br/><br/>After their opening turn, players may add new tiles to the front or end of an existing sequence (including another player's sequence), as long as the spacing already established for that sequence is followed.  Players may also insert two or more new tiles inside an existing sequence, altering the spacing to a new value between tiles.<br/><br/>Players play as many tiles as possible on their turn, and if they can't play at least one tile they must draw one from the cloth bag.  The first player to place all their tiles wins!<br/><br/>WHAT THEY'LL LEARN: Sequencing, Patterning<br/><br/>"}, "119072": {"boardgamedesigner": {"14": {"name": "Richard Garfield"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Let's Drive", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2078": "Point to Point Movement"}, "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1286129_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"11478": "Alvin Madden"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3491": {"name": "SimplyFun"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1286129.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"150233": "SimplyFun Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1011": {"name": "Transportation"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Time to hit the open road!

What is the sinister truth behind these violent acts?<br/><br/>Dawn of the Scarlet Sun is a Pathfinder RPG adventure for six 5th-level characters&mdash;such as the six iconic heroes provided. In addition, this adventure can be integrated into the Shattered Star Pathfinder Adventure Path, and uses the villains featured in the Pathfinder Battles Champions of Evil Encounter Pack.<br/><br/>This special 16-page Pathfinder Module will initially be made available for Free RPG Day on June 16, 2012.

A FREE PDF will also be available on that date.<br/><br/>From the back of the book<br/><br/>A murderer stalks the streets of Magnimar!  The guards are baffled, people huddle in their homes, and whispers spread of the death delivered on dark wings.  Desperate for aid, the city watch turns to bold adventurers, revealing more of the murders' gruesome details and bringing the heroes in on a daring plan to catch the killer - a plot that makes them a tempting target for the maniac's bloody knife.  This dangerous ploy sets the heroes on a path fraught with savage creatures, decades-old secrets, and the dark desires of an immortal evil that seeks to pervert a forgotten house of worship.  Will they be able to put an end to the slaughter?  Or will all of Magnimar drown in the rising tide of blood?<br/><br/>Dawn of the Scarlet Sun is an adventure for 5th-level characters, written for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and compatible with the 35 edition of the world's oldest RPG.<br/><br/>"}, "119117": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Envoyer (Issue 115 - May 2006)", "rpgproducer": {"57708": "Thomas Echelmeyer"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1226594.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"5242": "Envoyer"}, "rpg": {"640": "Bushido"}, "rpgissueversion": {"150324": "Softcover"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1226594_t.jpg", "description": "This issue contains the second part of the Cthulhu adventure &quot;Familienfluch&quot; and one short adventure for L5R, Oriental Adventures or Bushido &quot;Der letzte Aramasu&quot; and one short adventure for shadowrun &quot;Musashis Schwert&quot; and one bigger advneture for shadowrun &quot;Westworld&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "119118": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Envoyer (Issue 116 - Jun 2006)", "rpgproducer": {"57708": "Thomas Echelmeyer"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1830123.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"5242": "Envoyer"}, "rpg": {"310": "Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"150326": "Softcover"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1830123_t.png", "description": "This issue contains one big DSA adventure &quot;XIII&quot;, one small adventure &quot;Feier mit Hindernissen&quot; and two short adventures &quot;Heiliger Strohsack&quot; &amp; &quot;Seelenverwandschaft&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "119119": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Mutant Mudds", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"192524": "iPhone/iPad edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1562088.png", "videogametheme": {"2658": "Aliens"}, "usersrated": "8", "average": "7.5", "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"6826": "iPad"}, "videogamehonor": {"34405": "2012 Operation Rainfall Awards Best Download Only Game of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1562088_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A meteor has hit Earth and the Mutant Mudd aliens are trying to take over the world.

Although practically the same as the 2002 version, this contains some differences in the in-match play, and is famed for wingers cutting inside to shoot from ridiculous angles, and goalkeepers who tend to tip shots just inside the far post, making this an often frustrating game. There are also a few mistakes on the game, such as Birmingham City's Bryan Hughes being 29, instead of his proper age at the time, which was 24.

Here are the different types of cards in the game:<br/><br/><br/>    Green-backed cards = These cards give special responsibilities to the player who holds Agent P or Dr. Doofenshmirtz. For example &quot;Say 'Ahh, Perry the Platypus!' before you start your turn. If you forget, you turn is over!&quot; These cards also give the indicated player an extra penalty or bonus. For example &quot;You may play 1 extra card.&quot; A new green-backed card is flipped over and takes effect whenever the Agent P or Dr. Doofenshmirtz character moves to another player.<br/>    Blue-backed Character Cards = These cards move the characters around. For instance &quot;Take 1 character from another player.&quot;<br/>    Blue-backed Power Cards = These cards give you special card-play powers. For instance &quot;Take 1 random card from each player.&quot;<br/>    Blue-backed Challenge Cards = These cards allow you to do weird challenges against other players. For instance &quot;Challenge another player to a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. If you win, take up to 3 random cards from the other player.<br/>    Blue-backed Scene Cards = These cards are how you score points. If you have the character(s) shown on the card you can play it for the number of points indicated on the card. For instance the &quot;Unfair Science Fair&quot; card is worth 10 points if you currently hold Baljeet.<br/>    Blue-backed Special Cards = The Mom card forces everyone to discard everything and draw 3 new cards.

It was introduced alongside the PlayStation 3 in 2006 and remained the console's official controller until 2008. The Sixaxis was succeeded by the DualShock 3, an updated version of the controller that, like the DualShock and DualShock 2 controllers, incorporates haptic technology &ndash; also known as force feedback. A Sixaxis controller can also be used with Sony's PSP Go via Bluetooth after registering the controller on a PlayStation 3 console.<br/><br/>The DualShock 3 was originally intended to be bundled with the PlayStation 3 in time for the console's launch. However, Sony was in the midst of appealing a decision from a 2004 lawsuit involving patent infringement claimed by Immersion. The two companies were at odds over the haptic feedback technology used in earlier PlayStation controllers. The legal battle led to a decision to remove the vibration capabilities from the PS3 controller's initial design, which became known as Sixaxis.<br/><br/>The term &quot;sixaxis&quot; is also used to refer to the motion-sensing technology in PlayStation 3 controllers. It is a contraction of &quot;six axis&quot;, which refers to the ability to sense motion in all axes of the six degrees of freedom. The term is also a palindrome.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Sixaxis,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>The Sixaxis wireless controller was originally released with earlier versions of the PS3. The Sixaxis was replaced by the DualShock 3 which is nearly identical but adds the haptic feedback &ndash; also known as force feedback (&quot;rumble&quot; feature) that the Sixaxis lacked.<br/><br/>"}, "119218": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Xor", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"158123": "English/European Amstrad CPC Cassette edition"}, "average": "7.75", "videogametheme": {"2351": "Puzzle"}, "usersrated": "2", "videogamegenre": {"2407": "Maze"}, "videogameplatform": {"5203": "Amstrad CPC"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>In this game, the player controls two shield-like characters, Magus and Questor, and must negotiate 15 levels of the game to escape.

Through their continued growth and expansion they have discovered many ancient ruins of a time long past.  It was within one such set of these ruins that an expedition of explorers from Kazdim uncovered, and released, an unspeakable horror.  A dread so unimaginable the ancients themselves imprisoned it over a thousand years ago.  This evil has a name... Necrath, The Ice Duke.<br/><br/>In the decade and a half that has passed since this wicked scourge was loosed upon the land, strange, dark, and violent events have taken place.  Sinister books and scrolls of vile evil and black magic have been discovered, and have twisted the minds of those foolish enough to read them.  Raiding parties of wittershin have set out from the mountains to wreak havoc and destruction upon men.  These assaults were followed by a full scale war led by the mighty race of rephaim, from whom the conflict was so named, the War of the Giants.<br/><br/>It has been seven years since the War of the Giants ended, and the nations of men have slowly been recovering from their staggering losses.  A keep has been constructed to maintain vigil over the mountain pass, should the enemy ever decide to rear its ugly head again.  All would appear to be calm, for now. But appearances are deceiving, for deep within the mountains that same evil so recently released is stirring yet again.<br/><br/>Illfrost: Bondage represents the first step into the Illfrost Adventure Path, which will ultimately span 30 levels.  This adventure is designed for five 1st-Level PCs, and will quickly introduce them to this unique and harsh campaign setting by starting them off as slaves.<br/><br/>Illfrost: Bondage is a 4th Edition compatible Heroic First Level Adventure Path Module from Illusionary Press that will have your players chilled to the bone, not only by its brutal environment, but also by its perilous challenges and unimaginable horrors.<br/><br/>Illfrost: Bondage is based in the world of Illfrost created by Don Pritchett, but easily adaptable to your own campaign setting.

A pandemic is sweeping the globe. At first, scientists believe it to be yet another wave of the Spanish Flu. In the disease&rsquo;s early stages, patients present with high fever, vomiting, and weakness. Quickly, the Spanish Flu theory comes under scrutiny. Patients all report having been attacked. Where the disease spreads violent crime seems to inexplicably rise. As outbreaks skyrocket, several studies conclusively prove the disease in not the dreaded Spanish Flu; it is something much worse. Late stage symptoms are found to include death, reanimation, superhuman strength, and an insatiable craving for human flesh.<br/><br/>After precious few years of peace, the nations of the world are returning once more to the trenches, united against a common foe. In Zombies &amp; Zeppelins, 2-4 players lead the forces of humanity against hordes of the undead. Together, players must attempt to clear the numerous infested cities around the world. Should they fail, mankind will be swept away in a tide of the damned.<br/><br/>Zombies &amp; Zeppelins is played on a game board depicting a map of the world which has been divided into 25 regions. The game uses a card-driven system to determine both the spread of the undead and humanity's military capacity. Player's must carefully manage their meager resources in combating the undead.

It is a spin-off to the Clock Tower series and has almost nothing to do with the previous games besides its gameplay.<br/><br/>Following its predecessors, the gameplay is more about hiding and solving puzzles, rather than fighting the player's pursuers. This degenerates as the plot advances, and the main character is eventually forced to use guns and other tools in several endgame action sequences.<br/><br/>Its interface consists of a point-and-click system similar to the one used by Sierra Entertainment games, such as the Gabriel Knight series. There is an inventory screen that appears if the user drags the pointer to the upper side of the screen. The game's engine looks similar to Clock Tower 2 (Clock Tower in North America), with a few minor alterations.<br/><br/>Clock Tower Ghost Head features three chapters whose length can change depending on the choices made by the player. The game's replay value comes mostly in its 13 endings, which normally portray the main character dying in different violent ways. The paths to each separate ending can be confusing and difficult to follow accurately and, as such, many players utilize walkthroughs in order to achieve them.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Clock Tower II: The Struggle Within&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "119348": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1680279.png", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"35330": {"name": "David Gregg"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"12177": "Richard Kitner, Jr."}, "boardgamepublisher": {"396": {"name": "Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG)"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1680279_t.png", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "<br/>            Publisher blurb to be added here***<br/>        <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Destiny Collins knows how to recruit the help you need.

However there were uprisings and armies in conflict in Eastern Europe, especially in the newly created Duchy of Warsaw.<br/>La Bataille de Raszyn depicts the major battle between the VII Austrian Armeekorps and the Polish Forces defending Warsaw. The invasion force commanded by Archduke Ferdinand d&rsquo;Este drives toward the capital of Poland being defended by General Poniatowski.  Poniatowski decides to defend a crucial river crossing that has limited crossings and swampy ground.<br/><br/>The forces of Poniatowski are limited as much of the Polish forces are fighting in Spain. His available forces have excellent morale being highly motivated to defend a country once partitioned by Austrian, Prussia and Russia. A contingent of Saxons assist the Polish Army and scenarios add a variety of forces from neighboring areas.<br/><br/>D&rsquo; Este &lsquo;Austrian&rsquo; Army is in fact made up of infantry from Hungary and Galician (Poland), with Grenz (border) troops and a sizable number of elite cavalry. Although this army outnumbers the forces of Poniatowski, it may lack the motivation and leadership of their counterpoints. The Austrian Army&rsquo;s tactics include some of the recent reforms and traditional formations. Option rules and scenarios provide for a number of &lsquo;what ifs&rdquo; and fresh simulations<br/><br/>Each 20 minute turn starts with a Command Phase for both sides followed by the French Player sequence and then by the Prussian Player sequence. The sequence includes movement, cavalry charges, fire and melee. During each, morale plays a decisive role. This is a great one player on one player game that can be completed in an afternoon. In addition to the historical game there are two scenarios that vary the orders of battle and appearance times.<br/>The original rules have been updated but not expanded to any extent. The original designers of the La Bataille Series believe the Premier Rules facilitate the most accurate and competitive play.

The players represent the heads of Florentine families trying to rise their families to power. To achieve this, they send out their family members to locations in Tuscany to perform various tasks, specifically to recruit followers (knights, assassins, abbots) and collect money as both are needed to take control of provinces in neighboring regions; controlled provinces provide power and a bonus action. Another task is to gain the favor of the squirearchy as these favors are indispensable when it comes to getting an official position in Florence, e.g., a seat on the town council to enhance actions in Tuscany, or a noble rank to gain power at the end of the game.<br/><br/>To complete these tasks, however, a proper middleman must be present at a location, and as these middlemen travel a lot, they are rarely met. That's why it is so important to have one's family members in the right place at the right time &ndash; to save on time and money while achieving one's goals.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player has four family members in Tuscany. Players take turns performing exactly one action. Before his action, a player may pay money to move one of his own family members to another location. The available actions are to:<br/><br/><br/>    Take a location-specific action in Tuscany. This requires both a middleman and one of your own standing (active) family members at that location. After the action, this family member is laid down (inactive).<br/>    Travel to another region and take over a province, which costs both followers and money.<br/>    Travel to Florence where you'll spend scrolls (and possibly money) to claim a city council or nobility tile.<br/>    Introduce a new family member to the board.<br/>    Raise all lying family members on the board.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends when the &quot;Power of the Medici&quot; has faded, as indicated by a diminishing pile of crest tiles. Certain actions require you to remove such a tile, and the game ends when they're all gone. Players then sum their power points &ndash; earned for gained tiles and majorities in the regions and Florence &ndash; for a final scoring, and the player with the most power wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"193617": "English first edition"}, "average": "6.96551", "name": "Il Vecchio", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "10", "usersrated": "1240", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"18646": "Cities: Florence"}}, "119393": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Fantasywelt (Issue 23 - 1989)", "rpgproducer": {"25837": "Uwe K\u00f6rner"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1223950.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"5239": "Fantasywelt"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"74490": "Drago Comic"}, "rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpgissueversion": {"151156": "Softcover"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1223950_t.jpg", "description": "This issue contains 3 short adventures &quot;Die Statuette&quot;, &quot;Crime-Story&quot; &amp; &quot;Das Rennen&quot;.<br/><br/>the published year is not proven<br/><br/>---<br/>user summary<br/><br/>"}, "119394": {"boardgamedesigner": {"19506": {"name": "Kevin Kulp (I)"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Twisted Tails", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"17452": "Global Game Jam"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1232470_t.png", "boardgameartist": {"26997": "Jason Tagmire"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1232470.png", "boardgameversion": {"151157": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Each player places snake pieces on the board, either continuing an existing snake, or ending one to start another.

In the game, the Eds run the risk of having their scams turned on them by the other kids in the neighborhood. Many of the objects and characters, as well as the visual style, borrow heavily from the cartoon.<br/><br/>Each Ed has his own set of levels to complete. They're all side-scrolling fare, but each Ed has his own style of movement and attacks. Edd throws dictionaries, Ed slams his head down on the enemies, while Eddy spits his gum at enemies (Although this freezes the enemy, it does not defeat them). Item pick-ups can be activated on the touch-screen.<br/>On top of the platforming elements, the game contains a number of unlockable mini-games: Whack-a-Mole has been turned into &quot;Whack a Zit&quot; where players tap at rising pimples on Ed's back before they burst. There's also a pie-throwing challenge where players flick the desserts up at enemies on the top screen.[2] The game features 13 total stages, special attacks using the touch screen, the option to blow into the microphone to bring characters back to life, three side story mini-games and special items.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy: Scam of the Century&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "119427": {"statistics": {}, "name": "High School Musical: Livin' the Dream", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"151231": "North American Game Boy Advance edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2510": "Dancing"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4423": "Game Boy Advance"}, "poll": {}, "description": "High School Musical : Livin' The Dream is a video game based on the 2006 and 2007 television movies High School Musical and High School Musical 2 available for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance.<br/>[edit]Gameplay<br/><br/>The game features two modes: Story and Quick Play.

Games in these categories are relatively rare (Tablan, Puluc, and Daldos being virtually the only other known examples).<br/><br/>The game is played on a board with 4 rows and anywhere from 7 to 15 columns.  One player fills the bottom row with playing pieces; the other player fills the top row with his or her pieces.  Four casting sticks are used to randomly generate moves for the pieces.  The two center rows of the board are treated as a looping track along which pieces move linearly in a counter-clockwise direction once leaving their home row. It is primarily on these two central rows that the battles take place, with a piece capturing an opponent piece by landing on its square.  A few special movement rules add complexity and strategy to the game.  A player wins by capturing all of the opponent's pieces.<br/><br/>There is some speculation among game historians that T&acirc;b may be a descendent of the ancient Egyptian game of Senet (similarities include linear movement and the use of casting sticks).<br/><br/>"}, "119437": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1223270.png", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"10138": {"name": "Justin Gary"}}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamecompilation": {"180616": "Ascension: Year Two Collector's Edition"}, "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"40031": "Eric Sabee"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"157": {"name": "Asmodee"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1223270_t.png", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Ring of Life is a promo card that will be given out to players that show up to game day locations in February and will likely be made available for sale on the Ascension website at a later date.<br/><br/>From the Card:<br/><br/>Ring of Life<br/>Cost: 4 Runes to acquire<br/>Lifebound Construct<br/>Once per turn, if you have played a Lifebound Hero, gain one Rune.<br/>When Ring of Life enters play, choose a faction.

Introducing ACQUAINT&trade; - the revolutionary &quot;real deal&quot; card game that helps first-, second-, or even third-time daters get better acquainted. It was designed not only to create conversation and calm nerves, but to also help daters better determine each other's &quot;keeper&quot; potentials; needless to say, finding out early on whether or not they are truly compatible may prove to be a time-saving, preventative measure of future heartache.<br/><br/>This highly interactive card game includes questions, tasks, lessons and more! It encourages 'authentic' conversation through the sharing of thoughts, experiences, feelings and values. Questions range from light-hearted topics to semi-personal and serious, and fun &quot;off-the-wall&quot; topics are included throughout.<br/><br/>OBJECT: Collect as many Rose Cards in your hand as you can by discarding as many other cards as possible. Players perform any task(s) listed on the discarded card on each turn. There are a total of 9 Rose Cards, and the player with the most in their hand at the end wins. The main point of the game, however, is for the players to get to know one another better.<br/><br/>CARDS: Includes 52 cards total <br/><br/>     9 ROSE CARDS<br/>     20 'REAL DEAL' QUESTION CARDS <br/>     4 FILL-IN-THE-BLANK CARDS<br/>     6 DISCUSSION CARDS<br/>     5 SCALE (&quot;What # Are You?&quot;) CARDS<br/>     6 MISCELLANEOUS CARDS ('Listening Check' Card, 'Deception Destroyer' Card 'Share' Card, 'Flirt' Card, 'Deal Breaker' Card, &amp; 'Compromise' Card) <br/>     2 PROTECTION CARDS<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>START: SHUFFLE CARDS WELL before starting (keeping all the cards facing the same direction). Choose which player will go first. Players must also choose in advance the level of play preferred for the 'REAL DEAL' Questions from the three levels listed below.<br/><br/>REAL DEAL QUESTION CARD LEVELS: <br/><br/>     LEVEL 1 ('a' questions) - Simple, light-hearted questions to learn a little about your date - questions that are generally easy to answer and don't take that much thought<br/>     LEVEL 2 ('b' questions) - Moderate get-to-know-your-date questions - questions that get a little more serious, where people can reveal a bit more about themselves<br/>     LEVEL 3 ('c' questions) - Deep questions designed to create a bonding emotional connection, or, to better spot potential 'RED FLAGS' in advance--ideal for 'bold' daters. Keep in mind DISHONESTY CAN DESTROY EVEN THE BEST OF RELATIONSHIPS! PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK! Warning: Some questions may be considered to some as personally inappropriate for a new date, even though the questions are in good taste. (The reason someone may pass on a question need not be explained -- besides, a little mystery can often prove to be an effective strategy as well.)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>PLAY: Each person is dealt 7 cards (one at a time) face down. The remaining cards are placed face down in a pile in the center of the table, forming the draw pile (or the Selection Pile). The first player (aka THE DISCARDER) takes a turn by drawing the top card from the Selection Pile followed by choosing a card to discard from his/her hand, reading it out loud first. Players then respond to any directions from the card accordingly. When finished, the DISCARDER places the card face up right alongside the Selection Pile, into what will be the Discard Pile (unless otherwise directed). Similarly, the other player then takes their turn, and so on.<br/><br/>SCORING: The game ends as soon as soon as the last card is picked up/discarded. The players then count the number of Rose Cards in their hands, and the player with the most roses wins. (If both players end up without any roses, it's considered a tie game.).<br/><br/>"}, "119446": {"rpg": {"17394": "Mascot-tan"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Mascot-tan", "rpgproducer": {"20046": "Ewen Cluney"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1223752.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"151269": "PDF Version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"174": "Animation / Comics (Anime / Manga)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpgseries": {"18289": "Kyawaii RPG Series"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1223752_t.jpg", "description": "From designer's website:<br/>Mascot-tan<br/><br/>A Roleplaying Game About<br/>The Cute, Disturbing Adventures<br/>Of Cute, Disturbed Little Girls<br/><br/>Mascot-tan is a weird little RPG where the players take on the roles of anime/manga mascot girls, in the vein of Habanero-tan and the OS Girls, and have wacky little adventures.

The original version (model SCPH-1010) was released alongside the PlayStation on December 3, 1994.<br/><br/>Based on the basic button configuration established with Nintendo's Super NES Controller, the PlayStation Controller added a second pair of shoulder buttons for the middle fingers. Intended to update the gamepad for navigating 3D environments such as the ones PlayStation was designed to generate, the concept behind featuring shoulder buttons for both the index and middle fingers was to implement two-way directional depth controls using the two sets of buttons. To compensate for the less stable grip from shifting the middle fingers' placement to the shoulders, grip handles were added to the controller.<br/><br/>Using the simple geometric shapes Triangle, Circle, Cross, and Square to label its action buttons rather than traditionally used letters or numbers, the PlayStation Controller established a trademark which would be incorporated heavily into the PlayStation brand. In an interview with Teiyu Goto, designer of the original Playstation Controller, he explains what the symbols mean. The circle and x represent yes and no respectively, the triangle symbolizes a point of view and the square is equated to a sheet of paper there to be used to access menus.<br/><br/>On April 2, 1996, Sony released a revised version of the PlayStation Controller (model SCPH-1080), featuring a longer cord with a ferrite bead. After briefly selling the Dual Analog Controller in 1997, Sony began phasing out the PlayStation Controller later that year with the introduction of the DualShock controller, which would become the new standard controller for the PlayStation.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;PlayStation Controller&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "119490": {"statistics": {}, "name": "PlayStation Memory Card", "usersrated": "4", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1546336.jpg", "videogamehwversion": {"263768": "Black Sony PlayStation Memory Card"}, "videogamehardwarecategory": {"2325": "Memory Card"}, "average": "6.125", "videogamehardware": {"4433": "PlayStation"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1546336_t.jpg", "videogamehwmfg": {"7370": "Sony Computer Entertainment"}, "description": "The original memory card for the Playstation holds 128 kB of space in an EEPROM.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;PlayStation (console)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "119491": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Double Fine Happy Action Theater", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"151377": "Xbox 360 XBLA edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2466": "Other"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2314": "Arcade"}, "videogameplatform": {"4407": "Xbox 360"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Happy Action Theater is an open-ended game, providing eighteen different modes that incorporate features of the Kinect motion-sensing and camera system.
