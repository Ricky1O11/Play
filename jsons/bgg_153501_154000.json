Not an ambush, as is popularly thought, the battle was actually a meeting engagement. The French in Fort Duquesne, told by scouts that a large British force with guns was approaching, sent elements of the Duquesne garrison on a preemptive strike. The French force met the British vanguard column before they could set up an ambush.<br/><br/>Braddock&rsquo;s Defeat is a two player game with each player taking the side of either the French or the British. Both players have allies to control: the British side American colonial and Indian units, the French side Canadian militia and Indian units.<br/><br/>Braddock&rsquo;s Defeat also is highly suitable for solitaire play.<br/><br/>This game was issued as a separate game as a gift to Gold donors for the 2014 Consimworld Donation Drive.<br/><br/>"}, "153601": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1903248.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Pressman Toy Corp."], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1903248_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Children's Game", "Deduction"], "description": "Spin the spinner and move up the path of the mystery mine.

Alcohol can be used as a fire starter, as a weapon in the form of molotov cocktails, as an antiseptic for wounds or to sterilize medical instruments. In certain cases it can be used as lamp fuel, stove fuel or even fuel in vehicles. Previous generations have used it to kill mold, remove stains, as a cough suppressant or even to quiet teething babies. Common alcohol does not always require large distilleries and heat sources to create.

Players make up family trees during the game learning russian history and lifestyles of different generations. Family Tree inculcates interest to country&rsquo;s past and own family history in a game form and develops improvisation and counting skills.<br/><br/>How much do we know about our ancestors? Where were they from? What job did they have and what were they fond of? How did they find their partners in life? We rarely think of it in our childhood but it&rsquo;s getting harder to find the answers by each year passing by. That&rsquo;s why it is so important to rouse up children&rsquo;s interest in family history as early as possible. Understanding of generation continuity and forefathers&rsquo; connection with historical events is just necessary for the child to grow up as an all-sufficient and self-contained person.<br/><br/>Each player is telling a story of a common Russian family, constructing its genealogy table. The game is based on the character cards with people of different generations on them, born in pre-revolutionary times at the first half of the 20th century towards to people of nowadays. Each character has a name, a profession, a date of birth and a portrait designed in a family picture album style &ndash; all these traits combine into a whole appearance of a typical representative of his age and social group, like a soviet scientist or a present-day manager, for example.<br/><br/>Single characters don&rsquo;t form a tree yet &ndash; they should be bound with family relationships. Married couples, children and parents need to be matched by age. It can be calculated in mind but birth dates are added to the cards for more convenience. After all, firstly, husbands and wives should meet each other: play a meeting card and tell a short acquaintance story. Also there are some event cards which can be played at the character, suitable by age &ndash; passing through the Great Patriotic war, attendance at Yuri Gagarin&rsquo;s first space flight start, election to State Duma (Russian Lower chamber). In such a way a personal family history binds with the global history of the country.<br/><br/>There are two varieties of game rules: &ldquo;The big family tree&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dynasties&rdquo;. The first one better goes with big companies up to 10 players and is suitable for the first play. In this case players construct one big tree, and the one who will be the first in playing all cards from the hand wins the game.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Dynasties&rdquo; is a basic and mostly profound game mode comfortable up to 4 players.

One player shuffles his deck, then places a card at random on the table; each other player takes this same card and places it on the table in his own area.

Brave souls seeking fortune and glory in the name of all that's good.  Eventually, they gained whatever it was they sought and have retired.  Too bad evil didn't do the same.  Thus quests and monsters grew in number until, finally, Percival Thistlewood invented 2 foot tall wooden golems which, when clothed, took on the role of whatever garmets they wore. Initially designed for utility, the popularity of these Dungeoneering Dolls quickly spread throughout the kingdom and now you are one of many collectors attempting to create the best collection of Dungeoneering Dolls.<br/><br/>As a simple card game, Dungeoneering Dolls has two types of cards.  The first is the quests, which occur at the end of the game, but the most cards are actually the Dolls. Dolls come in six classes and each class contains dolls numbered 1-8.  These dolls are all worth a set number of positive or negative points.  When you play them, you will stack like classed dolls on top of other like classed dolls.  So any new Ranger goes on top of a previous Ranger, if applicable.  There are also eight Limited Edition Dolls which may be played at any time and act as &quot;rule breakers.&quot;<br/><br/>When someone plays a card, there is a chance for another player to steal it.  To do this, they need to play a card of the superior class in an equal or higher level.  So Berserkers beat Thieves beat Rangers beat Wizards beat Knights beat Clerics beat Berserkers.  If a card is used to steal a card, they discard the card used and instead, claim the card they are stealing for their collection.<br/><br/>The game continues this way until the first quest is revealed in the draw pile.  Then players resolve each quest one by one until the game is over.  Quests will make demands like having the strongest Ranger.

Zero-value blocks known as &ldquo;Deception&rdquo; blocks could also be part of the exchange.

Players advance the ball along the playing surface (a 30 x 65 inch mat representing a football field) by flicking it with their fingers, thus causing it to slide on the playing surface. Each flick of the ball represents a play.<br/><br/>Prior to executing each play the offensive player chooses which type of play to use and determines where on the field he will place the individual members of his team. Simultaneously the defensive player places his individual team members on the field, in an attempt to guess the offensive play. After the defensive player has placed his tokens the offensive player then places his tokens according to the play previously chosen.<br/><br/>As in real football, the offensive player has four general options on each play: passing, running, punting or attempting a field goal.<br/><br/>In order for a pass play to be successful the offensive player must flick the ball, causing it to slide along the playing surface, ultimately contacting one of his own tokens. The player tokens consist of flat cardstock and when the ball token slides over top of them they tend to slide along with the ball token. When the ball stops sliding, if there is only an offensive player's token still caught underneath it, the play resulted in a pass completion. If there are one or more player tokens from each team, the pass was incomplete. If one or more tokens from the defensive team remain under the ball token, with no tokens from the offensive team, the pass was intercepted.<br/><br/>Running plays are not executed by sliding the ball. Instead both players secretly deploy their individual player tokens to any of the multiple eligible running lanes on the field. If the offensive player deployed his ball carrier to a running lane that was left unguarded by the defensive player, then he simply rolls three dice with the result being the number of yards gained on the play. If the lane is guarded by a defensive player, then both players roll a single die, and the yards gained (or lost) is determined by subtracting the defender's result from the offensive player's result.<br/><br/>Punting is performed by sliding the ball token down the field. If the ball slides into the endzone the receiving player can choose to start their drive at the 20-yard line, or attempt to return the punt by rolling dice to determine yardage.<br/><br/>Field goals are made by finger-flicking the ball token into the air and through a set of plastic uprights.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "age": "0", "name": "Action-Mat Football", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "average": "4.5", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Finger Flicking Games", "Sports: American Football / Gridiron"]}, "153732": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2586949.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Byron Collins"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Byron Collins"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Collins Epic Wargames"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2586949_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Dice", "Expansion for Base-game", "Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "The Spearpoint 1943: Eastern Front - Heavy Weapons Expansion adds all new Soviet and German &quot;heavies&quot; to the mix for the Spearpoint 1943 Eastern Front card wargame.

The game is divided into three ages, marked with different ship types. The first age is that of the galley, followed by the age of the galleon, then finally the steamship age. The board combines a track showing the development of ships, similar to that in Automobile, with a map of Europe and an area representing the rest of the world.<br/><br/>Your turn is divided into two phases. In the first phase, you choose to either conduct commerce (such as selling goods, taxing locations or improving your warehouse) or take a card, selecting one from seven on display; the cards vary in their effects, granting money, victory points or special actions.<br/><br/>In the second phase, you choose whether to place a ship, move a ship, or retrieve ships/merchants. When you place a ship, you do so in either the merchant box or the warship box in one of eleven levels. A merchant allows you to place a merchant cube on the board, giving you one or two goods counters to place in your warehouse. A warship lets you take control of a location at the cost of one food goods counter.<br/><br/>Once all of your ships are on the board, you can either move them (paying money to advance its level and take the associated action) or retrieve it from the board so that you can place it elsewhere later. As ships are placed in a level, the cost of placing in the next level reduces &mdash; until finally somebody is willing to pay the cost to place in that level (which earns bonus points and possible additional income). When a ship is placed in the first galleon level, galleys become redundant; similarly, someone placing in the first steamship level makes galleons redundant. During the galleon and steamship ages, you can pay extra to move more ships, so having money in hand gives you a greater range of options and allows you to use your fleet more efficiently.<br/><br/>When placing ships, you can initially place only in &quot;1&quot; locations, which are grouped around the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Once someone pays to move to a &quot;2&quot; location, which are grouped around the western Mediterranean, that area opens to others, with the other areas being Northern Europe (3), the Americas (4), East Indies (5) and the Pacific (6). As soon as a new area opens, players score points for merchants and control discs in the present area, with the points earned being the same as the number of the area.<br/><br/>Ships includes six types of goods: food, oil, metal, wine, cloth and spices. Each has a monetary value as well as a special power. Food can be used to take control of locations, thus building an empire. Oil can be used to gain extra actions. Metal helps to advance your ships along the outer track. Wine can be converted to goods of a lower value. Cloth can be converted to victory points, while spices have the highest monetary value. You have to decide whether to cash your goods in for money or use their power.<br/><br/>NOTE: this description is out-of-date.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English limited edition", "English standard edition"], "name": "Ships", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Area Control / Area Influence", "Area Movement"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "816", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "average": "7.01305", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 67- Kingdom Death: Monster and Women Representations in Games", "Episode 92- Barcelona: The Rose of Fire plus Gloomhaven Contest", "Heavy Cardboard Episode 35 \u2013 Food Chain Magnate", "Heavy Cardboard Episode 36 \u2013 Neue Heimat", "Ships Review"]}, "153739": {"rpgdesigner": ["Brian A.

Having no children of his own issue, any claim to his rather sizable fortune must issue from his legal will.  Unfortunately the Baron not only wrote many different wills in the last years of his life, it seems he tore them all to shreds.  The six known claimants have been given twelve hours to prove their rights to inherit.  As one of these claimants, you must search the Baron&rsquo;s country manor to find fragments of the will which name you as heir.<br/><br/>Would that it were only that simple.<br/><br/>The other potential heirs are collecting their claims as well, and there&rsquo;s nothing to stop them from picking up your fragments to keep you from having them.

It is played upon a board laid out in squares or rectangles, and the pieces employed represent and symbolize the important men and weapons of warfare, while their movements simulate the military evolutions of two armies opposed in battle, advancing, retreating and engaging in the diverse methods that characterize actual warfare, and employing all the various forms of strategy.<br/><br/>Each side, as a fighting force, comprises a king, a commanding officer, field and siege artillery, cavalry and ordinary troops and flying machines.<br/><br/>All the movements of Chess are found in the game, and, in addition, the troops have the movements made familiar in checkers or draughts, while some pieces are given different moves, and more freedom of movement than in either Chess or Checkers. But while these two games are thus drawn on to contribute all their virtues, the vital principle of The Game of War is radically different and wholly new.<br/><br/>In Chess the game is won when a player so hems in his adversary's king that it cannot escape capture; in Checkers all of the adversary's pieces must be captured and taken from the board, or the last of them penned, to secure a victory.<br/><br/>In The Game of War, however, the object is to lay siege to and capture the citadel &mdash; a central square in the king's rank on which the ruler is stationed at the outset of the game. When an adversary's piece can enter and hold this square without being captured at the next move, such occupancy of the citadel wins the game.<br/><br/>Chief of the many other distinctive features in The Game of War is the introduction of two flying machines on each side. The purpose and the movements of these are wholly novel, and give a singular fascination to the playing of the game. Moreover, the board used in the game is of a new design, having one hundred squares, instead of sixty-four, as in chess and checkers, and the all-important citadel square stands forth in battlemented prominence. In addition, there are four flying machine stations.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "153757": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1905264.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Josh Raab"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Chris Hernandez"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Eagle-Gryphon Games"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1905264_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Ancient"], "boardgamehonor": ["2013 Ion Award Best Strategy Game Winner", "2014 Golden Geek Best Abstract Board Game Nominee"], "description": "Command a Greek city's hoplite soldiers. Push and rout enemy lines. Coordinate allied attacks to secure victory, but watch your flanks!<br/><br/>Nika, inspired by ancient Greek geography &amp; warfare, is based around two core mechanisms: facing and formations. Pieces can be routed off the board if attacked from the side or back, but not from the front. A routed piece can rally back onto the board at the cost of an action. Your pieces can move or rotate together in a phalanx if they are adjacent and facing the same way, and you can push back enemies facing you if your phalanx is deeper than theirs.<br/><br/>There are four cities: Athens (white) and Messene (blue) are allied against Sparta (red) and Thebes (black). Allies start across the board from each other, and you win by getting a piece into your victory area in the heart of your ally's territory. Each two-city alliance can be played either solo or with a partner, so the game can support two, three, or four players.<br/><br/>Every player has enemies on both sides, making the distribution of both pieces and actions between fronts a strategic and often tactical consideration. Maneuvering, timing, coordination, and sacrifice are all key elements of strategy.<br/><br/>Says designer Josh Raab, &quot;Nika is the ancient Greek word for 'conquer'. The concept of Nika came to me in a dream while I was studying abroad in Athens. The rules were honed across nearly two years of testing. The board shape and core mechanics were inspired by ancient Greek geography and warfare. Greece has many narrow valleys and mountain passes, and sometimes the only way to defeat an enemy force was to collide with them head-on and literally push them off the field. This othismos ('shoving') is thought to have been the critical phase of most battles between hoplite armies, who were the heavy infantry that dominated ancient Greek war for four centuries.&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "6.6878", "name": "Nika", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement", "Partnerships"], "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": ["171631"], "usersrated": "82", "boardgameaccessory": ["Nika: Corinthian Helmet Turn Marker", "Nika: Strategy Guide"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "153758": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1902902.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Alex Davy"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Lin Bo", "Daryl Mandryk", "Neil Roberts"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Edge Entertainment", "Fantasy Flight Games", "Galakta", "Giochi Uniti", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag"], "maxplaytime": "150", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1902902_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "150", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Expansion for Base-game", "Exploration", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration"], "description": "Nemesis, the first expansion for Relic, introduces player-versus-player combat to the board game in an optional new &quot;Enemies of the Imperium&quot; game mode; in this mode, up to two players play as Nemeses, such as a World Eaters Berserker or a Eldar Dire Avenger, instead of characters.

The dungeon has over thirty rooms, mostly empty to allow the Game Master to add features to them but with several rooms with added details such as a pool, steel cage with demon head, glowing green mosses, a circle of red runes, skeletal remains, lion head statues, broken coffin, chains, sconces, scorch marks, pillars, spider webs, descending stairs, etc.<br/><br/>Dungeon Level 01 is intended for use in fantasy or horror settings.<br/><br/>Dungeon Level 01 can be printed out and used in full or it can be printed out in sections. Print out all the sections just for the room(s) you want to use, which will result in smaller maps for the space requirements of smaller gaming tables.<br/><br/>For adventure hooks, there are a lot of elements here. There is a pool, which could be magical with healing or boosting properties that can miraculously heal a wounded party member of a debilitating injury or boost their strength permanently in some way. The steel cage with the demon head could be used to hold an important Game Master Character that has information vital to their current quest that must be rescued. The room with the inscribed red ring could be used as a place for magical rituals where they need to perform a ritual or stop a summoning. Or perhaps an alchemist pays them for samples of the mysterious glowing green moss growing inside the dungeon.<br/><br/>"}, "153775": {"rpgdesigner": ["Totte Alm"], "rpg": ["Operation: Fallen Reich"], "poll": [], "name": "Going West", "rpgartist": ["Totte Alm"], "rpgproducer": ["Totte Alm"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1903861.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Crime (Mystery / Detective / Noir)", "History (Europe)", "Occult", "War"], "rpgpublisher": ["4Eyes"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Wicked Times"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1903861_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>This is an adventure for the RPG Operation:Fallen Reich, for 4 players.<br/><br/>This is an adventure suitable for a 4-5 hour game, starting October 9, 1939.<br/><br/>Plot Excerpt:<br/><br/>&quot;The Germans are very keen on keeping the good business deals they have with American companies like the big three from Detroit, Standard Oil and US Steel.

The performers were not only just great, among them hid a few hand picked Fallens with special mind controlling powers.

Well, it's easier than it seems. All you need is a personal planet, several billions of faithful yet simple-minded minions (preferably small-sized and green-skinned) and a dozen of cunning plans. Or two dozens for your own piece of mind. Who are your archrivals? No superheroes I assure you as they are just mythic figures from graphic novels. So, you should beware your competitors, other villains who are eager to add the prefix super to their proud title.<br/><br/>Today becoming the Supervillain is even simpler than ever! A new boardgame by Right Games and Anton Lozovskiy provides you with everything you need for this fascinating activity. But for opponents &mdash; I assume every self-respecting villain must have some.<br/><br/>Become Supervillain is a boardgame for two&mdash;five players aged 12+. While competing for the title of the principal anti-hero, players spend their minions to complete secret projects, spin vicious intrigues and shatter opponents' plans with meteorites. You must be first to collect secret projects valued 5,000 points to win the game. Besides, the game can end earlier if all plan cards have been drawn. Then a player with overall maximum points becomes the Supervillain.<br/><br/>There're two types of cards: plans (they are also secret projects and meteorites) and intrigues (they are also minions). Before the game starts, cards are shuffled into two separate decks and each player draws two intrigues. At turn's start, the active player draws a card from each deck, puts the intrigue in his/her hand and decides what to do with the plan card either by playing it face-up as a plan or face-down as a meteorite. To complete plans you need minions: as soon as the total value of minions on one of your plans become equal or exceed its cost, it becomes the secret project and yields victory points. Often it also gives you special abilities. If you don't want to handle some plan, you may turn it into a meteorite and send at somebody as a valuable gift. Then the card is put face-down with the arrow pointing at your victim. The latter has time before your next turn to deal with the flying meteorite (some intrigues allow shooting them down or even redirecting them). If your meteorite has successfully hit the victim, you draw an extra card from the deck and &mdash; the most important &mdash; destroy a minion on any of his/her plans.<br/><br/>Intrigue cards can also be played in two ways. First &mdash; as an intrigue itself, in accordance with its text. Their effects are versatile and cunning as true villain's thoughts: take cards from opponents, charge meteorites, protect yourself, accelerate plans, etc. Second &mdash; as a minion, by placing it on your plan (its value is indicated in the upper part of the card).

No separate board or pieces are required as the cards themselves represent squares of a growing board that takes shape as the game progresses.  A deck consists of 64 cards.  Each player uses 16 cards, matching the pieces and pawns of a standard chess set. They can choose one of four colours (white, black, red and blue).<br/><br/>Cards are dealt, face-up, into shuffled 'Battleplans' from which cards are played, in the shuffled order, into a central playing area.  Each card represents a square of a chess board.  A square can be occupied (card face-up) or unoccupied (face-down).  On each turn, a card is either placed as a piece/pawn or empty square; or moved according to traditional chess movement rules &ndash; but they can only move within the board squares already created.  When a card is placed (a new square), it must be connected to an existing square of the board.  When a card moves, it is swapped with the destination card so the growing board is preserved.<br/><br/>Kings can be placed on any turn where there are at least six empty squares on the board.  If a player chooses to do so, all opponents must use their next turn to place their King.  The aim of En Prise, like chess,  is to checkmate opposing Kings.  When a player is checkmated, their board cards are turned over to become empty squares on their next turn.  The winner is the last remaining player.<br/><br/>Variations described in the rules include En Prise Casino, En Prise Alliance, En Prise Memory and En Prise Blind.<br/><br/>"}, "153792": {"rpgdesigner": ["J.

Action takes place in a fantasy world of Eador which is broken into pieces of a past holistic world, surfing across the Astral. Players take roles of the Masters, mighty demigods, trying to subordinate as many Eador shards as possible. They forward armies to conquer new territories, cast spells and perform powerful rituals.<br/><br/>The board game suits for 2-6 players but it&rsquo;s mostly comfortable to play for at least 4 players. All players get their Master cards at the game start &ndash; such cards exist not only for the atmosphere, they also help to settle some controversies. 12-18 shard cards (amount depends on the number of players) are mixed up to a separate pile and the game is over when this pile flows out. There are always two shard cards on the table, the one for the current round and another for the next &ndash; it helps players to plan their moves concentrating on the shards which are easier to get. Shard conquering is performed by playing action cards; there are more then 100 of them &ndash; armies, spells and rituals. At the game beginning everyone gets 7 action cards to the hand. Usually it&rsquo;s possible to add only one more card during the turn so using them should be careful. Rituals are the cards with especially strong features letting, for example, to take more action cards, take someone else&rsquo;s action or shard cards, to gain more winning points. Player can&rsquo;t fight for the chard during the turn if he performs a ritual but these cards give him further advantage.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the round each player decides if he will fight for the current shard or not. You need to play an army or a spell card to join a battle. The most important feature of the army is its power. Also there are the type of the army on the card (Light, Chaos or neutral), its class (warrior, monster, magician or undead) and nature of the ground (hills, swamps, plains, forests). Armies and some spells stay in the battle to the end of the round, some spells work only for the round they were played at. The result of the battle round is counted when all players interested in the shard have made their moves. The owner of the strongest army gets authority points counters according to his advantage above the second contender. Players can give up from the second turn and leave the battle. In this case they can&rsquo;t play armies or spells anymore for the current battle but still have a chance to win if nobody acquires more authority points. When all players pass the battle ends and the shard goes to the player who gained maximum authority points.<br/><br/>Each battle has some pieces of subtleties. Firstly, it&rsquo;s impossible to play Light and Chaos armies without a special card. Secondly, all the shards are different: some of them give advantages to defined type or class of armies or restrict using them, others allow to play two armies in a round. Thirdly, all armies fighting for the shard at the &ldquo;native&rdquo; land get extra strength. Attentive player will get a big profit considering all these features. When battle for the last shard is over players count their winning points on their conquered shards and performed rituals. That sum shows the winner.<br/><br/>The game for two or three players differs &ndash; they get 3 or 2 Master cards and make more actions during the round &ndash; to play a ritual and take part in the battle.<br/><br/>"}, "153846": {"rpgdesigner": ["Matt Banach"], "rpg": ["Lords of Gossamer & Shadow"], "poll": [], "name": "Brokeworld", "rpgartist": ["Trung Ta Ha"], "rpgproducer": ["James Hazelett", "Steven D.

La Revoluci&oacute;n Francesa, a finales del siglo XVIII, hab&iacute;a supuesto un cambio en la concepci&oacute;n de la estructura de la sociedad y muchos derechos y privilegios tradicionales se estaban poniendo en duda. Estas ideas revolucionarias recorrieron Europa y convirtieron a Francia en un peligro para los gobiernos m&aacute;s tradicionales. La presi&oacute;n de estos gobiernos favoreci&oacute; la llegada al poder de Napole&oacute;n y con &eacute;l un r&eacute;gimen pol&iacute;tico bastante opuesto a las ideas liberales de la Revoluci&oacute;n Francesa, pero bastante efectivo militarmente para enfrentarse y derrotar a casi todos sus enemigos. S&oacute;lo Gran Breta&ntilde;a parec&iacute;a resistir los envites de Napole&oacute;n y fruto de su juego pol&iacute;tico, militar y diplom&aacute;tico, Espa&ntilde;a y Portugal se vieron envueltos en una guerra que en su mayor parte se desarrollar&iacute;a sobre la pen&iacute;nsula. La sociedad espa&ntilde;ola se divide en tras bandos: los absolutistas que cre&iacute;an que Fernando deb&iacute;a seguir gobernando Espa&ntilde;a como hasta entonces, los afrancesados que pensaban que los cambios que provocar&iacute;a un gobierno franc&eacute;s ser&iacute;an mejores que seguir con el gobierno anterior y los liberales que cre&iacute;an que tanto absolutistas como Napole&oacute;n representaban el pasado y que hab&iacute;a llegado el momento de hacer nuestra propia Revoluci&oacute;n Francesa. Estas tres corrientes de pensamiento se enfrentar&iacute;an pol&iacute;tica y militarmente durante varios a&ntilde;os creando situaciones muy sugerentes para una partida de rol: intrigas palaciegas, escaramuzas, batallas campales, etc.<br/><br/><br/>PUBLISHER'S INFO<br/><br/>The early nineteenth century was a time of great social upheaval.  The French Revolution in the late eighteenth century had wrought a change in the concept of the structure of society and many traditional rights and privileges were being questioned. These revolutionary ideas spread out of France across Europe France and became a danger to the more traditional governments. Pressure from these governments favored the rise to power of Napoleon as he seemed quite opposite to the liberal ideas of the French Revolution political regime.  But his rise made France quite effective militarily to confront and defeat almost all enemies.  Only Britain seemed to resist the stakes of Napoleon, and the result of its political, military and diplomatic efforts were that Spain and Portugal became embroiled in a war that would develop over almost the entire Iberian peninsula.<br/><br/>In this game, the Spanish society is divided into the following camps: <br/><br/>     those who believed that absolutist Fernando Spain should continue to govern as before, <br/>     the Francophile who thought the changes caused by the French government would be better to continue with the previous government, and <br/>     liberals who believed that the absolutist Napoleon represented the past and the time to make our own version of the French revolution had arrived. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>These three schools of thought would face off politically and militarily for several years, creating suggestive gaming situations for starting roles: palace intrigues, skirmishes, pitched battles, etc.<br/><br/>"}, "153869": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "name": "Teufelsrad", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1904913_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Der Spielkasten"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1904913.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Spielkasten edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "poll": [], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Each player gets 3 meeples, which he has to move from the starting space to the center of the game board.

The building is located in what now is the outskirts of the small town East Dereham, about 15 miles east of Norwich. It is the oldest building in the village, and it was first recorded in books in the early sixteens century. The basement is much older than that, and it do contain a secret that has been well kept since the days of Merlin and Arthur. Hidden in the basement behind a well hidden secret door, is a catacomb where a fallen has been trapped. Powerful magic seals of the area and even blocks any paranormal abilities to detect the presence of a fallen.<br/><br/>Over the centuries, many children have discovered the secret door in search for adventure and unknowingly wandered into the catacomb. Those moments have ended in disasters, and three times have the house been burnt down, leaving only the stone bedrock, In every fire many people have died, but never enough people to give the fallen power enough to break the seal that keeps him locked in here. The house have then been rebuilt after each fire, while the fallen have still been trapped deep below. The fallen is not physically trapped, but can only leave the catacombs for a short period of time, using a controlled body. To leave the place for good, a powerful ritual has to take place, which requires a large amount of dead people to break the bond locking his spiritual form to this very place.<br/><br/>Back to the present time. For the past two months, whole families have been disappearing from the small town of East Dereham. It all began when the young boy Allister Clarke went missing, and a few days later his family. Then a week later another family, then another. Scotland Yard put their best man on the job, Detective Inspector Sir Henry Porter, but after three weeks and several families gone missing, the Yard have turned over the case, first to M.I.5, then it ended up on the desk of the commander of Operation: Fallen Reich. --&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "153878": {"rpgdesigner": ["Totte Alm"], "rpg": ["Operation: Fallen Reich"], "poll": [], "name": "A Merry Christmas", "rpgartist": ["Totte Alm"], "rpgproducer": ["Totte Alm"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1905291.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Crime (Mystery / Detective / Noir)", "History (Europe)", "Occult", "War"], "rpgpublisher": ["4Eyes"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Lurking Dangers"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1905291_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>This is an adventure for the RPG Operation: Fallen Reich, for 4 players.<br/><br/>This is a short adventure suitable for a 2-3 hour game, starting anywhere in England, December 22, 1937.<br/><br/>Plot Excerpt:<br/><br/>&quot;In the early 1930s in Montpelier, France, the eccentric professor in parapsychology Claude Bousquet, was expelled from the university&rsquo;s research department after a tragic accident involving several students who was either killed or severely injured.

After realizing it needed a sillier tone, he quickly went from &ldquo;a little bit lighthearted&rdquo; to &ldquo;quite a bit silly&rdquo; as he realized Jan&rsquo;s art would be perfect for his new vision of the game. Having found his ad in the programming schedule for Anthrocon 2011, Reynard contacted Jan with his crazy idea for him to become Lead Artist for the project. The ad pointed to Swords and Sausages (now Reynard&rsquo;s favorite webcomic), which showcased Jan&rsquo;s vibrant imagination and his talents as an artist.<br/><br/>Jan quickly became the Lead Artist for Tails and Tactics and development continued for almost two years before finally releasing at Anthrocon 2013.

Duh.<br/>In order to do that, though, you must fight through your opponent's front line and attack his or her base enough to deplete its health to 0 - before they do so to you.<br/>Each player begins the game with 30 Base Health. Base Health is lost when a unit controlled by an opposing player attacks your base (represented by you, the player). They may only do so, though, when you have no units on the field to defend with. If you do have units on the field that are able to defend, opponents must remove them before being able to attack your base directly.<br/>1 base health is lost per attack, no matter how powerful (or weak) the attacking unit is. Some powerful units make up for this by having the ability to attack multiple times, so watch out!<br/>Base health may also be lost when an opponent attacks one of your units and you choose to dodge the attack. Any dodged attacks will be applied directly to your base.<br/>Once your opponent's base health reaches 0, you are victorious!

The Brief<br/>A meeting, telephone call, email or letter is the catalyst for a series of events where danger lurks in the shadows.<br/><br/>4. Infiltration<br/>An overall sense of dread envelopes you when you discreetly enter the state-of-the-art facility.<br/><br/>5. Ambient<br/>A moment to reflect where secret agents become ambivalent when their duty to the mission conflicts with their consciences.<br/><br/>6. Manhunt<br/>A dangerous chase in a network of power and crime.<br/><br/>7. Suit Up<br/>The final battle approaches, and only you have what it takes.<br/><br/>8. Urban Parkour<br/>Desperate pursuit across rooftops in a city where death is on the line.<br/><br/>9. Purging The Demon<br/>A desperate struggle between human and vampire.<br/><br/>10. Heist<br/>Heavyweight direct brute force is sometimes the agents&rsquo; only recourse.<br/><br/>11. Conspyramid<br/>Conspiracy theories take a horrific turn after uncovering an ancient and dangerous secret society.<br/><br/>12. Covert Ops<br/>Behind enemy lines sometimes subterfuge is the best approach.<br/><br/>13. The Great Escape<br/>Confrontation is futile, all you can do now is run for your life.

An Eye For An Eye<br/>An all out horror piece where the character is alone, vulnerable and miles away from any other human being.<br/><br/>16. Horror<br/>The unfortunate and unforeseen event of meeting with blood-thirsty Vampires.<br/><br/>17. Darkness<br/>The true nature and power of the Vampires is revealed. Few can stand against it!<br/><br/>18. Crawlers<br/>You can feel them watching, waiting patiently for you to come out of your hiding place.<br/><br/>19.

This is not obvious. Instead, it appears to be square due to the commonplace elongation of the diagonal dimension and/or shortening of the orthogonal dimension which is the universal convention for representing them.<br/>This implicates why a perfect mapping onto the surface of a 3-D sphere, from a circle rather than a square, is ideally suitable and achievable.]<br/><br/>Fortunately, the players are not required to deal with any complex, confusing 3-D curvature characteristic to a spherical playing surface.<br/><br/>This is the advantage to using flat 2-D representations of a spherical-surface, 3-D chess variant.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "0", "name": "Spherical Chess 324", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Chess Games"]}, "153977": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1910213.jpg", "poll": [], "statistics": [], "boardgamecompilation": ["Zombicide Survivor: Thiago"], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "6", "age": "13", "boardgamepublisher": ["CMON Limited", "Edge Entertainment", "Guillotine Games"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1910213_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Horror", "Miniatures", "Zombies"], "description": "Black Friday is about danger and power.

It's Yahtzee, meets Uno, meets Parcheesi!<br/><br/>Mice &amp; Dice is a family-friendly game that is fun for all ages! Choose or roll your number (d6) in the beginning of the game. If YOU roll your number on your turn, you get 2 points. If anyone else rolls your number on THEIR turn, you get 1 point. Every 5 points that you obtain you get to roll an extra dice (starting with one, max of 5). If anyone, including you, ever rolls your number two times or more you get to choose a mice or rat card. Mice cards help you, Rat cards hurt other players (i.e. Fat Rat- Roll 1 less die). After scoring 25 points, you enter the cheese phase where you then have the option of pulling cheese cards if more than one of your number is rolled. Cheese cards give you extra points based on the cheese card. The first player to 50 points wins!<br/><br/>The game is for 2-6 players and takes about 15 minutes to play.<br/><br/>"}, "153991": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2512177.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Peter Gousis", "Michael D.

Watts (Railway Rivals and others) for the Greater Glasgow Passenger Transport Executive as part of publicity to show how easy it was to get around Glasgow and the surrounding areas (of west Central Scotland) using public transport.<br/><br/>It is a race game comprising a number of short rounds (the rules suggest 3 or 4), where each player starts from a randomly allocated railway station, and must visit three places of interest (in any order) using a combination of overground rail, underground/subway system (affectionately known as &quot;The Clockwork Orange&quot;) or buses, then return to their start point to win that round. The person to get back &quot;home&quot; first scores 5 points, the others scoring one point for each site of interest reached. The overall winner is the person with most points at the end of the pre-agreed number of rounds.<br/><br/>The board is made up of a hexagonal base, overprinted with the main rail routes, stations and places of interest (that the players must visit). Each round has a different theme - shopping centres, scenic locations, sports stadia, etc. Players roll two dice if they want to travel by train or subway, and one die if travelling by bus. Certain die rolls will result in &quot;incident&quot; cards, which may force a detour, a missed turn etc.<br/><br/>2-6 players, but best with 3-4.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>Game Board<br/>Rules (1p)<br/>2 6-sided dice<br/>8 Hexagonal plastic playing pieces with a Bus on one face, and a Train on the opposite<br/>30 Destination Cards<br/>14 Rail Incident Cards<br/>14 Bus Incident Cards<br/><br/>"}, "153999": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2621938.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["David Chircop", "Yannick Massa"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Marie Cardouat", "David Chircop", "Todd Sanders"], "boardgamepublisher": ["LudiCreations"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2621938_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Print & Play"], "boardgamehonor": ["2014 Golden Geek Best Print & Play Board Game Nominee", "2014 Golden Geek Best Print & Play Board Game Winner"], "description": "...and then we held hands. is a co-operative game about finding balance.

His undead pack vigilantly scours the grounds for intruders, never resting.<br/>    The Regnant Void: Deep in the parched ochre canyons of the Weranavas Badlands, a cloister of hagspawn worg mystics capture and dissect the troubled nightmares of mortals. Calling themselves the Regnant Void, the worgs hunt the dreams of mortals via the mystical, undulant canyons which channel and focus distant nightmares.

Body, that covers three sections, is placed at the track between the legs. &ldquo;Losing&rdquo; legs is permitted: each leg should touch the body at least diagonally all the time. So the bug can not stretch for more than 5 sections.<br/><br/>When the game begins, players place their bugs at the start positions &ndash; the three first sections of the track. Tracks cross at the middle of the table and connected by the central element with the race aim on it. They are not bonded hard so players don&rsquo;t pull others&rsquo; tracks while moving their own bugs. If needed, in case of lack of free space on the table for example, playing is possible without a center element. And of cause you don&rsquo;t need extra tracks if there are less than 4 players.<br/><br/>Moving bugs is performed by using special cards. Each of them allows to move 2 or 3 legs, a front left and a middle right, for example. In the beginning of each round players draw two of such cards from the stack. One of them stays at the hand and another one goes to the next player. Then both cards in the hand should be played in any order. Player moves all the stated legs forward if there is a free notch and the leg won&rsquo;t be torn off the body. It&rsquo;s possible to move the bug&rsquo;s body forward as well at any time during the turn if it won&rsquo;t cause a leg loss.<br/><br/>When everyone finish playing cards &ndash; by verbal understanding cards can be played all at the same time or by turns &ndash; players discard them and draw the new ones. The game is over when at least one bug has passed the finish line by its body, which should be located at the three last track sections. If such a bug is the only one, its owner wins the game. If there are several challengers, the winner is defined by the location of legs.<br/><br/>Skillful players can play 4 cards instead of 2 during the turn. In that case each player draws 4 cards from the stack, leaves one in the hand and gives three to the next player, chooses one from the derived cards and gives two, and at last gives one and keeps another. By the way, players can choose the convenient design: there is a forest glade with an apple at the one side and a space station with a big red button at the other. Bugs are also two-sided, well-matched to the game field. Of cause, nothing impedes robot-bugs to land on the Earth as well as common insects can visit a space station, it will be even more interesting.<br/><br/>"}, "153572": {"rpgdesigner": ["Bryan Fazekas", "John Fredericks", "Andrew Hamilton", "Lenard Lakofka", "Nicole Massey", "Dan Rasaiah"], "statistics": [], "name": "& (Issue 7 - Winter 2013)", "rpgartist": ["Fingolwyn", "John Fredericks", "Payton Gauldin", "Caleb Horowitz", "Milo", "Del Teigeler"], "rpgproducer": ["Andreas Claren", "Bryan Fazekas", "Ralph Glatt", "Andrew Hamilton", "Nicole Massey", "Dan Rasaiah", "Ian Slater"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1896174.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["& Magazine"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Archer / Archer-Ranger PC Class", "Armor of the Deep & Armor of Ice", "Creature Feature I: Ecology of the Sindh", "Creature Feature II: Ecology of the Greymen", "Creature Feature III: Some New Mephits", "Creature Feature IV: Para-Elemental Grues", "A Deeper Look At Saving Throws", "Doom AD&D", "Elemental Expansion and True Elementals", "Elemental Haiku", "Emporia & Domiciles: The Nexus", "Folding Tent", "Friend or Foe: The Jann Ak-Azul", "Gloves of Superlative Somatic Articulation & Satch's Screw of Supreme Security", "Hydra Ring", "Interview with Vince Florio, Wild Games Productions", "Lyman's Boots of Familiar Restoration", "Map 1: Fortress of the Efreeti Lord", "Map 2: Caverns Deep and Dark", "Mini-Adventure: The FireForge", "One Page Dungeon: The Oasis of Blessed Curses", "Potion of Power & Potion of Mind Restoration", "Potion of the Gale, Ilmaater\u2019s Gauntlets of Frost & Rittigan\u2019s Industrious Spider", "Potion of Ultra-Healing", "Raise Dead Balm & Potion of Neutralize Poison", "Rod of the Sentinel & Solomor's Fist of The Pyre", "Spell Caster's Paradise I: Para-Elemental Spells", "Spell Caster's Paradise II: Forging Spells", "The Toybox: New Weapons IV \u2013 Pole Arms and Daggers", "Tread Softly", "Wave Armor & Armor of the Kraken", "You want to do WHAT???

This is a war type fighting game utilizing cards and dice. Unique game mechanics, multiple target options, independent enemies and allies and battlefield teleportation makes AD an amazing card game experience to be enjoyed by hard core card gamers as well as the casual gamer alike.<br/><br/>Champion abilities are totally unique to the powers they have.  What does that mean? Take for example the blood champion, her power and power beasts cards will have different effects from those of different champions.  She has combo type power cards where as the water champion has evolution type power cards.  Another example is the fire champion having preload damage type power cards(Preload is a type of card where you use currency to determine the time or damage a card will perform before its played) where as the imagination champion will be very location specific.  All that to say, skilled play will be vital to winning, not just having the best cards.<br/><br/>Awaken Destruction will give you all the tools you need to build a great deck to start and you compete to make them stronger. There are no additional packs to buy after the initial purchase unless a champion update comes out. Your starter deck will have the maximum number of each card your champion can have and then you can tailor it down to your style of game play. There is no random card pack selling going on in AD. If a champion update is released, you will know every single card in that update before you buy it.  We feel this method allows players to spend more time playing and less time spending.<br/><br/>You haven't played a card game like this before. I never played TCGs prior to designing AD. When I created this, I had no idea what was already out on the market or what had come before me.  I created a game I felt would be very fun to play,  a skill based game that rewards a players abilitiy to think and adapt changing strategies as they play.  You are not out of this game just because you are down at the moment.  Cards and luck can change in an instant. Its kind of an emotional rollercoaster at times.  Ive been down and out for what I thought was a no win senario and the independant enemies came in and rocked the other player and gave me that little window of hope that I was able to use to finish the match.  On the other hand, I been in games where I thought I had it in the bag and and I few heals from killing bonuses and the other player was right back in the game, so you never really know how it's gonna turn out.  Which is why having the ability to adapt different play styles mid-game is going to be what seperates the good players from the great ones.      <br/><br/><br/>"}, "153582": {"rpgdesigner": ["Wyn F.

For that, you can turn to a mythic heritage. This new aspect of mythic characters allows for further customization of your mythic character. A mythic character can choose a mythic heritage in addition to his or her mythic path, and doing so grants him access to a number of unique abilities that are designed to reflect the flavor of his heritage, while also being of value to characters of every mythic path.<br/><br/>This installment explores the demonic heritage, and characters whose mythic power comes from demons, the abyss, or similar sources of evil and chaos. Whether your ancestor was a demon prince, your powers come from a profane ritual that you were exposed to as a child, or you&rsquo;re simply tainted in some way by the foul presence of the abyss, this mythic heritage allows you to tap into that dark power. The book includes 17 new mythic abilities, all of which are part of the demonic mythic heritage. Summon mythic demons to aid you in combat, wield a balor&rsquo;s flaming whip, tempt mortals with promises of power, and render yourself immune to anything that would target your black and shriveled soul. This is the power of the abyss, and it can be yours to command.<br/><br/>"}}
