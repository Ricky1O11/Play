Not an ambush, as is popularly thought, the battle was actually a meeting engagement. The French in Fort Duquesne, told by scouts that a large British force with guns was approaching, sent elements of the Duquesne garrison on a preemptive strike. The French force met the British vanguard column before they could set up an ambush.<br/><br/>Braddock&rsquo;s Defeat is a two player game with each player taking the side of either the French or the British. Both players have allies to control: the British side American colonial and Indian units, the French side Canadian militia and Indian units.<br/><br/>Braddock&rsquo;s Defeat also is highly suitable for solitaire play.<br/><br/>This game was issued as a separate game as a gift to Gold donors for the 2014 Consimworld Donation Drive.<br/><br/>"}, "153601": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1903248.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"115": {"name": "Pressman Toy Corp."}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1903248_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "description": "Spin the spinner and move up the path of the mystery mine.

Alcohol can be used as a fire starter, as a weapon in the form of molotov cocktails, as an antiseptic for wounds or to sterilize medical instruments. In certain cases it can be used as lamp fuel, stove fuel or even fuel in vehicles. Previous generations have used it to kill mold, remove stains, as a cough suppressant or even to quiet teething babies. Common alcohol does not always require large distilleries and heat sources to create.

Players make up family trees during the game learning russian history and lifestyles of different generations. Family Tree inculcates interest to country&rsquo;s past and own family history in a game form and develops improvisation and counting skills.<br/><br/>How much do we know about our ancestors? Where were they from? What job did they have and what were they fond of? How did they find their partners in life? We rarely think of it in our childhood but it&rsquo;s getting harder to find the answers by each year passing by. That&rsquo;s why it is so important to rouse up children&rsquo;s interest in family history as early as possible. Understanding of generation continuity and forefathers&rsquo; connection with historical events is just necessary for the child to grow up as an all-sufficient and self-contained person.<br/><br/>Each player is telling a story of a common Russian family, constructing its genealogy table. The game is based on the character cards with people of different generations on them, born in pre-revolutionary times at the first half of the 20th century towards to people of nowadays. Each character has a name, a profession, a date of birth and a portrait designed in a family picture album style &ndash; all these traits combine into a whole appearance of a typical representative of his age and social group, like a soviet scientist or a present-day manager, for example.<br/><br/>Single characters don&rsquo;t form a tree yet &ndash; they should be bound with family relationships. Married couples, children and parents need to be matched by age. It can be calculated in mind but birth dates are added to the cards for more convenience. After all, firstly, husbands and wives should meet each other: play a meeting card and tell a short acquaintance story. Also there are some event cards which can be played at the character, suitable by age &ndash; passing through the Great Patriotic war, attendance at Yuri Gagarin&rsquo;s first space flight start, election to State Duma (Russian Lower chamber). In such a way a personal family history binds with the global history of the country.<br/><br/>There are two varieties of game rules: &ldquo;The big family tree&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dynasties&rdquo;. The first one better goes with big companies up to 10 players and is suitable for the first play. In this case players construct one big tree, and the one who will be the first in playing all cards from the hand wins the game.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Dynasties&rdquo; is a basic and mostly profound game mode comfortable up to 4 players. Each player makes up his own family tree or several at time which can be united during the game. Families of different players can become related with each other. Overall number of relatives, antiquity of the exact family name and participation in historical events influences the victory.<br/><br/>"}, "153618": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Anduin (Issue 80 - Feb 2003)", "rpgproducer": {"58290": "Tommy Heinig"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1898120.png", "usersrated": "1", "average": "8", "rpgissue": {"3093": "Anduin"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"155428": "Abenteuerwettbewerb, Umfrage"}, "rpg": {"1209": "Gemini"}, "rpgissueversion": {"230102": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1898120_t.png", "description": "This issue contains the third and last part of the DSA Schriftrollentrilogie adventures, as well as another DSA scenario - both with stats for 3rd and 4th edition alike.

(Limes includes two sets of cards, one for each player, but if you combine copies of the game, any number of people can play at the same time.)<br/><br/>Each player has his own deck of cards. One player shuffles his deck, then places a card at random on the table; each other player takes this same card and places it on the table in his own area.

Players also score for having four or more houses in an uninterrupted sequence along one of the roads on the board.

Still others look to the adventuring profession for the inspiration they need to produce that next great masterpiece. Regardless of their source of income, maestros are often eccentric and almost always possessed of an incredible ego, making their kind an excellent topic for gossip.<br/><br/>The latest in Interjection Games' growing library of base classes, The Maestro Base Class offers up a fairly simple gameplay concept, which is this: what would happen if a bard could compose and perform his own custom performances? Featuring nearly 70 compositions that can be mixed and matched in a number of musical scores, the maestro plays less like a jack-of-all-trades and more like a mystic theurge that just so happens to have music as one of its two sources of power.

Brave souls seeking fortune and glory in the name of all that's good.  Eventually, they gained whatever it was they sought and have retired.  Too bad evil didn't do the same.  Thus quests and monsters grew in number until, finally, Percival Thistlewood invented 2 foot tall wooden golems which, when clothed, took on the role of whatever garmets they wore. Initially designed for utility, the popularity of these Dungeoneering Dolls quickly spread throughout the kingdom and now you are one of many collectors attempting to create the best collection of Dungeoneering Dolls.<br/><br/>As a simple card game, Dungeoneering Dolls has two types of cards.  The first is the quests, which occur at the end of the game, but the most cards are actually the Dolls. Dolls come in six classes and each class contains dolls numbered 1-8.  These dolls are all worth a set number of positive or negative points.  When you play them, you will stack like classed dolls on top of other like classed dolls.  So any new Ranger goes on top of a previous Ranger, if applicable.  There are also eight Limited Edition Dolls which may be played at any time and act as &quot;rule breakers.&quot;<br/><br/>When someone plays a card, there is a chance for another player to steal it.  To do this, they need to play a card of the superior class in an equal or higher level.  So Berserkers beat Thieves beat Rangers beat Wizards beat Knights beat Clerics beat Berserkers.  If a card is used to steal a card, they discard the card used and instead, claim the card they are stealing for their collection.<br/><br/>The game continues this way until the first quest is revealed in the draw pile.  Then players resolve each quest one by one until the game is over.  Quests will make demands like having the strongest Ranger.  You'll discard the Doll which fulfills the quest to claim it and in the end, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Each hand takes 9-12 minutes to play and a longer game may be desired, in which case, play to a set number of points.  Percival Thistlewood's Incredible Dungeoneering Dolls was initially released on The Game Crafter in both Poker Sized and Tarot Sized card formats.

Players take control of the Allies or Central Powers fighting the war on land, at sea, and in the air all the while making tough economic and technological decisions at home.<br/><br/>Fields of Despair has a unique block system designed to maintain the fog of war throughout the entire game. In most games, block combat values range from one to four. In Fields of Despair the range is zero to twenty.<br/><br/>The range in values makes Fields of Despair a very deceptive game. Players can build up a large force with a single block instead of giving away their strategy with a stack of blocks.<br/><br/>Movement is simple and free flowing. Players are allowed to &ldquo;make change&rdquo; during the movement phase. Thus a block with a combat value of 16 could be broken in two blocks of 8 before moving, or conversely two blocks could be combined into one. Zero-value blocks known as &ldquo;Deception&rdquo; blocks could also be part of the exchange. Thus after every movement phase you never really know the strength of your enemy.<br/><br/>The fog of war isn&rsquo;t lost after first contact with the enemy. Blocks remain hidden even when enemies occupy the same hex and stay hidden until one player decides to allocate an air squadron for reconnaissance or sends his men across no man&rsquo;s land.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"230295": "GMT first edition"}, "average": "8.35285", "name": "Fields of Despair: France 1914-1918", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "13", "usersrated": "138", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"6137": "Block wargames"}}, "153729": {"boardgamedesigner": {"73046": {"name": "Ben Mora"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Flip!", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2004": "Set Collection"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "13", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1969289_t.jpg", "average": "5.26923", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2456": {"name": "The Game Crafter, LLC"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1969289.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"230298": "English first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Flip! is an exciting new twist on classic Rummy; the cards are double-sided.

Players advance the ball along the playing surface (a 30 x 65 inch mat representing a football field) by flicking it with their fingers, thus causing it to slide on the playing surface. Each flick of the ball represents a play.<br/><br/>Prior to executing each play the offensive player chooses which type of play to use and determines where on the field he will place the individual members of his team. Simultaneously the defensive player places his individual team members on the field, in an attempt to guess the offensive play. After the defensive player has placed his tokens the offensive player then places his tokens according to the play previously chosen.<br/><br/>As in real football, the offensive player has four general options on each play: passing, running, punting or attempting a field goal.<br/><br/>In order for a pass play to be successful the offensive player must flick the ball, causing it to slide along the playing surface, ultimately contacting one of his own tokens. The player tokens consist of flat cardstock and when the ball token slides over top of them they tend to slide along with the ball token. When the ball stops sliding, if there is only an offensive player's token still caught underneath it, the play resulted in a pass completion. If there are one or more player tokens from each team, the pass was incomplete. If one or more tokens from the defensive team remain under the ball token, with no tokens from the offensive team, the pass was intercepted.<br/><br/>Running plays are not executed by sliding the ball. Instead both players secretly deploy their individual player tokens to any of the multiple eligible running lanes on the field. If the offensive player deployed his ball carrier to a running lane that was left unguarded by the defensive player, then he simply rolls three dice with the result being the number of yards gained on the play. If the lane is guarded by a defensive player, then both players roll a single die, and the yards gained (or lost) is determined by subtracting the defender's result from the offensive player's result.<br/><br/>Punting is performed by sliding the ball token down the field. If the ball slides into the endzone the receiving player can choose to start their drive at the 20-yard line, or attempt to return the punt by rolling dice to determine yardage.<br/><br/>Field goals are made by finger-flicking the ball token into the air and through a set of plastic uprights.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"230301": "English first edition"}, "age": "0", "name": "Action-Mat Football", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "4.5", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "153732": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2586949.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"7458": {"name": "Byron Collins"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"7458": "Byron Collins"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"8499": {"name": "Collins Epic Wargames"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2586949_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "The Spearpoint 1943: Eastern Front - Heavy Weapons Expansion adds all new Soviet and German &quot;heavies&quot; to the mix for the Spearpoint 1943 Eastern Front card wargame.

The game is divided into three ages, marked with different ship types. The first age is that of the galley, followed by the age of the galleon, then finally the steamship age. The board combines a track showing the development of ships, similar to that in Automobile, with a map of Europe and an area representing the rest of the world.<br/><br/>Your turn is divided into two phases. In the first phase, you choose to either conduct commerce (such as selling goods, taxing locations or improving your warehouse) or take a card, selecting one from seven on display; the cards vary in their effects, granting money, victory points or special actions.<br/><br/>In the second phase, you choose whether to place a ship, move a ship, or retrieve ships/merchants. When you place a ship, you do so in either the merchant box or the warship box in one of eleven levels. A merchant allows you to place a merchant cube on the board, giving you one or two goods counters to place in your warehouse. A warship lets you take control of a location at the cost of one food goods counter.<br/><br/>Once all of your ships are on the board, you can either move them (paying money to advance its level and take the associated action) or retrieve it from the board so that you can place it elsewhere later. As ships are placed in a level, the cost of placing in the next level reduces &mdash; until finally somebody is willing to pay the cost to place in that level (which earns bonus points and possible additional income). When a ship is placed in the first galleon level, galleys become redundant; similarly, someone placing in the first steamship level makes galleons redundant. During the galleon and steamship ages, you can pay extra to move more ships, so having money in hand gives you a greater range of options and allows you to use your fleet more efficiently.<br/><br/>When placing ships, you can initially place only in &quot;1&quot; locations, which are grouped around the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Once someone pays to move to a &quot;2&quot; location, which are grouped around the western Mediterranean, that area opens to others, with the other areas being Northern Europe (3), the Americas (4), East Indies (5) and the Pacific (6). As soon as a new area opens, players score points for merchants and control discs in the present area, with the points earned being the same as the number of the area.<br/><br/>Ships includes six types of goods: food, oil, metal, wine, cloth and spices. Each has a monetary value as well as a special power. Food can be used to take control of locations, thus building an empire. Oil can be used to gain extra actions. Metal helps to advance your ships along the outer track. Wine can be converted to goods of a lower value. Cloth can be converted to victory points, while spices have the highest monetary value. You have to decide whether to cash your goods in for money or use their power.<br/><br/>NOTE: this description is out-of-date.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"230316": "English limited edition"}, "name": "Ships", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "average": "7.00418", "usersrated": "834", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "age": "13"}, "153739": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Docks", "rpgproducer": {"24305": "Creighton Broadhurst"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1901985.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"230322": "PDF Version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"21950": "Urban Dressing"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1901985_t.png", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>Tired of your towns and cities being boring, bland places in which your PCs show little or no interest?

Instead of tracking your position on the track we track your position in the &quot;pack&quot;.<br/><br/>Machinas is our first card driven game that can be played by itself or added to any existing miniatures or RPG. Machinas is a stand alone game that can be used with any Post Apocalyptic rules, such as our own After the Horsemen.<br/><br/>All you need to play Machinas comes in one deck of cards and the rules. No track is needed and all you need to know to play the game is on the cards! You will have to provide a couple of everyday six-sided dice, but that's it.<br/><br/>Players customize their drivers and cars then race around the track. If you want you can race along highways and roadways in your favorite post apocalyptic setting, it's up to you.<br/><br/>Each driver has three Attributes - Savvy, Tech, and Speed and there's a wide variety of ways to customize your car. When the race starts each player keeps his cards out of sight until needed. Once played the cards are laid out for all to see. This keeps the customization of your car a secret until it is revealed.<br/><br/>But customizing your car and driver is just the beginning.<br/><br/>During the race you have to plan your strategy and tactics. When do you sit back and when do you make your move? Do you try and shoot up your opponents or make dramatic two car passes? Machinas is much more than rolling dice and the drivers with the the right strategy and good tactics will win.<br/><br/>Machinas is a perfect one-off pickup game, easy to learn and fun to play.

Having no children of his own issue, any claim to his rather sizable fortune must issue from his legal will.  Unfortunately the Baron not only wrote many different wills in the last years of his life, it seems he tore them all to shreds.  The six known claimants have been given twelve hours to prove their rights to inherit.  As one of these claimants, you must search the Baron&rsquo;s country manor to find fragments of the will which name you as heir.<br/><br/>Would that it were only that simple.<br/><br/>The other potential heirs are collecting their claims as well, and there&rsquo;s nothing to stop them from picking up your fragments to keep you from having them.  Some might even stoop so low as to steal claims you&rsquo;ve already gathered!  Keep in mind that opportunities also exist for collaboration, however, and that a winning strategy often includes working with your opponents when the time is right.<br/><br/>As if the competing heirs weren&rsquo;t enough to complicate your efforts, the End itself is an ode to the many peculiarities of the Redmayne family.  An ancient structure, expanded and updated haphazardly many times over the centuries, even the oldest members of the staff know only a portion of its secrets.  These individuals are key to your success, providing invaluable aid not merely in collecting your claims but also in successfully traversing the dangers of the house which may at times seem an implacable opponent.

It is played upon a board laid out in squares or rectangles, and the pieces employed represent and symbolize the important men and weapons of warfare, while their movements simulate the military evolutions of two armies opposed in battle, advancing, retreating and engaging in the diverse methods that characterize actual warfare, and employing all the various forms of strategy.<br/><br/>Each side, as a fighting force, comprises a king, a commanding officer, field and siege artillery, cavalry and ordinary troops and flying machines.<br/><br/>All the movements of Chess are found in the game, and, in addition, the troops have the movements made familiar in checkers or draughts, while some pieces are given different moves, and more freedom of movement than in either Chess or Checkers. But while these two games are thus drawn on to contribute all their virtues, the vital principle of The Game of War is radically different and wholly new.<br/><br/>In Chess the game is won when a player so hems in his adversary's king that it cannot escape capture; in Checkers all of the adversary's pieces must be captured and taken from the board, or the last of them penned, to secure a victory.<br/><br/>In The Game of War, however, the object is to lay siege to and capture the citadel &mdash; a central square in the king's rank on which the ruler is stationed at the outset of the game. When an adversary's piece can enter and hold this square without being captured at the next move, such occupancy of the citadel wins the game.<br/><br/>Chief of the many other distinctive features in The Game of War is the introduction of two flying machines on each side. The purpose and the movements of these are wholly novel, and give a singular fascination to the playing of the game. Moreover, the board used in the game is of a new design, having one hundred squares, instead of sixty-four, as in chess and checkers, and the all-important citadel square stands forth in battlemented prominence.

Push and rout enemy lines. Coordinate allied attacks to secure victory, but watch your flanks!<br/><br/>Nika, inspired by ancient Greek geography &amp; warfare, is based around two core mechanisms: facing and formations. Pieces can be routed off the board if attacked from the side or back, but not from the front. A routed piece can rally back onto the board at the cost of an action. Your pieces can move or rotate together in a phalanx if they are adjacent and facing the same way, and you can push back enemies facing you if your phalanx is deeper than theirs.<br/><br/>There are four cities: Athens (white) and Messene (blue) are allied against Sparta (red) and Thebes (black). Allies start across the board from each other, and you win by getting a piece into your victory area in the heart of your ally's territory. Each two-city alliance can be played either solo or with a partner, so the game can support two, three, or four players.<br/><br/>Every player has enemies on both sides, making the distribution of both pieces and actions between fronts a strategic and often tactical consideration. Maneuvering, timing, coordination, and sacrifice are all key elements of strategy.<br/><br/>Says designer Josh Raab, &quot;Nika is the ancient Greek word for 'conquer'. The concept of Nika came to me in a dream while I was studying abroad in Athens. The rules were honed across nearly two years of testing. The board shape and core mechanics were inspired by ancient Greek geography and warfare. Greece has many narrow valleys and mountain passes, and sometimes the only way to defeat an enemy force was to collide with them head-on and literally push them off the field. This othismos ('shoving') is thought to have been the critical phase of most battles between hoplite armies, who were the heavy infantry that dominated ancient Greek war for four centuries.&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"230345": "English first edition"}, "average": "6.67349", "name": "Nika", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2676": "Grid Movement"}, "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "83", "boardgameaccessory": {"171632": "Nika: Corinthian Helmet Turn Marker"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "153758": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1902902.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"46412": {"name": "Alex Davy"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"43502": "Lin Bo"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2973": {"name": "Edge Entertainment"}}, "maxplaytime": "150", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1902902_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "150", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "description": "Nemesis, the first expansion for Relic, introduces player-versus-player combat to the board game in an optional new &quot;Enemies of the Imperium&quot; game mode; in this mode, up to two players play as Nemeses, such as a World Eaters Berserker or a Eldar Dire Avenger, instead of characters.

Each player moves one of his meeples according to the sum of the number of his own disks and those of the player on his right side. If a meeple lands on a space with a red dot, it has to start again (There are a lot of red dots!). If it lands on a red cross, it is eliminated from the game. Landing on a green space means that the meeple has prematurely reached the finish line.<br/><br/>"}, "153762": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2012180.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"194950": "The Pyramid of the Flying Marbles"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"9393": {"name": "N\u00e9stor Romeral Andr\u00e9s"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "3", "boardgameartist": {"73060": "Viole Rodrigo"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"10094": {"name": "nestorgames"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2012180_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "description": "Feudal Japan.

Hill tiles act as tie-breakers: if two or more players occupy the same feature equally (a &quot;shared majority&quot;), but one of the tied players has a follower standing on a hill tile, that player will have an advantage over the others, and will score all the points for that feature.<br/><br/>Vineyards are designed to increase the importance of monasteries. Each vineyard tile placed around a monastery adds three points to that monastery's score. However, these bonus points only count if the monastery is completed, so players are more likely to sabotage their opponents' monasteries in order to prevent them from being finished.<br/><br/>Shepherds are new pieces that can only be placed in fields. Each time a player expands the field occupied by his or her shepherd, that player has two options: 1. Draw a sheep token out of a bag, placing it near their shepherd; or 2. Trade in all their accumulated sheep for points. Each sheep token is worth 1-4 points, depending on the number of sheep depicted. However, hidden among the sheep tokens are two wolf tokens, and if a player draws one of these, all of their sheep are lost and placed back into the bag. This introduces a push-your-luck aspect to Carcassonne, as players can choose to either &quot;cash-in&quot; the sheep they have, or try to add more sheep and risk losing them all.<br/><br/>The goal of Hills &amp; Sheep remains the same as in basic Carcassonne: claim the most points to win the game.

Well, it's easier than it seems. All you need is a personal planet, several billions of faithful yet simple-minded minions (preferably small-sized and green-skinned) and a dozen of cunning plans. Or two dozens for your own piece of mind. Who are your archrivals? No superheroes I assure you as they are just mythic figures from graphic novels. So, you should beware your competitors, other villains who are eager to add the prefix super to their proud title.<br/><br/>Today becoming the Supervillain is even simpler than ever! A new boardgame by Right Games and Anton Lozovskiy provides you with everything you need for this fascinating activity. But for opponents &mdash; I assume every self-respecting villain must have some.<br/><br/>Become Supervillain is a boardgame for two&mdash;five players aged 12+. While competing for the title of the principal anti-hero, players spend their minions to complete secret projects, spin vicious intrigues and shatter opponents' plans with meteorites. You must be first to collect secret projects valued 5,000 points to win the game. Besides, the game can end earlier if all plan cards have been drawn. Then a player with overall maximum points becomes the Supervillain.<br/><br/>There're two types of cards: plans (they are also secret projects and meteorites) and intrigues (they are also minions). Before the game starts, cards are shuffled into two separate decks and each player draws two intrigues. At turn's start, the active player draws a card from each deck, puts the intrigue in his/her hand and decides what to do with the plan card either by playing it face-up as a plan or face-down as a meteorite. To complete plans you need minions: as soon as the total value of minions on one of your plans become equal or exceed its cost, it becomes the secret project and yields victory points. Often it also gives you special abilities. If you don't want to handle some plan, you may turn it into a meteorite and send at somebody as a valuable gift. Then the card is put face-down with the arrow pointing at your victim. The latter has time before your next turn to deal with the flying meteorite (some intrigues allow shooting them down or even redirecting them). If your meteorite has successfully hit the victim, you draw an extra card from the deck and &mdash; the most important &mdash; destroy a minion on any of his/her plans.<br/><br/>Intrigue cards can also be played in two ways. First &mdash; as an intrigue itself, in accordance with its text. Their effects are versatile and cunning as true villain's thoughts: take cards from opponents, charge meteorites, protect yourself, accelerate plans, etc. Second &mdash; as a minion, by placing it on your plan (its value is indicated in the upper part of the card). During your turn you may play only one intrigue and one minion or just keep them for some better time.<br/><br/>Become Supervillain is a speedy and funny parody boardgame with simple rules and lively gameplay. It learns not only to be cunning and vicious but also to shatter other villains' plans. Finally, if our world has to face the Supervillain, let it be you and not some thorough scoundrel.<br/><br/>"}, "153789": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1904524.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3294": {"name": "Franck Yeghicheyan"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "1", "boardgameartist": {"42946": "Christophe Camilotte"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"540": {"name": "Vae Victis"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1904524_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1069": {"name": "Modern Warfare"}}, "description": "Op&eacute;ration &quot;Bruno&quot; (Operation &quot;Bruno&quot;) retraces the odyssey of the (French) 6th Colonial Parachute Battalion (6eme bataillon de parachutistes coloniaux - 6&eacute;me BPC) across 80 km of jungle with the Viet Minh troops on their heels, following the combats in Tu Le.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>     A3 map<br/>     108 die-cut counters<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The game requires a six-sided die.<br/><br/>Available with French rules, but English rules can be downloaded from the Vae Victis website.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"230398": "Vae Victis edition"}, "age": "0", "name": "Indochine 1952: Op\u00e9ration \"Bruno\"", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "6.14286", "usersrated": "14", "boardgamefamily": {"9825": "Magazine: Vae Victis"}}, "153790": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1904816.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"73098": {"name": "Pierre Krebs"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2003", "maxplayers": "12", "boardgameartist": {"73109": "Brigitte Ehrhardt"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"26539": {"name": "Original Games (Board Game)"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1904816_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1082": {"name": "Mythology"}}, "description": "In French, from the back of the box :<br/>&quot;Jouez avec votre signe astrologique<br/><br/>+  de 1000 questions, pr&eacute;dictions et d&eacute;fis<br/><br/>6 th&egrave;mes : Amis, Amour, Argent, Chance, Energie, Travail<br/>R&eacute;pondez, devinez, tentez la chance et...<br/>provoquez vos adversaires : bataille de d&eacute;, bluff...<br/>Gagnez en &eacute;tant le 1er &agrave; faire le tour des 12 signes !&quot;<br/><br/>In English :<br/>&quot;Play with your astrological sign<br/>More than 1000 questions, predictions and challenges<br/>6 topics : Friends, Love, Money, Luck, Energy, Work<br/>Answer, guess, try your luck and...<br/>challenge your opponents : dice battle, bluff...<br/>Win the game by being the 1st to complete your round of 12 signs&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"230399": "French edition"}, "age": "9", "name": "Horoscope: le jeu", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"28717": "Astrology"}}, "153791": {"poll": {}, "name": "En Prise Chess Cards", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"4024": "Chess Games"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1903815_t.jpg", "average": "4.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"26533": {"name": "The En Prise Card Company Ltd"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1903815.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"230401": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "3", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "En Prise is a card game of chance and strategy that plays just like chess - for two to four players.  No separate board or pieces are required as the cards themselves represent squares of a growing board that takes shape as the game progresses.  A deck consists of 64 cards.  Each player uses 16 cards, matching the pieces and pawns of a standard chess set. They can choose one of four colours (white, black, red and blue).<br/><br/>Cards are dealt, face-up, into shuffled 'Battleplans' from which cards are played, in the shuffled order, into a central playing area.  Each card represents a square of a chess board.  A square can be occupied (card face-up) or unoccupied (face-down).  On each turn, a card is either placed as a piece/pawn or empty square; or moved according to traditional chess movement rules &ndash; but they can only move within the board squares already created.  When a card is placed (a new square), it must be connected to an existing square of the board.  When a card moves, it is swapped with the destination card so the growing board is preserved.<br/><br/>Kings can be placed on any turn where there are at least six empty squares on the board.  If a player chooses to do so, all opponents must use their next turn to place their King.  The aim of En Prise, like chess,  is to checkmate opposing Kings.  When a player is checkmated, their board cards are turned over to become empty squares on their next turn.  The winner is the last remaining player.<br/><br/>Variations described in the rules include En Prise Casino, En Prise Alliance, En Prise Memory and En Prise Blind.<br/><br/>"}, "153792": {"rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Cavern: Evil Shrines", "rpgproducer": {"72892": "J.

Action takes place in a fantasy world of Eador which is broken into pieces of a past holistic world, surfing across the Astral. Players take roles of the Masters, mighty demigods, trying to subordinate as many Eador shards as possible. They forward armies to conquer new territories, cast spells and perform powerful rituals.<br/><br/>The board game suits for 2-6 players but it&rsquo;s mostly comfortable to play for at least 4 players. All players get their Master cards at the game start &ndash; such cards exist not only for the atmosphere, they also help to settle some controversies. 12-18 shard cards (amount depends on the number of players) are mixed up to a separate pile and the game is over when this pile flows out. There are always two shard cards on the table, the one for the current round and another for the next &ndash; it helps players to plan their moves concentrating on the shards which are easier to get. Shard conquering is performed by playing action cards; there are more then 100 of them &ndash; armies, spells and rituals. At the game beginning everyone gets 7 action cards to the hand. Usually it&rsquo;s possible to add only one more card during the turn so using them should be careful. Rituals are the cards with especially strong features letting, for example, to take more action cards, take someone else&rsquo;s action or shard cards, to gain more winning points. Player can&rsquo;t fight for the chard during the turn if he performs a ritual but these cards give him further advantage.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the round each player decides if he will fight for the current shard or not. You need to play an army or a spell card to join a battle. The most important feature of the army is its power. Also there are the type of the army on the card (Light, Chaos or neutral), its class (warrior, monster, magician or undead) and nature of the ground (hills, swamps, plains, forests). Armies and some spells stay in the battle to the end of the round, some spells work only for the round they were played at. The result of the battle round is counted when all players interested in the shard have made their moves. The owner of the strongest army gets authority points counters according to his advantage above the second contender. Players can give up from the second turn and leave the battle. In this case they can&rsquo;t play armies or spells anymore for the current battle but still have a chance to win if nobody acquires more authority points. When all players pass the battle ends and the shard goes to the player who gained maximum authority points.<br/><br/>Each battle has some pieces of subtleties. Firstly, it&rsquo;s impossible to play Light and Chaos armies without a special card. Secondly, all the shards are different: some of them give advantages to defined type or class of armies or restrict using them, others allow to play two armies in a round. Thirdly, all armies fighting for the shard at the &ldquo;native&rdquo; land get extra strength. Attentive player will get a big profit considering all these features. When battle for the last shard is over players count their winning points on their conquered shards and performed rituals. That sum shows the winner.<br/><br/>The game for two or three players differs &ndash; they get 3 or 2 Master cards and make more actions during the round &ndash; to play a ritual and take part in the battle.<br/><br/>"}, "153846": {"rpg": {"23864": "Lords of Gossamer & Shadow"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Brokeworld", "rpgproducer": {"42101": "James Hazelett"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1904713.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": {"230480": "PDF version"}, "average": "8", "rpgissuearticle": {"120360": "Gossamer Worlds: Brokeworld"}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "rpgseries": {"24728": "Gossamer Worlds"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1904713_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The Grand Stair stretches behind the scenes of the multiverse,<br/>the Doors upon its unfathomably vast span leading the way to gossamer worlds of limitless variety and infinite possibility.

La Revoluci&oacute;n Francesa, a finales del siglo XVIII, hab&iacute;a supuesto un cambio en la concepci&oacute;n de la estructura de la sociedad y muchos derechos y privilegios tradicionales se estaban poniendo en duda. Estas ideas revolucionarias recorrieron Europa y convirtieron a Francia en un peligro para los gobiernos m&aacute;s tradicionales. La presi&oacute;n de estos gobiernos favoreci&oacute; la llegada al poder de Napole&oacute;n y con &eacute;l un r&eacute;gimen pol&iacute;tico bastante opuesto a las ideas liberales de la Revoluci&oacute;n Francesa, pero bastante efectivo militarmente para enfrentarse y derrotar a casi todos sus enemigos. S&oacute;lo Gran Breta&ntilde;a parec&iacute;a resistir los envites de Napole&oacute;n y fruto de su juego pol&iacute;tico, militar y diplom&aacute;tico, Espa&ntilde;a y Portugal se vieron envueltos en una guerra que en su mayor parte se desarrollar&iacute;a sobre la pen&iacute;nsula. La sociedad espa&ntilde;ola se divide en tras bandos: los absolutistas que cre&iacute;an que Fernando deb&iacute;a seguir gobernando Espa&ntilde;a como hasta entonces, los afrancesados que pensaban que los cambios que provocar&iacute;a un gobierno franc&eacute;s ser&iacute;an mejores que seguir con el gobierno anterior y los liberales que cre&iacute;an que tanto absolutistas como Napole&oacute;n representaban el pasado y que hab&iacute;a llegado el momento de hacer nuestra propia Revoluci&oacute;n Francesa.

The French Revolution in the late eighteenth century had wrought a change in the concept of the structure of society and many traditional rights and privileges were being questioned. These revolutionary ideas spread out of France across Europe France and became a danger to the more traditional governments. Pressure from these governments favored the rise to power of Napoleon as he seemed quite opposite to the liberal ideas of the French Revolution political regime.  But his rise made France quite effective militarily to confront and defeat almost all enemies.  Only Britain seemed to resist the stakes of Napoleon, and the result of its political, military and diplomatic efforts were that Spain and Portugal became embroiled in a war that would develop over almost the entire Iberian peninsula.<br/><br/>In this game, the Spanish society is divided into the following camps: <br/><br/>     those who believed that absolutist Fernando Spain should continue to govern as before, <br/>     the Francophile who thought the changes caused by the French government would be better to continue with the previous government, and <br/>     liberals who believed that the absolutist Napoleon represented the past and the time to make our own version of the French revolution had arrived. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>These three schools of thought would face off politically and militarily for several years, creating suggestive gaming situations for starting roles: palace intrigues, skirmishes, pitched battles, etc.<br/><br/>"}, "153869": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "name": "Teufelsrad", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1904913_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"26532": {"name": "Der Spielkasten"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1904913.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"230508": "Spielkasten edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "poll": {}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Each player gets 3 meeples, which he has to move from the starting space to the center of the game board.

The building is located in what now is the outskirts of the small town East Dereham, about 15 miles east of Norwich. It is the oldest building in the village, and it was first recorded in books in the early sixteens century. The basement is much older than that, and it do contain a secret that has been well kept since the days of Merlin and Arthur. Hidden in the basement behind a well hidden secret door, is a catacomb where a fallen has been trapped. Powerful magic seals of the area and even blocks any paranormal abilities to detect the presence of a fallen.<br/><br/>Over the centuries, many children have discovered the secret door in search for adventure and unknowingly wandered into the catacomb. Those moments have ended in disasters, and three times have the house been burnt down, leaving only the stone bedrock, In every fire many people have died, but never enough people to give the fallen power enough to break the seal that keeps him locked in here. The house have then been rebuilt after each fire, while the fallen have still been trapped deep below. The fallen is not physically trapped, but can only leave the catacombs for a short period of time, using a controlled body. To leave the place for good, a powerful ritual has to take place, which requires a large amount of dead people to break the bond locking his spiritual form to this very place.<br/><br/>Back to the present time. For the past two months, whole families have been disappearing from the small town of East Dereham. It all began when the young boy Allister Clarke went missing, and a few days later his family.

Scotland Yard put their best man on the job, Detective Inspector Sir Henry Porter, but after three weeks and several families gone missing, the Yard have turned over the case, first to M.I.5, then it ended up on the desk of the commander of Operation: Fallen Reich. --&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "153878": {"rpg": {"4552": "Operation: Fallen Reich"}, "poll": {}, "name": "A Merry Christmas", "rpgproducer": {"38909": "Totte Alm"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1905291.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"230520": "PDF Version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"178": "Crime (Mystery / Detective / Noir)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"24385": "Lurking Dangers"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1905291_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>This is an adventure for the RPG Operation: Fallen Reich, for 4 players.<br/><br/>This is a short adventure suitable for a 2-3 hour game, starting anywhere in England, December 22, 1937.<br/><br/>Plot Excerpt:<br/><br/>&quot;In the early 1930s in Montpelier, France, the eccentric professor in parapsychology Claude Bousquet, was expelled from the university&rsquo;s research department after a tragic accident involving several students who was either killed or severely injured.

Then they deal out four cards face-up next to it.

Players can play a card higher, or lower than whatever number is showing on the top of any given pile, but they do need to be sure to match the color of the pile. Also, players can place a wild card on any pile and announce a number, and a color, and then play a card higher or lower than the number they called, in the new color on that pile.<br/><br/>The speed and excitement build until someone who has played all of their down pile shouts &quot;Flip Flash!&quot; and everyone must stop. Next, the players gather and sort all of the cards that have been played in the center of the table and sort them, so that each player can count up how many cards they played. The score is figured by taking the number of cards that were played, and subtracting double the number of cards that were still in each players down pile.<br/><br/>WHAT MAKES FLIP FLASH DIFFERENT:<br/>The ability to play up or down on the number piles, and the wild card twist, speed up the game by making sure that you rarely stay stuck for long! The number piles are never capped off, or removed from play during a round, and players flip through their hand-deck one card at a time.

Creator Pedro &ldquo;Reynard&rdquo; Loustaunau first started with a very serious game concept and quickly found it to be lame. After realizing it needed a sillier tone, he quickly went from &ldquo;a little bit lighthearted&rdquo; to &ldquo;quite a bit silly&rdquo; as he realized Jan&rsquo;s art would be perfect for his new vision of the game. Having found his ad in the programming schedule for Anthrocon 2011, Reynard contacted Jan with his crazy idea for him to become Lead Artist for the project. The ad pointed to Swords and Sausages (now Reynard&rsquo;s favorite webcomic), which showcased Jan&rsquo;s vibrant imagination and his talents as an artist.<br/><br/>Jan quickly became the Lead Artist for Tails and Tactics and development continued for almost two years before finally releasing at Anthrocon 2013. Thanks to the pledges of many wonderful people on IndieGoGo, Series 1 of Tails and Tactics became a reality.<br/><br/>Objective of the Game:<br/>To win. Duh.<br/>In order to do that, though, you must fight through your opponent's front line and attack his or her base enough to deplete its health to 0 - before they do so to you.<br/>Each player begins the game with 30 Base Health. Base Health is lost when a unit controlled by an opposing player attacks your base (represented by you, the player). They may only do so, though, when you have no units on the field to defend with. If you do have units on the field that are able to defend, opponents must remove them before being able to attack your base directly.<br/>1 base health is lost per attack, no matter how powerful (or weak) the attacking unit is.

This is not obvious. Instead, it appears to be square due to the commonplace elongation of the diagonal dimension and/or shortening of the orthogonal dimension which is the universal convention for representing them.<br/>This implicates why a perfect mapping onto the surface of a 3-D sphere, from a circle rather than a square, is ideally suitable and achievable.]<br/><br/>Fortunately, the players are not required to deal with any complex, confusing 3-D curvature characteristic to a spherical playing surface.<br/><br/>This is the advantage to using flat 2-D representations of a spherical-surface, 3-D chess variant.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"230659": "First edition"}, "age": "0", "name": "Spherical Chess 324", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2676": "Grid Movement"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"4024": "Chess Games"}}, "153977": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1910213.jpg", "poll": {}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamecompilation": {"153975": "Zombicide Survivor: Thiago"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamepublisher": {"21608": {"name": "CMON Limited"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1910213_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "Black Friday is about danger and power.

It's Yahtzee, meets Uno, meets Parcheesi!<br/><br/>Mice &amp; Dice is a family-friendly game that is fun for all ages! Choose or roll your number (d6) in the beginning of the game. If YOU roll your number on your turn, you get 2 points. If anyone else rolls your number on THEIR turn, you get 1 point. Every 5 points that you obtain you get to roll an extra dice (starting with one, max of 5). If anyone, including you, ever rolls your number two times or more you get to choose a mice or rat card. Mice cards help you, Rat cards hurt other players (i.e. Fat Rat- Roll 1 less die). After scoring 25 points, you enter the cheese phase where you then have the option of pulling cheese cards if more than one of your number is rolled. Cheese cards give you extra points based on the cheese card.

The person to get back &quot;home&quot; first scores 5 points, the others scoring one point for each site of interest reached. The overall winner is the person with most points at the end of the pre-agreed number of rounds.<br/><br/>The board is made up of a hexagonal base, overprinted with the main rail routes, stations and places of interest (that the players must visit). Each round has a different theme - shopping centres, scenic locations, sports stadia, etc. Players roll two dice if they want to travel by train or subway, and one die if travelling by bus. Certain die rolls will result in &quot;incident&quot; cards, which may force a detour, a missed turn etc.<br/><br/>2-6 players, but best with 3-4.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>Game Board<br/>Rules (1p)<br/>2 6-sided dice<br/>8 Hexagonal plastic playing pieces with a Bus on one face, and a Train on the opposite<br/>30 Destination Cards<br/>14 Rail Incident Cards<br/>14 Bus Incident Cards<br/><br/>"}, "153999": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2621938.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"73154": {"name": "David Chircop"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"12691": "Marie Cardouat"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"24881": {"name": "LudiCreations"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2621938_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"26784": "2014 Golden Geek Best Print & Play Board Game Nominee"}, "description": "...and then we held hands. is a co-operative game about finding balance.

Other valid Yushino sequences are 875, since 8 + 7 =(1)5; 7291, as 7 + 2 = 9 and 2 + 9 = (1)1, etc.<br/><br/>Second rule:<br/>If the sequence has 2 numbers, the numbers must differ by 1 - but keep in mind that the numbers repeat, so we go from 0 to 9 and then back to 0 again, which means that 9 is next to 8 but it is also next to 0. Examples of valid two-number sequences are: 56, 87, 90, 09, 98, etc.<br/><br/>"}, "153523": {"average": "5.29167", "poll": {}, "name": "Welt der Spiele", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "12", "boardgamefamily": {"21393": "Welt des"}, "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1902796_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"51438": "Sabine Kondirolli"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3490": {"name": "HUCH!"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1902796.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"229931": "German first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1027": {"name": "Trivia"}}, "age": "14", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>What picture exists in the card game Tarot?

Moreover, the winner will gain interplanetary fame as for the first time in the Grand Bug Races, robobugs from the space station will participate in the next stage of the competition.<br/><br/>Bug Race is an easy to master but still captivates as a dynamic board game race for 2-4 players  from 8 years old. Each player leads his own bug to victory moving its legs one after another. Of course, legs shouldn&rsquo;t be torn off the body or tangle with each other. When a bug passes all 9 levels of the playing field and crosses the finish line first, its owner wins the game.<br/><br/>Each bug consists of 7 elements, body and 6 legs, and runs at its own track, divided into sections. There are special notches for the bug&rsquo;s legs, gashed on the each side of the track. Body, that covers three sections, is placed at the track between the legs. &ldquo;Losing&rdquo; legs is permitted: each leg should touch the body at least diagonally all the time. So the bug can not stretch for more than 5 sections.<br/><br/>When the game begins, players place their bugs at the start positions &ndash; the three first sections of the track. Tracks cross at the middle of the table and connected by the central element with the race aim on it. They are not bonded hard so players don&rsquo;t pull others&rsquo; tracks while moving their own bugs. If needed, in case of lack of free space on the table for example, playing is possible without a center element. And of cause you don&rsquo;t need extra tracks if there are less than 4 players.<br/><br/>Moving bugs is performed by using special cards. Each of them allows to move 2 or 3 legs, a front left and a middle right, for example. In the beginning of each round players draw two of such cards from the stack. One of them stays at the hand and another one goes to the next player. Then both cards in the hand should be played in any order. Player moves all the stated legs forward if there is a free notch and the leg won&rsquo;t be torn off the body. It&rsquo;s possible to move the bug&rsquo;s body forward as well at any time during the turn if it won&rsquo;t cause a leg loss.<br/><br/>When everyone finish playing cards &ndash; by verbal understanding cards can be played all at the same time or by turns &ndash; players discard them and draw the new ones. The game is over when at least one bug has passed the finish line by its body, which should be located at the three last track sections. If such a bug is the only one, its owner wins the game. If there are several challengers, the winner is defined by the location of legs.<br/><br/>Skillful players can play 4 cards instead of 2 during the turn. In that case each player draws 4 cards from the stack, leaves one in the hand and gives three to the next player, chooses one from the derived cards and gives two, and at last gives one and keeps another. By the way, players can choose the convenient design: there is a forest glade with an apple at the one side and a space station with a big red button at the other. Bugs are also two-sided, well-matched to the game field. Of cause, nothing impedes robot-bugs to land on the Earth as well as common insects can visit a space station, it will be even more interesting.<br/><br/>"}, "153572": {"statistics": {}, "name": "& (Issue 7 - Winter 2013)", "rpgproducer": {"24925": "Andreas Claren"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1896174.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"21951": "& Magazine"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"110892": "Archer / Archer-Ranger PC Class"}, "rpg": {"13236": "AD&D First Edition (1e) Compatible Products"}, "rpgissueversion": {"230017": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1896174_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>The &amp; Publishing Group announces their seventh issue, an issue focused on the Inner Planes.

This is a war type fighting game utilizing cards and dice. Unique game mechanics, multiple target options, independent enemies and allies and battlefield teleportation makes AD an amazing card game experience to be enjoyed by hard core card gamers as well as the casual gamer alike.<br/><br/>Champion abilities are totally unique to the powers they have.  What does that mean? Take for example the blood champion, her power and power beasts cards will have different effects from those of different champions.  She has combo type power cards where as the water champion has evolution type power cards.  Another example is the fire champion having preload damage type power cards(Preload is a type of card where you use currency to determine the time or damage a card will perform before its played) where as the imagination champion will be very location specific.  All that to say, skilled play will be vital to winning, not just having the best cards.<br/><br/>Awaken Destruction will give you all the tools you need to build a great deck to start and you compete to make them stronger. There are no additional packs to buy after the initial purchase unless a champion update comes out. Your starter deck will have the maximum number of each card your champion can have and then you can tailor it down to your style of game play. There is no random card pack selling going on in AD. If a champion update is released, you will know every single card in that update before you buy it.  We feel this method allows players to spend more time playing and less time spending.<br/><br/>You haven't played a card game like this before. I never played TCGs prior to designing AD. When I created this, I had no idea what was already out on the market or what had come before me.  I created a game I felt would be very fun to play,  a skill based game that rewards a players abilitiy to think and adapt changing strategies as they play.  You are not out of this game just because you are down at the moment.  Cards and luck can change in an instant. Its kind of an emotional rollercoaster at times.  Ive been down and out for what I thought was a no win senario and the independant enemies came in and rocked the other player and gave me that little window of hope that I was able to use to finish the match.  On the other hand, I been in games where I thought I had it in the bag and and I few heals from killing bonuses and the other player was right back in the game, so you never really know how it's gonna turn out.  Which is why having the ability to adapt different play styles mid-game is going to be what seperates the good players from the great ones.      <br/><br/><br/>"}, "153582": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Wyvern (Issue 1 - Jul 2006)", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1896966.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"24352": "Wyvern"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"111042": "Bazaar"}, "rpgissueversion": {"230039": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1896966_t.jpg", "description": "The first issue of Wyvern magazine produced.

For that, you can turn to a mythic heritage. This new aspect of mythic characters allows for further customization of your mythic character. A mythic character can choose a mythic heritage in addition to his or her mythic path, and doing so grants him access to a number of unique abilities that are designed to reflect the flavor of his heritage, while also being of value to characters of every mythic path.<br/><br/>This installment explores the demonic heritage, and characters whose mythic power comes from demons, the abyss, or similar sources of evil and chaos. Whether your ancestor was a demon prince, your powers come from a profane ritual that you were exposed to as a child, or you&rsquo;re simply tainted in some way by the foul presence of the abyss, this mythic heritage allows you to tap into that dark power. The book includes 17 new mythic abilities, all of which are part of the demonic mythic heritage. Summon mythic demons to aid you in combat, wield a balor&rsquo;s flaming whip, tempt mortals with promises of power, and render yourself immune to anything that would target your black and shriveled soul. This is the power of the abyss, and it can be yours to command.<br/><br/>"}}
