This is Crescendo of Doom... a gripping game of tactical combat set against the seemingly invincible juggernauts of war-torn Europe. Setting the scene for the colossal struggle of the titans which will follow, Crescendo is, nonetheless, far more than a simple prelude to Barbarossa. While fur&shy;ther refining the innovations brought forth in its highly successful predecessors Squad Leader and Cross of Iron, Crescendo breaks yet even more ground in the realm of realistic tactical combat without disturbing the underlying basic simplicity of a universally acclaimed game system.

Complete armor, ordnance, and infantry units are provided for Poland, Belgium, Finland. and a host of other minor neutrals including Elite, Line, and Reservist formations for all nationalities. In graphic detail far superior to any narrative account, you will see for yourself how the outnumbered German panzers defeated the superior armor of the French tanks.

As an expansion, much of the 1984 edition of Axis &amp; Allies was needed to play this expansion.<br/><br/>The World at War 1939-1945 2nd Edition, published in 1993, balanced some of the gameplay and added some new ideas but retained the same glossy 24&quot;x36&quot; color map and pieces.<br/><br/>The 3rd Edition, published in 1996, continued to improve gameplay balance and added Atomic Bombs to the technology development. After developing A-bomb technology, players spend 6 IPCs to buy one, which must be delivered via a Heavy Bomber (also a required technology). Damage to a land or sea zone by an A-bomb eliminates 20 IPCs worth of enemy units and renders the territory desolate (-5 IPC value, with +1 restoration each turn for two turns), causing devastation to the economy as well as military of an opposing player.<br/><br/>Now in its 4th edition, The World at War includes a hardback map (replacing the poster-paper map of earlier editions), with some minor rule revisions over the 3rd ed, and this is a mature game in it's own right with differences significant enough for any A&amp;A fan to appreciate, beyond all of the &quot;official&quot; editions published in recent years.<br/><br/>There are new unit types, such as Destoyers, Paratroopers, SS Panzers and SS Panzergrenadiers, Russian Guards, Partisans.

After the first segment of a turn, only towers made of two game pieces may be moved. Each tower is broken down during its move, and one of its pieces may be used to build a new tower on another square. Intelligent use of this move technique can lead to &quot;nuclear chain reactions&quot;, in which up to five towers are involved. There must never be more than one tower on the board at one time. Any tower on the board must be moved during the following turn segment by the player whose piece is on top. The game ends with the achievement of an agreed-upon number of points.<br/><br/>The game was originally published in 1989 in a tiny cardboard box by Ferdinand de Cassan.

It is packaged in a slipcase box that includes one 60 x 52 cm map, 240 full-color die cut counters, one standard and scenario rules booklet, one historical commentary booklet, and two player aid cards.  Game turns are one year each: after collecting silver and/or receiving it from Rome, you can pay your troops, recruit tribal levies, and perform other administrative functions. After that comes the Operations Phase. During it, each force (one or more Field Armies, Tribal Levies, etc) can perform certain operations, using Operation Points (OP). These actions include combat, diplomacy (you can try to control any area through diplomacy), besiege cities, pillage, recruit mercenaries, or build colonies. At the end of the Operations Phase, forces retire to winter quarters.<br/><br/>The most outstanding features of the game are the Prestige Point Level and the differences between Regular and Irregular warfare.  The Prestige Level (PP) simulates the prestige of the civilized armies (Punic, Romans, Sertorians) among the Iberian tribes, and the tendency of the latter to switch to the side that seems to be winning... Certain results of the CRTs add or decrease the PP level of each side. Then, if your PP level is above 2, you have positive die roll modifiers on the Diplomacy Table. And vice versa if your PP level is 0 or lower.  Leaders play a key role since their modifiers are applied to retreat before combat, diplomacy, all kinds of combat, operations, interception, etc. Leaders are rated for Military and Diplomatic skills (The highest is Sertorius, with +3 +3). Roman leaders (Praetors, one each for Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior) are changed randomly each year when they're elected by the Senate of Rome. If you have quality leaders, your chances of avoid/provoke combat are higher, and vice versa.<br/><br/>The irregular, &quot;hit and run&quot; tactics of the inhabitants of the peninsula characterized the Roman conquest and were the cause why the Romans took 200 years to completely control all of Hispania. All combat units have Regular and Irregular Combat factors. The attacker can always choose which CRT he is going to use. The idea here was to simulate the asymmetrical war fought out between the Roman/Punic invaders and the native peoples. If you can impose your style of fighting, (the other can not avoid combat) then you have the edge over the enemy.<br/><br/>The game is played in scenarios. There are 9, from the Punic reconquest of Iberia (237-221 BCE) to the Cantabria campaigns of Caesar Augustus (24-19 BCE). There are a set of common rules for all the scenarios, plus specific rules for each scenario. There are fast playing scenarios (such as the Roman Civil War, or the Cantabrian wars) that can be played in two-three hours, and other that take 6-10 hour of play (up to 17 turns, such as Cato's campaign of 195 BCE, or the II Lusitanian War).<br/><br/>Each scenario has its own Random Events Table. Some of the Random Events included are: plague, Excellent/Bad Crops, Tribal Rebellions galore, bribing enemy mercenaries, Numidian rebellion (for the II Punic War scenario), Alliance with Mithridates (Sertorius War scenario), and more.<br/><br/>Optional rules include assassination of enemy leaders (you must spend Operations Points and Treasury Points for that), Rivalry between Iberian tribes (The Romans took advantage of this to apply the &quot;divide and conquer&quot; routine), Mountain redoubts (Mons Vidius, Mons Medulius...), or troop upgrade.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"85657": "First edition"}, "average": "6.04268", "name": "Iberos", "playingtime": "360", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "41", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5606": "Ancient Rome"}}, "3635": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3196867.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1993", "maxplayers": "6", "age": "12", "boardgamepublisher": {"328": {"name": "Horn Abbot Ltd."}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3196867_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Trivial Pursuit's Country Music edition.

Take their pieces, control the board, dominate the elements, win the game.  Are you up to it?<br/><br/>Elemental has no set up time and you can teach a friend the rules of play in just 10 minutes (in fact, all the moves are printed right on the board).  Like all great games, the rules are simple but the complex strategies are limited only by your creativity and resourcefulness.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/>11&times;11 inch Full Color Game Board<br/>4 Full Color Reference cards<br/>Scads of double-sided full color playing pieces<br/>rules of Play Card<br/>Storage Bag<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     CCG Workshop (no longer available)<br/><br/><br/>"}, "3645": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic12168.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"38217": {"name": "The Overrunning of the West"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1479": {"name": "Nick Schuessler"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1985", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamepublisher": {"352": {"name": "Task Force Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "360", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic12168_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "360", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "description": "Planned to be a nine-part series of games covering all of WWII based on the B.H.

Crawling around on the floor, and spatial skills for estimating firing angles make the game unlike most of its cousins.<br/><br/>A playing area of perhaps 8 feet square is the minimum requirement, 12 feet square is better, with a bare floor or very short carpet. Two or more players plop down their starships on the floor. Everyone plots their moves simultaneously, allocating limited engine energy to some combination of movement, shields and weapons. Moves are executed simultaneously. Weapons have varying arcs of fire, and shield strength is independent on the four sides of the ship, so clever move plotting is critical to victory.<br/><br/>After movement, there is simultaneous combat. Shooting is the unusual element of the mechanics. Each starship has a compass card, with a silhouette in the middle. The player must estimate the exact correct angle to fire at, stretch out a string from the center of their card, and hope that their chosen angle intersects the silhouette of the chosen opponent.<br/><br/>Damage is logged in points against different capabilities of the starship, allowing for the damaged or crippled ships familiar from the Star Trek TV episodes and films. Different weapons and angles of fire allow for unique abilities for different races and starships.<br/><br/>The game was originally published in 1972 as Star Trek Battle Manual (this was not licensed and therefore was not sold for long).<br/><br/>The closely related Alien Space Battle Manual came out in 1973, offering a completely different set of alien races and somewhat different hit/damage rules, but allowing for interplay between the two different games.<br/><br/>"}, "3668": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic10342.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1554": {"name": "Tom Braunlich"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2000", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "7", "boardgamepublisher": {"229": {"name": "Decipher"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic10342_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "A self-contained spin-off of the Star Trek Customizable Card Game from Decipher, Tribbles is a fairly straightforward card game where you are trying to empty your 7 card hand in order to score points (&quot;tribbles&quot;) that you have been able to play. Each card represents a certain quantity of &quot;tribbles&quot; (1, 10, 1000, or 10,000.) The game play follows a sequential order, with each player needing to play the next higher value of tribble out of his hand than the one played immediately before.  If no such card is held, the player must pass and draw a card from his personal deck. There are also optional effects on each card, some reminiscent of Uno (among them Skip and Reverse), that vary the play sequence, score some special points, or allow a player to discard a card. A round ends when either a player is out of hand cards or all but one of the players are out of cards in their deck. Only the player who goes out scores points for his Tribbles played that round. Five rounds make a game. The player who scores the most tribbles in those five rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>The game provides four pre-constructed decks totaling 112 cards, which are color coded to fit a theme. These cards can be interchanged to create different decks. To make the game even more customizable, &quot;tribbles&quot; cards from the ST:CCG expansion set &quot;The Trouble With Tribbles&quot; are compatible with this game. These cards can increase the highest tribbles card to 100,000, plus add a new special ability (a bonus for collecting a specific set of cards) and different combinations than those included in the boxed set.<br/><br/>Also included in the game are reference cards which list the makeup of each standard deck and explain what the special effects are.

It pitted the forces of Brian Boru, high king of Ireland, against a Norse-Irish alliance comprising the forces of Sigtrygg Silkbeard, king of Dublin, M&aacute;el M&oacute;rda mac Murchada, king of Leinster, and a Viking contingent led by Sigurd of Orkney and Brodir of Mann. It lasted from sunrise to sunset, and ended in a rout of the Viking and Leinster forces. It is estimated that between 7,000 and 10,000 men were killed. Although Brian's forces were victorious, Brian himself was killed, as were his son Murchad and his grandson Toirdelbach. Leinster king M&aacute;el M&oacute;rda and Viking leaders Sigurd and Brodir were also slain.<br/><br/>Game from Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #162 (along with Saipan) depicting a long forgotten but interesting subject.

The game is consequently slower to conduct than a board wargame such as Tactics II. For miniature wargamers who felt that the amount of detail was excessive, Reese and Tucker recommended their earlier Fast Rules (1970) although that set covered WWII only.<br/>Tractics require the use of a judge.Since players are unaware of their enemies locations the pieces are placed on the map only when they are detected or the march to an open view.<br/>The tanks in tractics have a 30% chance to hit a target which in essence means rolling at least a 15 on the 20 sided die.

Play begins with the players inserting the sticks through the tube and then pouring the marbles into the top of the tube. The sticks act as a web that block the marbles at the top of the tube. At this point, the players begin to carefully remove the sticks one by one. The goal is to get the stick out without making any of the marbles sitting on top fall through. If any marbles fall through, the person who made them fall collects them. Once the last marble has fallen, players count their collected marbles, and the player with the fewest marbles wins the game.<br/><br/>Ker Plunk was first published by the Ideal Toy Company in 1967, then later by Mattel and finally by Tyco in 1991. Mattel also published a variant of this game called &ldquo;Super Ker-Plunk!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Toy Story Ker Plunk!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"348360": "Arxon first edition"}, "average": "4.76801", "name": "Ker Plunk", "playingtime": "20", "age": "5", "usersrated": "971", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4665": "Children's Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"7178": "Animals: Apes / Monkeys"}}, "3730": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic15630.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"216347": "Statis Pro Baseball Advanced"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"2137": {"name": "Jim Barnes"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1971", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamepublisher": {"5": {"name": "The Avalon Hill Game Co"}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic15630_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Baseball game that is played using charts and pitcher and batter cards that accurately represent stats for real-life players.

Some 25 scenarios, ranging from ship vs. ship (training exercises) to fleet actions (the Nile Campaign) cover a variety of British, French, Russian, Turkish, and Spanish ships throughout the period. In addition to the Napoleonic Wars, there are selected actions from the American War of Independence and the War of 1812.<br/><br/>Developed for over 10 years by Mark Campbell, Close Action features 70 1&quot;x &frac12;&quot; ship counters, 140 markers and accommodates from two to sixteen players on its two 34&quot;x22&quot; maps.

Played on a hex grid, the ships move fairly accurately and historic battles can be recreated with lots of realism.

Each chicken begins with only one tail feather, in its color. The chickens are then placed randomly on the egg tiles, with an equal number of unoccupied tiles separating each chicken from the next chicken &quot;ahead&quot; of it on the pathway as separate it from the next chicken &quot;behind&quot; it, with the goal that they be well spread out on the pathway.<br/><br/>Gameplay: The game is then played in turns, with players attempting to move their chickens clockwise around the pathway. On a player's turn, she looks at the image on the next egg tile in front of her chicken. The player then turns over one of the 12 face down octagon yard tiles. If the tile turned over shows the same image as the egg tile, the player moves forward one space on to that egg tile, turns the octagon back face down, and then repeats the process with the next egg tile. When the player turns over an octagon with an image that does not match the next egg tile in front of her, her turn ends and her chicken goes no farther. If the next tile in front of a player is occupied by someone else's chicken, then the player looks at the image that is on the egg tile in front of the other chicken, and then attempts to turn over the octagon showing *that* image. If the player succeeds, her chicken &quot;leapfrogs&quot; over the chicken in front of her to land on that egg tile, and in the process steals all tail feathers that the other chicken had - including those it stole from other players in the same manner. When one player has all of the tail feathers, that player wins the game.<br/><br/>In Sum: A creative memory game that ties memory to pawn movement.  The first player to successfully memorize the images on each of the 12 octagon tiles, both from their own turns and from watching other players flip the octagons on their turns, will be able to move their chicken around the yard without stopping, and in doing so will win the game. The placement of the octagons is random, so the challenge is fresh each game.<br/><br/>This game is part of The Chicken Family of Zoch<br/><br/>The Zicke Zacke Igelkacke version has the same rules but hedgehogs instead of chicken, and it's in a smaller box.<br/>The Hasbro version has the same rules, but is a Dragon Tales re-theme with large cardboard dragons as player pieces.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"26413": "999 Games Dutch first edition 1998"}, "average": "6.61542", "name": "Chicken Cha Cha Cha", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2047": "Memory"}, "age": "4", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "2202", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4665": "Children's Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"7535": "Animals: Chickens"}}, "3571": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic178400.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1081": {"name": "Jim Dunnigan"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1973", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"1030": "Redmond A.

Realism buffs will want to modify the rules or look for a different game.  Changes in a plane's status are recorded by moving counters rather than using a pencil and paper.  Changes in elevation, for example, are indicated by moving a counter along a looped Climb Progress track (different in length for each plane) until passing the 'top', which means the plane has climbed to the next level. At this point the counter on the board representing the plane is replaced with one showing its new level (numbered 1 - 20). Hits are noted on the speed track, such that the plane's maximum speed is reduced as it takes more hits, until the stall speed is reached, when the plane is considered shot down. Each plane uses a unique firing table printed on its record card.<br/>A plane's maneuverability is characterized by its ratings for turns, barrel rolls, wing-overs, and diving costs, as well as its acceleration.<br/>Play set scenarios, or simply pit your favourite planes against each other in a dog fight!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"107299": "SPI First Edition"}, "average": "5.44545", "name": "Spitfire", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "55", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"18356": "Jim Dunnigan Tactical Air Combat System"}}, "3572": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic178463.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1081": {"name": "Jim Dunnigan"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1976", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"1030": "Redmond A.

It depicted a hypothetical corps-level invasion of North America by a coalition of three invaders: The European Socialist coalition, the South American Union, and the Pan Asiatic League. The game is played on a 35 inch by 42 inch map, with 400 cardboard pieces representing the armed forces in the war. As was typical of wargames of this genre, each piece had numerical combat and movement ratings printed on it. The board is divided up into small hexagons (each of which represented approximately 50,000 square kilometers). On each turn a player can move all of his pieces through a number of hexagon spaces equal to its movement rating. Then pieces in adjacent spaces engage in combat by comparing their combat ratings and rolling dice. The combat ratings and the dice roll are cross-referenced to determine the outcome of the combat. Many spaces on the map also have distinctive terrain features like forests or mountains which affect the ratings of units in those spaces.<br/><br/>Invasion: America is intended as a four player game; one player is the defender and controlls the forces of the United States and Canada (Mexico and Central America were American-occupied territory). The other three players are the three invaders of the coalition. Each turn of the game represents one month and the game lasts for 60 turns. The North American player wins if he still controls a portion of the continent by the game's end. If the North American player loses, whichever of the invading players holds the most territory is the winner. The result is that the invaders cooperated to an extent in attacking the North American player but ultimately were competing against each other.  Invasion: America was a popular game for SPI and led to a 1978 sequel, Objective Moscow, in which it was the Soviet Union that was being invaded.<br/><br/>Issued in both box format and flat tray<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"102316": "SPI Designer's Edition"}, "average": "6.49633", "name": "Invasion: America", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "177", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"26464": "Alternate History"}}, "3573": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic198055.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"23641": {"name": "Napoleon at Waterloo Advanced Game Expansion Kit"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1081": {"name": "Jim Dunnigan"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1971", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"1030": "Redmond A.
