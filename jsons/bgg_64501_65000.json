Each square is marked at one of the  corners to help identify related squares during a complex move.<br/><br/>The game begins in a unique way: <br/>The players agree on how many pawns each side will have.  An empty board is placed between the players and the pawns are placed in front of the players, but not on the board.  Black begins by entering one of his pawns on any square except one of the  &ldquo;border squares&rdquo; (the squares along the edges of the board).  Then White enters a pawn, no more than one square away from Black's, and not on a border square.  The players continue to take turns, either entering a pawn or moving one that is already on the board.<br/><br/>How the pawns move:<br/>An isolated pawn cannot move &ndash; it's frozen (hence the name of the game).  A pawn that is not frozen has the potential to make a jumping or non-jumping move in any direction.  The jump can be over allied as well as opposing pawns.<br/><br/>When an opponent's pawn is jumped over, it's removed from the board.  If the player is not at &ldquo;stage 2,&rdquo; that pawn is returned to the opponent to be reentered.

You haven't seen anything but the narrow walls of the cave for hours. You are afraid that the caves are empty and worse than that, you're lost! Just then, you see a shimmer of gold up ahead flash from the flicker of torch fire. You and Marcus step forward somewhat slower than before. Soon, you both see a beautiful golden sword, once belonging to the Knights of the Cross, just hanging on the cave wall waiting for you to grab it! You think, this seems too easy, but the power and beauty of the fabled relic is very compelling. Just then, Brother Marcus, overtaken with greed, rushes for the sword. But before he takes a second step, you grab his cloak and stop him dead in his tracks. With your staff, you strike the ground to find the entire floor between you and the sword swing open, revealing what could have been a fatal fall.<br/><br/>What will you do next? Are you ready?

Indeed, many of the nation's youth questioned the inherent scientific value of being able to sew an extra head on household pets, and their growing disillusionment gave rise to the socially turbulent decade that was the 1960's.<br/><br/>Dissatisfied with their country's inability to deliver so much as a multi-headed hamster, the youth of America turned to the open road for kicks, and became a new breed of motorcycle-riding outlaws in the 1970s and 1980s. Fueled by high-octane hogs, free love, freer drugs, and rock 'n' roll music, these biker gangs began a relentless nationwide campaign of terrorizing normal folks.<br/><br/>As a new millennium dawns, the clash between the two-headed transplanting idealism of the past and the Harley Davidson rebellion of the present is inevitable.

I just knew that Greek and Roman myth fascinates me. I read the stories as a child and that passion for myth just never died. When I got to college I started taking courses about it, just for my own enjoyment. A half dozen classes later my professor informed me that I was more than half way to a minor in the field and persuaded me to finish. This book is the combined effort of that education, passion and a close collaboration with Daniel Carpenter, Ph.D. in the Classics. We worked together to bring you a game that captures both the letter and spirit of Greek myth. Beyond that, it's fun to play!&quot; -- Nick DiPetrillo<br/><br/>Overview of Arete from game designer Nick DiPetrillo<br/><br/>This is not a Greek setting slapped on top of an existing system. Arete (pronounced are-E-tay. Arrr like you're a pirate. E like you are just saying the name of the letter. Tay like the word ray, only with a T.) is built from the ground up to provide the Greek epic experience.<br/><br/>1. Greek heroes are defined by the size of their actions, not the morality.<br/><br/>2. Combat in Greek epics is fast, visceral and bloody.<br/><br/>3. Gods play a constant role in the lives of heroic figures, for better or worse.<br/><br/>4. Greeks have a unique culture, including elements like blood guilt, guest friendship and proper ritual.<br/><br/>It would be dishonest to suggest that no RPG system thus far has been designed from the ground up to be entirely Greek. For instance, the game Mazes and Minotaurs itself as what would happen if the creators of Dungeons &amp; Dragons their inspiration from Greek mythology instead of Tolkien-like fantasy. The game maintains a Greek setting but attempts to recreate the feel of early Dungeons &amp; Dragons rules. However, the game lacks some of the more unique elements of Greek society in its attempt to emulate D&amp;D. Additionally, the D&amp;D-like rule set does not mechanically enforce a Greek feel. The game Agon another fine example. That game incorporates almost everything from the principles I describe above and manages to feel very Greek in the process. However, those rules are used to support a game that is highly competitive and action based. Both of these games are firmly Greek but they are not the game that I want. In addition to the principles above, there is another set of edicts that mandate how this particular game should be played:<br/><br/>1. The story should be driven by the players and goals of their characters.<br/><br/>2. The players and game master establish the premise of the game together. From that point on it is the role of the game master to be reactionary to the players and introduce complication to their goals.<br/><br/>3. Players should compete for glory but not seek to undermine or defeat each other. The characters are all working towards the game goal, they just want to be the most impressive in attaining it.<br/><br/>4. Even failure should be fun, sending the story in an unexpected direction.<br/><br/>Together, these eight principles are the foundation that all of the game's mechanics are built on. Taken as a whole they explain the fundamental question of why this game should exist and is unlike all others. Those eight ideas are at the core of the system and reveal exactly what Arete is.<br/><br/>The Making Of A Greek Hero<br/><br/>You are going to see the word hero thrown around a lot in this game. We'd better define it then, shall we? You likely already have an idea of what it means to be a hero. Our modern conception of what it takes to be a hero is based on two factors, morality and self-sacrifice.<br/><br/>Heroes are moral people to us. A hero does things like defending the helpless, stopping wrong-doers and making the world a better place. Obviously, there is a lot of room for interpretation as to just what morality is. Regardless, I think all agree that heroes should subscribe to some moral code. Doing the right thing is not heroic on its own, it makes you a good person, but not a hero.<br/><br/>To be a proper heroic act, it must cost you something or potentially cost you something. Heroes to us are self-sacrificing creatures. Firefighters are heroic. They rescue helpless people from burning buildings (moral) and put themselves in lethal danger to do so (self-sacrificing).<br/><br/>Both of these factors operate on a sliding scale. Holding the door open for a little old lady is moral, but it does not compare to saving a life. The self-sacrifice scale is often dependent upon how much you have to sacrifice. A billionaire giving $1,000 to a needy family is certainly nice, but it does not represent the same level of sacrifice as a homeless man giving up his one meal for the day to a starving child who needs it more. The higher up a person falls on these scales of morality and sacrifice, the more heroic we consider them.<br/><br/>Now throw all of that out.<br/><br/>It will be a disservice to you in playing this game. The Greek conception of a hero can be expressed by this equation, called the heroic code:<br/><br/>Excellence (Ideally) = Honor = Deeds + Glory + Prizes<br/><br/>Every person is born with a predetermined amount of excellence, from the poorest farmer to the greatest hero. Only the gods know how large a portion of excellence a person has received, and they aren't telling. In order to demonstrate how excellent they are, heroes attempt to increase their honor to match it. The more honor they have, the more excellence they are assumed to have, because a person's honor should not be able to exceed the amount of excellence he was given at birth. A hero displays his honor by acquiring three things: deeds, glory and prizes. Gathering deeds involves acts such as killing many men in a battle, defeating powerful monsters, tricking an enemy with a clever plot or delivering a stirring speech that rallies an army to victory. Glory is getting stories told about you, having your name and reputation spread far and wide. Glory often comes as a result of doing great deeds, but it is possible to be an unsung hero. Prizes are the spoils acquired in heroic deeds. Prizes could be large amounts of mundane wealth, like coin, slave women and horses gained through sacking a city or it could be objects of special power and significance, like the Golden Fleece or the hide of the Nemean Lion. Those three aspects compose the signs of a hero's honor, which demonstrates how much excellence the hero must have.<br/><br/>Nowhere in that code is morality or altruism represented. Deeds are measured by how grand the actions are, not how good. In ancient Greek myth, single handedly killing a thousand soldiers and taking their wealth was very heroic, even if you actually have no right to it. In all three elements of honor, more is better and it doesn't matter how you do it. For instance, Paris the prince of Troy abducts Helen, the most beautiful woman in Greece. This action begins the ten year long Trojan war, costing thousands of lives and causing the eventually destruction of Troy. All of that was over him taking a woman who was already married to another man. We would consider this a vile act, but to the Greeks it is heroic. Paris increased his honor by getting the impressive prize of the most beautiful woman in the world. The consequences of that action are irrelevant to Paris' heroism.<br/><br/>Does that mean that all Greek heroes are nothing more than selfish jerks with no sense of moral decency at all? No, it doesn't. In fact, Paris' brother Hector is portrayed as a very noble figure in a moral sense. He fights and eventually dies in a fight he knows is hopeless in an attempt to protect the people of his city. Regardless, his good intentions don't make him any more of a hero than his selfish brother. Hector is a greater hero than Paris, but only because he has more according to the code. There are figures far more vile than Hector, but equally heroic. Because the heroic code is separate from ideas of morality, we have a richer range of heroes in Greek myth. Achilles is a crybaby who turns his back on his allies because Agamemnon takes his spoils. Agamemnon himself is an inept leader without any social sense. Heracles, the greatest of the Greek heroes, is drunkard, a philanderer and a savage unfit for civilization even by Greek standards. Yet, they are all still heroes.<br/><br/>Cast off your modern vision of a hero and you will find this game a liberating exercise. Heroes in the game can be everything from paragons of virtue, deeply flawed and even unlikeable individuals who are trying to do their best in life to downright villains who grab all they can for themselves and to Hades with the consequences! No matter what sort they are, they are still heroes. What kind of hero are you going to be?<br/><br/>"}, "64710": {"rpgitemversion": {"18765": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "The Gates of Troy", "rpgproducer": {"24695": "Matt Drake"}, "rpg": {"1788": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)"}, "usersrated": "0", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "average": "0", "description": "From the cover -<br/><br/>The Gates of Troy includes everything you need to find honor, glory and adventure within the legendary citadel or to run a game set during the Trojan War using the core rulebooks alone.<br/><br/>Including details on every aspect of city life, exciting locations and characters and plenty of ideas for adventuring in this city under siege!<br/><br/>"}, "64711": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1262435.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"107": {"name": "Laurent Lavaur"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1993", "maxplayers": "10", "boardgameartist": {"2954": "Bernard Bittler"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"14": {"name": "Ludod\u00e9lire"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1262435_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "Sixth course for Formule D\u00e9 by Ludod\u00e9lire.<br/><br/>38&quot; x 18&quot;; 188 spaces; 8 corners (one &quot;2&quot;); straights 62, 29<br/><br/>cCHUVA : 1-4    VARIAVEL : 5-10     SOLE : 11-20<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "average": "7.28947", "name": "Formule D\u00e9 Circuit \u2116 6: GRANDE PREMIO DE PORTUGAL \u2013 Circuito do Estoril", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "19", "expands": {"37904": {"name": "Formula D"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"5614": "Country: Portugal"}}, "64712": {"rpgitemversion": {"18766": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Future Soldier's Battlefield Handbook", "rpgproducer": {"14095": "Jess Hartley"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1221397.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"458": "Modern (Near Future)"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"305": "d20 Modern"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"5425": "Future Soldier"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1221397_t.png", "description": "From the cover -<br/><br/>The Future Soldier's Battlefield Handbook is the indispensable futuristic d20 supplement, acting as a guide for playing and running campaigns that feature war.

(If you aren&rsquo;t. . . why, order the Core Rules as soon as you can!) A big part of that uniqueness is the cast of personalities in the world. The blend of prominent figures covered virtually every walk of life and abilities. It is all<br/>too possible for an adventuring party to negotiate with the likes of the notorious buccaneer Jame Dupree one week, find themselves at the court of the Kasmarkn King Kalldur Talmount the next, and turning back<br/>great evil alongside the archmage Istolil Hune the one after. . . Or go off on any tangent that can put the adventurers face-to-face with any number of the myriad colorful characters. Will they be allies? Will they<br/>be adversaries?<br/><br/>That is one question this book for the Chronicles of Ramlar RPG will answer, as most major personalities mentioned in not only the Core Rules, but the Redemption Trilogy of novels too, are included. Their history, appearance, disposition, likes, dislikes, motivations and more are now an open book for you to read, and to decide whether their agendas will bring them in allegiance or conflict with the player characters.<br/><br/>Following these entries is an expanded bestiary listing more than 30 creatures to beef up your Ramlar game. Several of the old favorites such as the troll and werewolf have been given a unique Ramlar twist, so<br/>they aren&rsquo;t exactly the same ole monsters you know. This, on top of exotic new beasties like the aquandix, shree&rsquo;oc, and slerass, should present new challenges to the players.<br/><br/>Lastly, we wrap up the book with brief guidelines for creating animal allies, plus statistics for both common animals and those found only on Eranon.

This game uses an updated, and slightly expanded, version of the MedWar Sicily game system: no CRT, just dice, and cards...a totally new approach to gaming battles that can be learned in five minutes and played in 2-3 hours.<br/><br/>Most of the rules and mechanics will be familiar to anyone who has ever played a wargame. Richard Berg however, has added to this simplicity a combat system that rates units for how many dice they get to roll on their behalf, as well as what kind of dice (small arms or Heavy Weapons).<br/><br/>The game also uses cards, one deck (of 10) for each player (whose cards are somewhat different from those of the other player) to enhance the game. (They don't &quot;drive&quot; the game and they can be left out, if you&rsquo;re so inclined.) The cards are part of a Resource system that gives the players a number of points which they can use to buy cards, rally units or bring in reinforcements. The choice is theirs, but there are far more choices than points.<br/><br/>The cards, themselves, give the players &quot;Opportunities&quot;, from using their (or negating their opponent&rsquo;s) tank capabilities, to getting more supplies, to special Breakthrough and Reaction movement.<br/><br/>Playing time for &ldquo;Desert War Egypt&rdquo; as averaged less than 3 hours, and the rules are only 8 pages, including rules for playing Solitaire.<br/><br/>Each game of Desert War Egypt includes full box, rules, one sheet of large 5/8&rdquo; die cut thick counters, dice, two decks of 10 cards, and a thick card stock game board.<br/><br/>According to the back of the box, the game will include new and updated counters for MedWar Sicily, the first game using this system.

Knowledge cards are purchased to help advance, benefit, or protect a player's civilization. Random event cards generate unexpected bonuses or catastrophes.<br/><br/>This is a free, online rules set which describes the components that you will need to create in order to play. Components include an area movement map of Asia Minor, seven sets of uniquely colored counters, six player resource mats, a victory point track consisting of 100 spaces, two custom decks of cards, and six and ten sided dice.

What's different is that today the Earth has been invaded by aliens &ndash; it's just that nobody knows it yet. Deep underground mad scientists are raising monsters from the planet Moongha. Once fully formed they will emerge to spread terror and destruction. Cities will be laid waste to, and the human race will be hunted to extinction.<br/><br/>Through the sewers oozes the Bloob, quietly growing in size. The Drakoor, alien vampires, stalk the night, feeding off the unwary. Meanwhile, the strongest of the Moongha invaders, Mechoor, sucks in energy from the earth. Once sated it will rise to destroy whole cities with its heat ray. These are just a few of the monsters that will terrorise the people of Earth.<br/><br/>It can only be hoped that just as in the movies there's a hero around who can thwart their evil plans; otherwise there will be no more &quot;just another day&quot;s for anybody! But who's behind those evil plans? You! You are one of those sadistic, power-thirsty, psycho nerds, eager for revenge after a whole life of study, disregarded by everyone. All of you have received a visit from a mysterious flying saucer, carrying strange alien machinery &ndash; an engine that finally brought you POWER! And now you are ready to fight your insane struggle to be the first in destroying the human race. This time no &quot;Klaatu barada nikto!&quot; will stop you...<br/><br/>Moongha Invaders: Mad Scientists and Atomic Monsters Attack the Earth! is for three to four players and should take about ninety minutes to play. You have control of a number of different types of Moongha monsters. When you sit down to play, the side of the board closest to you is your monster display. There you will see the seven different types of monster. You will place your monster counters in these boxes. Note that some monster types have more than one counter.<br/><br/>The game lasts either eight or nine turns, depending on the number of players, although it may end before then if a player manages to get down all twenty of their damage cubes.<br/><br/>At the start of each turn a random number of actions are made available. Three of these actions relate to the monsters and allow you to create, attack, and move them. These actions are represented by orange, white, and purple tokens. There are three human action boxes, one that allows you to place a hero, the other two allow you to place military counters.<br/><br/>To create a monster you have to place a certain number of orange tokens in the monster box. Once the monster has been created you place it in one of the twelve cities on the board. When you do so, you place the monster on its hidden side. The monster is alive but as yet the world does not know of its presence. While hidden a monster is safe from attack and can build up its strength so that when it does attack it will cause carnage. Another player may attempt to reveal your monster by placing a hero counter in the same city.<br/><br/>Military units will try to destroy monsters. When you place a military unit or a hero, you can then attack with all military counters in that city. When a monster attacks a city, armor units will attack it first, then after that attack has been completed, any surviving infantry units will attack. All combat involves rolling dice and in all cases a roll of four or more is successful.<br/><br/>Each monster type has its own special abilities. Only three monsters are powerful enough to destroy entire cities; these are the Bloob, Mechoor, and Moogre. When you attack a city, you mark the damage you do with your colored cubes. At the end of the game, players score victory points depending on how many damage cubes they have in each city. Players also score points for the cities that were randomly assigned to them at the beginning of the game, depending on how much damage they have suffered. Points can also be scored for having vampires on the board and for killing other monsters with your Moogre monster.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"182809": "English second edition"}, "average": "6.8473", "name": "Moongha Invaders: Mad Scientists and Atomic Monsters Attack the Earth!", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "10", "usersrated": "589", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"18214": "Cities: Berlin (Germany)"}}, "64827": {"boardgamedesigner": {"810": {"name": "Lloyd Krassner"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Warped Diplomacy Classic", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"19265": "Diplomacy"}, "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic640737_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"873": {"name": "Warp Spawn Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic640737.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"182228": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A web-published board game of European conflict between the Great Powers.

But victory need not be measured in such absolute terms. Some goals can be achieved merely by holding the opponent at bay for a long enough period of time.<br/><br/>When the goal is to hold off rather than physically overcome an adversary, the best tools are misdirection, obfuscation, outright prevarication, and any other techniques that can send the foe down the wrong track for a time. But when the clock is ticking, a good delaying tactic can be just as effective. Crossing the Line pits the heroes against an opponent whose goal has nothing to do with actually beating them. All this particular foe wants to do is keep them from going through the front door.<br/><br/>This adventure can be set in practically any locale. In fact, the details depend entirely on the backstory to which you (as GM) attach it. The antagonist, Remi Leone, should be able to apply his tactics to any desired location with only minor variations.<br/><br/>While Crossing the Line constitutes a complete adventure in its own right, it is best used in combination with another scenario. On his own, Remi Leone is unlikely to have sufficient motivation to interfere with the heroes, although you could certainly orchestrate a situation in which he does. As a gun for hire, though, he is more than happy to use his skills in the service of someone who has a more antagonistic relationship with the heroes.<br/><br/>A Short d20 Modern Adventure for Four 19th-Level Characters<br/><br/>"}, "64839": {"rpg": {"305": "d20 Modern"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Dead of Winter", "rpgproducer": {"15997": "Cynthia Fliege"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic640773.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": {"18837": "PDF version"}, "rpgsetting": {"758": "Urban Arcana"}, "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"848": "Fantasy (Modern Urban Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"4318": "Free d20 Modern Adventures"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic640773_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>From the file's introduction<br/><br/>As the days remaining on the calendar dwindle, it seems as though life does, too.

Smart wrestling fans know that there is far more to the world of professional wrestling than two guys getting in the ring and beating each other up. There is a lot that goes on behind the scenes and in the ring that isn't apparent to the casual wrestling fan.

Each space is a day of a player's trip. Each tile shows a country, a plane, or a ship. Tiles are drawn and placed one at a time, and cannot be moved once placed. Once all players' holders are full, a face-down draw pile is made of the remaining tiles, as well as three face-up discard piles. On his or her turn, a player either takes a face-down tile from the draw pile, or a face-up tile from the top of a discard pile. He or she then decides whether to exchange the new tile with an old one. The tile not being kept is then discarded.<br/>Players are attempting to have all 10 days of their trip connect, either by foot, by plane, or by ship.

Acquire wealth, speculating on Semuta Drug and Pundi Rice prices in the CHOAM. Plan hostile actions against rivals, under the limitations of the Great Convention.&quot;<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>&quot;The game is conducted on 3 boards: on the LANDSRAAD board you can plan political actions; on the CHOAM board you can trade resources for SOLARI (the Imperium currency); on the KANLY board you can plan assassinations, sabotage actions, or even full-scale wars.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Tokens represent commodities (SPICE MELANGE, HAGAL QUARTZ, etc.), or SOLARI (the Imperium currency). Also, there are tokens to represent three NOBLES for each Noble House, and for their soldiers (TROOPERS, SABOTEURS and ASSASSINS). Also there are tokens to represent the special ADVISORS (Mentat or Bene Gesserit) which you could be provided if you met the Emperor's favour.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Cards represent useful situations which could help you during your quest for power. The most powerful ones are you cannot obtain by chance: they are PETITIONS to the Padishah Emperor which he has graciously agreed to concede (or, sometimes, not to concede). Less powerful situations are just acts of FATE.&quot;<br/><br/>Gameplay summary:<br/><br/>&quot;Each player will represent a Noble House and will be given three NOBLE tokens: he will use those tokens to attempt actions in each turn. Actions could be political (LANDSRAAD board), trade (CHOAM board) or hostile (KANLY board): to represent that a player is attempting an action, he will put one of his NOBLE in the appropriate slot on the appropriate board. The number of action a player could do in a turn will be therefore generally limited by the NOBLE tokens he has, even if it will be possible to increase it by mean of ADVISORS.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Each turn is divided in three phases: LANDSRAAD, CHOAM and KANLY; each to be played on the appropriate board.&quot;<br/><br/>Victory:<br/><br/>&quot;When a player will draw the End Game Fate Card, he will immediately show it, and the game will end.

Creatures can't be anywhere: they must be In a Room. To represent this, you need to put your Creatures near the Rooms they're in. A creature in a Room can defend it, but cannot defend a different Room . . . So be wary not to expand your Dungeon too much, or you will be unable to defend it.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;A Creature in a Room can also use the Room. So, for example, your Warlock in your Library will be able to research a Spell (or to defend the Library). If you want him to defend the Lair, instead, you can move him in the Lair (in the appropriate Turn Phase), but then he will be unable to research a Spell (as he need to be in the Library to do so).&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You can win in two ways: 1) Kill the Avatar when he's attacking your Dungeon (The World Will Be Mine!
