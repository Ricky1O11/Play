These individuals, the tinkers, are exemplars of the unfettered creative spirit. It is this creative spirit, the constant thirst for new ideas, that propels them to seek the unknown, whether it be found in a library or in the dark depths of an ancient tomb.  Supported by a vast array of custom automatons, an experienced tinker, while not a fierce combatant on his own, commands an exceptionally versatile squadron that more than makes up for his own deficiencies.<br/><br/>The Tinker: Master of Modular Mechanical Mayhem is the end result of months of playtesting and development. Presented herein is the Tinker base class, an individual who can be described as a &quot;non-spellcaster spellcaster&quot;. The domain of the tinker is the mundane. While others dominate the battlefield with arms and arcane might, the tinker does so through mechanical means.<br/><br/>The tinker's greatest asset is the variety of machines he can bring to bear in a fight. Small, mindless automatons make up the bulk of this power, but experienced tinkers are capable of building autonomous Alphas that act as the tinker's #2. Sentient, the alpha can eventually learn to order around the automatons so the tinker doesn't have to. Further, truly skilled tinkers are followed around by a swarm of nanobots. This swarm is capable of rending most any material into its constituent pieces and then rebuilding it into something useful. Many of the dragonscale breastplates that exist in the world today were crafted from a dragon in six seconds flat by a tinker swarm.<br/><br/>To allow for maximum modularity, the tinker has a brand new magic-like system: inventions! Tinkers can learn inventions, place them into blueprints, and then deploy automatons based on those blueprints.<br/><br/>This product features:<br/><br/>     The Tinker base class<br/>     Progression tables for the tinker, his automatons, and his alpha<br/>     4 feats<br/>     21 innovations (talents)<br/>     12 greater innovations (greater talents)<br/>     121 inventions with full summary invention list<br/>     Dozens of pregenerated automaton configurations to get the creative juices flowing<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "142003": {"rpgartist": ["Frank Hessefort", "Tanya Sangsnit"], "rpgitemversion": ["Landscape PDF version", "Portrait PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Beyond the Void", "rpgdesigner": ["Jason Nelson"], "rpgproducer": ["Elizabeth Courts", "Timothy K.

To win, you must push the opposing army back or outmaneuver it, so that your own army can advance and eventually carry The Flag into the other player&rsquo;s territory. Meanwhile, the opponent can engage you in battles to stop your advancement and try to take control of The Flag.<br/><br/>In A Fair Battleground, skillful deployment and maneuvering is more important than raw impact, but typical winning tactical moves of the era like attacking the opposing armies from behind are forbidden. Asymmetry between players is given not by a different mix of forces or objectives, but rather by the interplay of two pairs of opposing roles (Advancing vs Contending and Attacker vs Defender) that the two players take and exchange during the game. These roles determine both what the players can do and when they can do it, as well as which of the different armies are more useful to each of them.<br/><br/>Battle resolution is basically luck-less, but a simple optional rule that adds a random factor is provided for players who prefer luck-based systems.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>A Fair Battleground is a print-and-play game that uses a board and 20 counters; the players must supply 9 euro-cubes or similar objects to be used as markers, and, optionally, two six-sided dice.<br/><br/>A Fair Battleground was an entry in the 2013 Two-Player Print-and-Play Design Contest.<br/><br/>"}, "142015": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Bartosz Chlebicki"], "poll": [], "name": "Pompker", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Betting/Wagering", "Player Elimination", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "10", "boardgamefamily": ["Poker", "Traditional Card Games"], "average": "7.25", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Sports"], "age": "14", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Pompker is a &quot;push-up poker&quot;.

The game is a follow up to the 2005 video game Namco &times; Capcom and features characters from Namco Bandai Games, Capcom, and Sega. The game was released on October 11, 2012 in Japan and will be released in North America on June 25, 2013 and in Europe on July 5, 2013.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Stages in Project X Zone take place in grid-based locations from the game's many crossover titles. Each friendly unit is made up of two characters (thus referred to as a Pair Unit), though a third character (or &quot;Solo Unit&quot;) can be added for once-per-battle assistance. Unlike Namco &times; Capcom, units can move freely within their range on the field map, with no penalty for accessing treasure chests or destructible objects prior to attacking.<br/><br/>The battle system is called the Cross Active Battle System, wherein pressing the A button in combination with the Circle Pad performs up to five basic attack combos. Additional gameplay elements include Support Attack, which allows the player to call in a nearby ally for assistance, and Cross Hit, which freezes the target in place during simultaneous attacks from multiple units. Also, the player can trigger Critical Hits by connecting their next attack just before the target hits the ground after the first. As the player's units deal damage, the player's Cross Power (XP) gauge fills up and can be used for special attacks and defensive moves on the map. Damage done via Cross Hits can fill this gauge up to 150%.<br/><br/>Project X Zone has a total of 15 save game slots included in the game, which can be used for recording a save game file during intermissions with a quick save file and a soft reset command.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Project X Zone&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "142028": {"poll": [], "name": "The Denpa Men 2: Beyond the Waves", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Nintendo 3DS eShop edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Cute Fantasy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Genius Sonority"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo 3DS"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Genius Sonority"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>The Denpa Men 2: Beyond the Waves is the second title in the Denpa Men series of role-playing games for the Nintendo 3DS.

Her spirit is capable of merging with this new body, causing there to be no loss of mental continuity, as is typically a problem with similar methods.<br/>     Cut the Thread - Everything in the world is tethered to the ever-spun tapestry of history by the tiniest of threads. The witch can see them; what's more, she can cut them. With but a touch, the witch can make those who truly anger her experience a fate worse than death. Their actions simply don't matter to the universe anymore.<br/>     Distilled Life - By brewing an elixir containing a small child as the key material component, the witch can cheat death for another decade or so.<br/>     Dream Possession - The witch can reach out and mentally dominate people when they sleep.<br/>     Master Herbalist - The witch's poultices can raise the dead.<br/>     Sacricficial Crow - The witch's familiar becomes incorporeal. Should it ever be destroyed, it reforms 24 hours later at the witch's side.<br/>     Touch of Witchcraft - Being the lazy slob that it is, the witch's patron empowers her with the ability to pick the next generation of witch. In return for her services, she gains a wish.<br/>     Withering - A few truly terrifying witches can cause creatures to wither in mere moments.

King's Godliness Phase: During this phase, if a bad king is reigning over Israel, the players must draw a Sin &amp; Punishment card, which means bad things occur in Israel because of evil or in response to evil. If during the reign of a good king, the starting player receives a Blessing card.<br/><br/>2.  Sin Increases Phase: Location cards are drawn and sin increases at each revealed location. This can possibly cause idols to appear or sin to spread further if sin increases at a location with an idol.<br/><br/>3.  Prophets Work Phase: In this phase each prophet gets to use four actions to accomplish their goals. They may use their actions to move, remove sin or idols, draw resource cards, build an altar, make a sacrifice at an altar, or to give resources to another player. A prophets may also play Blessing cards at this time if they have them. In expert mode, after all the prophets take their turn, the false prophet takes his turn.<br/><br/>4.  End of Round Phase: The starting player changes to the next player and the timeline token moves down to the next king chronologically.

It sees the player controlling several forts in a group of connected bases, choosing each round which base will create new forces that are used to attack enemy positions.<br/><br/>Players navigate their characters across a map attempting to take their opponent's bases. The map is set up as a grid of connected forts, with each player controlling a section of the map. The game is turn-based; each turn the player selects one of their bases to be their main base. At the end of each turn, the main base spawns troops. The amount of forces created depends on the number of held bases. The player then sends these troops either towards their own bases to reinforce them or towards enemy bases in order to capture them. Troops do not travel instantly, allowing circumstances to change at the target base before they arrive. Capturing bases is done by comparing the attacking troops' numbers with the defending, with larger numbers winning. Some bases provide additional bonuses to the side that holds them, such as increased movement speed or attack power. The match ends when one player controls the entire map.

With 80 unique and progressively challenging puzzles, players will be increasingly entertained as they save the work site from the impending water flow.<br/><br/>Because A-Maze-ing Pipes is based on the classic pipe puzzle game, players of all ages can enjoy the colorful world of the Working Dawgs. As the player progresses through each puzzle, The Working Dawgs will help the player by delivering integral pipe pieces and wrenches. At the end of each puzzle, the Dawgs will celebrate the player&rsquo;s success, or will panic depending on how the pipeline directs the gushing water.<br/><br/>In addition, bonus points are awarded when the water is routed in the correct direction in a designated puzzle area. As each puzzle is completed, the player will be awarded points, earning them an overall construction grade. The additional challenge of earning the highest grade on each puzzle makes this game even more captivating.<br/><br/>Working Dawgs: A-Maze-ing Pipes is the puzzle game you simply won&rsquo;t be able to put down.<br/><br/><br/>     80 Puzzles to conquer.<br/>     A point total and grade are awarded depending on pipe pieces and bonuses acquired.<br/>     Dawgs will help to bring supplies to solve each puzzle.<br/>     Use bombs to make room for more pipes.<br/>     Large scrollable play areas.<br/>     Drag-and-Drop stylus control.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>Source: The Publisher/Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "142116": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1647219.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Heiko W\u00fchrmann"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Andreas Focke", "Karl-Heinz Knief"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Vitakraft"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1647219_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Children's Game", "Dice", "Educational", "Racing"], "description": "CHAMPION, of the great race, is the game where all participants can win with their favorite horses.<br/>An exciting race at a gallop or obstacle course!

The player is charged with travelling back in time to stop an artificial intelligence called Alpha Core from altering ENIAC, the first computer, and thus making itself more powerful in the future. The gameplay takes place in waves, meaning that enemies will appear in the same groups and formations in the same order every playthrough. The player doesn't get to choose what order to engage an entire stage's enemies, just the ones in the current wave. This rail-shooter element does not hamper the player's freedom to fly where they choose in most stages. On some stages, the player has complete control of Omega Boost, specifically areas where they are in Planet ETA's atmosphere. Other stages limit the player in terms of speed (falling through the timeshaft).<br/> The &quot;Boost&quot; part of the mech's name comes from Omega Boost's booster pack, allowing the player to move in any direction and circle strafe enemies with a scanning and lock-on feature. Omega Boost also learns the Viper Boost maneuver once it is levelled up. Viper Boost, when engaged, will cause Omega Boost to glow blue as it tears through enemies on screen. Destroying enemies will cause the gauge to refill incrementally. However, the game can be completed without ever using Viper Boost. If Viper Boost is used, the final ranking will have &quot;Pixy&quot; added onto the title, showing the attack during play.<br/> The game has high production values with a few music tracks by the bands Loudmouth and the song &quot;Otsegolation&quot; by Static-X. The game also features a live action introduction and mecha designs by Shoji Kawamori of Macross fame. The US, Japanese and European releases feature different theme music with the US version using &quot;Fly&quot; by Loudmouth, the Japanese version using &quot;Shade&quot; by Feeder and the European version using &quot;Dreamer&quot; by Cast.<br/> Being released late in the PlayStation's life, Omega Boost is said to have some of the best graphics on the console with parts of the game running at 60 frame/s. The game was criticised by some reviewers for being too short (Nine levels with nine unlockable special missions) and simplistic. However, it is still considered one of the best Macross style mecha simulation games produced and is thought of by many as a sleeper hit due to its poor marketing.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Omega Boost&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "142173": {"poll": [], "name": "Cosmic Smash", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Dreamcast edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["SEGA Rosso"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["Sega Dreamcast"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SEGA Corporation"], "description": "Cosmic Smash (\u30b3\u30ba\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30de\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5) is an arcade game that was later ported to the Dreamcast console.

While tried and true, both of these spellcasting types don&rsquo;t do a very good job of modeling how spellcasters tend to work in popular fantasy fiction.

Further, the system is designed only for actual spellcasters, ignoring the spell-like abilities of monks and other classes dissimilar enough from true spellcasters to not need the same kind of spell point houserules.<br/><br/>"}, "142213": {"rpgartist": ["Claudia Burgos", "Juan Diego Dianderas", "James Hazelett", "Emma Lazauski", "Eric Lofgren", "Giordano Pranzoni", "Jason Rainville", "Wayne Reynolds", "Jonathan Roberts", "Shaman's Stockart", "Hugo Solis", "Kurt Taylor", "Arthur Wang", "Jeff Ward", "Amanda Webb", "John Wigley"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "statistics": [], "name": "Heroes of the Jade Oath (Pathfinder)", "rpgdesigner": ["Frank Carr", "Steven D.

Two shock groups were formed, with one consisting primarily of the 100th J&auml;ger Division, whose task was to clear and control Mamaev Kurgan, followed by an advance into the Tennis Racket and the Bannyi Ravine and finally to occupy the Krasnyi Oktiabr workers' settlements. Paulus' counterpart, General Chuikov was well aware of these preparations and had planned appropriate spoiling attacks, though he was unaware of the fresh German reinforcements. His attack was disrupted before it could even begin, with waves of Stukas strafing his advancing forces. His strongpoint on the crest of the burial mound was destroyed. Bombs and artillery cut down the attackers, decimating their ranks and allowing the following German advance to gain ground. The j&auml;gers advanced two regiments abreast and captured the western slopes, but initially failed to take the southern slopes. The 227th J&auml;ger Regiment's vigorous assaults, supported by intense artillery, destroyed the Russian ability to hold on. The Germans would secure the summit that evening (though some bypassed remnants would harass the Germans on the southern and western slopes for the next few days). By day's end, the 95th Division retained a foothold on the northern and eastern slopes of the burial mound, but was down to only 400 effective fighting men.<br/><br/>The Battle of Stalingrad has received no shortage of treatment in the wargame realm since Red BarricadesTM first focused the attention of ASLers on the factory complexes of the doomed city. No tactical-level game has ever treated the titanic and unique battle for Stalingrad's Mamayev Hill, aka Mamayev Kurgan ... until NOW. From the first thrusts of Hitler's Wehrmacht on 13 September to the last days of 1942 the hill changed hands time and again. By 27 September the Germans had again captured half of Mamayev Kurgan. The Soviets held their own positions on the slopes of the hill, as the 284th Rifle Division desperately defended key strongholds. The defenders held out until 26 January 1943, when the Soviet winter offensive known as Operation Uranus, relieved them, in the process trapping and destroying the German VI Armee in the tomb of Stalingrad.<br/><br/>"}, "142230": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Andreas Propst"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Get the Cheese!", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Commodity Speculation", "Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Andreas Propst"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Card Game", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Humor", "Pirates", "Prehistoric", "Science Fiction"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "&quot;Get the Cheese!&quot; is probably the cheesiest card game you ever put your hands on!<br/><br/>It is a non-collectible, non-customizable easy-to-pick up yet quite strategic and fun card game for 2 - 4 players.<br/><br/>Choose one out of four unique, whacky Characters, each of them coming with a 30 card deck filled with helpful, equally whacky and way cheesy &ldquo;Pals&rdquo;, strange &ldquo;Stuff&rdquo; and dastardly &ldquo;Deeds&rdquo; and go on the hunt for the Cheese!

Inside each box, an apprentice will find a succession scroll. Contained on the scroll is the last piece of knowledge required to become the Drago Magi &mdash; but only one can claim the title. Each scroll holds a different &quot;Spell of Succession&quot; that may be executed only with the correct combination of rare gems. These magically imbued gems appear in sets of three only during times of succession and must be collected by dragons at the command of each apprentice. The competitor who is first to collect the gems needed to complete his Spell of Succession becomes the new Drago Magi. For the loser, the unofficial title whispered under the breath of the people is &quot;Novitius Eterna&quot; or &quot;Forever a Novice&quot;.<br/><br/>Be swift and remember, there is little room for error.<br/><br/>Draco Magi is a card game designed by Richard Launius and Robert Burke. To start, each player selects an apprentice dragon mage he wishes to play. Each mage receives a deck of dragon cards that includes multiple copies of four different chromatic dragons (Green, Red, Black &amp; Purple), four different metallic dragons (Gold, Silver, Brass &amp; Bronze), and two special dragon cards (the Battle dragon and the Polar dragon). Each dragon has a different strength, weakness and special ability. Players will send their dragons, one at a time, to capture gems on different battlefields; each battlefield offers a different effect that may give an advantage or disadvantage to certain types of dragons.<br/><br/>Players alternate playing dragon cards on battlefields until they have played all eight of their Dragon cards. Each player can play a maximum of three dragons on a single battlefield. When a dragon is placed, it may make a ranged attack. Not all dragons have a ranged attack breath weapon, but those that do have a breath weapon icon with a number. The number indicates the number of battle cards the player may reveal when attempting to hit with a ranged attack. A defender may defend with the number of cards equal to the dragon's shield value. A ranged attack can take place immediately only when the card is played against an opposing dragon. If a ranged attack is not used at this moment, the ranged attack is forfeited for the current round.<br/><br/>After all dragon cards have been played, the melee phase of the battle begins. Each dragon has a &quot;melee attack&quot; value printed on its card which represents the number of battle cards the player can draw for the battle. The melee battle mechanism is a unique attack and counter system that provides opportunity for deduction, subtlety, and deadly combos. Players will also earn advance battle cards that build up their decks over the course of the game. The player with the most dragons present on a battlefield wins that gem. In the case of a tie, the dragons and gem remain for the next round.<br/><br/>Draco Magi is a fast game heavily connected to its theme that incorporates area control, bluffing, hand management, deck building and deduction.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "Polish first edition"], "average": "6.6168", "name": "Draco Magi", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Card Drafting", "Deck / Pool Building", "Hand Management"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["167822", "182810"], "usersrated": "579", "boardgameaccessory": ["Draco Magi: Foil Dragon Cards"], "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Dragons", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["AUG The Game of Crowd Funding Robert Burke &amp; Richard Launius Interview 01-13-2014", "Episode 31 - Where Dragons Rule", "Episode 37 The Oddball Draco Aeronauts Magi Happy Fun Time", "Episode 83-- Live from GEN CON Part 2-- from the show floor", "Hearty Health Hospital", "The Game Pit: Episode 25 - Treasure Hunt - Part Two"]}, "142263": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1669571.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Isaac Vega"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Pavel Guzenko", "Peter Wocken"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Plaid Hat Games"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1669571_t.png", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Video Game Theme"], "description": "A special promo card that was released both with pre-orders of the board game through the Plaid Hat Games website and with the BioShock Infinite Limited Edition Strategy Guide from Brady Games.<br/><br/>This card adds a usable advantage to the founder player and can be used in place of the regular songbird action card included within the regular game.

If a match occurs, the two matching players face-off and must quickly give an example of something within the category (eg. breakfast food, lake, reptile) listed on the opposing player's card.  The first person to finish saying a correct answer wins the face-off and takes the opponent's card into a face down &quot;winnings&quot; pile.

Further, you can detect traps as a rogue if and only if the trap contains an Illusion spell.<br/>        <br/>    <br/>     Facets (Patterns) - Whether they be miners, jewelers, or perhaps jewel-obsessed nobles, your family includes a long history of caring about gemstones in some way shape, or form. The way they scatter light once cut, the fire of a raw gem, internalized and muted by the ravages of obscene heat and pressure, these sing to your soul as song does a bard. This hereditary love of the jewel has found its way into your family's psyche and, by extension, your magic.<br/>         Abilities Include:<br/>             Bloodline Arcana - You may use a gem as an optional material component. If you do, increase the DC and caster level of the spell.<br/>             Gemflash - Throw an illusory gem, dazzling creatures in a small radius. At higher levels, daze weak creatures.<br/>             Facetlord - Creatures who strike you in melee are subjected to the color spray spell.<br/>        <br/>    <br/>     Restless (Figments) - A being of great power, whether it be a god, a fiend, a celestial, or just a really upset wizard, has cursed your family to never enjoy the rewards of the afterlife; instead, your family languishes for eternity as restless spirits bound to the prime material plane. As a sorcerer, this curse has made itself manifest in your magic. Strange apparitions appear when you will them, but are still capable of affecting the world proper. In essence, you blur the barrier between the real and the unreal, between figments and reality, between corporeal and incorporeal.<br/>         Abilities Include:<br/>             Bloodline Arcana - Your figments get a bonus to their DC to disbelieve if they initiate contact.<br/>             Shimmering Spirit - Summon forth an illusion that slowly becomes more real as you level. At high levels, it can manipulate objects, speak, and even attack.<br/>             Realistic Figments - A figment becomes real for one round.

Understanding Errod&rsquo;s drive to slay the white worm hearkens to Captain Ahab&rsquo;s quest for the white whale.  Indeed the Worm itself is a classical representation of supernatural horror and intrigue that Bram Stoker so poignantly captured in Dracula and other novels.

The flagship game of the independent company ZAMA Game Design, Swords and Heroes challenges players in a simple-yet-engaging combat system.<br/><br/>The game uses a detailed &ldquo;Cards and Shards&rdquo; system that uses board-based tactical &ldquo;shards&rdquo; to represent battlefield units of the respective armies. Basic statistics and abilities of these units are represented by beautifully-designed game cards held by each player. Units range from light-armored infantry to long-ranged archers or heavy cavalry, but vary wildly based on the historical civilization chosen by the player.<br/><br/>After custom-designing their armies using a simple point-based creation mechanic, players field their armies and face off for the control of the board with easy-to-learn dice-based turn mechanics. Players also make use of &ldquo;General&rsquo;s Orders&rdquo; cards that offer players powerful and unique means of shifting the course of battle. Once the enemy has been eliminated from the board, the remaining general stands victorious!<br/><br/>The Swords and Heroes: Starter Set comes with all of the necessary rules and game components required, as well as two Classical Age armies: The Roman Empire and the Germanic Tribes. Future expansion packs will also offer players additional armies, such as Han China, Alexander&rsquo;s Macedonia, Parthian Persia, and more!<br/><br/>"}, "142300": {"rpgdesigner": ["Emetaro Aiko", "Kentaro Hayashi", "Ryo Kamiya", "Saint Marc", "Radiwoheddo"], "rpgitemversion": ["Localization of Yuuyake Kyoake", "PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Golden Sky Stories: Heart-Warming Role-Playing", "rpghonor": ["2013 Golden Geek Best RPG Artwork/Presentation Nominee", "2014 Indie Game of the Year Runner-Up", "2014 Indie RPG Awards Best Production Runner-Up", "2014 Indie RPG Awards Best Support Runner-Up", "2014 Indie RPG Awards Most Innovative Game Runner-Up"], "rpgproducer": ["Charles Boucher", "Grant Chen", "Ewen Cluney", "Clay Gardner", "Michael Stevens"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1829373.jpg", "usersrated": "15", "average": "8.1", "rpgissuearticle": ["Golden Sky Stories"], "rpgartist": ["Emetaro Aiko", "hira", "Ike"], "rpggenre": ["Childhood", "Culture (Asian / Far Eastern)", "Kid-Friendly", "Mythology / Folklore (Fairy Tales)", "Social (Relationships / Romance)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Star Line Publishing"], "rpg": ["Yuuyake Koyake"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1829373_t.jpg", "description": "from the Kickstarter campaign<br/><br/>Golden Sky Stories is a heartwarming, non-violent role-playing game from Japan, by Ryo Kamiya, the creator of Maid: The Role-Playing Game.

Players that decided to compete then all reveal their card at once and compare their number.<br/><br/>The player with the highest number wins, but the player that has the smallest numbered card also adds the number of the current Kobayakawa on top of it.<br/><br/>Example:<br/>Kobayakawa: 8<br/>Player A: 9<br/>Player B: Pass<br/>Player C: 15<br/>Player D: 12<br/><br/>Player C has the highest card value (15), but Player A is declared the winner as the results of the lowest card and the Kobayakawa is 17.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["Argentinian first edition", "Brazilian first edition", "Chinese first edition", "English first edition", "French first edition", "German first edition", "Japanese first edition"], "name": "Kobayakawa", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": ["Betting/Wagering"], "age": "9", "usersrated": "1111", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games", "Party Games"], "average": "6.38678", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 87- Haspelknecht"]}, "142326": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1708628.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Eight-Minute Empire"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ryan Laukat"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Ryan Laukat"], "boardgamepublisher": ["dV Giochi", "Hobby World", "IELLO", "MINDOK", "Red Raven Games", "Schwerkraft-Verlag"], "maxplaytime": "32", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1708628_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "16", "boardgamecategory": ["Civilization", "Exploration", "Mythology", "Territory Building"], "description": "Build a small empire in a land of legends!<br/><br/>Eight-Minute Empire: Legends is a standalone sequel to the area control game Eight-Minute Empire and does not require the original game to play.

The Hive put the very existence of mankind at stake.<br/><br/>The Victorian in Our Time Line was a period of exploration and scientific achievement, military conflict and colonial conquest and social upheaval.

Mars is home to a race of ancient aliens, powerful dangerous and unpredictable to the minds of men. Their true powers and purposes are shrouded in mystery. It is know that for many thousands of years they have harvested humans from Earth for use as slaves. With this human workforce Mars has been transformed from a lifeless rock into a tropical greenhouse of a world.

A character can perform three types of attack (sword, bow or magic attack), and each attack can be strong, causing great damages, or quick, causing damages more often. The damage intensity depends on the experience in that type of attack. A successful attack increases the experience of the fighter in that type of attack.<br/><br/>SETUP<br/>Players choose randomly who is the Human and who is the Elf.<br/><br/>In a common paper is written down the initial experiences for each type of attack and the initial number of wounds of both characters, as shown below. Another option is to print the board in the section files.<br/><br/>ELF <br/>Wounds: 0<br/>Sword: 2<br/>Bow: 3<br/>Magic: 2<br/><br/>HUMAN<br/>Wounds: 0<br/>Sword: 3<br/>Bow: 2<br/>Magic: 2<br/><br/>ATTACK: TYPES AND MODALITIES<br/>There are three types of attack: sword, bow and magic. For each of those there are two modalities: quick and strong.<br/><br/>So, each player has 6 cards for every possible attack: strong sword, quick sword, strong bow, quick bow, strong magic, quick magic.<br/><br/>You can print the custom cards in the images section. Another options is to use 6 cards, for each player, from an UNO game: two red cards with 1 and 3 values for quick sword and strong sword, two green cards with 1 and 3 values for quick bow and strong bow, two blue cards with 1 and 3 values for quick magic.<br/><br/>Winning order: sword beats bow, bow beats magic and magic beats swords.<br/><br/>TURN<br/>Each player places a face down card in the middle of the table. When both cards are placed, they are revealed.<br/><br/>&bull; With a successful quick attack, the opponent takes a number of wounds equal to the value of experience the winner has in that type of attack.<br/>&bull; With a successful strong attack, the opponent takes a number of wounds equal to the value of experience the winner has in that type of attack multiplied by 3.<br/><br/>After the opponent&rsquo;s damaging, the winner increases his experience in that type of attack by one.<br/><br/>The winning order (sword &gt; bow; bow &gt; magic; magic &gt; swords) determines who has done a successful attack. If both players chooses the same type of attack, the winner is who played a quick attack.<br/><br/>In case both players choose the same type of attack and the same modality, the player with less experience in that type of attack increases by one that type of attack and nobody takes any wounds. In case both players has the same amount of experience neither of them gain experience.<br/><br/>At the end of the turn, the two cards just played stay on the table, aside but in full view and unavailable for the next turn. At the end of the next turn, the new played cards will stay on the table, whereas the cards from the previous turn will return in the players&rsquo; hands.<br/><br/>END OF THE GAME<br/>The game ends when one player reaches a number of wounds greater than or equal to 100. (The game is perfectly scalable, so players can choose any number of wounds as end condition.)<br/><br/>After that, players have to check who will get a bonus attack. Each player subtracts the value in his highest experience with the value his lowest experience. Who has the greater difference makes a number of wounds to the enemy equal to his highest experience multiplied by 3 (like a strong attack). If the differences are equal, whoever has less wounds gets the bonus attack..<br/><br/>The winner is the player with less wounds.<br/><br/>"}, "142332": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Ryan Hackel"], "poll": [], "name": "Star Cargo", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Modular Board", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Point to Point Movement"], "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2297311_t.jpg", "average": "4.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2297311.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Print & play edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Economic", "Print & Play", "Space Exploration", "Transportation"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "You are a merchant in space, traveling throughout the galaxy looking for the best cargo to sell.

It developed and took on extra life in part inspired by the Petty Gods project led by James Maliszewski over at grognardia.blogspot.com. Kudos to one of the OSR heavyweights!<br/><br/>The premise behind Phonomicon ex Cultis is simple. At its heart, it's a table of 100 gods, goddesses and powers to provide a pan-system source of small religions as a springboard for use in your roleplaying game. The concept underpinning this was to take the most common phonemes (or word sounds) in the English language and use them as a basis for generating powers that NPCs worship. If words have power, then do sounds have power too? And if similar sounding words can be grouped by similar meaning, do they take on further strength?<br/><br/>Take AIN as an example - you'll find it in slain, sprain, strain, pain... all words concerning damage and discomfort - and all of a sudden you have AIN, Patron Deity of Injuries. Perhaps the civilised folk known him as Bain, and appeal to him for a quick recovery from wounds; perhaps the barbaric humanoid tribes know him as Tarrainain, and revel in his name as they butcher villages in their path; further still, perhaps the snake-headed Inquisitors of Koth whisper their prayers to Ain'ts'sain as they prepare the torture implements for the next victim.<br/><br/>System Agnostic<br/><br/>This book was designed to be system- and setting-agnostic - that is to say, information is presented in such a way to be readily adapted to use in any campaign, regardless of whether it's any edition of D&D, Palladium, Runequest, or set in Blackmoor, T\u00e9kumel, or Glorantha.<br/><br/>Any mechanic described in this book will be described as a 'bonus' or 'penalty', or a level-dependant amount/adjusted, 'LDA'. The value of each effect is left to the discretion of the GM - in a d20 based system, a bonus may be +1 or +2, whereas in a percentile system, it may be +5% or +10%. Powers may typically be usable 1 or 3 times per day, depending on its strength in a given system. LDA damage or power may involve rolling a d4 for each level of the cultist in D&amp;D, or d6 in Palladium. How these effects are resisted, or if indeed they can be resisted, is up to you. You, GM, are the judge, and you know what works in your system - and if it proves it doesn't, change it.<br/><br/>Using this book<br/><br/>This book is designed to be referenced in two kinds of situations<br/><br/>     A GM designing a dungeon/quest who wants some ideas for potential cults to which the NPC inhabitants might belong<br/>     A GM or player faced with coming up with a new (or alternative name for an existing) obscure religion/cult on the fly<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>What follows is a list of 100 possible patrons for your cult, along with some optional fluff or detail, which can be used as much or as little as you want.

Now you're back in our homeland, and what better way to celebrate your most recent victory than to spend an evening at the Red Dragon Inn. You and your adventuring companions will spend the night drinking, gambling, and roughhousing. The last person who is both sober enough to remain conscious and shrewd enough to hold onto his Gold Coins wins the game.<br/><br/>Now you've taken to the high seas aboard The Crimson Drake, a sturdy sailing vessel that the heroes you know and love use when their adventures take them to sea. Join the crew in the Captain Whitehawk's cabin for a pint and try to keep your sea legs!<br/><br/><br/>    Captain Whitehawk: Captain Whitehawk is the stalwart master of the Crimson Drake. She's a natural leader with years of experience and a wit as sharp as her saber. She&rsquo;ll take the crew to hell and back for adventure and loot, and make damn sure they have a roaring good time while they're at it.<br/>    First Mate Remy: An elf from faraway lands, Remy is an honor-bound swashbuckler who keeps the crew in line; he&rsquo;ll be the first to step in and break up a fight. The seasoned sailors know to back down before they get on his bad side. <br/>    Bryn the Boatswain: Bryn is tough as nails and knows how to keep a ship afloat. When she's not making repairs or loading provisions, she enjoys sparring with the crew&hellip; all of them&hellip; at the same time...<br/>    Tara the Navigator: Tara was born blind, but with the gift of second sight. With her knack for seeing the future, she is an invaluable, if unlikely, navigator for the Crimson Drake. After predicting countless storms and monster attacks she has earned the trust of Captain Whitehawk and her crew.<br/><br/><br/>The Red Dragon Inn 4 includes a Sea Event Deck that provides a new way to play RDI. Instead of the relative safety of the inn, players are now partying in the Captain's cabin aboard the Crimson Drake &ndash; and because you're out on an adventure, the party runs the risk of being interrupted by random encounters. In game terms, at the start of the game you shuffle the Sea Event Deck and place it in the middle of the table with two Progress Counters on it. You then play RDI like normal, but at the end of each player's turn, that player removes a Progress Counter from the Sea Event Deck. When you remove the last Progress Counter, reveal the top card and an Event takes place. The Sea Event Deck adds a new level of complexity to the base game. Not only will you need to protect yourself from the other players, as well as the Drink Deck, but you may find yourself forced to defend against a Sea Event. You could even end up working alongside other players to get a bonus from the various Events you'll see throughout a game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "English second edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "average": "7.3755", "name": "The Red Dragon Inn 4", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Betting/Wagering", "Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": ["217818", "159683", "146329", "125053", "174922", "196213", "158222", "125472", "146330", "168857", "173959", "172873", "151708", "181681", "181535", "181679", "213092"], "usersrated": "418", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "The Red Dragon Inn"]}, "142403": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Old Dragon"], "poll": [], "name": "B\u00e1rbaros", "rpgdesigner": ["Bruno Carlos Lug\u00e3o"], "rpgproducer": ["Bruno Carlos Lug\u00e3o", "Ant\u00f4nio S\u00e1 Neto"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1653056.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version 1.1"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Redbox"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["OD Artigos"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1653056_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Este artigo descreve uma nova classe b&aacute;sica para o Old Dragon.

There are no limits or time setting or story in this game, but only one constant, the Revenge. Son of the comic strip of the Crow, this game was developed over 3 years to allow you to play any revenge story, from the Greek tragedies to the classic Kill Bill, from The Count of Monte Cristo to Old Boy. The mechanics eliminate the figure of the game master distributing this role to all the role players at the table which, in turn, will have to manage the role of Screenwriter of the Chapter. Taking a cue from the movie Kill Bill, the phase of play is divided into chapters each of which deals with antagonists to exact revenge on. Comparisons between the protagonist and his antagonists, PNG or managed by them, will be addressed through a Confrontation Board. Simply rolling the dice and placing them on the table, will help determine who among the players will have a right and duty to narrate the scene of the narrating themes allowing you to add more hands to the development of the story. The simple explanation of the rules and advice in the manual allows a quick understanding of the mechanics and an easy to learn game mechanism ensuring that the players will be able to self-manage. The game can be easily completed in 3-4 hours, but finds its expression in taking advantage of a game session for each chapter, that a session of play for each player. The recommended number of players is 3 to 6.<br/><br/>"}, "142409": {"poll": [], "name": "The Door to Saturn (fan expansion to Arkham Horror)", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Chit-Pull System", "Dice Rolling", "Modular Board", "Point to Point Movement", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2012", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "14", "boardgamefamily": ["Arkham Horror"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1653312_t.jpg", "average": "7.21429", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1653312.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Expansion for Base-game", "Exploration", "Fan Expansion", "Fighting", "Horror", "Print & Play", "Science Fiction"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "The struggle against the Ancient One takes the investigators out of Arkham and into the darkest corners of the globe.

Assuming the wretched state of the French would allow him time to capture the key border fortress of Almeida, Wellington settled in for a leisurely siege. But Mass&eacute;na quickly reorganized his forces and advanced on the British positions in an effort to resupply the beleaguered fortress.<br/><br/>Advancing on Almeida on 3 May, 1811, Mass&eacute;na encountered Wellington's army in strong defensive positions along the Dos Casas River. Heavy fighting erupted, with the British barely managing to hang on to the key terrain. The next day, Mass&eacute;na scouted the area and discovered that the British right was dangerously weak; that evening he conducted a daring night march that put strong forces into position to roll up Wellington's flank. When the French attack struck on the morning of 5 May, the British right nearly collapsed, and only the sacrifice of the British cavalry and heroic performance of Craufurd's Light Division barely managed to save the day.

Actions include things like taking a train car of your choice from the card array, stealing all money from one player, and taking a company token of the color of your choice. The card decks also include two events, and those cards flush either the objective cards on display or the smaller cards that players draft.<br/><br/>When a player claims his fourth objective, each other player takes one more turn, then the game ends.

Buying and selling goods for gold while employing a network of local characters, secret knowledge, hidden locations, bribes, dirty tricks and a healthy dose of cunning to evade the attentions of the customs officers and the other players.<br/><br/>When selling goods, players can choose how much to sell them for; making a choice to either increase their reputation and influence in the community by selling cheaply, or maximising their profit by getting the best price possible.  An increased reputation allows a player to transport their contraband more easily and evade customs, but to win the game they must have the most gold out of all the other players.  However, the higher the price goods are sold for, the stronger the customs forces become&hellip;<br/><br/>Smuggling in Cornwall was rarely performed by just one person; rather large swathes of the community were often involved.  In Cornish Smuggler, players must build a smuggling network by employing characters; each with a unique ability, cost and affect on a smugglers reputation within the local community.<br/><br/>When smuggling goods, the choice of which goods to buy is key. Players can choose to buy big bulky goods, which are hard to fit on board ship (goods and ships are all different shapes and sizes) or smaller more easily transported goods which are worth far less.<br/><br/>Also, different sized  towns will offer different prices for goods.  Smaller towns offer a lower price, but with a lower risk.  Larger towns offer better prices and allow smugglers to sell more goods, but the risk of do so is (generally) much greater.<br/><br/>The customs forces in Cornish Smuggler will move around the board dependant on what the players do.  Landing, moving and selling goods merits their attention although players can also move customs by spending influence or utilising secrets.  Luckily all Customs can be bribed  meaning that once you've bought them they will remain 'your man' until the end of the game...or until another player pays them more.<br/><br/>Although starting off fairly underfunded and under supported, as the game progresses the Customs Officers will get steadily stronger, harder to bribe and more numerous.  As such, it gets harder and harder to smuggle goods effectively, secretly and profitably so each game has a clearly defined end point that is visible to all players<br/><br/>Discovering secret tricks can help a players cause, and there are secret storehouses that can be hired out where you can stash your goods, hiding them from Customs and protecting them from being seized.<br/><br/>There are many possible paths to victory in Cornish Smuggler.  Players will have to adapt their strategy to accommodate the actions of the other players, employ the right characters, buy the right goods, discover the right secrets and make the right deals.<br/><br/>This game is about real things that happened to real people in a real place, thus creating a directly relatable experience between 21st Century Cornwall and Cornwall at a time when the community was experiencing significant poverty and exorbitant taxation.  As a result, smuggling wasn&rsquo;t necessarily seen as something that was illegal, but rather as something that was &lsquo;fair game&rsquo; and as such was taken with an often light hearted view.<br/><br/>What this game is:<br/><br/>Dodging the Law, employing the local vicar, building an network, discovering and using secrets, renting out the mayor's wine cellar, getting rich, a surprisingly accurate historical representation.<br/><br/>What this game isn't:<br/><br/>Ship racing, firing cannons, being a pirate<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "6.06814", "name": "Cornish Smuggler", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Area-Impulse", "Deck / Pool Building", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Point to Point Movement", "Route/Network Building", "Simulation"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "414", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games", "Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: England", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Ep. 1 \u2013 Let\u2019s Say Hello w/ Henry Jasper", "The Board Game Review Room: Cornish Smuggler by Grublin Games", "The Board Room Episode three"]}, "142452": {"poll": [], "name": "Family Business: Blood Brothers and The Moll Expansions", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamecompilation": ["Mayfair Games Limited Edition Promo Expansion Set #3"], "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2013", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1805394_t.jpg", "average": "6.25", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Mayfair Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1805394.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "If you currently control the weakest mob (fewest surviving members), you may take the Blood Brothers tile and place it Blood Brothers side up in front of you.<br/><br/>Blood Brothers: Whenever one of your mobsters is added to the Hit List, you must move one mobster already on the Hit List to the space directly in front of your just-added mobster (effectively making them a higher priority on the Hit List).

You are now ready to begin normally.<br/><br/>Rules: When a log is hit by a stone the log remains where it lands (just like when a stone hits another stone).  Your moose can use a log to cross over the water just like a stone.  However, before moving the moose onto the log you must immediately &quot;roll&quot; the log over and place it roughly where it was positioned.  There are three possible results of a rolled log:<br/><br/>    Logs (2 tiles): If you move onto a log, you must move your front feet to a stone by the end of your turn otherwise your &quot;elk gets wet&quot;.  You may not use the stone the you came from for your front hooves.  If you start your turn on a log, you must be off the log entirely before the end of your turn, otherwise your &quot;elk gets wet&quot;.<br/>    Shaky Stones (1 tile): You may treat this like any stone, but as soon as you have left the tile, the stones are washed away and the tile is removed from the game.<br/>    Bear (1 tile): You can't enter this tile.  This tile remains in play bear side up and may be flicked instead of a stone as a blocker.  If it falls off the table the bear goes into hibernation until the next game.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "Elk Fest: Log Jam!

Other tinkers really don't find this to be unusual at all; in fact, most are so busy with their own little obsessions to really bat an eye at another tinker's source of amusement. Some find themselves drawn to the classic motif of the man at arms; however, rather than honing the art of combat to an instinct, the innovator turns it into a science. Upon beginning the process of translating the idea of combat specialist into something he can understand, the innovator comes to the conclusion that besting those who have been combat specialists their entire lives would be facilitated by confusing them. To achieve this, the innovator starts with one of the most complicated weapons available and starts making it completely incomprehensible to anyone but himself.<br/><br/>The first in a series of prestige classes released every 50 sales of The Tinker: Master of Modular Mechanical Mayhem, The Innovator: A Martial Tinker Prestige Class focuses on getting the tinker out of the back and into the front lines where any self-respecting squad commander will be.<br/><br/>An innovator's signature ability is the acquisition and customization of a signature weapon. Starting off as a standard exotic weapon, the innovator makes five &quot;breakthroughs&quot; over the course of his career, adding robotic arms, an automated mortar, wand slots, flamethrowers, or really sparkly glitter to his weapon. These abilities are contained in three tiered trees: alchemical, construct, and magic. Each time the innovator receives a breakthrough, he can select the lowest remaining tier in one of the three trees, allowing for dozens of possible designs.<br/><br/>His capstone ability, the masterpiece, allows for the further customization of the signature weapon, though the ability may also be spent to bolster the poor automatons he's nearly forgotten this entire time...<br/><br/>The following are examples of breakthroughs.<br/><br/>(Alchemical)<br/><br/>Tier 3 - Integrated Lobtube (Ex): A hopper with the storage capacity to hold five flasks, tanglefoot bags, smokesticks, or other similarly sized alchemical goods now hangs from the innovator's back. A thick hose runs from the hopper to a hollow cylinder attached to the innovator's signature weapon. Once per round using its own action, a signature weapon with the integrated lobtube breakthrough can launch a single object held in the hopper at a creature within 60 feet. Treat this as a ranged attack made by the innovator using his signature weapon. If the signature weapon is a melee weapon, treat it as a non-improvised ranged weapon for the purpose of this breakthrough. If the attack hits, it deals 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage and the alchemical good activates. If the attack misses, the alchemical good scatters 1d4 x 5 feet in a random direction and activates where it lands. Reloading the hopper is a standard action for each item added to it that benefits from the Rapid Reload feat. Should the innovator's signature weapon ever leave the radius of his master's presence class feature, the lobtube ceases to function.<br/><br/>(Construct)<br/><br/>Tier 1 - Mounted Mini-Crossbow (Ex): The innovator mounts a small crossbow on his signature weapon. Whenever the innovator deals damage to a creature within 30 feet of the innovator with his signature weapon, the crossbow fires, dealing an additional 1d4 points of piercing damage. The crossbow reloads automatically, but only does so at the beginning of the innovator's turn.<br/><br/>"}, "142478": {"poll": [], "name": "R.I.P.
