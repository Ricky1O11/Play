Printed on each piece is the shape of the kind of opponents&rsquo; piece it can capture: square, hex or round.<br/><br/>Each player has one square piece that can capture opposing square pieces, one square piece that can capture opposing hex pieces and one square piece that can capture opposing round pieces. The same is true for hex pieces and round pieces.<br/><br/>The playing board is triangular shaped with 3 types of sections: 3 Nests (where pieces start the game), 3 Pens (where captured pieces go) and the Ring (a center section where the action takes place).<br/><br/>Pieces start the game in their nest and move directly to any empty space in the ring. They capture opponents&rsquo; pieces by moving straight-line to, and replacing, the captured piece in its space. The captured piece is sent to the Pen.<br/><br/>When a piece moves into capture position on an opponent&rsquo;s piece, prior to capturing it, it can &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; the opposing piece by flipping it over. The flipped piece is frozen (cannot move) for one turn.<br/><br/>There a 3 types of normal moves: Nest-to-Ring (described above), swapping a piece from the Pen with a piece in the Ring and moving a piece inside the Ring.<br/><br/>There is one special moved called a &ldquo;release&rdquo;, which can occur in a 3-player game if a player is getting &ldquo;ganged up on&rdquo; or it can be considered a handicap move for beginning players.

No figures are removed, so it is not critical how figures are based.  Suggested basing is 2 figures for infantry skirmishers and cavalry, and 4 figures (in two ranks) for non-skirmish infantry.  The typical units are 3 stands of cavalry (regiment) or a mixture of pike and shot stands for infantry (1 pike and 2 shot for a Swedish/Dutch regiment and up to 36 figures for a Tercio).  The scale is 1 figure = 50 men and 1&quot; = 50 yards.<br/><br/>Significant features of the rules:<br/><br/>- Each command group of units is given a standing order which it must follow.  Units continue to follow these orders until a new order is sent from the overall commander.  If the overall commander is too far away from the command, there will be delays in adopting the new order.<br/><br/>- No figures are removed when damage occurs--units simply receive Disorder Markers (DM).  When ordinary units have accumulated 2 or more DM's (Tercios 4 or more DM), the unit becomes &quot;unformed&quot; and is unable to move at full speed and is less effective in fighting (e.g., unformed pikes are no longer at an advantage vs. cavalry).  Units automatically rally off disorder markers at a rate given by their morale and other attributes, and additional DM's can be rallied off if the unit remains stationary or has an attached commander.<br/><br/>- Melees are resolved in multi-round battles until one side routs or is eliminated.  Losers of a round will accumulate Disorder Markers and be pushed back.  At some point, one side or other will rout and begin to retreat off the board.<br/><br/>- Once a player loses a certain percentage of its units (depending on the army), units begin to retreat towards their board edge.<br/><br/>No army lists are included, but scenarios are included which may give examples of typical units.  Scenarios included are: Seminara (French vs. Spanish, 1495), Barletta (French vs. Spanish, 1502), Otumba (Spanish vs. Aztecs, 1520), Pavia (French vs. Imperial, 1525), Breitenfeld (Sweden vs. Catholic League, 1631), and Rocroi (French vs. Spanish, 1643).<br/><br/>"}, "42079": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Mark Manning"], "poll": [], "name": "Dodge-a-Roid", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Print & Play", "Science Fiction"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "You are an alien space craft back from the holidays.

Colbert is a board game designer and puzzle and game manufacturer. An advertising executive, he came up with the idea of marketing a real estate trading game called Hometown Monopoly in which the properties on the board that are purchased and rented would be actual businesses in the hometown of the person purchasing the game. He produced his first game in 1980 for the city of Oshkosh, Wisconsin. He and a good friend, Arnold Miller of La Crescent, Minnesota held the copyrights and trademarks for the Hometown Monopoly series of boardgames through their holding company, Milco, Inc. Colbert incorporated Citigames of America, Inc. in 1982, and with that company and Hometown Productions, both Milco licensees,  went on to produce localized monopoly games for over 500 cities and towns in the United States and Canada. In 1985, Colbert developed Hometown Trivia and began to market that series of board games through Colbert Productions and Butler Games, Ltd. In 1986, Colbert marketed Puzzlement, a localized jigsaw puzzle that was sold only in Oshkosh and is a rare find today.<br/>   In 1988, Colbert sold the Trademark rights to the name Hometown Monopoly to Parker Brothers, Inc., producer of the famous MONOPOLY board game, licensing back from them the right to continue to produce his games in the cities and towns where he had developed versions of that game. In 1996, Colbert produced his last Hometown Monopoly game, fittingly an updated version of his original Oshkosh Monopoly.<br/>   Also in 1996, Colbert shifted his publishing focus from board games to magazines, building a second successful business with The Apartment Directory and The Builders Guide, both magazines serving the Fox Valley region of Wisconsin.<br/>   Colbert's Hometown Monopoly games for Baltimore and Washington DC led to his involvement with the nation-wide unification event, Hands Across America, which earned him an invitation to President Ronald Reagan's Second Inaugural Ball.<br/>    Today, David A.

The rules are even able to incorporate the some of the more problematic aspects of modern operations such as air support, artillery barrages, fortifications, smoke screens, engineering operations and so forth into the same fast-play, narrative based system.<br/><br/>Despite being deceptively simple in appearance, the Combat Cards provide a very challenging game full of hard choices and long range planning. The fact that every card can offer multiple options, that there is no way of knowing exactly when certain cards will appear in a player's hand, and that not every unit will be available at all times (e.g. due to combat effects, confusion, etc.) forces players to carefully weigh the benefits and risks of almost every tactical decision within the framework of their overall strategic plan.<br/><br/>In addition, with the incorporation of expansion decks, even more challenge and detail can be easily added to the base game. This allows players to customize the rules to the level of complexity they most enjoy.<br/><br/>And if folks prefer their battles more in the form of a traditional board game, the Combat Cards can be combined with the new Tactical Assault: Legendary Battles&trade; print-n-play packs. These sets give Combat Card players everything they need to play exciting battles in a hex and counter style format - including unique scenarios, beautiful full color maps and more than enough counters to allow players to develop their own scenarios. The only thing the players need to provide is their own Combat Card decks!<br/><br/>All of this is offered in an easy to download print-n-play format available at the Tactical Assault Games website - along with articles on tactics, tips &amp; tricks, designer's notes and more!<br/><br/>"}, "42225": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "F\u0101ngq\u00ed", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic478212_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Public Domain)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic478212.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Square chess (\u65b9\u68cb f\u0101ngq&iacute;), also known as \u4e22\u65b9(di\u016bf\u0101ng) and \u4e0b\u65b9(xi&agrave;f\u0101ng), is an abstract strategy board game played traditionally in the northwestern regions of China, especially Ningxia, Gansu, Shaanxi, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and other areas with a high concentration of Chinese Muslims. The game is also played by Dungans, who have brought the game with them to Central Asian countries such as Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>The game is played on a 7x8 grid, with pieces played on the points, much as in Go. Players take turns alternately placing stones until the board has been filled up, attempting to form 2x2 squares with their pieces. When the board has been filled up, players each remove one of their opponent's stones. The player then counts up the squares that he/she has formed and removes an equal number of the opponent's pieces, as long as those pieces are not part of a square. After the initial removal of pieces, players take turns moving pieces; pieces can move any distance along the grid up, down, left, or right. Every time a square is formed, the player can remove one of the opponent's pieces(again, as long as this piece is not part of a square). The player who removes all of the opponent's pieces first is the winner. Thus, the game is similar in concept to Nine Men's Morris.<br/><br/>Playing equipment<br/><br/>The game can be played on any 7x8 board using black or white go stones, even on the intersections of a chessboard. The game is popular in agricultural communities in northwestern China, and often played on a board traced out on the ground.<br/><br/>Variants<br/><br/>The Xinjiang variant of square chess is played on a 7x7 board. Because this leads to an odd number of playing points (49) the first player has an advantage. Thus, the second player is allowed to remove one more piece from his/her opponent during the initial removal of pieces.<br/><br/>Other variants of the game allow encirclement of pieces, as in Go. Still other variants disallow certain moves, for example, forming a square in the same way repeatedly (similar to the ko rule in Go).<br/><br/>Because of the game's popularity among country folk in rural areas, there are a great many variants of the game, each local to a specific area.<br/><br/>"}, "42226": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "O Shlemiel", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Set Collection", "Trick-taking"], "yearpublished": "1975", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "7", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic474291_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Originals Only"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic474291.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Number", "Word Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "&quot;Card games with Yiddish&quot;.<br/><br/>This game comes with a double deck of standard cards with several extras: In the lower left, a letter A-Z; upper right, a number 1-52; and in the center, a Yiddish word or phrase, with its English translation.

English version distributed by BANDAI AMERICA. The game is anime stylized but is not based on an anime (until later versions) it was created by Michael Elliot, game designer for MTG, and also creator of Duel Masters.<br/><br/>There are six different categories of cards. Each represented by a different Gem stone. Ruby, Diamond, Amethyst, Sapphire, Topaz, and Emerald. Each gem set possesses specific powers, abilities, and types of spirits which are unique to each gem set.<br/><br/>The game is based around a &quot;core&quot; concept. Each player begins with 5 life which is represented by gems included with the game; also players begin with 4 &quot;core&quot; in their reserve that are also represented by the same gems used to indicate your life total. The goal of the game is to reduce your opponents life to zero, or through &quot;crushing&quot; your opponents deck so they can no longer draw any cards.<br/><br/>As players receive damage from their opponents actions their life transfers from your life area to your reserve where you can pay for spirits, spells, and nexus's essentially adding a balance to the game; so that even though you may be on the receiving end of an assault you are gaining the ability to respond with a counter attack. Your reserve refreshes at the beginning of every turn with each core you had spent on the previous turn and you gain 1 additional core every turn.<br/><br/>The game at its base is very simplistic, but as you play in more advanced degrees it tends to have a &quot;poker&quot; feel to it, as you can bluff and certain plays give away &quot;tells&quot; and whatnot, it takes about 45 minutes to play a match (best 2 of 3 games)<br/><br/>Although the game requires basic strategy, there is a lot of involvement in the deck building process, because your resources are on a differing track from your deck there is no mulligan, such as in MTG, however you only begin with 4 core in reserve so you want to include spirits and cards in your deck that work with your &quot;core&quot; production curve. This concept makes a large portion of the spirits and spells in the game to be very attractive to deck building which makes individual cards very cost effective.<br/><br/>Battle Spirits is currently on it's 4th edition with the 5th set releasing Sept. 10th. It is relatively unknown because it is only distributed to local hobby retailers and online hobby stores. It is currently unknown when the game will hit the mass market, but is expected to gain high popularity with the younger crowd as the anime will be hitting US airways hopefully in the spring of 2011.<br/><br/>BANDAI AMERICA will send you a free demo deck (all constructed with cards from the first set) they are white backed which indicates they are not approved for sanctioned tournament play, however they are adequate for casual gaming and can give you a good taste of the game mechanics.<br/><br/>For more information please see Bandaicg.com/battlespirits regarding how to play, how to obtain your free demo deck, you can also watch videos on YouTube by searching for &quot;Bandai CG&quot;.<br/><br/>On behalf of the Battle Spirits community, I warmly welcome you to the game! <br/>-Brandon Anderson (Top 8 X-championship GenCon 2010)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Demo Deck First edition"], "name": "Battle Spirits: Trading Card Game", "playingtime": "45", "average": "7.185", "usersrated": "20", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Customizable Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Anime & Manga", "CCGs (Collectible Card Games)"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Game Gab: Origins 2009: Bandai"]}, "42258": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Bruno Murphy"], "poll": [], "name": "Endango", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Children's Games"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic471363_t.jpg", "average": "3.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Elastic Earth"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic471363.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Elastic Earth Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Educational", "Environmental"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Endango is an environmental board game that teaches kids how to go green.

It was the era of soldier-kings and enlightened monarchs, when powerful states maneuvered professional armies and fought to gain rich provinces. FW is primarily intended as a multi-player player game. It can be played by two, three or four, with each player representing a different major power: Prussia, Austria, France or Britain. Other states are represented as minor powers. Each player has a variety of military and diplomatic instruments with which he can attempt to make his mark on history.<br/><br/>FW&rsquo;s system is based on our earlier-published 1066 and Hannibal&rsquo;s War games; however, there have been changes to the rules to reflect the differences in scale as well as the era being covered.<br/><br/>The square-grid map shows Europe from London to East Prussia and south to the Balkans and central Italy. Off-map areas are handled using holding boxes. Each game turn represents one year. Each military unit represents 2,500 to 10,000 men. Each square represents 50 miles (81 km) across from side to opposite side. Designed by Joseph Miranda<br/><br/>Rules cover such things as: the balance of power, negotiations, mobilization, fog of war, honors of war, fortresses, sieges, forced march, ambush, delaying actions, pillage, leaders, veteran and guard units, fleets, fieldworks, minor powers, declaring war, the Holy Roman Empire, prisoners of war and much more.

Consequently, many military systems developed along divergent lines until the time of the widespread use of gunpowder, which dominated Renaissance warfare. Black Prince: Crecy &amp; Navarette (BP) reflects that diversity by simulating two battles, both of which represented a clash of distinct weapons and tactics.<br/><br/>Navarette is a simulation of the conflict between English and Castilian forces and their French allies near the Spanish village of Najera on 3 April 1347, during the Hundred Years War. The battle marked the culmination of the Black Prince&rsquo;s campaign to overthrow the usurper Henry the Bastard and regain the throne of Castille for the rightful king, Pedro the Cruel. The scales are 50 yards per hex, 500 men per standard counter, 1,500 per double-length counter, and 20 minutes per game turn.<br/><br/>At Crecy, in 1346, the French knights in Philip&rsquo;s army were the elite of the country, and felt themselves to be the epitome of chivalry. That led them to treat the foot soldiers of both sides with contempt. Thus, when charging, only English knights were worthy of their attention. Also, when their own archers faltered before the hail of English arrows, they saw them as cowards and traitors not worthy of being on the field.

Rivals around the Baltic Sea seize the opportunity to get their hands on Swedish territory. An alliance is struck between Denmark, Saxony-Poland, and Russia, the last under the vibrant leadership of Tsar Pyotr. This coalition mobilizes to take advantage of the untried King, and break Swedish dominance in the Baltics forever... Thus opened the Great Northern War, ravaging Northern and Eastern Europe for over two decades at the beginning of the eighteenth century. By the end of the war, one nation would lose its status as a Great Power, while another would rise to dominate the region for centuries onward.<br/><br/>PAX BALTICA is a two-player wargame covering the entire Great Northern War (1700-1721). Published first as a limited &ldquo;guerilla&rdquo; edition in 2009 by Three Crowns Game Productions of Sweden, this new enhanced edition has been revised and upgraded by GMT Games in conjunction with the original designers.<br/><br/>Over twenty years of fighting span the map from Norway to Turkey, Saxony to Finland. Units are represented by labeled wooden blocks, which are stood upright to conceal their identity and strength from the enemy, allowing players to dupe and outfox each other on campaign. Action points are spent to maneuver on the map, but also for reconnaissance, replacements, or a roll on the treacherous but lucrative National Politics Table. Straightforward rules account for lines of communication and forage, as well as time-consuming sieges, adding to the period flavor. The fast-paced and exciting combat system captures the aggressive &quot;charge with cold steel&quot; tactics that Sweden used to defeat her enemies in succession at the start of the war.<br/><br/>Players are subject to a host of influences and distractions that will hinder their plans at every turn. An elaborate plan will be at the mercy of a poor action roll or sudden plague, while other events shape strategy with historical motivations and deterrents. Players must prepare for the worst, but be open to fleeting opportunities.<br/><br/>Special rules capture simply the unique events and circumstances of the Great Northern War, including:<br/>&bull; Russian army reforms<br/>&bull; Ukrainian Cossack uprisings<br/>&bull; Intervention by the Ottoman Empire<br/>&bull; Polish royal politics<br/>&bull; Attrition of Swedish manpower<br/>&bull; Founding of Sankt-Peterburg<br/><br/>Four scenarios are included with the game: a short tournament scenario covering the Swedish invasion of Russia that led to the Battle of Polt&aacute;va; two scenarios that simulate the first and last half of the war; and a &ldquo;grand campaign&rdquo; scenario that refights the entirety of the Great Northern War, a first in wargame publishing. Turns typically take no more than a couple of minutes, ensuring a fast pace of play. Swings of fortune ensure that no two games will turn out the same.<br/><br/>Can you save Sweden&rsquo;s empire? Or ensure Russia&rsquo;s rise to prominence? You make the choices that will determine who reigns over the PAX BALTICA.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>&bull; 1 Map (22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo;)<br/>&bull; 1 Rulebook (16 pages)<br/>&bull; 1 Playbook (32 pages)<br/>&bull; 65 wooden blocks (units) in five colors<br/>&bull; 1 sticker sheet for mounting on blocks<br/>&bull; 51 wooden cubes (control markers, etc.) in six colors<br/>&bull; 8 dice, 4 blue and 4 green<br/><br/>Game Design: Stefan Ekstr&ouml;m and G&ouml;ran Bj&ouml;rkman<br/>Development for GMT: Scott Muldoon<br/>Complexity: 4<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 3<br/>Scale: Strategic. 1 turn = one season; units are armies, regiments, and fleets; 1 strength step = approx. 1500 troops or 6-8 fighting ships<br/>Players: 2<br/>Time to Play: 1-2 hours for the shortest scenario, 7-14 hours for the grand campaign<br/><br/><br/>Original Three Crowns edition:<br/><br/>Great Northern war, a 21-year long war lasted from 1700 to 1721 and ended Sweden&rsquo;s period as a major power in northern Europe and started Russia&rsquo;s domination of Eastern Europe. An intriguing conflict that is often considered a side-show of the War of Spanish succession. Nevertheless the former had probably greater impact of the developments in Europe during the 100 years to come than the latter. The effects of the war are in fact still seen today.<br/><br/>Pax Baltica. Probably the first board game ever covering the entire Great Northern War.  The game includes five different scenarios with a varying playtime between two hours and a day. The units in the game are blocks which give a great flexibility in taking steps and differentiate the quality and strength of the troops. The high quality map is divided into provinces which you have to conquer in order to take control over a country. This dynamic conflict covers large parts of northern and eastern Europe. From Bremen in the West to Smolensk in the East. From Trondheim in the North to Bender in the South.<br/>Playable nations are Sweden, Russia, Turkey, Denmark and Saxony. Other countries represented as minors are: Great Britain, Poland, Ukraine, Prussia and Hanover. The game, packed in a book case, includes a A2 full color map, 60 high quality wooden blocks, 4 dice, various markers and rules including 5 scenarios.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["GMT edition", "Three Crown Games edition"], "average": "7.39164", "name": "Pax Baltica", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Simulation"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "256", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Block wargames", "Cities: Tallinn", "Country: Sweden", "Guerrilla Print"]}, "42329": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Dora Adventure Game Book", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Children's Games"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic479818_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Flair Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic479818.jpg", "boardgamefamily": ["TV Series: Dora the Explorer"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The all new Dora Adventure Game Book from Flair contains 6 action packed games with your favourite explorer.<br/><br/>Dora and Boots need your help to return books to the library!

It will stretch your mind as you look for circles among the triangles.<br/><br/>Circle Out! game is one of the great modern classics. It calls upon parts of your brain that rarely get much exposure. For this reason, little children can often gain an advantage over adults who are just beginning to learn the game. Playing the game is an excellent visual memory exercise. Circle Out is filled with strategy &ndash; and winning is never a simple matter of chance.<br/><br/>Instructions:<br/><br/>To play the game shuffle the deck and lay out 12 - 16 cards on the table. All players must race to find the most circles of the largest size.<br/><br/>Players should not touch the cards until a circle has been found. When you find one, say &quot;Circle!&quot; and then you may take the cards that form your circle.<br/><br/>One predetermined player will lay out additional cards to replace the ones that have been taken. Continue to play until all of the cards are gone. Two decks may be combined to lengthen the game.<br/><br/>What? Circles? All I can see are triangles! Think of each card as a link that belongs to a chain. A circle happens when the ends of your chain come (link) together.<br/><br/>Just remember that same colors link together and that triangles on the top may only link to triangles on the bottom and vice versa. For example, a blue triangle at the bottom right corner of a card will link to any blue triangle at the top left corner of another card.<br/><br/>Scoring:<br/><br/>Circles of three are worth 1 point, circles of four are worth 2 points, circles of five are worth 3 points, circles of six are worth 4 points and circles of seven cards are worth 5 points.<br/><br/>Or just subtract 2 from the total number of cards in your circle and that is how many points it is worth. For example, a five-card circle is worth 3 points (5 - 2 = 3).<br/><br/>There can be up to seven cards per circle only because there are only seven colors. Each color may only be represented once in each circle by one top triangle and one bottom triangle.<br/><br/>"}, "42404": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Pitch: Chicago Cubs", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Simulation"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Cities: Chicago (Illinois, USA)", "Country: USA", "Sports Teams: Chicago Cubs", "Sports: Baseball"], "maxplayers": "24", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic474337_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Sports Games International"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic474337.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Sports Games International Tin Box edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Sports", "Trivia"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Contents:<br/>70 Pitch cards each with six baseball questions and answers based on Chicago Cubs history<br/>Baseball diamond game mat<br/>Instructions for play<br/><br/>Two teams of players vie to answer the most trivia questions, each question being worth a single, double, triple or home run.

Depending on where the food piece was on the board, it can have various amounts of points (the amount of points is given on each piece next to the picture with the food). Three pieces (with the navy blue background) have the greatest punctual value (6 points), but when carrying it, the player moves one space less then what was rolled on the die. The collected points are added together. The game ends after a player gets the amount of points that was determined upon earlier, or after there are no more food pieces on the game board (the total amounts to 72 points).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Trefl Multi-lingual Edition"], "name": "Tom and Jerry", "playingtime": "25", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "average": "5", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Children's Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Cats", "Animals: Mice"]}, "42470": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic476784.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Gil d'Orey"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Jo\u00e3o Menezes"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Majora"], "maxplaytime": "70", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic476784_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "70", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Medieval"], "description": "Aljubarrota is a cooperative game for 3 to 6 players, but it can be played solo as well.<br/><br/>The game elements try to reproduce faithfully the events of the battle of Aljubarrota at the same time trying to teach some of the curious battle facts that made Nuno &Aacute;lvares Pereira one of the finest military Portuguese strategists.<br/><br/>To be published on the last trimester of 2009 by Majora.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "average": "6.27292", "name": "Aljubarrota", "playingtime": "70", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play"], "age": "7", "usersrated": "48", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Portugal"]}, "42471": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Terry Goodchild"], "poll": [], "name": "Championship Boxing", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "8", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Boxing", "Sports: Combat Sports / Martial Arts"], "average": "7.75", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Lambourne Games", "Owzat Games"], "boardgameversion": ["Lambourne First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Sports"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "From the Publishers website:<br/><br/>Championship Boxing is intended to be a realistic simulation of top-class boxing producing accurate results and incorporating all the relevant factors such as boxing skill, punching power, stamina etc. Considerable thought has been given to a system of play that captures some of the 'feel' of boxing, while still playing quickly. Once the play mechanics have been thoroughly grasped each round takes only on to two minutes to play and each bout can be set up and the Scorecard prepared in about five minutes. It is thus feasible to fight a whole series of bouts in an evening's play, quickly building up statistics and rankings for all weight divisions.<br/><br/>The ratings will, of course be contentious. Everyone has their own opinion about the qualities of their own favourite fighter. All I can say is that each rating has been carefully researched, contemporary fight reports have been studied where possible, different opinions have been carefully weighed and several sources have been examined in arriving at the final figures. If you disagree with any rating try to clear your mind of bias and prejudice an if you still disagree, change it! As the purchaser the game is presented entirely for your pleasure, don't let my opinions spoil it for you!<br/><br/>On the subject of alteration of ratings the game does have another function beyond the mere replay angle. It can be used to answer some otherwise unanswerable questions. Not just, 'Who was the best, Marciano or Ali? But questions like, 'How good could Henry Cooper have been if he had not been so vulnerable to cutting around the eyes?. Would Sugar Ray Leonard have been the world's greatest ever welterweight if he had had the hitting power of Thomas Hearns? Would Floyd Paterson have been a great champion if he had had a sounder chin? The answers are there for you to  explore, just change those rating!

A standard 52 card pack, without joker, is used. The cards rank in the usual order: A (highest) K Q J T 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 (lowest).<br/><br/>Deal and play are clockwise. Each player receives 3 cards. The rest of the cards are laid face down in a pile on the table (stock).<br/><br/>Object of the game<br/>Skitgubbe has two phases. In the first phase players collect cards for the second phase. In the second phase the object is to get rid of one's cards as fast as possible. The last player left with cards in hand is the loser and becomes the skitgubbe.<br/><br/>Play in the first phase<br/>The first phase consists of tricks of 2 cards. The player to dealer's left leads first. Any card can be led and the player to the left of the leader plays any card to complete the trick. At this stage the suits have no significance and there is no requirement to follow suit. Each player draws a card from the stock immediately after playing, so that each player always has a hand of three cards so long as there are still cards in the stock. Whoever played the higher card wins the trick, places the two cards face down in front of himself, and leads to the next trick. If the player who led wins the trick, he leads again and the same two players are involved in the next trick.<br/><br/>If the two cards played to a trick are equal it is called a stunsa (bounce); the cards are left on the table, the two players each draw a card from the stock and the same player leads again. This continues until one of the players wins the trick and takes all the cards played, including the cards from the tied tricks.<br/><br/>In this first phase, the second player to a trick is under no obligation to try to beat the card led. If a low card is led the second player may wish to play lower and give the trick to the leader, for it is important to collect strong cards in the first phase of the game, so gain an advantage in the second phase.<br/><br/>Throughout the first phase, when it is your turn to play and there is still more than one card in the stock, instead of playing from your hand you may turn up the top card of the stock. If you turn a card from the stock you must play it - you may not put it in your hand.<br/><br/>The last card from the stock determines the trump suit for the second phase. The player who has to draw this card takes it but does not add it to his hand but keeps it face down until the first phase is over.<br/><br/>When the stock is exhausted, the play continues as long as possible with the cards players have in their hands. If some players have cards left in hand at the end of the first phase they keep them for the second phase. If the final trick of the first phase is a bounce, the players take back the cards they played to it and keep them for the second phase.<br/><br/>Play in the second phase<br/>The players have now divided the 52 cards between themselves, but the cards are probably not divided equally; some players have more cards than others. The player who drew the trump card leads. The object is to get rid of one's cards as fast as possible.<br/><br/>Now you must either beat the previous card played or pick it up. A card may be beaten by a higher card of the same suit, and a non-trump may be beaten by any trump. It is never lawful to duck. If you cannot or do not wish to beat the card in front of you, you must take it up into your hand, and it is then the next player's turn to lead to a new trick. If there is more than one card lying on the table and you cannot beat the last card played, it is only this last card which you must take up into your hand. It is then the next player's turn to beat the card which was underneath it.<br/><br/>A trick is complete when either:<br/><br/>the number of cards in it is equal to the number of players who were in the game when the trick began, or <br/>all its cards have been picked up. <br/>In the first case, the cards in the trick are set aside and the player who played last (and therefore highest) to the trick leads to the next. In the second case, the player to the left of the player who picked up the last card leads to a new trick. <br/>Suppose there are 3 players; player A has led and player B beaten A's card. If C now beats B's card, C puts aside the cards and leads to the next trick; but if C does not beat B's card but picks it up, it is now A's turn to beat the card showing on the table (which is in fact A's own lead). If A does this, and then B beats A's card, it is B who has completed the trick; B sets aside the three cards and leads to the next trick. Another possibility is: A leads, B beats A's card, C picks up B's card, and A picks up his own card. It is now B's lead.<br/><br/>Note that as players run out of cards, the number of cards in each trick reduces. If there are three players, one of whom runs out of cards during a trick, that trick still requires three cards to be completed (or all its cards to be picked up), but the next trick will require only two cards.<br/><br/>For example suppose there are 3 players: A, B, C. A leads his last card, B beats it, C picks B's card up, B beats A's card again, and now C beats B's card. The trick is now over, and C leads to the next trick. As there are now only two players, the new trick will have only two cards. Another example with three players: A leads; B beats with his last card, C picks this card up, and A picks up the card he led. It is now B's lead and the next trick will be complete with two cards.<br/><br/>A player who gets rid of all his cards can draw a sigh of relief, for he is not the loser. The loser is the player who is left with the last card in his hand, and is called &quot;Skitgubbe&quot; (or &quot;Mas&quot; or &quot;Mattis&quot;). Skitgubbe means &quot;dirty old man&quot; (in the sense of unwashed, rather than obscence); Mas and Mattis mean fool.&quot;<br/><br/>- Description and rules credited to John McLeod from his excellent website here:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href='http://www.pagat.com/beating/mattis.html' rel='nofollow'>http://www.pagat.com/beating/mattis.html</a><br/><br/>"}, "42478": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Pharaoh's Bluff", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Voting"], "yearpublished": "1997", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Egypt"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)"], "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Ancient", "Bluffing"], "age": "13", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A board game where player's try to answer questions to be the first on top of the pyramid.

The siege of Alesia is considered one of Caesar's greatest military achievements, and is still one of the classic examples of siege warfare and circumvallation.<br/>Now, in this game free to download and play, as Caesar, You will defend a system of ramparts, forts and awesome fortifications with units representing legion cohorts, leaders, archers, Germanic cavalry and, as Vergingetorix, you will assault the Roman besiegers with infantry and cavalry units from 46 Gallic tribes.

In LCBG you play 3 rounds, scoring at the end of all 3 for the monuments you collect. (Normal scoring occurs each round.) In Keltis, you only play 1 round, and score everything each round. This is not just a rule difference, as the scoring is different for the monuments/stones based on the number collected.<br/><br/>2. In Keltis, you may play your cards in either order, descending, high to low, or ascending, low to high. In LCBG, you must play in ascending order.<br/><br/>Note: the rules for LCBG have the Keltis rules as variants, and have the board elements necessary for #1 above. Keltis does not have the rules nor board elements to play LCBG.<br/><br/><br/>     Kosmos (Keltis publisher) changed the card play to ascending and descending order to lower the luck level and add balance to the game.<br/>     Kosmos changed the theme to fit in with other Kosmos abstract game series. <br/><br/><br/>There are more differences, which are non-substantive. Lost Cities: The Board Game has a different-looking board, tiles and figures (meeples) to connect with its predecessor. Card-play in descending order is an optional variant in this edition. The numbers have been multiplied by 5 to strengthen the relation to the card game, and instead of a scoring track you collect your points as golden coins.<br/><br/><br/>From the Keltis entry:<br/><br/>Players play cards to move their playing pieces along stone paths. There are cards with 5 different colors/symbols, each corresponding to one path; in addition, each card shows a number (0-10, twice each). In each color, each player can play his cards either ascending or descending. Like Lost Cities, it's better to concentrate on a few paths, since the last spaces grants high points, but ending early gives negative ones.<br/><br/>The player in turn plays one card (out of a hand of 8), or discards one. He moves the corresponding playing piece on the path. Many of the spaces have a token that grants some bonus - either direct points (counted on the scoring track), an extra move on a path, or wish stones that are needed at game end to avoid negative points.<br/><br/>The game ends when a total of 5 playing pieces have reached the 7th space (or more) on their paths. Now, scoring happens:<br/><br/><br/>     Pieces which only moved 1-3 steps give negative points (-4, -3, -2).<br/>     Pieces with 4+ steps grant points (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10).<br/>     One piece of each player is higher and scores double.<br/>     Fewer than two wish stones grants negative points (-3 / -4)<br/>     5+ wish stones yield a bonus of 10 points.<br/>     All this is added to the points scored during the game<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "English second edition", "Russian edition"], "average": "6.83578", "name": "Lost Cities: The Board Game", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Set Collection"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "2783", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Lost Cities"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["17.
