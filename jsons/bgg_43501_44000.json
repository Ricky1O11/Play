Both games use area movement and the same combat/game system. CHE is the introductory game in the system and Cuban Revolution builds upon the basic concepts used in CHE adding in Air, Naval, and Artillery units as well as more advanced game concepts.<br/><br/>CUBAN REVOLUTION: Beginning in February, 1958 Castro began the first Guerrilla offensive by coming out of the Sierra Maesta Mountains and attacking the Bastiano troops in the plains. The Bastiano army counter-attacked in June of 1958, driving the Guerrillas back into the mountains. When the Bastiano army attempted to destroy the Guerrillas in their mountain strongholds, the Bastiano army was all but destroyed itself. With all the newly acquired weapons, the Guerrillas launched a final offensive that ended in the only major battle of the war at the town of Santa Clara. The defeat of the Bastiano Western forces caused the rest of the army to begin deserting. When Fulgencia Batista fled in January of 1959, the Guerrillas triumphantly declared the island was officially free. The improbable victory of the Guerrillas resulted in the only communist country in the Western Hemisphere.<br/><br/>CHE: In March, 1967 the situation in Bolivia was chaotic and the country was ripe for the exportation of &quot;The Cuban Revolution&quot;.  Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara was sent to Bolivia to begin a revolution which ultimately failed due to the intervention of the CIA and US Green Berets who trained three elite Bolivian ranger battalions who captured &quot;Che&quot; Guevara and later executed him thus ending the Communist threat in Bolivia.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"30902": "English first edition"}, "age": "12", "name": "Communism in the West: Cuba 1958 and Boliva 1967", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "average": "6.33333", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": {"10648": "Country: Cuba"}}, "43523": {"rpgitemversion": {"68093": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Worlds of the Dead", "rpgproducer": {"35435": "Davis Chapman"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic520680.jpg", "usersrated": "7", "average": "6.28571", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"343": "All Flesh Must Be Eaten"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "rpggenre": {"28957": "Horror (Zombies)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic520680_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the book.<br/><br/><br/>At first, you thought it was a plague.<br/>Then you thought maybe it's an after-school special.<br/>Now you know.<br/>It's a front row seat for the end of worlds!<br/><br/>Worlds of the Dead is the first Deadworlds collection for the All Flesh Must Be Eaten roleplaying game of survival horror.

However, under the command of Admiral Cain there is no place for compassion or mercy. Now brutal necessity and hard choices erode humanity's moral compass. The Cylons, in turn, are changing as well.

We loved the simple percentile combat. We enjoyed the hit points that didn't skyrocket as leveled increased. The light 'Space Opera' feel was right at home to those of us worshiping the early Star Wars films. But we weren't going to wait to see if TSR was going to develop the system further - so we took it and ran with it in true homebrew style. Strike Force grew over the years - played by nearly 100 people and eventually reached its current state. Though the rules now feel a bit dated (given the era in which it was created), it's simple and free!<br/><br/>From the book:<br/><br/>Strike Force is a role-playing game (RPG).  If you have never experienced a role-playing game before, then this is likely to be unlike any game you have ever tried  (I rather like the term experienced rather than played since role-playing is much more of an experience than most other games).  If you are venturing over from another RPG, then read along and explore the well balanced world of Strike Force.<br/><br/>Role playing is much like the old game of &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Pretend&rdquo; you may have played as a child.  With &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Pretend&rdquo; you pretend to be a cowboy, a sheriff, a good guy or a bad guy.  Often times you would run around with your friends and &ldquo;act-out&rdquo; scenes as if in a TV Show or movie.  A role-playing game simply provides much the same activity only with pencil, paper, dice and a good imagination (actually the imagination is basically the same as &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Pretend&rdquo;).<br/><br/>Strike Force is a game of imagination and interaction between several players and a somewhat all-powerful participant known as a Commanding Officer (CO).  Strike Force is not like more traditional games played on a board or with cards or some other tokens.  Instead, it is played with several players gathered around a table using various shaped dice and special sheets of paper to track important information.  The Commanding Officer sits at one end of the table and basically runs the game &ndash; providing maps and scene details for the players.  The other players are seated around the CO and interact with each other and with the CO.  The CO does most of the up-front work in the game by creating a story of his own choosing (you can think of it as a movie which the CO has created and which you are participating in) and unfolding this story for the players one scene at a time.  During game play, players will be faced with choices, dilemmas, opponents and anything else that the CO might conjure up.  Strike Force puts you (the player) in charge of every move, thought, whim and action of an imaginary character, which you will create and role-play throughout this &ldquo;movie&rdquo;.  This character can be very different from yourself (you are, after all, playing the role of someone fictional) and this character need not even be human.  There are four races from different planets from which to choose.  Each character will have certain abilities, which will help define them.  They will have be of a certain strength, have specific sight and quickness.  They will have a personality, toughness and intellect all derived from the game rules.  But above all, they will have you to control and act out their existence.  This is role-playing.<br/><br/>Many player actions are common and there needs to be some limits on what players can do.  With a role-playing game we use rules to determine the limits on various actions (especially physical or skill actions such as combat).  The rules tell us how far a player can jump, how far they can see and give us details and limits on various pieces of equipment and weapons.   We use dice to add a random element to the mix.  The dice can tell the CO if the player was successful in some action attempt (for example - jumping a bit further than is normally allowed) or has success in combat (does my long-range blaster shot hit my opponent?!?).<br/><br/>With Strike Force role-playing you will be able to explore the galaxy.  Not in a static way, but in an interactive way.  You will be able to ask questions about worlds you visit.  You can touch objects, hear sounds and feel sensations through your character.  You will gather facts, battle creatures and learn secrets all leading to an eventual goal.  You will be able to act out any action that your character is capable of.  You can make your character jump, run, search, taunt an opponent, fire a weapon, talk to an attendant at the local space port, bargain with an evil villain for your life and just about anything else that can be thought of.  Best of all, since the character is a fantasy character, the player can have them take risks and attempt the most fantastic of feats.  After all, it&rsquo;s only a game!<br/><br/>Strike force is typically played with several of these characters working together on a mission (this is the more technical term for the &ldquo;movie&rdquo; described above).  Missions are created by the Commanding Officer who guides players through the worlds and challenges that have been created.  Characters can be equipped with fancy futuristic weapons and other gadgets to help them succeed on these missions.   Characters will be paid by the Alliance of Planets &ndash; an organization that hires these characters to attempt these missions.  Pay will depend on the level of success by the mission party (the mission party is the collection of all characters assembled to play Strike Force for a particular mission).  These missions will range from a simple rescue of a hostage to assassination attempts.  There will be top-secret information to retrieve, technological data to steal and enemy plans to thwart.   The possibilities are endless.<br/><br/>During your play, your character will face villainous opponents, difficult situations and an incredible story line generated by your Commanding Officer.   Your character will encounter many other beings throughout their missions.  The CO will play the role of these beings (known as Non-Player Characters or NPCs), just as you play the role of your character.  You interact with these NPCs by interacting with the CO as he plays out their parts.<br/><br/>Strike Force stresses both the story line as well as character development.  As characters advance through missions, they will gain experience and learn new skills to help with future missions.  Pay will be accumulated to allow the character to purchase additional equipment.  Players will learn how to role-play and to extract the information they need from the story line that has been created for them.  This balance of character development and unfolding new story lines keeps the game interesting and fresh.<br/><br/>Role-playing games are not won or lost in the traditional sense.  It is for the sake of playing that someone plays a role-playing game.  To adventure with friends, to be an interactive part of a story as it unfolds and to contribute ideas to the success of the mission is the goal of playing.  The actual finishing of a mission is usually a small reward next to the actual movement through the story line.<br/><br/>Because this game is set in the not-to-distant future, there is a healthy mix of realism blended with science fiction.  There are many avenues open for exploration.  Lastly, remember that the universe is big.  Really big.  Infinitely, mind-blowing big.  So is the imagination behind Strike Force.  Enjoy the experience.<br/><br/>"}, "43762": {"rpgitemversion": {"191": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Technology of the Alliance", "usersrated": "0", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic568039.jpg", "rpgmechanic": {"2094": "Skill Based (buy or gain skills)"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"162": "Science Fiction (Space Opera)"}, "rpg": {"301": "Strike Force (9th Edition)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic568039_t.jpg", "description": "A book containing all things technological for the Strike Force RPG.

At that time, as his forces are completing the conquest of Poland, Hitler receives a flash of intuition. That is, he can&rsquo;t help but notice the strategic paralysis of the Anglo-French, who do nothing to try to prevent the downfall of their fast-disappearing eastern ally Poland. From that he concludes it would be a waste of time to redeploy the Wehrmacht to the western front in 1940. He tells his generals: &ldquo;The time will never be better to destroy the Bolshevik power than in the coming year. We will continue to have nothing to fear in the west. The British and French simply do not want war; they are afraid of it. Once we&rsquo;ve taken Moscow, we&rsquo;ll take Paris and London by telephone.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Accordingly, he also tells his foreign minister to drop all negotiations aimed at revising the original territorial split set out in the accords with the USSR the previous month. Most importantly, Lithuania, originally in the German &ldquo;sphere of interest,&rdquo; is not traded for a further slice of Polish territory.<br/><br/>All of which has resulted in this low-complexity, strategic-level, alternative history wargame. In it, two to four players can investigate the possibilities inherent in a changed German strategy for 1940. The West Front map is scaled at 16 miles per hexagon. The Eastern Front map is scaled at 25 miles per hex. All Soviet units are armies; all other forces in the game are corps. Each game turn on both maps equals half a month.<br/><br/>This game can be played by two, three or four. If two play, one commands the Germans, while the other commands both the Anglo-French and Soviets. If played by three, one player commands the Germans, one player commands the Anglo-French, and the third commands the Soviets. If four play, one player commands the Germans on the west map; the second commands the Germans on the east map; the third commands the Soviets, and the fourth commands the Anglo-French. The rules contain some 17,000 words, which means experienced players can finish it in about four hours.<br/><br/>Rules cover such things as: neutrals, fog of war, airpower, 7th Flieger Corps, Soviet 1st Shock Army, fortifications, and more.

The players usually take the roles of human explorers in the Young Kingdoms, although other race information is provided. The Elemental Gods (so frequently invoked by Elric) are described and a system for magic spells is also given. The game was revised and republished under the title Elric! some years later, however many people I know consider Stormbringer a better work. Like other Chaosium-produced games (Ringworld, Elfquest, Runequest, and Call of Cthulhu) skills are done on a d100 system and stats usually range from 2d6 to 3d6+6, depending on racial packages. Thus, if you know one game, it is pretty easy to pick up another. Of course, there are some minor differences from system to system, so it is not a truly universal RP system.

As your intrepid adventurers delve through the ruins, they will face deadly traps guarding the ancient relics they prize.<br/><br/>User Summary:<br/><br/>A very light dice-roller, basically a fun simulation of Indiana-Jones-style temple robbers. Players move through a Mayan temple, risking constant death while trying to get to the exit, carrying as much treasure as they dare. The more treasure cards you have, the fewer actions you might get this round. If your character gets killed, a second one can drop in and you may still get enough treasure and escape to win.<br/><br/>The temple starts with a room of crushing walls, leading into a winding passage that takes you past a lava pit and locked alcoves. The passage goes on, with two short-cuts that might save you time; a fast river or a rickety wooden bridge. You must balance attempts to grab treasure from the rooms, as you pass through, with staying ahead of a massive boulder, tumbling down the passage after you. If you have to let the boulder pass or be crushed to death, then you're forced to jump in the river and risk drowning just to get ahead. Otherwise, the boulder reaches the exit before you, blocking it and you're trapped forever.<br/><br/>A mix of very basic lucky dice-rolling, lucky card draw for the treasure, and some decision-making about possible risks. Beautifully produced, with 12 small but detailed plastics miniatures, and an exotic and deadly temple.

The game simply became known as BESM and was a modest hit at the show: I sold out of the 125 copies I brought with me. Soon, the buzz about this new anime game made its way around the industry, and I started to see some decent penetration into the gaming distribution market. &quot;Cool,&quot; thought I, &quot;This is fun.&quot;<br/><br/>Fast forward to the GAMA Trade Show in March 1998. Marcelo Figueroa of Shadis Magazine told me that BESM was nominated for the 1998 Origins Awards in the Best Role-Playing Game category. I was stunned, naturally, but I also became much more confident in the company's ability to survive at least for a little while. BESM didn't win, but that didn't matter. The industry took note of the little 96-page book with hardly any rules.<br/><br/>Fast forward again to December 1998. The Sailor Moon RPG and Resource Book was released with a red, triangular logo on the back cover that read, Tri-Stat System. The game mechanics had a name, and a fan-following soon developed. &quot;This is awesome,&quot; thought I, &quot;Much better than chemistry.&quot;<br/><br/>Now it's July 2000. Guardians of Order, Inc. is a 7-person company with both Canadian and US offices. The game that started it all has been revised and expanded. It may seem odd that this 288-page, 100,000-word book is actually a second edition of the first tiny one, but we are giving fans what they want.<br/><br/>Magic has been greatly revised and explained in detail, but the original version is still there. Options for mecha creation have been increased dramatically, but the original material remains. Character creation has been retooled and reorganized, but it is not really that different from what I first published three years ago. BESM second edition is not about making the game better than the first book; it's about giving players more options. In the two mammoth chapters on character creation, I think you'll agree that you now have all the options you could want.<br/><br/>The second edition of BESM is very special to me because it represents the origin of the company and how it has changed and grown over the past three years. At times, it is unsettling that David now knows more about Tri-Stat, the game that I created, than I do. I certainly wouldn't change this, however, since he has taken my original vision and transformed it into something much bigger. David has been the creative driving force behind Tri-Stat's progression, and I think that he has done a wonderful job. Tri-Stat is no longer my child alone; it belongs to the company.<br/><br/>Thank you all for supporting us over the years. Guardians of Order has received assistance from countless people, and the enthusiasm of our fans has driven us to be the best we can be. We hope that you enjoy Big Eyes, Small Mouth second edition, and continue enjoying it for many years to come.<br/><br/>Mark C. MacKinnon<br/>July 2000<br/><br/>Note concerning Revised Edition: This version of BESM is not substantially different than the standard second edition, but instead repackages the entire book in a more compact format. Some minor errors have been corrected, and a little material has been added, but the two books are identical at the core.<br/><br/>"}, "43871": {"boardgamedesigner": {"33723": {"name": "Greg Freuler"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "A Good Lie", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "13", "boardgamefamily": {"5652": "Sports: Golf"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic647158_t.jpg", "average": "5.85", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"13157": {"name": "Pro Active Sports Inc."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic647158.jpg", "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "A Good Lie combines the cunning and strategy of poker, the irreverence of liar's dice and the game of golf.<br/><br/>The object of A Good Lie is to create the lowest possible nine hole or eighteen hole score.

Players control one of three character types: magi, companions, or grogs.  Magi, also known as wizards, are the most powerful. Grogs are essentially common soldiers, while companions consist of scholars, healers, thieves, and military leaders.  Character abilities in the game fall into three categories: talents, skills, and knowledge.<br/><br/>Magi are able to learn five &quot;techniques&quot; (create, perceive, transform, destroy, control) and ten &quot;forms&quot; (animal, water, air, body, plant, fire, image, mind, earth, power). Magical combinations are then determined by cross referencing the various techniques and forms. Magical terms in the game use medieval Latin.<br/><br/>Much of the book is dedicated to the game's highly detailed magic system. Also included are weapon, armor, and ability charts, information on laboratories for non-adventuring magi, a complete bestiary with monster and animal statistics, four pages of character sheets, and a variety of other background materials.<br/><br/>"}, "43951": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic979883.png", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"24144": {"name": "Lothar Mulack"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1986", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"24144": "Lothar Mulack"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"384": {"name": "HABA - Habermaa\u00df GmbH"}}, "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic979883_t.png", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "description": "The children spin a wheel on the game board which shows the color of the square they can move to.

GW published the basic game with a uniquely British feel, two subsequent adventures as supplements, and supporting material in White Dwarf (the house magazine), a GM Screen and a range of GW figures, but eventually let the product lapse. Fan support sustained interest on the internet, and the original designer now publishes GH online as Squadron UK in PDF format.<br/><br/>Golden Heroes emphasises story-telling over dice rolling, a popular move in 80s RPG design. Character creation is random, with the player having to provide a satisfactory origin story to justify the super-powers rolled. Anything that doesn't fit is lost. Giving the players fewer or more power rolls creates ranges of power levels, from light one-power mutants to uberheroes.<br/><br/>In particular, combat is handled in Frames, giving a very strong comic book feel not found in comparable superhero games. After initiative, the character can spend some of their 4 Frames in combat, then the opponent spends their 4 Frames, then the character finishes off their Frames. You can pull Frames from the next round to dodge, which creates frantic combat but allows heroes to escape the odds against them. Mega-villains can be given 5 or 6 Frames, which balances a team of heroes very well.<br/><br/>The core game comes in the same box as all Games Workshop product of the 80s, with a 56pg softback Players Book and a 84pg softback Supervisors Book for the GM.

The dreamer feels at home while the sensible thinker is at loss.  Rules are unexistant in this new realm.  A host of emotions replace the laws of reason.  For a dream without emotions is but an empty shell, no matter how beautiful it is.  When we dream for ourselves, there is no need for harsh realism.  <br/>But to share a dream with others, to make an account of it, we have no choice but to relate only what is essential, despite ourselves.  <br/>A dream must not be understood or felt by another, it must be dreamt: the spectator must become the dreamer.&quot;<br/><br/>From the Inside Front Cover, Mechanical Side<br/><br/>Mechanical Aspect<br/><br/>&quot;Mechanisms are often perceived as cold and necessary elements.  Still, they exert fascination upon the curious mind.  The gears and working parts of reason struggle to understand their surroundings: the intellect awakens.  <br/>Mechanisms act as the bone structure of meaning.  In the absence of meaning, one must create it: a mechanism, in the pragmatic mind, is just a tool.  In the inquisitive mind, wonders occur as the mechanism comes to life, providing the spirit with great wellbeing.  <br/>How joyous to understand, to marvel before its working, how satisfying the find after such labor! Such gratification is only possible through mechanic: dreams are too permissive.<br/>The source of this mechanical poetry lies in the effort of its motion.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "43994": {"rpgitemversion": {"368": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Summerland", "rpgproducer": {"35035": "Phil Davies"}, "usersrated": "7", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3158709.jpg", "rpgmechanic": {"2112": "Dice (Primarily d6)"}, "average": "7.14286", "rpgissuearticle": {"32355": "Designer's Notes for Summerland"}, "rpggenre": {"2672": "Adult / Mature"}, "rpg": {"362": "Summerland"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3158709_t.jpg", "description": "&hellip;a subway station, dark except for stray shafts of light from our torches. Roots hang down from what remains of the ceiling, twisting down toward the ground as if groping for a hand hold in the darkness. You can see dirt and rubble scattered over a floor of broken tiles and litter. Your torch picks out a woman's handbag, rotting. An almost overpowering smell of earth, rich and loamy, fills the stagnant air. Scanning across the station to the tracks you spot two pin-points of light reflecting back at you - a wolf. It approaches, padding softly across the broken tiles of the floor, lips curled back from teeth in a frozen grin.<br/><br/>&hellip;a supermarket. Huge tree trunks thrust up from the ground, shattering the floor and tearing down the suspended ceiling the and structure beyond, allowing sunlight to penetrate. The aisle are choked with dirt and toppled goods, broken glass bottle half burried in the loamy dirt on the floor, their insides long since picked cleaned of any food. You recognise the frozen section, shattered glass and wrecked freezer doors revealing where the smell of meat once attracted visitors to plunder. There, ahead is the tinned goods aisle, your goal. Rounding the corner you confront a man sitting on the floor, clasping a tin in his hands. His clothes are dirty, ragged and torn. He is so filthy that soil seems to have penetrated his skin - his fingers are cracked and black as he mimics opening the can he holds with a broken stick. He turns to look at you with yellowed, feral eyes as you back away, turn and run back to the others. The noise of scattered tins tells you he's following...<br/><br/>&hellip;a road stretching away into the distance. Trees burst through the tarmac, forming a thick canopy of leaves overhead. The rusted remains of cars are dotted over the road, tossed aside as if by some gigantic hand. In one direction the road leads home, the other, to the neighboruring town. It is the safest way to get there. You wait, the others with you either by your side or hiding in the trees. Down the road another party of men come toward you, hands tightening on rifles. Inside you feel the gnaw of fear. If this summit meeting does not go well, it could spell the end of the struggle for you, your family and your friends. You can feel the tension rising, and the anger with it, as always. Who the hell are these guys, to threaten all you love. Just who the hell? Swallowing, you force down the bile, trying to keep a lid on the rage...<br/><br/>Welcome to Summerland, a role-playing game of desolation and redemption beneath the Sea of Leaves.<br/><br/>The time is now. The world has changed. The Event brought the Sea of Leaves into our world, an immense forest that choked cities and drowned civilisation overnight. From the trees came the Call, a lure to the weak that decimated the population. In the aftermath only pockets of humanity remain, resisting the woods' siren song. In the endless forests lurk the Lost - whose wills were drowned by the Call - and the Wild, who have forgotten they were ever human.<br/><br/>You are one of a select few who can resist the Call. A Drifter, hardened to the lure of the woods by the scars of the past, you cannot let go. Your torment shields you, but drives your isolation. More than anything you crave welcome in a community, but can never be truly accepted without leaving behind your past. To do that, you must confront and defeat the demons that haunt you.<br/><br/>What will you risk for redemption?
