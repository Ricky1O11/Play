In those times between these two countries there at peace, but there were a lot of border disputes which eventually caused a battle to be fought. Those are simulated in this game.<br/> The players should build armies in their castles, improve their current defenses and collect taxes from villages, while trying to work against the enemy opponent.<br/> Battles are one of the unique features that this game has. When you have a battle you take the &quot;battle&quot; map, and place your army there. On the strategic map you only have one counter, which shows only the name of the army, but you have to administrate, what kind of troops that army consists of (250 Hussars, 85 Infantry...etc). On the battle map you take the corresponding counters, and play battles with them, writing down casualties. Every unit has different fighting/moving values. The sieges are also great! Another map is used (there are about 6 different castles), and modified by the defenses you have built since the start of the game. It also has some extra rules, which make sieges fun. (for example when you go for a siege, you have to decide how much grain you will bring with you)<br/><br/>The good side of the game is that the Hungarian and the Turkish sides really differ from each other, and need completely different playing styles.<br/><br/>Of course, the game has a downside. The amount of administration needed to play might cause the casual player to never sit down and play a game.<br/><br/>This game is great in Hungarian history, and shows those times, which were so full with death, battles and instability.<br/><br/>"}, "27504": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Pete Blockley"], "poll": [], "name": "Schwerpunkt: Divisional Level WW2 Fast Play Rules 1920-1950", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Simulation"], "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic299356_t.jpg", "average": "4", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic299356.jpg", "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Miniatures", "Wargame", "World War II"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "Schwerpuckt is a set of miniature rules for playing large WW2 battles.

Rama is accompanied by his wife Sita and brother, Lakshmana. Vanavaas - the Adventures in the Forest follows their experiences until the kidnapping of Sita. In the second game, the Search for Sita, you follow the adventures of Rama and Lakshmana as they search for Sita and seek the help of the vanaras or monkeys. Hanuman finally finds Sita in Lanka where she is a prisoner of the demon king - Ravana. Rama and Lakshmana, along with their new friends Sugriva and Hanuman decide that the only option is to fight a war with Ravana and rescue Sita. It was a mighty battle fought between the rakshasas led by Ravana and the vanara army led by Rama. This game brings you face to face with some of the unforgettable characters like Kumbakarna, Indrajit and Jambavan. It also introduces you to many of the special powers that gave both sides the numerous advantages. Rama is invincible and represents the Power of Good. However, in the epic he is told to seek the assistance of the vanaras led by Sugriva. It is this that led to the concept of the game. The game is based on C. Rajagopalachari's Ramayana in English.

Each turn, the steamboats move a certain number of spaces up or down the river.<br/><br/>Age of Steam Expansion: Golden Spike: This Age of Steam expansion takes place in 1860&rsquo;s Western USA, where the Union Pacific Railroad and the Central Pacific Railroad raced towards each other in order to complete the first transcontinental railroad system with the Golden Spike. This is a 4-player team-dependent map, with players delivering goods to cities along the main route to build more track towards Promontory; if one side reaches before the other, their opponents are eliminated. The map starts with pre-printed &quot;hidden&quot; track tiles which are revealed each time a good is delivered to a city along the main Sacramento/Promontory/Omaha line. The game ends on the turn that at least one team reaches Promontory; if both teams reach it, victory points are tabulated as usual. If only one team reaches it, the other team's score is reduced to zero (but the winning team still determines each of their score using the traditional manner).<br/><br/>This expansion is professionally designed, printed and mounted on double-sided gameboard, just like the original Age of Steam map.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["Bezier Games Edition"], "average": "7.15234", "name": "Age of Steam Expansion: Mississippi Steamboats / Golden Spike", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Commodity Speculation", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Route/Network Building", "Tile Placement"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["Age of Steam", "Steam"], "usersrated": "120", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Age of Steam"]}, "27523": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Johann R\u00fcttinger", "Michael R\u00fcttinger"], "poll": [], "name": "Minz, Maunz und Bello", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1986", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Cats"], "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic177200_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Noris Spiele"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic177200.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "What's going on in the kitchen ?<br/><br/>The little kittens awake on the couch and are hungry.

Like its predecessors, Sport of Kings, Cockpit of Europe and Charlie's Year, it examines the War of the Austrian Succession at an operational level. Italy is the stage this time. Physically isolated from the titanic struggles in Germany and the Low Countries, Italy was anything but a backwater: successes and failures here had an important impact on the war as a whole. The war for Italy opened at the beginning of 1742. The Spanish Crown, after lengthy preparations, successfully invaded Italy by sea, bent on acquiring a duchy for the Queen's son, Don Felipe, and on reclaiming Spanish dominance in the region. Distracted by events elsewhere, the Habsburgs and their British allies were unable to prevent this move, but soon rebounded, drawing as a reluctant partner the pre-eminent local power, Piedmont-Sardinia, and its Frederician-like ruler, Charles Emmanuel of the House of Savoy.<br/><br/>QG can accommodate up to four players, though it is easily played with two, and can even be played solitaire. The four sides are Bourbon France, Bourbon Spain, the Habsburg Empire, and Savoy (Piedmont-Sardinia). Also available are the forces of Genoa, Modena, Venice, Naples, and some pesky Royal Marines. Other territories, like the Papal States, wield influence rather than the sword.<br/><br/>A game on the War of Austrian Succession in Italy.

Stratagame is as much about skillful diplomacy as is it about chess-like strategic know-how. The player who in the end owns most of the continent&rsquo;s resources wins this game of epic adventure.<br/><br/>Stratagame is a strategy game in which 2 to 6 players try to capture the continent&rsquo;s resources. Stratagame is played on a chessboard roughly representing Europe. There are no countries or clearly defined territories in Stratagame. Stratagame has no preset historic framework and no realistic pretensions, therefore Stratagame is not a wargame or a simulation game. Stratagame combines the mechanics of games like chess with modern strategy principles. Compared to other games in its category , Stratagame has been designed to be simple and easily understood. There are no overly complex or difficult rules in Stratagame and the manual has only 6 pages of rules. However, as like chess, the simplicity of the rules does not guarantee an easy mastery of the game. Stratagame is generally played in 2 to 4 hours, depending on the number of players and strategies involved.<br/><br/>Stratagame contains 6 armies of different colors each composed of 52 playing pieces. As like chess, when a playing piece tries to enter a square already occupied by an enemy piece, a combat occurs. Each playing piece has a Strength of 1 to 5. A playing piece&rsquo;s Strength determines the number of dice it rolls during combat. The piece obtaining the highest result on the dice wins the combat. As per other chess-like games, Stratagame can also be played without dice.<br/><br/>Contains:<br/><br/>1 chessboard (21&rdquo; x 33&rdquo;)<br/>1 rulebook<br/>6 reference sheets<br/>60 playing cards<br/>24 resource tokens<br/>12 dice<br/><br/>6x 21 infantries<br/>6x 11 bases<br/>6x 3 artilleries<br/>6x 6 mechanized<br/>6x 4 armors<br/>6x 5 fleets<br/>6x 1 heavy armor<br/>6x 1 QG<br/><br/>"}, "27583": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic202839.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Battle: The Game of Generals"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["S.

You must cut each card apart along the dotted line, then collate by team.<br/><br/>Each Classic baseball team contains 25 players, 15 fielders and 10 pitchers, and 2 pitcher at-bat cards that are standard for all teams; including American League teams - the cards being used when involved in either World Series or inter-league play, if you so desire.<br/><br/>"}, "27620": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Kirby Lee Davis"], "poll": [], "name": "Gauntlet", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "1985", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "16", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic181666_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["The Games of Fashan"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic181666.jpg", "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Exploration", "Fantasy", "Maze"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Summary of Rules (from Instructions)<br/><br/>Gauntlet is a role-playing board game in which players (often referred to in their game role as Travelers) battle their way through a maze of hazardous tunnels and monsters.<br/><br/>Gauntlet may be played in four different versions: the Race Game, the Treasure Game, the Hunter Game, or the Tournament Game.

Players have 14 characters to choose from all based on role playing archetypes, such as heroes, wizards, villains, thieves, monsters, etc.  The game makes players feel they are traveling the world to find equipment, weapons, ancient relics, and companions that will help them on their quest to acquire the Crown of Command.  Along the way they visit various locales in the worlds, battle each other and fantastic creatures to make their way to the top.<br/><br/>Goal:<br/><br/>Each player is trying to move from the outer world and ultimately to the inner world. Players wander the outer, middle, and inner worlds trying to acquire equipment, weapons, and companions.  They will also improve statistics with equipment, companions, and encounters and battles with fantasy creatures and each other.  Once they complete a Talisman quest, players will enter the inner world and face its challenges to finally reach the Portal of Power to claim the Crown of Command.  Then the other players must race to stop this player before he eventually kills them all with the Command spell.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>To begin, players select a character card from among the 14 provided.  Characters have basic statistics to start.  These are Life [hit points], Strength [physical prowess], and Craft [Magic and Intelligence].  Some characters are naturally more gifted in combat and others in magic, while others are mix of the two.  Additionally characters are often differentiated with unique abilities, starting equipment, and starting spells.  This all makes the players actually feel different during play.  In addition items and companions players acquire during play also add to statistics, increasing Strength, Craft, Life or adding new abilities, etc.<br/><br/>Actual game play is relatively simple, making the game easy to pick up with novices.  On a player's turn they throw a die for movement.  Player then chooses which direction, left or right, or if meeting qualifications may be able to move from outer to middle world, or middle to inner world.  Once on space, player follows instructions on space, or encounters face up cards already in space, or other player if in space.  Most spaces have a player draw a number of cards to encounter.  These can be creatures, companions, weapons, equipment, treasure, or relics.  Players must fight creatures and win before acquiring any other items or companions.  If another player is in the space, players may attack with either Craft or Strength but are not required to do so.  The defender defends with same statistic attacked with.  If the defender loses, he loses a life and an item or companion of attackers choice.  If the attacker loses, he loses a life.<br/><br/>Players start in the outer world, and build up their character's statistics and items to try and move to the middle world.  There are two ways to move up to the middle world, one requiring a test of strength and the other a boat man's ride for a price.  Once in the middle world, play proceeds in the same manner, but the challenge generally is increased with more threats such as the desert and temple.  However, there is more potential for encounters and items as most spaces now draw more than one card.<br/><br/>In the middle world, players may also acquire a Talisman quest, that once completed, will grant them a Talisman.  The Talisman is required to unlock the Crown of Command and pass through the Portal of Power in the Inner World.<br/><br/>Once players have a Talisman and have enough Strength or Craft to enter the Portal of Power, they will try to enter the Inner World.  There they must face and survive the guardians there, like the Vampire's Tower and Werewolf before claiming the Crown of Command.  Once a player claims the Crown of Command, they can cast the Command Spell, automatically forcing a player to lose a life.  It then becomes a race for the Crown as the other players try to take the player with the Crown down before he finishes them all off.<br/><br/>Revised using:<br/><br/>    Talisman Upgrade Pack<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Black Industries Edition", "Chinese Edition", "Fantasy Flight Games Revised 4th Edition", "French edition", "German edition", "Giochi Uniti Italian edition", "Hebrew edition", "Nexus Italian edition", "Polish Edition", "Portuguese Edition", "Russian Edition", "Spanish Edition"], "average": "6.57627", "videogamebg": ["Talisman: Digital Edition"], "name": "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition)", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Role Playing", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": ["Talisman (4th Edition): Arena", "Talisman (4th Edition): Optional Characters", "Talisman (4th Edition): Rod of Ruin", "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): Crown of Command", "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): Danse Macabre", "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): Doppelganger", "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): Instructor", "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): Mephisto #48 Promo Characters", "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Blood Moon Expansion", "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Cataclysm Expansion", "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The City Expansion", "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Deep Realms Expansion", "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Dragon Expansion", "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Dungeon Expansion", "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Firelands Expansion", "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Frostmarch Expansion", "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Harbinger Expansion", "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Highland Expansion", "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Nether Realm Expansion", "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Reaper Expansion", "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Sacred Pool Expansion", "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Woodland Expansion"], "usersrated": "9346", "boardgameaccessory": ["Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): e-Raptor organizer", "Talisman Upgrade Pack"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Talisman"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["+1 Downtime, December 2012: Games I don't want for Christmas", "Episode 4: Making Prototypes", "Episodio 11 \u2013 Especial verano 2013: Juegos no jugados", "I've Been Diced! episode 13: Guilty pleasure board games", "OBG 87: Building Tournaments", "The Dice Section 25: Wrath of Ashardalon and the Perfect Dungeon Crawl", "The Fifth SU&amp;SD Podcast, From SU&amp;SD", "The Spiel #68 - That's A Wrap - 2008 Holiday Gift Guide", "Vox Republica 134: Teeny Santorini"]}, "27628": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Fred Horn"], "poll": [], "name": "Agilidade", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Building", "Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic179787_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Origem"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic179787.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Agilidade ... a 3-in-row game.<br/><br/>Material: glass game board, black and white wood playing pieces - 7 per player.<br/><br/>White starts and, in turn, pieces are placed on any one of 5 spaces, including on other pieces.<br/>The object is to get 3 same-color pieces in a row - horizontally, vertically or diagonally.<br/><br/>"}, "27630": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Tyler Kenney"], "poll": [], "name": "Robots", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic192762_t.jpg", "average": "4.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Mattel"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic192762.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Mattel Edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Dice", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Based on the animated film, players are robots moving around Robot City (the board) collecting spare parts tokens.

Some of the players are werewolves, many are plain, simple villagers, but many players have special abilities, such as being able to tell who is a werewolf and who isn't, and the Magician, who can save or kill any other player instantly. Each night the werewolves eat a villager. Each day, the village convenes and attempts to lynch one of their own, trying to find the werewolves that are secretly living among them.<br/><br/>The Ultimate Werewolf: Whitebox Edition package from Bezier Games makes this game easier to play than ever before, and supports up to 31 players! Ultimate Werewolf: Whitebox Edition includes a number of components to make your games faster, more intriguing, and more fun than ever before:<br/><br/>31 Sleeved Player Cards: These lavishly illustrated full-color cards contain the name of the role and a short description of that role's abilities. There's no confusion as to what each card is and what that role does. Each player card comes in a plastic sleeve with a sliding insert that covers the card face. There's no chance of accidentally flipped, dropped, or otherwise revealed cards.<br/><br/>Getting Started with Ultimate Werewolf Guide: This handy guide provides information and advice about everything related to setting up and moderating an Ultimate Werewolf game, from how to set up the chairs for the players to how to keep the game moving along.<br/><br/>Player Reference Cards: 30 full-size reference cards with a complete role listing and explanation on one side, and a detailed walk-through of the gameplay on the other.<br/><br/>Moderator Reference Cards: Reference cards for the Moderator with a detailed walk-through (including what to say at each step of the game) on one side, and role identity charts to fill out during the first night - never get confused over who is the hunter or any other role!<br/><br/>Role Suggestion Card: A handy reference card that suggests the right mix of werewolves, villagers, and special roles for players in any number from 7-31.<br/><br/>Name Card Tents: Included are 30 name card tents so all players can address each other by name; great for large groups, visitors, and team-building events.<br/><br/>The Amulet of Protection: One player secretly has an Amulet of Protection that will prevent him from dying one time. At night he may pass the Amulet to another player. Any role may have the Amulet, which is a smaller card that is inserted between the role card and the sliding insert.<br/><br/>Custom Cards: If you're an experienced player who likes to play with a certain role not included in the base set, you can select an additional role from a list, or even have custom cards made and enclosed with your order.<br/><br/>Unique custom roles found only in Ultimate Werewolf: Whitebox Edition: The Village Idiot, Wolf Cub, Aura Seer and Spellcaster.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Werewolf<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Ultimate Werewolf: Ultimate Edition<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "7", "boardgameversion": ["B\u00e9zier Games Edition"], "average": "6.26761", "name": "Ultimate Werewolf: Whitebox Edition", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Partnerships", "Role Playing", "Variable Player Powers", "Voting"], "age": "14", "usersrated": "71", "boardgameaccessory": ["Ultimate Werewolf: ArtPack", "Ultimate Werewolf: Character Meeples"], "boardgamefamily": ["Werewolf / Mafia"]}, "27683": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic185979.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Caf\u00e9 International"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Rudi Hoffmann", "Roland Siegers"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2007", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgamepublisher": ["AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic185979_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Children's Game"], "description": "(from publisher's website) Welcome to the international caf&eacute; that's just for kids.

Each player starts with 4 egg-cups, in one of two colors, on the base row of the grid, with a ball on the two corner ones. The aim is to be the first player to move these cups to the baseline of the opponent and get the 2 balls again onto the 2 egg-cups on the edges. If the starting player does this first, then the opponent has the chance to get a draw if they manage to do the same thing in the turn immediately afterwards.<br/><br/>Each turn a player picks one of two moves. A player can either move one cup with a ball to a free space that touches it, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Or a player can move the ball from one of their pieces to another one of their pieces that touches it in those same directions. When a blockade occurs, by 2 rows that block each other on the center rows, the active player may jump with a piece that contains a ball over an opponent's piece. When one player still has a piece on the start line, and the opponent has filled all other end-spaces, that piece needs to vacate its space right away.

The Election of 1960 is the story of two men, John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon. One is the scion of a wealthy, politically powerful family from New England. The other is the son of a Quaker grocer in Whittier, California. While they belong to opposing political parties, they start out as friends. The complex development of that friendship, however, would shape a pivotal presidential election and cast a long shadow over American history for the remainder of the 20th century.<br/><br/>&quot;In 1960: The Making of the President, you take on the role of one of these great protagonists vying for the right to lead his country into the heart of the Cold War. However, it is not just foreign policy that poses a challenge to American leadership; this is also an era of great social turmoil and progress. As the United States continues to build upon the promise of its founding, candidates must contend with the question of civil rights and balance their positions on social justice against the need for valuable Southern electoral votes. Of course, the ever-present issue of the economy also rears its ugly head, and both Nixon and Kennedy will compete to be the candidate with the voters' pocket books in mind.<br/><br/>&quot;The contest is fought out on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960&mdash;a map where Louisiana and Florida share the same number of electoral votes, as do California and Pennsylvania. Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon&rsquo;s lazy shave, President Eisenhower&rsquo;s late endorsement, and the 'Catholic question' are all included as specific event cards. The famous televised debates and final election day push are each handled with their own subsystems. Candidates vie to capture each state&rsquo;s electoral votes using campaign points in the four different regions of the country. At the same time, they must build momentum by dominating the issues of the day and attempt to gain control of the airwaves.<br/><br/>&quot;As with any election campaign, the challenge is to adapt your game plan as the ground shifts out from under you. There are never enough resources or time to do everything, but you need to make the tough calls to propel yourself into the White House. This fast-playing strategy game for two players challenges you to run for the most powerful elective office in the world, at one of its most unique crossroads. Will you recreate history, or rewrite it? 1960: The Making of the President provides you the opportunity to do both.&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Filosofia French edition", "Gabinete L\u00fadico Spanish edition", "GMT English first edition", "Z-Man English first edition", "Z-Man English second edition"], "average": "7.56417", "name": "1960: The Making of the President", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Hand Management"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "6930", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: USA", "Political: Elections"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 24: One Year Anniversary - Jamie Keagy of The Secret Cabal", "Episode 39 - Our Most Anticipated Games in 2017", "I've Been Diced! episode 3: Games that stood the test of time", "I've Been Diced! episode 40: Jason Matthews", "Ludology Episode 50 - 50 for 50, Part 1", "OBG 017: The Big Event", "RJ51: Jocs de taula i pol\u00edtica amb Jason Matthews", "The Game Pit Episode 18 - Picking Over the Bones", "The Messy Game Room Episode 3", "The Messy Game Room Episode 7", "The Spiel #66 - Hail to the Chief", "The Spiel #68 - That's A Wrap - 2008 Holiday Gift Guide"]}, "27709": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Pennant", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Simulation"], "yearpublished": "1977", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Baseball"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic180955_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Destiny"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic180955.jpg", "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Sports"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "The tag line for the game is &quot;Play an entire season in just a couple of hours&quot;.

Trapper is suited especially well for two players.<br/><br/>Players are trappers in the Canadian wilderness, catching wild animals in the forests and lakes and searching for fungus and herbs. You ship your prey in canoes. As soon as one of your canoes is full, you sell the goods at the market. Both in the gathering of your prey and in the filling of your canoes, you need clever plans and foresight. Who will make the most valuable captures? The winner is the player who possesses the most money.<br/><br/>The game offers two different versions: A basic version in which luck plays a larger share and a somewhat more demanding version for tactically-minded players.<br/><br/>The basic game of Trapper is a simple game in the style of Verflixxt and Celtica that's suitable for a wide target audience. Good luck and tactics are about equal on the scales.<br/><br/>The somewhat more demanding version offers more tactical possibilities. How should one advance with the animal gathering? Which is more lucrative, getting a few larger and very valuable canoes or bringing many small canoes with different species to the market? Both strategies can lead to success.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Clementoni German First edition 2007"], "name": "Trapper", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Set Collection"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "185", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "average": "6.11459"}, "27720": {"boardgamedesigner": ["J.

The game is quick (3-6 hours) and clean (map using area movement). Hearts and Minds uses most major events of the period, including proposed events such as the Macnamara Line which was never actually built. Although nominally a combat game, the mechanisms actually revolve around both sides occupying South Vietnamese provinces for propaganda purposes. The heart of the game is political influence. There is little doubt that the Allied player will eventually withdraw his American boys from the quagmire, but the question is, how quickly and in what numbers?<br/><br/>Hearts and Minds contains 80 cards, tokens to represent the American army, the ARVN army, the NVA army, VC units of varying hidden strength, the Cambodian army, the Laotian army and a small contingent of international allies. Turn tokens, withdrawal tokens, reduced movement tokens as well CAS (Close Air Support), communist Air Suppression and artillery are also included. More rules cover Air Cavalry, naval support, Riverine interdiction, and bombers. Untried troops are a liability in the game; Veteran troops are a necessity. Ultimately, the Communist player must deal the American such a crushing public relations disaster that he will abandon his Southeast Asian allies before the momentum of those allies stalemates the irreversible infiltration of South Vietnam.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition", "Second edition"], "average": "7.59389", "name": "Hearts and Minds: Vietnam 1965-1975", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Dice Rolling", "Simulation"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "321", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Cambodia", "Country: Vietnam", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["I've Been Diced! episode 43: A Descent into frustration, and a belated best/worst of 2012 list"]}, "27740": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Canadian Football Game", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move", "Simulation"], "yearpublished": "1964", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic182071_t.jpg", "average": "4.83333", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Somerville Ltd."], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic182071.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Sports"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "With the aid of 3 spinners the team on offense tries to move the football down field for a touchdown.<br/><br/>Spinner A represents passing play attempts, Spinner B running attempts and Spinner C, kicks, field goals or conversion attempts.<br/><br/>NOTE: Unlike American football, Canadian football only allows 3 downs to make 10 yards.<br/><br/>"}, "27741": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Rail Masters Trust Company", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pick-up and Deliver", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1985", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic182038_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Randall Book Co."], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic182038.jpg", "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Trains", "Trivia"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>&quot;Venture into America's romantic past.

The first Railroad to deliver all five spikes wins.<br/><br/>Who will be the next RAIL MASTER?&quot;<br/><br/>The Rail Masters Trust Company is a Trivial Pursuit inspired train trivia game with added economic and pick up and deliver mechanics. Players take the role of one of six holding companies from 1862 and start with $100,000 granted by the government. Starting from the roundhouse, players roll and move around the board answering train trivia questions to get extra moves. There are six spike squares of five different colors the players are aiming to land on where they can purchase a spike from the government. The train playing pieces have slots to hold two spikes maximum, so spikes must be delivered to the roundhouse before more can be picked up. On Rail Crossing spaces, &quot;community chest&quot; type cards are drawn that decrease or increase a player's money. Players can sell their spikes to any other player at any time for any price.<br/><br/>The trivia questions are all multiple choice or true and false, so you don't need to be a train trivia expert to be competitive.

This plays very similarly to the flood mechanic in the Atlantis scenario from the Atlantis and Das Buch scenario packs.<br/>     Traders &amp; Barbarians - New in this edition. - You get new hexes, one for the castle, one to produce glass, and one to produce marble. You try to rebuild Catan after the invasion. You get gold and victory points if you finish tasks in the castle, but to do so you have to travel back and forth to the castle on roads and undeveloped paths.

Pirate warehouses are equivalent to settlements in Catan, and the player receive resources from these warehouses whenever a die roll matches the number showing on that island. These resources take the form of equipment cards, and the resources are wood, wool, rum, sabers and gold. With these, players construct ships and more pirate warehouses or buy development cards. Instead of a robber, players must now beware of a Ghost Pirate, which can block the resources normally provided by a warehouse.<br/><br/>Each player starts with two pirate warehouses, and the first player to build seven warehouses wins. In order to build a new warehouse, however, a player must go by ship from an existing warehouse to a new construction site, which thus keeps players alternating between constructing ships and warehouses.<br/><br/>Aside from the change in theme, other changes between The Settlers of Catan and Catan: Junior include the elimination of cities (i.e., warehouses can't be upgraded) and the distance rule between settlements, resources allocated by the roll of one die instead of a pair of D6s, and the introduction of a marketplace that allows trading with the bank. At the start of the game, one equipment card of each type is placed in the marketplace; on a player's turn, he can exchange one card in hand for a card in the marketplace.

BSO Games, however, has added to this simplicity a combat system that rates units for how many dice they get to roll on their behalf, as well as what kind of dice (small arms or Heavy Weapons). No CRTs, no siree!<br/><br/>The game also uses cards, one deck (of 10) for each player (whose cards are somewhat different from those of the other player) to enhance the game. (They don't &quot;drive&quot; the game and they can be left out, if you&rsquo;re so inclined.) The cards are part of a Resource system that gives the players a number of points which they can use to buy cards, rally units or bring in Reinforcements.

You can bribe the different people in the game to attack your opponents and take their items from them. You may battle opponents when you land on the same square as them deciding which items to use in each different situation. You may warp to different areas of the board using the tunnel either to attack an opponent or strategically move into a position which is more beneficial.

It belonged to a childhood friend--a gift from the designer, if I recall correctly--and I've never seen it in a store.<br/><br/>To the best of my recollection, there were similarities to roll 'n' move games such as PayDay or Life:  The board was a simple figure-eight track around which the playing pieces would move, and each space had some sort of action or consequence for the player; there were also free spaces that required no activity.  In addition, there were stock certificates that could be purchased and/or traded as well as cards to be drawn at certain points; the cards also had ramifications for the player, similar to the Chance/Community Chest cards in Monopoly.<br/><br/>I'm afraid I don't recall the specific mechanics--obviously the notion of inflation was part of the game--but the essential goal was to remain solvent and earn more money than your opponent(s).  My recollection is that the game ended when a certain period of time had passed, most likely defined by a set number of laps around the board.  I enjoyed the game quite a bit when I was a kid:  It seemed more sophisticated and complex than its roll 'n' move cousins, and I recall there being a number of potential activities to be undertaken with each turn.<br/><br/>I would love to hear from anyone else who has played this rare gem.  It was published by a company called Zany Eights Productions, Inc., in Pottstown, PA; I suspect that the first-and-only print run was very limited, and Zany Eights never published any other games, as far as I know.<br/><br/>edit:<br/>From the Rules:<br/>The object of the game is to be the last remaining played on the board who has survived week after week of spiraling inflation.  As inflation becomes worse and the cost of living increases, each player must meet his daily expenses, while making sure his salary keeps pace with current prices. Most Importantly, each player must keep his job in order to avoid certain financial disaster. Although provisions have been made for only six players, any number may participate.

Alongside the Crystal Elves, progenitors of the Ferach, are the Krautan Dwarves members of a League encompassing hundreds of small baronies and thiefdoms.  The Krautans are next in strength to the Crystal Empire and more powerful than the Cities of Man that have appeared across the central continent.   Other organized states try to hang onto the vestiges of a disappearing civilization but it has not been easy for the Undead led by the sinister Necromancers and the Dragon Children or Dracci have rampaged across Valon embroiled in their own huge war that decimates all who fall in its path.<br/><br/>From the frozen north the shambling Undead have crumbled many societies and created free booters and mercenaries who sell their swords to the highest bidders, among them the Gnome Legion and the Dogmen of Stasia.  It is in Alevia a former province of the Crystal Empire that the mighty Elf regiments make their stand against the Undead and the Dracci.  It is from the vast sea in the south beyond Ibe-Herra that the Dragons came bringing carnage to the Goblin Principalities behind their wooden walls and forming an alliance of convenience with the fawning Lizardmen.  Savage Orc tribes migrate across all these battle torn lands bringing more pain, though as always their enemies loose flights of barbed arrows upon their approach.<br/><br/>Choose your side carefully in the Maelstrome for though you may admire the remorseless Necromancers or the fury of the Dracci the other races have much to offer.  March with the Imperial Elf Regiments or the Regiments of the Wood Elves not forgetting the armies of Man or the Orc Tribes.  All can hire warriors from a common pool of fighters, entire units of Ogres, Mountain Orcs even Gnomes who kill with hundred tiny blades.  Do not forget of course that your army must have a powerful Mage to wield Wylde Magick in a nimbus of power to pour on your foes each race sports different lethal incantations.  Also you can use a Beast Handler to control huge savage monsters that are the doom of a multitude of soldiers, War Trolls and Corpse Monsters assembled from piles of the recently dead.<br/><br/>Once this army of yours is assembled and stands ready uniforms bright or armour rusted and well used you must select a Warlord and special leaders to drive your units forward.

Its main purpose is to recreate the Tour de France in its entirety over 14 stage sessions, with each player in charge of a team of 8 riders with individual abilities.<br/><br/>But what you get, in essence, is a highly flexible modular stage construction kit that allows you to create a wide range of possible races for 6 teams of 8 riders each, using 136 plain-colored terrain tiles in 5 colors. And although its scope is for an entire Tour, it is equally feasible to play only a single stage, recreate other tours and existing one-day classics, or embark on a completely made-up race. Saying that, a lot of the dynamics only come into play when team managers aren't only trying to snatch the stage victory from their competitors, but need to keep an eye on the overall rankings for each individual rider as well, as the end goal is to carry the Yellow Jersey to Paris. More so, and just like in the real Tour, the Sprint and Mountain Tricots are also up for grabs, so during each race it is important to get your key riders in point-scoring positions at the right time.<br/><br/>This dice-driven racing simulation includes rules for terrain handling, breakaways, tempo raising, slipstreaming, pack-splitting, sprints, fatigue, doping-use, overtaking, falls, team-cooperation and other events, but squeezes all this in a simple system that does not bogs down in details or oodles of bookkeeping.<br/><br/>By stripping the inner workings of a cycling race down to core mechanics that are based around only 4 different types of terrain tile (flat, uphill, downhill, and - to settle communal arrivals - sprints), the game instead concentrates on the different abilities of each rider to use certain types of terrain to his advantage. These abilities, again, are stripped down to their core. Team sheets show 8 unique riders, each with 4 to 8 special action points in specific terrain colours, that get covered when used. Remarkably, this is enough creates a race dynamic that is genuinely similar to the real deal. Servants will be used to get the specialists in position, or bridge gaps to escaped groups or soloists. The stronger riders will use their abilities to snatch points on their favourite type of terrain, and the team champions will be protected by their team members for most of the race, but ultimately need to rely on their superior movement bonuses to battle it out amongst each other. Often, the mountain stages are key arenas that shape the face of the remaining Tour, when riders no longer can rely on group efforts, and have to face the long uphill climb on individual strength alone. Each stage, team leaders will need to balance the need for interteam co-operation against their individual team's chances to gain an advantage. Sounds familiar?<br/><br/>During the race, the starting pack will slowly split up in individual packs, smaller groups (2-7 riders) and soloists, all standing on their own terrain tiles in small stacks of numbered plastic pieces in the 6 team colors (for larger packs replacement markers are used). In a standard turn, the top cyclist on each tile-stack will throw the D20, and move 1 forwards on an odd roll, and 2 tiles on an even, taking the entire underlying stack along through slipstreaming. That cyclist will then have spent his energy and move to the bottom of the stack, handing over the front position to the next one in line. From the head of the race down, each tile with riders will be dealt with in turn, and that process repeats itself until all riders have completed the stage, or are disqualified for arriving too late, with a bigger time-gap to the leader than allowed.<br/><br/>Each standard (group) move can be modified by one special move if managers so desire, and if they have the rider(s) that can pull it off on that type of terrain. This special move can either be a breakaway attempt, a general raising of the tempo, a deliberately go-slow decision by the speed-setting rider, or a tactical manoeuvre that can cause a pack to split. Each time a rider uses a speciality point, it is marked off from his entry on the team sheet. When the last ability point has been covered up, that rider is too tired to pull off any further special moves. A rider that has spent all his bonus points will start the next stage fatigued, whereas a rider that has spared himself will enter the next stage with a bonus point, just like the new holder of the Yellow Jersey. When the race leader changes terrain type, a random event is triggered that can befall any rider in the race.<br/><br/>When more than 1 rider arrives at a sprint banner, the top of a mountain, or the finish line, a sprint is triggered to settle the differences. Riders who can draw on team support, or are natural sprinters can use this to start the sprint in advantageous positions.<br/><br/>This is a great game for fans of the cycling genre, but might be a tad repetitive for others, especially when a lot of team managers join the race and when the starting pack splits up in many different groups. It then takes quite a few die rolls before the 50 to 90 tile route has been conquered by all. As a sport simulation, it works best when a full field of riders is present, and when an entire tour is played out over multiple sessions. If you play individual stages only, the race dynamics are far less colourful since the team managers only need to focus on getting one rider through the finish line, rather than juggle positions, general fitness, and overall rankings of their entire team of riders.<br/><br/>Included with the set are the assembly instructions for the 14 stages, and team sheets for each team manager, detailing the individual abilities of 8 unique (real-life) riders from the 1995 tour. It isn't clear if the brothers intended to supply updated packs for subsequent tours and races, but enthusiasts have.<br/><br/>PUBLICATION HISTORY:<br/><br/>     1995 Maillot Jaune Inauen Spiele - handmade limited edition - out of print<br/>     1996 Le Tour Inauen Spiele - handmade re-issue - out of print<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Maillot Jaune was Patrick's debut game, and was launched at the Schweizer Spielmesse in 1995, where it sold all of 13 stickered white cardboard boxes.

Players have to manage their armies using an abstract logistical system called &ldquo;Transport Points&rdquo; in the game. The Japanese Transport Points are an abstraction of the merchant marine force that the Japanese had available in 1904 and 1905. This can be disrupted from Russian naval activity. The Russian Transport Points are an abstraction of the rail capacity of the newly built Trans-Siberian Railroad. Weather can affect this total if there are heavy snows in Siberia. Colonel Akashi can also stir up trouble and reduce the available Russian Transport totals with sudden strikes and riots in the Russian heartland. Both players use these points to bring on new forces and to replace battlefield losses. Finding the right balance of the two uses is key to being successful in the game.<br/><br/>Secondly, players must find the delicate balance between defending and attacking on two separate fronts. How much defends and attacks towards the all-important port of Port Arthur and how much attacks or holds the tough mountain passes of Manchuria - the key to the open plains to the north &ndash; where terrain is less defensible and victory points are everywhere.<br/><br/>Victory in the game is determined by success in the naval war, the capture of key terrain objectives and enemy losses.<br/><br/>Game components:<br/><br/>* One 22&rdquo; by 39&rdquo; full color map<br/>    * 140 1/2&rdquo; land formation counters<br/>    * 44 1 1/4&rdquo; by 5/8&rdquo; ship counters<br/>    * 16 page full color rulebook<br/><br/>Game summary:<br/><br/>* Playtime: 3-5 hours<br/>    * Complexity: Simple<br/>    * Solitaire rating: excellent<br/><br/>Game scale:<br/><br/>* Turns: 12 (each turn represents one month of real time)<br/>    * Counters: Divisions and Brigades for the land units, Capital Ships for the naval units<br/>    * Hex scale: 10 kilometers<br/><br/>Game Credits:<br/><br/>* Designer: Yukihiro Kuroda<br/>    * Developer: Adam Starkweather<br/>    * Graphic Artist: Niko Eskubi<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Multi-Man Publishing first print edition"], "average": "7.17473", "name": "The Tide at Sunrise: The Russo-Japanese War, 1904-1905", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "184", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Japan", "International Games Series", "Solitaire Games", "Solitaire Wargames"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The Messy Game Room Episode 36"]}, "27966": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Chips are Down", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1970", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["3D Games"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic185020_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ideal"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic185020.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Ideal Edition 1970"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This is a guessing game from Ideal.

One player plays the Germans and their allies (the Axis) and the other plays the Soviets. While paper and cardboard cannot possibly simulate a large-scale war, this game does attempt to model some of the significant aspects of the conflict, and also give the players an idea of the problems their historical counterparts faced.<br/><br/>Masahiro Yamazaki has long been considered the East Front specialist in Japan. His games - including the excellent Stalingrad Pocket by the Gamers - have been enjoyed by English gamers since 1992. Now, for the first time, MMP is very proud to present his ultimate vision of the War in Russia. With over 10 years of development and expertise, Masahiro has culled all of his talents to give you the finest game on the entire Eastern Front of World War Two.<br/><br/>Red Star Rising is part of the International Games Series (IGS) from Multi-Man Publishing (MMP). Using a variant of the popular Victory in the West chit pull system, but with some very novel twists, Masahiro presents the theater as never before. If the Soviet player can weather the Nazi storm, she will rise from the ashes and become the powerful enemy that defeated Germany.

Moving down more levels than your height when moving from one hex to another counts as falling and you might take damage - unless you are falling into water.<br/><br/>Combat in the game is fairly straightforward. You roll attack dice as listed on your unit's card under attack, and the opponent rolls defense dice equal to the defense number on their unit's card. Skulls rolled in excess of shields count as wounds.
