Unfortunately it is only Hungarian language, but easily translated into English.<br/> The game map represents about 100x100 km territory near Lake Balaton, and shows little villages, towns and cities. In those times between these two countries there at peace, but there were a lot of border disputes which eventually caused a battle to be fought. Those are simulated in this game.<br/> The players should build armies in their castles, improve their current defenses and collect taxes from villages, while trying to work against the enemy opponent.<br/> Battles are one of the unique features that this game has. When you have a battle you take the &quot;battle&quot; map, and place your army there. On the strategic map you only have one counter, which shows only the name of the army, but you have to administrate, what kind of troops that army consists of (250 Hussars, 85 Infantry...etc). On the battle map you take the corresponding counters, and play battles with them, writing down casualties. Every unit has different fighting/moving values. The sieges are also great! Another map is used (there are about 6 different castles), and modified by the defenses you have built since the start of the game. It also has some extra rules, which make sieges fun. (for example when you go for a siege, you have to decide how much grain you will bring with you)<br/><br/>The good side of the game is that the Hungarian and the Turkish sides really differ from each other, and need completely different playing styles.<br/><br/>Of course, the game has a downside. The amount of administration needed to play might cause the casual player to never sit down and play a game.<br/><br/>This game is great in Hungarian history, and shows those times, which were so full with death, battles and instability.<br/><br/>"}, "27504": {"boardgamedesigner": {"7571": {"name": "Pete Blockley"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Schwerpunkt: Divisional Level WW2 Fast Play Rules 1920-1950", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2070": "Simulation"}, "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic299356_t.jpg", "average": "4", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic299356.jpg", "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": {"1047": {"name": "Miniatures"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "Schwerpuckt is a set of miniature rules for playing large WW2 battles.

In the Indian epic - the Ramayana, Dasharatha, Rama's father is forced by an old promise to send Rama, his eldest son away to the forest for fourteen years. Rama is accompanied by his wife Sita and brother, Lakshmana. Vanavaas - the Adventures in the Forest follows their experiences until the kidnapping of Sita. In the second game, the Search for Sita, you follow the adventures of Rama and Lakshmana as they search for Sita and seek the help of the vanaras or monkeys. Hanuman finally finds Sita in Lanka where she is a prisoner of the demon king - Ravana. Rama and Lakshmana, along with their new friends Sugriva and Hanuman decide that the only option is to fight a war with Ravana and rescue Sita. It was a mighty battle fought between the rakshasas led by Ravana and the vanara army led by Rama. This game brings you face to face with some of the unforgettable characters like Kumbakarna, Indrajit and Jambavan. It also introduces you to many of the special powers that gave both sides the numerous advantages. Rama is invincible and represents the Power of Good. However, in the epic he is told to seek the assistance of the vanaras led by Sugriva. It is this that led to the concept of the game. The game is based on C. Rajagopalachari's Ramayana in English.

Players alternate operating with a force and Leader of their choosing, trying to outmaneuver their opponents and lever them out of commanding positions, opening up strategic objectives.

In this 3-6 player map, players compete to build and deliver goods to steamboats which are moving up and down the Mississippi River. Instead of urbanizing towns into cities, players use the Steamboat Building action to build steamboats outside of port cities. Delivering to a steamboat provides players with a 1 income bonus, and goods can be transported from and through steamboats as well. Each turn, the steamboats move a certain number of spaces up or down the river.<br/><br/>Age of Steam Expansion: Golden Spike: This Age of Steam expansion takes place in 1860&rsquo;s Western USA, where the Union Pacific Railroad and the Central Pacific Railroad raced towards each other in order to complete the first transcontinental railroad system with the Golden Spike. This is a 4-player team-dependent map, with players delivering goods to cities along the main route to build more track towards Promontory; if one side reaches before the other, their opponents are eliminated. The map starts with pre-printed &quot;hidden&quot; track tiles which are revealed each time a good is delivered to a city along the main Sacramento/Promontory/Omaha line. The game ends on the turn that at least one team reaches Promontory; if both teams reach it, victory points are tabulated as usual. If only one team reaches it, the other team's score is reduced to zero (but the winning team still determines each of their score using the traditional manner).<br/><br/>This expansion is professionally designed, printed and mounted on double-sided gameboard, just like the original Age of Steam map.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"25289": "Bezier Games Edition"}, "average": "7.13984", "name": "Age of Steam Expansion: Mississippi Steamboats / Golden Spike", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "120", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "expands": {"4098": {"name": "Age of Steam"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"86": "Age of Steam"}}, "27523": {"boardgamedesigner": {"233": {"name": "Johann R\u00fcttinger"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Minz, Maunz und Bello", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1986", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"7334": "Animals: Cats"}, "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic177200_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"304": {"name": "Noris Spiele"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic177200.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"251513": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "What's going on in the kitchen ?<br/><br/>The little kittens awake on the couch and are hungry.

Like its predecessors, Sport of Kings, Cockpit of Europe and Charlie's Year, it examines the War of the Austrian Succession at an operational level. Italy is the stage this time. Physically isolated from the titanic struggles in Germany and the Low Countries, Italy was anything but a backwater: successes and failures here had an important impact on the war as a whole. The war for Italy opened at the beginning of 1742. The Spanish Crown, after lengthy preparations, successfully invaded Italy by sea, bent on acquiring a duchy for the Queen's son, Don Felipe, and on reclaiming Spanish dominance in the region. Distracted by events elsewhere, the Habsburgs and their British allies were unable to prevent this move, but soon rebounded, drawing as a reluctant partner the pre-eminent local power, Piedmont-Sardinia, and its Frederician-like ruler, Charles Emmanuel of the House of Savoy.<br/><br/>QG can accommodate up to four players, though it is easily played with two, and can even be played solitaire. The four sides are Bourbon France, Bourbon Spain, the Habsburg Empire, and Savoy (Piedmont-Sardinia). Also available are the forces of Genoa, Modena, Venice, Naples, and some pesky Royal Marines. Other territories, like the Papal States, wield influence rather than the sword.<br/><br/>A game on the War of Austrian Succession in Italy.

Stratagame is as much about skillful diplomacy as is it about chess-like strategic know-how. The player who in the end owns most of the continent&rsquo;s resources wins this game of epic adventure.<br/><br/>Stratagame is a strategy game in which 2 to 6 players try to capture the continent&rsquo;s resources. Stratagame is played on a chessboard roughly representing Europe. There are no countries or clearly defined territories in Stratagame. Stratagame has no preset historic framework and no realistic pretensions, therefore Stratagame is not a wargame or a simulation game. Stratagame combines the mechanics of games like chess with modern strategy principles. Compared to other games in its category , Stratagame has been designed to be simple and easily understood. There are no overly complex or difficult rules in Stratagame and the manual has only 6 pages of rules. However, as like chess, the simplicity of the rules does not guarantee an easy mastery of the game. Stratagame is generally played in 2 to 4 hours, depending on the number of players and strategies involved.<br/><br/>Stratagame contains 6 armies of different colors each composed of 52 playing pieces. As like chess, when a playing piece tries to enter a square already occupied by an enemy piece, a combat occurs. Each playing piece has a Strength of 1 to 5. A playing piece&rsquo;s Strength determines the number of dice it rolls during combat. The piece obtaining the highest result on the dice wins the combat.

Players have 14 characters to choose from all based on role playing archetypes, such as heroes, wizards, villains, thieves, monsters, etc.  The game makes players feel they are traveling the world to find equipment, weapons, ancient relics, and companions that will help them on their quest to acquire the Crown of Command.  Along the way they visit various locales in the worlds, battle each other and fantastic creatures to make their way to the top.<br/><br/>Goal:<br/><br/>Each player is trying to move from the outer world and ultimately to the inner world. Players wander the outer, middle, and inner worlds trying to acquire equipment, weapons, and companions.  They will also improve statistics with equipment, companions, and encounters and battles with fantasy creatures and each other.  Once they complete a Talisman quest, players will enter the inner world and face its challenges to finally reach the Portal of Power to claim the Crown of Command.  Then the other players must race to stop this player before he eventually kills them all with the Command spell.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>To begin, players select a character card from among the 14 provided.  Characters have basic statistics to start.  These are Life [hit points], Strength [physical prowess], and Craft [Magic and Intelligence].  Some characters are naturally more gifted in combat and others in magic, while others are mix of the two.  Additionally characters are often differentiated with unique abilities, starting equipment, and starting spells.  This all makes the players actually feel different during play.  In addition items and companions players acquire during play also add to statistics, increasing Strength, Craft, Life or adding new abilities, etc.<br/><br/>Actual game play is relatively simple, making the game easy to pick up with novices.  On a player's turn they throw a die for movement.  Player then chooses which direction, left or right, or if meeting qualifications may be able to move from outer to middle world, or middle to inner world.  Once on space, player follows instructions on space, or encounters face up cards already in space, or other player if in space.  Most spaces have a player draw a number of cards to encounter.  These can be creatures, companions, weapons, equipment, treasure, or relics.  Players must fight creatures and win before acquiring any other items or companions.  If another player is in the space, players may attack with either Craft or Strength but are not required to do so.  The defender defends with same statistic attacked with.  If the defender loses, he loses a life and an item or companion of attackers choice.  If the attacker loses, he loses a life.<br/><br/>Players start in the outer world, and build up their character's statistics and items to try and move to the middle world.  There are two ways to move up to the middle world, one requiring a test of strength and the other a boat man's ride for a price.  Once in the middle world, play proceeds in the same manner, but the challenge generally is increased with more threats such as the desert and temple.  However, there is more potential for encounters and items as most spaces now draw more than one card.<br/><br/>In the middle world, players may also acquire a Talisman quest, that once completed, will grant them a Talisman.  The Talisman is required to unlock the Crown of Command and pass through the Portal of Power in the Inner World.<br/><br/>Once players have a Talisman and have enough Strength or Craft to enter the Portal of Power, they will try to enter the Inner World.  There they must face and survive the guardians there, like the Vampire's Tower and Werewolf before claiming the Crown of Command.

Although the game may appear superficially as a variant of Anglo-American Checkers, it has many unusual features that are not known in any other Checkers game:<br/><br/><br/>     Men capture adjacent enemy ladies (the equivalent of kings in Checkers) by the short leap backwards, but never forwards. However, adjacent enemy men are captured by them in the usual way by leaping forwards.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     If a man reaches the opponent's back rank, he is promoted to a sleeping beauty (and turned upside down), if the player has already a lady. A player can never have two or more ladies at the same time. Sleeping beauties are inactive until they are woken up.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     A lady captures by the short leap like the king in English Draughts / American Straight Checker. A lady can also capture in the Chess way by replacement like a Ferz in Shatranj, not just by jumping.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     It is not permitted to combine both ways of capturing in one move.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Capturing by replacement is not compulsory, whereas capturing by jumping is and the greatest number possible must be captured. Consequently, jumping always takes precedence over replacement, unless a lady can capture the opponent's lady. Then the lady that captures has the choice between both ways of capturing, which is called Royal Privilege<br/><br/><br/><br/>     A sleeping beauty may not move or capture, nor may she be captured. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     After a sleeping beauty is woken up, she is permitted to make a &quot;jump of joy&quot;, a rule that was was inspired by the Kurierspiel. However, a jump of joy is only permitted if the square crossed over is (1) vacant and (2) not &quot;threatened&quot; (or &quot;guarded&quot; in Chess terminology).<br/><br/><br/><br/>     The object of the game is to leave the opponent without a valid move, either by capturing all his pieces, or by blocking them completely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     A game can never end in a draw, thus &quot;vanquishing the curse of the Checkers draw&quot; as Kerry Handscomb, the editor of the Abstract Games magazine put it. There are, however, rare positions very similar to jishogi, or impasse in Japanese Chess that need a special rule: In a continous sequence of moves in which only ladies are moved, a particular lady is not permitted to move onto the same square twice after the full board position has been repeated once (even if the lady occupied this square before the position was repeated).<br/><br/><br/><br/>     A point scoring system is used to determine the margin of win. The winner gets as many points as there are still pieces on the board (of any kind and color). The loser gets zero points, even if he has still pieces left (in the case of a blockade).<br/><br/><br/>The game has been extensively covered in the Abstract Games magazine whose Canadian editors described it as &quot;fascinating&quot; and &quot;rather strange&quot;.<br/><br/>"}, "27662": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Vamos tras Eros", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": {"2073": "Acting"}, "yearpublished": "1995", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic189208_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"6470": {"name": "Smart Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic189208.jpg", "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1030": {"name": "Party Game"}}, "age": "16", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "Which would be your answer to the question: In what exotic place and with whom do you want to have hot sex?<br/><br/>With Vamos Tras Eros you can know your friends' reactions to this kind of questions, situations and test related with love and sex.<br/><br/>Vamos Tras Eros is sexy and hot race in search of the final tile EROS, the first player to arrive will have to opportunity to.....<br/><br/>"}, "27663": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Junior Cluedo", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2047": "Memory"}, "yearpublished": "1993", "usersrated": "13", "boardgamefamily": {"71": "Cluedo"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic563013_t.jpg", "average": "5.07692", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"95": {"name": "Waddington's Games, Inc."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic563013.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"104173": "Waddingtons edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1045": {"name": "Memory"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "In this edition, the players must search each room of the mansion uncovering clues that tell them if there is a bat, a cat, or a ghost hiding in the room.

Each player starts with 4 egg-cups, in one of two colors, on the base row of the grid, with a ball on the two corner ones. The aim is to be the first player to move these cups to the baseline of the opponent and get the 2 balls again onto the 2 egg-cups on the edges. If the starting player does this first, then the opponent has the chance to get a draw if they manage to do the same thing in the turn immediately afterwards.<br/><br/>Each turn a player picks one of two moves. A player can either move one cup with a ball to a free space that touches it, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Or a player can move the ball from one of their pieces to another one of their pieces that touches it in those same directions. When a blockade occurs, by 2 rows that block each other on the center rows, the active player may jump with a piece that contains a ball over an opponent's piece. When one player still has a piece on the start line, and the opponent has filled all other end-spaces, that piece needs to vacate its space right away.

The Election of 1960 is the story of two men, John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon. One is the scion of a wealthy, politically powerful family from New England. The other is the son of a Quaker grocer in Whittier, California. While they belong to opposing political parties, they start out as friends. The complex development of that friendship, however, would shape a pivotal presidential election and cast a long shadow over American history for the remainder of the 20th century.<br/><br/>&quot;In 1960: The Making of the President, you take on the role of one of these great protagonists vying for the right to lead his country into the heart of the Cold War. However, it is not just foreign policy that poses a challenge to American leadership; this is also an era of great social turmoil and progress. As the United States continues to build upon the promise of its founding, candidates must contend with the question of civil rights and balance their positions on social justice against the need for valuable Southern electoral votes. Of course, the ever-present issue of the economy also rears its ugly head, and both Nixon and Kennedy will compete to be the candidate with the voters' pocket books in mind.<br/><br/>&quot;The contest is fought out on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960&mdash;a map where Louisiana and Florida share the same number of electoral votes, as do California and Pennsylvania. Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon&rsquo;s lazy shave, President Eisenhower&rsquo;s late endorsement, and the 'Catholic question' are all included as specific event cards. The famous televised debates and final election day push are each handled with their own subsystems. Candidates vie to capture each state&rsquo;s electoral votes using campaign points in the four different regions of the country. At the same time, they must build momentum by dominating the issues of the day and attempt to gain control of the airwaves.<br/><br/>&quot;As with any election campaign, the challenge is to adapt your game plan as the ground shifts out from under you. There are never enough resources or time to do everything, but you need to make the tough calls to propel yourself into the White House. This fast-playing strategy game for two players challenges you to run for the most powerful elective office in the world, at one of its most unique crossroads. Will you recreate history, or rewrite it? 1960: The Making of the President provides you the opportunity to do both.&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"26839": "Filosofia French edition"}, "average": "7.56687", "name": "1960: The Making of the President", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "7060", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"14835": "Country: USA"}}, "27709": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Pennant", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2070": "Simulation"}, "yearpublished": "1977", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": {"5586": "Sports: Baseball"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic180955_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5969": {"name": "Destiny"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic180955.jpg", "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1038": {"name": "Sports"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "The tag line for the game is &quot;Play an entire season in just a couple of hours&quot;.

It is also a time when a small group of men rose against all odds amassing great fortunes and political power by laying their steel ribbons across America's vast plains and over her towering and majestic mountains. These were America's RAIL MASTERS....<br/><br/>The year is 1862 and President Lincoln has just signed the Pacific Railroad Act granting you $100,000 and a steam locomotive. Your assignment is to safely travel across the United States and deliver five special spikes to your holding company.  The first Railroad to deliver all five spikes wins.<br/><br/>Who will be the next RAIL MASTER?&quot;<br/><br/>The Rail Masters Trust Company is a Trivial Pursuit inspired train trivia game with added economic and pick up and deliver mechanics. Players take the role of one of six holding companies from 1862 and start with $100,000 granted by the government. Starting from the roundhouse, players roll and move around the board answering train trivia questions to get extra moves. There are six spike squares of five different colors the players are aiming to land on where they can purchase a spike from the government. The train playing pieces have slots to hold two spikes maximum, so spikes must be delivered to the roundhouse before more can be picked up.

Pirate warehouses are equivalent to settlements in Catan, and the player receive resources from these warehouses whenever a die roll matches the number showing on that island. These resources take the form of equipment cards, and the resources are wood, wool, rum, sabers and gold. With these, players construct ships and more pirate warehouses or buy development cards. Instead of a robber, players must now beware of a Ghost Pirate, which can block the resources normally provided by a warehouse.<br/><br/>Each player starts with two pirate warehouses, and the first player to build seven warehouses wins. In order to build a new warehouse, however, a player must go by ship from an existing warehouse to a new construction site, which thus keeps players alternating between constructing ships and warehouses.<br/><br/>Aside from the change in theme, other changes between The Settlers of Catan and Catan: Junior include the elimination of cities (i.e., warehouses can't be upgraded) and the distance rule between settlements, resources allocated by the roll of one die instead of a pair of D6s, and the introduction of a marketplace that allows trading with the bank. At the start of the game, one equipment card of each type is placed in the marketplace; on a player's turn, he can exchange one card in hand for a card in the marketplace.

This game uses an updated, and slightly expanded, version of the Bitter Victory game system: no CRT, buckets o&rsquo; dice, and cards...a totally new approach to gaming battles that can be learned in five minutes and played in 2-3 hours.<br/><br/>Most of the rules and mechanics will be familiar to anyone who has ever played a wargame. BSO Games, however, has added to this simplicity a combat system that rates units for how many dice they get to roll on their behalf, as well as what kind of dice (small arms or Heavy Weapons). No CRTs, no siree!<br/><br/>The game also uses cards, one deck (of 10) for each player (whose cards are somewhat different from those of the other player) to enhance the game. (They don't &quot;drive&quot; the game and they can be left out, if you&rsquo;re so inclined.) The cards are part of a Resource system that gives the players a number of points which they can use to buy cards, rally units or bring in Reinforcements. The choice is theirs, but there are far more choices than points.<br/><br/>The cards, themselves, give the players &quot;Opportunities&quot;, from using their (or negating their opponent&rsquo;s) tank capabilities, to getting more supplies, to special Breakthrough and Reaction movement.<br/><br/>Playing time for Blackshirthas averaged less than 3 hours, and the rules are only 6 pages, including rules for playing Solitaire.<br/><br/>Each game of Blackshirt includes Rules, one sheet of Mike Lemick&rsquo;s colorful cut-and-paste counters, two small decks of cards, and a snappy Pascal da Silva map (in one piece!)&quot;<br/><br/>Available in English or French<br/>1 rules and scenario booklet with historical introduction (8 pages)<br/>1 A3 map of Lybia and Egypt - 20 colored Opportunity Cards - 140 counters (NATO Symbols) -<br/>The Sicily map and the Opportunity Cards have been designed by Pascal Da Silva<br/><br/>Uses the Same System As:<br/><br/>    Bitter Victory<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Reimplimented by: Blood & Sand published by Worthington Games<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"188498": "First edition"}, "average": "6", "name": "Blackshirt", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2018": "Campaign / Battle Card Driven"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"4260": "Bitter Victory Family"}}, "27822": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Hammer Horror Forbidden Terrortory", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "7", "boardgamefamily": {"7348": "DVD Board Games"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic182450_t.jpg", "average": "5.57143", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2933": {"name": "Britannia Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic182450.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"282441": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Players try and rescue a Victim whilst trying to destroy Dracula before he gets uber strong.

For example, if you're one space away from a pivot with a piece that has three arrows (and is pointing at the pivot), you can move one space onto the pivot, rotate your piece, then move the remaining one or two spaces in any direction now indicated by the piece's arrows.<br/><br/>You capture movement arrows two ways:<br/><br/>&bull; Land on an opponent's piece, and you remove a movement arrow of your choice, then place that piece on an unoccupied blue pivot space in any direction you wish.<br/>&bull; Jump an opponent's piece, then remove the one or two arrows on that piece that are parallel to your direction of movement.<br/><br/>You win by being the first player to capture 17 of your opponent's movement arrows.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"144710": "English first edition"}, "name": "Blindside", "playingtime": "25", "boardgamemechanic": {"2011": "Modular Board"}, "average": "6.13704", "usersrated": "27", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "age": "10"}, "27858": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Locuras", "playingtime": "75", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "yearpublished": "1997", "usersrated": "10", "maxplayers": "24", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic189655_t.jpg", "average": "4.915", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4680": {"name": "Borras Plana S.A."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic189655.jpg", "maxplaytime": "75", "boardgamecategory": {"1039": {"name": "Deduction"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "75", "description": "Locuras (spanish word for Craziness) This a Spanish party game that has different categories:<br/><br/>     10 questions (guess the character)<br/>     Logic (Jeroglif, Tangram and logic questions)<br/>     Trivia<br/>     Drawing (based on a specific starring figure)<br/>     Words (9 dice with letters)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>A very singular thing about this game, is that it doesn&rsquo;t have a sand clock for the time.

You can bribe the different people in the game to attack your opponents and take their items from them. You may battle opponents when you land on the same square as them deciding which items to use in each different situation. You may warp to different areas of the board using the tunnel either to attack an opponent or strategically move into a position which is more beneficial.

Pick up Destainia cards and follow the instructions of the card which may be to your advantage or to your peril. The object of the game is to move along the board purchasing different items from stores along the way. Each item you buy has points, and once you have achieved enough points you will be able to challenge and defeat the Sorcerer.

It belonged to a childhood friend--a gift from the designer, if I recall correctly--and I've never seen it in a store.<br/><br/>To the best of my recollection, there were similarities to roll 'n' move games such as PayDay or Life:  The board was a simple figure-eight track around which the playing pieces would move, and each space had some sort of action or consequence for the player; there were also free spaces that required no activity.  In addition, there were stock certificates that could be purchased and/or traded as well as cards to be drawn at certain points; the cards also had ramifications for the player, similar to the Chance/Community Chest cards in Monopoly.<br/><br/>I'm afraid I don't recall the specific mechanics--obviously the notion of inflation was part of the game--but the essential goal was to remain solvent and earn more money than your opponent(s).  My recollection is that the game ended when a certain period of time had passed, most likely defined by a set number of laps around the board.  I enjoyed the game quite a bit when I was a kid:  It seemed more sophisticated and complex than its roll 'n' move cousins, and I recall there being a number of potential activities to be undertaken with each turn.<br/><br/>I would love to hear from anyone else who has played this rare gem.

As inflation becomes worse and the cost of living increases, each player must meet his daily expenses, while making sure his salary keeps pace with current prices. Most Importantly, each player must keep his job in order to avoid certain financial disaster. Although provisions have been made for only six players, any number may participate.

Morgana the Empress of the Crystal Elf Empire sits upon the Peacock Throne with her younger son Mordred at her knee, she has ruled a thousand years and in her resides the best chance to halt the decay.<br/><br/>Maelstrome is a fantasy mass combat system based in part on the famous Slaughterloo game and it features many of the same races and creatures that players will already be familiar with, though they are much changed.  Alongside the Crystal Elves, progenitors of the Ferach, are the Krautan Dwarves members of a League encompassing hundreds of small baronies and thiefdoms.  The Krautans are next in strength to the Crystal Empire and more powerful than the Cities of Man that have appeared across the central continent.   Other organized states try to hang onto the vestiges of a disappearing civilization but it has not been easy for the Undead led by the sinister Necromancers and the Dragon Children or Dracci have rampaged across Valon embroiled in their own huge war that decimates all who fall in its path.<br/><br/>From the frozen north the shambling Undead have crumbled many societies and created free booters and mercenaries who sell their swords to the highest bidders, among them the Gnome Legion and the Dogmen of Stasia.  It is in Alevia a former province of the Crystal Empire that the mighty Elf regiments make their stand against the Undead and the Dracci.  It is from the vast sea in the south beyond Ibe-Herra that the Dragons came bringing carnage to the Goblin Principalities behind their wooden walls and forming an alliance of convenience with the fawning Lizardmen.  Savage Orc tribes migrate across all these battle torn lands bringing more pain, though as always their enemies loose flights of barbed arrows upon their approach.<br/><br/>Choose your side carefully in the Maelstrome for though you may admire the remorseless Necromancers or the fury of the Dracci the other races have much to offer.  March with the Imperial Elf Regiments or the Regiments of the Wood Elves not forgetting the armies of Man or the Orc Tribes.  All can hire warriors from a common pool of fighters, entire units of Ogres, Mountain Orcs even Gnomes who kill with hundred tiny blades.  Do not forget of course that your army must have a powerful Mage to wield Wylde Magick in a nimbus of power to pour on your foes each race sports different lethal incantations.  Also you can use a Beast Handler to control huge savage monsters that are the doom of a multitude of soldiers, War Trolls and Corpse Monsters assembled from piles of the recently dead.<br/><br/>Once this army of yours is assembled and stands ready uniforms bright or armour rusted and well used you must select a Warlord and special leaders to drive your units forward.

Its main purpose is to recreate the Tour de France in its entirety over 14 stage sessions, with each player in charge of a team of 8 riders with individual abilities.<br/><br/>But what you get, in essence, is a highly flexible modular stage construction kit that allows you to create a wide range of possible races for 6 teams of 8 riders each, using 136 plain-colored terrain tiles in 5 colors. And although its scope is for an entire Tour, it is equally feasible to play only a single stage, recreate other tours and existing one-day classics, or embark on a completely made-up race. Saying that, a lot of the dynamics only come into play when team managers aren't only trying to snatch the stage victory from their competitors, but need to keep an eye on the overall rankings for each individual rider as well, as the end goal is to carry the Yellow Jersey to Paris. More so, and just like in the real Tour, the Sprint and Mountain Tricots are also up for grabs, so during each race it is important to get your key riders in point-scoring positions at the right time.<br/><br/>This dice-driven racing simulation includes rules for terrain handling, breakaways, tempo raising, slipstreaming, pack-splitting, sprints, fatigue, doping-use, overtaking, falls, team-cooperation and other events, but squeezes all this in a simple system that does not bogs down in details or oodles of bookkeeping.<br/><br/>By stripping the inner workings of a cycling race down to core mechanics that are based around only 4 different types of terrain tile (flat, uphill, downhill, and - to settle communal arrivals - sprints), the game instead concentrates on the different abilities of each rider to use certain types of terrain to his advantage. These abilities, again, are stripped down to their core. Team sheets show 8 unique riders, each with 4 to 8 special action points in specific terrain colours, that get covered when used. Remarkably, this is enough creates a race dynamic that is genuinely similar to the real deal. Servants will be used to get the specialists in position, or bridge gaps to escaped groups or soloists. The stronger riders will use their abilities to snatch points on their favourite type of terrain, and the team champions will be protected by their team members for most of the race, but ultimately need to rely on their superior movement bonuses to battle it out amongst each other. Often, the mountain stages are key arenas that shape the face of the remaining Tour, when riders no longer can rely on group efforts, and have to face the long uphill climb on individual strength alone. Each stage, team leaders will need to balance the need for interteam co-operation against their individual team's chances to gain an advantage. Sounds familiar?<br/><br/>During the race, the starting pack will slowly split up in individual packs, smaller groups (2-7 riders) and soloists, all standing on their own terrain tiles in small stacks of numbered plastic pieces in the 6 team colors (for larger packs replacement markers are used). In a standard turn, the top cyclist on each tile-stack will throw the D20, and move 1 forwards on an odd roll, and 2 tiles on an even, taking the entire underlying stack along through slipstreaming. That cyclist will then have spent his energy and move to the bottom of the stack, handing over the front position to the next one in line. From the head of the race down, each tile with riders will be dealt with in turn, and that process repeats itself until all riders have completed the stage, or are disqualified for arriving too late, with a bigger time-gap to the leader than allowed.<br/><br/>Each standard (group) move can be modified by one special move if managers so desire, and if they have the rider(s) that can pull it off on that type of terrain. This special move can either be a breakaway attempt, a general raising of the tempo, a deliberately go-slow decision by the speed-setting rider, or a tactical manoeuvre that can cause a pack to split. Each time a rider uses a speciality point, it is marked off from his entry on the team sheet. When the last ability point has been covered up, that rider is too tired to pull off any further special moves. A rider that has spent all his bonus points will start the next stage fatigued, whereas a rider that has spared himself will enter the next stage with a bonus point, just like the new holder of the Yellow Jersey. When the race leader changes terrain type, a random event is triggered that can befall any rider in the race.<br/><br/>When more than 1 rider arrives at a sprint banner, the top of a mountain, or the finish line, a sprint is triggered to settle the differences. Riders who can draw on team support, or are natural sprinters can use this to start the sprint in advantageous positions.<br/><br/>This is a great game for fans of the cycling genre, but might be a tad repetitive for others, especially when a lot of team managers join the race and when the starting pack splits up in many different groups. It then takes quite a few die rolls before the 50 to 90 tile route has been conquered by all. As a sport simulation, it works best when a full field of riders is present, and when an entire tour is played out over multiple sessions. If you play individual stages only, the race dynamics are far less colourful since the team managers only need to focus on getting one rider through the finish line, rather than juggle positions, general fitness, and overall rankings of their entire team of riders.<br/><br/>Included with the set are the assembly instructions for the 14 stages, and team sheets for each team manager, detailing the individual abilities of 8 unique (real-life) riders from the 1995 tour. It isn't clear if the brothers intended to supply updated packs for subsequent tours and races, but enthusiasts have.<br/><br/>PUBLICATION HISTORY:<br/><br/>     1995 Maillot Jaune Inauen Spiele - handmade limited edition - out of print<br/>     1996 Le Tour Inauen Spiele - handmade re-issue - out of print<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Maillot Jaune was Patrick's debut game, and was launched at the Schweizer Spielmesse in 1995, where it sold all of 13 stickered white cardboard boxes.

Specially stamped poker chips are used in bidding for cards.  Besides the rules and a score pad, the game came with a green felt playing surface with a map of the world and other significant items in white.  This surface is known in the rules as &quot;the traditional green table of diplomacy&quot;.  The game came in two types of boxes, one a padded leatherette style and the other a red paper covered cardboard with trays to hold the cards and chips.  The smaller red box has a pocket inside the lid to hold the rules and score pad.<br/><br/>Four players is the optimum number, though rules are given for a three player game.  The four players represent the United States, Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and either France or Germany, as picked by the dealer.  Play then proceeds until one player has built up a hand through either draws, auction, or trading large enough to declare his peculiar pax based on his political leanings.<br/><br/>The four types of Paxes are:<br/>Pax Americana<br/>Pax Muscovita<br/>Pax Atlantica (the English Pax)<br/>Pax Europeana (French or German Pax)<br/><br/>The game betrays its Cold War background by some of the interesting art and factoids on the cards, which are about three times the size of playing cards and are quite colorful with period artwork.  The rules are a scant two pages, but are easily picked up by any traditional card players who are familiar with bridge.  Certain cards are usable only with certain Paxes and vary in value.

Using tried and true mechanics but with some major twists, Tide at Sunrise will be a major test of player skill that is rarely seen in the wargaming hobby. Here, the base system is little more than the tried and true game from SPI called Napoleon at Waterloo. But not all is at it seems.<br/><br/>Here is the sequence of play:<br/><br/>Japanese Player Turn<br/><br/>* Naval Phase<br/>    * Transport Allocation<br/>    * Movement Phase<br/>    * Combat Phase<br/>    * Replacement and Recovery<br/><br/>Russian Player Turn<br/><br/>* Colonel Akashi Secret Operations Phase<br/>    * Transport Allocation Phase<br/>    * Movement Phase<br/>    * Combat Phase<br/>    * Supply and Recovery Phase<br/><br/>After the completion of both Player Turns, victory points are determined and, if the Japanese have not won a sudden death win, play continues to the next turn.<br/><br/>The game focuses on two aspects of the actual event. Players have to manage their armies using an abstract logistical system called &ldquo;Transport Points&rdquo; in the game. The Japanese Transport Points are an abstraction of the merchant marine force that the Japanese had available in 1904 and 1905. This can be disrupted from Russian naval activity. The Russian Transport Points are an abstraction of the rail capacity of the newly built Trans-Siberian Railroad. Weather can affect this total if there are heavy snows in Siberia. Colonel Akashi can also stir up trouble and reduce the available Russian Transport totals with sudden strikes and riots in the Russian heartland. Both players use these points to bring on new forces and to replace battlefield losses. Finding the right balance of the two uses is key to being successful in the game.<br/><br/>Secondly, players must find the delicate balance between defending and attacking on two separate fronts. How much defends and attacks towards the all-important port of Port Arthur and how much attacks or holds the tough mountain passes of Manchuria - the key to the open plains to the north &ndash; where terrain is less defensible and victory points are everywhere.<br/><br/>Victory in the game is determined by success in the naval war, the capture of key terrain objectives and enemy losses.<br/><br/>Game components:<br/><br/>* One 22&rdquo; by 39&rdquo; full color map<br/>    * 140 1/2&rdquo; land formation counters<br/>    * 44 1 1/4&rdquo; by 5/8&rdquo; ship counters<br/>    * 16 page full color rulebook<br/><br/>Game summary:<br/><br/>* Playtime: 3-5 hours<br/>    * Complexity: Simple<br/>    * Solitaire rating: excellent<br/><br/>Game scale:<br/><br/>* Turns: 12 (each turn represents one month of real time)<br/>    * Counters: Divisions and Brigades for the land units, Capital Ships for the naval units<br/>    * Hex scale: 10 kilometers<br/><br/>Game Credits:<br/><br/>* Designer: Yukihiro Kuroda<br/>    * Developer: Adam Starkweather<br/>    * Graphic Artist: Niko Eskubi<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"83592": "Multi-Man Publishing first print edition"}, "average": "7.18333", "name": "The Tide at Sunrise: The Russo-Japanese War, 1904-1905", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "189", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"10634": "Country: Japan"}}, "27966": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Chips are Down", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1970", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"5607": "3D Games"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic185020_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"153": {"name": "Ideal"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic185020.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"109748": "Ideal Edition 1970"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This is a guessing game from Ideal.

One player plays the Germans and their allies (the Axis) and the other plays the Soviets. While paper and cardboard cannot possibly simulate a large-scale war, this game does attempt to model some of the significant aspects of the conflict, and also give the players an idea of the problems their historical counterparts faced.<br/><br/>Masahiro Yamazaki has long been considered the East Front specialist in Japan. His games - including the excellent Stalingrad Pocket by the Gamers - have been enjoyed by English gamers since 1992. Now, for the first time, MMP is very proud to present his ultimate vision of the War in Russia. With over 10 years of development and expertise, Masahiro has culled all of his talents to give you the finest game on the entire Eastern Front of World War Two.<br/><br/>Red Star Rising is part of the International Games Series (IGS) from Multi-Man Publishing (MMP). Using a variant of the popular Victory in the West chit pull system, but with some very novel twists, Masahiro presents the theater as never before.

Each unit in the Master Set has a movement rating which is the number of hexes it can move in a turn. Moving up a level counts as a hex; moving down does not incur that penalty. Moving down more levels than your height when moving from one hex to another counts as falling and you might take damage - unless you are falling into water.<br/><br/>Combat in the game is fairly straightforward. You roll attack dice as listed on your unit's card under attack, and the opponent rolls defense dice equal to the defense number on their unit's card. Skulls rolled in excess of shields count as wounds. When the number of wounds equals the unit's life value, it is killed and removed from the board.<br/><br/>The master game uses a point system in which players alternate drafting cards until they reach the pre-assigned point value for the scenario. It's possible to bring a &quot;pre-fab&quot; army to the battle in order to save time.<br/><br/>The game is eminently customizable, with many expansions which add more abilities, terrain, and options. There are also user-created maps, scenarios, custom units and advanced rules available online.<br/><br/>From the publisher:<br/>For years the Marro have been summoned to Valhalla to expand the will of Utgar at all costs. But rumors are spreading that within the uncharted jungle there is an even greater menace waiting. A great Marro Hive, hidden deep within in the jungle swamps and treacherous rock is continuously spawning new savage predators. These creatures, said to be venomous Marro, perhaps even Hivelords, will emerge from their colony and contaminate the world. Includes 24 detailed miniature figures and 75 interlocking terrain pieces.<br/><br/>This new Master Set includes everything you need to start your own adventures in the Heroscape world of Valhalla! There are 2 new Terrain Types: Swamp &amp; Swamp Water, as well as more Grass, Sand, Rock, and Water tiles to add to your existing Heroscape battlefields.<br/><br/>Also included in the set are 7 Unique Heroes, and 3 Common Marro Squads. However, the big news is the inclusion of the Marro Hive. The Hive has special powers directly relating to Common Marro Squad figures.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"20970": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "average": "7.62786", "name": "Heroscape Master Set: Swarm of the Marro", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "2030", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4667": "Customizable Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"35": "Heroscape"}}, "27977": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Official Radio Baseball Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "1935", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"5586": "Sports: Baseball"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic185561_t.jpg", "average": "4", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5750": {"name": "Toy Creations"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic185561.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"153894": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1064": {"name": "Movies / TV / Radio theme"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "OFFICIAL RADIO BASEBALL board game.
