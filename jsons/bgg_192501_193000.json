Your prediction for recovery is &ldquo;not likely.&rdquo;  You built pre-generated characters for this campaign six months and four character levels ago!  You don&rsquo;t want your player to sit and read the newspaper for the next 5.75 hours.  You need a comparable-level character sheet quickly.<br/><br/>OR&hellip; A new player has just shown up to your table willing to learn to sling dice.  You found out he or she was coming thirty minutes before game time.  Your regular crew of miscreants has already killed off all the spare pre-generated characters you rolled up with gleeful abandon, while cackling wildly and uttering something about &ldquo;drive &lsquo;em like you stole &lsquo;em.&rdquo;  You want this first gaming experience to be fun and memorable, so you don&rsquo;t want to completely wing it.  You need a character sheet, right now.<br/><br/>Welcome to Instant Character!  Just add a player, and go!  In this product, you will discover twenty complete stat blocks for a single PC, level 1 through 20, adhering to the Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game rules.  The core format adheres to the standard non-player character (NPC) stat block most GMs are already familiar with minus the Tactics section.  This makes it easier for the GM to assist with finding information and also prepares the player for the day he or she is running games!  The Special Abilities section includes more detailed write-ups of feats and character abilities than a standard NPC stat block to facilitate faster play.  Sources for spells, races, classes, archetypes, and prestige classes from sources other than the Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook&trade; (PZO1110) are listed in the Sources section and can be referenced in the Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game Reference Document.<br/><br/>At the end of this document is a sheet of character and spell tokens including a token for this character and assorted Non-Player Characters (NPCs) and spell effects.  For best results, print the token page and laminate the entire sheet.  Initially cut out into squares.  To improve ability to move and pick up the laminated tokens, trim off the gray corners to make an octagonal shape.<br/><br/>"}, "192603": {"rpgartist": ["Robert Hemminger"], "statistics": [], "name": "Heroes Weekly (Vol 5, Issue 4 - The Inquisition)", "rpgdesigner": ["A.

Each Assault Carrier is a potent instrument of conversion and compliance, capable of deploying thousands of troops and numerous fighter craft, backed by an array of devastating energy projectors that can burn entire continents to ash: a single CAS is sufficient to quell all but the most pernicious heresy, rebellion, or parasite outbreak. Colossally expensive to construct and few in number, the rare loss of an Assault Carrier is mourned by the entire Covenant.<br/><br/>Every major Covenant fleet has at least one Assault Carrier at its heart, if only because carriers themselves require a significant number of support vessels when operating away from High Charity or major outposts. Multiple carriers in a single fleet is unusual, but not unheard of. For example, the crusading Fleet of Sacred Consecration, commanded by the Prophet of Regret himself, is led by twin Assault Carriers, the Solemn Penance and Day of Jubilation.

Early development builds of the game were made available via its official website. The game's premise centers upon a jealous schoolgirl, Ayano Aishi, nicknamed Yandere-chan after the Japanese term &quot;yandere&quot;, who has decided to eliminate anyone she believes is monopolizing her crush's attention.Gameplay<br/><br/>Players will control Ayano Aishi (also known as &quot;Yandere-chan&quot;), a psychotic Japanese schoolgirl who has developed a crush on a fellow student currently named Taro Yamada, nicknamed &quot;Senpai&quot;. They are given 10 weeks. Every week, a new rival will appear and will get a crush on Senpai. (Note: currently, the player is only given 5 days, as this game is still being developed, therefore, you cannot win. 10 weeks will be in the final version of the game) You will have to eliminate her before she confesses her love to him. This can be accomplished by the player via several methods such as murdering the individual, kidnapping them, socially sabotaging them to the point where they commit suicide, or make them fall in love with another student by playing as Cupid. If a player chooses to murder someone they must clean up any evidence (such as the murder weapon and your bloody clothes) and/or dispose of the body via an incinerator or dumpster on the school's grounds, and mop up the blood. Otherwise, the crimes can be linked back to &quot;Yandere-chan&quot; and result in her being arrested. Players must also ensure that their crimes are not witnessed by Senpai, which will result in the loss of the game. The gameplay takes place only on the school's campus, a town, and the character's house, and players must ensure that they monitor several factors such as &quot;Yandere-chan's&quot; sanity level and reputation. If either becomes too low this can affect gameplay. The player also has the ability to change &quot;Yandere-chan's&quot; panties, each pair of panties will give them different abilities such as bonuses when gossiping or complimenting.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Yandere Simulator&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "192633": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2870731.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jacob Bofferding", "Shawn Roberts"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Shawn Roberts"], "boardgamepublisher": ["burn artists"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2870731_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Humor", "Party Game", "Political"], "description": "Greater Evil is a strategic version of the game &ldquo;Bullshit,&rdquo; with a political twist.

Card driven, area movement, low counter density, quick play and simple to learn, all make REVOLUTION ROAD a wonderful introduction To the American Revolution and to to war-gaming. Its wealth of historical information makes it an ideal teaching tool.<br/><br/>Although the scale between the games is decidedly different the same rules apply with only slight differences. BOSTON TO CONCORD is a game of maneuver, very chess-like. For the Patriot player it involves alarming the countryside with night-riders, mustering militia and trying to fend off the best infantry in the world. For the British it is playing hide and seek with Patriot Arms caches as he ferrets out Sons of Liberty troublemakers and then tries to make it back to waiting reinforcements as the Patriot forces grow to unmanageable size.<br/><br/>Bunker Hill is a different animal altogether, a basic slug-fest. The Patriot player faces a growing tide of redcoats who threaten to overwhelm his defense works on every turn. Patriots face disappearing ammunition, flanking, panic and optional rules for alternate British landing sites. As casualties mount historic leaders try desperately to rally their men and bring about the miraculous result reflected upon by British General Henry Clinton when he declared &quot;It was a dear-bought victory; another such would have ruined us.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "192635": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2860130.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Lorenz Kutschke"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Oliver Freudenreich"], "boardgamepublisher": ["N\u00fcrnberger-Spielkarten-Verlag", "White Goblin Games"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2860130_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Card Game"], "description": "Every player starts Life Is Life with five life cards, and things only go downhill from there.<br/><br/>To set up a round, shuffle the sixty-card deck, deal ten cards face down to each player, then place ten cards face up on the table in four rows, with the rows holding 1-4 cards.

Known as the Northwest Indian War, Little Turtle's War and Washington's Indian War, this was the first major challenge to President Washington and his army following the conclusion of the Revolutionary War. Spanning from 1785 to 1795, the conflict grew out of a dispute over territorial boundaries following the war, aggravated by settlers flooding across the Ohio to claim Ohio lands then in possession of Native American nations.<br/><br/>The Miami and Shawnee were the principal tribes involved but in time they created a loose alliance with numerous other tribes and together they dealt the U.S. the worst defeat by Indians in the history of our Indian Wars. Washington sent three separate expeditions against them. The first two were handily defeated. The third and final expedition led by General &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne ended the conflict with his victory at The Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794.<br/><br/>This design is similar to KING PHILIP'S WAR published by MMP in 2010. It is point to point movement, using a three dice simultaneous battle system with variable reinforcements on both sides, special action points, alliances and treaties, and frustratingly undependable American militia. The American army operates out of forts, the Indians out of villages. Every two turns both players enter into quartering which in effect resets the board. Destroyed Indian villages are relocated while additional forts and settlements may be built as the game progresses. Indians raiding is a quick and simple mechanism that adds color to the game. The action is hardly battle-line simple. Engagements are widespread and chaotic with surprises at every turn. Four scenarios are included - one per expedition with a campaign game that encompasses all three. Low counter density with quick and tense game play.

The game modes are Capture the Flagon, King of the Hill, Regicide, and Last Man Standing.<br/><br/>Each game mode has a different objective, winning the objective earns a player 5 victory points and ends the game. Additionally each islander kill is worth 2 Victory points, and a sailor (a minion) is wort 1 Victory point.<br/><br/>This way a player that engages strategically and racks up kills can beat a player that camps and wins the game objective.<br/><br/>Forlorn has been tested for nearly 2 years and has come to a version that favors strategy, decisive thinking and psychology.  Forlorn ultimately is a bloody strategy game with 4,495 possible different team combinations, 4 different game modes and 2-8 possible players.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "14", "name": "Forlorn", "playingtime": "100", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Hex-and-Counter", "Player Elimination", "Role Playing"], "average": "7.88889", "usersrated": "9", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "192712": {"rpgdesigner": ["Delos Adamski", "Johnn Four", "John Large"], "statistics": [], "name": "Roleplaying Tips (Issue 646)", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["Johnn Four"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2861976.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Roleplaying Tips"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Brief Word From Johnn", "D20 Wilderness Encounters", "Side Quests For Busy Groups", "The Mythic God Generator"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgpublisher": ["RoleplayingTips.com"], "rpgissueversion": ["HTML Version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2861976_t.jpg", "description": "The Mythic God Generator<br/><br/>"}, "192713": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Benjamin Gerber"], "average": "7.26316", "poll": [], "name": "Ninja: Silent But Deadly", "playingtime": "360", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "19", "boardgamefamily": ["Button Shy Wallet Games", "Ninja"], "maxplayers": "12", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2905199_t.png", "boardgameartist": ["Embla Vigfusdottir"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Button Shy"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2905199.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "360", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Party Game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Ninjas!

Coming from a distant planet they do not have peaceful intentions: they are ready to assimilate humanity to make us blue, small and flabby just like them. And since the day was not already awful enough, they want to start right from your city. They are plenty, smart and wicked, just like fag ash, but do not panic: as current lodger of planet Earth, we still have some aces in the hole to play.<br/><br/>On our side, we have unshakable field agents, tough to the bones and loyal to the cause, although limited when it is time to take action. We can also count on a brilliant group of scientists: if these eggheads could just work together, they might indeed find a way to prevent the imminent invasion... too bad that at the first warning they fled and scatter to the ends of the city! They might be braniacs but definitely miss the guts.<br/><br/>As part of the resistance, your mission is to coordinate the agents on the field and gather all the scientists before the aliens complete their plan of conquering the city. You shall send orders from your secret headquarter, but be aware: the enemy is looking for you, and if it manages to localize you, it would assimilate and bring you by its side with no hesitation! If that happens you will end up in the perfect situation to undermine all the effort of your former comrades.. the Earthlings!<br/><br/>COURSE OF THE GAME<br/><br/>The game is divided in three stages that repeat until the end of the game:<br/>1. Event execution (carried out by the architect)<br/>2. Players&lsquo; turns (carried out by all players clockwise)<br/>3. Consolidation (carried out by the architect)<br/><br/>1. Event execution <br/>The invasion is underway! At any moment an alien attack or a stroke of luck can completely change the situation...<br/><br/>The architect turns over the top card of<br/>the events deck and execute its effects.<br/>Then, he discards the card.<br/><br/>2. Players&lsquo; turns<br/><br/>Each player will be able to command agents in the city or to plan the best strategy to pursue his/her goal. Beware, though: with each action there is the risk of being detected and assimilated by aliens! The alien players may choose to stay hidden until the end of the game or to reveal themselves (without showing their cards)to be in favor with other alien players at the price of exposing themselves to the opposing faction.<br/><br/>During his/her turn a player may have to perform risky actions that require to draw a given number of assimilation cards. Once drawn, the cards must be kept secret and cannot be revealed to other players. By drawing at least<br/>one Assimilated! card a player becomes an alien. From this very moment on, his/her goal is to let the alien faction win the game! If the assimilation deck is empty the player can still perform his/her actions without drawing any card. An alien player drawing a Human card is still alien. Moreover, drawing two or more Assimilated! Cards does not change the situation.<br/>Once alien, alien forever!<br/><br/>3. Consolidation<br/><br/>After all players have completed their turn, the field is prepared for the next stages.<br/><br/>THE GOAL OF THE GAME<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to save all the scientists on the map before the invasion is completed. To archive this objective you must keep out the aliens from the rescue.

Emboldened by these signs, students and intellectuals in Budapest, the Hungarian capital, organize a protest of previously unseen magnitudes. As the communist leadership sweeps in to kill the movement in its tracks a violent response is provoked, thus sparking the Revolution of the 23rd of October.<br/><br/>One player takes charge of the Soviet forces trying to shape the headlines to his liking and uses the militia and snipers of the State Protection Authority to stop the revolutionaries at all cost. The other player(s) (from 1-3 opponents) co-operatively play as the ringleaders of the revolutionary forces collecting resources (represented as icons on their cards) and recruiting other fighters to ensure the revolution's events end up in favor of their side, while fighting off tanks and soldiers in this exciting, historically inspired card driven game.<br/><br/>Days of Ire: Budapest 1956 is played over seven days &mdash; the last week of October 1956. The Soviet commander plays headline cards at the beginning of every turn, gathering Command Points and triggering effects that sometimes help, sometimes hinder the revolutionary effort. This card-play, reminiscent of well-known card-driven wargames (CDG) such as Twilight Struggle or Labyrinth: War on Terror, is what drives the tempo and the strategic thrust of the game. The other player(s) form the revolutionary side. They collect cards and fighters for two reasons: to resolve events for boosts to their side, and to fight off militia, snipers, and Soviet tanks in a drastic fight for survival. They have to manage their positions while spreading across Budapest, carefully dividing their actions as a team and always keeping an eye on their morale lest they run out of cards. This team-playing aspect &mdash; reminiscent of highly successful cooperative games such as Pandemic &mdash; guarantees ease of access to players who would otherwise be more intimidated by a traditional CDG.<br/><br/>If any of the revolutionary ringleaders suffer too many wounds, or if they fail to resolve enough events by the end of the game, history changes and the revolution falls. But if they keep the streets of Budapest free from oppression, the revolution lives on, to fight another day.<br/><br/>Historical Note: In real life, the revolution succeeded, and Hungary was free for less than a week.

Reo introduces a set of community dice used by all players to change the dynamic and allow customization of luck versus skill.<br/><br/>In all variants, players begin with five 8-sided dice each and a cup to keep their roll hidden from the other players. Players then take turns bidding according to the rules, until one player's bid is challenged.  The key to the game is using the results of your roll, probability, and your ability to read others to figure out what the best possible bid for that round is (the most number of dice with the highest number on them), and bid it first.  Challenges are resolved by revealing all the dice, as well as the community roll of 3 additional 8-sided dice that Reo adds.<br/><br/>The most popular version rolls the community dice after a bid is challenged.  This version emphasizes luck a little more, as a player can roll themselves out of a bid gone wrong jam.

Those games are Paulus' 6th Army and Zitadelle: Duel for Kursk 1943.<br/><br/>Paulus' 6th Army is an operational level simulation of the Soviet encirclement operation named &quot;Operation Uranus&quot; and the German escape attempt from Stalingrad from 19th November to 24th December, 1942. This game represents the first significant operational victory of the previously inferior Soviet Red Army over the Wehrmacht. For this reason, the battle of Stalingrad in often referred to as the &quot;turning point&quot; of World War II. But in this game, the German player has more command options than Friedrich Paulus, the German 6th Army commander. So the German player may withdraw from Stalingrad his troops or may defend more effectively than in the historical static situation.<br/><br/>Zitadelle: Duel for Kursk 1943 is an operational level simulation of the greatest tank battle in history. Beginning on July 5th 1943, strong German forces attempted to cut off the Soviet Kursk salient. Hitler had decided to delay the attack however, until he had sufficient new Panther and Tiger tanks available. During that time, the Soviet forces were reinforced on a scale not seen since World War I, and in addition they knew the details of the German offensive plan.

Through the rails of several Railways Companies were transported an important portion of the State&acute;s wealth. Many of these goods were transported to the major cities of S&atilde;o Paulo, cities from other States and others ended up down the hill and delivered to the ships from Santos Port, from where they journeyed to remote places. Amongst the carriage of this wealth also traveled over the rails passengers wagons, at a time when distances were tricky to overcome by steam locomotives which slowly crossed valleys and plains. <br/>From a broader view, it is possible to state 8 companies excelled in this endeavor:  Cia. Sorocabana de Estradas de Ferro, Cia. Paulista de Estradas de Ferro, Cia. Mogiana de Estradas de Ferro, Estrada de Ferro Araraquara, S&atilde;o Paulo Railway, Estrada de Ferro Noroeste do Brasil, Estrada de Ferro S&atilde;o Paulo-Minas and Estrada de Ferro S&atilde;o Paulo-Rio. Each of these railway companies had their own height but, after the Government&rsquo;s decision to prioritize the road transport, they decayed over time. Nowadays, little remains from many of them but stations, warehouses and rails hidden by the tall grass and oblivion. They were vandalized, destroyed and gone leaving no sign of the passengers, products, wealth and history. Sad closure of a rich and beautiful story.<br/><br/>Ferrovias de S&atilde;o Paulo brings all railways companies in full operation, where products have to be transported through the cities or sent to Santos Port to meet the needs from other destinations. Players have to move their train compositions, buy and sell products, transport them to several railways of S&atilde;o Paulo State while negotiate with other players through their &ldquo;Agent&rdquo;. The market constantly changes the value of the products so players will have to prove their abilities to explore the best time to buy and sell goods. Additionally, players&rsquo; &ldquo;Agents&rdquo; will have to negotiate with other players &ldquo;Agents&rdquo;, as well with the &ldquo;Negotiator&rdquo;, an independent agent controlled by all players. <br/>Each player start with 1 train composition represented by 1 Locomotive and 1 Train Wagon. Throughout the game, players will be able to improve both their locomotives and train wagons to become more efficient and acquire other train compositions. Finally, players can also buy shares from several Railways Companies, shares from Mining Companies (essential for the Coal Market) and shares from Telegraph Company. <br/>Ferrovias de S&atilde;o Paulo is an economic game where the most successful player claims the victory by holding the biggest amount of money. More than a game, history will come to life as players revive the time where people and history were transported in old wooden train wagons, pulled by steam locomotives which insisted on meeting the challenges of S&atilde;o Paulo territory.<br/><br/>We wish you all a safe journey.<br/><br/>"}, "192848": {"rpgartist": ["Tyler Clark", "Rick Hershey", "Jason Juta", "Marko Radulovic", "Phillip Simpson", "Colby Stevenson"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "The Lost Library of Thoth (Pathfinder)", "rpgdesigner": ["Jason Nelson", "Alex Riggs"], "rpgproducer": ["Rick Hershey", "Jason Nelson"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2864874.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpgissuearticle": ["Reviews"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Legendary Games"], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Egyptian Adventure Path Plug-Ins"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2864874_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Knowledge is the Greatest Treasure! <br/><br/>While some raiders of the ruins of ancient lands lust for gold and glory, the wise seek knowledge and the lore of the fallen empires.

Recruit the best ninja and samurai warriors to conquer the dead Daimyo's palace and seize the treasure.<br/><br/>Deck building full of interaction<br/>Choose a Hero, then build your deck from over 60 different cards to fulfill your Hero's specific conditions called Loot Conditions. When Loot Conditions are fulfilled, you can take a treasure card, which grants you endgame points and powerful effects.<br/>At the same time, slow down the other players by blocking their cards and knoking down their heroes through duels.<br/><br/>Ninja or Samurai<br/>In Daimyo&rsquo;s Fall, every card has a class: ninja or samurai, with their own characteristics and weak points. Each of them has specific bonuses and skills, and only by mastering all of them you will dominate the battlefield.

Daimyo's Fall is developed focusing on interaction and strategy! Experience a competitive, asymmetrical deck-building game developed by veteran players. <br/>- High skill cap. Before mastering all the game's possibilities you're going to play more than a few games.<br/>- Change your victory conditions: You can buy more Heroes or change the Hero you started with during the game to have more Loot Conditions. Part of the strategy is to change your Loot Conditions adapting them to the flow of the game and looting more treasures!<br/>- &quot;Sale/return&quot; system: each card has a &quot;sale&quot; value and/or a &quot;return&quot; effect you can activate by sending your cards back to the Domain.<br/>- A colorful art style will introduce you to a story of betrayal, liberation, and hope set in the Sengoku period. Enjoy a deep backstory with more than 40 different characters, each with unique personalities, backgrounds, and motivations.

Impress the Pharaoh by digging your mighty paws into the sand. Build majestic Shrines, Sun Temples and Obelisks!

It mingles multiple mechanisms, including civilization-building (with tile placement and network building), bidding, set collection, area control, and hand management (with players required to exchange all used cards with their opponent at the end of each round). Seven separate player abilities re-combine each round, depending on the favor of the gods earned that round by each player. For example, earning the favor of the god Ra lets you add a Player Disc to the current Sun for area control around the edges of the board. Ptah allows you to claim the current Monument Card for set collection scoring. Seshat lets you place the current Monument Standee on the board to add to the network of Monuments in play. Geb and Nut let you claim and rotate this Monument Standee and aim it at other Monuments to score points. The Pharaoh lets you secretly contribute cards to the construction of the Pyramid, awarding the greater contributor many points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Over a series of eight rounds, players work to build a Pyramid and a series of smaller monuments to impress the Pharaoh. By performing actions unique to each god, players build monuments and align them to point at other monuments, gaining influence over the Pharaoh as they do so.

The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary has a template for liches, but it isn&rsquo;t designed with players in mind, and so many GMs are forced to tackle questions like: what do I need to do to become a lich? Is a CR +2 adjustment the same as two levels? Does that mean I have to skip leveling up and &ldquo;save up&rdquo; an extra level, or do I have to lose levels to become a lich? Even if the GM has the answer to all of these questions, he or she may be hesitant to allow players to take a template that lets them heal themselves infinitely, and which can permanently paralyze foes all day long, and while these abilities are powerful, they&rsquo;re not very fun at the table.<br/><br/>This book presents the lich master prestige class, a ten level prestige class that not only makes being a lich more accessible, by presenting it in prestige class form, but also provides abilities that are more player oriented. Far more than just divvying up the abilities in the template, this prestige class greatly expands the idea of what a lich can do, and makes liches more customizable. Not only do lich masters gain phylacteries, potent defenses, and deliver negative energy with a touch, they can also channel negative energy or project their soul into other creatures, easily control undead minions, sever the souls of his victims from their bodies and use them for his own dark ends, and far more. Finally, the book includes five feats intended for members of the class, which allows players to even further customize their lich.<br/><br/>Whether you are a player who&rsquo;s always dreamed of playing a lich, or a GM who wants a way to make a lich character more exciting and dynamic, this book brings these undead spellcasters to unlife in a whole new way.<br/><br/>"}, "192913": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Erik von Rossing"], "poll": [], "name": "THE UNION ABLAZE: A Solitaire Game of the American Civil War (1861-1865).", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Dice Rolling", "Point to Point Movement"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "1", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2875551_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Berserker Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2875551.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["American Civil War", "Civil War", "Print & Play"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "BACKGROUND: THE UNION ABLAZE is semi-historical game of the American Civil War (1861-1865) in the East, also, referred to as the Peninsula.

The Confederates are now building up their forces and gathering their Naval Squadrons to kick the Union out of the Southern States. The Union must build their Army and Naval Forces and capture Richmond and Petersburg along with enough key Confederate Settlements before the Confederates capture a number of key Union Settlements to force the Confederates to capitulate.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE: As the Commander of the Union Naval and Land Forces, you must gather your forces and naval squadrons to capture the Key Victory Point (VP) Confederate Settlements of Richmond and Petersburg (total of 9 VP), along with a number of other Key Confederate Settlements who&rsquo;s VP Values total 26 or more (for a grand total of 35 VP or more) before the Treaty of Appomattox Event Card is Drawn. If the Confederates control a number of Union Settlements worth 20VP or more, the Confederates win. Also, if the &ldquo;Treaty of Appomattox&rdquo; Card has been played and the Union does not control Richmond, Petersburg and an additional 26VP worth of Confederate Settlements, the Confederates win.<br/><br/>FEATURES: THE UNION ABLAZE features many colorful game counters, player aids and campaign cards. Units include Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery, Gatling Guns, Zouave Infantry, and Sharpshooters.

Once a peaceful settlement of hopeful pilgrims looking to green the desert, the city was disastrously buried by the desert sands and eventually became a destination for all sorts of neer-do-wells looking to escape the eyes of the authorities - and to set up a little empire of their own. In City of Outcasts players are looking to secure the support of the various characters and factions in the city and build up enough support to reclaim Rym for its down-trodden people. In the micro game tradition of games like Love Letter, but with a little more going on, City of Outcasts looks to provide players with a quick, but in-depth micro game experience.<br/><br/>OVERALL GAMEPLAY: Each player is attempting to play the various powers off each other to assemble allies in a cunning bid to take control of Rym, the City of Outcasts. There are 13 ally cards in the game as well as an Eyes of the People card. One card is dealt to each player face down at the beginning of the game and an equal number of cards are dealt face up on the table as there are players plus one. Each ally cards has an influence number, special ability and a point value. Each player will draw one card from the table clockwise until each player has 2 cards in hand with 1 card remaining. The ally card on the table is the character players are trying to influence. Each player will then simultaneously choose a card from their hand and place it on the table face down. Going clockwise, cards are revealed and if there is an ability with a choice, it must be made upon the reveal. Whoever has the highest revealed influence number after all cards are revealed wins the face up card for the points on the card and takes the Eye of the People card. The Eyes of the People is for the start player of the next round as well as a bonus point at the end of the game. The game ends when there are not enough cards to place on the table and the player with the most points wins and more importantly, usher in a period of justice, peace and prosperity for its down-trodden people.<br/><br/>There is also included in the game 9 Location Cards and 16 Identity Tokens that can be used for a more epic version of the game. Players assign allies that they have influenced to locations for dominance in Rym. These cards have location points which are used to determine who has the most control within the city. Three location cards are used for each game and the winner is determined after 3 games.<br/><br/>"}, "192957": {"rpgartist": ["Alex Alexandrov", "Hardy Fowler", "Christophe Madura"], "statistics": [], "name": "Wyrd Chronicles (Issue 12 - Jun 2014)", "rpgdesigner": ["Justin Gibbs", "Michael Kelmelis", "Mack Martin", "Amanda McGee", "Mark E.

Hockey players are rated individually on such traits as goal scoring, passing, defense, checking, and several others.  Goalies are also rated on their abilities to make saves, avoid giving up rebounds and more.  Game players will resolve action either by printing out fast action cards or using the Microsoft Excel Game Center, which is included in the game.  All player cards, the fast action deck and more are available as PDF downloads.<br/><br/>The game flows similar to an actual hockey game and is broken up into the three main zones of a rink:  Offensive Zone, Neutral Zone and Defensive Zone.  You can either pass or skate your way from one zone to the next and the fast action cards (or Game Center) will determine the result.  Once your player makes it to the offensive zone, then you decide to shoot or pass again.<br/><br/>The hockey players&rsquo; ability to draw and dish out penalties is also very evident in the game.

Hawaii is a place to relax, drink lots of cocktails, and do nothing all day &mdash; except, of course, if you're a dictator. So what are dictators doing during their holidays? The same thing they do every day: Trying to take over the world! And what is a better place to start then that pesky &quot;Ol' Murica&quot;?<br/><br/>Revenge of the Dictators is a way too competitive board game for 2-5 players. For the course of the game (yes, only during the game) each player becomes a vicious self-loving dictator. The ultimate goal of the game is easy: race across the map of North America, confront the President, take over the USA, and by doing so gain absolute control of America's forces and therefore the world! The only thing the dictators have to do to avoid eminent repercussions is disarm some nuclear facilities in order to remove the nuclear threat targeting their home countries. Sounds simple, right? The only thing is that dictators aren't used to working together &mdash; and in the end there can be only one Grandmaster &Uuml;ber Dictator of the world!<br/><br/>In more detail, each player receives a dictator passport with a special ability unique to that dictator. The board shows a map of North America and is divided into four &quot;Nuclear Zones&quot;; each zone consists of several states, of which some include a nuclear facility. Every player receives a unique nuclear facility card for each nuclear zone.<br/><br/>The game is divided into turns, and each turn consists of any possible combination of the following three actions: draw a Command card, play a Command card and Travel (maximum of once per turn). Players start in Hawaii and race across the map towards the White House in Washington DC. During the game, players can disarm any number of the nuclear facilities they received by rolling a die.

Legendary Rogues revisits the core class abilities of the Pathfinder rogue in both its core and unchained version, exploring its offensive and defensive capabilities as well as its versatility with skills (including unchained skill unlocks) and rogue talents, giving not only new mechanics but also alternate rules and advice on implementation. The rogue's arsenal is further enhanced with a collection of feats to enliven and expand the rogue's capabilities. Legendary Rogues lives up to its name by offering an entirely new version of the rogue class, the Legendary Rogue, including an array of archetypes specifically tailored for it. Finally, we reach back to the roots of the rogue class with a brand-new prestige class, the Master Thief, a lord of larceny that will leave heroes and villains alike clutching their purses and hiding their hoards!

Strategy being the art of positioning ones formations. Tactics being the art of how they fight. At first, the creator of this game increased the number of pieces and the size of the battlefield.  The quick realization is that chess evolved into, and solidified, into a board 8 squares by 8 squares for good reason. The two small armies are therein locked into combat where every position counts.  Increase the size of the field or the army, and all that is lost.<br/><br/>Then came the epiphany: move multiple pieces in formations rather than just one piece at a time. Formations that are governed by rules.  Formations that can be broken apart.  No point system is necessary. If a formation breaks up or loses pieces through attrition, it simply becomes less effective as a fighting unit until it is either annihilated or becomes too small to remain relevant to the battle.<br/><br/>It then became a matter of experimenting with the numbers of pieces and size of the board to create a balance whereby every formation plays an important role in any given game.<br/><br/>In the Napoleonic Wars, well formed infantries defeated the cavalry charge because horses refused to charge into a wall of bayonets held by foot soldiers that no longer turned to run. But the same densely packed infantry made an easy target for an artillery strike. The artillery, in turn, was itself  vulnerable to a cavalry charge. This historic dynamic of rock-paper-scissors underpins the balance of Regimental Chess.<br/><br/>The king is most often captured by a formation of rooks and queens, acting like a heavy artillery.  However, this group has a difficult time capturing the king if he is surrounded by his horses. Because of the way they are formed and move, the horses are extremely vulnerable to charge of densely packed infantry. This infantry, in turn, can be quickly wiped out by the rooks and queens.  It is all a matter of how many pieces are in each formation, how the formation is shaped and where it stands in relation to its enemies. For this reason, an immediate strike by bishops, albeit sacrificial, is best intended to wipe out as many rooks, queens and horses as possible, break up their formations and thus reduce the opponent&rsquo;s offensive and defensive capabilities.<br/><br/>Multiple Board Regimental Chess emulates the battle a general must wage along a broad front, with multiple divisions and commands, each carrying out and issuing orders. Each division protects the flank of the next division. Forces must shift along the backfield to defend against points of attack, or to mass forces and attack where opportunity presents itself.<br/><br/>After all is said and done, we&rsquo;re extremely pleased with the game we&rsquo;ve created and we hope you enjoy it as much.<br/><br/>If your intellect has a brutal streak, or your brutality has an intelligent edge, this is the game for you.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "192997": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Nicholas Fortugno"], "poll": [], "name": "Killer Snails: Assassins of the Sea", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Deck / Pool Building"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "16", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2934101_t.jpg", "average": "7.14687", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Killer Snails"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2934101.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Educational"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Killer Snails: Assassins of the Sea is a deck-building game in which the players are scientists collecting predatory cone snails that prey on fish, worms and other mollusks.
