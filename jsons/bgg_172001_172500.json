Slowly the Others have creeped into our lives, corrupting society from within. The city of Haven is the key to their invasion, but it will not go down without a fight, thanks to the actions of the paranormal organization known as F.A.I.T.H. (Federal Authority for the Interdiction of Transdimensional Horrors). Each session of The Others is played with one player controlling the forces of a single Sin, against the other players who control a team of 7 FAITH heroes. The heroes cooperate to survive the Sin's attacks and accomplish the missions set before them, while the Sin attempts to thwart the heroes in all ways (preferably by destroying them).<br/><br/>The heroes are divided into different classes, each specialized in a different aspect of the game. Leaders are good at helping the other members of the team. Bruisers are excellent melee fighters. Snipers are experts at using guns to put down monsters from a distance. And Fixers have the resourcefulness and knowledge of the occult necessary to resolve supernatural crises that spread through the city. Each hero also has their own stats and unique abilities that set them apart from all others. Knowing when to bring in the right reinforcement can be key to FAITH&rsquo;s victory.<br/><br/>Corruption is one of the main mechanics of the game. It is both a way for the Sin to consume heroes, and a way for heroes to accomplish amazing feats they wouldn&rsquo;t be capable of normally. Taking corruption grants heroes powerful bonuses (as long as they keep taking corruption), but when they become fully corrupted, their darkest secrets may come back to haunt them and tear the team from within, or their flesh might simply succumb to the sinful influences.<br/><br/>The Sins player, on the other hand, has access to the different monsters of each Sin, including Abominations, a Controller, and the terrifying Avatar of Sin! These monsters can attempt to destroy the heroes, or simply hinder their progress on their missions. Each Sin provides the Sins Player with a different deck of Sins cards that can be played at different times to surprise players with different effects, often tied to the strategy of each Sin. Yes, because each Sin taints the game with an overarching mechanic that is always in effect. For example, Pride punishes prideful heroes that venture into the streets on their own, while Sloth punishes heroes who try to move quickly across the board. Heroes will need to learn to deal with the different influence of each Sin, which will always stand between them and their mission.<br/><br/>The Sins are also aided by Acolytes, with each session using a different type. These lowly corrupted servants of darkness can fight and stand in the way of heroes, but they also have a once per round special ability that reflects their previous lives. For example, corrupted hobos take equipment from heroes, corrupted nuns corrupt the city districts, and corrupted doctors keep heroes from healing.<br/><br/>There are 7 different stories that players can embark on for each session of The Others. Each of them brings different special rules, different dynamics, and a unique system of branching missions the heroes need to accomplish in order to be victorious. There are Terror stories, which are more straightforward, focusing on action and combat; Corruption stories revolve around the Corruption spreading through the city and the heroes themselves; and Redemption stories rely on saving the city and the few innocents that remain. Each story can be played on a different map setup, which further makes the dynamic of each session unique.<br/><br/>The board used in The Others is made up of several tiles, each depicting a different city district and different configurations of streets. As the city of Haven still belongs to humanity, and it&rsquo;s the Sins that are attempting to take it over, the heroes can use it to get different benefits each district offers them. For example, they can go to the hospital to heal wounds, to the museum to get rid of corruption, to the RavenCorp tower to get new equipment, or to the police station to call in an orbital strike. What districts are available on each map, and their location, can greatly change the dynamic of the game.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, and depending on how badly the heroes fare against storyline plot twists and developments, the Apocalypse Track will advance, making the Sins gradually stronger and more terrifying. Apocalypse cards, tied to the type of story being played (Terror, Corruption, or Redemption) introduce new twists and challenges to the game, even bringing in the members of the Hell Club themselves!<br/><br/>Heroes will die. Either in noble sacrifice, torn apart by claws and tentacles, or consumed by the corruption welling up in their souls. The question is whether the FAITH team will manage to fulfill their final mission in time, or whether the Sins will reign supreme over humanity.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"264330": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.6943", "name": "The Others", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "1609", "boardgameaccessory": {"213832": "The Others: Corruption Pack"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"5496": "Thematic Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"25158": "Components: Miniatures"}}, "172049": {"statistics": {}, "name": "SoulCraft II: League of Angels", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"264333": "Android edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2393520.png", "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2339": "Action RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"6063": "Android"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2393520_t.png", "description": "SoulCraft 2 is the successor of the Action RPG SoulCraft and brings the all new League of Angels to the game.

The Command and Control Enhancement provides Company sized replacement units for the Germans and the representation of communications between HQ (the concept of Radio Line of Sight is used) and the HQ ability to respond on its own initiative when commo is bad.  The Fire Support Enhancement provides for artillery unit missions of Direct Support, General Support, and Reinforcing fires.  This helps to restrict the fire of artillery in the game to something more like what happens in real life.  Artillery cannot be gathered from around the map to support attacks or defense engagements.  It must be planned.<br/>Both of the previous 2 games start the battle from 9 July.

Rosenthal shopped the game to various manufacturers, demanding an unheard-of 50% split of the profits. Only Cinematronics was willing to take him up on the offer.<br/><br/>Two players controlled different ships. One button rotated the ship left, another rotated the ship right, one engaged thrust, one fired a shell, and one entered hyperspace (which causes the ship to disappear and reappear elsewhere on the playfield at random).<br/><br/>The game offered a number of gameplay options, including the presence or absence of a star in the middle of the playfield (which exerted a positive or negative gravitational pull), whether the edges of the playfield &quot;wrapped around&quot; to their opposite sides, and whether shells bounced. Three other fascinating features were unique to this game. First, the game could not be played in &quot;one player&quot; mode; a human opponent was required. Second, the player's ship could take a glancing hit without dying, but would suffer damage; a cloud of loose ship fragments would break off and float away, after which the ship would be visibly damaged on screen and would turn and accelerate more slowly. Third and most memorable was that the duration of play for any contest was solely governed by the amount of money deposited; each quarter bought a minute and a half of play. A dollar bought six minutes, and for a ten dollar roll of quarters two players could play non-stop for an hour.<br/><br/>Space Wars formed the basis of the platform used by Cinematronics into the early '80s.

By doing so, a long small cave is created on which different dangerous objects or animals (vampiric bat, giant centipedes, laser beams, etc) are shown. During movement the bat-planes fly either along the cave ceiling or along the cave floor until they arrive at a cave and have to encounter its horrors. The dice-fight that follows during an encounter can be won (experience points are gained) or lost, depending on the strength and equipment of the bat-plane. Players can strengthen their bat-planes by upgrading various parts of their plane (shields, short-range attack, plate armor, power, maneuverability and navigation &amp; control), however only at specific locations in the cave. Players can not only invest their money in upgrades, they can also decide to buy long-range missiles or booster fuel. The long-range missiles can be used to shoot rivals, caves and obstructions. Booster fuel is used to outmaneuver other players by playing an extra turn or to move diagonally. Some cave locations also offer the possibility to explore the local environment, and with a bit of luck player's  might find special upgrades there.<br/><br/>Each game, the layout, the length and the difficulty of the cave is different. It is a tactical game, thrilling to the last turn, based on a few simple rules, in a steampunk sci-fi technological world, where players have to continually cope with limited resources.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"357559": "Kickstarter edition"}, "maxplaytime": "100", "average": "7.41176", "name": "Cave Pilot 55", "playingtime": "100", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "17", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "172119": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2386130.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"199830": {"name": "\u9ab8\u9aa8\u738bVS\u30dc\u30c9\u30b2\u63a2\u5075 (Skeleton King vs Boardgame Detective)"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"80081": {"name": "\u6c5f\u795e \u53f7 (Go Ejin)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"80081": "\u6c5f\u795e \u53f7 (Go Ejin)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"29063": {"name": "Ejin \u7814\u7a76\u6240 (Ejin Kenkyuujyo)"}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2386130_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "description": "User Summary:<br/>Among a group of detectives there is the perpetrator of a murder.<br/><br/>The culprit is one of the players, and the other players become detectives.

The homeless I wipe to keep rumors of your apparitions from spreading. All those Foundation members during Harada&rsquo;s mind squall. Ax earlier today&hellip;&rdquo;<br/><br/>One of you says, &ldquo;Y&rsquo;know, if I was Peter I&rsquo;d simply anchor an invisibility shield to Monica Jim. Every time she leaves the Renegades&rsquo; underground lair, Peter&rsquo;s psionic energy spikes on. That keeps Monica Jim hidden while alerting Peter to potential trouble while she&rsquo;s out. But this also gives her some leash so the kid doesn&rsquo;t go stir crazy.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Another one of you says, &ldquo;Nah, nothing in any of the comics says Peter can anchor his powers, much less have them kick off subconsciously like that. That&rsquo;s going too far.&rdquo;<br/><br/>And another friend pipes up and says, &ldquo;Yeah, I agree. Not to mention that doesn&rsquo;t solve Peter&rsquo;s problem of the psychic weight he&rsquo;s carrying. If I was Peter, I would&rsquo;ve figured out how Harada&rsquo;s mind squall worked while it was scrambling all that brain juice. The comics have shown how fast he adapts, after all. Then, when he&rsquo;s scanning and erasing memories, he generates, well, let&rsquo;s call it a &lsquo;mind bubble.&rsquo; A subtle pressure of memories spread into a wide area&mdash;a pressure valve relief sorta thing. Kicks off d&eacute;j&agrave; vu for anyone in a certain radius.

It&rsquo;s all up to as you carve out a strategic path to victory in this remarkable world of heroes, villains, and awe-inspiring spaceships.<br/><br/>The first player to score 15 victory points or be the last undestroyed ship wins.<br/><br/>Players score points by reaching planets, winning duels, and performing actions using their available crew members (skilled in Exploration, Alien Technology, Medicine, Psychology, Repair, and Ship Upgrades).

In the Papal States, Pope Paul III knew he could rely on the strength of the powerful Orsini family to oppose the power of his enemies. In 1542 Pierfrancesco II Orsini, called Vicino, inherited the fief of Bomarzo, which elected to his residence, along with the fiefs of Collepiccolo, Castelvecchio, Montenero and Mompeo. In 1547 Vicino Orsini wanted to celebrate the grandeur of his family, by commissioning one of the greatest architectural wonders of Italy. Within a natural amphitheater were masterfully carved huge mythological figures, whose sublime beauty enchants and terrifies those who are in their presence. Even today the park is shrouded in mystery: is it a Sacred Grove in which to bring votive offerings to the gods or a Park of Monsters made to scare poor people? It's rumored that Vicino Orsini owed his own fortune to the devotion shown to the gods and to the offers that he brought to them.<br/><br/>In Bomarzo, you will have to delve into the mystery of the park, to propitiate the gods and obtain their favor. You&rsquo;ll play the role of one of the feudal lords of the Orsini and you&rsquo;ll manage one of four minor feuds, Collepiccolo, Castelvecchio, Montenero or Mompeo, trying to earn the esteem of your lord. If you&rsquo;ll develop your feud in the best way you will manage to prevail over your rivals. Do not forget the supernatural forces that dwell in Bomarzo: your existence and your achievement will be influenced by how you manage to turn in your advantage the will of the monsters of the park.<br/><br/>Bomarzo is a game of deep strategy for 2-4 players, the short duration of which gives to the players' choices even more decisive importance. The careful management of resources will allow you to easily take advantage of the power of the monstrous deity of the park. Each turn you will be able to perform various operations in your fief and also you will have to choose which god ingratiate, through workers placement bound by auction. But beware: each divinity of the park requires a very specific offer to concede his favor otherwise unleash his monstrous fury on unwary visitors! To triumph in Bomarzo you not only need the best development but mostly to have tied your for-tunes to the most powerful and prestigious deity.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"264614": "Multilingual first edition"}, "average": "6.67208", "name": "Bomarzo", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "152", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"11515": "Country: Italy"}}, "172207": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2394299.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"24304": "Unspeakable Words"}, "is_expanded_by": {"199021": {"name": "Unspeakable Words: \"K is for Exploding Kithulhu\" Promo Card"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"61": {"name": "James Ernest"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": {"6815": "John Kovalic"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"244": {"name": "Playroom Entertainment"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2394299_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Unspeakable Words is the Call of Cthulhu Word Game designed by James Ernest and Mike Selinker. In the game, you and your opponents will attempt to form words from the letter cards in your hand. Each letter is worth points &ndash; the amount of points is determined by the number of angles in the letter (where the hounds of Tindalos are lurking!). You may try to make the highest scoring word possible, but&hellip; you&rsquo;ll have to test the strength of the word against a roll of the 20-sided die. Roll equal to or higher than the value of your word and you&rsquo;re safe&hellip; but roll less than the value of your word and you lose a precious piece of your sanity, represented by an adorable Cthulhu pawn!<br/><br/>Each letter is uniquely illustrated with a horrifying character from the works of H.P. Lovecraft, which adds to the dark whimsy of the game.<br/><br/>Since its release in 2007, Unspeakable Words has been received with great reviews. It was Games Magazine's Word Game of the Year and the Best Party Board Game at BoardGameGeek's Golden Geek Awards.  In 2008, a second edition of Unspeakable Words was released, this time with purple pawns. Because of the flexibility of the game, a second deck and second set of pawns can be added for twice as many players.<br/><br/>Since the inception of Unspeakable Words, Playroom Entertainment has wanted to release more specialized editions. With this Kickstarter, supporters can upgrade the Unspeakable Words game with special multi-colored pawns (five pawns each of eight colors to play up to eight players!), a dice/pawn bag and additional cards!

While most of the villagers who live there are relatively average folk, Norlynn is home to the arcane order known as the Magicker's Guild, and, more importantly, the ancient building known to most simply as the House of Doors.<br/><br/>Norlynn is an epic fantasy location for the Entropic Gaming System. Designed as a town to be set within any setting or campaign, it&rsquo;s usable at any character rank and can even provide a new home for the player characters. With a slight change of flavor, Norlynn can also be placed in any dark fantasy setting.<br/><br/>Norlynn includes:<br/><br/>    A collection of NPCs.<br/>    2 new Talents.<br/>    A city with map and important places.<br/>    Adventure hooks.<br/>    &hellip; and more!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Norlynn is a complete, standalone location.

How many headbands were worn? Or how many weapons were pointing to the left? Was the second Indian from the right painted with war paint? Or is there an Indian wearing a shirt, and carrying a tomahawk? The player who is able to give the first correct answer, gains a token.<br/><br/>The 10 playing cards in Kiqsuyapi are double-sided. They determine the level of difficulty of the game. With only 4 cards, the challenge is still moderate. With 10 cards even true champions are going to work up a sweat. And if you still consider this too easy, the expert version will be an even greater challenge for you. Here, all players have to answer and the right answer will gain you a point, as before. Wrong answers, however, will cost you points! This applies in particular to those questions that ask for two or even three aspects at once.

A nest of intrigue and Lord of the Flies-style power struggles, it&rsquo;s far from a safe haven. But it&rsquo;s the only home you know, and just maybe the cradle of a new civilization.

It's treacherous surroundings offer endless chances to take on daring quests and slay fearsome monsters.Of course slaying monsters requires quality gear, and you won't just find it laying around. But no worries, there are always tasks to be done to earn some coin; such as helping the blacksmith forge some tools, or helping the Inn Keeper fix up the place. While the Enclave has always been known as a &quot;safe haven&quot; from the terrors that surround it, recently it's fortification has been tested due to a Dragon that has made home near by. Although adventurers do come through often, not many are brave enough to go toe to toe with a dragon. That's where you come in! It's about time someone stood up to that gigantic, fire-breathing, armor-like-scale covered, razor fanged, flying pest. No true Hero wants to share that glorious triumph, so your on your own. It's time to forge your legacy!<br/><br/>Gameplay Description:<br/><br/>Each player stars the game by choosing a Hero. There are 4 races to choose from, Human, Elf, Dwarf, and Orc. Each has a unique starting deck of skill cards and 1 unique trait card. The skills are Strength, Dexterity, and Focus. These will be the power behind your actions. Each side of the main deck has 4 revealed cards. One side represents outside the Enclave, the other represents inside it. You will use the cards in your hand drawn from your deck to interact with the revealed cards. This includes slaying a monster, completing a task, or buying gear. Your actions reward experience in the form of skill cards. These are collected and then added to your deck once you level up. You can either buy bigger and badder gear, or upgrade what you have. You can also spend all of the cards in your hand to gain a new talent card which is added to your deck. Once you feel your ready to go, you can face off with the Dragon. Defeat it, and you've not only won the game, but also forged your name in glory for all of eternity! Or at least until an expansion comes out with a bigger dragon....<br/><br/>What makes it Unique:<br/><br/>Experience: Unlike other deck-building games, you don't &quot;buy&quot; cards from the main pool and add them into your deck. Instead you complete tasks and defeat monsters to earn &quot;experience&quot; in the form of skill cards. Those are what get's added to your deck. How does more of the same card help you? Most importantly, adding MORE of these cards allows you to level up your character. This also gives you a chance to really fine-tune your character. If you want to wield a sword, you'll need strength behind it, and so completing Strength tasks earns you more Strength cards. The more Strength cards in your deck, the more often you will draw them. Also, the more cards in your deck, the more turns you can take before you need to rest (recycling your discard pile for your deck). There are also trait cards such as Relentless, Fearsome, Agile, and Clever. Each of these provides a different effect when played. At the end of the game, you've built a truly unique Hero with a unique deck of cards to power it!<br/><br/>Leveling: Each player only starts with a hand of 3 cards, which is then increased by leveling up your Hero. The larger hand size gives the player more potential power behind their actions, which is not only required to defeat the Dragon, but feels very rewarding.<br/><br/>Theme implementation: The tasks in the game are simple labor jobs but the skills required to complete them are intuitive and logical. For example, the Blacksmiths' task requires Strength to forge ingots while the Alchemist' task of preparing potions requires Focus. This helps eliminate that disconnect many deck-building games have.<br/><br/>These are just some of the many unique mechanics that make The Enclave a deck-building game that we feel truly stands out among the rest!<br/><br/>The game is set to release at the end of April, 2015.<br/><br/>"}, "172305": {"boardgamedesigner": {"272": {"name": "J\u00fcrgen P.

You take on the role of a clan leader and explore the landscape, discover new tools and offer to holy places. All this to gather as much status as possible.<br/><br/>Epoch: Early Inventors is very thematic and tries to stay as close to reality as possible.<br/><br/>Before starting the game you build a landscape of hexagonal playing cards and holy places.<br/><br/>In your turn you can carry out 1 action and/or develop 1 card and/or offer to 1 holy place.<br/><br/>You can choose between the following actions: gather food, fish (for food), hunt for deer, butcher deer, explore adjacent cards or work to get raw material.<br/><br/>You need food to move around the game board and develop cards. Gathering food and fishing are basically the same actions, but depending on the tools you have, the one action might give you more food than the other.<br/><br/>You need raw materials to develop cards and offer to the holy places. Sometimes raw materials can help you to heighten the proceeds of actions. The action &quot;Work&quot; can get you raw materials. The type of landscape you are currently standing on determines how much work it is to get hold of a certain raw material. Raw materials used in the game are: wood, flax, stone, flint, clay and iron ore.<br/><br/>Butchering animals can not only get you food, but also skins, bones and tendons.<br/><br/>Exploring cards adds to your status. It also opens up more cards to be developed.<br/><br/>To develop a card, you need to &quot;pay&quot; the food and materials depicted on the card.<br/><br/>Once you have developed a card, you can use the tool, equipment or knowledge of this card to your advantage. E.g. Rope Making allows you to turn 2 flax into 3 ropes. Sowing gives you 2-4 extra food, when gathering food. An axe makes it easier to chop wood.<br/><br/>By cleverly using your own cards and those of your opponents, you try to offer materials to as many holy places as you can, thereby increasing your status even more.<br/><br/>After 14-20 rounds the game is over.

Also, the cards may have arrows in one or more 8-way directions (up, diagonal up-right, right, diagonal down-right...) Each player starts with a 3x3 grid, 10 points of life and a deck of 25-40 cards.

To combine the cards you must put them in the 3x3 grids and achieve to match the arrows (for example, a card in the second row and second column with an up arrow matches with a card with a down arrow that is in the first row and second column). The effect is determined by the greatest symbol value (except neutral, that haves no effect), in case of draw (for example, 2 sword and 2 crosses) the player chooses what effect it should be. Attack effect (sword) deducts 1 point of defence from the life of the opponent for each sword in the combination OR you can disable a card in the rival's 3x3 grid. Defence adds to the player 1 point of life for each shield in the combination. Revitalization can undisable 1 card in your grid.<br/><br/>There are 2 ways to win the game: by reducing the rival's life to 0 OR when the rival have cards in the hand and cannot play a card (the grid is filled with 9 cards that cannot combine in this turn) It should be noted that when a player haves 0 cards in its deck, losses 1 point of life at the start of his turn.<br/><br/>"}, "172341": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Monster Cake", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"264820": "Android edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2337": "Cute Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"6063": "Android"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/>Monster Cake is a game in which you drive a bulldozer around a desert trying to flatten monsters so that your Grandmother can use them as ingredients in her famous Monster Cake.

It is the first board game designed by Vic Davis, owner and operator of Cryptic Comet Games. Vic's previous games have been computer turn based strategy games and have won praise from critics and fans alike for their stimulating board game like mechanics.<br/><br/>Players first select a player card that represents their Assassin each possessing a unique one time use special ability and then assign dice from a pool to 4 attributes: Combat, Stealth, Traps and Lore. The assignments indicate how many dice are rolled for each corresponding challenge type and what face results constitute success when the dice are rolled.<br/><br/>Play then proceeds in rounds where each player takes his turn. 2 and 4 player games last 8 rounds while 3 player games last 9 rounds.<br/><br/>During their turn players can choose 2 of 8 possible actions (some actions can only be chosen once)<br/><br/>1. Visit the Guild Healer (pay gold to remove wound tokens)<br/>2. Draw Guild Stipend (gold) (only once per turn)<br/>3. Buy an Item Card<br/>4. Buy a Spell Card (if you have a skill card that allows this)<br/>5. Visit the Guild Sorcerer (pay gold to charge a spell)<br/>6. Draw 2 Secret Objective Cards (keep 1 or none)(only once per turn)<br/>7. Play a Guild Card for its Guild Event text<br/>8. Attempt a Mission Contract Card (only once per turn)<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to accumulate Influence Points (IP). Influence Points can be gained by either successfully completing Mission Contract cards or buying influence cards at the end of the round during the Influence Bidding Phase where cards are auctioned off to the highest bidder.  Each influence card has an IP value and a unique passive special ability that can help the player out during the game.<br/><br/>Mission Contract cards are at the heart of the game and represent assassination targets that the guild has available for its guild members. Players can play Guild Cards face down before the round begins to the revealed Mission Contract cards on the table in order to help their own or hurt their opponents' chances of accomplishing the mission. Missions vary from level 1 to 5 and offer an array of rewards from Influence Points to gold and additional ability die. However, the greater the rewards, the higher the risk that your assassin will be wounded or fail the mission. Take too many wound tokens and you are out of the game.<br/><br/>Each mission is composed of a chain of challenges corresponding to the 4 ability types on the player cards i.e. combat, stealth, etc.. Players determine the level of the challenge (number of successes needed) from the contract card and then select a challenge card from the top 3 revealed cards of the Challenge Deck.  The challenge card indicates the type of challenge and the pass/fail rules.  Players roll the appropriate number of dice, use Guild Cards, Item Cards, Skill Cards, Spell Cards and fate tokens (rerolls) to modify the results and hopefully win the challenge. Players can press their luck along the challenge track to earn better rewards but must be careful as a red skull challenge that is failed means that the mission is failed and all rewards are lost. Sometimes things just don't go well from the start and the player may elect to abort the mission.<br/><br/>Players also have the opportunity to use Guild Card Interrupts to take actions during their opponents turns to disrupt their carefully laid assassination plans.<br/><br/>When the last round finishes players add up their IP from their completed Mission Contract cards, Influence Cards and completed Secret Objective cards(uncompleted cards penalize the player). The player with the most IP wins and becomes the Master of The Assassins Guild in Vance.<br/><br/>"}, "172356": {"poll": {}, "name": "Manic Martians", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3108888_t.jpg", "average": "3", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"588": {"name": "Early Learning Centre"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3108888.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"264847": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "3", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "The Manic Martians Game is a fun game for little ones.

Has many models of play a few of which we review here.  More on our website.<br/><br/>Story Play: The Simplest RoarStack game, for casual group play or children,  is Story Play wherein you relate your card to the previously played card, possibly within the optional theme of the round.  In Story Play, the added sayings and card value/suits don't matter, just the inkblots and the story. This is a good mode for young children and people more interested in collaboration and storytelling than competition.<br/><br/>Point Play: If you want to keep score and compete with others, then you can add the dimension of point play where victory points are scored based on phrase+value on the story cards, when the conversation of the group matches the phrase. You play your victory cards at any time. Victory points can come from mundane things in the conversation from the weather, to social relations, to pop culture. Your inkblots and storytelling can help lead the conversation, but you don't score victory points from what you do/say, only from what your friends do/say.  This mode encourages talking with and listening to your friends and is great for party play. Even when its not your turn to play a card, you need to pay attention and engage in dialog, maybe even trying to guide the conversation so you can score points. However, you also have to be active in the round to score so you have to keep that story going when its your turn.  Victory scoring is generally simple -- you play the victory card in front of you so just count them at the end of the round.<br/><br/>Gestour/Best play: A mode good for larger groups or big/noisy parties is Gestour/Best  mode where everyone competes to try to extend the same story. A gestour is a teller of legendary tales. In this mode the gestour starts a story and everyone picks a card from their had and tries to be the best extension of that story based on the inkblot on their card. After the cards to play are exposed, the gestour defines how they will define &quot;best&quot;. There is an optional 30 second free-for-all period where everyone tries to convince others that theirs is the best extension. The gestour then begins calling on players who have 10 seconds to tell their card's story. The gestour picks the &quot;best&quot; answer and that person becomes the new gestour. Everyone else draws a replacement card. First person out of cards wins the hand.<br/><br/>Twisted Play: Another mode of play is Twisted play, which is good for people who play traditional card games. In Twisted play, you use just the playing card deck, and play your favorite classic card game, with a twist -- you can use the inkblots to connect cards or as wild cards. For example, in Roaring Rummy you might connect a random card into a part of a straight by telling the inkblots' secret stories and connecting  misfit cards to those before and after it in sequence. In Roaring Go Fish, when you pull a card from the pool you can also match it if you can tell the story to connect it to your matching card.  In Solitary Stories you can play any card anywhere, but only if you can tell its story. Here, the role of the stories is to directly help you score points in a classic game. These add RoarStack Story play to existing games, making almost any card wild by using your creativity. It adds a new twist and often a lot more laughter, to well-known games.<br/><br/>Ideation Play: Another mode of play is ideation -- the generation of ideas related to solving a problem.  Here, the player(s) takes a problem to be solved and uses the cards to help explore the problem, the constraints, and potential solutions. RoarStack is not only a fun game; it can also be an innovation tool for improving creativity and problem-solving. Creativity in innovation and problem-solving is often about linking disparate ideas together. Given a topic people see different things in the cards, and seeing things in the cards makes connections to other ideas. In the words of the very innovative Steve Jobs: &quot;Creativity is just connecting things.&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"264955": "First edition"}, "age": "6", "name": "Roarstack", "playingtime": "5", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "average": "5.77", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "172412": {"boardgamedesigner": {"81485": {"name": "Robin David"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Director's Cut: The Card Game", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2461844_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"29477": {"name": "Uncanny Cardboard"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2461844.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"264958": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "In Director's Cut: The Card Game, players are Hollywood movie producers in the early 20th century.

A patrol had mistakenly reported a rebel camp ripe for raiding so Stone, in turn, ordered Colonel Deven to advance on the supposed camp. Having done so, Deven found nothing of the kind. Confused, he settled his men in a defensive position and awaited new orders. Stone decided to send the remainder of the 15th Massachusetts, With Colonel Edward Baker in command, across the river so that he might conduct a reconnaissance in force around Leesburg, VA. A sharp engagement ensued with Baker calling for more reinforcements. The army strength on both sides grew to approximately 1700 men.<br/><br/>Colonel Baker was killed late in the afternoon during a failed attack on the rebel line. Before long, disorganized federal troops were recrossing the river. By early evening The 18th Mississippi arrived and aided in an assault that fully routed the boys in blue. Their artillery abandoned, many Union soldiers were forced down the steep slope called Ball's Bluff and into the river. Soldiers swarmed the waiting boats. Overcrowded, several boats capsized on their way back to Harrison Island. An untold number of Federals drowned in their desperate attempt to escape. By day&rsquo;s end, 223 Union men were killed, 226 were wounded, and 553 were trapped and captured by the advancing rebels.

And while the athletes certainly look the part, their traits and skills have made it difficult to rack up the victories necessary to snag the championship.<br/><br/>The Gruesomes as a team rely on their resilience and sheer strength to dominate opponents and survive attacks. Unfortunately, they lack the hand-eye coordination and speed to have full access to all possible Slaughterball strategies. Indeed, their shooting game is perennially inadequate. Even so, previous coaches have managed to build them into a respectable foe over the course of a season by training them with new skills and concentrating on the strategies explained below.<br/><br/>Coaching the Gruesomes is a challenging task, but your victories will be that much sweeter knowing it was your coaching ability, not the athleticism of your athletes, that won the day. They are slower and less accurate than other teams, and as such you cannot rely on a shooting game to win. Instead, you should doggedly attack your opponents, even taking risky chops to knock them down. You should be chopping every turn. And get everyone moved toward the center of the pit as soon as possible. Field coverage is imperative for the Gruesomes, so they are always in range to attack someone.<br/><br/>Your athletes&rsquo; resilience will help them stay out of the Slaughter Box, and the great Brawling values will usually result in chop success.

It should come as no surprise, then, that wizards, witches, and other powerful spellcasters are always on the lookout for new and exciting spells to add to their repertoires. While many spells from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook received a facelift and an upgrade in Mythic Adventures, the sourcebook that introduced mythic power to the game of Pathfinder, dozens of spells were left behind. Missing Mythic Magic Volume XIV, and its predecessors, aim to give each and every spell from the core rules a full-fledged mythic upgrade, all the way from A to Z, with a special focus on making mythic spells that feel as over-the-top and larger-than-life as possible.<br/><br/>This installment includes 22 mythic spells, from mindblank to passwall. A mythic mind blank grants the additional protection of being able to shut one&rsquo;s mind down entirely in order to avoid harmful mind-affecting effects. A mythic moment of prescience greatly expands the foresight granted by the spell, allowing you to gain a lesser benefit once per round without expending the spell, and also allows you to peer into the future. Mythic mount can not only summon more powerful mounts, like pegasi and nightmares, but can also summon enough mounts to support a small army. Most powerful of all, a mythic miracle can accomplish almost anything the caster can imagine, provided they pour enough effort and magical power into the spell.

After much discussion, King Elvish and his daughter have agreed that the most valiant of her chosen suitors will become heir to the throne. The first Knight to present the Princess with the 3 Gifts of Gallantry she desires will win her favour. To acquire these gifts you must complete quests and obtain Laurels of Valor. Many Quests are impossible to complete alone. So, to demonstrate you are a born leader, you must hire and lead an adventuring party chosen from the most Motley Crew of the Kingdom. But, as a Knight of the Kingdom, you have worked your whole life in service and in turn been supported by the King. You have no gold to spare. In order to secure the necessary gold to pay your crew you must moonlight on OPQ (Other Patron&rsquo;s Quests). Use your gold and crew wisely to quickly complete as many quests as possible.

To complete a Quest and receive the Laurels and daily income from that Quest card, players must match their action dice with the dice icons on the Quest cards.

If a piece that is moved is made inactive at its end position &mdash; i.e., it is self-inactivated &mdash; a player can take an extra move if she so chooses; aside from placing or moving a piece, she can now remove a piece from the board, activate an inactive piece, or pivot an active piece to reorient it.<br/><br/>Another difference between Regatta and Tix/Tixel is that in Regatta pieces aren't at any time allowed to protrude outside of the board.<br/><br/>There's also a variant that allows the game to be played by three players.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"265049": "First edition"}, "average": "6.75", "name": "Regatta", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": {"26432": "Combinatorial"}}, "172471": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1126": {"name": "Christian Freeling"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Io", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2390907_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2390907.png", "boardgameversion": {"265050": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Io is an Othello variant with a more flexible move protocol and a more 'organic' character.

The Olympian deities are in a race to find the successor to Zeus&rsquo;s throne, with the successor acquiring the greatest number of followers. But the gods and goddesses are quite busy, and to shine their light upon the mortals of Hellas requires intervention of a divine scale. Heroic deeds are a must if one is to prove themselves worthy for the gratification of Olympus and the pursuit of seeing their patron deity rise to rulership! Are you strong, brave, and smart enough for the challenge? We will see how you fair against the great beasts of Hellas and the heroes and heroines who support your rival deity. This is the Heavenly Contest. This is Mythos!<br/><br/>The Quick Start Guide presents a Novice-level adventure, The Argonauts&rsquo; Legend, for use with the epic action and adventure setting, Mythos, for Savage Worlds. It also contains five pre-generated characters and all the mechanics necessary to use those characters with Savage Worlds without the need of the Core Setting Guide or Player&rsquo;s Guide. This is a great way to introduce players and GMs to the Mythos setting, along with providing current fans with a full adventure module.<br/><br/>The mighty hero Jason is preparing to set sails on the ship Argo, but Poseidon is preventing him from doing so. The only solution is to seek the aid of Orpheus to appease Poseidon and the dangerous waves to allow the ship to leave port. However, Orpheus is in Hades&rsquo; Realm, and it&rsquo;s up to the heroic PCs to delve into the underground and bring him back.

Zagreus was left with a difficult choice: enduring a bad ruler in the future or taking part in the Heavenly Contest, being forced to spend time scheming instead of partying.

After more than a thousand years, the Heavenly Contest ended without a winner.

People now rely on philosophy and reason, deserting the temples. Demigods are no longer born and less heroic deeds are regularly performed to please the gods. While the Olympians are looking for a way to regain their former influence over the Cosmos, a new rising god from the east threatens the safety of Hellas and wishes to destroy the twelve Olympians. Ahura Mazda, god of the Persians, challenges Zeus while inciting his followers to conquer the Cosmos to become its only ruler. King Xerxes, son of Darius, leads a huge army against Hellas while Ahura Mazda fights with his Daevas against the Olympians.<br/><br/>The Persian army is moving on Hellas; King Leonidas marches his Spartan army to the pass of Thermopylae after building an army of Hellenes.
