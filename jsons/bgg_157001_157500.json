Heroes obtain loot cards at the end of combat in addition to leveling their characters stats.

On your turn you must do the following actions:<br/><br/>1) PLAY A TILE from your Activation Area.<br/><br/>The first tile played by each player WILL NOT ACTIVATE ITS ABILITY. So it is very important you choose well which of your archetypes wont be used in the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>A tile played must always be adjacent to another tile (even diagonally) So you cannot place a tile anywhere in the imaginary grid.<br/><br/>A tile played always enters the game on the side it was in the Activation Area. So if the tile played was ACTIVE it stays with the side of the banner up and if the tile was INACTIVE it stays with the side that has a token drawn.<br/><br/>Consider INACTIVE tiles as protected from abilities when they are in PLAY since abilities cannot target INACTIVE tiles. It&acute;s a very good strategy to keep this in mind because an opponent won&acute;t be able to affect one of your INACTIVE tiles.<br/><br/>2) ACTIVE its ability (if possible)<br/><br/>Tiles that have been affected by an ability are turned to the INACTIVE SIDE (the one with the token on it). Same happens with the King and Queen.<br/><br/>Abilities cannot affect tiles that are in play with the INACTIVE SIDE up. This means that once a tile has been turned to the INACTIVE SIDE it&acute;s safe on the board. It can be moved as usual by its owner but will not altered by an opponent.<br/><br/><br/>3) MOVE ONE OF YOUR TILES IN PLAY ONE SPACE (diagonally or perpendicularly)<br/><br/>Notice that the joker has a special ability that allows you to move ONE MORE TIME after you placed it. This is a very strategical ability that can make big difference when you are trying to reposition a high influence tile on your turn or when you want to remove an opponent tile as well. Under no circumstance a tile can end up or move over another tile in the table.<br/><br/>When you move a tile it must always end adjacent to another tile. So you cannot move it on empty space unless it ended there due to the movement of the other tiles.<br/><br/><br/>END GAME &amp; WINNING CONDITIONS<br/><br/>The game will end when one of this two conditions happen:<br/><br/>1) One player starts his/her turn with his target consort surrounded by his own tiles  (perpendicularly).<br/><br/>The victory is total. The more you play the less this condition is going to happen.<br/><br/>2) The players have played all of their tiles.<br/><br/>Once the players have played all of their tiles comes the scoring. For this step only the tiles that surround PERSPERNDICULARLY (up, down and sides) each royal consort will count. Add all the influence numbers in the tiles, PLUS all the tokens if there are INACTIVE tiles among them (each one is worth 1 point) MINUS the total influence on the tiles your opponent has surrounding your royal consort. Compare this numbers... the player with the most influence WINS the game.

He often goes running along the forest paths with his dog Oscar. All the animals in the forest know him. Alex is also a great dreamer. Sometimes he sits under a tree and turns the pages of his favourite book: The Big Farming Book.<br/>He sits there enjoying the sun, cooled by a gentle breeze. On such occasions Alex sometimes falls asleep and dreams of a magnificent farm with cows, funny little hens and affectionate horses. One day, Alex and Oscar went running in a field at the edge of the forest. In the middle of the field stood<br/>a scarecrow to keep the crows away. When Oscar and Alex passed close to the scarecrow they heard a strange noise. Alex was surprised and looked all around, but couldn't see anything strange or unusual. Just as Alex and Oscar were about to continue their race, Alex heard the noise again. It was as if someone was calling him: - Psst! Pssst! Alex, it's me!<br/>It was the scarecrow! Alex couldn't believe his eyes.<br/>- But...! You can speak! said Alex in surprise.<br/>-Yes, of course I can speak, said the scarecrow. But I only speak to children who like animals and nature. Like you, Alex!<br/>The scarecrow had a big smile. He looked nice and funny at the same time. He spoke again:<br/>-You know what Alex? I often see you sleeping under a tree in the forest. Did you know that when you dream in the middle of the forest, your dreams can come true?<br/>- Er... No, I didn't know that, said Alex.<br/>-Well, because you're a good little boy and you love nature so much, I'm going to tell you a secret: when you wake up, all you have to do is concentrate very intensely on your dream and do everything you canto make it come true!<br/>- That's easy! said Alex.<br/>- Yes! But above all, you mustn't forget to have fun! Other<br/>wise, it's no longer a dream!<br/>- Thanks, Mr Scarecrow! That's a great secret!<br/>- Bye, bye!<br/>As soon as Alex had finished talking with the scarecrow, he and Miro ran faster than ever in the direction of a large oak tree, the most majestic tree in the forest. Alex was keen to see if the scarecrow had been telling the truth. He sat down under the tree and shut his eyes. He listened to the birds sing<br/>ing and the sound of the wind in the trees, but Alex couldn't manage to fall asleep. He was far too excited by the<br/>scarecrow's secret! So he picked up his favourite book, the Good Farmer's Handbook and started to look at the pictures one after the other. Little by little, his eyelids shut and he fell asleep. And dreamt... He dreamt of his family, and a magnificent farm.<br/><br/>User addition:  Alex Builds his Farm is a Playmobil videogame<br/><br/>"}, "157173": {"rpgartist": ["Alan Lathwell", "Nils Marheinecke", "Stefan Trapp"], "rpg": ["Dungeonslayers"], "poll": [], "name": "First Slay: Dein Weg ins Rollenspiel", "rpgdesigner": ["Nils Marheinecke"], "rpgproducer": ["Christian Kennig", "Nils Marheinecke"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1988079.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "rpgitemversion": ["Klammerheftung", "PDF"], "average": "6.5", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Uhrwerk Verlag"], "rpgcategory": ["Quick Start / Fast Play Rules"], "rpgseries": ["Gratisrollenspieltag 2014"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1988079_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/>First Slay is a Dungeonslayers quick start, first released for the German Gratisrollenspieltag 2014 (print booklet and free download).

A Campaign Game, an Historical Summary, Orders of Battle, and Designer's Notes are included to help put the scenarios in the larger context of operations in Normandy and allow players to design their own scenarios.<br/><br/>"}, "157194": {"poll": [], "name": "Pumpkin Collector", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Web browser edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Horror", "Occult"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["Web Browser"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Control a man with a pumpkin on his head.

They may use it at any time in the game to send any train out of the station early (as in immediately the whistle blows). However, if the tile hasn't been used and another player becomes the lowest scorer then they take the tile. The tile may only be used once during the entire game (that is ONCE not once per player) - put it back in the box when it has been used.<br/><br/>Tile #2: The Guard's Flag<br/>This tile may also only be used once per game. It begins on the table next to the train stack. On their turn any player may decide to use the Flag instead of taking their normal turn (ie they do not get to play a carriage or place a passenger chit). The Flag is placed above a train which shows that the train has a fault and cannot be moved. Remove all the passenger chits and return them to their owners, then discard the carriages and the train engine - no one scores this train.

By learning a trade, each player&rsquo;s daughter can focus and increase her physical attributes to build a foundation for her later career; money she earns by practicing her trade can help pay tuition for schooling to align her skills with her ultimate goal.<br/><br/>By overseeing his or her daughter&rsquo;s training, leisure activities, and diet, each player may choose to steer his or her daughter&rsquo;s progress toward any among the number of endings available exclusively to her in a particular game; but each player&rsquo;s ultimate success depends not on the relative prestige of the career he or she chooses for his or her daughter, but rather on his or her daughter&rsquo;s success in that career: A hunter who knows her trade may do better in life than a princess who cannot inspire the love of her subjects.<br/><br/>Players construct their daughters&rsquo; character decks gradually all year long, building toward the yearly harvest festival, in which each player&rsquo;s daughter can compete against other contestants in a variety of contests to win prestige, prizes, and royal favor. During the festival, players enter any contests of their choosing by selecting hands of cards from their daughters&rsquo; character decks, then playing out those hands of cards against the other players in each contest. Cards won increase each daughter&rsquo;s reputation in her associated skill and raise her likelihood of encountering rivals striving in those same skills during the rest of the year. Cards saved back from the contest form each player&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s character deck for the next year, helping her focus her work and training as she prepares for the next festival and, ultimately, aims at her chosen destiny.<br/><br/>Players who feel confident in their daughters&rsquo; training can go adventuring outside the confines of the capital city in hopes of finding help unavailable through normal means, whether from new acquaintances, after defeating enemies, through fairy meetings, or in undiscovered troves. Those who focus chiefly on schooling can benefit from the benevolence of the various deities who oversee the various mental and physical arts in the kingdom. And those whose skills lend themselves less toward adventuring and training and more toward society can try to find their place in the capital&rsquo;s social life by cultivating helpful relationships among those who live in the palace&mdash;and can eventually aspire to a position among the kingdom&rsquo;s nobility, perhaps even its royalty.<br/><br/>But raising a daughter isn&rsquo;t easy. Keeping her healthy means feeding her well, and both feeding her and training her cost money. Yet the work she does to help earn that money can increase her resentment if she feels too much is being required of her&mdash;if she works or studies too long without time to herself, if she wears herself out adventuring without time vacationing to renew her energy. And if her resentment grows, she may fall into delinquency, may even run away from home without considering the consequences of abandoning her schooling or missing a festival.<br/><br/>So it&rsquo;s up to you to do what you can to shepherd her through the difficulties of growing up, teaching her how to work and how to learn and giving her skills for the life she eventually chooses to live. She may not be grateful at the time, but as you teach her to be moral and industrious, to work hard at getting ahead, she will come, in the end, to be thankful for the discipline you&rsquo;ve helped her maintain during her formative years.<br/><br/>And when she turns 18, your job is over: She is of age, free to follow her own path in life. And you can only hope she feels kindly toward you for the role you played in her upbringing, for the tools you have helped her equip herself with. Because whatever part she chooses to play among those who live in the capital city&mdash;even in the kingdom overall&mdash;it is you who helped give her the chance to choose that path, and you who prepared her to succeed in it. Your parenting skills will be reflected in her success.<br/><br/>"}, "157204": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Sunda", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1975824_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Diana-Spieleverlag Robert Enz"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1975824.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The goal of the game ist to get points by enclosing opponent playing pieces.

There are plenty of resources out there, but you have to get to them and survive various encounters and attacks to reach towns that have potential as safe havens. You&rsquo;ll have to plan your route to include spots that have the assets you&rsquo;ll need to stockpile. Some of these spots are controlled by raiders, and you&rsquo;ll have to survive attacks to gain the items you need.<br/><br/>Once you&rsquo;ve scouted locations, you&rsquo;ll have to return to center city for your family and more supplies.  You then pick a location as your final destination. If you can get there with the required supplies and survivors before anyone else, you win the game.<br/><br/>The game dynamic revolves around the management of assets while you are traveling to your destinations. You'll be tempted to use them to gain an edge in an encounter, but you have to stockpile them to be able to win the game. Different gameplay styles and a unique route traveled in each game, coupled with game-changing Bonus cards, make Doom and Bloom SURVIVAL! a fun and challenging game.

Will you fulfill the prophecy? Invoke the old Djinns and move the Tribes into position at the right time, and the Sultanate may become yours!<br/><br/>Designed by Bruno Cathala, Five Tribes builds on a long tradition of German-style games that feature wooden meeples.

But devising a winning strategy will take a more calculated approach than our standard fare. You need to carefully consider what moves can score you well and put your opponents at a disadvantage.

The other Cult Leaders at the table can attempt to disrupt your sacrifice by casting spells to move the Shoggoth away from you, stealing Minions from your hand, or any one of many dastardly methods (Rival Cult Leaders are insidious that way).<br/><br/>If the active player is still able to keep the Shoggoth in front of them during their sacrifice phase, the Minion is gobbled up, the player earns a point token, the Shoggoth moves to the player to the left, and the active player draws back up to their hand limit.<br/><br/>The winner is either the first player to reach the victory point goal (determined how many players are participating), or the last player standing.<br/><br/>The theme of the game is based on the works of HP Lovecraft; those players who are familiar with either the stories of HPL and/or the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game will recognize many of the names and terms on the cards.

Plants is also a modular, organic game system that can grow and adapt beyond a single game board or a set of rules. The game is not meant to be an educational simulation, but more like an open creative project that deliberately intertwines certain biological concepts with suitable board game mechanisms.<br/><br/>During the game, the players continuously move through several different types of phases and perform actions at their own pace. They must try to adapt to the whims of the competing players and manipulate the upcoming situations to help them pollinate their flowers and gather enough nutrients and energy to produce seeds. At same time the players may sprout from the seeds, use the nutrients to grow in the habitat area and be forced to use up their energy to get rid of pesky larvae. Having enough water available is always a concern, and sometimes the players must accept losing their precious biomass. And if the players are not careful, they might even be eliminated from the game completely.<br/><br/>Plants features no randomness after a simple setup and there are no auctions, negotiations or trading.

Bulwark sovereigns believe that their greatest contribution to their allies is to be the shield before the blow, protecting their allies from any incoming harm. With pure hearts and noble ideals, they rush to the forefront of battle or debate, placing the needs of those that they protect before their own.

Well, it just so happened that last weekend there was a 48 hour mini-jam that coincided with a relatively calm weekend.  I decided to jump in and see about cranking out a game.  Due to some amazing weather I ended up spending about half the weekend outside doing yard work, and worked on this game when I needed a break from the weeds.The theme of the jam was &quot;de-makes&quot; which meant all the participants were invited to re-make a game of their choosing in a low-fidelity, low-tech or otherwise deconstructed format.  After kicking the idea around in my head for a while, I decided to de-make the original Legend of Zelda.  My de-make would be to rebuild the game, but with a viewport of just 16 x 16 pixels.  No interpolation, no cheating, just 16 x 16 blocks of one color each.<br/><br/>To figure out if this crazy idea even made sense, I did some tests in photoshop to make sure the various pages of the world map would fit into the 16 x 16 limit.  Fortunately the Zelda map screens are all a tile grid of 16 x 10 tiles.  This fits nicely into my limit with a few pixels to spare for the status area at the top.  The final content actually fits into a 16 x 14 pixel rectangle, so I beat my limit by 32 pixels!<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "157397": {"poll": [], "name": "Hippo Hunt Game", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Hippopotamus"], "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2631960_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Hallmark Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2631960.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Hippo Hunt"], "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Animals", "Children's Game"], "age": "4", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "From the package:<br/><br/>Spill the critters<br/>take your pick<br/>find the hippo<br/>Do it QUICK!<br/><br/>The game pieces are 24 plastic animals packaged in a plastic tube.<br/><br/>There are 2 ways to play the game.<br/><br/>- Dump all the animals onto a table.

And don't forget to pay your crew when ships return! Carefully balance time management and timing to earn the most points in this medium-weight worker placement and resource management game.<br/><br/>In more detail, over twelve rounds players take turns placing two workers per round, one at a time. The town board and whaling board contain basic game actions: taking goods (food, wood, brick), selling goods, building buildings, docking ships, and launching ships. These actions can be used multiple times per round, with the first player to do so in a round receiving a bonus or more goods or reducing the number of goods paid.<br/><br/>Most buildings add extra action spaces with new actions, combined actions, and more powerful versions of basic actions. You own whatever you build, with others needing to pay to use them and you earning points from them at game's end.<br/><br/>You need to pay to send ships whaling, choosing how far out to send them. At the end of the round, ships move closer to shore and whale tokens are drawn randomly. Ships that are farthest out have first chance to pick the valuable sperm whales, but as they move in, others have the opportunity to launch farther out and get a better pick, possibly leaving you with only empty seas. Over the course of the game, whales become more rare and empty seas more common. Once a ship reaches shore, a percentage of the profits (the &quot;lay&quot;) must be paid in order to keep the whales selected.<br/><br/>After twelve rounds, all ships must return, and players total their points from buildings, whales, and extra money.

Then the players alternately make their moves thereafter.<br/><br/>Rules of the Game: This checkers variation is played using an 8 x 8, or 64 squares checker board of light and dark squares and each player has 12 pieces of contrasting colors, usually red and white. The board is placed between the two players in such a way that the double corner is on the right side and a dark colored square is on the left side of each player. The player places his pieces on the first three rows on his side of the board<br/><br/>The Moves of the Men: Checker players can only move their pieces forward one at a time on each empty square to the left or to the right. If a player successfully moves his pieces to the last, or &quot;king row,&quot; then that piece must be crowned &quot;king&quot; by the opponent by placing a second checker on top of the crowned piece.<br/><br/>The Moves of the King: King pieces are &quot;flying kings,&quot; which means that they can move over many empty squares on the diagonal lines that pass over the square on which they are located.<br/><br/>Captures: In Brazilian Checkers captures are mandatory. And, maximum captures are compulsory as well, which means that if a player has more than one way to capture the opposing pieces then he must choose that way that will result in the capture of the most number of pieces. If a checker piece reaches the king row while in a capture sequence, it must keep on capturing pieces backward for as long as there still pieces to capture. That capturing piece cannot be crowned king unless it finishes the move and stops on king row.<br/><br/>Captures by the Men: Men can capture by jumping forward or backward over a single piece that is located next to it only if the square located next to the captured piece is unoccupied. If the man can jump again from its landing square to make another capture, then it must do so because all captures are mandatory.<br/><br/>Captures by a King: A crowned piece can capture an opponent's piece forward and backward diagonally if it is on the same path where it is located and if the squares between them are unoccupied and that if the square immediately after the piece that will be captured is also unoccupied. The crowned piece can land on any empty square within the same path and if a continuous capture is possible, then the player must keep on capturing even if this move will not redound to the best interest of the player making the capture.<br/><br/>The Winning Player: A player wins the game if he has captured all of his opponent's pieces or successfully blocked his opponent's pieces such that the opponent is unable to move any of his pieces.<br/><br/>Conditions for a Draw: The players can mutually agree to a draw. A draw may also happen if the same position has occurred three times during the game, or if there are three crowned pieces playing against one and that both players have made 16 moves without attaining any promotion or making a capture.<br/><br/>Information from checkershistory.com<br/><br/>"}, "157417": {"rpgdesigner": ["Chris Birch"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF"], "poll": [], "name": "Tales From The Crucible", "rpgartist": ["Dim Martin"], "rpgproducer": ["Chris Birch", "Michal E.

A journey between settlements of what should have been a day or two has become twice as long; everyone is desperate to reach a roaring fire and a full stew pot.<br/><br/>The appearance of the village, the party's intended destination, seems perfectly timed. The locals are heading for the central cathedral and talk of warmth, light, and succor while encouraging everyone to, &quot;get out of the darkness.&quot; Following this advice, the adventurers find themselves in the middle of a service to mark the ending of the longest night and a return to the comfort of daylight&mdash;thanks to an ancient relic.<br/><br/>However the ceremony does not go smoothly as several interruptions prevent the high priest from properly fulfilling his duties. The PCs called upon to aid another band of travelers before helping drive off unexpected undead! But all of this is just the precursor to worse events; slavers appear, attempting to capture villagers and drag them away. These malicious enemies are like none seen before, accompanied by strange creatures that target the building and individuals alike. The local residents are hard-pressed to face these foes and the party proves to be a vital force in preventing a devastating defeat!<br/><br/>Can the PCs deal with the many problems before them, overcoming multiple challenges as an unknown enemy attacks the cathedral from all directions? Can the party face down the slavers, rescuing the villagers from a terrible fate, or will they fall for the tricks and bluffs of the mysterious humanoids that use the very darkness as a weapon?

Unbeknownst to the rest of you, one of your friends is secretly a Cultist, eager to sacrifice the rest of you to their dark master.<br/><br/>The Academics must work together to accomplish the goals of the scenario before the stars align and the Cultist is able to pull off their scheme, reveal themselves, and summon a Shoggoth, a flight of Night Gaunts, or reveal themselves to have been a Mi-Go the whole time, to pick three example Cultists from a single scenario, the Fungi from Yuggoth.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds, consisting of each player taking a turn, and then one University Phase. On a turn, a player draws an Event card related to their location, resolves it using a push-your-luck ability check mechanic which forces them to make trade offs between personal harm or harm to the group, and then takes two Actions: Move, Fight, Search, Steal, Trade, Use an Item, or a Scenario specific event. The University Phase consist of moving any monsters that may be on the board, followed by the starting player drawing two University cards, selecting one to play and one to shuffle back into the deck without revealing. These cards are all bad for the Academics, but in different ways and to different degrees, so this is another opportunity for the Cultist to secretly advance their own agenda. The starting player then passes the Starting Player token to their left and a new round begins.<br/><br/>The Academic players are trying to complete their Scenario specific goals before the Cultist kills them. For instance, in the Fungi from Yuggoth scenario, the Academic goals are: A1: assemble a complete Elder Sign, A2: take it to Chapel, B1: find the Necronomicon in the Vault or Library, B2: use it as described on its card. Players gain Elder Sign pieces by successfully completing Events, by searching, or by making them in the Art Department with a Finesse check. Players look for the Necronomicon in the Library with Reason checks, or the Vault with Focus checks. Events also have a chance of advancing the Star Chartz The Academics win if they complete their goals before the last of them is killed, the Cultist wins if they kill all of the Academics. When the Star Chart reaches a certain number, the Cultist may reveal themselves to gain some horrid benefit. For instance, in the Fungi from Yuggoth, all players know that the Cultist is trying to get the Star Chart to either 15 so they can reveal themselves to be a Mi-Go in a human costume, or 20 so they can summon a trio of Night Gaunts, or 25 so they can summon a Shoggoth. All players know these are the options, but only the Cultist knows which one they are actually trying to do.<br/><br/>Cultists of Cthulhu is a big-box, semicooperative, thematic game of mystery, investigation, teamwork, and betrayal. The board is modular, and assembled at the beginning of each game in a rapid-fire, real-time setup. With this very fast, unique map setup, 12 characters, 4 different scenarios, each with multiple possible hidden Cultist goals, Cultists of Cthulhu provides near infinite diversity and replayability.<br/><br/>Featuring an ability check mechanism using custom dice which allows for meaningful decisions every turn, an innovative combat system, dark, suspenseful art, and gripping theme music, Cultists of Cthulhu has been called &quot;possibly the next Arkham Horror.&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "14", "name": "Cultists of Cthulhu", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Modular Board", "Player Elimination", "Press Your Luck"], "average": "7.96087", "usersrated": "23", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Cthulhu Mythos"]}, "157453": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1990416.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jason Tagmire"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": ["Campbell Whyte"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Button Shy"], "boardgameintegration": ["Storyteller Cards: Fantasy", "Storyteller Cards: Fantasy"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1990416_t.png", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "description": "Storyteller Cards are a playing card deck, designed to inspire creativity in gamers, role-players, writers, artists, teachers, parents and children.

In ihnen befanden sich die Regeln f&uuml;r Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D), das erste Fantasy-Rollenspiel. Alles was danach kam, von The Bard s Tale bis World of Warcraft , hat seinen Ursprung in diesen sogenannten Pen&amp;Paper-Rollenspielen, die man mit Papier, Bleistift und W&uuml;rfeln spielte. Viele derer, die man heute als Generation C64 oder als Nerds bezeichnet, sa&szlig;en in den Siebzigern und Achtzigern mit Freunden um den K&uuml;chentisch und durchstreiften als Zwerge oder Elfen Verliese voller Monster.

It&rsquo;s 20 minutes of family fun created by children&rsquo;s book author/illustrator, Eric Wight.<br/><br/>OBJECT OF THE GAME<br/>Combine the highest scoring HEAD card with a BODY card to win the cards for that round. The game winner is the player who collects the most Beasties.<br/><br/>WHO IS BEASTIE BASH! FOR?<br/>Beastie Bash! is for kids with wild imaginations. For families who prefer silly to serious. For parents &amp; educators who think the world needs innovators, not fill-in-the-bubblers.<br/><br/>THE BIRTH OF BEASTIE BASH! <br/>The concept for Beastie Bash! was inspired by Eric Wight&rsquo;s experiences as both a parent and a children&rsquo;s book author. His favorite hobby is playing games with his kids. So he thought it would be fun to create a game they could all play together. But that was just the beginning.<br/><br/>&ldquo;This past year, my daughter was diagnosed with dyslexia. As I was designing Beastie Bash! I realized that this game could also be a fun tool to help her improve her reading and math skills. We can play it for hours and it doesn&rsquo;t feel like homework to her. Plus, by mixing up the cards, the text is continually changing.&rdquo;<br/><br/>As an author, Eric has the opportunity to travel around the world teaching kids what it&rsquo;s like to create stories for a living. At these events, students brainstorm ideas for new adventures, which Eric illustrates on the spot.<br/><br/>&ldquo;The kids always have so many cool ideas that it&rsquo;s tough to choose just one. So I thought it would be fun to mash a few together. I could never have predicted how much it made the students and teachers laugh. I realized I was onto something, and set out to create a game that captured that same creative, unpredictable humor.&rdquo;<br/><br/>RULES OF PLAY<br/><br/>SET UP<br/>2 - 4 players. Shuffle the deck. Evenly divide the cards face down to each player. No peeking!<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/>Each player draws 5 cards from their pile. Pair a HEAD and BODY combination to make the highest score possible and place it in front of you. A color match earns an additional +5 points, a MEGA-MATCH earns +10 points and a &quot;TRUE MATCH&quot; (i.e.: the original head and body combination) earns double points.<br/><br/>POWER PRIZES<br/>Once everyone has revealed their Beastie, players may improve their chance of winning by using a POWER PRIZE card if they possess one. Begin with the player who has the lowest scoring Beastie and continue clockwise. The player with the highest scoring Beastie wins all of the Beasties from this round. Discard the used POWER PRIZE cards.<br/><br/>THE BOOM! CARD<br/>The BOOM! card is very powerful and may be played at any time. When a player uses a BOOM! card, it scares away all of the Beasties. Everyone's cards are discarded no matter what their point value is or what POWER PRIZE cards are being used. Bummer!<br/><br/>TIE-BREAKER<br/>If at the end of the round the score is tied, players may draw enough cards to refill their hand and play another Beastie. Repeat until the tie is broken.<br/><br/>NO PAIRS<br/>If you are unable to make a pair with your cards, you must:<br/><br/>1. Discard 2 cards from your hand.<br/><br/>2a. Use the top 2 cards from your collected Beastie pile.<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>2b. Draw 2 cards from your unused deck. If you draw two cards from your unused deck, you must discard all 5 cards AND lose your turn. At the beginning of the next round you may draw 5 new cards.<br/><br/>ENDING THE GAME<br/>The game ends when the first player runs out of cards. Count how many Beasties you collected. The player with the most wins!<br/><br/>ALTERNATE GAME PLAY<br/>1-player: Similar to a traditional match game. Place all the cards face down. The object is to find the Power Prizes before you find the Boom! cards. Turn them over two at a time to find Power Prizes. Once you find a character match, it can be removed from the board. If you flip over 4 Boom! cards, you lose.<br/><br/>LEVEL-UP WITH LEARNING<br/>Beastie Bash! isn&rsquo;t just fun to play, it&rsquo;s also a great tool for learning both at home and in the classroom.<br/><br/>READING: Each card contains funny flavor text that brings the characters to life. With each new match, the text changes, creating countless new reading experiences.<br/><br/>MATH: Kids practice addition skills as they play each round of the game. Older kids can multiply instead of add to make the math more challenging.<br/><br/>WRITING: Create your own adventures using the mix-and-match cards as writing prompts.<br/><br/>"}, "157478": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Troy Pichelman"], "poll": [], "name": "Conquest of the Stars", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2676481_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "JTP Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2676481.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "Second Edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Space Exploration"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Conquest of the Stars is a strategy card game for 2-4 players where the goal is simple: you are out to capture more planets than your opponents. <br/>Of course your opponents are trying to do the same thing, so it's not going to be easy ...<br/><br/>Each turn you draw cards to add to your fleet, then explore to find a planet.

Attack bonuses, hit dice, class skills, spells, and class features have been unified and spread evenly over levels. This means that most prestige archetypes have their prestige abilities spread over the entire 20 level spread. Unlike how prestige classes normally work, these archetypes have a few complete class abilities rather than many abilities limited to a low level. In some cases, you get the choice of one of several class abilities rather than stymied versions of all the abilities.<br/><br/>A prestige archetype generally has elements of one or more regular character classes, to represent how prestige prerequisites were met and character development after the prestige class has ended. Sometimes there is more than one class that naturally leads itself to a particular prestige class, which can lead to several different prestige archetypes for different combinations. A few are not built on a regular class, instead expanding the idea behind the prestige class to a full 20 levels.<br/><br/>"}}
