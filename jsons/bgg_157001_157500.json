At the end of a round, players score according to their markers cards that they managed to save (cockatoos or life-savers).<br/><br/>There is a further twist! Players then pick up all their playing hand, and pass it clockwise. So as each round commences, you are using the cards previously used by your neighbor! Are you smarter? Can you make a better fist of the same hand your neighbor had? Play out rounds till all players have had each hand, top score wins.<br/><br/>Source: BoardGameGeek.<br/><br/>"}, "157025": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Restricted Area", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"236338": "Windows German Edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2281": "Cyberpunk"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2339": "Action RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Game Box<br/>Restricted Area is an action-packed cyber-punk RPG set in the year 2083.

Players pick a character background card (ex:  Ogre Slayer, Swindler King, etc.) and add special power cards to them (ex: Fireball, Backstab, etc.) they then draw a Flaw card which gives them a unique attribute (ex: chronic liar, Impatient, etc.) and a personal goal card (in secret) which they must complete in addition to the main quest to win the game (ex:  Outsmart an enemy, Betray a party member, etc.).<br/><br/>During combat the game is played on modular map cards with heroes and monsters acting in sequence; the storyteller controls all the monsters. Heroes obtain loot cards at the end of combat in addition to leveling their characters stats. To win the game, each player must complete the main quest developed by the storyteller (through the use of the quest cards) as well as their own personal quest cards (which are kept hidden until completed).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"236427": "First edition"}, "average": "7.53846", "name": "Pocket Odyssey", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2073": "Acting"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "26", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "157054": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Threshold (Issue 3 - Mar 2014) The Sea of Dread", "rpgproducer": {"70887": "Giampaolo Agosta"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1988751.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "average": "6", "rpgissue": {"23624": "Threshold"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"116927": "Bararna Island"}, "rpg": {"389": "Basic Dungeons & Dragons"}, "rpgissueversion": {"236429": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1988751_t.jpg", "description": "From back of Issue:<br/><br/>The Sea of Dread - these dark tempestuous waters loom off the southern coast of Brun, a raging force of nature that has shaped many of the nations in the Known World.

As with the first Wasteland Ruins, there are plenty of minor details to give the map life, such as burning barrels, diner tables, filthy cots, and lots and lots of rubble.  Plenty of places for your players or their enemies to hide or take cover in when battle erupts!<br/><br/>As with any of Stoneworker Cartography's battle maps, there is no need to print out the entire battle map.  If you prefer, you can simply print out specific sections of this map and save the other parts for later!  Be sure to refer to the included map print key to help you figure out which sections to print if you're only interested in certain smaller sections of the battle map.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>     75&quot; x 80&quot; in size.  Much larger than most standard gaming tables, so print out what you need and save the rest for later encounters!<br/>     Square, Hex, or No Grid versions.  Choose which type of grid you want to use and off you go!<br/>     Full Color versions &ndash; These maps are printer intensive, full color versions of each level.<br/>     Black and White version &ndash; There is an included black and white battle map with square grid for those that wish to save on ink.<br/>     VTT Map &ndash; If you prefer to play your games online, there is an included VTT map properly sized for VTT software.<br/>     Print Key Map - To better help GM's plan which sections to print out.  Using this key, you can tell your printer to print out only certain pages of the PDF, thereby saving ink and time putting the map together.  If you don't need a map covering roughly six and a half feet square, then perhaps its better to consult this key and get only what you need for your encounters.  The key shows the corresponding PDF page number for that particular page.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "157068": {"rpgitemversion": {"236445": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "A Little Adventure", "rpgproducer": {"43932": "Travis Legge"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1971237.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"38751": "Contagion"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"9301": "Contagion Role Playing Game"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpggenre": {"954": "Crime (Conspiracy)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1971237_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>A Little Adventure is a system enhancement for Contagion Second Edition.<br/><br/>A Little Adventure can serve as an introductory story for Contagion Second Edition, or simply as a collection of resources that the Gamemaster can add to an existing campaign.

The dungeon has over fifty rooms and hallway sections, mostly empty to allow the Game Master to add features to them. There are several rooms with added details such as a rusted cage, a grate, a drain, spider webs, cobra and gargoyle statues, altars, pillars, green mosses, craters, large pit, portals, a water canal, a straw mat, and several rooms with different patterns depicted on the floor.<br/><br/>Old Style Dungeon Level 02 is intended for use in fantasy settings. It could also be used as a dungeon or cave in more modern or futuristic settings.<br/><br/>Old Style Dungeon Level 02 can be printed out and used in full or it can be printed out in sections. Print out all the sections for the room(s) you want to use, which will result in smaller maps for smaller gaming tables.<br/><br/>For adventure hooks there are multiple elements here. Many of the adventure ideas mentioned in the Old Style Dungeon Level 01 description are equally viable here.<br/><br/>There is a golden cobra statue on a dais and the pattern of a white snake drawn on the floor of one of the rooms. Is this the lair of some sort of snake cult? What is the purpose of the room with the two golden birds sitting on an altar facing the statue of the gargoyle?

Its many parts live in balance with each other, always seeking a stable equilibrium, a way to remove the chaff and produce a wasteless, sustainable whole. Brewmasters, however, live to upset this equilibrium, at least on a very small scale. Trained in the production of microcosms that are so off-kilter that the inhabitants literally eat themselves to death, brewmasters are interested in manipulating how these tiny creatures finish themselves off.

Without nature, there's nothing to throw in a keg, and without a keg full of fermented goodness, the good times simply cannot roll. Wise rather than intelligent, many brewmasters are known friends of druids and rangers, as they embrace nature and its gifts in a similar fashion.

Each turn you change your speed, drive and take an action. You attack your opponents with your mounted guns, molotovs, rockets and more, lay mines or leave oil puddles for the guys behind you to slip in, ram other cars and wracks out of your way.

Players control an organization with the resources and intent to explore, develop, and colonize the worlds beyond Earth. Organizations that practice careful planning and resource management, with a healthy dose of technology research will succeed. Destination: Neptune moves through four generations of space exploration. Players earn Victory Points by building large commercial outposts and colonies, as well as from fame and outright purchases. After four generations, the player with the most Victory Points wins the game.<br/><br/>This is a card driven game in which most Cards have an action that happens immediately, and another action for all of the players (including the player who played the card). Players can also sell cards in exchange for currency. When you sell a card, it goes to an Opportunity Track and is placed to the side of the board. If the Opportunity Track already has as many cards as players, the rightmost card is discarded. You may not change the order of the cards in the Opportunity Track. Players can play cards from the Opportunity Track as if they were in their hands.<br/><br/>Players must use the cards to gain currency and fuel in order to launch space missions to establish bases, factories and colonies on various locations within our solar system. Careful hand and resource management is key to winning the game. In addition, players also need to research certain technologies in order to build on most locations. Technologies are researched through card play and paying currency. The cards are separated into 4 piles which are separate generations. At the end of each generation, each player scores points for the various structures they've built.

On your turn you must do the following actions:<br/><br/>1) PLAY A TILE from your Activation Area.<br/><br/>The first tile played by each player WILL NOT ACTIVATE ITS ABILITY. So it is very important you choose well which of your archetypes wont be used in the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>A tile played must always be adjacent to another tile (even diagonally) So you cannot place a tile anywhere in the imaginary grid.<br/><br/>A tile played always enters the game on the side it was in the Activation Area. So if the tile played was ACTIVE it stays with the side of the banner up and if the tile was INACTIVE it stays with the side that has a token drawn.<br/><br/>Consider INACTIVE tiles as protected from abilities when they are in PLAY since abilities cannot target INACTIVE tiles. It&acute;s a very good strategy to keep this in mind because an opponent won&acute;t be able to affect one of your INACTIVE tiles.<br/><br/>2) ACTIVE its ability (if possible)<br/><br/>Tiles that have been affected by an ability are turned to the INACTIVE SIDE (the one with the token on it). Same happens with the King and Queen.<br/><br/>Abilities cannot affect tiles that are in play with the INACTIVE SIDE up. This means that once a tile has been turned to the INACTIVE SIDE it&acute;s safe on the board. It can be moved as usual by its owner but will not altered by an opponent.<br/><br/><br/>3) MOVE ONE OF YOUR TILES IN PLAY ONE SPACE (diagonally or perpendicularly)<br/><br/>Notice that the joker has a special ability that allows you to move ONE MORE TIME after you placed it. This is a very strategical ability that can make big difference when you are trying to reposition a high influence tile on your turn or when you want to remove an opponent tile as well. Under no circumstance a tile can end up or move over another tile in the table.<br/><br/>When you move a tile it must always end adjacent to another tile. So you cannot move it on empty space unless it ended there due to the movement of the other tiles.<br/><br/><br/>END GAME &amp; WINNING CONDITIONS<br/><br/>The game will end when one of this two conditions happen:<br/><br/>1) One player starts his/her turn with his target consort surrounded by his own tiles  (perpendicularly).<br/><br/>The victory is total. The more you play the less this condition is going to happen.<br/><br/>2) The players have played all of their tiles.<br/><br/>Once the players have played all of their tiles comes the scoring. For this step only the tiles that surround PERSPERNDICULARLY (up, down and sides) each royal consort will count. Add all the influence numbers in the tiles, PLUS all the tokens if there are INACTIVE tiles among them (each one is worth 1 point) MINUS the total influence on the tiles your opponent has surrounding your royal consort. Compare this numbers... the player with the most influence WINS the game.

He often goes running along the forest paths with his dog Oscar. All the animals in the forest know him. Alex is also a great dreamer. Sometimes he sits under a tree and turns the pages of his favourite book: The Big Farming Book.<br/>He sits there enjoying the sun, cooled by a gentle breeze. On such occasions Alex sometimes falls asleep and dreams of a magnificent farm with cows, funny little hens and affectionate horses. One day, Alex and Oscar went running in a field at the edge of the forest. In the middle of the field stood<br/>a scarecrow to keep the crows away. When Oscar and Alex passed close to the scarecrow they heard a strange noise. Alex was surprised and looked all around, but couldn't see anything strange or unusual. Just as Alex and Oscar were about to continue their race, Alex heard the noise again. It was as if someone was calling him: - Psst! Pssst! Alex, it's me!<br/>It was the scarecrow! Alex couldn't believe his eyes.<br/>- But...! You can speak! said Alex in surprise.<br/>-Yes, of course I can speak, said the scarecrow. But I only speak to children who like animals and nature. Like you, Alex!<br/>The scarecrow had a big smile. He looked nice and funny at the same time. He spoke again:<br/>-You know what Alex? I often see you sleeping under a tree in the forest. Did you know that when you dream in the middle of the forest, your dreams can come true?<br/>- Er... No, I didn't know that, said Alex.<br/>-Well, because you're a good little boy and you love nature so much, I'm going to tell you a secret: when you wake up, all you have to do is concentrate very intensely on your dream and do everything you canto make it come true!<br/>- That's easy! said Alex.<br/>- Yes! But above all, you mustn't forget to have fun! Other<br/>wise, it's no longer a dream!<br/>- Thanks, Mr Scarecrow! That's a great secret!<br/>- Bye, bye!<br/>As soon as Alex had finished talking with the scarecrow, he and Miro ran faster than ever in the direction of a large oak tree, the most majestic tree in the forest. Alex was keen to see if the scarecrow had been telling the truth. He sat down under the tree and shut his eyes.

They may use it at any time in the game to send any train out of the station early (as in immediately the whistle blows). However, if the tile hasn't been used and another player becomes the lowest scorer then they take the tile. The tile may only be used once during the entire game (that is ONCE not once per player) - put it back in the box when it has been used.<br/><br/>Tile #2: The Guard's Flag<br/>This tile may also only be used once per game. It begins on the table next to the train stack. On their turn any player may decide to use the Flag instead of taking their normal turn (ie they do not get to play a carriage or place a passenger chit). The Flag is placed above a train which shows that the train has a fault and cannot be moved. Remove all the passenger chits and return them to their owners, then discard the carriages and the train engine - no one scores this train. After use place the Flag back in the box<br/><br/>Zen Garden: Raked Sand<br/>The two tiles allow a player to remove and replace a previously played tile - except a feature tile with a cube on it already.<br/><br/>This is available in Game Trade Magazine issue #173.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "0", "boardgameversion": {"236681": "English edition 2014"}, "name": "Mayfair Games' Limited Edition Promo Expansion Set #8", "playingtime": "0", "average": "6.8", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "6", "expands": {"150930": {"name": "Mad City"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}}, "157197": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Planet Gobbler", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"236682": "Web browser edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2331": "Space"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"5084": "Web Browser"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Control a giant mouth which consumes planets, but only eat the right color planet!

By learning a trade, each player&rsquo;s daughter can focus and increase her physical attributes to build a foundation for her later career; money she earns by practicing her trade can help pay tuition for schooling to align her skills with her ultimate goal.<br/><br/>By overseeing his or her daughter&rsquo;s training, leisure activities, and diet, each player may choose to steer his or her daughter&rsquo;s progress toward any among the number of endings available exclusively to her in a particular game; but each player&rsquo;s ultimate success depends not on the relative prestige of the career he or she chooses for his or her daughter, but rather on his or her daughter&rsquo;s success in that career: A hunter who knows her trade may do better in life than a princess who cannot inspire the love of her subjects.<br/><br/>Players construct their daughters&rsquo; character decks gradually all year long, building toward the yearly harvest festival, in which each player&rsquo;s daughter can compete against other contestants in a variety of contests to win prestige, prizes, and royal favor. During the festival, players enter any contests of their choosing by selecting hands of cards from their daughters&rsquo; character decks, then playing out those hands of cards against the other players in each contest. Cards won increase each daughter&rsquo;s reputation in her associated skill and raise her likelihood of encountering rivals striving in those same skills during the rest of the year. Cards saved back from the contest form each player&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s character deck for the next year, helping her focus her work and training as she prepares for the next festival and, ultimately, aims at her chosen destiny.<br/><br/>Players who feel confident in their daughters&rsquo; training can go adventuring outside the confines of the capital city in hopes of finding help unavailable through normal means, whether from new acquaintances, after defeating enemies, through fairy meetings, or in undiscovered troves. Those who focus chiefly on schooling can benefit from the benevolence of the various deities who oversee the various mental and physical arts in the kingdom. And those whose skills lend themselves less toward adventuring and training and more toward society can try to find their place in the capital&rsquo;s social life by cultivating helpful relationships among those who live in the palace&mdash;and can eventually aspire to a position among the kingdom&rsquo;s nobility, perhaps even its royalty.<br/><br/>But raising a daughter isn&rsquo;t easy. Keeping her healthy means feeding her well, and both feeding her and training her cost money. Yet the work she does to help earn that money can increase her resentment if she feels too much is being required of her&mdash;if she works or studies too long without time to herself, if she wears herself out adventuring without time vacationing to renew her energy. And if her resentment grows, she may fall into delinquency, may even run away from home without considering the consequences of abandoning her schooling or missing a festival.<br/><br/>So it&rsquo;s up to you to do what you can to shepherd her through the difficulties of growing up, teaching her how to work and how to learn and giving her skills for the life she eventually chooses to live. She may not be grateful at the time, but as you teach her to be moral and industrious, to work hard at getting ahead, she will come, in the end, to be thankful for the discipline you&rsquo;ve helped her maintain during her formative years.<br/><br/>And when she turns 18, your job is over: She is of age, free to follow her own path in life. And you can only hope she feels kindly toward you for the role you played in her upbringing, for the tools you have helped her equip herself with. Because whatever part she chooses to play among those who live in the capital city&mdash;even in the kingdom overall&mdash;it is you who helped give her the chance to choose that path, and you who prepared her to succeed in it. Your parenting skills will be reflected in her success.<br/><br/>A full game of 6-Minute Princess is played in 8 sessions of approximately 1 to 3 hours apiece, depending on the number of players.<br/><br/>"}, "157204": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Sunda", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2676": "Grid Movement"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1975824_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"18655": {"name": "Diana-Spieleverlag Robert Enz"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1975824.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"236690": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The goal of the game ist to get points by enclosing opponent playing pieces.

The problem is that most retro-styled games have very swingy character creation. The beloved Iron Man stat generation system (roll 3d6 in order for each ability) is particularly bad in this regard. &hellip;<br/><br/>DCC&rsquo;s OSR solution is very nifty: It accelerates the building of that character history. Let&rsquo;s outline it briefly: Each player creates four level-0 PCs. Each of these receives a tiny fragment of personality and backstory: A race, profession, and a few meager possessions. You then send these sadsacks through the meat-grinder of a typical D&amp;D dungeon. The few who manage to claw their way from -100 XP to 1 XP attain level one, and get a class and a proper place in the campaign.<br/><br/>The idea, then, is that players learn to love the idiots who survived simply because they&rsquo;re the ones who managed to beat the odds. &hellip;<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a damned great idea.

The face up chip can be the true identity of their played card or a lie to try to trick the other players into believing what they are playing. There is an optional round where players can change the chip on their card to a different one. Then the cards are revealed and the way they interact decides who won the round and receives VP.

Starting player declares a card he will be playing by placing corresponding token face-up, then plays one card face-down. He may lie about the card he's playing. Then next player does the same, and so on. When all players are done, reveal all cards they played and resolve the outcome. If one or more Royalties are in play, each Assassin in play kills one of them. Successful Assassins win the round. After the assassination, if one or more Royalties are still in play, survived Royalties win the round, otherwise all Slaves win the round. Winners get points, and players who have lied and still didn't win the round lose points. A game ends when a player gains total of 8 points.

The edges of the board are also numbered, from 1-4.<br/><br/>The game can be played in two ways.

There are plenty of resources out there, but you have to get to them and survive various encounters and attacks to reach towns that have potential as safe havens. You&rsquo;ll have to plan your route to include spots that have the assets you&rsquo;ll need to stockpile. Some of these spots are controlled by raiders, and you&rsquo;ll have to survive attacks to gain the items you need.<br/><br/>Once you&rsquo;ve scouted locations, you&rsquo;ll have to return to center city for your family and more supplies.  You then pick a location as your final destination. If you can get there with the required supplies and survivors before anyone else, you win the game.<br/><br/>The game dynamic revolves around the management of assets while you are traveling to your destinations. You'll be tempted to use them to gain an edge in an encounter, but you have to stockpile them to be able to win the game. Different gameplay styles and a unique route traveled in each game, coupled with game-changing Bonus cards, make Doom and Bloom SURVIVAL! a fun and challenging game.

But devising a winning strategy will take a more calculated approach than our standard fare. You need to carefully consider what moves can score you well and put your opponents at a disadvantage.

To earn points and win the game, the players attempt to sacrifice Minions from their cult to the Shoggoth (bad news for Minions, but what do you expect when you join an evil cult?). However, the Shoggoth is indiscriminate in who it eats; if you can't feed the Shoggoth on your turn with a Minion, it eats you, and you're out of the game!<br/><br/>During your turn, if the Shoggoth is in front of you, you have the ability to sacrifice on Minion from your hand. The other Cult Leaders at the table can attempt to disrupt your sacrifice by casting spells to move the Shoggoth away from you, stealing Minions from your hand, or any one of many dastardly methods (Rival Cult Leaders are insidious that way).<br/><br/>If the active player is still able to keep the Shoggoth in front of them during their sacrifice phase, the Minion is gobbled up, the player earns a point token, the Shoggoth moves to the player to the left, and the active player draws back up to their hand limit.<br/><br/>The winner is either the first player to reach the victory point goal (determined how many players are participating), or the last player standing.<br/><br/>The theme of the game is based on the works of HP Lovecraft; those players who are familiar with either the stories of HPL and/or the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game will recognize many of the names and terms on the cards. However, this isn't yet another game with the name &quot;Cthulhu&quot; tacked on at the end (and in fact, Cthulhu himself never directly makes an appearance in the game).

Plants is also a modular, organic game system that can grow and adapt beyond a single game board or a set of rules. The game is not meant to be an educational simulation, but more like an open creative project that deliberately intertwines certain biological concepts with suitable board game mechanisms.<br/><br/>During the game, the players continuously move through several different types of phases and perform actions at their own pace. They must try to adapt to the whims of the competing players and manipulate the upcoming situations to help them pollinate their flowers and gather enough nutrients and energy to produce seeds. At same time the players may sprout from the seeds, use the nutrients to grow in the habitat area and be forced to use up their energy to get rid of pesky larvae. Having enough water available is always a concern, and sometimes the players must accept losing their precious biomass. And if the players are not careful, they might even be eliminated from the game completely.<br/><br/>Plants features no randomness after a simple setup and there are no auctions, negotiations or trading. It has an open spatial element with shared resources and some three-dimensional play. The actions are short and the turns go by quickly and the possible butterfly effects keep situations tense. Clever planning and timing is required for success, and in the end only the number of seeds matter.<br/><br/>"}, "157390": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Fast & Furious 6: The Game", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"236983": "Android edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2456": "Driving"}, "videogamegenre": {"2154": "Racing"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamefranchise": {"24874": "The Fast and the Furious"}, "videogameplatform": {"6063": "Android"}, "videogamehonor": {"33222": "2013 CVA Best Game on the Go Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "description": "A mobile game, Fast &amp; Furious 6: The Game, was developed by Exploding Barrel Games and published by studio Kabam.

Bulwark sovereigns believe that their greatest contribution to their allies is to be the shield before the blow, protecting their allies from any incoming harm. With pure hearts and noble ideals, they rush to the forefront of battle or debate, placing the needs of those that they protect before their own. Rare indeed is the bulwark sovereign that fails to stand proud before the might of an enemy, be it on the field of battle or at the negotiating table.<br/><br/>Reverie Templar Psychic Warrior Archetype<br/>The mind is a treacherous landscape within which to wage war, and the reverie templar knows this better than most. Inviting foes into their own minds, they can create the perfect conditions under which to combat their adversaries. It&rsquo;s a dangerous tactic, but one that works to their advantage far more often than not. As they grow in strength, they learn how to project the imagined conditions of their minds out into the world to a limited extent, crafting reality to their whims to influence the tides of battle.<br/><br/>Verdant Metamorph Vitalist Archetype<br/>Most vitalists use their powers to heal, but that is not the only function of their particular talents. There are others that are perfectly capable of changing their own bodies by the force of their own will rather than just repairing the damage caused by others. These verdant metamorphs are far more dangerous than they let on. They often masquerade as druids, keeping mostly to themselves and avoiding other psychics, but there are those that live the life of adventurers and keep company beyond themselves.<br/><br/>Vivere Vitalist Archetype<br/>The vivere is a peculiar sort of being; full to overflowing with living energies that they are able to psychically manipulate in any number of ways. They often display over-the-top behaviors, whether those mannerisms are constructive in nature, or destructive. They are certainly vibrant characters that sometimes mesh very well with groups of adventurers, but some prefer to travel the world alone, living life to the fullest and beyond. Few are those that would come across one of the mysterious vivere and not know that they had met such an exuberant being. Standard vitalists and vitalists of other archetypes do not possess the ability to learn this method.<br/><br/>New Psionics Feats<br/><br/>     Artful Opening: You are able to create a brief weakness that can make you look like an attractive target to your foes, then use that to your advantage.<br/>     Aware Within the Dream: It becomes very difficult to surprise you when you set the rules.<br/>     Controlled Burn: You are able to control some of the abundant life-force that dwells within you.<br/>     Gatesealer: While some others may prefer to bash doors and gates down to gain entry, there are others that prefer to prevent others from passing through them instead.<br/>     Ingenious Repartee: When fighting defensively, you are more adept than most.<br/>     Liberated Senses: Rare are the opponents that can get the drop on you.<br/>     Mettle Plating: When you create your astral forgeform, you are able to increase your defensive mastery.<br/>     Vibrant Pulse: You don&rsquo;t just heal plants. You are also capable of healing animals and allies as well.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>New Psionics Powers<br/><br/>     Mind Thorns: You are able to fling a sharp psychic thorn from your forehead as a ranged touch attack that causes 1d3 points of damage.<br/>     Philosophical Excursion: You send your mind to another plane of existence (an Elemental Plane or some plane farther removed) in order to receive advice and information from powers there.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>BONUS!

Well, it just so happened that last weekend there was a 48 hour mini-jam that coincided with a relatively calm weekend.  I decided to jump in and see about cranking out a game.  Due to some amazing weather I ended up spending about half the weekend outside doing yard work, and worked on this game when I needed a break from the weeds.The theme of the jam was &quot;de-makes&quot; which meant all the participants were invited to re-make a game of their choosing in a low-fidelity, low-tech or otherwise deconstructed format.  After kicking the idea around in my head for a while, I decided to de-make the original Legend of Zelda.  My de-make would be to rebuild the game, but with a viewport of just 16 x 16 pixels.  No interpolation, no cheating, just 16 x 16 blocks of one color each.<br/><br/>To figure out if this crazy idea even made sense, I did some tests in photoshop to make sure the various pages of the world map would fit into the 16 x 16 limit.  Fortunately the Zelda map screens are all a tile grid of 16 x 10 tiles.  This fits nicely into my limit with a few pixels to spare for the status area at the top.  The final content actually fits into a 16 x 14 pixel rectangle, so I beat my limit by 32 pixels!<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "157397": {"poll": {}, "name": "Hippo Hunt Game", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"11627": "Animals: Hippopotamus"}, "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2631960_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1192": {"name": "Hallmark Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2631960.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"236995": "Hippo Hunt"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "4", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "From the package:<br/><br/>Spill the critters<br/>take your pick<br/>find the hippo<br/>Do it QUICK!<br/><br/>The game pieces are 24 plastic animals packaged in a plastic tube.<br/><br/>There are 2 ways to play the game.<br/><br/>- Dump all the animals onto a table.

The town board and whaling board contain basic game actions: taking goods (food, wood, brick), selling goods, building buildings, docking ships, and launching ships. These actions can be used multiple times per round, with the first player to do so in a round receiving a bonus or more goods or reducing the number of goods paid.<br/><br/>Most buildings add extra action spaces with new actions, combined actions, and more powerful versions of basic actions. You own whatever you build, with others needing to pay to use them and you earning points from them at game's end.<br/><br/>You need to pay to send ships whaling, choosing how far out to send them. At the end of the round, ships move closer to shore and whale tokens are drawn randomly. Ships that are farthest out have first chance to pick the valuable sperm whales, but as they move in, others have the opportunity to launch farther out and get a better pick, possibly leaving you with only empty seas.

Once a ship reaches shore, a percentage of the profits (the &quot;lay&quot;) must be paid in order to keep the whales selected.<br/><br/>After twelve rounds, all ships must return, and players total their points from buildings, whales, and extra money.

Then the players alternately make their moves thereafter.<br/><br/>Rules of the Game: This checkers variation is played using an 8 x 8, or 64 squares checker board of light and dark squares and each player has 12 pieces of contrasting colors, usually red and white. The board is placed between the two players in such a way that the double corner is on the right side and a dark colored square is on the left side of each player. The player places his pieces on the first three rows on his side of the board<br/><br/>The Moves of the Men: Checker players can only move their pieces forward one at a time on each empty square to the left or to the right. If a player successfully moves his pieces to the last, or &quot;king row,&quot; then that piece must be crowned &quot;king&quot; by the opponent by placing a second checker on top of the crowned piece.<br/><br/>The Moves of the King: King pieces are &quot;flying kings,&quot; which means that they can move over many empty squares on the diagonal lines that pass over the square on which they are located.<br/><br/>Captures: In Brazilian Checkers captures are mandatory. And, maximum captures are compulsory as well, which means that if a player has more than one way to capture the opposing pieces then he must choose that way that will result in the capture of the most number of pieces. If a checker piece reaches the king row while in a capture sequence, it must keep on capturing pieces backward for as long as there still pieces to capture. That capturing piece cannot be crowned king unless it finishes the move and stops on king row.<br/><br/>Captures by the Men: Men can capture by jumping forward or backward over a single piece that is located next to it only if the square located next to the captured piece is unoccupied. If the man can jump again from its landing square to make another capture, then it must do so because all captures are mandatory.<br/><br/>Captures by a King: A crowned piece can capture an opponent's piece forward and backward diagonally if it is on the same path where it is located and if the squares between them are unoccupied and that if the square immediately after the piece that will be captured is also unoccupied. The crowned piece can land on any empty square within the same path and if a continuous capture is possible, then the player must keep on capturing even if this move will not redound to the best interest of the player making the capture.<br/><br/>The Winning Player: A player wins the game if he has captured all of his opponent's pieces or successfully blocked his opponent's pieces such that the opponent is unable to move any of his pieces.<br/><br/>Conditions for a Draw: The players can mutually agree to a draw. A draw may also happen if the same position has occurred three times during the game, or if there are three crowned pieces playing against one and that both players have made 16 moves without attaining any promotion or making a capture.<br/><br/>Information from checkershistory.com<br/><br/>"}, "157417": {"rpgitemversion": {"237024": "PDF"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Tales From The Crucible", "rpgproducer": {"14473": "Chris Birch"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1978348.png", "usersrated": "2", "rpgsetting": {"21627": "Achtung!

As the Third Reich&rsquo;s war machine prepares to conquer the world and Cthulhu&rsquo;s minions work to undermine all of humanity, these few inspire a host of other courageous souls to rise up in defiance!<br/><br/>The iconic heroes of Achtung! Cthulhu detailed herein&mdash;Professor Richard Deadman, Captain Eric &ldquo;Badger&rdquo; Harris, Ariane Dubois, Natalya Petrova and Corporal Akhee &ldquo;The Eye&rdquo; Singh&mdash;are the subject of many of the pictures, comments and short stories found throughout the books,games and miniatures. This dossier presents a more formal introduction to these notable characters. In 2014 we&rsquo;ll be launching the official Secret War Campaign that will let you take these heroes (or those of your own invention) from their very human roots right through the most famous missions of Section M and Majestic, to a climatic finale in the Achtung! Cthulhu universe. The Secret War Campaign will also include new rules and suggestions for running truly epic adventures against the worst the Third Reich and Cthulhu can muster.<br/><br/>"}, "157418": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Fate Codex (Vol 1, Issue 2 - Mar 2014)", "rpgproducer": {"60282": "John Adamus"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2270812.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"24436": "Fate Codex"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"132374": "About The Fate Codex - Vol 1, Issue 2"}, "rpg": {"203": "Fate Core"}, "rpgissueversion": {"237025": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2270812_t.jpg", "description": "This issue includes articles on skills, on infiltration, and on culture, as well as a quickstart scenario.<br/><br/>"}, "157419": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Wicked Words!

Unbeknownst to the rest of you, one of your friends is secretly a Cultist, eager to sacrifice the rest of you to their dark master.<br/><br/>The Academics must work together to accomplish the goals of the scenario before the stars align and the Cultist is able to pull off their scheme, reveal themselves, and summon a Shoggoth, a flight of Night Gaunts, or reveal themselves to have been a Mi-Go the whole time, to pick three example Cultists from a single scenario, the Fungi from Yuggoth.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds, consisting of each player taking a turn, and then one University Phase. On a turn, a player draws an Event card related to their location, resolves it using a push-your-luck ability check mechanic which forces them to make trade offs between personal harm or harm to the group, and then takes two Actions: Move, Fight, Search, Steal, Trade, Use an Item, or a Scenario specific event. The University Phase consist of moving any monsters that may be on the board, followed by the starting player drawing two University cards, selecting one to play and one to shuffle back into the deck without revealing. These cards are all bad for the Academics, but in different ways and to different degrees, so this is another opportunity for the Cultist to secretly advance their own agenda. The starting player then passes the Starting Player token to their left and a new round begins.<br/><br/>The Academic players are trying to complete their Scenario specific goals before the Cultist kills them. For instance, in the Fungi from Yuggoth scenario, the Academic goals are: A1: assemble a complete Elder Sign, A2: take it to Chapel, B1: find the Necronomicon in the Vault or Library, B2: use it as described on its card. Players gain Elder Sign pieces by successfully completing Events, by searching, or by making them in the Art Department with a Finesse check. Players look for the Necronomicon in the Library with Reason checks, or the Vault with Focus checks. Events also have a chance of advancing the Star Chartz The Academics win if they complete their goals before the last of them is killed, the Cultist wins if they kill all of the Academics. When the Star Chart reaches a certain number, the Cultist may reveal themselves to gain some horrid benefit. For instance, in the Fungi from Yuggoth, all players know that the Cultist is trying to get the Star Chart to either 15 so they can reveal themselves to be a Mi-Go in a human costume, or 20 so they can summon a trio of Night Gaunts, or 25 so they can summon a Shoggoth. All players know these are the options, but only the Cultist knows which one they are actually trying to do.<br/><br/>Cultists of Cthulhu is a big-box, semicooperative, thematic game of mystery, investigation, teamwork, and betrayal. The board is modular, and assembled at the beginning of each game in a rapid-fire, real-time setup. With this very fast, unique map setup, 12 characters, 4 different scenarios, each with multiple possible hidden Cultist goals, Cultists of Cthulhu provides near infinite diversity and replayability.<br/><br/>Featuring an ability check mechanism using custom dice which allows for meaningful decisions every turn, an innovative combat system, dark, suspenseful art, and gripping theme music, Cultists of Cthulhu has been called &quot;possibly the next Arkham Horror.&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"237088": "First edition"}, "age": "14", "name": "Cultists of Cthulhu", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "average": "7.02973", "usersrated": "37", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "157453": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1990416.png", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"26997": {"name": "Jason Tagmire"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": {"74509": "Campbell Whyte"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"26991": {"name": "Button Shy"}}, "boardgameintegration": {"200609": "Storyteller Cards: Fantasy"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1990416_t.png", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Storyteller Cards are a playing card deck, designed to inspire creativity in gamers, role-players, writers, artists, teachers, parents and children.

It&rsquo;s 20 minutes of family fun created by children&rsquo;s book author/illustrator, Eric Wight.<br/><br/>OBJECT OF THE GAME<br/>Combine the highest scoring HEAD card with a BODY card to win the cards for that round. The game winner is the player who collects the most Beasties.<br/><br/>WHO IS BEASTIE BASH! FOR?<br/>Beastie Bash! is for kids with wild imaginations. For families who prefer silly to serious. For parents &amp; educators who think the world needs innovators, not fill-in-the-bubblers.<br/><br/>THE BIRTH OF BEASTIE BASH! <br/>The concept for Beastie Bash! was inspired by Eric Wight&rsquo;s experiences as both a parent and a children&rsquo;s book author. His favorite hobby is playing games with his kids. So he thought it would be fun to create a game they could all play together. But that was just the beginning.<br/><br/>&ldquo;This past year, my daughter was diagnosed with dyslexia. As I was designing Beastie Bash! I realized that this game could also be a fun tool to help her improve her reading and math skills. We can play it for hours and it doesn&rsquo;t feel like homework to her. Plus, by mixing up the cards, the text is continually changing.&rdquo;<br/><br/>As an author, Eric has the opportunity to travel around the world teaching kids what it&rsquo;s like to create stories for a living. At these events, students brainstorm ideas for new adventures, which Eric illustrates on the spot.<br/><br/>&ldquo;The kids always have so many cool ideas that it&rsquo;s tough to choose just one. So I thought it would be fun to mash a few together. I could never have predicted how much it made the students and teachers laugh. I realized I was onto something, and set out to create a game that captured that same creative, unpredictable humor.&rdquo;<br/><br/>RULES OF PLAY<br/><br/>SET UP<br/>2 - 4 players. Shuffle the deck. Evenly divide the cards face down to each player. No peeking!<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/>Each player draws 5 cards from their pile. Pair a HEAD and BODY combination to make the highest score possible and place it in front of you. A color match earns an additional +5 points, a MEGA-MATCH earns +10 points and a &quot;TRUE MATCH&quot; (i.e.: the original head and body combination) earns double points.<br/><br/>POWER PRIZES<br/>Once everyone has revealed their Beastie, players may improve their chance of winning by using a POWER PRIZE card if they possess one. Begin with the player who has the lowest scoring Beastie and continue clockwise. The player with the highest scoring Beastie wins all of the Beasties from this round. Discard the used POWER PRIZE cards.<br/><br/>THE BOOM! CARD<br/>The BOOM! card is very powerful and may be played at any time. When a player uses a BOOM! card, it scares away all of the Beasties. Everyone's cards are discarded no matter what their point value is or what POWER PRIZE cards are being used. Bummer!<br/><br/>TIE-BREAKER<br/>If at the end of the round the score is tied, players may draw enough cards to refill their hand and play another Beastie. Repeat until the tie is broken.<br/><br/>NO PAIRS<br/>If you are unable to make a pair with your cards, you must:<br/><br/>1. Discard 2 cards from your hand.<br/><br/>2a. Use the top 2 cards from your collected Beastie pile.<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>2b. Draw 2 cards from your unused deck. If you draw two cards from your unused deck, you must discard all 5 cards AND lose your turn. At the beginning of the next round you may draw 5 new cards.<br/><br/>ENDING THE GAME<br/>The game ends when the first player runs out of cards. Count how many Beasties you collected. The player with the most wins!<br/><br/>ALTERNATE GAME PLAY<br/>1-player: Similar to a traditional match game. Place all the cards face down. The object is to find the Power Prizes before you find the Boom! cards. Turn them over two at a time to find Power Prizes. Once you find a character match, it can be removed from the board. If you flip over 4 Boom! cards, you lose.<br/><br/>LEVEL-UP WITH LEARNING<br/>Beastie Bash! isn&rsquo;t just fun to play, it&rsquo;s also a great tool for learning both at home and in the classroom.<br/><br/>READING: Each card contains funny flavor text that brings the characters to life. With each new match, the text changes, creating countless new reading experiences.<br/><br/>MATH: Kids practice addition skills as they play each round of the game. Older kids can multiply instead of add to make the math more challenging.<br/><br/>WRITING: Create your own adventures using the mix-and-match cards as writing prompts.<br/><br/>"}, "157478": {"boardgamedesigner": {"74898": {"name": "Troy Pichelman"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Conquest of the Stars", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2676481_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2676481.png", "boardgameversion": {"237140": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Conquest of the Stars is a strategy card game for 2-4 players where the goal is simple: you are out to capture more planets than your opponents. <br/>Of course your opponents are trying to do the same thing, so it's not going to be easy ...<br/><br/>Each turn you draw cards to add to your fleet, then explore to find a planet.

Attack bonuses, hit dice, class skills, spells, and class features have been unified and spread evenly over levels. This means that most prestige archetypes have their prestige abilities spread over the entire 20 level spread. Unlike how prestige classes normally work, these archetypes have a few complete class abilities rather than many abilities limited to a low level. In some cases, you get the choice of one of several class abilities rather than stymied versions of all the abilities.<br/><br/>A prestige archetype generally has elements of one or more regular character classes, to represent how prestige prerequisites were met and character development after the prestige class has ended. Sometimes there is more than one class that naturally leads itself to a particular prestige class, which can lead to several different prestige archetypes for different combinations. A few are not built on a regular class, instead expanding the idea behind the prestige class to a full 20 levels.<br/><br/>"}}
