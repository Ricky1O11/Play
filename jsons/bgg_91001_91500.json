Roberts Best Post-WW2 Era Board Wargame Nominee"}, "description": "Phantom Fury - The 2nd Battle for Fallujah<br/>This solitaire game simulates, at tactical scale, the combat waged by US forces during the month of November 2004 to secure the city of Fallujah and crush insurgent resistance. The game particularly focuses on the fighting of the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division in the Jolan District in the north-west part of the city in the morning of November 9th.<br/><br/>The player controls USMC troops while the system handles the insurgents. This design is based mainly on the article &quot;Infantry Squad Tactics: Some of the lessons learned during MOUT (military operations in urbanized terrain) in the battle for Fallujah&quot;, published in the September 2005 issue  of the Marine Corps Gazette.<br/><br/>The map includes a part of the Jolan District, divided into 61 zones of approximately 50x50 meters and sections of road of equal size. Each zone is made-up of several locations (open ground, courtyard, first storey, second storey, rooftop) represented by boxes that are used to manage movement. Tracks and charts are also on the map edges.<br/><br/>The troops of each side are represented by &lsquo;unit&rsquo; counters, each corresponding to one Marine squad (six to 12 men) or a group of insurgents (about six men each). The total strength of USMC forces is about that of a reinforced company. Each squad has a combat factor that is used to resolve firing and assaults. The attachment of a Combined Anti-Armor Team (CAAT) to a squad increases its combat factor in certain cases. When a USMC squad suffers a step loss during combat, the counter is flipped to its reduced side. If it suffers another loss, the unit is removed from the game (i.e., the squad is no longer operational and the wounded are evacuated to the rear). Insurgent units appear in two distinct types: guerrilla units and martyr units, also each with their own combat factors. Guerrilla units fight USMC troops but withdraw rather than be destroyed. Martyr units, instead, have vowed to die where they stand and kill as many enemies as possible. These units are immobile and, within their fortified positions, await the attacks of USMC forces. At all times, insurgent units are eliminated after suffering one step loss.<br/><br/>Insurgent units do not appear directly on the map. Initially, the player deploys &ldquo;suspect&rdquo; markers which represent a potential, non-identified danger to USMC troops. Their placement is partially random. Once fired upon or assaulted, these &ldquo;suspect&rdquo; markers are activated and their true nature (dummy, guerrilla, martyr, IED, or sniper) is revealed. However, USMC troops can also count on the support and fire power of a pair of M1A2 Abrams tanks. A section of Iraqi soldiers from the Iraqi Intervention Force (IIF) is also available, their mission being the capture of the mosque in Jolan, as the USMC troops do not have the right to enter that zone.<br/><br/>The game lasts a maximum of 16 turns, each representing about 15 minutes of real time. Each turn begins with a variable cycle of USMC support missions. These missions are of three types (reconnaissance by drones &ndash; UAV, close air support by helicopter, and aerial bombardment). Each of these missions can only be conducted a certain amount of times per game, and their execution is not automatic. In case of a mission being cancelled or delayed, the insurgents can temporarily take the initiative and act (reinforcements, withdrawal, counter-attack, etc.). Then, a reinforcement phase allows the player to enter extra troops onto the map at the cost of victory points. Each squad then has the opportunity to fire or move. After conducting movement, the player resolves his assaults against insurgent units that are adjacent to his Marines. Before launching an assault, a squad can detach its security element in order to isolate the zone and prevent any retreat by the enemy. There are three types of assaults in the game, depending on the locations occupied by the belligerents: &lsquo;top-down&rsquo;, &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo;, and normal. Each type has their advantages and disadvantages for the attacker and defender. CAAT support can also use their incendiary explosives to eliminate insurgents that are too strongly entrenched. Also, each assault can be accompanied by a random event which will influence its result. The game turn concludes with a re-organization phase during which the USMC capture of zones and the infiltration by insurgent troops is checked.<br/><br/>At the end of the 16 turns, the player determines his victory level. If all of the zones on the map are not controlled by the USMC, the player loses the game. If at the end of any turn the USMC controls every zone, the player wins the game and calculates his victory points to determine the extent of his victory (major, minor, bitter). A full game can be completed in about four hours.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>&bull; 17x22 map<br/><br/>&bull; 88 &frac12;&rsquo;&rsquo; die-cut counters and 140 5/8&rsquo;&rsquo; counters<br/><br/>&bull;  1 player aid<br/><br/>&bull; 1 die<br/><br/>&bull; Rule booklet<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"81167": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.46075", "name": "Phantom Fury", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "107", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"8164": "Solitaire Wargames"}}, "91011": {"statistics": {}, "name": "True Lies", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"81168": "English/European Mega Drive edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic902403.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2350": "Movie, Book, TV show"}, "usersrated": "3", "average": "6.66667", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4426": "SEGA Genesis"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic902403_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>It's not like he's saving the world or anything.<br/>Oh yes, it is!

At first it was known as the PC-Engine 2&mdash;which was purported to be a true 16-bit system with improved graphics and audio capabilities, not expected to see release until 1990. However the final machine, named SuperGrafx, was released earlier than expected, in late 1989, only provided modestly enhanced graphics over the original PC-Engine, had audio that was the same as the PC-Engine and had no 16-bit CPU, just the same one as the PC-Engine.<br/><br/>The enhancements SuperGrafx does have: compared to the PC-Engine, SuperGrafx has four times the amount of work RAM for the main CPU, a second video chip with its own video RAM, and a priority controller chip that allows the output of both video chips to be combined in various ways. SuperGrafx has support for two independently scrolling background layers, like the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, instead of the PC-Engine's single layer.<br/><br/>The SuperGrafx was not well received, due to a lack of software written to support its enhanced abilities; only seven titles were ever released. There were no CD, SCD, or ACD games written that took advantage of the SuperGrafx platform. Game software was also very expensive, with games approaching 110 USD. However, the SuperGrafx can play PCE HuCards, PCE CDs, PCE Super CDs, PCE Arcade CDs, and the native SuperGrafx HuCards. These titles combined total to a very respectable library of nearly 700 titles.<br/><br/>It is very common misconception that the extra video hardware and capabilities were taxing on the system's CPU, with speculation that this was the reason not many games were developed for the system. Despite having the same CPU as the PC-Engine, it was more than capable of keeping up with the new graphic enhancements, as the majority of the workload was handled by the VDPs.<br/><br/>One accessory of note was the Power Console, designed to add a full flight yoke, throttle and keypad to the SuperGrafx, sliding over the entire console.

A decade later, its Marxists had lost their top leaders and rural sanctuary, its big drug bosses were dead or in prison, and its paramilitaries were negotiating demobilization.  The Government had extended its writ to most of the countryside, restored its popularity, and improved the economy and respect for human rights.<br/><br/>Andean Abyss takes 1 to 4 players into this multifaceted campaign for control of Colombia:  guerrillas and police, kidnapping and drug war, military sweeps and terror.  Each of four factions deploys distinct capabilities and tactics to influence Colombian affairs and achieve differing goals.  Players place and maneuver 160 wooden pieces across a colorful map and exploit event cards that cannot be fully predicted.  Accessible mechanics and components put the emphasis on game play, but Andean Abyss also provides an engrossing model of insurgency and counterinsurgency in Colombia&mdash;smoothly accounting for population control, lines of communication, terrain, intelligence, foreign aid, sanctuaries, and a host of other political, military, and economic factors.<br/><br/>A New Kind of Card-Assisted Wargame<br/> From the award-winning designer of Wilderness War and Labyrinth, Andean Abyss features unique mechanics relating events and operations that guarantee difficult player decisions with each card flip.  Most of the game&rsquo;s 72 events are dual-use, representing alternative historical paths:  players can choose either version of the event or from an array of operations and special faction activities.  Every choice has implications for how the next card will be played.  There is no hand management:  the focus is on the map and on planning for the foreseeable&mdash;and the unforeseeable.  Die rolls are only a small part of game:  the key to victory is not luck but the ability to organize the most effective campaign.<br/><br/>Multiplayer, 2-Player, Solitaire<br/><br/>Andean Abyss provides up to 4 players with contrasting roles and overlapping victory conditions for rich diplomatic interaction.  For 2- or 3-player games, players can represent alliances of factions, or the game system can control non-player factions .  Or a single player as the Colombian Government can take on the leftist FARC, the right-wing AUC, and the narco-trafficking cartels.

It takes roughly 30 minutes to play.<br/><br/>The basic idea is that players are exploring an archipelago in search of islands. The game board consists of a 9&times;9 array of 81 squares, further divided into nine 3&times;3 boxes. There are 18 islands total, but these islands aren&rsquo;t distributed randomly; instead, they are arranged so that two islands occupy each 3&times;3 box, each row, and each column.  What's more, these islands are initially hidden from view.<br/><br/>Players claim one square per turn.  A player either places an island of her color in the region (if there's an island there) or a boat of her color in the region (if there isn't).  Players are trying first to discover and then to connect together as many islands as they can:  the more islands they connect together, the more points they receive at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Players use logic to determine where the islands are likely to be, but logic alone is not enough:  players must also think tactically and strategically in order both to foster their own growth and limit the growth of their opponents.<br/><br/>ScatterLand takes no more than five minutes to learn (or to teach), but its gameplay is surprisingly deep.  There are a lot of things to try to balance when deciding where to play:  do you want to claim a new island as your own or try to connect two of your islands together?  Do you want to try to consolidate your own position or be the first to explore a given area? Do you want to focus on expanding your chains or trying to cut off your opponents?<br/><br/>Two versions of the game are included:  the basic version (described above) and the advanced version (which limits the number of exclusive islands any one player can claim).<br/><br/>ScatterLand can be found at <a target='_blank' href='http://boardgameforge.wordpress.com/scatterland/' rel='nofollow'>http://boardgameforge.wordpress.com/scatterland/</a> -- just click the links toward the bottom of the page for both the rules and 20 additional boards.<br/><br/>"}, "91096": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic901659.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"10604": {"name": "Kris J.

It runs on Namco Phozon hardware and was only known as Gaplus in Japan. A modification kit was distributed later that changed the title screen to Galaga 3\u200b (\u30ae\u30e3\u30e9\u30ac3) to increase recognition among fans of the Galaga series and boost sales.<br/><br/>Finding this game for home video game consoles is very difficult. It appears on some multi-game cartridges, which were released long after its arcade release. The reason it didn't have a home conversion for so long is due to the Video Game Crash of 1983. It was released on the PlayStation in 1996 as one of the games featured in Namco Museum Volume 2, using its original name &quot;Gaplus.&quot; It was released on mobile phones with its &quot;Galaga 3&quot; title. It is part of Namco Museum Remix for the Wii, which was released in 2007. The original version was re-released under its original name, for the Wii Virtual Console Arcade on March 25, 2009, at a cost of 500 Wii Points<br/>Gaplus is a sequel to Galaga and has similar gameplay. However, it has a much steeper learning curve and much deeper[citation needed] gameplay in later levels. The player controls a spaceship, that can now move vertically (limited to halfway up the screen) as well as horizontally, and shoots at swarms of incoming insect-like aliens which fly in formation above it and swoop down to bomb it in a kamikaze-like dive. In this sequel, the level starts over if the player is killed before all the enemies have come in. When all enemies are destroyed, the player moves on to the next level. By obtaining certain power-ups, it is possible to shoot 60 bullets per screen, the most any Galaga related game has.<br/><br/>The game differs from its predecessor in several ways:<br/><br/>By shooting at a shooting star that occasionally appears, the player can get a ship with new graphics that can have three shots on screen instead of two. After this, shooting the star will make a special flag appear from the Namco game Rally-X that awards an extra life when collected. Also, a glitch was found: at the start of Parsec 1, the player can move the ship up the screen until it stops and let the ship sit there without shooting anything until the enemies have all come in. After the shooting star passes by, the player can shoot the second Gaplus from the left in the bottom row of the formation without hitting other enemies. The Special Flag then appears, and when the Queen Gaplus flies down, the player can run into her (but not into the powerup)and the regular fighter will turn into another ship that fires 1 shot on screen when it is supposed to fire three.<br/>There are two special types of stages besides the normal levels called parsecs. These are levels where the starfield reverses and enemies come in waves, and then leave. After this, a small force comes in like a normal stage. The challenging stages are very different from the original. Enemies are juggled by shots, each hit slowly spelling out &quot;Bonus&quot;, &quot;Gaplus&quot;, &quot;Double&quot; or &quot;Triple&quot; for a bonus and additional hits scoring 200 points each. It is most effective to use the red and blue powerups to repeatedly hit them.<br/>The Queen Gaplus sometimes drops one of several types of powerups when destroyed. She is the most colorful of the aliens and flies to the top of the alien formation. The red powerup captures enemies with a tractor beam where each one provides another shot. The blue powerup gives wider and faster shots. The green powerup captures enemies in a tractor beam that can then be shot for bonus points. The purple powerup changes the screen to a vertical orientation. All of these powerups may be stacked on top of one another, greatly increasing the player's maximum firepower, compared to the dual ship configuration of Galaga, which is absent in this game. Also, it may also carry a third of a ship that will be kept track of at the lower-right of the screen between games. An extra life is awarded when all three are collected.<br/>After Parsec 10, the enemies become green-and-blue colored and look like Galaxians. When destroyed, they each drop a bluish particle that kills the player's ship if it hits it.<br/><br/>Gaplus can be played by a single player or by two players alternating turns. The factory settings start the player out with three lives, a bonus life at 30,000 points, 70,000 points, and every 70,000 thereafter on the easiest level of play. These settings can be changed via DIP switches on the game's motherboard.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Gaplus,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "91135": {"videogame": {"92065": "Namco Museum Battle Collection"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Grobda", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogameversion": {"81453": "JP Arcade edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1554624.png", "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2314": "Arcade"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"92065": "Namco Museum Battle Collection"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1554624_t.png", "description": "Grobda (\u30b0\u30ed\u30d6\u30c0\u30fc, Gurobud\u0101) is a multi-directional shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1984. It is a spin-off from Xevious, as the player's tank first appeared in that - as an enemy.<br/><br/>The player controls a tank in an arena filled with numerous indestructible obstacles - and several enemies such as tanks. When the player kills an enemy, it will cause an explosion and other enemies that happen to be in the way at the time will share the same fate as the first one. But if the player's tank is too close to the explosion it will also be killed. The player's tank has a shield that offers temporary protection from enemy fire, but constant firing from enemies will make it disappear. Each level is called a &quot;battling&quot;, and there are 99 in total. If all 99 battlings are beaten the high score table will show that you have beaten 100 battlings.

You control a pair of paddles that slide horizontally across the screen, and there are rows of blocks to break.<br/><br/>A similar (most likely unauthorized) game called Pinball Spectacular was released by Commodore for the VIC-20 and Commodore 64 home computers. The VIC-20 version features a board layout almost identical to Cutie Q (even including the ghost rollover), while the C64 version is slightly altered, including some aspects of the board for Bomb Bee (most notably, the bumpers in the top corners), and replaces the ghost rollover with a Commodore logo.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutie_Q,&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutie_Q,&quot</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "91139": {"rpgitemversion": {"81459": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Killing the Messenger", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1105710.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"196": "Forgotten Realms"}, "rpgproducer": {"21880": "Pieter Sleijpen"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"190": "Dungeons & Dragons (4th Edition)"}, "average": "0", "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"39622": "CORE - Living Forgotten Realms Core Adventures"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1105710_t.jpg", "description": "From the front of book:<br/><br/>An ancient drow city, long thought dead, has begun to stir and a battalion of Zhentarim soldiers marches to support it.

When she touches a cyclone icon or spins by herself, she can become Wonder Momo and can also attack using the Wonder Hoop, which can be reused as long as she is Wonder Momo. After the Wonder Hoop is thrown, she won't be able to throw anymore, while she'll have to wait for it to bounce back to her.

If the players completes round 48, the game will say the player is still on round 48. The level select in Namco Museum Battle Collection still goes higher than 48.

All of this can be enjoyed in seamless online and split-screen local multiplayer, as players cooperate and compete through the story campaign and challenge missions to build the strongest heroes and achieve the highest scores in the kingdom.<br/><br/>Combining the depth of strategic gaming with the satisfying action of RPG character building, in a beautifully stylized &lsquo;toon fantasy setting, Dungeon Defenders is designed to be a distinctly addictive, easy-to-play experience for casual and hardcore gamers alike!<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "91269": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Amidar", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogameversion": {"84956": "Atari 2600 Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic907870.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2455": "Abstract"}, "usersrated": "9", "average": "4.77778", "videogamegenre": {"2407": "Maze"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic907870_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>An abstract maze game.

Advertised as &quot;The Fastest, Most Realistic Baseball Game in the World,&quot; it uses a plastic ballpark with a &quot;pitcher,&quot; &quot;batter,&quot; and &quot;catcher.&quot; The batting player uses the &quot;batter&quot; (a small metal bat attached to a spring that swings like a bat when a button is pushed) to hit a small metal ball from the &quot;pitcher&quot; (a set of three levers controlled by the pitching player that pitches the ball toward the plate and controls it) before it lands in the &quot;catcher&quot; (a pit behind home plate.)<br/><br/>If the ball is put into play, it may land in a cup, stay in the ballpark, go foul, or be hit outside. Various cups are labeled as to the result, which may be an out or an extra-base hit. If the ball is still inbounds but not in a cup, it is a single. If it leaves the ballpark, then it is a homerun.<br/><br/>The controls of the pitcher allow the ball to be shot forth at varying speeds, moved with a magnet beneath the playing field, and dropped through a trapdoor so the batter is unable to hit it. The game rules describe six different &quot;pitches&quot; that can be thrown: a fastball, change-up, curveball, screwball, slider, and sinker. The game revolves around this element of the pitcher/hitter struggle. While it is very difficult to hit any pitch but a fastball or change-up, if the batter does not swing at anything else it is a ball, as in baseball.

The game was created around the mid 16th century (presumably by priests) and is based on earlier large board shogi games. Before the rediscovery of Taikyoku Shogi in 1997, Tai Shogi was believed to be the largest playable chess variant (if not board game) ever. It has not been shown that Taikyoku Shogi was ever widely played. One game may be played over several long sessions and require each player to make over a thousand moves.&quot; - Wikipedia<br/><br/>Two players, Black and White, play on a board ruled into a grid of 36 ranks (rows) by 36 files (columns) with a total of 1,296 squares. The squares are undifferentiated by marking or color. Each player has a set of 402 wedge-shaped pieces of 209 different types. All pieces are the same color. The orientation of the piece tells which side it is on. The pieces are wedge-shaped with the name of the piece written in kanji on it's face in black. If the piece can promote, then the name of the piece's promoted form is written on the back face, usually in red. Pieces are turned over when promoted.<br/><br/>An opposing piece is captured by displacement: That is, if a piece moves to a square occupied by an opposing piece, the opposing piece is displaced and removed from the board. A piece cannot move to a square occupied by a friendly piece. Unlike standard Shogi, pieces may not be dropped back into play after being captured.<br/><br/>Like other large board Shogi variants, this game uses the promotion-by-capture rule. When a piece first makes a capture, it promotes if it can (this is compulsory, not optional). few important pieces do not promote. Promotion has the effect of changing how a piece moves.<br/><br/>The players alternate making a move, with Black moving first. A move consists of moving a single piece on the board and potentially displacing (capturing) an opposing piece, promoting that piece if it is able to promote.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to capture the opponent&rsquo;s King and Crown Princes, of which players start with one of each. Both pieces must be captured to win. Also present is a piece called the Drunken Elephant, which if promoted becomes another Crown Prince which would also need to be captured to win.<br/><br/>A player who makes an illegal move loses immediately. (This rule may be relaxed in casual games.)<br/><br/>"}, "91366": {"poll": {}, "name": "Let's Go", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1958", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"5597": "Celebrities: Walt Disney"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic907454_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"15962": {"name": "Ontex Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic907454.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"81977": "FIrst Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1064": {"name": "Movies / TV / Radio theme"}}, "age": "4", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Simple race game.

Choose from 24 of the greatest tennis champions in history and pit them against each other in a fun, fast-paced game that isn&rsquo;t packed full of tables and charts. Instead, the entire game is designed to get you thinking about strategy right from the first strike of the ball. Each player in the game is rated for various Strokes such as 1st Serve, Backhand, Forehand Volley and Touch, from a low of F (a terrible shot for a pro player), to AA (one of the legendary Strokes in tennis history). Play Strategy cards to increase your scoring chances, defend against your opponent&rsquo;s Strokes, or try a variety of Tactics (Crowd the Net, Pick up the Pace, etc.) to shake things up.<br/><br/>The fun comes not only from the wide variety of Strategy cards in play at any particular time, but also from the effects different cards have on each other. Do you risk hitting a Cannonball Serve, knowing that your opponent might have secretly played a card that negates it? Can you keep using Go for the Lines as a Tactic, knowing that you might miss, and hurt your scoring chances? And depending on which players are involved, the strategic decisions each set only multiply. As you master the Basic game and move on to the Intermediate and Advanced games, we add the possibility of a Set ending earlier, more Random Events, Tiebreakers, and even Fatigue and Injuries, for those who want more realism, without much increase in complexity.<br/><br/>Stage your own tournaments, find out which courts best fit your style, and serve up some of the greatest Strokes the world has ever seen!

The game has often been inaccurately attributed to Richard Merrill, the designer of FOCAL. Once a version of BASIC was released for the PDP-8, David H. Ahl ported it to BASIC. The game spread beyond mainframes when Ahl published an expanded version of it in BASIC Computer Games, the first best-selling computer book. The expanded version was renamed Hamurabi [sic] and added an end-of-game performance appraisal. This version was then ported to many different microcomputers.<br/><br/>Like many BASIC games of the time, Hamurabi was mainly a game of numeric input. As the ruler, the player could buy and sell land, purchase grain and decide how much grain to release to his kingdom.<br/><br/>The end-game appraisal compared the player to historical rulers (e.g., &quot;Your heavy-handed performance smacks of Nero and Ivan IV.&quot;), a tradition carried on by many contemporary strategy games.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Hamurabi,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "91394": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic904599.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"44278": {"name": "Jeanie Gadish"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"11846": "Barbara Spelger"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"267": {"name": "999 Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic904599_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"18999": "2011 Japan Boardgame Prize U-more Award Nominee"}, "description": "Haim Shafir and Jeanie Gadish's RinglDing takes speedy pattern-recognition games to a fashionable new level.<br/><br/>To set up the game, players place a bell in the center of the table, shuffle a deck of cards, and lay out 72 elastic hair bands within reach of all the players.

Now the rumour has reached Stazhia that the witch seeks to lift a dimensional barrier known as the Veil, which separates the game's universe from chaotic Nether Reaches, and each day brings her closer to creating a permanent portal through the Veil to allow the demon lord to traverse into the Prime Realms and rule the world.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Witchaven&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "91407": {"boardgamedesigner": {"11346": {"name": "Mark Ainsworth"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Dam Breakers", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "7", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic907927_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"11346": "Mark Ainsworth"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic907927.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"82135": "Print and Play Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"2650": {"name": "Aviation / Flight"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Print and Play dice game of dam busting in WW2.

If he has three, he exchanges his blunder tokens for the &quot;mega-blunder&quot; card, which prevents him from getting a &quot;Signed Contracts&quot; card or using the photocopier.

It was the first major battle of the Hundred Years War, and although it was a naval encounter &ndash; the English fleet attacked their French adversaries in the estuary before Bruges &ndash; it was decided by sword, hammer and arrow. Confined to cog and barge, retreat was not an option for marines in this desperate fight. Despite being outnumbered and in foreign waters, the English fleet annihilated its adversary. Edward captured nearly all his rival&rsquo;s ships and slew a horde of soldiers and mariners that day, boasting that bodies were washing onto Flemish beaches for days.<br/><br/>Designed by Jeremy White, this is an unusual game. Players &ldquo;build&rdquo; the battlefield as they go. By navigating their squadrons of galleys, nefs and cogs through the estuary they create the &ldquo;terrain&rdquo; upon which the knights and men-at-arms will vie for supremacy. Success hinges on the ability to deliver marines and archers against weak points, or in giving your opponent no choice but to hit your fleet where it is strongest. The English will have the longbow and a high freeboard, as well as the benefit of the wind gauge in many scenarios, but if played smartly the French will manage to offset those advantages, applying his weight of numbers irresistibly against the English king&rsquo;s bid to rule France. Scenarios treat the variety of questions that puzzle historians about this battle, and since the game is not complex and plays under three hours, it offers a chance to explore many angles of historical interpretation.<br/><br/>Right Fierce &amp; Terrible has one 22 by 34 inch map, oversized die cut counters, accessible rules with extensive illustrated examples of play, and seven scenarios with set-up diagrams for a quick start. Regardless of the scenario played, however, casualties will be horrendous, and there are tough decisions to make. Archery, ramming, grappling and melee are the tools of conquest here. The battle is likely to ebb and flow, squadrons can be captured, liberated, and captured again. Leaders, including King Edward, can also be captured and liberated, or killed by a stray arrow, or if nabbed, executed on the spot. Would Edward&rsquo;s demise have spared Flanders and France one hundred years of war? Knights can perform acts of heroism to avert disaster, but at great cost to themselves. Each fleet&rsquo;s morale will gradually deteriorate as the battle grows more desperate&hellip;until at last, one fleet finally breaks and the day is won!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"82199": "First edition"}, "age": "0", "name": "Right Fierce & Terrible: Sluys 1340", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "average": "7.08065", "usersrated": "31", "boardgamefamily": {"134": "Magazine: Against The Odds"}}, "91439": {"rpgitemversion": {"82200": "Softcover Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Den f\u00f6rbjudna staden", "rpgproducer": {"10886": "Johan Anglemark"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic906121.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"1890": "Mutant 2089"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpggenre": {"164": "Science Fiction (Cyberpunk)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic906121_t.jpg", "description": "Back of the book (User translation in shortened form)<br/>Shanghai, the pearl of Asia, since 20 year occupied by Tokyos, Paris and Bombays mightiest super corporations.

It is the semi-official sequel to the acclaimed Neo Geo shooter Pulstar, which was itself a close cousin to the R-Type franchise. A typically hefty Neo Geo ROM at 346 Mb, the game makes extensive use of pseudo-3D prerendered sprites, brief anime and CGI cutscenes (mostly during the intro sequence), and frequent Engrish voice samples and captions. While Blazing Star was superior in many respects to previous shooter games, some fans compare it unfavorably with Pulstar on the basis that Blazing Star was overly easy and there are those that prefer the simpler 2D sprite look over the prerendered sprites that came to dominate many of the more recent shoot-em-ups.<br/><br/>The joystick and two buttons are used to play Blazing Star. The joystick moves the ship around, while button A fires the normal shot. If A is tapped rapidly, then a variation on the normal shot is used. If A is held down, then the ship stores energy for a charged shot, which is fired when A is released. The charged-shot attacks have a duration based on how long the A button is held for, and pressing B during the attack will split the projectile in some way, greatly increasing the range.<br/><br/>Power-ups can increase the strength of the player's guns, while also increasing the maximum power of the charged shot.

Each player will attempt to establish a sector of his own while thwarting his opponent's efforts. Each player will be rewarded for the size of his sector, as well as the number of groups and bounded disks he can contain within his sector. Some players may even form more than one sector.

A sector is a range of numbered spaces with no disks of an opponent within, and bounded by 2 of the player&rsquo;s disks. Players also score victory points for friendly disks within their sectors. Finally, players score points for groups of 2 or more of their own playing pieces in contiguous spaces.<br/><br/>The player with the most victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>Scoring<br/>Sectors: Score 1 point for each numbered space of the range. A range is always the largest possible area bounded by the pieces of a single color.<br/><br/>Bounded Pieces: Score 1 point for each interior disk within a sector. Bounded pieces never define a range.<br/><br/>Groups of 2: 1 point per piece. The two pieces must be contiguous.<br/><br/>Groups of 3 or more: 2 points per piece. Groups must be contiguous.<br/><br/>Scoring Example: White has pieces in 6 night, 7 day, 9 day, 12 day, 13 night. There are no pieces belonging to opponents in any spaces between 6-13. White will score 8 points for their sector. White will score 3 points for Bounded Pieces (7, 9, 12). White will score 2 points for the group of two pieces that are contiguous (12 day &amp; 13 night). Note that 6 night and 7 day are not contiguous, and therefore do not score as a group.

It is considered by some as a quasi-'sequel' to Time Killers. The game had a rather dark storyline as there were few ambiguously good characters as the other ranged from being sociopathically insane or deceptive folk.<br/><br/>BloodStorm was dubbed as a possible &ldquo;MK-killer&rdquo; in an attempt to further rival Midway's success with Mortal Kombat, though did not prevail. It was the last game Strata produced before the company went out of business.<br/><br/>As with its predecessor Time Killers, BloodStorm features many of the aspects carried down from it, such as the removal of an opponent&rsquo;s arms and an &lsquo;instant kill&rsquo; attack, as well as a Special Death Move. The button layout is virtually the same. They are labeled as &quot;back leg&quot;, &quot;front leg&quot;, &quot;back arm&quot; and &quot;front arm&quot; respectively. A button in the center is used to make the character block. As one would suspect, if a particular limb is lost in combat, its corresponding button is rendered useless.<br/><br/>BloodStorm is also a weapons-based fighter, though it differs from Time Killers in that the characters use weapons called &quot;Gauntlets&quot; that also allow them to use particular powers and attacks with them. Other than being able to bash off an opponent&rsquo;s arms, a technique called a &lsquo;Sunder&rsquo; is also in the game. If executed when an opponent is stunned, it will destroy their lower body. The character will not be able to jump or use kicks, but can still move back and forth a little with the leg buttons.<br/><br/>Even after a successful Sunder attack, the fight can still go on, given the character&rsquo;s life bar is not totally drained yet. However, if both limbs are lost afterwards (given they weren't already torn off prior to the Sunder attack) then s/he is completely helpless. Characters are restored back to normal form after a round is over much like Time Killers as well.<br/><br/>A notable feature in the game is that when an opponent is defeated, the player gains a &lsquo;passable power&rsquo; much like in a style akin to the Mega Man series. These powers or weapons can be used at any time to give the player a further advantage. Also, players can save their progress in a game with a password feature by pressing buttons during the player select screen. However, since the data was saved only until the machine was turned off, it was less than beneficial unless used to pick the game back up where it ended.<br/><br/>Main characters<br/>Hellhound - The fiercest fighter and general of the Fire people of the Southern Province. He takes pleasure in making war with their mortal enemies, the Ice people, Freon in particular.<br/><br/>Freon - Leader of the Ice people in the Northern Province. While he is a noble man, Freon loathes Hellhound and the Fire people, and wants to destroy them. In the end however, he proves to be less than noble as he begins a reign of terror along with a life of decadence and decay.<br/><br/>Tempest - The daughter of the High Emperor who was murdered before the events leading up to the BloodStorm contest. She has the ability to use the winds for her attacks and feels she is the rightful heir to the throne. According to her ending, she is the mastermind behind her father's death.<br/><br/>Razor - A suave and handsome man who was once in love with Tempest, and at the time the feeling was mutual. But her advisers framed him and had him imprisoned and given to Talon, who performed cybernetic experiments on him just before he escaped.<br/><br/>Tremor &ndash; The strongest and wisest of a race of people known as Earthians. He has become aware of the destruction going on between the races, and has tried to negotiate with various provinces to get it to stop, but has been unsuccessful. He sees the BloodStorm contest as a chance to destroy the sickness and disease and bring a much needed cure to the planet.<br/><br/>Mirage &ndash; The leader of a cannibalistic amazon race who live in a harsh desert in the province of Obsel, having overtaken the male population in many ways. Her plans are to lead her people out of their world and take over the whole planet through the BloodStorm tournament. Her gauntlets can fire deadly grenade bombs at her foes.<br/><br/>Talon &ndash; A cybernetic warrior whose steel heart makes him a cold and cruel ruler of Cyberia. He also tortured and performed experiments on Razor, who managed to survive. Originally aiming to find a cure for the disease destroying cell tissue, he eventually grew to see those of flesh and bone as inferior, and aims to convert all into cyborgs.<br/><br/>Fallout &ndash; A mysterious warrior who emerged from a radioactive part of the planet known as &ldquo;The Death Zone&rdquo;, who wanted to fight in the tournament, his reasons unknown for the most part.<br/><br/>Main bosses<br/>Sin<br/>Chainsaw<br/>Nekron<br/><br/>Secrets<br/>BloodStorm is also notorious for having a surprisingly large amount of hidden secrets for an arcade game. Among these secrets are a large amount of taunt codes (a few of which parody Midway and Mortal Kombat in particular, like one that mocks the &quot;Goro Code&quot; rumor of MK II), &quot;big head&quot; characters featuring the game's programmers (which was derived from NBA Jam), special screens that allow you to fight the hidden secret agents, &quot;taxi&quot; codes (which throw the players into another background), morph codes (which let you change your character), gauntlet codes (changes a character's gauntlet to someone else's), and even vulgar &quot;trash talk&quot; codes. There were also a few backgrounds that were somewhat interactive, and such backgrounds are keys to finding the hidden opponents within the game.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;BloodStorm&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "91496": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Blasteroids", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"84990": "Amiga edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1549990.png", "videogameseries": {"9623": "Asteroids"}, "videogametheme": {"2331": "Space"}, "usersrated": "4", "average": "7.05", "videogamegenre": {"2167": "Shooter"}, "videogameplatform": {"4415": "Amiga"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1549990_t.png", "description": "Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Blasteroids&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>Blasteroids is one of the sequels to the original 1979 shoot 'em up video game Asteroids.

Human also released a wrestling game outside the Fire Pro Wrestling series in 1989 for Game Boy. Titled Pro Wrestling in its native Japan, it was released internationally as HAL Wrestling.<br/><br/>The series became popular in Japan, but did not see an international release until after Spike took over the franchise in 2000. Early games in the Fire Pro Wrestling series were popular outside of Japan with import gamers, and at least one game, Super Fire Pro Wrestling X Premium for Super Famicom, received an unofficial fan translation through video game console emulators. Fire Pro Wrestling A for the Game Boy Advance was released internationally as Fire Pro Wrestling in 2001, and was one of the titles initially available when the Game Boy Advance was launched in Japan and North America. Three editions of the game received official English translations: Fire Pro Wrestling (2001) and Fire Pro Wrestling 2 (2002) for the GBA, and Fire Pro Wrestling Returns for PS2 (2007).<br/><br/>While other wrestling games made the transition to using 3-D polygonal models when 32-bit consoles arrived, Fire Pro Wrestling relies on 2-D sprites to represent the characters in the ring. Spike also has another wrestling game series in full 3-D, King of Colosseum.<br/><br/>"}, "91499": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Blade Master", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"82284": "NA Arcade edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1574952.png", "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2342": "Beat 'em Up"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"230760": "Irem Arcade Hits"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1574952_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Side scrolling hack-and-slash and fighting game.
