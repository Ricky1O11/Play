It is the sixth beat 'em up by Irem after Kung-Fu Master, its successors and Undercover Cops.<br/><br/>The game allows up to four players to play simultaneously. Each player chooses from among four characters. The object of the game is to recover various artifacts stolen from the Baseball Hall of Fame, a task prescribed to them by the Commissioner of Baseball. Each stage takes place in several parts of the United States, while a boss character will appear at the end of each stage, which requires player(s) to defeat it. Like in most video games, whether the player fails or successfully beats the game, he or she will type in three letters or other text characters in to record their score.<br/><br/>Like Irem's previous beat 'em up arcade Undercover Cops, Ninja Baseball Bat Man features playable characters with several different fighting moves performed by inputting several commands using an 8-way joystick and two buttons (attack and jump), including &quot;smart bomb&quot; or &quot;screen zapper&quot; moves that sacrifices health in order to annihilate every enemy on the screen. The game also allows players to perform combos, throws and dash attacks against several enemies. When a player's health bar flashes red, more moves can be performed as long as the player doesn't restore or completely lose health. There are items throughout the game that include American and Japanese food for restoring health, alternate weapons such as baseballs and shurikens, or items that call cheerleaders to either obliterate enemies on screen or drop a large amount of food. There are also mini-games after each boss before the final one is defeated<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Ninja Baseball Bat Man&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "94525": {"videogame": ["ADK Tamashii"], "poll": [], "name": "Ninja Commando", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Arcade Edition", "US Neo Geo Edition", "Wii Virtual Console Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1560013.png", "videogametheme": ["Martial Arts", "Military"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["ADK"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade", "Scrolling", "Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade", "Neo Geo", "Wii"], "average": "7", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SNK Corporation"], "videogamecompilation": ["ADK Tamashii"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1560013_t.png", "description": "Ninja Commando (\u30cb\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30b3\u30de\u30f3\u30c9\u30fc) is a top-down, vertically-scrolling run and gun video game developed by Alpha Denshi and published by SNK.

Perhaps it is the viability of the technology. The age of the artificial heart is already upon us. Can a super-powered artificial limb be far behind? Perhaps it is the question raised about the very nature of humanity. Films such as Blade Runner and Aliens have explored this question eloquently, even as they entertain. Perhaps it&rsquo;s just the &ldquo;X&rdquo; factor, the &ldquo;Wow&rdquo; factor, the &ldquo;Cool&rdquo; factor, or whatever other name you want to give it.<br/><br/>A &ldquo;hardwired&rdquo; cyborg can be accomplished with the standard M&amp;M rules easily enough.

However, it stands to reason that, if my Black &amp; Decker power drill can accept 27 different attachments, my cyborg should have a little versatility as well. That&rsquo;s the concept behind modular cybernetics. It&rsquo;s the science that permits various cybernetic implants to be changed in and out as needed.<br/><br/>What&rsquo;s the point? Imagine a top-secret governmental assault team comprised of the most advanced cyborgs on the planet. Need them to infiltrate the Russian mafia&rsquo;s headquarters in Siberia? No problem. Swap in implants that let them speak Russian and ward off the cold. Need them to recover an errant nuclear warhead, sitting on the ocean floor? Piece of cake. Outfit them with implants that let them swim at great speed and ignore the immense pressure of deep water. Daughter of a U.S. Ambassador kidnapped by a drug kingpin and held captive in the Andes?

In order to get you started on you adventures in this original campaign setting there are a few things that need to be established. What follows is a fairly detailed accounting of the continent of Mythe, most particularly the kingdom of Midland. Others powers are touched upon and will be expanded in greater detail in later releases, but for now Midland will be our home.<br/><br/>There is a literal glut of D20 products and campaign settings on the market today, so what makes Mythe unique? To start with, the land area involved is comparatively small, say, about the size of Australia. This was done to initially limit the scope of the amount of land the author needs to cover and to provide a more intimate setting. Secondly, while the Gods of Mythe are in integral part of the game, they are not a focus. In fact, there are only nine named Gods in Mythe, one for each alignment. While this has created some unique challenges in balance and variety, the end result is ultimately more satisfying than a pantheon full of the same archetypes seen in every setting. Lastly, the high magic/low magic debate has been left intentionally vague and is something that each DM will be able to decide for himself.<br/><br/>Mythe is a young continent with humans arriving on her shores only three centuries before. The intervening years have been full of strife and civil war, but nothing compares to the events of the last ten years. The two major powers on the continent, the Midlanders and the Cyndarin have been forced to coexist after a natural disaster rendered the eastern portion of the continent uninhabitable and killed off the bulk of her population. To get an idea of the mood here, imagine the basic premise of Star Trek VI (the initial inspiration for Mythe, if only on a minimal level). The destruction of Quonos and the threat of having to evacuate the Klingon Empire was initially met with shock and fear. While later Trek stories obviously negated this issue, the initial thought was, &ldquo;What if the Klingons DID become the &lsquo;alien trash of the galaxy?&rsquo;&rdquo; What if the Empire was emptied of her citizens and were forced to coexist with their blood enemies? How could the two powers possibly set aside all of their hate and distrust and do what they must to survive? Mythe explores these issues and more.<br/><br/>This work follows the basic information and guidelines for a fantasy settling laid down in the D20 SRD. Other works can be easily incorporated as the individual player sees fit. Prestige or variant classes should integrate well into a setting as varied as Mythe and should be customized for individual tastes. Gunpowder and firearms are not available on the continent as of yet, though as you will read there is an entire unexplored world outside the borders of Mythe that has been lost in antiquity. If you want an ironclad representing a lost elven kingdom to steam up the Mosby River or a Manduka horde to sweep across the northern border armed with musketry then that is your call.<br/><br/>"}, "94620": {"videogame": ["Mile High Club"], "poll": [], "name": "Wing Commander: Academy", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["UK/FR/DE DOS Edition", "US DOS Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic941024.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Wing Commander"], "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "4", "videogamedeveloper": ["Origin Systems Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Flight Simulator"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS"], "average": "5.5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Origin Systems Inc."], "videogamecompilation": ["Mile High Club"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic941024_t.jpg", "description": "Wing Commander Academy built on the Wing Commander II engine.<br/><br/>From back of the box<br/><br/>As a student at the TCSN Academy, you custom-design and fly unique combat, rescue, and search and retrieval missions from the CyberSchool's holographic simulator.

Players lead their armies across a battlefield to clash with their opponent, employing hand management, resource allocation and battlefield strategy to outwit each other. Players deploy troop cards to a grid battlefield and pay tactical points to move, attack and cast spells. Skills and Spells are taught to a player's entire army and reused each turn. Each player chooses from a selection of victory conditions and must achieve three victory conditions to win the match.<br/><br/>The first chapter of Conquest Tactics features three army factions, but troops from different factions may be combined into one deck. The initial factions are:<br/><br/><br/>    Humans: A balanced faction with a wide variety of Spells and Skills<br/>    Kaborha: A powerhouse faction with strong, expensive troops and an emphasis on melee skills<br/>    The Malice: A swarming faction with overwhelming numbers and a penchant for dark magic<br/><br/><br/>For five hundred years, human civilization languished under the rule of the Kaborha, a society focused solely on honor, battle, and a tri-annual tournament for supremacy.  Now a young hero has emerged, bringing hope of returning humanity to its former glory. But even as Humans rise up against their oppressors, a new threat has come to their world.  The Malice -an interdimensional army of evil creatures- has descended upon the homeland of the Kaborha and Humans, lurching the Fire Continent out of a centuries long stagnation and into war! Traditional ways will be broken and unlikely alliances formed to repel the oncoming evil. Only you have the power to determine the future of the Fire Continent and the world of Yen-Sen.<br/><br/>The time has come for you to lead your chosen forces into battle in Conquest Tactics, a new strategy card game.  Choose your Victory Conditions and your Base, assemble your Troops and march them across the battlefield.  Teach them Spells and Skills to use again and again, and empower them with Equipment.  Bend fate in your favor with Circumstance cards, and claim powerful relics as your Trophies.  Vanquish your enemies by using real strategy, movement and range to your advantage. Never before has a collectible card game given you this much control and this level of strategic choice.<br/><br/>Rather than pursue a single goal, Conquest Tactics has several different Victory Conditions that can be achieved in order to win. You might choose to invade and occupy your opponent&rsquo;s side of the field, destroy their base, challenge troops that are stronger than your own, or upgrade a troop to it&rsquo;s highest potential.  As a reward for achieving a Victory Condition, you are bestowed a Trophy which grants a special onetime benefit, such as the ability to draw extra cards, deal additional damage or search for the perfect troop you need at the moment.<br/><br/>Each army in Conquest Tactics has its own types of troops. Unique to the world of Conquest Tactics are the Kaborha, a strong and proud race matching the cunning of humans with raw animalistic power. Troop cards have deployment, movement, and attack costs. The troop card also lists the damage done by the troop in an attack and the ability of the troop to defend itself. Finally, each troop card details the health of the troop and any special abilities that unit may have.  Some troops have the ability to cast magic or use special skills.<br/><br/>When your Troops can't get by on courage alone, give them Equipment to better their chances of survival.  Equipment comes in three varieties: Armor, Weapons and Accessories.  These improvements attach directly to a Troop, making it more powerful in the midst of battle.  Troops may also use spells and skills on the battlefield.  Spell cards consist of fire, light and dark magic that may be used to heal, harm, cripple and defend in battle. However, only troops that are able to cast a particular type of magic are able to use that magic's spells. These abilities are put into your Knowledge Pool where they may be used repeatedly throughout the game by your various troops, but they have a cost each time they are used and may only be used once per turn.<br/><br/>Each deck has one base which serves as a stronghold and is one of the principal sources of a player's power.  Bases give their armies additional strengths such as the ability to upgrade troops faster or replace fallen troops. However, Bases are not without their weakness as they may be destroyed, removing the benefits granted by it.<br/><br/>Circumstance cards may be played at any time and do not need to be cast by a troop with the ability to use magic.  These cards may enable you to increase your tactical points, negate an attack or even reflect an attack back at a troop when your opponent least expects it!  Circumstance cards are paid for using the cards in your hand. If you don't have enough cards to discard from your hand you can't use your circumstance cards, thus hand management is another essential skill in Conquest Tactics.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "6.73526", "name": "Conquest Tactics", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Hand Management"], "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": ["128779"], "usersrated": "38", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Customizable Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Magazine: Command & Strategy"]}, "94634": {"rpgartist": ["Toren Atkinson", "Thad Doria", "Ben Hossi", "Hal Mangold", "Octographics"], "rpg": ["Mutants & Masterminds (2nd Edition)"], "poll": [], "name": "Adventures into Darkness (M&M Superlink)", "rpgdesigner": ["Kenneth Hite"], "rpgproducer": ["Hal Mangold"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic943057.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Softcover B&W"], "average": "8", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Pulp)", "Action / Adventure (Superheroes)", "History (Alternative)", "Horror (Cthulhu Mythos)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Atomic Overmind Press"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)"], "rpgseries": ["M&M Superlink"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic943057_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb: <br/>What If Lovecraft Wrote Comic Books?<br/>Somewhere, somewhen, he did.

The supply of batteries, patches, and other supplies seemed endless. After all who was there to stop us from walking into the local store and taking them off the shelf? My own feet have been patched numerous times. But the shelves didn't restock themselves and greedy toys took more than their fair share.<br/><br/>Life is damn hard on the street nowadays. At first everything was hunky dory, but life fell apart quickly. At first we thought we had risen into a utopia where no hatred or prejudices existed. We were wrong. It did not take long for the more powerful toys to seize power and subjugate the lesser toys to gathering and maintenance duties. Soon the tyrants of our world had amassed glue, batteries, screws, and thread, the staples of our measly lives. Now they ration it off to those that follow their orders and are good little slaves. Well this is one bear who isn't going to effin' put up with it anymore! These sons of bitches are going to pay for the suffering and pain they have set upon us.

As such, TCAD is primarily designed as a one-shot system, but may be adjusted to simulate a very unlucky but coherent unit of associates.<br/><br/>TCAD uses a simple system of mechanics designed to encourage cooperation, risk-taking, and tension. As an encounter unfolds, each player will ante up a number of their marked poker chips equal to the value of the trait they wish to use. These chips are accumulated, combined with threat and fate chips assigned by the Croupier, the game master who has designed the challenges the group is about to face, and randomly drawn from a bag to determine when and how successfully each person acts against the threat in the encounter. Players may interrupt as each chip is drawn, succeeding in their task, aiding others, or folding defensively before the threat strikes. Particularly good descriptions of actions are rewarded with a Joker Chip to be used in the next round.<br/><br/>As the adventure develops, Survivors learn about each other and gather tools to make their survival more likely, narrating a natural development of traits which they then can use to escape the dangers they find themselves in.

Normally, Black may only place white stones, while White may place either white or black stones.  If the placement of a white stone completes one or more unbroken rows of four or more white stones, all stones in these rows flip to black.  When the board is full, the player with more stones of their color on the board wins.<br/><br/>Balancing stones:<br/>On most standard boards, White has a small but definite advantage. It is suggested to give Black a limited number of black stones which may be played at any time during the game in place of their usual white stone. Though a 'pie-rule' arrangement can ensure that both players agree on the appropriate number of such stones, CPU self-play suggests the following setups as fair, and the 9x9x9 is particularly recommended.<br/><br/>6x6x6    Black gets 5 black stones, white gets first move.<br/>7x7x7    Black gets 4 black stones and first move.<br/>8x8x8    Black gets 3 black stones, White gets first move.<br/>9x9x9    Black gets 3 black stones, White gets first move.<br/>10x10x10 Black gets 2 black stones and first move.<br/><br/>Note that once one accounts for the balancing stones, players may mark cells which can no longer be flipped as white, since Black may not play a black stone there, and White should never choose to.<br/><br/>(submitted by designer)<br/><br/>"}, "94714": {"poll": [], "name": "Monopoly: Emergency Medical Services Edition", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Set Collection", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Monopoly"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic939837_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["USAopoly"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic939837.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Medical", "Negotiation"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Edition of Monopoly with a theme of the Emergency Medical Services.

The player and the enemy both move and fight during the same phase of battle, but the turn order is determined by the actions taken. Parties consist of three characters who each share a single AP gauge, which empties as various actions are performed. During certain parts of the game, the active team may be made up of four members instead of three, though the fourth can only be controlled by the AI. Multiple attacks can be chained together in combos, and the player may execute a special attack called a Trinity Act when each of three characters uses a certain ability. There are also summon beasts in the game called Rogress (\u30ed\u30b0\u30ec\u30b9).<br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Arc Rise Fantasia&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "94720": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Wei-Cheng Cheng"], "poll": [], "name": "Arctic Hunting", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Partnerships", "Role Playing"], "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Bears", "Animals: Seals", "Arctic Theme"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1303251_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Formosa Force Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1303251.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Formosa Force Edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Card Game", "Party Game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "In Arctic circle, a seal cuts 12 breathing holes in the ice in 2 square kilometer region.

Roberts Best Expansion or Supplement for an Existing Game Nominee"], "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>&quot;At the start of 1943 Churchill and Roosevelt had divergent views on the conduct of the war. The British Prime Minister favoured a strategy which focussed on the peripheries of Europe: Italy was a ripe fruit ready to be plucked, via Sicily. For the American President on the contrary, Germany was the sole objective. The enemy was to be struck right in the heart of his war economy, the Ruhr, and by the most direct route: France ! Two operations are studied in the game : &quot;Round up&quot; and &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; which for the Anglo-American general staffs quickly became one operation, &quot;Roundhammer&quot;.<br/><br/>The Trident conference in Washington in May 1943 gave Churchill his way, clearing the road for the invasion of Italy. The Quebec conference in August 1943 (Quadrant) cancelled Roundhammer definitively in favour of the future Operation Overlord in 1944, developed in the game Liberty Roads.<br/><br/>But what would have happened if the allies had dared to launch Operation Roundhammer in mid-September 1943, as the generals had planned?<br/><br/>At this date, the Atlantic Wall defences were still barely started on many beaches. A large number of the German divisions in France at that time were undergoing training and were not yet operational. As for the Panzer Divisions, they were not yet equipped with the formidable Panther tank.<br/><br/>But on the allied side there was a lack of US units. The majority had been sent to the Mediterranean, or were training in the USA. The amphibious capacity of the invasion force was far from sufficient and British reserves were very weak. Worse yet, aerial supremacy was not complete with an omnipresent Luftwaffe. Mission impossible?<br/><br/>The Roundhammer 1943 module allows you to supply an answer through this what-if game ! The extension of Liberty Roads includes those extra units present in Western Europe at the time, along with new supports and Atlantikwall/D-Day markers, with a &lsquo;1943&rsquo; ambiance.&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "0", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "French first edition"], "name": "Roundhammer 1943", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Simulation"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "35", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "average": "7.82857"}, "94730": {"poll": [], "name": "Freddy vs. Jason Forest of Fear Game", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "9", "boardgamefamily": ["Movies: Friday the 13th", "A Nightmare on Elm Street"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic951624_t.jpg", "average": "4.44444", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["NECA"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic951624.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Horror", "Miniatures"], "age": "14", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Theme:<br/>Freddy vs. Jason Forest of Fear Game is a collector's edition game with high-quality 3D miniatures!

To secure this new freedom, the Estonian Army fought a valiant defensive campaign against vastly superior forces on two fronts. With the help of its western allies, most notably Britain, Finland, Sweden, and Denmark, the brave Estonian Army rapidly built up its strength and experience while fighting furiously for every meter of ground. They successfully held off the Soviet Western Front offensive, as well as crushing the Estonian Red Army, the Red Latvian Riflemen, and multiple Baltic-German armies between 1918 and 1920. Their triumphant bid for freedom established the Republic of Estonia&rsquo;s sovereignty amid the quagmire of World War One&rsquo;s aftermath and the Russian Civil War. On Feb. 2, 1920, the Treaty of Tartu finalized their independence. The mouse roared, and the birds of prey fled.<br/><br/>The Mouse That Roared is a supplement for the Infantry Attacks series, with 10 new scenarios portraying the key battles that enabled little Estonia to fend off the Russian giant and establish her independence from Russia for the first time since the Great Northern War in 1710. We also provide you with 165 new playing units depicting the Estonian military and Red Russians, Red Estonians, and Red Latvians from the Civil War period.  The Mouse That Roared is not a complete game: ownership of Infantry Attacks: August 1914 is necessary to provide the rules, charts, markers and game boards.<br/><br/>The Mouse That Roared is sold in two formats: printed with laser-cut counters, and via .pdf download.  For the latter, the playing pieces are not die-cut and mounted, nor is the scenario book printed.

The game was one of the early games released for the FDS, and the second original title after The Legend of Zelda. The release was initially scheduled to coincide with the release of the FDS itself, but setbacks in development caused it to be released much later, contributing to its relative lack of popularity. Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, and Konami's Castlevania were also released for the FDS in the same year, but Nazo no Murasame-j\u014d failed to achieve the same sort of commercial success. The game was never released outside Japan.<br/><br/>The game takes place in Edo period Japan ruled by the fourth shogun Tokugawa Ietsuna. Murasame Castle, located somewhere in Japan, houses a gigantic stone statue known as Murasame. The people lived peacefully until one stormy night, when a shining golden object fell onto the castle from the sky. Deafening shrieks arose from the castle, and the shining object is later revealed to be an alien creature who gives life to the stone statue Murasame and takes over the castle. The alien creature extends its power to four other neighboring castles, giving the daimyo lords each an evil sphere of power. The lords are taken over by the alien's evil power, and use the spheres to summon ninja armies and monsters to attack villagers. Hearing of these strange occurrences, the shogunate sends Takamaru, a samurai apprentice, on a secret mission to investigate the castle. As Takamaru, the player must infiltrate the four castles to defeat each castle lord, before going on to face the alien entity itself.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>The game is played in top-down view with no scrolling; a setup similar to that of the first Legend of Zelda game. The gameplay itself differs from Zelda in that Nazo no Murasame-j\u014d is a fast-paced linear action game with time limits. The game has only a limited number of power-ups, forcing players to rely on their own action skills more than anything else.<br/><br/>All of the game's levels take place in Murasame Castle and the four neighboring castles, and the appearance of enemy characters (including samurai, ninjas and hannya) borrows heavily from existing Japanese culture. Each level, divided into two parts: the path to the castle, and the castle itself, is of considerable size, and the player must defeat generic enemy characters to reach the innermost region of the castle where the castle-lord resides. The player is often attacked by multiple enemies attacking from all different directions, lending to the game's high difficulty. Though there is an ending demo prepared after the final boss, the game reboots by looping back to the beginning at the conclusion of the demo.<br/><br/>The player's only weapons are a katana and shurikens; upgrades to the shuriken can be obtained, but are lost whenever the player loses a life. The katana can only be used when Takamaru is close to an enemy or projectile (excluding fireballs), while the shurikens can only be used when he is farther away. The katana can also be used to deflect projectiles. Other items are fireballs, which are more powerful than the shurikens; a lightning-themed explosive, which gives heavy damage to every enemy on screen; and a cloak, which makes Takamaru invisible and invulnerable to enemies and objects for a short period of time. Extra lives can be obtained by rescuing damsels in distress, but they are sometimes disguised devils who stubbornly chase the player around the castle.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Nazo no Murasame J\u014d&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "94902": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic953914.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Bill Slavicsek"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2008", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Mari Kolkowsky"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Wizards of the Coast"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic953914_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Fantasy"], "description": "Another board-game format introduction to the Dungeons &amp; Dragons RPG.

These basic/starter boxed sets attempt to bridge the gap between miniatures board games, miniatures war games, and role-playing games by using a board-and-counter/miniature format with simplified versions of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons rules.<br/><br/>This entry returns to cardboard counters used in the 2000 &quot;Adventure Game&quot; version, after a couple &quot;Basic Game&quot; versions using miniatures released in 2004 and 2006; this version updates the rules set to D&amp;D 4th Edition, and continues the tradition of including completely new adventures and selections of monsters and pre-generated player characters, but is otherwise virtually the same product as its predecessors, and this line of games would be joined in 2010 by yet another updated, &quot;Red Box&quot; 4th Edition Essentials basic/starter game version.<br/><br/>All these basic/starter games are direct fore-runners of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Adventure System&quot; boardgames (&quot;Castle Ravenloft&quot; and &quot;Wrath of Ashardalon&quot;), which are still simplified versions of the D&amp;D rules set using tile-based game boards and miniatures.<br/><br/>The box cover of this version says &quot;2-5 players&quot;, but there are enough included materials for 6 players (5 pre-generated Player-Characters, and one Dungeon Master.)<br/><br/>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Starter Sets:<br/>2nd Edition: The New Easy to Master Dungeons & Dragons and Introduction to Advanced Dungeons & Dragons<br/>3rd Edition/3.5 Dungeons & Dragons Basic Game<br/>4th Edition: Dungeons & Dragons Roleplaying Game Starter Set<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English Fourth \"Blue Box\" Edition", "English Fourth \"Red Box\" edition"], "age": "12", "name": "Dungeons & Dragons Roleplaying Game Starter Set", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Role Playing"], "average": "7.18226", "usersrated": "62", "boardgamefamily": ["Dungeons & Dragons", "From RPG books to board games"]}, "94903": {"poll": [], "name": "The Royal Geographical Pastime or the Complete Tour of Europe", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Point to Point Movement", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1768", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Thomas Jeffreys"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Educational", "Travel"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "A board game using a map of Europe with a city-to-city path of spaces from Dover (#1) to London (#103).<br/>Players roll an 8-sided teetotum (because dice were heavily taxed at the time) and move along the path.

With only the judges able to put a stop to it before many lives are lost, or worse still, the violence spreads throughout the city - Block Mania! Now you take the role of a Mega-City block and must fight your own block war, dishing out the ultra-violence from the relatively safe perspective of your dining room table. The only hazards you shall face will be spilled cups of synthi-caf, your partner wanting to set the dinner or a knock on the door from the judges.<br/><br/>Object of the Game<br/>You play the role of a Mega-City block out to win a local block war, through killing opponents, gaining objectives and morale boosting actions, with success measured in &lsquo;Fighting Spirit&rsquo;. <br/>Winning the Game<br/>The game lasts until one block has achieved a comprehensive victory, neighbouring blocks surrender, are wiped out, or when the judges arrive in force to shut the shooting match down.<br/>It is helpful to set a time limit for play, say two hours. Once that time has been reached and the round finished, each player in turn order starting is allowed one turn before points are calculated and a winner decided.<br/><br/>"}, "94970": {"videogame": ["Unreal", "Unreal Mission Pack: Return to Na Pali"], "poll": [], "name": "Unreal Gold", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US Windows edition"], "average": "7", "videogameseries": ["Unreal"], "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "videogamefranchise": ["Unreal"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Digital Extremes", "Epic Games", "Legend Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["First Person Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "usersrated": "1", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Infogrames Entertainment SA (IESA)"], "videogamecompilation": ["Unreal", "Unreal Mission Pack: Return to Na Pali"], "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>This is a compilation of the first &quot;Unreal&quot; and its expansion: &quot;Unreal Mission Pack: Return to Na Pali&quot;.<br/><br/>"}, "94971": {"rpgdesigner": ["Tom Beckmeier", "Alexander Berendt", "Frank Hellmann", "Christian Lonsing", "Nils Rehm", "Andreas Sch\u00e4pel", "Jan Christoph Steines"], "statistics": [], "name": "Trodox (Issue 26 - 2002)", "rpgartist": ["Tobias Haas", "John James", "Josef Santo"], "rpgproducer": ["Frank Hellmann", "Nils Rehm"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic942695.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Der Trodox - Ars Arcana"], "rpgissuearticle": ["...und sonst noch?", "Cyberpunk \u00c4gypten: Shockwave", "Der Einschlag", "Intro", "Leserwahl", "Reaktionen", "Der Sturm", "TRODOX goes Multimedia"], "rpg": ["Private Eye (4th Edition)", "Shadowrun (3rd Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["TX-Team"], "rpgissueversion": ["issue 26"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic942695_t.jpg", "description": "(user summary)<br/><br/>table of contents:<br/><br/>letters to the editor<br/>editorial<br/>short story: Der Einschlag<br/>private eye scenario: Der Sturm<br/>Cyberpunk Egypt: solutions for the run &quot;Shockwave&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "94972": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2517640.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Enric Mart\u00ed"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Javier Romero"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "Ludopress"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2517640_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Nautical", "Wargame"], "description": "Santiago 1898 is a mini game of the naval battle between the US NAvy and the Armada espa&ntilde;ola off Santiago in june 1898.<br/><br/>The game is played an undetermined number of turns in a boxed mapboard.

The coprocessor was generally used for sound processing.<br/><br/>Initially, the (AES) home system was only available for rent to commercial establishments, such as hotel chains, bars and restaurants, and other venues. When customer response indicated that some gamers were willing to buy a $650 console, SNK expanded sales and marketing into the home console market. The Neo Geo console was officially launched on 31 January 1990 in Osaka, Japan. Compared to the other 16-bit consoles of the time, Neo Geo's graphics and sound were vastly superior. Furthermore, since the AES was identical to its arcade counterpart, the MVS, arcade titles released for the home market were perfect translations.

These are typically secret organizations, composed only of males, which engage in the construction of enchanted masks. In recent years, though, some have begun to question the tradition that limits membership to men.<br/><br/>A mask-making society is responsible for maintaining the history, mythology, and arcane lore of a community, as well as punishing criminals and enforcing morality. By concealing their identities, mask makers are able to operate without fear of reprisal. More importantly, a mask maker ritually assumes the identity of an orisha spirit by constructing and wearing an enchanted mask, and takes on the powers granted by that spirit. For this reason, masks are tremendously important to Nyamban cultures.<br/><br/>Some mask-making societies operate openly with the blessing and support of a community, and many rural villages are actually controlled by mask-making societies rather than any traditional form of government. Unfortunately, some mask makers become drunk with power and turn their societies into little more than magically potent organized crime gangs.<br/><br/>This free Nyambe: African Adventures preview introduces you to the mask maker prestige class, and some examples of the magical masks they create.<br/><br/>"}, "94996": {"rpgartist": ["Philippe Bulott", "Bill Carr", "Christopher Gerber", "Paul Gibson", "Richard Jeferies", "Max V.
