For four years the Great Patriotic War continued. Millions of soldiers, thousands of tanks and planes &ndash; the entire might of USSR , Great Britain , France and many other countries were sent to battle. In the end fascist Germany was defeated.<br/><br/>The strategic card game &ldquo;Victory Day&rdquo; is dedicated to the last period of the war when soviet soldiers assaulted Berlin and completely broke the German forces. Each player takes on the role of a division commander. He has command over different units: infantry, armored vehicles, artillery and aviation.<br/><br/>Each unit has a historic counterpart &ndash; so for instance each rifle company in the game is a counterpart of real life divisions, platoons of KV tanks and T-34s, batteries of &ldquo;Katusha&rdquo; rocket launchers, squadrons of LA-7s and Tu-2 and so on. All in game characteristics were done keeping in mind the actual abilities of the historic counterparts. By using special &ldquo;tactical cards&rdquo; you can use different assaults, tactical maneuvers and psychological effects. Throughout the game, players simulate different actions of their divisions: charges and break through, artillery support and aerial bombings, organization off defenses and blocking enemy troops.<br/><br/>All units in the game and all game events are shown as cards. Each card has an image of the unit, it's characteristics and abilities and also a text &ndash; usually it's a quotation from a historical novel or memoires, or some information on the current unit. All illustrations on the cards are done from actual black and white photos done during the war by using computer technologies.<br/><br/>Booster packs containing new cards have been released for &ldquo;Victory Day&rdquo;. Players can add any of these cards to their decks by purchasing the booster packs sold separately. This way, players can make their own unique decks by adding new cards to it. Depending on the cards in the deck victory may be easier than before. It's more important to have a balanced deck fit for different situations then just by adding strong cards. But both players need to have an equal amount of cards in their decks. It is also not recommended to have more than 60 cards in the deck.<br/><br/>There is also a mmo game based on &ldquo;Victory Day&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;The War Online&rdquo;<br/><br/>Victory Day&rdquo; the board game is based mostly on &ldquo;The War&rdquo; CCG.

Although the plot and actual level layout was mostly altered from the original to avoid conflict with publisher Konami, the bonus Balloon blow up mini-game was included in the remake.<br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons_Arcade_Game,&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons_Arcade_Game,&quot</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "104490": {"rpgdesigner": ["Andrew Helfer"], "rpg": ["Find Your Fate"], "poll": [], "name": "Indiana Jones and the Cup of the Vampire", "rpgartist": ["David B.

The board has multiple different zones with specific attributes, a market, a travel zone, a crafting zone, a church, and a council house.  Many of these offer multiple options, so even if you take a cube from the crafting area, you can get an ox, a horse, a cart, a plow, a scroll, or convert wheat to gold.  Each zone is seeded with cubes of four colors plus black cubes which serve as curses, there are lots of turns per round. Some areas offer short-term scoring, others offer long-term scoring, and still others offer only end-game scoring. The round ends when there are no cubes at any location.  The game ends when either the village chronicle or the anonymous graveyard is full.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Brazilian first edition", "Bulgarian first edition", "Chinese Edition", "Czech first edition", "Dutch first edition", "English edition 2012 with Kennerspiel des Jahres", "English second edition", "English second edition with bonus customers", "English/German first edition", "English/German second edition with bonus customers", "English/German second edition with KdJ", "English/German third edition with multiple awards", "French first edition", "Greek first edition", "Hungarian first edition", "Italian first edition", "Japanese first edition", "Kadabra Baltic edition 2013", "Lautapelit.fi first edition", "Polish first edition", "Romanian first edition", "Russian edition", "Spanish first edition", "Spanish second edition"], "average": "7.56783", "name": "Village", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Set Collection", "Worker Placement"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["136223", "155996", "124118", "166592"], "usersrated": "13846", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Village"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["AP Podcast \u2013 Episodio 11: Zombicide", "AP Podcast \u2013 Episodio 4: La Villa vs Spartacus", "Episode 14: Better Late Than Never", "Episode 41: Village, Honorary Founder Rodney Smith, Remote Gaming and A Potpourri of Questions", "Garrett's Games 469 - The Village + Port Expansion, and Stichling", "Heavy Cardboard Episode 39 \u2013 Top 50 Favorite Games of Right Now", "Heavy Cardboard Episode 52 &ndash; Amanda&rsquo;s Top 50 &amp; Edward&rsquo;s Top 50", "House Rules 47: Discussing the Top Five", "LamasLive \u2013 Der Nachschlag!", "Ludology Episode 51 - 50 for 50, Part 2", "Podcast #061 - Spiel des Jahres 2013", "Recon #4: Village", "RJ23: La consulta, l'opini&oacute; i la col&middot;laboraci&oacute;!", "The One About the Duke of Dice", "Village (Pegasus / eggertspiele): Spiele-Podcast Nr. 151"]}, "104007": {"videogame": ["Quattro Skills"], "poll": [], "name": "Pro Skateboard Simulator", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["UK Amstrad CPC Edition", "UK Commodore 64 Edition", "UK ZX Spectrum Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1728165.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Sports - Skateboarding"], "videogamefranchise": ["Codemasters Simulators"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Codemasters"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["Amstrad CPC", "Commodore 64", "ZX Spectrum"], "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Codemasters"], "videogamecompilation": ["Quattro Skills"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1728165_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>In Pro Skateboard Simulator you literally get to skate till you drop.

Each section includes text that you can read aloud directly to your players, generally when the characters see a new area for the first time, and some include mini-vignettes featuring that area of the station.<br/><br/>In addition, the first division -- which describes 7-Osiris as an active, functional repair station -- also includes one extra section, Cast of Characters, which briefly describes the NPCs who run, use and visit 7-Osiris.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "104024": {"rpgartist": ["Danilo Moretti", "Gillian Pearce"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Spaceport Black Orchard", "rpgdesigner": ["Martin Ralya"], "rpgproducer": ["Marcella Ganow", "Vicki Potter", "Elizabeth M.

no matter what you do to be different, you will always be who you really are in the end.

You have to be ready for any possibility and you need to be able to visualize things in your head that some people have trouble doing with visual aids. It's a tough job being the person running a game for others, but it's a rewarding one. Some even say that being a Game Master is a calling, not a job.<br/><br/>No one can tell you if you are a good Game Master or not, so the only way you'll ever know is to try it out and then try it again and again. Different people, different stories and game settings, even different moods can affect everything about the way you run a game and deal with your players. Setbacks happen from time to time so never give up and never feel down about a game session that didn't go as well as you had hoped.<br/><br/>For those of you who don't seem to have all the natural requisites and raw talent for Game Mastering, we have presented here for you, a one-stop guide to being a great GM.

Because of that, each person playing the game has a role in making the game great.

They are the teller of the tale, the guardian of the rules, and the final judge in all disputes within the game.

When you played cops and robbers, pretended to be a knight slaying a dragon, played house and a bunch of different other games you were role playing. The only difference now is that you use rule books and the fantasy is much more detailed.<br/><br/>This doesn't really tell you what being a player means, but it's a start and if you don't know by the end of this guide, then you'll just have to play and find out for yourself.<br/><br/>"}, "104047": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "poll": [], "name": "How to Make a Great Campaign", "rpgdesigner": ["Jerimy J.

Often times it is easy to think that these people are just lucky enough to played under a great game-master, which is probably somewhat true.

The most successful game of all time includes the word in its title. But what is it about dungeons that really make them special, and how can you make a dungeon into a rich memorable environment rather than just a hole in the ground?<br/><br/>The tradition of the dungeon in storytelling echoes back to the myths of ancient Greece, and the stories of heroes traveling to the underworld to reclaim forgotten secrets, hidden treasures or captured maidens. The dungeon in a role-playing game follows the same patterns.<br/><br/>A dungeon is a place where adventurers find hidden truths, they may be locations where ancient treasures have been set aside and forgotten, or they may be carefully guarded strongholds where the treasures are not only remembered but they are feared and worship.  The thing to always remember about a dungeon is that it is a place set apart from the rest of the world, it might be riddled with traps, it might be filled with nightmarish creatures, or it might be something else entirely. Dungeons need not be purely fantastic; there are numerous environments similar to the traditional dungeon setting in the real world, but even these real world dungeons have secrets and mystery shrouding them.<br/><br/>The use of dungeons in role-playing games can vary dramatically. Some game masters use dungeons as focal points for a series of stories, others use some kind of underground setting in ever session they run; there are even campaigns where every game is played out in a single unimaginably vast labyrinth. None of these options is more correct when it comes to dungeons, and each has a chance to be truly great.<br/><br/>"}, "104050": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing", "PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "GameMastery Flip-Mat: Urban Tavern", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1298840.jpg", "usersrated": "5", "average": "7.4", "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgpublisher": ["Paizo Publishing", "Steel Sqwire"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["GameMastery", "Pathfinder Flip-Mat"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1298840_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>Get ready for a barroom blitz with GameMastery Flip-Mat: Urban Tavern!

Armed with a flint axe and a pair of javelins, the player sets off to the wilderness...<br/><br/>Sapiens is a simulation game with a few roleplaying and trading elements. The player explores the wilderness (using one of the two display modes, a scrolling side view, a 3d view or a map) and interacts with the environment, collecting useful items along the way. The game tracks the physical condition of the character, so an important element of the game is learning how to survive, for example by learning what plants are edible, how to find water and how to avoid dangerous hunting grounds. The player has a lot of actions available, including drinking, sleeping, treating injuries, making weapons with flint stones (the game includes a &quot;carving&quot; minigame), hunt, fight (another minigame)...<br/><br/>As advertised on the cover, there are more than three million different locations to visit. The game features wildlife (rabbits, wolves, bears...) and other tribes, some of them hostile and some of them open to trading. The ultimate goal of the player is to complete the five missions given to him by Hognor, and how the player approaches each mission is completely open.<br/><br/>The game was developed by Didier and Olivier Guillion, the music was composed by Gilles Soulet.<br/><br/>"}, "104068": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["Competition Version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Dungeon of Doom", "rpgdesigner": ["Dave Bernazzani"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1054534.png", "usersrated": "15", "average": "6.6", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["The Dungeon of Doom"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1054534_t.png", "description": "The Dungeon of Doom was created for the RPG Geek 2yr anniversary.

Puerto Rico never looked more beautiful - Puerto Rico the game that is. Ranked as the #1 game on BoardGameGeek for eight years in a row, over 250,000 units of the board game sold, and winner of the International Gamers Award, it was no surprise when Ravensburger Digital decided to reinvent the company's classic strategy game. Unveiling their iPad app to a new generation of players, this advanced multi-player game will please Puerto Rico veterans and new gamers alike.<br/><br/>Sailing to the shores of Puerto Rico, players put their entrepreneurial skills to the test, as they take on roles of Captain, Settler, Prospector, Builder, Mayor, Craftsmen or Trader in a multi-player, multi-task setting. But choose wisely! Your role may dictate your victory. How do you win? Well as they say, to the victor go the... victory points? Yes! In this game, wealth is measured in more than just doubloons. Conquer other players by accumulating the most victory points through the construction of the grandest buildings, harvesting the most fruitful crops and shipping the most bountiful harvest back to the Old World - all of which is only a finger tap away on the new application for iPad. Strategy, creativity and some luck may just make you governor of the island.<br/><br/>Andreas Seyfarth, the creator of the original board game, commented, &quot;this conversion was really successful. All the game play modes have been enhanced: Online mode, Solo mode, multiple difficulty levels - everything is there.&quot; Noted for its complexity, Puerto Rico finds sweet simplicity as an app on the iPad. With a built-in tutorial for those new to the game (or anyone who needs a quick refresher course) the app brings to life the world of Puerto Rico and allows them to share their experience with fellow Puerto Rico fans all over world. Staying true to the original game the application version doesn't lose any of its lusters, which Seyfarth applauds, saying, &quot;The conversion of the rules and the game play is impressive, the developer really did a great job.

You can move freely in any direction, the direction and distance being determined entirely by your physical skill.<br/><br/>It simulates a style of game played in the 70s and 80s, where you play on a real piece of paper and just use a pencil and your imagination to create the battlefield, units and rules of play.<br/><br/>You make your move by holding the top of a pencil pointing straight down on the paper. You apply pressure down and by tilting the pencil away from the desired direction it suddenly slips towards your desired direction and marks the paper. This line drawn determines your shot or move.<br/><br/>In Lead Wars, two players take turns moving their tanks, planes and artillery units around the landscape, avoiding obstacles like rivers, lakes, trees and buildings in the hope to wipe out the all their enemy&rsquo;s units before they do.<br/><br/>In the real life version, you make your move, rub out the line and the tank where you started and draw it at the new position (or erase an enemy which you hit). In Lead Wars units move smoothly across the page and explode.  If you go off the page or into water then BOOM!  Planes can fly over obstacles, but are susceptible to mid-air collisions.<br/><br/>So the game saves you on expensive paper and erasers, time consuming rubbing out and the health and safety issues of flinging a pencil around the table.

A single 6-sided die is used for almost all mechanisms. Vehicles, if hit, require a further roll to determine damage.  Morale is checked once a unit has received a number of casualties which varies with nationality.

Players build their dice pools according to their character's abilities and weapons, and each die in the pool contributes to an attack in different ways.

An attack by crazed goblins reveals the shadows of a forgotten past returning to threaten the town&mdash;and perhaps all of Varisia. The Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path begins with this goblin raid and takes players on an epic journey through the land of Varisia as they track a cult of serial killers, fight backwoods ogres, stop an advancing army of stone giants, delve into ancient dungeons, and finally face off against a wizard-king in his ancient mountaintop city. This hardcover compilation updates the fan-favorite campaign to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game rules with revised and new content in more than 400 pages packed with mayhem, excitement, and adventure! Celebrating both the fifth anniversary of the Pathfinder Adventure Path and the tenth anniversary of Paizo Publishing, this new edition expands the original campaign with new options and refined encounters throughout, incorporating 5 years of community feedback.<br/><br/>The Rise of the Runelords Anniversary Edition contains: <br/><br/>    All six chapters of the original Adventure Path, expanded and updated for use with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.<br/>    Articles on the major locations of Rise of the Runelords: sleepy Sandpoint, the ancient Thassilonian city of Xin-Shalast, and others.<br/>    Revelations on the sinister magic of Thassilon, with updated spells, magic items, and details on tracking sin points throughout the campaign.<br/>    A bestiary featuring eight monsters updated from the original Adventure Path, plus an all new terror.<br/>    Dozens    of new illustrations, never-before-seen characters, location maps, and more!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Frequently Asked Questions:<br/><br/>Q: Will you be doing hardcover compilations of all of your Adventure Paths?<br/>A: No. This is a special celebration of our very first Adventure Path on its 5th Anniversary. Several of the original volumes of Rise of the Runelords have been unavailable in print for a long time, yet it remains one of our most popular adventure paths; that circumstance presents a unique opportunity for us to expand and update it for use with the Pathfinder RPG, and to apply lessons we've learned about making Adventure Paths over the last half-decade. Our other adventure paths are largely still in print, and many of them were designed for use with the Pathfinder RPG to begin with; we have no plans to recompile them anytime soon.<br/><br/>Q: Is there anything missing from the original AP volumes?<br/>A: Yes&mdash;otherwise, this book would be more than 600 pages long! Some of the monsters and other things created for Rise of the Runelords are now part of the official Pathfinder RPG rules, so they're not reprinted here. The original volumes also included monster ecologies, bestiary entries, and other campaign setting material that isn't directly used in the adventure itself; those items are also not present in this collection. The Pathfinder Journal fiction featuring Eando Kline is not presented here either, but it has been compiled&mdash;along with the installments from the subsequent two Adventure Paths&mdash;as The Compass Stone, now available in ePub form. We have also replaced some of the artwork from the previous edition, and replaced the six individual introductions with one new one.<br/><br/>"}, "104214": {"poll": [], "name": "Uno: Super Bowl XL Steelers Special Edition", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports Teams: Pittsburgh Steelers", "Sports: American Football / Gridiron", "UNO"], "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1061480_t.jpg", "average": "6.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Sababa Toys, Inc."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1061480.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Sababa Toys first edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "A Special Edition of Uno the successful commercial version of crazy eights that is dedicated to The Super Bowl XL champion Pittsburgh Steelers.<br/>Includes Exclusive MVP Card (Hines Ward) and rule.<br/>When an MVP card is played the person who played it chooses another player to draw cards from the draw pile until he gets an 8 or a 6 (based on Hines Ward's uniform number of 86) or has reached five cards drawn if no 8 or 6 comes up. <br/>If an 8 or 6 is drawn it is put into the discard pile and the person who played the MVP card chooses the color to continue playing with regardless of last card played to the discard pile.<br/>The MVP card can be used as a player's last card allowing him/her to go out of the game. if this happens a player to draw must still be chosen.

However, the heart of the nation beats in the capital of Big Gobba. It's here, on the Hill slopes, where the local chiefs dwelled. Upon discovering on the morrow of the recent festival that city's elite'd got lost somewhere, common goblins gave all other stuff up &mdash; it's high time to climb up the very top of the Hill, to the Cauldron, strike it and seize a better office.<br/><br/>Who doesn't want to become the Great Chief and rule the biggest Gobba in the world?! I'm asking you &mdash; who?<br/><br/>According to the classification, Gobba is a kind of &quot;resource gathering and winning on points&quot; game. Goblin players travel around the levels of the Hill and do their best to collect the required quantity of resources in order to win election for one of five offices.<br/><br/>Under the Hill a large Dump spreads out &mdash; upon getting here, players draw a card from the catch deck. They might get either a gizmo of some value and with some ability or a cataclysm impacting the overall situation in Big Gobba. As goblins are sly by nature, they can even hide a cataclysm that is unfavorable for them. However, when revealed, the deceit will be punished for sure.<br/><br/>The level above the Dump is occupied by Hovels. It's the place where goblins make hidings of their cards, so that their hand can be unloaded. However, it's a risky business, as there might come some enthusiasts for exploring others' hidings.<br/><br/>Yet higher the craftsmen level lies. Each cell up there has its own ability. For instance, in Hurler you can pay for flying to any other cell, in Booth you can play a shell game with another goblin, in Bazaar you can buy or sell a gizmo, and so on.<br/><br/>Above the craftsmen level, the elected elite of Big Gobba dwells. At first the area is empty, still whenever some goblin becomes elected &mdash; other players will have to pay for passage through the occupied dwelling.<br/><br/>The Cauldron is situated on the very top of the Hill. To announce an election, you have to climb up there and strike it. Whoever makes a higher bid, wins. Unless, to speak the truth, some evil-minded goblin throws a Sour Watermelon and scuttles the election. I bet they can.<br/><br/>Still, even if you succeeded in getting some office, it's too early to relax. The point is nobody in Big Gobba has ever abolished reelections. They do cost more but cunning competitors can hardly be frightened by a high price.<br/><br/>The victor is the goblin who gets more offices, and if there is an equal number &mdash; the goblin with senior offices. For instance, Trader stands higher than the Deputy of Hovels as the elections of the first one are paid with expensive gizmos, and for the Deputy whatever resources go.<br/><br/>During the game goblins can surprise each other in many ways: push down, stab with a knife, befuddle with mushrooms as well as use various sophisticated gizmos like Dusty Sack or Primus Stove.<br/><br/>Goblin-like elections may lead to a triumph or a scuffle but they will never make you weary! <br/> "}, "104220": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Trumpeter (Vol 2, Issue 7 -

Specifically describes features in Fractal Mapper 8.<br/><br/>Fractal Mapper is stuffed full of powerful features and functionality! You'll find that Fractal Mapper is a well rounded, powerful graphics application suitable for a wide variety of fantasy map making!<br/><br/>Powerful Graphics Engine<br/>Fractal Mapper features a fast, optimized vector graphics engine designed from the ground up for fantasy map making. Each object placed on the map can be individually selected and modified. The graphics engine supports object rotation to any angle, resizing, reshaping, scaled (geometric) lines, bitmap pattern fills, and variable levels of transparency. In addition, FM features a powerful zooming capability that lets you fill in small map details on continental or even planet-wide maps.<br/><br/>Fractal Drawing Tools<br/>Fractal Mapper gets its name from its set of Fractal drawing tools. These allow you to easily draw out natural looking continents, islands, rivers, and caverns. In addition, FM contains a number of non-fractal drawing tools for drawing out more regular shapes such as straight lines, polygons, circles, and spline curves.<br/><br/>Full Color Mapping Symbols<br/>Fractal Mapper includes over 600 full color mapping symbols you can place on your maps. Sets include symbols for world maps, dungeon interiors, towns, and sci-fi deck plans. Fractal Mapper supports two types of symbols - raster symbols which are image files of several common formats, and vector symbols which are simply other Fractal Mapper maps. The symbol library is customizable, so you can easily add your own symbols as well.<br/><br/>.PNG Mapping Symbols<br/>Fractal Mapper also features optimized support for 32-bit .PNG image files, complete with support for variable levels of transparency (alpha channels). Over 100 &lsquo;battlemap&rsquo; symbols in .PNG format are included for use in creating great looking maps designed for miniature use.<br/><br/>Text<br/>You can place text on your maps using any True Type&reg; font installed on your system. Text can wrap across multiple lines, be left-right-center justified, and can be rotated to any angle. Text can have it's own outline and fill colors, making it easy to create attractive, stylish text on your map. Unicode text can also be placed on your maps, allowing for the placement of text in such languages as Chinese, Japanese, or Korean.<br/><br/>Grids<br/>FM can place square, hex, offset square, or dot grids of any color, size, and transparency level on your map - either above or below the objects on your map. Grid cells can also be numbered in the font and text size of your choice, as well as aligned in the cell several different ways - a great feature for wargamers! In addition, polygons and other shapes on your map can be individually filled with a grid. These grid fills can be 'synchronized' with the main grid to create seamless grid patterns within irregular shapes (like caverns).<br/><br/>Printing<br/>Once you have your map, you&rsquo;ll likely want to print it off for use at your game. Printing across multiple pages, fit to page, or at specific zoom percentages is supported. When square grids are set, you can even print the map out at specific sizes, such as 1 grid = 1 inch. The entire map or a portion can be printed. Maps printed across multiple pages can be 'overprinted' to make them easier to tape together. If desired, you can print a single page of a tiled map without having to print the entire set again. FM also features a tiled print preview so you can see how those big multi-paged prints will align on the pages - a big ink saver!<br/><br/>Special Effects<br/>Fractal Mapper supports a number of special raster-based effects you can use to enhance the look of your maps. Bevel effects, for example, can be applied to create a raised edge on objects of various styles. Or apply Texture effects to an object to define its surface texture. Objects can be made to cast a drop shadow, or even a shadow onto itself. Blurs can also be applied to objects - either on the entire object or to create a &lsquo;feathered&rsquo; edge.<br/><br/>Color Themes<br/>Your maps can be displayed in several different color themes. By default maps are shown in full color. But you can also choose to display your map in grayscale, black and white, or with a sepia color theme.<br/><br/>Exporting<br/>Fractal Mapper maps can be exported to several image file formats: Windows bitmaps (*.bmp), JPEG files (*.jpg), Portable Network Graphics images (.png), and Enhanced Windows Metafiles (.emf). Either the entire map or a selected portion of the map can be exported.<br/><br/>Campaign notes and the Scenario Builder<br/>Fractal Mapper isn&rsquo;t just a graphics tool &ndash; you can also store your campaign notes along with your map. Each object on your map can have assigned to it two sets of notes &ndash; one for the GM, and one for the players. You can even define an area on the map as that object&rsquo;s illustration. Once you have the notes, the Scenario Builder allows you to create an HTML file (web page) or print out an illustrated version of them. You can print out all of the notes, or create a player-version for hand outs.<br/><br/>Plug-in and Scripting Interface<br/>Do you dabble in code? Fractal Mapper features a sophisticated scripting interface called the GoblinAPI which allows you to create new program features, custom drawing tools, map generators, and perform complex actions on your map. You don&rsquo;t have to be a programmer to use Fractal Mapper, obviously, but if you are - you&rsquo;ll enjoy the flexibility!<br/>Read more about the GoblinAPI<br/><br/>The Inspiration Pad<br/>Need help coming up with names? Let the Inspiration Pad help! The Inspiration Pad is a built in name generator you can use to create endless inspiration for place and people names. Drag and drop randomly generated names onto your map! Over 25 random name generators are included, and since the Inspiration Pad is plug-in based, you can also add your own.<br/><br/>Hyperlinking<br/>You can hyperlink Fractal Mapper maps together, allowing you to create interactive atlases. Each object on your map can be assigned another map as a link. When you click on that object with the link tool, the linked map is displayed. In addition, other types of files, such as PDF&rsquo;s , spreadsheets, or even URL&rsquo;s, can be linked to. When one of those links is clicked, the file is opened up in it&rsquo;s application (or a browser window is opened and the web site navigated to, in the case of web links).<br/><br/>Localization<br/>Fractal Mapper is used in many countries all over the world. So to make FM more friendly and approachable to the world audience, it can display its menus, buttons, and windows in languages other than English. FM uses a simple text based system for storing translation data, which means anyone can add support for a language (if they speak that language, that is). Language files will be hosted seperately on NBOS Online Exchange as they become available. (note: FM8 does not support unicode - only latin-based character sets)<br/><br/>3D Terrain<br/>Fractal Mapper includes a free add-on program called Fractal World Explorer. You can use FWE to create great looking 3d shaded relief maps, and then edit and shape the terrain. Once you have a planet you like, you can then export the map for use in Fractal Mapper.<br/>Read more about Fractal World Explorer<br/><br/>Globe View<br/>Another free add-on program included with Fractal Mapper is the newly redesigned Globe viewer. With this tool, you can wrap your world maps around an interactive globe. You can rotate and pan around your planet, and zoom in and out. The globe view can also be exported as a graphic or even a movie file!<br/><br/>NBOS Online Exchange<br/>Fractal Mapper integrates with NBOS&rsquo;s web based map sharing system, NBOS Online Exchange. Right from within Fractal Mapper you can upload your maps to the map sharing site. As easily as saving maps to disk, you can now upload and share your maps with others!<br/><br/>"}, "104258": {"boardgamedesigner": ["7.7"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Million", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "2001", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Bertrand B\u00e8s"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Darwin Project"], "boardgameversion": ["Backstab magazine edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Miniatures", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Million is a tabletop game of futuristic combat between fighters in high-tech combat armor.

These counters also represent the armor's &quot;hit points&quot;: once a player runs out of counters, the armor is considered to be too badly damaged and the player is off the game.<br/><br/>Each player then makes three piles of face-down counters (one for each system), put her figure in one corner and play begins.<br/><br/>Each turn, each player secretly chooses two of three systems to activate (Mobility and Offence for example). Players then reveal their choices, draw enough counters from their activated systems to replenish their hand to five counters, and roll a d10 for initiative (players can expend counters to gain a bonus on the initiative roll). Each player then take an action, alternating between players until there are no possible actions left or each player passes, at which point another turn begins. Each player can take a move action and a shoot action each turn, and also play counters as an action.<br/><br/>Damage is resolved by rolling on a damage table with a lot of different results (loss of counters, fighter pushed back and/or stunned...).

The dealer then picks up the Crib and scores it for all possible points.  Then the cards are shuffled, the deal alternates, and the process is repeated.

The game is an RPG that blends certain shooter aspects into the combat system. The development team released updates, called &quot;Deployments,&quot; nearly every month since launch. The game required monthly subscription.<br/><br/>Tabula Rasa was about humanity's last stand against a group of aliens called the Bane. The story took place in the near future on two planets, Arieki and Foreas, which were in a state of constant conflict between the AFS (Allied Free Sentients) and the Bane. The term tabula rasa means scraped tablet or clean slate in Latin, which refers to a fresh start, or starting over.<br/><br/>According to the developers, the game included the ability for players to influence the outcome of a war between the player characters and the NPCs.<br/><br/>Tabula Rasa closed on February 28, 2009, with servers slated to become free to play on January 10, 2009, but were set as three weeks earlier by the developers.<br/><br/>Background:<br/><br/>There once was an advanced alien species known as the Eloh. They freely shared the knowledge of Logos, the power to convert between matter and energy with just the mind, to less advanced races. One of these less advanced races, the Thrax, used this power to wage war against the Eloh, a war which the Eloh won but at a great cost. This led to a great divide in the Eloh. One faction wanted to keep on spreading the knowledge as they had before. The other, called the Neph, sought to control the development of &quot;lesser races&quot; as to ensure they, the Neph, would always be the superior species. This inner conflict led the Neph faction to leave the Eloh and seek other allies, among them the defeated Thrax; this species along with others joined to form the Bane, which is controlled by the Neph.<br/><br/>As one of their first acts, they attacked the Eloh world; the surviving Eloh fled and were scattered among the worlds they had previously visited. The Bane attacked Earth sometime in our near future. Humanity was hopelessly outmatched and the majority was completely wiped out. Luckily, the Eloh had left behind some of their technology that had the ability to make wormholes to other worlds. There, humans found other species doing the same thing they had, fighting against the Bane to survive. They banded together to form the Army of the Allied Free Sentients to fight against the Bane.<br/><br/>According to information from the game's manual, it's been roughly 5 years since Earth was attacked. It was eventually discovered that Earth had not been destroyed as once thought, but had instead become a massive staging ground for the Bane. From there they strengthened their forces and increased attacks upon the AFS.<br/><br/>"}, "104298": {"poll": [], "name": "Buccaneer: The Pursuit of Infamy", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1066232.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Ocean / Sea", "Pirates"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Stickmen Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Arcade", "Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "3", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Blitz Games Studios"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1066232_t.jpg", "description": "Buccaneer is a single and multiplayer game where players strive to become the most infamous pirate captain of all time and etch their name in The Hall of Infamy.

The game was later released for Windows PC-CDROM and on the PlayStation Network.<br/><br/>Motorhead is a moody arcade racing game set in quasi-futuristic urban environments. The cars available for play are reminiscent of  sports cars of the late 1990s. 10 cars are available to chose (three initially selectable, seven hidden) and eight courses, only two of which can be selected prior to unlocking. Modes include: time trial, single race, league play, a ghost mode and two player split-screen. Latter PC versions added 2 more cars and allowed the play of tracks in reverse.<br/><br/>Handling, while exaggerated, was more physics based than arcade racers of the time. Proper line and keeping the car on the edge of tire grip is rewarded with more speed through corners. However; speed loss for sliding and crashing is not greatly penalized either. There is no damage modeling of crashes for cars or environment. Steering wheel and force feedback support was added in the PC versions.<br/><br/>Music consists of 10 tracks of mostly electronic music, composed by the Swedish video game music composer Olof Gustafsson (also known as Blaizer). The lack of commentary audio was applauded by game critics as it enhanced the moody racing experience. Motorhead on Windows was one of the first racing games to adopt 3D sound.<br/><br/>The game was nominated for the BAFTA Interactive award for &quot;Best Computer Programming&quot; in October 1998 and has so far sold more than one million copies.<br/><br/>"}, "104328": {"poll": [], "name": "The Premiership", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["PC & Compatibles"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Sports - Soccer"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Codemasters"], "videogamegenre": ["Management"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Codemasters"], "description": "Back of Box:<br/><br/>This game has ALL the features which go to make THE BEST EVER football manager game!<br/><br/>"}, "104329": {"rpgartist": ["Adam Denton", "David Lee Ingersoll", "Bradley McDevitt", "Marco Primo"], "rpgitemversion": ["Gen Con 2011 Pre-Publication Proof Edition", "PDF version", "Softcover Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Mythic Iceland", "rpghonor": ["2013 ENnie for Best Setting - Silver Winner"], "rpgproducer": ["Kairam Hamdan", "Le\u00f3 P\u00e1ll Hrafnasson", "Meghan McLean"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1527113.png", "usersrated": "9", "rpgsetting": ["Mythic Iceland"], "rpgdesigner": ["Pedro Ziviani"], "average": "8", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Basic RolePlaying"], "rpgpublisher": ["Chaosium"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Scenario / Adventure / Module", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["History (Vikings)", "Mythology / Folklore"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1527113_t.png", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Mythic Iceland brings to life the world of the Icelandic Sagas and fairy tales.<br/><br/>The Nordic and Celtic peoples settled Iceland in the 9th century coming from lands with rich traditions of folklore, where the mythical and supernatural are part of daily life.

MHP3 was released in Japan on December 1st, 2010. In this latest version of Monster Hunter, the producers focused heavily on graphics, details on maps and monsters.<br/>The new base of operations is Yukumo Village. This village has a feudal Japanese feel to it, both from its design to its residents. The player can take two Felynes out with him/her on a single player quest, up from the single companion of Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. When you take Felynes out on quests, monster attacks are divided between the player and the companions, making hunts easier. Also new to Monster Hunter Portable 3rd is the ability to customize the Felyne companions' equipment. Doing so will change the creature's physical appearance and properties. The player will be able to customize the Felynes in three areas: weapon, head parts and torso parts. A new field introduced in the game is Mountain Stream (\u6e13\u6d41 Keiry\u016b?). All the hunting fields in Monster Hunter Tri, along with the addition of the Mountain Stream field are included in Monster Hunter Portable 3rd. Underwater quests, however, have been completely removed, therefore maps such as the Deserted Island and Flooded Forest have been revised to work around this.[3][4] Not all monsters from Monster Hunter Tri are present in Monster Hunter Portable 3rd - Lagiacrus, Gobul, and Ceadeus have been removed. Jinouga, the flagship monster of the game is shown on the cover art.<br/><br/>The Guild Hall now features a hot spring, similar to the Felyne Kitchen from previous games, which can be upgraded by clearing special 'Hot Spring Quests' which upgrade the effects of the hot spring, as well as the Felyne Whim Skills, which can now be chosen and selected by the player.<br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Hunter_Portable_3rd,&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Hunter_Portable_3rd,&qu...</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "104333": {"rpgdesigner": ["John E.

You can airlift a vehicle out of an airfield, too, to save the driver, but then you have fewer opportunities to save more people.<br/><br/>Each turn proceeds as follows:<br/><br/><br/>    Radiation outburst &ndash; Roll the eight-sided die and place a radiation counter on the numbered reactor (or nowhere if an 8 is rolled).<br/>    Move buses &ndash; In player order, move a bus up to two spaces, with a maximum of four passengers at any one time. You can pick up and drop your color-coded passengers as you wish. Vehicles can't enter a reactor hex and can't end the turn in the same space as another player's vehicle (except the airfield, which holds any number of vehicles).<br/>    Radiation outburst &ndash; Same as above.<br/>    Move cars &ndash; Same movement rules, but cars can move up to three spaces while holding at most three passengers.<br/>    Radiation reparation &ndash; Roll the eight-sided die, then remove a radiation counter (if present) from the numbered reactor.<br/>    Move helicopters &ndash; Same movement rules, but helicopters can move up to four spaces while holding at most two passengers.<br/>    Radiation sickness &ndash; People next to a reactor absorb 1 Sievert radiation (1 Sv) for each counter on a reactor. People one space away absorb that many Sv minus one; people two spaces away absorb that many minus two; and so on. A person can absorb radiation from more than one reactor.<br/><br/><br/>When a person's token absorbs 1 Sv, lay it on its side to show that it's ill; when it absorbs 2 Sv, lay it on its back (very ill); a person absorbing 3 Sv or more dies and is removed. Radiation sickness is cumulative. People stay in their positions even after being evacuated. Vehicle drivers die only if they absorb 3 Sv or more from a single reactor in a single turn.<br/><br/>The start player position rotates each round. The game ends immediately when one reactor receives a fifth counter or a 16th counter is to be placed on the game board. The player who has rescued the most people wins. In case of a tie, the player with more healthy people wins, with subsequent ties being broken by the number of ill vs. very ill people.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual first edition", "SimplyFun Edition"], "name": "Meltdown 2020", "playingtime": "40", "boardgamemechanic": ["Modular Board", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Simulation"], "average": "6.16696", "usersrated": "168", "age": "8", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Ludology Episode 51 - 50 for 50, Part 2", "Wooden Cubes &amp; Iron Soldiers: \u201cJust the Two of Us\u201d Episode 8"]}, "104343": {"poll": [], "name": "Delicious", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Downloadable Windows edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1063158.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Delicious"], "videogametheme": ["Business/Construction", "Food / Cooking"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Zylom"], "videogamegenre": ["Management"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "7", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Zylom"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1063158_t.jpg", "description": "Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>Have you always dreamed of opening your own restaurant?

The chaotic streets hum with the sounds of bustling crowds and busy commerce. Cargo ships constantly arrive and depart from the port. Demand is continuous, if unpredictable, for a supply of local products such as exotic fruits, sugar, rum, tobacco, and cigars.<br/><br/>In Santiago de Cuba, your business card says &quot;broker&quot;, but in reality you're a shady wheeler-dealer who arranges deals with the locals and with corruptible officials to move goods and meet the demand of those ever-present cargo ships &ndash; and your ability to procure these goods is only as reliable as your &quot;connections&quot;.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, nine locals &ndash; the Cubans &ndash; are randomly arranged on a path around Santiago, with the port being the tenth location on the circuit. Each Cuban has a different ability: e.g., give a player two tobacco, give a player a good of his choice, force opponents to give you something, give money or victory points (VPs), and seize a building or allow a player to use a previously seized building. What are these buildings? At the start of the game, twelve buildings are randomly placed on the game board in four color-coded groups (white, yellow, etc.) of three. As with the Cubans, these buildings give players a special ability when used: convert tobacco to cigars, change VPs to money or vica versa, increase the value of goods delivered to the ship, render a Cuban inactive for the next round, and so on.<br/><br/>Players will deliver goods to seven ships throughout the course of the game. The demand for each ship is determined via a die roll; the active player rolls five dice &ndash; one for each type of good &ndash; then chooses four of the values rolled to represent demand for goods of the same color as the die.<br/><br/>All players share a car and travel around the island together. On a turn, the active player can move the car to the next location on the path (whether Cuban or port) for free, or pay one peso for each spot moved beyond that. After taking a Cuban action, the player then must move his player piece to a building of the same color as the flower on that Cuban. If he takes an action in a building owned by someone else, that player earns 1 VP. (One Cuban allows a player to use the same building where his piece is currently located.)<br/><br/>If a player moves to port, players take turns delivering all goods of one type to the ship to meet demand, adjusting the demand dice as needed. A player earns 2-4 VP for each good delivered; a player doesn't have to deliver goods. If the ship's demand isn't met after everyone delivers or passes, the VP bounty per good is increased by one and the ship remains in place &ndash; unless the value was already at 4 VP, in which case the ship sails. In this case, or when all the demand is met, a new ship comes into port with new demand values.<br/><br/>After seven ships have sailed, the players earn 1 VP for every three goods still on hand, then tally their VPs. The player with the most VPs wins, with ties broken by goods remaining, then money.<br/><br/>Each game poses new tactical challenges for the players, thanks to ever-changing combinations of buildings, Cuban inhabitants and demand for goods.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition", "English/German edition", "French edition", "Greek edition", "Hungarian edition", "Polish edition", "Russian edition", "Spanish edition"], "average": "6.94409", "name": "Santiago de Cuba", "videogamebg": ["Santiago de Cuba"], "playingtime": "75", "boardgamemechanic": ["Commodity Speculation", "Dice Rolling", "Memory", "Modular Board", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Point to Point Movement", "Worker Placement"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["149308", "149307", "149306", "149309"], "usersrated": "3239", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games", "Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Cities: Santiago, Cuba", "Country: Cuba", "Eggertspiele Cuba series"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 72 March Craziness Dice Game Style Part 1", "Exploring Games, Episode 11: Exploring Game Mechanics", "Santiago de Cuba (Pegasus Spiele): Spiele-Podcast.de Nr. 131", "The One About Spies Like Us", "The Short One About PAX East 2012", "The Spiel at Essen 2011 - Eggertspiele"]}, "104349": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Allan Harms", "Brian Parker"], "poll": [], "name": "Pillow Talk: The Sensual Relationship Game", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Partnerships", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1060273_t.jpg", "average": "8", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Copulus"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1060273.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Mature / Adult", "Racing", "Trivia"], "age": "18", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "From the publisher:<br/>Pillow Talk: The Sensual Relationship Game is a personal growth game, which uses sexuality to help couples resolve personal and relationship issues.<br/><br/>The purpose of Pillow Talk is to:<br/><br/>    Inspire and initiate intimate conversation between couples.<br/>    Help couples practice open and honest communication and their relationship and sexuality.<br/>    Increase couples intimate knowledge of themselves and their partners.<br/>    Learn how to &lsquo;let go&rsquo; of past experiences, issues, and patterns in loving relationships.<br/>    Help individuals and couples work through and &lsquo;let go&rsquo; of the most common issues that arise in any intimate relationship.<br/>    Spoil, pamper, and treat couples to sensual and erotic interplay.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Pillow Talk: The Sensual Relationship Game is modeled after the ancient race game, &lsquo;Snakes and Ladders.&rsquo; However, with Pillow Talk, players go up &lsquo;whips&rsquo; and down &lsquo;chains&rsquo; to the appropriate square.

Set 3,000 years before the events of Twilight Imperium, Rex tells the story of the last days of the Lazax empire, while presenting players with compelling asymmetrical racial abilities and exciting opportunities for diplomacy, deception, and tactical mastery.<br/><br/>In Rex: Final Days of an Empire, players vie for control of vital locations across a sprawling map of the continent-sized Mecatol City. Only by securing three key locations (or more, when allied with other factions) can a player assert dominance over the heart of a dying empire.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, mustering troops in the face of an ongoing Sol blockade is difficult at best (unless, of course, you are the Federation of Sol or its faithless ally, the Hacan, who supply the blockading fleet). Savvy leaders must gather support from the local populace, uncover hidden weapon caches, and acquire control over key institutions. Mechanically, this means players must lay claim to areas that provide influence, which is then &quot;spent&quot; to (among other things) smuggle military forces through the orbiting Sol blockade. Those forces will be needed to seize the key areas of the city required to win the game. From the moment the first shot is fired, players must aggressively seek the means by which to turn the conflict to their own advantage.<br/><br/>While the great races struggle for supremacy in the power vacuum of a dead emperor, massive Sol warships execute their devastating bombardments of the city below. Moving systematically, the Federation of Sol's fleet of warships wreaks havoc on the planet's surface, targeting great swaths of the game board with their destructive capabilities. Only the Sol's own ground forces have forewarning of the fleet's wrath; all others must seek shelter in the few locations with working defensive shields...or be obliterated in the resulting firestorm.<br/><br/>Although open diplomacy and back-door dealmaking can often mitigate the need for bloodshed, direct combat may prove inevitable. When two or more opposing forces occupy the same area, a battle results. Each player's military strength is based on the sum total of troops he is willing to expend, along with the strength rating of his chosen leader. A faction's leaders can therefore be vitally important in combat...but beware! One or more of your Leaders may secretly be in the employ of an enemy, and if your forces in combat are commanded by such a traitor, defeat is all but assured. So whether on the field of battle or the floor of the Galactic Council, be careful in whom you place your trust.<br/><br/>All this, along with a host of optional rules and additional variants, means that no two games of Rex: Final Days of an Empire will play exactly alike. Contributing further to replayability is the game's asymmetrical faction abilities, each of which offer a unique play experience.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["Chinese first edition", "English first edition", "French edition", "German first edition", "Spanish first edition"], "average": "7.15304", "name": "Rex: Final Days of an Empire", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Auction/Bidding", "Hand Management", "Partnerships", "Point to Point Movement", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "14", "usersrated": "3252", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games", "Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Twilight Imperium"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["AP Podcast \u2013 Episodio 13: Android Netrunner", "Board2Death Podcast Episode 5 - Introductions Round One", "D6G Ep 98: Wishes for Game Industry &amp; Rex: Final Days of an Empire Detailed Review", "Ep 20 Top 5 Games", "Ep. 17 Nazca Games With Emerson Matsuuchi", "Episode 01: Introductions", "Episode 17 - Is That A Meeple In Your Pocket?", "Episode 19 - Cold Cold Cold!", "Episode 38 \u2013 Rex", "Episode 96- Railroad Revolution", "Episodio 8 \u2013 A Victory Denied y \u00bfqu\u00e9 son los wargames?", "LamasLive \u2013 Der Nachschlag!", "Low Player Count - Ep. 10 - The Digital Mail Bag", "OBG 78: The Summerer of Games", "Podcast #14: That Heart-Restarting Moment", "The Gaming Gang Extra 22: Gen Con Raw!

All tiles in the center of the table are square.<br/><br/>Each player receives four round tiles at random from a set of 32 that match the candy and color options on the square tiles. On your turn, you turn over one of your round tiles and a square tile. If they match in both candy and color, both tiles stay face up and you take another turn; if not, you turn both tiles face down again.<br/><br/>The little twist is that on your turn you can rob candies from your opponents.

But who will be the most successful in avoiding the troglodytes and bigger monsters, while going for the fattest treasures, or even better, the legendary rings of power?<br/><br/>The card deck in TSCHAK! is composed of twelve wizards (blue), twelve warriors (green), twelve dwarfs (red) and four artifacts (purple). Before the first round, a player receives three wizards, warriors and dwarfs and one artifact. (When playing with fewer than four players, deal out hands to virtual players; these are not used during the current round.) Set up the keep by placing one monster and one treasure tile face up on each of the three levels.<br/><br/>Players now assault the keep, trying to avoid the monsters and claim treasure. On the first level, players choose one card from their hand, reveal it, choose another, reveal it, choose a third, and reveal it. A player must create a team of adventurers with three different colors, and the strengths of these teams (the sum of the cards' values) are then compared. (The chameleon wizard with a ? equals the strongest wizard on the table. The artifact doubles the weakest character on your team.) The weakest team gets the monster card, which costs points, and the strongest team gets the treasure card, usually positive points. Ties are broken in favor of the strongest wizard, then in favor of the wizard with the wand, then the strongest warrior, and so on.<br/><br/>On the second level, players reveal one card, then a pair of cards, then compare strengths. On the third level, players reveal three cards at the same time. Players then compare the last card in hand, gaining 0-3 gold depending on the strength of that final card.<br/><br/>Once all ten cards have been played, each player passes his whole hand to his left neighbour, a new dungeon is created, and you now play with the same cards as the player sitting to your right. After four rounds, the game ends and players tally their points. Some treasures and monsters are worth a set number of positive or negative points; others are worth the square of the number of them you've collected (whether positive or negative); additional treasures have special abilities, like eliminating one monster card from the tiles you've collected. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Good hand management, double-guessing, a tad of luck, and the victory is yours!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual first edition"], "name": "TSCHAK!", "playingtime": "40", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Hand Management", "Memory", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "654", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "average": "6.41197", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Tschak!

Once all twelve rooms are placed, any door that does not lead to another room is a way out. The first player to escape the maze, wins!<br/><br/>You will roll 2 to 5 six-sided dice to perform the following actions: OPEN, MOVE, SEARCH, HIDE, HELP or ATTACK. Throughout the game, you will search for HAND cards and try to avoid SKULL cards. HAND cards (Useful, Useless and Charmed items) help you defeat the maze, influence others, intimidate them, or just plain force them to do your will. SKULL cards (Bad Scares, Devious Traps, Wicked Hexes and Dark Entities) await those who roll below 9. Skulls can kill you or drive you insane.<br/><br/>In this game, you are YOU.
