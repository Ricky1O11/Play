Throughout the land various factions vie for power over each other, such as the supposedly noble Order of the Rose or the terrifying Doom Guard. And presiding over the world outside Kilforth is the ever-present Overlord, Masklaw. Over the coming month, a deadly Gloom will descend upon Kilforth,which the Heroes must Battle through to prove their worth, defeat an Ancient evil, and save the land from darkness.<br/> Gloom of Kilforth is a card game of high fantasy with a Gothic edge, playable in 1-3 hours, where 1-4 players, working individually or together, must take their humble adventurers on a journey through a dark world of magic and peril. They will visit strange places, stranger people and overcome powerful enemies in their mission to discover mysterious artefacts and mystical Spells. Players follow their Hero&rsquo;s tale from modest beginnings through an epic story to an exciting climactic battle for the fate of the world. Gloom of Kilforth takes about 45 minutes per player to play.<br/><br/>The following is taken from my design journal:<br/><br/>This game has been in development for a long time and has undergone so many permutations in the last six years that I&rsquo;ve literally ripped it up and started again numerous times.  From board game, to miniatures game, to proto-RPG I&rsquo;ve finally settled on a format I hope will be cost effective and elegant: the card game.<br/> Gloom of Kilforth sees 1-4 players taking a humble adventurer on a journey through a dark world of magic and peril and following their tale from modest beginnings through an epic story to an exciting climactic battle for the fate of the world.<br/> Drawing inspiration from titles we&rsquo;ve already seen like combat-heavy tactical dungeon crawls (Descent, D&amp;D, etc.), condensed overland adventures concerned either with combat (Runebound) or random encounters (Talisman), games that stretch into story-telling (Tales of the Arabian Nights), cooperative games against insurmountable odds (Arkham Horror, Defenders of the Realm), and tactical adventure card games (Lord of the Rings: The Card Game), I&rsquo;ve always been looking to design a game that distils the heroic story telling of an in-depth role playing game down into an amount of time that&rsquo;s playable in an evening.  It&rsquo;s something that many of us crave as we get older and have kids and relationships and jobs and so on which preclude us from throwing all that time away on months of role-playing games.<br/> So whilst I wanted to include all the high fantasy stuff that many of us love, and which in many ways mostly stems from Tolkien&rsquo;s work, I also tried to develop new techniques of weaving them together to create story-based gameplay.<br/> The two key drivers for the game are the Saga Chapters and Night card decks.  The Sagas represent the tales that the heroes will tell as they progress on their journey to fame and fortune, whilst the Night cards are global events that can affect everyone in the Kingdom.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "8.0319", "name": "Gloom of Kilforth: A Fantasy Quest Game", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Modular Board", "Role Playing", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "58", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Solitaire Games"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 040 \u2013 Airecon 4"]}, "98528": {"rpgartist": ["Myke Amend", "JP Valdecantos Anfuso", "A.

As such, the Saga Machine core rulebook is necessary to make full use of this work.<br/><br/>By default, the Trystell: Reborn setting makes use of four of the five modules found within the main Saga Machine book: the Combat Module, the Environment Module, the Mental Module and the Social Module.<br/><br/>The only module not in use by default is the Character Design Module. While GMs may still use this module for character creation, if they wish, with no ill effects, it's function has been largely replaced by the Lifepath Module introduced later on in this work.<br/><br/>Specific options for the different core modules in use are detailed below:<br/><br/>Baseline Game: Values given in this book will use the Imperial system of measurement, as for better or worse, that is the most commonly used measurement system where the author of this book resides. In addition, the Trystell setting assumes that the GM is making use of the optional Skill trait, with the default skill list provided in the Saga Machine core rulebook.<br/><br/>Combat Module: This text will assume that the GM has chosen to make use of a hex combat grid, and the optional Bleeding rule.<br/><br/>Mental Module: The Trystell setting makes use of different Power Access traits than the example ones given in the Saga Machine rulebook. Most available Power Access traits use the default power use and power strain rules, but are penalized by encumbrance, and access to their granted powers are restricted by Level. Finally, the GM section of this book should have more information on corruption.<br/><br/>Social Module: By default this book assumes that the campaign is making use of the standard wealth rules, without the option for continuing income. Similarly, this work assumes that the GM is not making use of the optional Recognition trait. Using both of these options is quite reasonable, however, and may be and may be quite suited to a campaign centered around the new Core City (Melanoc), and the outlined campaign presented in the GM's section of this book. Finally, Trystell is considered to generally be a Progress Level 5 world, with an average Control Rating of 2 or 3 (albeit that varies a lot with the region).<br/><br/>"}, "98531": {"rpgartist": ["Ralph Horsley", "Danny O'Neill"], "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover version"], "poll": [], "name": "Assault on Darkspyre", "rpgdesigner": ["Danny O'Neill"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1002172.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgproducer": ["Danny O'Neill"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Hammerdog Games"], "average": "0", "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Building Block Adventures"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1002172_t.jpg", "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>Invade the Tower of an Archmage!<br/><br/>&quot;...and so it stands today, this evil magical fortress.

Conceived of late in 2009 as part an initiative to explore the boundaries of what was possible in the Saga Machine system, Shadows Over Sol is the second setting released for the game, and the first to take Saga Machine into the realm of science fiction and outer space.<br/><br/>Space &amp; Horror<br/>Shadows Over Sol borrows themes and elements from the horror genre, in addition to the science fiction genre, and in many ways space is the perfect setting for horror. Space is alien, isolating and quite hostile to human life. It gets characters outside of their comfort zone, separated from all the usual safety nets that they could normally fall back on in society. This isolation forces characters to take matters of survival into their own hands, even if those hands aren't an expert at the task.<br/><br/>Using space as a set-piece for horror provides a variety of tools and features that can be used to further the mood of horror as the player characters struggle to survive: Communications could be cut off. Life support could begin to fail. Sensors could be damaged. Thrusters could be sabotaged, leaving a ship a long, long voyage home. Unexpected things could happen while a character is in hibernation. And, of course, there could be things out there.<br/><br/>Player Characters<br/>Shadows Over Sol is a setting filled with many competing interests, shadowy organizations and secret conspiracies. All of these groups have the need for small bands of agents to covertly do their dirty work, any one of these groups might hire the player characters. Out there in space a thousand things could be happening, all unknown to the population back home &mdash; a population that wants to stay fed and comfortable in its ignorance.<br/><br/>Shadows Over Sol by default assumes that player characters are members of one of these freelance teams, working for different organizations. This gives the game master a structure to build sessions around&mdash;missions on behalf of one of these entities &mdash; and player characters the agency in deciding which missions to take and which organizations they feel comfortable working for. Naturally, however, more dangerous missions come with greater rewards. But even the more innocuous-seeming mission could have unforeseen deadly twists lurking in the darkness of space.<br/><br/>"}, "98533": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Dan Verssen"], "poll": [], "name": "Down in Flames: Aces High \u2013 Extra Decks", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2008", "boardgameexpansion": ["Down in Flames: Aces High"], "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": ["Down in Flames"], "maxplayers": "12", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1003705_t.jpg", "average": "6.66667", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Dan Verssen Games (DVG)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1003705.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Aviation / Flight", "Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Wargame", "World War II"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "The card decks contained in the Down In Flames - Aces High game will accommodate up to 6 players.

Magic, action, danger, combat, treasure, heroes, villains, gold and fame can all be found there. Elements of fantasy such as gnomes, dwarves, elves, minotaur and orcs can be found as well. Yet, in many ways Trystell is a world like our own. Plants, animals, greed, prejudice, honor, humor and deceit can be found within its bounds. Trystell is a setting ideally suited for heroic drama. It is a place where hopes, dreams, fears and ambitions await the eager adventurer. Good battles evil. Heroic adventurers fight sinister villains in epic battles, although sometimes things are a little more gray and the lines between hero an villain become blurred. Good luck in your journey into the fascinating world of Trystell.<br/><br/>How Trystell Differs From Other d20 Games<br/>Trystell has a number of unique elements that distinguish it from other fantasy d20 games. Not only does the world has its own unique flavor, it has a blend of high fantasy, impossible technology and more advanced academic theorems.<br/><br/>In addition to mere setting differences, Trystell also has a number of different variations from the standard d20 game mechanics. The following list is by no means complete, however, it should offer an overview of the most important mechanic chances for the experienced d20 player.<br/><br/>     The Trystell setting offers a number of new races, classes and feats. In addition, the Trystell settings overhauls several existing classes.<br/>     The Trystell game utilizes a system of determining the contacts and allies of player characters, their reputations in the game world and a system of increasing unarmed AC as a character gains levels.<br/>     Characters in the Trystell setting have Vitality and Wound points instead of Hit Points. This provides a more realistic and gritty feel to combat.<br/>     The Trystell game utilizes character options called Traits and Flaws. Traits are packages taken at character creation that helps define a characters&rsquo; strengths and weaknesses; flaws are kind of like anti-feats that grant characters bonus feats for taking a weakness.<br/>     The Trystell setting uses a different system for determining magic. Instead of having set spell slots, a spellcaster has a pool of spell points from which she casts spells.<br/>     Player characters in the Trystell setting have a mechanic resource known as Action Points.<br/>     There are no true alignments on Trystell. Instead characters have a trait called Allegiance.<br/>     Armor on Trystell provides not just a bonus to AC, but a bonus to defense as well.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "98535": {"rpgdesigner": ["Kevin Butler", "Carter Newton"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version", "Softcover version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Terror at Camp Waka'Naka", "rpgartist": ["Ione Damasco", "Steve Johnson", "Matt Kish", "Chris Newman"], "rpgproducer": ["Leighton Connor", "Alice Connor", "Stacy Stroud"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1478562.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Horror"], "rpgpublisher": ["Hex Games (I)"], "rpg": ["QAGS (Quick Ass Game System)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1478562_t.png", "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>Almost two hundred years ago George Washington wrote about the land that would become Camp Waka'Naka. &quot;The wildlife is abundant, the climate pleasing, and the river tranquil and soothing.&quot; Washington didn't anticipate the deranged psychopath now on the loose.

It dates back to the very beginnings of Tab Creations, back to 1993, when Tab Creations' focus was still primarily on comics and not on role-playing games.<br/><br/>In those early days the setting began with a handful of superheroes created by the various members of the Collective , and then a variety of supervillains were created to combat them. From there the setting began to grow, remaining Tab Creations' biggest focus until 1998, when work began on the Swords &amp; Arrows Role-Playing Game and the Trystell fantasy setting. Even then it was intended that the Zeotis would get its own roleplaying game using the same system. Plans were drawn up, yet they never came to fruition, and the Zeotis slowly fell by the wayside. Until now!<br/><br/>Since those early days the Zeotis setting has undergone at least two major revisions, as well as major expansions and oversight to add some degree of continuity and internal consistency to the setting &mdash;although it is a supers setting, and in the supers genre, bold characters and larger-than-life personalities loom larger than mere setting verisimilitude.<br/><br/>So here it is. Welcome to the first official release of the the Zeotis setting in a role-playing game format. Designed for use with our Saga Machine rules system, this booklet &mdash; along with the Saga Machine core rulebook &mdash; should contain everything you need to write and run your own campaign set in the Zeotis universe.<br/><br/>So go find some players, come up with some colorful concepts and get your game stared. We hope you enjoy the ride.<br/><br/><br/>Themes &amp; Assumptions<br/><br/>There is something of a paradox at the core of any supers role-playing game setting: Supers settings by long-standing tradition focus first and foremost on the lives, powers and personalities of their star characters. In any individual title, the themes and personalities of that title take precedent over any continuity and themes for the supers world as a whole. And in a supers game, that's perhaps as it should be.<br/><br/>Because of that, supers role-playing settings benefit from being somewhat &ldquo;generic,&rdquo; so as to allow player characters and their personal themes to easily assume that title role and limelight in the setting. It should be noted then that while this booklet details a number of cannon elements to the Zeotis setting, and a number of signature characters, they are meant to be used as background by the GM. While it might be interesting to have one of the cannon superheroes guest star for the session &mdash; or even be a sympathetic antagonistic for a session &mdash; these signature characters should not overshadow the player characters of the campaign, and at the end of the day, should retire back to somewhere in the background.<br/><br/>All things being equal, though, the Zeotis setting was written to have some underlying sets of assumptions to it. There are a wide range of supers stories out there, and the basic themes and assumptions of supers universes has changed many times over their long history.<br/><br/>That said, the Zeotis setting has something of a &quot;Bronze Age&quot; feel to it. Heroes are larger than life, although not as absurdly powerful as the heroes of the &quot;Silver Age.&quot; Darker social issues and circumstances are not shied away from, yet heroes are generally still recognizably heroes&mdash;with their bright costumes and their altruistic agendas &mdash; not really the brooding anti-heroes of the &quot;Iron Age.&quot;<br/><br/>If these terms for the different eras of supers confuse you, don't worry. They get described in detail later in this booklet.<br/><br/><br/>Modules<br/><br/>Naturally, this booklet is meant for use with the Saga Machine role-playing system. And as a Saga Machine product, a variety of optional modules are used to create the feel of a supers setting. Which modules and options are in use are detailed below.<br/><br/>     Supers Module: A new module presented in this booklet, the Super Module details a variety of new rules meant to emulate the supers genre, as well as tweaking the options used by the other modules.<br/>     Character Design Module: The Character Design Module is fully in use for the Zeotis setting, albeit with a number of new options presented by the Supers Module. Of note are the various supers arrays for generating stats, and the bid system for super power limitations.<br/>     Combat Module: The combat module is, of course, in use, as spectacular combats are a staple of the genre. Of the Combat Module options, both the Hit Points variant and abstract movement are turned on.<br/>     Environment Module: The Environment Module presented in the Saga Machine core rulebook is not used. It is largely replaced by the Supers Module.<br/>     Mental Module: The Mental Module is in use, although a new variant on the usual Focus and Composure Track in in use, and presented as part of the Super Module.<br/>     Social Module: While the Abstract Wealth system is poached by the Supers Module, the Social Module is not otherwise in use with the Zeotis setting.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "98577": {"rpgdesigner": ["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Armand", "Patrick Daug\u00e9", "Denis Gerfaud", "Martin Latallo", "Jean-Jacques Petit", "Jacques Rauer", "Jean Ricard", "Pierre Stutin"], "statistics": [], "name": "Casus Belli (Issue 17 - Oct 1983)", "rpgartist": ["Didier Guiserix"], "rpgproducer": ["Didier Guiserix", "Agn\u00e8s Pernelle"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic989901.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Casus Belli"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Ace of Aces", "Amiraut\u00e9", "Devine Que Vient D\u00eener Ce Soir...", "L'Appel de Call of Cthulhu", "La bataille du Carigliano", "Le Jardin d'Olphara", "Les Combats dans RuneQuest", "Ludotique", "Nocturne pour Violon", "Nouvelles du Front", "Prague", "Squad Leader - La Cavalerie", "War & Peace"], "rpg": ["Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (1st Edition)", "Call of Cthulhu (1st Edition)", "RuneQuest (1st & 2nd Editions)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Excelsior Publications"], "rpgissueversion": ["First edition"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic989901_t.png", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>In this issue:<br/><br/>* Nouvelles du Front<br/> * Prague, review of GDW's The Battle of Prague<br/> * War &amp; Peace, review of Avalon Hill's War and Peace<br/> * Amiraut&eacute;, introduction to Amiraut\u00e9<br/> * Squad Leader, analysis of the cavalry rules in SL, and a scenario<br/> * Ace of Aces, follow-up of the previous issue's article about Ace of Aces<br/> * La Bataille de Garigliano, rules, board and counters for the included game La Bataille du Garigliano<br/> * Devine qui vient diner ce soir, new monsters for AD&amp;D, and new magical items<br/> * Les Combats dans Runequest, analysis of Runequest's combat rules<br/> * Call of Cthulhu, review of Call of Cthulhu (1st Edition)<br/> * Nocturne pour Violon, scenario for Call of Cthulhu<br/> * Le Jardin d'Olphara, AD&amp;D module for a party of six 5-7th level characters<br/> * Ludotique, reviews of the video games Galactic Gladiators, Galactic Adventure and Death in the Caribbean<br/><br/>"}, "98578": {"poll": [], "name": "Sea Wolf / Bombardier", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Astrocade (Astrocade Inc.) edition", "North American Astrocade edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic994847.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Military"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Bally/Midway"], "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Bally Professional Arcade"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Astrocade, Inc.", "Bally/Midway"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic994847_t.jpg", "description": "Game Manual<br/><br/>Sea Wolf is a one or two player game.<br/><br/>The object of Sea Wolf is to score as many points as you can by sinking both the blue and yellow ships which cross your television screen.

When I create starships (like those featured here) I start with the ship construction guide in the back of the core book and then I go wild, writing in broad strokes to achieve the ship I wish to create.

For most, these known Runes have always been sufficient for any magical need.<br/><br/>But not everyone is satisfied with the accumulated knowledge. Rune hunters scour the planet, searching for the one new Rune that could give them incredible power or unimaginable wealth. For those who seek to dominate their fellow men, or who simply seek a life of excess, the promise of undiscovered Runes is a powerful lure.<br/><br/>Using This Book<br/>This book is divided into four sections. The first section is entitled New Runes, and details just that - six new effect Runes and two new control Runes, complete with spell descriptions. The second section, Advanced Runewords, expands upon the Runeword possibilities in the core book by presenting a larger group of advanced Runewords for your exceptionally skilled Runecasters. The third section, Runic Artifacts, provides a variety of Runed items to challenge or reward your players. The final chapter, Finding Runes, provides the gamemaster with several new ideas for working these Runes into a campaign, as well as a few adventures.<br/><br/>"}, "98692": {"rpgartist": ["Andrew Arconti", "Todd Arrington", "Carlos Cabrera", "Jim Cornell", "Kevin Debler", "Eric Deschamps", "Matt DiPietro", "Brian \"Chippy\" Dugan", "Emrah Elmasli", "Robert Hawkins", "Andrew Hou", "Ron Kruzie", "Karl Richardson", "Quentin Smith", "Brian Snoddy", "Florian Stitz", "Andrea Uderzo", "Chris Walton", "Eva Widermann", "Matt Wilson", "Sam Wood"], "statistics": [], "name": "No Quarter (Issue 20 - Sep 2008)", "rpgdesigner": ["Todd Arrington", "Dan Brandt", "Eric Cagle", "David Carl", "Jim Cornell", "Matt DiPietro", "Robert Hawkins", "Luke Johnson", "Ron Kruzie", "Andrew Lindstrom", "Doug Seacat", "Quentin Smith"], "rpgproducer": ["Christopher Bodan", "Eric Cagle", "Kevin Clark", "Robert Hawkins", "Nathan Letsinger", "Jason Soles", "Matt Wilson"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic991163.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "rpgissue": ["No Quarter"], "rpgissuearticle": ["All Roads Lead to Legends", "Bosun's Call", "Call to Arms: State of War", "Drawn & Quartered", "Fire in the Hole - Things that Go Bump in the Night", "Full Metal Challenge - Cryx Tricks", "Goin' Solo", "Guts & Gears - Bonejacks", "Guts & Gears Paint - Bonejack Variant", "Guts & Gears Tactics - Bonejack Tactics", "Modeling and Painting - (Rotted) Flesh and Bone and Metal", "Monsterpocalypse: Basic Strategy and Play", "New Releases - September & October", "News from the Front", "Painting Challenge - Encroaching Entropy", "Parts Bin - Heads", "Player Gallery", "Secrets of the Wild - Blighted Destruction", "Sign & Sigil - By Mortar, Pestle, and Grenade", "Terrain - Cryxian Bone Excavator", "The Gamers' Journal - Studio Showdown (part 4)", "The Gavyn Kyle Files - Baldur the Stonecleaver", "The Pendrake Encounters - The Machine Wraith", "The Poop Deck - The Bigger They Are..."], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Privateer Press"], "rpgissueversion": ["Magazine"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic991163_t.jpg", "description": "From Publisher Website:<br/><br/>No Quarter #20 contains more HORDES: Metamorphosis previews, bonejacks in Guts &amp; Gears and the Combat Alchemist in the Iron Kingdoms.<br/><br/>Cover Art &quot;Nightmare from WARMACHINE: Legends&quot; by Andrea Uderzo<br/><br/>ISSN: 7558200361<br/><br/>"}, "98693": {"rpgartist": ["Andrew Arconti", "Eric Deschamps", "Matt Dixon", "Emrah Elmasli", "Mark Gibbons", "Pat Ohta", "Marek Oko\u0144", "Karl Richardson", "Brian Snoddy", "Rob Strohmeyer", "Andrea Uderzo", "Brian Valenzuela", "Chris Walton", "Eva Widermann", "Matt Wilson", "Sam Wood"], "statistics": [], "name": "No Quarter (Issue 21 - Nov 2008)", "rpgdesigner": ["Simon Berman", "Christopher Bodan", "David Boeren", "Eric Cagle", "David Carl", "Robert Hawkins", "Luke Johnson", "Andrew Lindstrom", "Pat Ohta", "Brian Putnam", "Rob Strohmeyer"], "rpgproducer": ["Christopher Bodan", "Eric Cagle", "Robert Hawkins", "Nathan Letsinger", "Jason Soles", "Matt Wilson"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic991166.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "rpgissue": ["No Quarter"], "rpgissuearticle": ["2008 Formula P3 Grandmaster Painting Competition", "2008 Privateer Press Masters Championship", "Bosun's Call", "Drawn & Quartered", "Fire in the Hole - Changing of the Guard", "Full Metal Challenge - Whack-a-Beast", "Guts & Gears - The Seraph", "Guts & Gears Paint - Seraph Variant", "Guts & Gears Tactics - Seraph Tactics", "Hardcore, Hard Results", "HORDES Preview: The Coming Change", "Modeling and Painting Special - Hierarch Garrick Voyle: Modeling a Legend", "New Releases - November & December", "News from the Front", "Painting Challenge - Hiding in Plain Sight", "Parts Bin - Arms", "Player's Gallery", "Secrets of the Wild - Nature's Wrath (Circle Tactics)", "Terrain - Trollkin Krielstone Shrine", "The Gavyn Kyle Files - Eiryss", "The Pendrake Encounters - The Boatman", "The Poop Deck - More Convention Madness!", "Winds of Change"], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Privateer Press"], "rpgissueversion": ["Magazine"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic991166_t.jpg", "description": "From Publisher Website:<br/><br/>No Quarter #21 showcases the winners of the 2008 Forumula P3 Grandmaster Painting Competition and the winners of the Masters and Hardcore Championships.

In Constantinople, representatives from the most important aristocratic families vie for their favored to inherit the Emperor's ring and throne.<br/><br/>It is a futile and petty dispute as each family is not about to surrender the throne to any of the others, but they ultimately decide that the winner will be the one who's supported by most of the wealthiest cities of the empire. Every ambitious successor raises the banner of  his dynasty and begins the struggle to win over the cities that will secure him the throne.<br/><br/>Each family secretly chooses seven imperial cities that they will seek to control through the actions available to them: Commandment, Diplomacy, Exile, Trade, Garrison, Espionage, and Corruption. May the rightful heir arise!<br/><br/><br/>Nekken is a fantasy-themed implementation of this game using the exact same materials as Byzantio and with a map on the reverse side of the game board, giving a different game experience and essentially two games in one.<br/><br/>Four tribes have been living in peace for over 3000 years despite the ancient hatred of each other. United in the capital city Nekken, they slowly forgot their fear of the large volcano that looms over the metropolis &ndash; until the volcano erupted. Forced to abandon their homes, the tribes spread throughout the continent, facing danger in many forms while trying to establish new colonies. Their ancient hatred has also been awakened and now they must struggle to survive. However, they still need each other, a new cold war emerges in the shadow of the searing heat of the volcano.<br/><br/>In Nekken, each player takes the role of a leader of their tribe and tries to be the one who will prevail and become the ruler of this new society. The goal is to achieve prestige through the establishment of new and glorious cities, using actions to move their leader on the map, exploring, establishing cities, betraying friends to achieve their objective. Hopefully no other ruler intends on settling in the same place!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual first edition"], "average": "6.59932", "name": "Byzantio", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Paper-and-Pencil", "Secret Unit Deployment"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["Byzantio / Nekken: Event Set I"], "usersrated": "177", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games", "Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Byzantium", "Country: Greece", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 28 A Love Letter to Nate While In Byzantio"]}, "98741": {"poll": [], "name": "Pokol", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "1972", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Poker"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic994512_t.jpg", "average": "4.75", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ariel", "Games and Puzzles (magazine)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic994512.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Ariel version", "Games and Puzzles edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Number"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "A game obviously inspired by the Scrabble board, triple and double value squares are an important part of the game.<br/><br/>From 2 to 4 players take part.

It is inspired by classic &quot;post apocalyptic&quot; role playing games, most especially older edition of Gamma World and Metamorphosis Alpha, but also draws considerably from films like &quot;Wizards&quot;, comic books like &quot;Kamandi&quot;, and 1980s cartoons like &quot;Thundarr, The Barbarian&quot;. It is a game set in a world ravaged by war and now utterly transformed, a world where beasts walk on two legs and plot against humans, where plantmen walk side-by-side with robotic war machines, where even ordinary men and women can perform feats of extraordinary power. In this setting, you may face foes armed with everything from stone knives to high-tech death rays, you may battle simple bandits or gargantuan, lightning-breathing mutant crocodiles, you may explore ruined cities which reach across the horizon or slog through dense jungles. You may even look down on the ruined Earth from an orbital city, or find a sub-sea civilization still secure within its dome of synthetic diamond a foot thick.<br/><br/>While it draws stylistic inspiration from much older games, it uses rules from modern games... specifically, it is built on the rules for the Fourth Edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and this document assumes both possession of and familiarity with those rules, which are essential for play.<br/><br/>Earth Delta is designed to allow play in a variety of styles, from all-out gonzo to relatively serious. The nature of the rules system and the design choices mean that, regardless of style or tone, there will be a general focus on action, conflict, daring deeds, and dismal (but possibly hilarious) failures. It is possible to play campaign where a mutant rosebush shares genes with a spider and her allies are a rabbit obsessed with ancient science and a vicious robot nanny intent on &quot;disciplining&quot; any &quot;naughty&quot; enemies with a built-in sledgehammer, or you may have a campaign featuring only &quot;normal&quot; humans, struggling to survive and possibly rebuild the world. Earth Delta provides the rules; you decide how to apply them, how serious or silly you want to be.<br/><br/>This book contains the core rules, intended for players and DMs.<br/><br/><br/>DESIGN GOALS<br/><br/>Here are the goals I set forth when I began this project in February 2010, having no idea just how long it would take to get to the Beta state. These goals have not changed, and I believe Earth Delta meets them all, to varying degrees of completeness. The goals of Earth Delta are:<br/><br/>     Capture the spirit of old-style Gamma World, especially the first and second editions, and of the sources which inspired it or which seemed to draw inspiration from it: Hiero's Journey, Heinlein's Orphans Of The Sky, Metamorphosis Alpha, Kamandi, Thundarr, Wasteland, Fallout, and anything else with mutants and mayhem.<br/>     Create a game which is balanced and playable. This isn't a beer-and-pretzels game (though it can be) or one where you create &quot;wacky&quot; throwaway characters. Nor is it one where random luck determines if you're useful. One of the Unchanged is just as powerful as a winged grizzly bear with laser eyes.<br/>     Allow for the playing of winged grizzly bears with laser eyes.<br/>     Be balanced with standard 4e rules, so there's minimal work involved in taking creatures, or characters, from this game into D&amp;D.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Mad? They dared to call me mad? Well, we'll see how it goes.<br/><br/>BETA 1<br/>What you are holding in your hand... or, more probably, looking at on your screen... is the &quot;Beta&quot; version of the rules for Earth Delta. What this means is that the core mechanics are very unlikely to change. There has been some playtesting, and it's been determined things work well enough as a framework. What may change -- what almost certainly will change -- is small details, if an ability gives a +1 or a +2, if a power belongs in the third level or the seventh, if it should stun or daze, and so on.<br/><br/>This document focuses very heavily on the first ten levels of play, the &quot;Heroic Tier&quot;. There is quite a bit of material which goes beyond that, especially in the form of higher-level mutations and technological items, but the Earth Delta is really only &quot;complete&quot; to level 10... there are very few monsters, class powers, paragon paths, and so on beyond this level. As the Beta becomes more solid, more higher-level material will be added, and of course players and DMs are free to make their own... and send it to me, if they wish, for possible inclusion.<br/><br/>"}, "98755": {"rpgdesigner": ["Mark Allen", "Ian Bailey", "Jon Chandler", "Robert Dale", "Gary Ellison", "D.

He is the oldest living goblin in the Pipedream, the massive hot water and sewage system that survived being ejected from Solaris when that world was destroyed.

Similar in style to Operation Wolf, Alien Brigade tells the story of a soldier that is forced to do battle with aliens that are invading the planet and taking over the bodies of fellow soldiers in the process. One of the last releases for the Atari 7800, Alien Brigade is a sought after title due to its relative scarcity, above-average graphics and Nintendo-like gameplay.<br/><br/>Alien Brigade is 144K in size, making it one of the largest commercially released Atari 7800 games.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Like Operation Wolf, the game is played from the point of view of the soldier. The game scrolls horizontally in two directions as various enemy creatures, possessed soldiers, human vehicles and alien vehicles attack mercilessly. Alien Brigade can either be played with the Atari 7800 joystick or with an Atari light gun.<br/><br/>The game takes place over five scrolling levels. The initial mission is to rescue hostages from an enemy camp, but the game then progresses to a waterfront battle, an underwater melee, a showdown in an underground mine, and then a final mountaintop battle. Adding to the challenge, the player is must be careful not to accidentally shoot innocent bystanders.<br/><br/>Between levels, the player is briefed by the commanding officer, who advises of the situation and rates the player's performance in the level.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Alien Brigade&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>Game Manual<br/><br/>Aliens Brainwash Humans<br/><br/>Some of the guys in the barracks have been acting a little odd lately. You were assigned to a special task force investigating the soldiers' strange, almost alien behavior.<br/><br/>The investigation revealed the astounding fact that aliens from another dimension have invaded the Earth. The aliens have brainwashed soldiers into M-16 toting zombies who will instantly obey their alien masters. (Sort of like boot camp.)<br/><br/>Worse yet, some aliens have actually taken over the bodies of soldiers and civilians. Every day more humans are being mysteriously possessed or brainwashed.<br/><br/>You also discovered that the aliens possess a deadly secret weapon. If the aliens are not stopped, this weapon will brainswash the entire human population of Earth! Ok, so you realize that in most people the difference would go unnoticed; still, it is your job to try to save the people of Earth. Your task force must seek out all the alien fiends, destroy them, and save the Earth.<br/><br/>Think you can handle it? Your Alien Brigade quest leads you through five different scenarios of increasing difficulty.  Your mission is to blast aliens, rescue hostages, collect weapons and other helpful items, and stay alive! The bloodthirsty alien nasties are on to you. If you fail in your quest, the Earth is doomed.<br/><br/>Now don't you wish you'd listened to your mother and enrolled in law school?<br/><br/>"}, "98760": {"rpgartist": ["Joshua Diffey"], "rpgitemversion": ["Beta 1e release"], "statistics": [], "name": "Earth Delta Mutant Manual (Beta Release)", "rpgdesigner": ["Ian \"Lizard\" Harac"], "rpgproducer": ["Ian \"Lizard\" Harac"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic992750.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure", "Fantasy", "Science Fiction (Post Apocalypse)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpg": ["Earth Delta"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic992750_t.jpg", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>Those of you who have been following this project since its inception know it used to be one book, which was, sadly, growing beyond Word's ability to format and repaginate easily, not to mention turning into a PDF file more bloated than the Federal budget. Bah-dum-bum! (You liberals can substitute &quot;than the compensation for a Wall Street fat cat that leeches off the backs of the Workers&quot;). So, I've decided to split the book in twain, or possibly in clemens, and if you're just wandering in here from some other PDF and have no idea what to expect, let me warn you -- the jokes don't get any better. They get worse. A lot worse.<br/><br/>But, and this is important -- the game is not a joke. I cannot help being sarcastic and, as an inverterbrate punster, I am spinelessly unable to resist a pun. (See what I mean?) However, this isn't a comedy game -- at least not by design, though you can play it for laughs all you want, and the creatures here, whether they have horrible puns for names or not, are designed to be not just lethal opponents in battle, but to have some feeling of verisimilitude, to be as believable as such strange things can be. To the people living in the world of Earth Delta, these monsters are lurking hazards, potential allies, and deadly mysteries. You, the player, may snicker when you realize what inspired the swarmhound -- but your character will not be laughing as he is covered with vicious, stinging, insects and then ripped to pieces by starving wolves.<br/><br/>As of the first &quot;printing&quot; (well, posting) of this book, Heroic Tier monsters are very complete in terms of number -- more than enough to keep you busy from levels 1-10, especially with the Mutant Bolt On and Instant 'Oids to add variety. Paragon Tier monsters are trickling in, and Epic monsters... would be a really good idea. The creatures here have all been updated statistically to the new &quot;MM3&quot; format, meaning generally higher damage and adjusted attack values, but not all have been reformatted to the new style. Also, just to be clear, as any look through &quot;official&quot; monsters will tell you, the DMG guidelines for monster building are guidelines, not absolutes, to be tweaked up or down as the designer wishes, so all you types that went around adding up the skill points for third party monsters in the D20 Era can just find some other hobby. (Obviously, if someone finds a grossly over/under powered monster, I'd like to know about it, but if Reflex defense is 1 too high or too low, why not assume I did it that way on purpose, and if you don't like it, just change it. Sheesh.)<br/><br/>"}, "98761": {"rpgartist": ["Rick Hershey", "Matt Jordan", "Mongoose Publishing Stockart", "John C.

This is golf as it should be, with lifelike animation patterned after the pros and numerous strategy options.

You know that feeling, and Mean 18 gives it to you again and again.<br/><br/>The decisions that lie before you: Will you stick with your home course or opt for one of the legendary courses - St. Andrews, Pebble Beach? Will you use the pro or regulation tee? Do you want to play expert mode or rely on a caddy to suggest your clubs? Will it be medal or match play? Are you going to hit a bucket of balls or use the practice green before you tee off?<br/><br/>Once you've mastered the Mean 18 courses, you can design your own with The Course Architect. And for those players with the ten all-time best scores, there's a permanent place in the Mean 18 Hall of Fame.<br/><br/>For one to four players. Mean 18 is the most realistic golf simulation ever, right down to the yardage markers showing distance to the pin. But don't let the flowers and scenery fool you.

Feel the smooth, deliberate backswing and compact follow through. But it's up to you to develop a rhythm and avoid that shank or a hook in to the rough.<br/><br/>In addition to the famous courses already provided, you can design your own with the Course Architect.

The object of the game is to keep deadly sparkx from eating away at the cores of twenty different nuclear reactors. If you can&rsquo;t blast the sparkx before they chew up the reactor cores, the result is a MeltDown!<br/><br/>The area surrounding each reactor&rsquo;s core is filled with radioactive matter. Two protons rapidly circle the core. When the two protons intersect, sparkx are released into the reactor. As many as 14 sparkx can be on screen at the same time.

Each time a sparkx hits a control rod, the rod sustains damage. These rods keep the walls of the reactor from collapsing. If the rods are damaged, the reactor walls begin to collapse. If the rods are destroyed the walls collapse completely and the entire reactor suffers a MeltDown. Use the light gun to shoot at the sparkx as they bounce off the borders and control rods. When you destroy a sparkx it will disappear. Be careful! A bad shot from you can damage the control rods. If you place a shot outside the reactor core into the containment wall you will also damage the reactor.<br/><br/>If you shoot and don&rsquo;t hit anything, a barrier will appear. The barrier will function like a wall until it fades away. You can have up to four barriers on screen at a time. The sparkx will rebound off the barriers, so well-placed shots can reflect sparkx away from the control rods. In addition to shooting sparkx and setting up barriers, you can also protect the reactor core by using special protective Power Crystals and bonus blocks found in each reactor. (See Power Crystals and Bonus Blocks.)<br/><br/>After a time the earth will suffer damage from reactor radiation. The damage will result in increased seismic activity. The earthquakes will further damage the control rods. Protected rods suffer less damage from earthquakes.<br/><br/>Save all 20 reactors to win the game.<br/><br/>"}, "98788": {"poll": [], "name": "Midnight Mutants", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US 7800"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic996523.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Horror", "Movie, Book, TV show"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Atari, Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure", "Scrolling"], "videogameplatform": ["Atari 7800"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Atari, Inc."], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic996523_t.jpg", "description": "Midnight Mutants is an action/adventure video game for the Atari 7800 prosystem. The game, along with Sentinel, was one of the last releases by Atari for the Atari 7800.<br/><br/>Midnight Mutants features a broad video game landscape with many locations, a background musical soundtrack, battles against boss creations and an animated introduction.<br/><br/>Premise<br/><br/>Midnight Mutants tells the story of the young boy named Jimmy Harkman, who, on Halloween night in 1992, learns that his grandfather has been turned into a pumpkin by a villain named Doctor Evil. On Halloween night in 1747, Doctor Evil had been burned at the stake as a witch by a Jonathan Harkman, an ancestor of Jimmy's. When Doctor Evil returns from the grave in 1992, he takes out his revenge on Jimmy's grandfather, by transforming Grandpa into a pumpkin.<br/><br/>With his grandfather now taken away from him, Jimmy heads on a Halloween quest to try and find a cure that will return his grandfather to human form. With Doctor Evil on the loose, Jimmy finds the countryside has become inhabited by scary creatures such as zombies and werewolves that can injure him physically and also make his blood impure. Fortunately, even though Grandpa is trapped in pumpkin form, he is available to give Jimmy advice on occasion with the click of a button. Along the way, Jimmy can collect weapons and items that will help him in his quest to defeat evil creatures, giants bosses, and, ultimately Doctor Evil himself.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Midnight Mutants is a scrolling action/adventure game with a horror theme. It is displayed from a pseudo-isometric viewpoint and features a completely free-roaming world design.<br/><br/>In his quest to save Grandpa, Jimmy travels across the country side, exploring an old haunted mansion, a secret laboratory, underground caverns, a haunted forest, a pumpkin patch, a haunted graveyard, an old shipwreck, among other locations.<br/><br/>Initially, Jimmy is powerless to fight the evil that faces him and must rely on his wits and grandpa's advice in order to stay alive. Contact with the creatures roaming about will either cause him physical injury or make his blood lose its purity, both of which will prove fatal if he's not careful. As the game progresses, he locates various weapons of increasing power, health power-ups and other useful items that make it possible to defeat the minions of evil. Key parts of the game culminate in battles against giant boss creatures that take up most of the screen.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Midnight Mutants&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "98789": {"poll": [], "name": "Colomino Card Game", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1464085_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Waddy Production"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1464085.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Waddy First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "52 cards, each card having a number of squares within it.

Also, the R shoulder jump button was replaced with the crawl action, and the jump button is now the x button, meaning the amount of Gadgets the player was allowed to have at once was reduced from 4 to 3. The first unlockable minigame was also changed. The PS1 version was Rocket-ski racing, and you used both analog sticks to control the appropriate ski. In the PSP version, since there is no second analog stick, the skis were changed to snowboards. The tracks were also changed to a Slalom over the original Circle circuit.

The objective is to protect the United States from communist invasion, enemy involvement and terrorist crime. The game is very similar to the Ace Combat series.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>The player takes the role of an air pilot who is part of an elite first strike air unit. This unit is tasked with putting a stop to an international crime organization that is building up a military sized force.<br/><br/>In this air combat game, players can choose to play in a training mode, play a mission mode, or have a VS. battle.<br/><br/>Training mode features 3 different missions with players attempting to get as high of a score as possible. VS. battle has 2 players linking up to play a head-to-head battle against each other.<br/><br/>The main mode is the mission mode. Players can choose from 6 different fighter jets which are the F-4E Phantom II, F-14D Tomcat, F/A-18 Hornet, F-15E Eagle, F-16C Falcon and the F-22 Raptor, each with their own ratings in max speed, endurance, maneuverability, and stability. The game features 12 missions to play through, with objectives such as defending a weapons factory or shooting down a stolen F-16. Each mission completed successfully will reward the player a certain number of credits depending on the difficulty of that mission.<br/><br/>Gameplay involves flying a fighter with a cockpit view. The HUD includes a radar showing the enemy fighters locations plus the number of enemies left. There is also a rear view mirror which lets the player see if there are any enemy fighters on their tail. Players can fire their air-to-air, air-to-surface, and air-to-ground missiles at enemy units.<br/><br/>Options let the player adjust the difficulty level and change the controls between easy or hard.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Bogey Dead 6&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "98843": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1013908.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Nate French", "Eric M.

The first player begins by selecting one of the gifts and &ldquo;opens&rdquo; it by turning it face up. The next player may then select a new gift, or &ldquo;steal&rdquo; an opened gift by taking a face-up Gift Card from a player who has an open gift. When a player steals an open gift they hold it in their hand until a new gift is opened. This way a gift may be stolen only once until a new card is turned over. When a new card is turned over all stolen gift cards are placed face up so the next player may steal any opened gift.<br/><br/>This continues until the last gift is opened. At this point each player keeps the gift they have and a new party begins. This continues until all of the Gift Cards have been played.

The game was also ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993. The NES gamepack has an internal battery to retain game saves; the computer versions came on two disks.<br/><br/>The NES version was among the last titles released for the platform and is relatively rare. The NES version is also noted for having very few sounds or music (mainly just the title theme composed by Jeroen Tel).<br/><br/>The goal of Overlord is to create and protect a network of planetary colonies and defeat a computer adversary who is trying to do the same. There are four skill levels, each represented by an enemy race, and each featuring a progressively stronger opponent. The more advanced a system is, the more freedom a player has when purchasing spacecraft. Higher skill levels also result in different numbers of planets in each system.<br/><br/>The game is controlled using a mouse pointer, and important information is displayed in a message box at the bottom of most screens. Following the introduction screen, the player chooses which planetary system to enter. Planetary systems differ in the number of planets they contain, the types of spacecraft and equipment that can be purchased, and the strength and aggressiveness of the artificial intelligence. The first system contains eight worlds and allows access to only the most basic equipment. The second system has sixteen planets and slightly better equipment. The remaining systems increase in size and strength similarly.<br/><br/>The player and his opponent both begin with control over a single colonized planet in the chosen system. All other planets in between are uninhabited and up for grabs. The player then must set up and maintain thriving colonies on as many planets as possible, and build up an industry and military strong enough to fend off the opponent. Because of the randomness of a system's initial make-up, the order in which planets are colonized has a great subsequent effect upon gameplay.<br/><br/>Before building a colony, planets need to first be terraformed using an atmospheric processor. As a planet's population grows, more taxes can be sent to a player's home starbase. However, in order to survive, colonies need to be supplied with food and energy. The player provides food by buying and placing farming stations on the colony, or by transferring them on starships as cargo. Energy comes from purchasing orbiting solar satellites, but can also be transferred as cargo. Cargo shipments consume fuel, so the player needs to also purchase mining stations. Balancing these and similar factors constitutes the main challenge of the game.<br/><br/>As the player expands his or her empire, he must also create planetary defenses. Defense is achieved by building and maintaining defensive ground armaments on a world. The ability to attack comes from purchasing a battle cruiser and arming it with combinations of both homing and ballistic missiles and hover tanks, then sending the ship to attack an enemy planet's defenses. Planets are taken by eliminating all ground defenses on an enemy world. The only way to win control over a system is to attack and conquer the enemy's starbase in that system. The only way to beat the game is to take the starbase of the last system, Yottsu. Likewise, if the player's home starbase is defeated, the game ends and the player loses.<br/><br/>The NES version game could be considered an early example of real-time strategy, allowing direct control over missile launch, and hover tanks (1 on the map at any given time) on the offensive side, while offering direct control over the plasma cannon defense base and partial control over the pom-pom cannon and lightening field defense bases. The PC version did not have these units, and so could only be remotely considered for this classification.<br/><br/>The NES version is a port of the earlier computer versions. However, there are several differences between them: The NES version uses fewer screens than its PC counterparts, even fewer sounds, and much simplified controls. While the original game uses units of soldiers in platoons which were upgradeable, the NES game condensed the battle elements to missiles and hover tanks against ground defenses, none of which can be upgraded. The message area is much larger in the PC versions, and placed along the right hand side of the screen, compared to bottom center of the NES game. The NES game allows a single saved game to be stored, compared to up to four on the PC games. In the NES version only credits are required to buy craft, whereas the original versions require the player to spend money, minerals, fuel and energy (though this varies depending on the difficulty level). Finally, the use of the docking bays is more complex in the PC games, and the PC versions have a feature where an image of the face of the enemy grows clearer the closer the player is to defeating the game.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Overlord (1990 video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "98893": {"poll": [], "name": "Godzilla: Unleashed", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["French/German Wii edition", "Italian/Spanish PlayStation 2 edition", "North American PlayStation 2 edition", "North American Wii edition"], "average": "6", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogamecharacter": ["Godzilla"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Pipeworks Software"], "videogamefranchise": ["Godzilla"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2", "Wii"], "usersrated": "6", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Atari, Inc."], "vgcharacterversion": ["Godzilla (Unleashed)"], "description": "The game is set during a series of unnatural disasters across Planet Earth due to unexplained appearances of large crystals, where the Vortaak alien race are invading once again.

Then the main part of the turn, the In Play Phase where all characters in the game are activated not by the side upon which they fight but by their Elan Rating. This means better troops and vehicles move and fight before poorer quality troops and vehicles and within each Elan banding from 6 to 1 activation begins with the initiative holding player. When activated each character can choose TWO actions, these include move, ranged fire, melee, hunker down, special action, unique action. The character may choose two different actions OR the same one twice with a modifier; very flexible in battle. Ranged fire and melee are based on opposed single D6 rolls with modifiers for troop type and weapon ratings. This super fast system results in targets being Killed, Struck or Winged by attacks. Killed removes them from play while the other two results negatively effect their further performance in the game.

You are one of the members of this secretive brotherhood of justice. So...are you ready to survive the crime waves in the big city and uncover the infiltrating androids amongst your team that plan a revolt?<br/><br/>Rogue Agent is a tense cyberpunk adventure game that pitches players against underground networks. The game features detailed plastic miniatures, a large variety of unique criminals to defeat, special icon-driven custom dice, and two different game play modes.<br/><br/>In Rogue Agent, players control an agent working for the shady corporation known as &quot;The Agency&quot;, created to control Rain City's crime rate, which has rapidly outpaced the capabilities of the regular police force. Players win the game by obtaining the most power over the city in a race against the game system that creates a living city in which crime and other challenges await at every corner.<br/><br/>Each round consists of an action phase, which is preceded by an upkeep phase. During this action phase, players score power by successfully eliminating assassins, turning in crime bosses, and defusing high-tech bombs that threaten to destroy whole districts. Through investigation of city areas, players gather resources that will be vital for survival. Positioning collaborators in the different locations of the city aids agents in overcoming confrontations with local thugs. Meanwhile, the city police squad is hot on your trail, hoping to contain the illegal side jobs that agents are known for. The Agency, however, has its own air defenses it can call in for support.<br/><br/>Players can scout locations in search for valuable resources that will help them upgrade their abilities, to get more control over the challenges in the game. As the game develops, agents can upgrade their vehicle, weapon and scout abilities as well as gather information about the true identities of other agents. There might be traitors within the Agency. Some of you might be android agents, secretly planning a revolt. Through careful investigation, players can gather intelligence about the true identity of other players. As the game progresses, traitors amongst the agents could be revealed in the form of androids. These agents have access to new victory conditions &ndash; destroying key locations holding information about android production and eliminating human agents &ndash; in a deadly race for control of the city. The first player to reach eight power wins.<br/><br/>Rogue Agent is a fast-playing, easy-to-learn adventure, resource management, and risk management game using fun, streamlined icon-driven custom dice mechanisms. The Living City System creates a dynamic board with characters and challenges in constant motion, creating unique situations with each play and making Rain City come alive on your gaming table.

The Holmes edition of Dungeons & Dragons still has a following of players, despite the fact that it was only released with information covering the first three levels of play.  Since it was intended only as a bridge between Original and Advanced, no other material was provided or planned for this edition.<br/><br/>Over the years fans have created additional material to complete the game, increasing the number of playable levels to higher limits.  This retroclone subsumes both the original game and the fan-made expansions.<br/><br/>Designer's Commentary:<br/><br/>About 6 months ago, after a Holmes gaming spree, i decided to produce a Blue Book Basic clone which would incorporate Meepo's Companion for extending the Blue Book Basic's game play beyond 3rd level. What I loved about Blue Book (and tried to emulate in the clone as well) was the low page count, the short stat blocks and spell description, and the quick-play rules. The 3rd level cap bothered me, but Meepo's Companion took care of that. So, with Meepo's blessing, i set out to produce Wizards, Warriors &amp; Wyrms (the name an homage to the cover illustration).<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>I think WWW is a great little game, and it works for me and my players, but I'd like to know if it would appeal to others as well. The audience I'm targeting with WWW is people who liked the simplicity of Blue Book Basic, the spartan rules that don't complicate game-play, those who love the good doctor's Basic and would have appreciated further game advancement (thanks Meepo!), and those who (like me) think it's really cool to just have a 40 or so page rulebook for unlimited play. Basically, people who loved Blue Book Basic and would have loved for it to be more than just a stepping stone to &quot;advanced&quot; play.<br/><br/>"}, "98993": {"poll": [], "name": "Stranded (2003)", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic996731.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Comedy", "Fishing", "Food / Cooking", "Hunting", "Nature / Jungle", "Ocean / Sea"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Unreal Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic996731_t.jpg", "description": "In the 3D adventure Stranded you assume the role of a cast away, stranded on a desert-island.<br/><br/>Your objective is simple: Survive!
