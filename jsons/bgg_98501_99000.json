Throughout the land various factions vie for power over each other, such as the supposedly noble Order of the Rose or the terrifying Doom Guard. And presiding over the world outside Kilforth is the ever-present Overlord, Masklaw. Over the coming month, a deadly Gloom will descend upon Kilforth,which the Heroes must Battle through to prove their worth, defeat an Ancient evil, and save the land from darkness.<br/> Gloom of Kilforth is a card game of high fantasy with a Gothic edge, playable in 1-3 hours, where 1-4 players, working individually or together, must take their humble adventurers on a journey through a dark world of magic and peril. They will visit strange places, stranger people and overcome powerful enemies in their mission to discover mysterious artefacts and mystical Spells. Players follow their Hero&rsquo;s tale from modest beginnings through an epic story to an exciting climactic battle for the fate of the world. Gloom of Kilforth takes about 45 minutes per player to play.<br/><br/>The following is taken from my design journal:<br/><br/>This game has been in development for a long time and has undergone so many permutations in the last six years that I&rsquo;ve literally ripped it up and started again numerous times.  From board game, to miniatures game, to proto-RPG I&rsquo;ve finally settled on a format I hope will be cost effective and elegant: the card game.<br/> Gloom of Kilforth sees 1-4 players taking a humble adventurer on a journey through a dark world of magic and peril and following their tale from modest beginnings through an epic story to an exciting climactic battle for the fate of the world.<br/> Drawing inspiration from titles we&rsquo;ve already seen like combat-heavy tactical dungeon crawls (Descent, D&amp;D, etc.), condensed overland adventures concerned either with combat (Runebound) or random encounters (Talisman), games that stretch into story-telling (Tales of the Arabian Nights), cooperative games against insurmountable odds (Arkham Horror, Defenders of the Realm), and tactical adventure card games (Lord of the Rings: The Card Game), I&rsquo;ve always been looking to design a game that distils the heroic story telling of an in-depth role playing game down into an amount of time that&rsquo;s playable in an evening.  It&rsquo;s something that many of us crave as we get older and have kids and relationships and jobs and so on which preclude us from throwing all that time away on months of role-playing games.<br/> So whilst I wanted to include all the high fantasy stuff that many of us love, and which in many ways mostly stems from Tolkien&rsquo;s work, I also tried to develop new techniques of weaving them together to create story-based gameplay.<br/> The two key drivers for the game are the Saga Chapters and Night card decks.  The Sagas represent the tales that the heroes will tell as they progress on their journey to fame and fortune, whilst the Night cards are global events that can affect everyone in the Kingdom.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"98233": "First edition"}, "average": "7.90608", "name": "Gloom of Kilforth: A Fantasy Quest Game", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "age": "13", "usersrated": "329", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5496": "Thematic Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "98528": {"rpg": {"10420": "Airship Pirates"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Abney Park's Airship Pirates RPG", "rpghonor": {"20962": "2011 Origins Awards Best Roleplaying Game Nominee"}, "rpgproducer": {"48783": "\"Captain\" Robert Brown"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic989579.jpg", "usersrated": "16", "rpgitemversion": {"98240": "Hardcover"}, "average": "6.3", "rpgissuearticle": {"111497": "Airship Pirates Behind the scenes of an RPG"}, "rpggenre": {"180": "Action / Adventure (Swashbuckling / Pirates)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic989579_t.jpg", "description": "(from the back of the book)<br/><br/>Someone screwed the timeline up<br/><br/>It's 2150.

As such, the Saga Machine core rulebook is necessary to make full use of this work.<br/><br/>By default, the Trystell: Reborn setting makes use of four of the five modules found within the main Saga Machine book: the Combat Module, the Environment Module, the Mental Module and the Social Module.<br/><br/>The only module not in use by default is the Character Design Module. While GMs may still use this module for character creation, if they wish, with no ill effects, it's function has been largely replaced by the Lifepath Module introduced later on in this work.<br/><br/>Specific options for the different core modules in use are detailed below:<br/><br/>Baseline Game: Values given in this book will use the Imperial system of measurement, as for better or worse, that is the most commonly used measurement system where the author of this book resides. In addition, the Trystell setting assumes that the GM is making use of the optional Skill trait, with the default skill list provided in the Saga Machine core rulebook.<br/><br/>Combat Module: This text will assume that the GM has chosen to make use of a hex combat grid, and the optional Bleeding rule.<br/><br/>Mental Module: The Trystell setting makes use of different Power Access traits than the example ones given in the Saga Machine rulebook. Most available Power Access traits use the default power use and power strain rules, but are penalized by encumbrance, and access to their granted powers are restricted by Level. Finally, the GM section of this book should have more information on corruption.<br/><br/>Social Module: By default this book assumes that the campaign is making use of the standard wealth rules, without the option for continuing income. Similarly, this work assumes that the GM is not making use of the optional Recognition trait. Using both of these options is quite reasonable, however, and may be and may be quite suited to a campaign centered around the new Core City (Melanoc), and the outlined campaign presented in the GM's section of this book. Finally, Trystell is considered to generally be a Progress Level 5 world, with an average Control Rating of 2 or 3 (albeit that varies a lot with the region).<br/><br/>"}, "98531": {"rpgitemversion": {"98252": "Softcover version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Assault on Darkspyre", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1002172.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgproducer": {"2249": "Danny O'Neill"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"1788": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)"}, "average": "0", "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"5596": "Building Block Adventures"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1002172_t.jpg", "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>Invade the Tower of an Archmage!<br/><br/>&quot;...and so it stands today, this evil magical fortress.

Conceived of late in 2009 as part an initiative to explore the boundaries of what was possible in the Saga Machine system, Shadows Over Sol is the second setting released for the game, and the first to take Saga Machine into the realm of science fiction and outer space.<br/><br/>Space &amp; Horror<br/>Shadows Over Sol borrows themes and elements from the horror genre, in addition to the science fiction genre, and in many ways space is the perfect setting for horror. Space is alien, isolating and quite hostile to human life. It gets characters outside of their comfort zone, separated from all the usual safety nets that they could normally fall back on in society. This isolation forces characters to take matters of survival into their own hands, even if those hands aren't an expert at the task.<br/><br/>Using space as a set-piece for horror provides a variety of tools and features that can be used to further the mood of horror as the player characters struggle to survive: Communications could be cut off. Life support could begin to fail. Sensors could be damaged. Thrusters could be sabotaged, leaving a ship a long, long voyage home. Unexpected things could happen while a character is in hibernation. And, of course, there could be things out there.<br/><br/>Player Characters<br/>Shadows Over Sol is a setting filled with many competing interests, shadowy organizations and secret conspiracies. All of these groups have the need for small bands of agents to covertly do their dirty work, any one of these groups might hire the player characters. Out there in space a thousand things could be happening, all unknown to the population back home &mdash; a population that wants to stay fed and comfortable in its ignorance.<br/><br/>Shadows Over Sol by default assumes that player characters are members of one of these freelance teams, working for different organizations. This gives the game master a structure to build sessions around&mdash;missions on behalf of one of these entities &mdash; and player characters the agency in deciding which missions to take and which organizations they feel comfortable working for. Naturally, however, more dangerous missions come with greater rewards. But even the more innocuous-seeming mission could have unforeseen deadly twists lurking in the darkness of space.<br/><br/>"}, "98533": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1003705.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"428": {"name": "Dan Verssen"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2008", "maxplayers": "12", "age": "12", "boardgamepublisher": {"3683": {"name": "Dan Verssen Games (DVG)"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1003705_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"2650": {"name": "Aviation / Flight"}}, "description": "The card decks contained in the Down In Flames - Aces High game will accommodate up to 6 players.

Magic, action, danger, combat, treasure, heroes, villains, gold and fame can all be found there. Elements of fantasy such as gnomes, dwarves, elves, minotaur and orcs can be found as well. Yet, in many ways Trystell is a world like our own. Plants, animals, greed, prejudice, honor, humor and deceit can be found within its bounds. Trystell is a setting ideally suited for heroic drama. It is a place where hopes, dreams, fears and ambitions await the eager adventurer. Good battles evil. Heroic adventurers fight sinister villains in epic battles, although sometimes things are a little more gray and the lines between hero an villain become blurred. Good luck in your journey into the fascinating world of Trystell.<br/><br/>How Trystell Differs From Other d20 Games<br/>Trystell has a number of unique elements that distinguish it from other fantasy d20 games. Not only does the world has its own unique flavor, it has a blend of high fantasy, impossible technology and more advanced academic theorems.<br/><br/>In addition to mere setting differences, Trystell also has a number of different variations from the standard d20 game mechanics. The following list is by no means complete, however, it should offer an overview of the most important mechanic chances for the experienced d20 player.<br/><br/>     The Trystell setting offers a number of new races, classes and feats. In addition, the Trystell settings overhauls several existing classes.<br/>     The Trystell game utilizes a system of determining the contacts and allies of player characters, their reputations in the game world and a system of increasing unarmed AC as a character gains levels.<br/>     Characters in the Trystell setting have Vitality and Wound points instead of Hit Points. This provides a more realistic and gritty feel to combat.<br/>     The Trystell game utilizes character options called Traits and Flaws. Traits are packages taken at character creation that helps define a characters&rsquo; strengths and weaknesses; flaws are kind of like anti-feats that grant characters bonus feats for taking a weakness.<br/>     The Trystell setting uses a different system for determining magic. Instead of having set spell slots, a spellcaster has a pool of spell points from which she casts spells.<br/>     Player characters in the Trystell setting have a mechanic resource known as Action Points.<br/>     There are no true alignments on Trystell. Instead characters have a trait called Allegiance.<br/>     Armor on Trystell provides not just a bonus to AC, but a bonus to defense as well.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "98535": {"rpgitemversion": {"188564": "PDF version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Terror at Camp Waka'Naka", "rpgproducer": {"22813": "Leighton Connor"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1478562.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"158": "Horror"}, "rpg": {"2640": "QAGS (Quick Ass Game System)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1478562_t.png", "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>Almost two hundred years ago George Washington wrote about the land that would become Camp Waka'Naka. &quot;The wildlife is abundant, the climate pleasing, and the river tranquil and soothing.&quot; Washington didn't anticipate the deranged psychopath now on the loose.

If you cannot afford to banish the monster you lose.<br/><br/>Defending is done by building towers and creating gems which cost increasing amounts of mana.  Gems come in 8 colors each doing damage and a secondary effect to the monsters it strikes.  Secondary effects include Mana gain, poison, stun, slowing, and several others.  Gems can be combined to create higher rank gems which deal more damage.  Gems can also be thrown as bombs to do area of effect damage.<br/><br/>After each level is completed experience is awarded which allows the player to learn skills.  Skills were able to make gems and towers cost less mana, making gems more powerful, or granting starting gems.

Whereas a feat enables a character to be better than normal at performing a task (or even to do something that normal characters can't), a flaw restricts a character's capabilities or imposes a penalty of some sort.<br/><br/>Postmodern Traits and Flaws 2 includes:<br/><br/>     Five categories of traits and flaws; mundane, conspiracy, occult, psionic and supernatural.<br/>     Thirteen new character traits.<br/>     Ten new flaws.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Note: The original [Traits and Flaws] may be required to utilize these new traits and flaws fully.<br/><br/>"}, "98568": {"rpgitemversion": {"98327": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Postmodern: Iconic Combat Feats", "rpgproducer": {"17618": "Michael Todd"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"305": "d20 Modern"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"10433": "OGL Postmodern"}, "rpggenre": {"940": "Action / Adventure"}, "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Have more fun in combat-- with this pdf of 129 feats for your Modern d20 game!<br/><br/>Postmodern: Iconic Combat Feats expands on the core combat feats from the d20 Modern roleplaying game-- building on such favorites as Power Attack, Point Blank Shot, Bull Rush, Combat Expertise, and so on-- to present 108 dynamic new feats guaranteed to give new life to Modern games by taking the tactics and abilities of the feats you know and creating a whole family of complimentary feats for each one.

It dates back to the very beginnings of Tab Creations, back to 1993, when Tab Creations' focus was still primarily on comics and not on role-playing games.<br/><br/>In those early days the setting began with a handful of superheroes created by the various members of the Collective , and then a variety of supervillains were created to combat them. From there the setting began to grow, remaining Tab Creations' biggest focus until 1998, when work began on the Swords &amp; Arrows Role-Playing Game and the Trystell fantasy setting. Even then it was intended that the Zeotis would get its own roleplaying game using the same system. Plans were drawn up, yet they never came to fruition, and the Zeotis slowly fell by the wayside. Until now!<br/><br/>Since those early days the Zeotis setting has undergone at least two major revisions, as well as major expansions and oversight to add some degree of continuity and internal consistency to the setting &mdash;although it is a supers setting, and in the supers genre, bold characters and larger-than-life personalities loom larger than mere setting verisimilitude.<br/><br/>So here it is. Welcome to the first official release of the the Zeotis setting in a role-playing game format. Designed for use with our Saga Machine rules system, this booklet &mdash; along with the Saga Machine core rulebook &mdash; should contain everything you need to write and run your own campaign set in the Zeotis universe.<br/><br/>So go find some players, come up with some colorful concepts and get your game stared. We hope you enjoy the ride.<br/><br/><br/>Themes &amp; Assumptions<br/><br/>There is something of a paradox at the core of any supers role-playing game setting: Supers settings by long-standing tradition focus first and foremost on the lives, powers and personalities of their star characters. In any individual title, the themes and personalities of that title take precedent over any continuity and themes for the supers world as a whole. And in a supers game, that's perhaps as it should be.<br/><br/>Because of that, supers role-playing settings benefit from being somewhat &ldquo;generic,&rdquo; so as to allow player characters and their personal themes to easily assume that title role and limelight in the setting. It should be noted then that while this booklet details a number of cannon elements to the Zeotis setting, and a number of signature characters, they are meant to be used as background by the GM. While it might be interesting to have one of the cannon superheroes guest star for the session &mdash; or even be a sympathetic antagonistic for a session &mdash; these signature characters should not overshadow the player characters of the campaign, and at the end of the day, should retire back to somewhere in the background.<br/><br/>All things being equal, though, the Zeotis setting was written to have some underlying sets of assumptions to it. There are a wide range of supers stories out there, and the basic themes and assumptions of supers universes has changed many times over their long history.<br/><br/>That said, the Zeotis setting has something of a &quot;Bronze Age&quot; feel to it. Heroes are larger than life, although not as absurdly powerful as the heroes of the &quot;Silver Age.&quot; Darker social issues and circumstances are not shied away from, yet heroes are generally still recognizably heroes&mdash;with their bright costumes and their altruistic agendas &mdash; not really the brooding anti-heroes of the &quot;Iron Age.&quot;<br/><br/>If these terms for the different eras of supers confuse you, don't worry. They get described in detail later in this booklet.<br/><br/><br/>Modules<br/><br/>Naturally, this booklet is meant for use with the Saga Machine role-playing system. And as a Saga Machine product, a variety of optional modules are used to create the feel of a supers setting. Which modules and options are in use are detailed below.<br/><br/>     Supers Module: A new module presented in this booklet, the Super Module details a variety of new rules meant to emulate the supers genre, as well as tweaking the options used by the other modules.<br/>     Character Design Module: The Character Design Module is fully in use for the Zeotis setting, albeit with a number of new options presented by the Supers Module. Of note are the various supers arrays for generating stats, and the bid system for super power limitations.<br/>     Combat Module: The combat module is, of course, in use, as spectacular combats are a staple of the genre. Of the Combat Module options, both the Hit Points variant and abstract movement are turned on.<br/>     Environment Module: The Environment Module presented in the Saga Machine core rulebook is not used. It is largely replaced by the Supers Module.<br/>     Mental Module: The Mental Module is in use, although a new variant on the usual Focus and Composure Track in in use, and presented as part of the Super Module.<br/>     Social Module: While the Abstract Wealth system is poached by the Supers Module, the Social Module is not otherwise in use with the Zeotis setting.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "98577": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Casus Belli (Issue 17 - Oct 1983)", "rpgproducer": {"4574": "Didier Guiserix"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic989901.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"9611": "Casus Belli"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"141992": "Ace of Aces"}, "rpg": {"191": "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (1st Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"98343": "First edition"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic989901_t.png", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>In this issue:<br/><br/>* Nouvelles du Front<br/> * Prague, review of GDW's The Battle of Prague<br/> * War &amp; Peace, review of Avalon Hill's War and Peace<br/> * Amiraut&eacute;, introduction to Amiraut\u00e9<br/> * Squad Leader, analysis of the cavalry rules in SL, and a scenario<br/> * Ace of Aces, follow-up of the previous issue's article about Ace of Aces<br/> * La Bataille de Garigliano, rules, board and counters for the included game La Bataille du Garigliano<br/> * Devine qui vient diner ce soir, new monsters for AD&amp;D, and new magical items<br/> * Les Combats dans Runequest, analysis of Runequest's combat rules<br/> * Call of Cthulhu, review of Call of Cthulhu (1st Edition)<br/> * Nocturne pour Violon, scenario for Call of Cthulhu<br/> * Le Jardin d'Olphara, AD&amp;D module for a party of six 5-7th level characters<br/> * Ludotique, reviews of the video games Galactic Gladiators, Galactic Adventure and Death in the Caribbean<br/><br/>"}, "98578": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Sea Wolf / Bombardier", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"204926": "North American Astrocade (Astrocade Inc.) edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic994847.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2508": "Military"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2505": "Shoot 'em Up"}, "videogameplatform": {"10097": "Bally Professional Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic994847_t.jpg", "description": "Game Manual<br/><br/>Sea Wolf is a one or two player game.<br/><br/>The object of Sea Wolf is to score as many points as you can by sinking both the blue and yellow ships which cross your television screen.

If he has two or fewer cards in hand, he can play one card or end his turn. If he has 3-5 cards, he must either play a card, discard a card, or discard a block from his collection. If he has six cards, he must play a card.<br/><br/>The first player to assemble a 333 cube with no extra blocks and no protrustions or holes in the structure wins the round. The first player to win two rounds wins the game. If you assemble a 333 cube from nine blocks or in a single color, then you win the game instantly.<br/><br/>"}, "98655": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Cruise for a Corpse", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"98540": "UK/FR/DE MS-DOS Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic999649.png", "videogametheme": {"2280": "Crime"}, "usersrated": "2", "average": "7.5", "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4415": "Amiga"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic999649_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>The game plays during 1927 which features smooth animated characters on a hand drawn background.<br/><br/>Being invited on a trip on a cruise liner the player gets confronted with a murder.

The Kingdom in Exile is not a defeat in the sense that it does not spell the end of the Kingdom.

It is meant to be used with your favorite table top roleplaying game system. Admittedly some games will support the Rocketship Empires setting with less fuss than others. In particular, games written for the science fiction genre which already include a starship combat system and a means for handling psionics and alien technology will require less work on the part of the game director and players.<br/><br/>With that in mind, everything presented in the Rocketship Empires books is meant for use in a table top roleplaying game and not in a war game. This is to say that the ideas presented for starship construction are merely an aid for directors whose table top rules do not include a starship combat and starship building system which can be easily tweaked into the WWII pulp style starfighters and ships featured in RE.<br/><br/>If your rules already include a starship combat system and ship construction guide, simply review what is presented here and dump the unnecessary structure so you can convert the ships into the system you intend to use.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that in a roleplaying game the structure should serve the fun of the game and not restrict it. When I create starships (like those featured here) I start with the ship construction guide in the back of the core book and then I go wild, writing in broad strokes to achieve the ship I wish to create. I usually base the ships on a historical craft but not always.

The thirty-six known effect Runes and three control Runes have been used in countless skirmishes, and continue to power Rune Stryders to this day. For most, these known Runes have always been sufficient for any magical need.<br/><br/>But not everyone is satisfied with the accumulated knowledge. Rune hunters scour the planet, searching for the one new Rune that could give them incredible power or unimaginable wealth. For those who seek to dominate their fellow men, or who simply seek a life of excess, the promise of undiscovered Runes is a powerful lure.<br/><br/>Using This Book<br/>This book is divided into four sections. The first section is entitled New Runes, and details just that - six new effect Runes and two new control Runes, complete with spell descriptions. The second section, Advanced Runewords, expands upon the Runeword possibilities in the core book by presenting a larger group of advanced Runewords for your exceptionally skilled Runecasters. The third section, Runic Artifacts, provides a variety of Runed items to challenge or reward your players. The final chapter, Finding Runes, provides the gamemaster with several new ideas for working these Runes into a campaign, as well as a few adventures.<br/><br/>"}, "98692": {"statistics": {}, "name": "No Quarter (Issue 20 - Sep 2008)", "rpgproducer": {"21911": "Christopher Bodan"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic991163.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "rpgissue": {"4620": "No Quarter"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"45385": "All Roads Lead to Legends"}, "rpg": {"524": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"98601": "Magazine"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic991163_t.jpg", "description": "From Publisher Website:<br/><br/>No Quarter #20 contains more HORDES: Metamorphosis previews, bonejacks in Guts &amp; Gears and the Combat Alchemist in the Iron Kingdoms.<br/><br/>Cover Art &quot;Nightmare from WARMACHINE: Legends&quot; by Andrea Uderzo<br/><br/>ISSN: 7558200361<br/><br/>"}, "98693": {"statistics": {}, "name": "No Quarter (Issue 21 - Nov 2008)", "rpgproducer": {"21911": "Christopher Bodan"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic991166.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "rpgissue": {"4620": "No Quarter"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"45654": "2008 Formula P3 Grandmaster Painting Competition"}, "rpg": {"524": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"98603": "Magazine"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic991166_t.jpg", "description": "From Publisher Website:<br/><br/>No Quarter #21 showcases the winners of the 2008 Forumula P3 Grandmaster Painting Competition and the winners of the Masters and Hardcore Championships.

This measurement should be taken on the inside of the track.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;When the horse has reached the distance post (two movement areas before the Winning Post) no horse is allowed to cross directly in front of another horse. If a horse crosses another in this fashion and within this area and subsequently finishes first, second, or third, the jockey on the crossed horse may lodge an objection, which will be automatically sustained. The offending horse is then placed last and the other horses naturally move up to fill the vacant place.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Once round the track will be a Five Furlong Sprint race.

It is 1025, and the emperor Basileios II has ascended into the heavens without providing for an heir. In Constantinople, representatives from the most important aristocratic families vie for their favored to inherit the Emperor's ring and throne.<br/><br/>It is a futile and petty dispute as each family is not about to surrender the throne to any of the others, but they ultimately decide that the winner will be the one who's supported by most of the wealthiest cities of the empire. Every ambitious successor raises the banner of  his dynasty and begins the struggle to win over the cities that will secure him the throne.<br/><br/>Each family secretly chooses seven imperial cities that they will seek to control through the actions available to them: Commandment, Diplomacy, Exile, Trade, Garrison, Espionage, and Corruption. May the rightful heir arise!<br/><br/><br/>Nekken is a fantasy-themed implementation of this game using the exact same materials as Byzantio and with a map on the reverse side of the game board, giving a different game experience and essentially two games in one.<br/><br/>Four tribes have been living in peace for over 3000 years despite the ancient hatred of each other. United in the capital city Nekken, they slowly forgot their fear of the large volcano that looms over the metropolis &ndash; until the volcano erupted. Forced to abandon their homes, the tribes spread throughout the continent, facing danger in many forms while trying to establish new colonies. Their ancient hatred has also been awakened and now they must struggle to survive. However, they still need each other, a new cold war emerges in the shadow of the searing heat of the volcano.<br/><br/>In Nekken, each player takes the role of a leader of their tribe and tries to be the one who will prevail and become the ruler of this new society. The goal is to achieve prestige through the establishment of new and glorious cities, using actions to move their leader on the map, exploring, establishing cities, betraying friends to achieve their objective.

It is inspired by classic &quot;post apocalyptic&quot; role playing games, most especially older edition of Gamma World and Metamorphosis Alpha, but also draws considerably from films like &quot;Wizards&quot;, comic books like &quot;Kamandi&quot;, and 1980s cartoons like &quot;Thundarr, The Barbarian&quot;. It is a game set in a world ravaged by war and now utterly transformed, a world where beasts walk on two legs and plot against humans, where plantmen walk side-by-side with robotic war machines, where even ordinary men and women can perform feats of extraordinary power. In this setting, you may face foes armed with everything from stone knives to high-tech death rays, you may battle simple bandits or gargantuan, lightning-breathing mutant crocodiles, you may explore ruined cities which reach across the horizon or slog through dense jungles. You may even look down on the ruined Earth from an orbital city, or find a sub-sea civilization still secure within its dome of synthetic diamond a foot thick.<br/><br/>While it draws stylistic inspiration from much older games, it uses rules from modern games... specifically, it is built on the rules for the Fourth Edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and this document assumes both possession of and familiarity with those rules, which are essential for play.<br/><br/>Earth Delta is designed to allow play in a variety of styles, from all-out gonzo to relatively serious. The nature of the rules system and the design choices mean that, regardless of style or tone, there will be a general focus on action, conflict, daring deeds, and dismal (but possibly hilarious) failures. It is possible to play campaign where a mutant rosebush shares genes with a spider and her allies are a rabbit obsessed with ancient science and a vicious robot nanny intent on &quot;disciplining&quot; any &quot;naughty&quot; enemies with a built-in sledgehammer, or you may have a campaign featuring only &quot;normal&quot; humans, struggling to survive and possibly rebuild the world. Earth Delta provides the rules; you decide how to apply them, how serious or silly you want to be.<br/><br/>This book contains the core rules, intended for players and DMs.<br/><br/><br/>DESIGN GOALS<br/><br/>Here are the goals I set forth when I began this project in February 2010, having no idea just how long it would take to get to the Beta state. These goals have not changed, and I believe Earth Delta meets them all, to varying degrees of completeness. The goals of Earth Delta are:<br/><br/>     Capture the spirit of old-style Gamma World, especially the first and second editions, and of the sources which inspired it or which seemed to draw inspiration from it: Hiero's Journey, Heinlein's Orphans Of The Sky, Metamorphosis Alpha, Kamandi, Thundarr, Wasteland, Fallout, and anything else with mutants and mayhem.<br/>     Create a game which is balanced and playable. This isn't a beer-and-pretzels game (though it can be) or one where you create &quot;wacky&quot; throwaway characters. Nor is it one where random luck determines if you're useful. One of the Unchanged is just as powerful as a winged grizzly bear with laser eyes.<br/>     Allow for the playing of winged grizzly bears with laser eyes.<br/>     Be balanced with standard 4e rules, so there's minimal work involved in taking creatures, or characters, from this game into D&amp;D.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Mad? They dared to call me mad? Well, we'll see how it goes.<br/><br/>BETA 1<br/>What you are holding in your hand... or, more probably, looking at on your screen... is the &quot;Beta&quot; version of the rules for Earth Delta. What this means is that the core mechanics are very unlikely to change. There has been some playtesting, and it's been determined things work well enough as a framework. What may change -- what almost certainly will change -- is small details, if an ability gives a +1 or a +2, if a power belongs in the third level or the seventh, if it should stun or daze, and so on.<br/><br/>This document focuses very heavily on the first ten levels of play, the &quot;Heroic Tier&quot;. There is quite a bit of material which goes beyond that, especially in the form of higher-level mutations and technological items, but the Earth Delta is really only &quot;complete&quot; to level 10... there are very few monsters, class powers, paragon paths, and so on beyond this level. As the Beta becomes more solid, more higher-level material will be added, and of course players and DMs are free to make their own... and send it to me, if they wish, for possible inclusion.<br/><br/>"}, "98755": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Red Giant (Volume 1, Number 2 - 1990)", "rpgproducer": {"1093": "Ian Bailey"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic690080.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "6", "rpgissue": {"4782": "Red Giant"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"45412": "Boo!

Similar in style to Operation Wolf, Alien Brigade tells the story of a soldier that is forced to do battle with aliens that are invading the planet and taking over the bodies of fellow soldiers in the process. One of the last releases for the Atari 7800, Alien Brigade is a sought after title due to its relative scarcity, above-average graphics and Nintendo-like gameplay.<br/><br/>Alien Brigade is 144K in size, making it one of the largest commercially released Atari 7800 games.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Like Operation Wolf, the game is played from the point of view of the soldier. The game scrolls horizontally in two directions as various enemy creatures, possessed soldiers, human vehicles and alien vehicles attack mercilessly. Alien Brigade can either be played with the Atari 7800 joystick or with an Atari light gun.<br/><br/>The game takes place over five scrolling levels. The initial mission is to rescue hostages from an enemy camp, but the game then progresses to a waterfront battle, an underwater melee, a showdown in an underground mine, and then a final mountaintop battle. Adding to the challenge, the player is must be careful not to accidentally shoot innocent bystanders.<br/><br/>Between levels, the player is briefed by the commanding officer, who advises of the situation and rates the player's performance in the level.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Alien Brigade&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>Game Manual<br/><br/>Aliens Brainwash Humans<br/><br/>Some of the guys in the barracks have been acting a little odd lately. You were assigned to a special task force investigating the soldiers' strange, almost alien behavior.<br/><br/>The investigation revealed the astounding fact that aliens from another dimension have invaded the Earth. The aliens have brainwashed soldiers into M-16 toting zombies who will instantly obey their alien masters. (Sort of like boot camp.)<br/><br/>Worse yet, some aliens have actually taken over the bodies of soldiers and civilians. Every day more humans are being mysteriously possessed or brainwashed.<br/><br/>You also discovered that the aliens possess a deadly secret weapon. If the aliens are not stopped, this weapon will brainswash the entire human population of Earth! Ok, so you realize that in most people the difference would go unnoticed; still, it is your job to try to save the people of Earth. Your task force must seek out all the alien fiends, destroy them, and save the Earth.<br/><br/>Think you can handle it?

Bah-dum-bum! (You liberals can substitute &quot;than the compensation for a Wall Street fat cat that leeches off the backs of the Workers&quot;). So, I've decided to split the book in twain, or possibly in clemens, and if you're just wandering in here from some other PDF and have no idea what to expect, let me warn you -- the jokes don't get any better. They get worse. A lot worse.<br/><br/>But, and this is important -- the game is not a joke. I cannot help being sarcastic and, as an inverterbrate punster, I am spinelessly unable to resist a pun. (See what I mean?) However, this isn't a comedy game -- at least not by design, though you can play it for laughs all you want, and the creatures here, whether they have horrible puns for names or not, are designed to be not just lethal opponents in battle, but to have some feeling of verisimilitude, to be as believable as such strange things can be. To the people living in the world of Earth Delta, these monsters are lurking hazards, potential allies, and deadly mysteries. You, the player, may snicker when you realize what inspired the swarmhound -- but your character will not be laughing as he is covered with vicious, stinging, insects and then ripped to pieces by starving wolves.<br/><br/>As of the first &quot;printing&quot; (well, posting) of this book, Heroic Tier monsters are very complete in terms of number -- more than enough to keep you busy from levels 1-10, especially with the Mutant Bolt On and Instant 'Oids to add variety. Paragon Tier monsters are trickling in, and Epic monsters... would be a really good idea. The creatures here have all been updated statistically to the new &quot;MM3&quot; format, meaning generally higher damage and adjusted attack values, but not all have been reformatted to the new style. Also, just to be clear, as any look through &quot;official&quot; monsters will tell you, the DMG guidelines for monster building are guidelines, not absolutes, to be tweaked up or down as the designer wishes, so all you types that went around adding up the skill points for third party monsters in the D20 Era can just find some other hobby. (Obviously, if someone finds a grossly over/under powered monster, I'd like to know about it, but if Reflex defense is 1 too high or too low, why not assume I did it that way on purpose, and if you don't like it, just change it.

A gang of international terrorists has systematically set about destroying the world. They have sabotaged a number of nuclear reactors by unleashing a deadly string of &lsquo;sparkx&rsquo; that will break down the protective control rods and make their way into the very core of each reactor. If the sparkx reach the core, the end result will be a dreaded MeltDown. It the terrorists are successful in their hideous plot, we can kiss this world goodbye!<br/><br/>Only you stand between life as we know it and total annihilation. You are armed with a specially engineered sparkx-destroying gun, a blueprint of each reactor, your wits, and your desire to save the world. Get moving. There&rsquo;s no time to lose!<br/><br/>Playing the Game<br/><br/>MeltDown is a fast-action arcade game. The object of the game is to keep deadly sparkx from eating away at the cores of twenty different nuclear reactors. If you can&rsquo;t blast the sparkx before they chew up the reactor cores, the result is a MeltDown!<br/><br/>The area surrounding each reactor&rsquo;s core is filled with radioactive matter. Two protons rapidly circle the core. When the two protons intersect, sparkx are released into the reactor. As many as 14 sparkx can be on screen at the same time. You must shoot the sparkx quickly before they can damage the reactor core.<br/><br/>Inside the core of each reactor are eight or nine blue control rods arranged in various geometric patterns. Each time a sparkx hits a control rod, the rod sustains damage. These rods keep the walls of the reactor from collapsing. If the rods are damaged, the reactor walls begin to collapse. If the rods are destroyed the walls collapse completely and the entire reactor suffers a MeltDown. Use the light gun to shoot at the sparkx as they bounce off the borders and control rods. When you destroy a sparkx it will disappear. Be careful! A bad shot from you can damage the control rods. If you place a shot outside the reactor core into the containment wall you will also damage the reactor.<br/><br/>If you shoot and don&rsquo;t hit anything, a barrier will appear. The barrier will function like a wall until it fades away. You can have up to four barriers on screen at a time. The sparkx will rebound off the barriers, so well-placed shots can reflect sparkx away from the control rods. In addition to shooting sparkx and setting up barriers, you can also protect the reactor core by using special protective Power Crystals and bonus blocks found in each reactor. (See Power Crystals and Bonus Blocks.)<br/><br/>After a time the earth will suffer damage from reactor radiation. The damage will result in increased seismic activity. The earthquakes will further damage the control rods. Protected rods suffer less damage from earthquakes.<br/><br/>Save all 20 reactors to win the game.<br/><br/>"}, "98788": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Midnight Mutants", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"98779": "US 7800"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic996523.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2265": "Horror"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2161": "Action Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4418": "Atari 7800"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic996523_t.jpg", "description": "Midnight Mutants is an action/adventure video game for the Atari 7800 prosystem. The game, along with Sentinel, was one of the last releases by Atari for the Atari 7800.<br/><br/>Midnight Mutants features a broad video game landscape with many locations, a background musical soundtrack, battles against boss creations and an animated introduction.<br/><br/>Premise<br/><br/>Midnight Mutants tells the story of the young boy named Jimmy Harkman, who, on Halloween night in 1992, learns that his grandfather has been turned into a pumpkin by a villain named Doctor Evil. On Halloween night in 1747, Doctor Evil had been burned at the stake as a witch by a Jonathan Harkman, an ancestor of Jimmy's. When Doctor Evil returns from the grave in 1992, he takes out his revenge on Jimmy's grandfather, by transforming Grandpa into a pumpkin.<br/><br/>With his grandfather now taken away from him, Jimmy heads on a Halloween quest to try and find a cure that will return his grandfather to human form. With Doctor Evil on the loose, Jimmy finds the countryside has become inhabited by scary creatures such as zombies and werewolves that can injure him physically and also make his blood impure. Fortunately, even though Grandpa is trapped in pumpkin form, he is available to give Jimmy advice on occasion with the click of a button. Along the way, Jimmy can collect weapons and items that will help him in his quest to defeat evil creatures, giants bosses, and, ultimately Doctor Evil himself.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Midnight Mutants is a scrolling action/adventure game with a horror theme. It is displayed from a pseudo-isometric viewpoint and features a completely free-roaming world design.<br/><br/>In his quest to save Grandpa, Jimmy travels across the country side, exploring an old haunted mansion, a secret laboratory, underground caverns, a haunted forest, a pumpkin patch, a haunted graveyard, an old shipwreck, among other locations.<br/><br/>Initially, Jimmy is powerless to fight the evil that faces him and must rely on his wits and grandpa's advice in order to stay alive. Contact with the creatures roaming about will either cause him physical injury or make his blood lose its purity, both of which will prove fatal if he's not careful. As the game progresses, he locates various weapons of increasing power, health power-ups and other useful items that make it possible to defeat the minions of evil.

(The diet soft drink was because Louie was watching his weight--nobody likes a fat junkyard guy.) The phone rang and Louie picked it up, even though his mouth was full. He listened a few moments, and then sprayed crumbs of bread and head cheese all over the office. A dastardly dognapper gang kidnapped his best pal Scraps, the infamous Scrapyard Dog! If Louie doesn't hand over the deed to the junkyard, Scraps is dog-gone!<br/><br/>Louie played along, and told the kidnappers he would bring the deed to the first checkpoint to receive further instructions. But it's unAmerican to knuckle under to kidnappers and terrorists, and Louie won't do it!

The kidnappers leave instructions for Louie at each of sixteen checkpoints. Louie has a specific period of time to reach each checkpoint. Along the way he must dodge rats and other annoying obstacles like rolling tires. Louie must also collect as many weapons and other useful items as possible.

The objective is to protect the United States from communist invasion, enemy involvement and terrorist crime. The game is very similar to the Ace Combat series.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>The player takes the role of an air pilot who is part of an elite first strike air unit. This unit is tasked with putting a stop to an international crime organization that is building up a military sized force.<br/><br/>In this air combat game, players can choose to play in a training mode, play a mission mode, or have a VS. battle.<br/><br/>Training mode features 3 different missions with players attempting to get as high of a score as possible. VS. battle has 2 players linking up to play a head-to-head battle against each other.<br/><br/>The main mode is the mission mode. Players can choose from 6 different fighter jets which are the F-4E Phantom II, F-14D Tomcat, F/A-18 Hornet, F-15E Eagle, F-16C Falcon and the F-22 Raptor, each with their own ratings in max speed, endurance, maneuverability, and stability. The game features 12 missions to play through, with objectives such as defending a weapons factory or shooting down a stolen F-16. Each mission completed successfully will reward the player a certain number of credits depending on the difficulty of that mission.<br/><br/>Gameplay involves flying a fighter with a cockpit view. The HUD includes a radar showing the enemy fighters locations plus the number of enemies left. There is also a rear view mirror which lets the player see if there are any enemy fighters on their tail. Players can fire their air-to-air, air-to-surface, and air-to-ground missiles at enemy units.<br/><br/>Options let the player adjust the difficulty level and change the controls between easy or hard.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Bogey Dead 6&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "98843": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1013908.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"11655": {"name": "Nate French"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamepublisher": {"2973": {"name": "Edge Entertainment"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1013908_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Fantasy Flight Games is pleased to announce the next exciting Chapter Pack for A Game of Thrones: The Card Game, Forging the Chain!

The first player begins by selecting one of the gifts and &ldquo;opens&rdquo; it by turning it face up. The next player may then select a new gift, or &ldquo;steal&rdquo; an opened gift by taking a face-up Gift Card from a player who has an open gift. When a player steals an open gift they hold it in their hand until a new gift is opened. This way a gift may be stolen only once until a new card is turned over. When a new card is turned over all stolen gift cards are placed face up so the next player may steal any opened gift.<br/><br/>This continues until the last gift is opened. At this point each player keeps the gift they have and a new party begins. This continues until all of the Gift Cards have been played.

In this single player side-scrolling game, you control Pan through several levels, each based on the television series of the same name, battling pirates and avoiding various traps until you reach the pirate ship for your battle with the evil Captain Hook.<br/><br/>Each level has a certain number of pirates and other enemies that must be defeated before Pan can advance to the next level. Sometimes Wendy or others members of the Lost Boys will appear to offer you helpful bits of advice. Beyond that, Pan can collect fairy dust to fly, as well as treasure chests and Tinker Bell to restore lost health.<br/><br/>Sometimes you can collect red balls to throw at enemies, but for the most part your primary weapon in the game is a short sword with a limited attack range.  The game has no continues or passwords, but you can earn extra lives during bonus levels.<br/><br/>* Level 1: Forest<br/>    * Level 2: Green Cave<br/>    * Level 3: Forest<br/>    * Level 4: Blue Cave<br/>    * Level 5: Blue Forest<br/>    * Level 6: Red Cave<br/>    * Level 7: Pirate Ship<br/><br/>Many of the levels are actually repeats with slightly different colors being used, and at the end of each level you will see Captain Hook running back and forth, except in the final level where you have to get Hook to walk the plank.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Peter Pan and the Pirates (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "98889": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Mad Max", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"99001": "North American NES edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1125717.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4430": "NES"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1125717_t.jpg", "description": "Mad Max is a NES game that is based on the film Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior.<br/><br/>The object is to survive life after the end of the world by battling survivalists and collecting valuable food, water, gasoline, and money in order to continue racing into the desert wasteland that lies beyond.<br/><br/>The player begins the game in Max's Pursuit Special (his famous car featured in the movie series). As the player drives through the non-linear stage (referred to as a Road War), they encounter enemy vehicles, roadblocks, and dynamite-hurling bunkers. The player is given a very limited supply of dynamite to be used on these threats by throwing it directly at them. In each level, a small, run-down service station can be found, offering goods such as fuel and dynamite, as well as auto repair services in exchange for food and water.<br/><br/>Scattered throughout the levels are abandoned mines, marked by a small shed. By driving into the shed, Max will leave his vehicle and enter the mine. While inside the mine, Max may explore the area in a pseudo-3D environment. Food, water, fuel, and ammunition may be found inside the mines. Enemy survivalists are also present inside the mine, and will protect the items found within, however Max is armed with a shotgun, which also has limited ammo. Additional ammo may be found inside the mine.<br/><br/>The main goal of each level is to enter the arena and battle the enemy gangs. The player must gather enough food and water to trade at the service station for an Arena Pass. Once the pass is obtained, the player must find the Arena, which appears as a large cave. Once inside the arena, the player must be the last vehicle to survive the demolition derby inside. Enemy vehicles drive around the arena and attempt to push the player, as well as each other, off of the road into the abyss below. In addition, several areas of the floor open up at random, leaving vehicles to fall into the pitfall. Once all enemy vehicles are destroyed, the player advances to the next Road War level of the game.<br/><br/>After the third and final arena battle, the player engages in a one-on-one crossbow battle with the final boss of the game. The crossbow and ammo are both collected within the mines on the third Road War level.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Mad Max (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "98890": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Viking Tales: Mystery of Black Rock", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"99002": "iPhone/iPad edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2341": "Pirates"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4443": "iPhone"}, "poll": {}, "description": "O-DIN!

The game was also ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993. The NES gamepack has an internal battery to retain game saves; the computer versions came on two disks.<br/><br/>The NES version was among the last titles released for the platform and is relatively rare. The NES version is also noted for having very few sounds or music (mainly just the title theme composed by Jeroen Tel).<br/><br/>The goal of Overlord is to create and protect a network of planetary colonies and defeat a computer adversary who is trying to do the same. There are four skill levels, each represented by an enemy race, and each featuring a progressively stronger opponent. The more advanced a system is, the more freedom a player has when purchasing spacecraft. Higher skill levels also result in different numbers of planets in each system.<br/><br/>The game is controlled using a mouse pointer, and important information is displayed in a message box at the bottom of most screens. Following the introduction screen, the player chooses which planetary system to enter. Planetary systems differ in the number of planets they contain, the types of spacecraft and equipment that can be purchased, and the strength and aggressiveness of the artificial intelligence. The first system contains eight worlds and allows access to only the most basic equipment. The second system has sixteen planets and slightly better equipment. The remaining systems increase in size and strength similarly.<br/><br/>The player and his opponent both begin with control over a single colonized planet in the chosen system. All other planets in between are uninhabited and up for grabs. The player then must set up and maintain thriving colonies on as many planets as possible, and build up an industry and military strong enough to fend off the opponent. Because of the randomness of a system's initial make-up, the order in which planets are colonized has a great subsequent effect upon gameplay.<br/><br/>Before building a colony, planets need to first be terraformed using an atmospheric processor. As a planet's population grows, more taxes can be sent to a player's home starbase. However, in order to survive, colonies need to be supplied with food and energy. The player provides food by buying and placing farming stations on the colony, or by transferring them on starships as cargo. Energy comes from purchasing orbiting solar satellites, but can also be transferred as cargo. Cargo shipments consume fuel, so the player needs to also purchase mining stations. Balancing these and similar factors constitutes the main challenge of the game.<br/><br/>As the player expands his or her empire, he must also create planetary defenses. Defense is achieved by building and maintaining defensive ground armaments on a world. The ability to attack comes from purchasing a battle cruiser and arming it with combinations of both homing and ballistic missiles and hover tanks, then sending the ship to attack an enemy planet's defenses. Planets are taken by eliminating all ground defenses on an enemy world. The only way to win control over a system is to attack and conquer the enemy's starbase in that system. The only way to beat the game is to take the starbase of the last system, Yottsu. Likewise, if the player's home starbase is defeated, the game ends and the player loses.<br/><br/>The NES version game could be considered an early example of real-time strategy, allowing direct control over missile launch, and hover tanks (1 on the map at any given time) on the offensive side, while offering direct control over the plasma cannon defense base and partial control over the pom-pom cannon and lightening field defense bases. The PC version did not have these units, and so could only be remotely considered for this classification.<br/><br/>The NES version is a port of the earlier computer versions. However, there are several differences between them: The NES version uses fewer screens than its PC counterparts, even fewer sounds, and much simplified controls. While the original game uses units of soldiers in platoons which were upgradeable, the NES game condensed the battle elements to missiles and hover tanks against ground defenses, none of which can be upgraded. The message area is much larger in the PC versions, and placed along the right hand side of the screen, compared to bottom center of the NES game. The NES game allows a single saved game to be stored, compared to up to four on the PC games. In the NES version only credits are required to buy craft, whereas the original versions require the player to spend money, minerals, fuel and energy (though this varies depending on the difficulty level). Finally, the use of the docking bays is more complex in the PC games, and the PC versions have a feature where an image of the face of the enemy grows clearer the closer the player is to defeating the game.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Overlord (1990 video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "98893": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Godzilla: Unleashed", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"99008": "French/German Wii edition"}, "average": "6", "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "videogamegenre": {"2159": "Fighting"}, "videogamecharacter": {"11469": "Godzilla"}, "videogamefranchise": {"5958": "Godzilla"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "usersrated": "6", "poll": {}, "vgcharacterversion": {"244681": "Godzilla (Unleashed)"}, "description": "The game is set during a series of unnatural disasters across Planet Earth due to unexplained appearances of large crystals, where the Vortaak alien race are invading once again.

Beware though, the other player can attack and attempt to steal their prize back.<br/><br/>There is additionally a Captain's deck of cards that can earn many rewards, or cause much grief for the other captains, including letting loose the dreaded Kracken.

This desperate battle has recently seen a new player, a secret Agency of Bounty Hunters, attempting to control the endless assaults on inner city life.<br/><br/>Your task: Defeat and arrest criminals, defuse high-tech bombs that threaten to destroy city districts, and prevent assassins from completing their destructive path. You are one of the members of this secretive brotherhood of justice. So...are you ready to survive the crime waves in the big city and uncover the infiltrating androids amongst your team that plan a revolt?<br/><br/>Rogue Agent is a tense cyberpunk adventure game that pitches players against underground networks. The game features detailed plastic miniatures, a large variety of unique criminals to defeat, special icon-driven custom dice, and two different game play modes.<br/><br/>In Rogue Agent, players control an agent working for the shady corporation known as &quot;The Agency&quot;, created to control Rain City's crime rate, which has rapidly outpaced the capabilities of the regular police force. Players win the game by obtaining the most power over the city in a race against the game system that creates a living city in which crime and other challenges await at every corner.<br/><br/>Each round consists of an action phase, which is preceded by an upkeep phase. During this action phase, players score power by successfully eliminating assassins, turning in crime bosses, and defusing high-tech bombs that threaten to destroy whole districts. Through investigation of city areas, players gather resources that will be vital for survival. Positioning collaborators in the different locations of the city aids agents in overcoming confrontations with local thugs. Meanwhile, the city police squad is hot on your trail, hoping to contain the illegal side jobs that agents are known for. The Agency, however, has its own air defenses it can call in for support.<br/><br/>Players can scout locations in search for valuable resources that will help them upgrade their abilities, to get more control over the challenges in the game. As the game develops, agents can upgrade their vehicle, weapon and scout abilities as well as gather information about the true identities of other agents. There might be traitors within the Agency. Some of you might be android agents, secretly planning a revolt. Through careful investigation, players can gather intelligence about the true identity of other players. As the game progresses, traitors amongst the agents could be revealed in the form of androids. These agents have access to new victory conditions &ndash; destroying key locations holding information about android production and eliminating human agents &ndash; in a deadly race for control of the city. The first player to reach eight power wins.<br/><br/>Rogue Agent is a fast-playing, easy-to-learn adventure, resource management, and risk management game using fun, streamlined icon-driven custom dice mechanisms. The Living City System creates a dynamic board with characters and challenges in constant motion, creating unique situations with each play and making Rain City come alive on your gaming table.

The Holmes edition of Dungeons & Dragons still has a following of players, despite the fact that it was only released with information covering the first three levels of play.  Since it was intended only as a bridge between Original and Advanced, no other material was provided or planned for this edition.<br/><br/>Over the years fans have created additional material to complete the game, increasing the number of playable levels to higher limits.  This retroclone subsumes both the original game and the fan-made expansions.<br/><br/>Designer's Commentary:<br/><br/>About 6 months ago, after a Holmes gaming spree, i decided to produce a Blue Book Basic clone which would incorporate Meepo's Companion for extending the Blue Book Basic's game play beyond 3rd level. What I loved about Blue Book (and tried to emulate in the clone as well) was the low page count, the short stat blocks and spell description, and the quick-play rules. The 3rd level cap bothered me, but Meepo's Companion took care of that. So, with Meepo's blessing, i set out to produce Wizards, Warriors &amp; Wyrms (the name an homage to the cover illustration).<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>I think WWW is a great little game, and it works for me and my players, but I'd like to know if it would appeal to others as well. The audience I'm targeting with WWW is people who liked the simplicity of Blue Book Basic, the spartan rules that don't complicate game-play, those who love the good doctor's Basic and would have appreciated further game advancement (thanks Meepo!), and those who (like me) think it's really cool to just have a 40 or so page rulebook for unlimited play. Basically, people who loved Blue Book Basic and would have loved for it to be more than just a stepping stone to &quot;advanced&quot; play.<br/><br/>"}, "98993": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Stranded (2003)", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"99237": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic996731.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2509": "Comedy"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic996731_t.jpg", "description": "In the 3D adventure Stranded you assume the role of a cast away, stranded on a desert-island.<br/><br/>Your objective is simple: Survive!
