The theme in this game, however, is that of rival mining companies fighting for success in the mines/dungeons/caverns &quot;surrounding the underground holdings of Arkonis.&quot;<br/><br/>The base game comes with two sides:  the Dwarven Prospectors vs. the Vanir (dark elves) and their &quot;terrible&quot; spider minions.<br/><br/>The game features upgrading units, hiring mercenaries, and buying weapons and equipment between scenarios.  The combat rules are more streamlined than that of Morheim, and the campaign game is more fleshed out.  You can buy add-ons to the home base of your mining company that can do numerous things for you.  Things that increase income, security, etc.<br/><br/>Many battles take place in the corridors of the mines, but the battle can be taken to a player's home base if needed.  As such, players map out their home bases as they purchase rooms (e.g. jails, vaults, storage, etc), fortifications (e.g. gates, walls, traps, etc), and other assorted upgrades on to them.<br/><br/>RAFM has released other races to play, including Orcs, Undead, and &quot;Reptiliads&quot; (lizard men) to name a few.  In addition, the game works very well with the line of dungeon scenery from Dwarven Forge.  The playing time noted above should be considered the time for one or two scenarios, including the in between campaign management.

For the basic game, players take turns to make an attack by scratching away a panel of their rival to reveal the symbol underneath. When enough wound symbols were found, one of the fighter's 'life' panels would be uncovered and a skull symbol signified his defeat. The dead fighter card would then be given to the winning player who could use the card's 'purse' (an amount of gold listed in the corner) to purchase 'Wondrous Treasure' cards by mailing Merlin with gold equal to the price agreed on a Trading Post card.<br/><br/>Quest cards normally required collectors to study their cards carefully then send the correct ones to Merlin so they could claim a reward of gold. For example, to claim a token worth 100 gold, St. Charity's Quest required you to collect five men with no gold in their purses, which obviously required you to defeat them first.

The rules also include a two-page insert describing &quot;the world's most powerful one-man airplane&quot; in detail.<br/><br/>"}, "5561": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic71216.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Gunter Baars"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2003", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Kinetic", "Chris Mitchell (I)"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic71216_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Adventure", "Ancient", "Animals", "Children's Game", "Dice", "Maze"], "boardgamehonor": ["2003 Kinderspielexperten \"8-to-13-year-olds\" Nominee", "2003 Kinderspielexperten \"8-to-13-year-olds\" Second Place"], "description": "Six ape temples wait to be discovered, but the chambers are locked.

But beware, the gods are fickle and to test their Heroes even further, they often bestow upon them Banes as well as Boons.<br/><br/>Game Description:<br/><br/>This simple card game is very reminiscent of Wiz-War. Players are dealt one of 4 Heroes, each with varying movement, fighting and magic abilities. The Dwarf for example is very tough, but has no magic value at all. Each Hero also has a value for hit points, the amount of Treasure he can have (carry) at any time and also the number of &quot;Boons&quot; (special abilities) he may have. Players are dealt 3 quest cards initially in front of them (public knowledge) and have 5 Adventure cards in hand.<br/><br/>Each turn a player may:<br/><br/>     Discard unwanted cards and draw back to 5 cards.<br/>     Play Encounters and/or Bane cards (always on opponents never on yourself).<br/>     Build the Dungeon.<br/>     Move (collect Peril and Glory tokens).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Players will collect Peril tokens as they move which then makes them targets for others to play Encounter/Bane cards against them (Encounter/Bane cards have a fee to play - which is paid for by the person who the card is played ON with Peril tokens).

Vandenbroucke review - <a target='_blank' href='http://grognard.com/reviews/france44.txt' rel='nofollow'>http://grognard.com/reviews/france44.txt</a>):<br/><br/>France 1944 (Victory Games) is a Mark Herman design.  It's a 130 counter, 1 map game of the breakout and pursuit across France. Units are divisions, I believe.  Components are up to VG's usual high standards.<br/><br/>Complexity is rated as &quot;low,&quot; and solitaire suitability is &quot;medium.&quot;  The most interesting aspect of the game is that it seriously tries to model time over the course of the player's turn. You activate HQs, which can then control a varying number of infantry or armor units, depending on nationality.  There is a track display that you use during movement/combat.  As you make decisions about which actions to take, you branch along the track, limiting your options about what you can do next. Essentially this captures the passage of time required for certain actions.

In late 1940, the Italian Army invaded Egypt beginning the famous North African Campaign of World War II. After a short withdrawal, the Commonwealth forces counterattacked and all but threw the Italians back to Tripoli. Not content to let his southern partner bring disgrace to the Axis arms, Hitler dispatched a German contingent under a new commander: Erwin Rommel. His arrival began a rapid mobile campaign across the rocky sands.  However, by the end of 1942, Rommel had failed in his final bid to seize the Nile Delta and was thrown completely out of the theater by Montgomery's pursuit after El Alamein. Axis fortunes would never rise on the African continent again.<br/><br/>Afrika is a fast paced game of mobile warfare at the operational level. Can you take the Nile? Can your Commonwealth forces kick the Axis armor out of Egypt for good?  This game gives you the tools to find out. The game's easy-to-use supply system (no writing) allows for a correct logistical aspect to the game.<br/><br/>This is the second game in Standard Combat Series by The Gamers that began with the game Stalingrad Pocket. The series rules have been refined after lessons learned with the earlier game. This series of games was designed to off-set The Gamers's line of more complex products.

The player who has the most counties in any given state wins all the electoral votes from that state; in case of a tie, the player who reached the total first wins the state.

Players are given money and three speech cards at the beginning of the game, and whenever 7 or 11 is rolled an additional speech card is auctioned.  Speech cards give players a small number of counties in specific states, allowing players to more effectively focus their campaigning and make comebacks.  On a turn, players roll three dice.  The dice (all the same color) are summed, and the total can be used to campaign in each of the 48 states.

Other things that can happen are takeovers - forcing a resident to sell you his shares, options - a chance to buy shares from the bank or another player for 1/2 price. Trading of shares between players at any time is also encouraged. The game ends either after a set ammount of time, or when a player goes bankrupt.<br/><br/>Movement around the board is accomplished with 3 dice ( regular D6, and 1 special die which has symbols on it to move stock prices either up or down. A player's turn consists of rolling the three dice, moving his marker to the new space, manipulating a stock price up or down by the die roll, then performing the action on the space where you landed (if any).<br/><br/>"}, "5727": {"boardgamedesigner": ["John Edwards"], "poll": [], "name": "Europe at War", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "1985", "usersrated": "57", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic21388_t.jpg", "average": "6.21404", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Jedko Games", "Kokusai-Tsushin Co., Ltd.

In the cards and dice version, three dice are then rolled, with one die determining whether the play result comes from the offensive or defensive cards and the other two determining the result from the speciifed card.  Play takes place on a game board that resembles a football field, and the gamers keep track of the ball position, the down, and the time remaining in the quarter being played.

The game's centerpiece is an options system that lets the Allied player trade Victory Points for changes to his armies and policies that might (or might not) have changed history. Can you, as the Allied commander, repel the Germans with the forces on hand in 1940? How about if you train them better? Or give them a better command structure? Or provide them with more and better anti-aircraft an anti-tank guns? What do you think is the key to victory in the west? Can you, as the German commander, still beat the Allies if the French Army is motorized like the BEF? And how does your strategy change if the French don't build their Maginot Line, but do build a bigger and better air force? Do you still try to sneak through the Ardennes forest with your Panzers? Or do you ignore Allied bombers and wheel across the open plains of northern Belgium in a repeat of the 1914 Schlieffen Plan? Or do you do the unexpected and land a left hook through the Alsace? Your commanders await your orders. The future of Europe is in your hands.<br/><br/>10 May, 1940 ... The German Wehrmacht opened its long-awaited campaign in the West by smashing across the frontiers of Belgium and Holland. For the German High Command, it was seen as a daring move. Hitler's fledgling legions faced the combined armies of France, Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands. These Allied forces had more and better weapons of almost every type, and at least two of the opposing armies, those of France and Britain, were considered to be the best in the world. The Germans had the element of surprise and the new Blitzkrieg tactics of mobile warfare.<br/><br/>Six weeks later, it was all over. The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) had been driven from the continent and the French, Belgians, and Dutch had all capitulated. Hitler had achieved a victory in the west, and the world would never be the same.<br/><br/>But, what if? It didn't have to happen that way ... Bad generalship and correctable flaws in their armies hastened the Allied defeat. What if the High Command had bothered to stay in radio contact with its armies on the frontier? And had then reacted promptly to the developing situation? What if the Maginot Line had been extended to cover the Meuse crossings at Sedan where Guderian's Panzers broke into the Allied rear? What if the BEF had included a strong British mobile corps that could have fought Rommel's Panzers on even terms at Arras? What if the French had prepared to meet the Blitzkrieg by building eight tank divisions instead of three? Or by mechanizing their cavalry the way the Germans did after the Polish campaign? Or even by developing their own blitzkrieg doctrine? The Allies could have taken any or all of these actions, and any of them would have altered the campaign's course.

The first person to accomplish one of each is the winner; once you've accomplished one, you are not allowed to repeat that.<br/><br/>A score is accomplished by moving a pawn from your goal to the opponent's goal.

This goal is achieved by gathering magical items that are most compatible with their character.<br/><br/>At the start, each player is given a secret Wizard card (each with its SpellName and element type) and a hand of cards.  A Magic Item card is then revealed, starting off a round of fighting for it.  Taking turns, the players draw a card from the common deck and play, keep or discard it.  Through these cards, the players deploy heroes and monsters to fight, boost them up with equipment and spells, and kill off certain types of units.  The player with the highest value from his cards wins the Magic Item.  Played cards are discarded, and the next round begins by revealing another Magic Item.<br/><br/>The game ends when all cards in the deck have been drawn.  The players reveal their wizards and tally the points for their artifacts' affinity with their wizard's element type.  The player with the highest score is the winner.  During the game, each player has one chance to guess another player's element type.
