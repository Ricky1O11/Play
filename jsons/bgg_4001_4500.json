One player takes the side of the light and the Dragon Reborn, while another takes the side of the shadow and the Forsaken, in a struggle for control of the Pattern, the ultimate fabric and destiny of the universe.<br/><br/>Each player requires his or her own Hero or Villain deck to play. Each deck features a major character from the Wheel of Time book series. The light side player chooses a hero to play with while the shadow player uses a villain deck. Characters in the side of light include series protagonists Rand al'Thor, Matrim Cauthon, Perrin Aybara, and the other characters of good found within the books. Characters for the shadow include dark friends, as well as Rahvin and the other chosen.<br/><br/>The players attempt to sway the Pattern to their side and amass the might needed to defeat his or her opponent in the final Pattern challenge and win the game. Along the way players will engage in politics, marshaling of armies, magic, and intrigue in an effort to bring characters, troops, and entire kingdoms onto their side.<br/><br/>The core of the Wheel of Time CCG involves rolling dice. Characters and troops, each have different stats corresponding to their skill in politics, intrigue, combat and the one power. These stats translate into dice rolls, used to win challenges and to generate resources.<br/><br/>Every turn, players commit their characters and troops into challenges. Challenges are done via playing challenge cards or initiating the pattern challenge, which is the ultimate objective for both the light and shadow. Unassigned characters and troops can be used to generate resources which in turn, can summon more allies or to attach buffs called advantages.<br/><br/>Players then contest challenges by comparing dice rolls of their committed characters and troops.

The same year Hex appeared in the Danish newspaper Politiken under the name Polygon. Hein introduced the game to the readers on December 26, 1942 and during the following four months gave them a problem each day to begin with - eventually two days a week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The solution would always appear in the following column. It was independently invented by mathematician John Nash in 1947 at Princeton University. In 1952, Parker Brothers marketed a version. They called their version Hex, and the name stuck. Hex has the simplest rules of almost any game: connect your color edges with a path of tokens of your color. There is also a &quot;swap rule&quot; (also known as a pie rule) which compensates for the inherent advantage of the first player.<br/><br/>There are a number of resources for Hex on the internet, including several real-time servers. If you want to play face-to-face, used Hex sets are occasionally available, and you can also make your own set. A Battlemat with 1&quot; hexes can be cut into a 15x15 rhombus grid.

Historically, the Germans planned to break through the thin American defenses in this area, cross the Meuse River, and seize the port of Antwerp in Holland. The German high command hoped that success would force a political settlement on the Western Front, thus allowing Germany to direct its full attention to defeating the Russians. In order to win the game, the German player will almost certainly have to get some units across the Meuse River<br/><br/>The Ardennes, a thickly wooded area on the borders of Germany, Belgium, and Luxembourg, where battle weary U.S. divisions were sent to rest and replace losses, or units freshly arrived from the United States were given their first taste of front line duty. At 5:30am, December 16, 1944, this 85-mile-long sector erupted into what would be the largest, most costly campaign on the Western Front in WWII. The Battle of the Bulge had begun.<br/><br/>During the first week of the battle, three German armies attacked vigorously and relentlessly in an attempt to reach the Meuse River, the major geographical obstacle between them and the great port of Antwerp on the northern coast of Belgium. Stubborn resistance by outnumbered American forces in the difficult terrain of the Ardennes canceled out much of the initial material advantages and surprise the Germans enjoyed. On December 22, Patton's Third Army began attacking the German southern flank north of Arlon, and on the 23rd, the weather finally cleared, allowing Allied air supremacy to be re-asserted over the battlefield.<br/><br/>As the German player, can you break through the American player's front lines and get sufficient forces across the Meuse River before the Allies can bring enough reinforcements to the threatened sector to stop the Ardennes Offensive?

Arne is cheeky, creative, and chaotic. And always spiced with the most unexpected turns. As a player, you change the direction of the game, take over someone&rsquo;s turn, protect your own cards, steal someone else&rsquo;s and wreck the strategy of your opponents. Your luck can turn at any moment: Arne literally goes every which way.<br/><br/>Arne is suitable for all ages. A few practice games, and children from the age of seven start playing seriously. Boys and girls mainly enjoy the high tease factor of the game. But the countless combination possibilities make the game just as much fun for adults. You don&rsquo;t have to know Arne inside out to score well: luck plays an important part. Parents, children, grandparents &hellip; everybody&rsquo;s chances for winning are the same.<br/><br/>There are no words printed on the Arne cards. So the game is universal: people of various mother tongues can play together perfectly well. Another great advantage is that the game does not take long to play: a round of Arne takes ten minutes, a quarter of an hour at the most. However, you will not know who is winning until the last cards have been played. Those who have saved plenty of points can be sent back to the beginning by just one card. And those who were not doing well can snatch victory at the very last minute.<br/><br/>How ARNE Works!<br/><br/>Whoever collects most points wins. Each player first chooses a color and then goes and tries to collect as many points of that color as possible. The other players try to do the same. The point of the game is to sabotage their attempts as much as possible. You do this by making use of the teaser cards. In order to make the game even more fun, there are two sorts of cards:<br/><br/>White cards which you may only play when it is your turn <br/>Black cards which you may play whenever you want to<br/><br/>In practice, all players can play cards at the same time.

Two Austrian forces under Marshal Alvinczy and Lt. General Davidovitch threatened to converge on the French from the north and east, join together at Verona, and march southwards to raise the siege.

In all essential details the &quot;Hyena Game&quot; seems to have been identical to the Ancient Egyptian game of Mehen (The Game of the Coiled One).  The board's shape suggests it may be a distant ancestor of the Game of Goose but the mechanics are so different that this is probably a coincidence.<br/><br/>It was played on a spiraling track, employed stick dice (throwing sticks) of precisely the kind known from Archaic Egyptian contexts, and had two types of pieces, one representing a predatory animal.  The only difference would seem to be that the ancient Egyptians allotted six counters to each player rather than only one.  The Cretan Phaistos Disc may have been a Mehen board, but that remains speculation.<br/><br/>Mehen is the only multi-player ancient Egyptian board game known, the others (Senet, Aseb, Hounds &amp; Jackals, etc.) being all two-player games.  The main function of the serpent-shaped Egyptian god Mehen was to protect the sun-god Ra from his enemies by coiling around him.  In the Old Kingdom, the race-game Mehen took the name and shape of the god: a coiled serpent with the gaming spaces on its back.  As &quot;bodyguard&quot;, Mehen symbolises the sun-god's immediate neighborhood for the deceased.  The deceased walks towards Ra on the back of the serpent-god.<br/><br/>By the early Middle Kingdom, the &lsquo;cuts&rsquo; used on the snake's back of the Mehen board to separate the playing spaces were thought to &lsquo;kill&rsquo; the snake &mdash;which would have been a very threatening and evil thing.  Mehen&rsquo;s role was essential, for if Ra were not protected from his enemies, he might not rise in the morning, which would result in the cessation of all life.  In Egyptian belief, &lsquo;life&rsquo; applied not only to the living but also to the dead, who were believed to travel with the sun and to rise, reborn, with him at dawn.  From that time forth, the game apparently ceased to be played, possibly banned and forbidden.<br/><br/>"}, "4149": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Barrel of Monkeys", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "1965", "usersrated": "619", "boardgamefamily": ["3D Games", "Animals: Apes / Monkeys"], "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic336380_t.jpg", "average": "3.62625", "statistics": [], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Children's Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic336380.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["German edition", "Hasbro Elefun & Friends edition", "Hasbro Pen edition", "Lakeside cylindrical paper edition", "Lakeside Edition 1965", "Lakeside Giant edition", "Lakeside Giant Edition 1969", "Milton Bradley Barrel edition"], "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamepublisher": ["Club Earth", "Hasbro", "Lakeside", "MB Spiele", "Milton Bradley"], "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Animals", "Children's Game"], "age": "3", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Did you know that this is not just a children's toy, but also a game?<br/><br/>Try to hook a chain of monkeys until you stop or your chain falls apart.

The game is a fictional representation of the breakout of World War II. Five minor countries become engulfed in a tremendous conflict for territory waged by Great Blue and Big Red, the major countries.<br/><br/><br/>Blitzkrieg is one of the classic Avalon Hill war games that set up the military simulation board game hobby.<br/><br/>Blitzkrieg is a board game with printed cardboard square pieces played on a hard mapboard. The mapboard is hard paper stock that is the same as what one would find with a Monopoly playboard. Printed on the mapboard is a map on a hexagonal grid (hex spaces, or simply &quot;hexes&quot;), and terrain for land, beach, cities, rivers, roads, mountain, desert, and borders. There are a few charts, such as the one for the combat results table, and a die for random outcomes.<br/><br/>The cardboard pieces represent large military units. There are brigades, divisions, squadrons and air wings. The different types of military units represented are infantry, airborne, rangers, armor, shock artillery, fighters and bombers. Navel action is allowed but abstracted.<br/><br/>There are three levels of the game, the basic game (simplest), advanced (all the complicated rules), and tournament (fast play with advance rules). There are optional rules for the advanced game. The basic game only includes the land game, no naval invasions, and is the best starter tool for new gamers. The basic game has a more simplified combat results table. The advanced game adds special unit abilities, supply restrictions, air war and strategic bombing, naval invasions, commando raids, special desert supply restrictions, etc. Tournament play was intended for play at game conventions such as the annual world board-gaming convention in Harrisburg, Pa.<br/><br/>The nice thing about Blitzkrieg is that it uses a system that is similar to most other hexgames. So once one learns one game, the learning curve of a similar game was not as steep. Such is the case with many of the old Avalon Hill Classics, once you learned one game all of the other played the same way with some minor variation, only the campaign is different.<br/><br/>The basic play used unit types and combat ratings. As expected, infantry would have different abilities from armor or artillery. Each unit had rating printed in large print on the piece, (or &quot;chits,&quot; as they are called). For example, take a 1-4 infantry brigade. The &quot;4&quot; is the movement factor per turn, so the unit can move four hexes in clear terrain per turn. Movement along a road is 1/3, so a 1-4 infantry can move 12 hexes if moved solely along a road. Each side is permitted to move all of their units up to their full movement allowance. The first rating, the &quot;1&quot; in this case, is the combat factor. Combat is worked out in odds, so that if one moves his 1-4 infantry next to the enemies&rsquo; 1-4 infantry, the combat odds are 1-1 (not very good in combat). There is nothing preventing one from ganging up on an enemy unit, and in fact this is the general tactic even in real life. So if one brought up another brigade into the attack there would be two 1-4 infantry brigades against the enemy's single brigade for 2-1 odds. For example, if the enemy had a 4-4 infantry division sitting on a clear hex and on their turn a player brings up three 4-4 infantry divisions adjacent to have combat, this would be at 12-4 odds, which reduce to 3-1. Then one would consult the combat results table under the 3-1 column and roll the die. The results would resolve the combat and tell what losses there were, and who had to retreat. Obviously, the higher the odds will favor that side.<br/><br/>Also in combat, terrain would impact combat. A defender in a city or mountain would have their defense rating doubled. For example, a 1-4 infantry in the mountains would defend as a combat rating of 2. Odds are rounded in favor of the defender. From the example above if that 4-4 infantry was defending in a city against those three 4-4 infantry, the odds would now be 12-8, only 1-1 odds (better bring up more attacking troops).<br/><br/>When Blitzkrieg came out this type of map wargame was relatively new, so this game was very novel in its time. It is still a good two player game and there is enough variation so it won't get stale. It has a WWII or early cold war feel to it. The two antagonists are abstract, Big Red and Great Blue, which had more to do with the simple printing colors Avalon Hill used back in the early 1960's than any national commentary.<br/><br/>In the late seventies and eighties many panned Blitzkrieg since many games seem to grind to a stalemate in the middle of the map. But as a training game this isn't such a bad thing, since that can give a new gamer some confidence to play to a draw.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Avalon Hill First Edition", "Avalon Hill Second edition"], "name": "Blitzkrieg", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "5.82265", "boardgameexpansion": ["12163"], "usersrated": "630", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "age": "12"}, "4169": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Ian Livingstone", "Martin McKenna"], "average": "5.45882", "poll": [], "name": "Deathtrap Dungeon: Card Game", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "4", "yearpublished": "1998", "usersrated": "17", "boardgamefamily": ["Climbing Games"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic20438_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Martin McKenna"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["EIDOS Interactive"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic20438.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Eidos First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Fantasy"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "The Deathtrap Dungeon card game came with some copies of the PC version of the Deathtrap Dungeon computer game by EIDOS. The cards themselves feature a whole host of nasties, including Skeletons, Orcs and Bloodbeasts. The game is actually based on an ancient Chinese card game called &quot;Zheng Shang Yu&quot;.<br/><br/>The goal of Deathtrap Dungeon is to 'kill' all the monsters by discarding cards, all of which have a creature on them. The quicker you do it the better. All the cards are dealt out and the player who gets the 'Exploding Pig' starts by discarding the Pig and another card.<br/><br/>Players arrange their cards into sets, e.g. Orcs, Skeletons, Bloodbeasts etc, and the first player puts down any number of cards from the same set, face up. The next player can then play if they can put down the same number of cards, but with a higher value. Therefore Four Skeletons, which are worth 3 each, could be followed by Four Warriors, which are worth 5 each. If a player cannot do this, they pass and play moves on to the next player.<br/><br/>The winner of the hand is the last player to put down the set with the highest value. This person then starts the next round.

Veracruz is an operational simulation of General Winfield Scott's Mexican campaign, which took place between March and September 1847. The invasion was an American effort to end the Mexican War by marching into the heart of Central Mexico to capture the capital, Mexico City. Diplomatically, it ended the decades of border disputes and opened up vast new territories, which in turn led to the Gold Rush of '49 and the Great Compromise of 1850.<br/><br/>European commanders and military experts, when viewing the upcoming conflict in 1846, could not see anything but a complete Mexican victory, given the size of her army with it's European system of training and assembly. But the European System was a hollow shell that worked with even less validity in the rigid hierarchical Mexican social structure. The entire system was exacerbated by a succession of generals and other leaders who were inept on a scale that dwarfs even the darkest Union days of the Civil War. On the other hand, many of the best generals of the American Civil War distinguished themselves here as lieutenants and captains: Robert E. Lee (engineers, Scott's chief scout), Ulysses S. Grant, George Pickett, Thomas J. Jackson, Braxton Bragg, Jubal Early, George G. Meade, Phillip Kearney, David D.

The fifth edition brings the publication up to today&rsquo;s high standards.<br/><br/>So what&rsquo;s different or new, what have we done? Well the main thing we have done is to combined the last few years of work on the forum with the existing edition and to expand the scope of the concept which is Arcana.<br/><br/>The fifth edition will not come alone it now comes complete with a new Armies of Acrana website.<br/> The Book<br/><br/>First it&rsquo;s now all colour with a new foreword and introduction in which we expanded the background of Arcana to give it some extra meaning. Then the book is divided into sections, the first is the basics principles with a new learn to play section for those who are new to wargaming.<br/><br/>The second section contains all the turn sequences reworked to follow the actual turn sequence. Again some sections have been updated to follow what has been developed for the forum, especially the flying section.<br/><br/>The next section is &lsquo;To Battle&rsquo; - this has had a major reworking. We have added terrain generators, a new scenario - Attrition, tournament rules. In the army building section we have revamped the vehicle, war machine and creature creation parts all now carry example of how to make them and are much easier to read and use.<br/><br/>The spells have had little done to them other than some realigning by Thane.<br/><br/>The last section contains the army lists and templates.

It is the first in the series to cover the Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland in World War II.<br/><br/>The German breakthrough at Sedan opened the way for Guderian&rsquo;s dash to the English Channel. What is not commonly known is that this advance proceeded at a pace which the German General Staff thought to be too aggressive, if not rash. It is not an understatement to say that had the French significantly threatened the Sedan bridgehead, the 1940 campaign could have developed quite differently. The French lost their best opportunity to do just that at the village of Stonne. In GD&rsquo;40, players have the chance to change history. A successful French player may cause OKW to put the brakes on Guderian&rsquo;s advance, which could give the French army time to react to the surprise German blow at Sedan. Failure will allow history to take its course&mdash;one of the most decisive victories of modern time. GD&rsquo;40 is the first in a series of TCS games which will portray the Grossdeutschland throughout the war&mdash;from an infantry regiment in 1940 to a Panzer Corps in 1945.

However, ties end that month's play (players draw fresh supply points each month, and the game ends after 20 months).<br/><br/>Second significant mechanic is the use of (limited) supply points to activate stacks of units when it's your turn. Like games such as We the People/Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage/Rommel in the Desert/Napoleon, you don't have the resources to activate all of your units each turn, you need to decide what the current priority is in line with the current situation. Activation generally allows you to either move stacks or attack with stacks, but with an increased expenditure of supply points, you can take more powerful 'breakthrough' turns involving both movement and attack.<br/><br/>These mechanics (unpredictable turn order, limited ability to activate units each turn) create a game of fluid tactical situations, where your planning has to be flexible - you never know who will get the next turn.<br/><br/>The Allied player has to break out of the beach head and capture additional supply ports (which raise the number of supply points available to the Allies, and hence the number of activations possible) en route to Germany. The German player must contain the Allies in Normandy for as long as possible before falling back to the Rhine, while also denying the valuable supply ports to the Allies as long as possible. The Allies are up against a tight timetable; the Germans must work against as increasing disadvantage in supply points.<br/><br/>Victory is generally determined by the difference in numbers between German units West of the Rhine and Allied units East of the Rhine at game end. Allied paratroops, the German Bulge offensive, reinforcements/replacements and strategic movement add to the game.

Each player is assigned one of the four categories of businesses, each of which sells goods or services costing 100, 200, 300 or 400 $.  Each player starts with 1000 $.  First player to amass 100 Consumer points wins.<br/><br/>On your turn, you roll a die.  If it is 1-4, you go visit the corresponding dealer.  If you rolled yourself, you pick one of the three others.  If you rolled 5-6, you draw a Consumer card and then go visit a dealer of your choice.  The Consumer cards give small Consumer Point bonuses or penalties, or small cash awards (up to 500 $).  At the beginning of each round, all players receive 100 $ each.<br/><br/>Each dealer has six cards, one Catch card, two Rip-Off cards and three Good Deal cards.  They are spread in front of him, face down, in any order of the dealer's choice.  The consumer then decides how much he will spend (100-400 $) and forks the money over to the vendor.  The dealer then rolls a die and picks up the corresponding card (left to right) from his spread; next, he chooses one of the five remaining cards.  Finally, he picks up the card corresponding to the amount spent (100 $ - first card, and so on up to 400 $ - fourth card).  Thus the dealer has limited control over what choice to offer to the consumer.<br/><br/>The consumer then draws one of the three cards proferred by the dealer (still face down).  If a Good Deal, he receives 10-40 Consumer points.  If a Catch, he receives half as much.  If a Rip-Off, he *loses* 10 Consumer points but has the option of suing.<br/><br/>To sue, pay 500 $ to the Bank, then dice off against the vendor.  If the consumer rolls lower, he lost the suit.  If he tied or bested the vendor, he is awarded compensation depending on the margin of success.  The least result is that he recovers the lost 10 CPs and is refunded the court costs by the vendor.

And even if they didn't, they should have.<br/><br/>Thus was born Fightball, a weird version of basketball with at least three balls &mdash; maybe more, we're not sure &mdash; two goals, and extremely violent gameplay. The sport is played on the streets and overseen by flying robot referees, and it's played by the weirdest assortment of folks you're likely to see in a game.<br/><br/>Basically, Fightball is like basketball. Players build a &quot;court&quot; out of 24 cards and play four rounds. The play is fast and furious, with each player playing as fast as he can. When one player reaches the &quot;BUZZ&quot; card (at the bottom of the deck) the round is over. Now, players score each location on the court, looking for a sequence of cards starting with a player, then a ball, then a shot. Other cards, like blockers, can affect the quality of the shot. Some shots succeed, and are worth points. Others fail, and are worth nothing. The highest score at the end of four rounds wins the game!<br/><br/>Fightball was released as three sets of double decks, and any two decks can be played against one another.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition (Aztecs vs. The Dark)", "English first edition (Cavaliers vs. Team Sport)", "English first edition (Texas Wildcats vs. The Cruisers)"], "age": "12", "name": "Fightball", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Building", "Variable Player Powers"], "average": "5.8764", "usersrated": "214", "boardgamefamily": ["Sci-Fi Sports"]}, "4353": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic69066.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Greg Costikyan"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1979", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Rick Bryant", "Redmond A.

Ship movement is Newtonian and three-dimensional: (X,Y) and (X,Z) position charts are used to track where the ships are at any given time.  Players spend ship points to buy ship components and technology points to buy improved technologies; victory points are earned for destroying pods and ships and for being the last player to have ships in play.

The frightfully fearsome feudal lord Fieso has held the fascinating fairy Fabula in captivity since the famous February festivities. In order to free the fairy must you redeem her from the Fieso's fetid and fusty feculent fetter. Frustrated you flee into the Finnish fjords in order to fetch a few of the fascinating fetishes so highly favored by the foul prince. Frantically you begin bartering with the local folks: a few Florins will get you some Fish which can be traded for Flowers, which again can be traded for Fur, Fruits, Flutes, Fettucine, Furniture, Fuel, Fiddles or maybe even a fridge. When your finances allow you to obtain 3 different fetishes you have won the game.<br/><br/>In Fische Fluppen Frikadellen, players are traders running (or sailing on a raft!) around a town, visiting various market stalls in order to buy, sell, or trade goods.  There are three different types of stalls in the game.  Merchants will sell you a specific good of the 5 base goods in the game according to current market prices, and will also buy a specific good from you, also according to market prices.  Traders will accept a specific good and give you two of a specific good in return.  Finally, there are dealer stalls which offer fetishes.  They each want specific combinations of goods, offering you a fetish in return.  There are three different fetishes in the game, and the first player to trade for all three fetishes wins!<br/><br/>Furthermore, whenever a player visits a market stall, a special ability of that stall activates.  These special abilities cause all sorts of game events, such as production of goods at merchants (you can't buy a good at a merchant if he doesn't have any available), price increases of goods, getting an extra turn or free commodity, changing the position of two merchants, etc.  Often times, players will need to utilize these special abilities to conquer their goals.<br/><br/>The really unique feature of Fische Fluppen Frikadellen is that there are three different versions of the game, so it can be played by up to 15 people on three different, interconnected tables!  You'll need one copy of the game for every 5 players.<br/><br/>At the start of a 15-player game, for example, there will be three boards, with 5 players at each board.  Each board is set up individually by the players starting there, and there are 36 merchants in the game with only 12 of them used per board, so it is very possible for each board to be significantly different than the others!  Furthermore, there will only be one of the three fetishes available at each board, so players will need to sail off to all three boards over the course of the game in order to win!  This means picking up all of your things and moving to a different table.<br/><br/>You aren't allowed to peek at the other tables before you move, which means it is a complete surprise what the market conditions and various stalls will be on the board that you move to.  This mechanic also means that there will not always be an equal amount of players at each board throughout the game, so players at boards with less players will likely get turns more frequently than players at boards with more players; another reason to leave your current board for a different one!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Version A", "Version A 'Auswahlliste Spiel Des Jahres 2003' Edition", "Version B", "Version B 'Auswahlliste Spiel Des Jahres 2003' Edition", "Version C", "Version C 'Auswahlliste Spiel Des Jahres 2003' Edition"], "name": "Fische Fluppen Frikadellen", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pick-up and Deliver"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "920", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "average": "6.62052", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["MN 0086 November Gaming - BGGcon 2015 Report"]}, "4371": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jim Dietz"], "poll": [], "name": "Last Man Standing", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Modular Board", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "1999", "usersrated": "26", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic27640_t.jpg", "average": "4.57308", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Jolly Roger Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic27640.jpg", "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Fighting", "Humor", "Spies/Secret Agents"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "Each player chooses one of eight characters that spoof popular spy/action-movie characters or actors: James Blonde, Emma Shell, Austin Flowers, Indiana Smith, Jackie Chang, Dirty Larry, Shift, or Arnold Weissenmeiner.

It is played on a rectangular board made up of two Alquerque boards with 22 plain black and white pieces. Capturing is compulsory and a series of captures may be made by the same piece on a turn, as in checkers. Unique aspects of the game include its method of capture (either approaching or withdrawing your piece from a line of enemy pieces), and the &quot;vela partie&quot; (debt game) after winning a decisive game (the winner must let the loser &quot;eat&quot; one man each turn for 17 consecutive moves). Because of the density of the board (only one open spot at the games beginning) and the unique method of capture, strategy is complex and enigmatic, with fewer pieces often beating more pieces. (While very different, the game feels somewhat like Zertz due to the above.)<br/><br/>Historical note from one game box: Some Fanorona matches were devoted to the Gods and last but not least the fate and colonialization of Madagascar (1895) supposed to be solved unbloody with Fanorona on the game table.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["La M\u00e8che Rebelle edition", "Mitra Portuguese edition", "nestorgames edition", "Northwest Corner Deluxe Edition", "Northwest Corner first edition", "Oficina do Aprendiz Edition", "Parker German Edition", "Das Spiel Edition", "Ta\u015f Devr\u0131 Oyuncak Turkish edition"], "average": "6.39886", "name": "Fanorona", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement"], "age": "7", "usersrated": "175", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Alquerque", "Combinatorial", "Indian Type War Games"]}, "4388": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic18900.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["King's Road", "Neue Spiele im alten Rom"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Reiner Knizia"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2001", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Rodger B.

This collection brings together three of the finest, covering three very different aspects of the Roman Empire: Hannibal versus Rome, Imperium and Circus Maximus.<br/><br/>Hannibal versus Rome is a 30-minute two-player game depicing the initial struggle for supremacy between Rome and Carthage, which finally established Rome as the leading power in the Mediterranean. It draws on the events of the Second Punic War, during which Hannibal crossed the Alps with his elephants, and defeated Rome in the battle of Cannae. The Roman general Scipio succeeded in moving the fighting away from Italy, into Spain and Africa, where he defeated the Carthaginians at Zama.<br/><br/>The map covers the Western Mediterranean. Players move Legions and Fleets, deciding conflicts by the use of cards in order to determine who will be the dominant power in the Mediterranean region.<br/><br/>Imperium (a game for two to five players) focuses on Rome's political and territorial expansion during the Imperial period. Powerful families controlled the individual provinces in order to increase their wealth and power in Rome, until the Roman Empire reached its zenith in size in the year 100 under the Emperor Trajan.<br/><br/>In each round the two to five players distribute markers onto areas of the Empire, with control of one area being decided each round. The players need to have the right influence at the decisive moment to take control, without neglecting long-term development. It is a game of planning and timing.<br/><br/>Circus Maximus leads us into the heart of Rome itself with its renowned public entertainment for the masses; chariot racing.<br/><br/>Chariot races were immensely popular in Rome. The Circus Maximus offered room for 200,000 spectators who avidly followed the races, roaring and cheering on their favourites. The courageous charioteers were divided into teams distinguished by different colours. The most successful were worshipped as heroes, but the risks were high and many paid for their fame and daring with their lives.<br/><br/>Each of two to five players controls a team of three chariots. In a game of pure tactics, players receive five movement cards that they can assign each turn to individual chariots as they wish. The first to bring all three across the finish line wins the game and the laurel wreath.<br/><br/>Note: the 3 games in this were previously released in Neue Spiele im alten Rom<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["GMT boxed edition"], "average": "6.29593", "name": "Rome: Imperium, Circus Maximus, Hannibal vs Rome", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Area Movement"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "437", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games", "Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Ancient Rome", "Cities: Rome"]}, "4390": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2428656.png", "boardgameimplementation": ["Carcassonne"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Klaus-J\u00fcrgen Wrede"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2002", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Johann R\u00fcttinger"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Hans im Gl\u00fcck Verlags-GmbH", "999 Games", "Devir", "Hobby World", "Lautapelit.fi", "Midgaard Games", "MINDOK", "Rio Grande Games", "Smart Ltd", "Z-Man Games"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2428656_t.png", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Prehistoric"], "description": "Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers is a standalone game in the Carcassonne series set in the stone age.<br/><br/>As in other Carcassonne games, players take turns placing tiles to create the landscape and placing meeples to score points from the map they're creating.

Some are easy and cheap to throw together in a weekend, others actually involve scripts or more than one take! Sometimes you'll be rolling in the cash from your Films, sometimes you'll need to beg, borrow or... something else! Gather the right Stars in your stable and keep the cash flowing to keep them from leaving you for your competition. If you have the right talent and a lot of green, the rest will all fall into place, right?<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href='http://www.DeathTech.com/' rel='nofollow'>http://www.DeathTech.com/</a><br/><br/>"}, "4442": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic154563.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Tamara Jannink", "Joris Wiersinga"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2002", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Herman Haverkort", "Jacqueline Jannink"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Splotter Spellen"], "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic154563_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Real-time"], "description": "From the Splotter website:<br/>Alexander, the Great King, will visit the Oracle!

It was included in the Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine Issue #103.<br/><br/>The May 16, 1863 Battle of Champion Hill was the largest, bloodiest, and most significant action of Grant&rsquo;s Vicksburg Campaign. 32,000 advancing Union soldiers met 23,000 Confederates in a fierce struggle for a vital crossroads roughly halfway between Vicksburg and Jackson, Mississippi. The field was dominated by bald Champion Hill, from which Confederate artillery opened fire on the Union army at 9:45 A.M. The first Federal assault on the hill drove the Southerners back with bayonets and clubbed muskets. As the Union soldiers tried to reform and consolidate their gains, they were swept away by a counterattack led by John Bowen&rsquo;s Missourians and Arkansans. Ulysses S. Grant ordered more men towards the hill and Bowen&rsquo;s Confederates were themselves driven off, compelling a general retreat. Southern Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman was killed while directing a desperate rearguard action that enabled most of the Confederate army to escape towards Vicksburg. The decisive Union victory at Champion Hill was instrumental in forcing the Confederates out of the open field and into a doomed position inside the walls of Vicksburg.<br/><br/>Brief summary of rules:<br/>Stacking:<br/>&bull; Up to 2 units may stack, unless optional stacking rule is used, which allows 5 units in one hex, as long as only one is of brigade level or higher.<br/>&bull; Units in a stack must attack the same target.

ZOCs do not extend across river/creek hexsides, except at a ford or bridge.  ZOC does extend across streams.<br/>&bull; Units entering EZOC must stop moving.<br/>&bull; No unit may voluntarily leave an EZOC except by combat results<br/><br/>Combat Restrictions:<br/>&bull; Units may only attack or be attacked once per phase.<br/>&bull; Units may not split up their strength points to attack into separate adjacent hexes.<br/>&bull; Units may attack all adjacent units of a group if desired.<br/>&bull; Before rolling  the die, the attacker may choose to reduce the combat odds (e.g., use the 2:1 table when attacking at 3:1).<br/>&bull; Cavalry units attacked only by infantry may retreat 2 hexes before combat is resolved (opt.).  The attacking units may enter the cavalry unit&rsquo;s vacated hex, but they may not select an alternate target.<br/><br/>Attacker Effectiveness (&ldquo;Ar&rdquo; results):<br/>&bull; Attackers forced to retreat are flipped to their ineffective side.

Strong offense generally pushes past a weak D and there's not a lot you can do except be lucky. But by picking evenly-matched teams, it does require some forethought to work your team to a score.

Players are not ensuring victory, but simply improving their chances in the end game which is decided by the giant green ghost spinner.<br/><br/>Originally published by Transogram; revived 1997 by Marx Toys.<br/><br/>Fan Home Page: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.greenghostgame.com' rel='nofollow'>http://www.greenghostgame.com</a><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition", "Second Edition"], "name": "Green Ghost", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move", "Set Collection"], "average": "5.12465", "usersrated": "43", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Children's Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["3D Games", "Ghosts"]}, "4461": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Chauvinist Pigs", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Memory", "Partnerships"], "yearpublished": "1991", "usersrated": "22", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Pigs"], "maxplayers": "40", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic33394_t.jpg", "average": "4.32727", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Tiger Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic33394.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Tiger First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Deduction", "Humor", "Memory", "Party Game", "Trivia", "Word Game"], "age": "18", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "The game that finally resolves the Battle of the Sexes.<br/><br/>Hey Guys!

If one person stands still and another walks, the rainbow remains in place for the one and retreats for the other - simultaneously. It is one-sided, like a one-way path, invisible from the other side. That is obviously magic. - Piers Anthony<br/><br/>Xanth, the magical, pun-filled world of Piers Anthony's fantasy novels, comes to life in this hilarious game. As one of many colorful characters, players must travel across land and sea in order to fulfill their wild and wacky quests. For 1 to 6 players, ages 12 to adult.<br/><br/>Contents: 162 playing cards, 15 dice, 6 pawns, 12 chits, gameboard, rulebook, sorting tray.<br/><br/>There are 3 card types used in the game, Chair Actors (Characters), Events/Encounters &amp; Quests. The majority are E/E cards. Only Character cards have colour illustrations, the others being monochrome or text only. A small errata sheet is included.<br/><br/>Simple &amp; Easy Game<br/>Each player starts with 2 character cards and a Quest card (which determines their starting area on the map), with the character's Cunning &amp; Strength, plus a Talent - an extra rule or exception they can use, tying in to the character in the novels. <br/>Each turn starts by drawing an Event/Encounter card, playing it if it's a Disaster. Other E/E cards include objects to assist in some way, commonly in combat, hazards to play on other players, additional characters (mixed in from those not in play) etc., often limited by area (you have to get to some areas to activate some objects, for instance). <br/>If there is no Disaster, players move their pawn across the board (normally 2 areas, Characters, Event cards &amp; the area characteristics can modify this). The other players may then play Events or Creatures on them, possibly limited by the area. Characters can attempt to avoid encounters (roll dice under Cunning), or may fight (roll a die under Strength to cause a wound, repeat until one side loses). The specific encounter or creature may modify this, as can many E/E cards. <br/>Players start from scratch if their character is beaten, but can heal by use of certain cards or in certain areas. <br/>The first to complete their Quest wins.<br/><br/>Still Simple &amp; Easy but Longer Game<br/>Same as before, but complete 2 or 3 Quests.

Depending on the card they may: win additional coins or Dragonstones; place spells on other players; or win scoring points.<br/><br/>The Legend : <br/>Many, many years ago, an enchanted forest lay hidden between two great mountain ranges. The forest valley was home to several kingdoms whose rival princes battled with each other to unite the entire realm under one flag. To gain advantage, princes vied with each other to collect powerful magic amulets called Dragonstones.<br/>Like many royals, over time the princes began to prefer the comfort and safety of their fortified castles. Rather than risk their own lives by venturing out to search for these amulets, they paid handsome rewards to those who could bring them stones. The allure of the princes' wealth soon filled the enchanted forest with all manner of wizards, witches, dwarves, goblins, and many other enchanted creatures - all in pursuit of the magic Dragonstones.<br/>This enchanted land is now almost entirely lost to legend. Yet, at a cozy inn, in a small forgotten village, the memory of Dragonstones is kept alive by the inn's ancient proprietor. Even today, a nod from a knowing traveler may persuade him to recount some of the ancient tales.

You'll have to face the usual: running your business, paying taxes, getting an education, joining social clubs and much more. You win by retiring with $100 000.<br/><br/>With six players, all businesses in the game start owned; with less players, the Treasury owns the remaining businesses. When playing with two or three, each player can own two sets of businesses at start. The businesses sell various Status Symbols (required to move up in society) in addition to &quot;Other Purchases&quot;. Credit can be used to buy things --the cards have no limit, but whenever you land on a Credit Due square you must pay the card off entirely, plus 10% interest. Bankruptcy means you start all over again.<br/><br/>You can win up to 3 different status symbols at a time, and you cannot buy one of a class lower than your own. Money comes in through a payoff/salary square on each class ring (and a few other windfall squares), and changes hands with purchases in a zero-sum fashion.<br/><br/>To enter the Middle Class, you must have $500, three status symbols and either a Night School diploma or a Country Club membership. Or you can marry. Status symbols now beneath you must be auctioned off. High Society requires $3000, 3 status symbols, and either a University diploma or a Yacht Club membership. Or marry again.

Each player gets 3 to 5 pawns (based on the number of players) which are placed on a 4 by 4 starting grid.  The track is four squares wide. During the setup, the players randomly cover some of these squares with wooden blocks to provide obstacles that prevent movement. The location of the blocks is determined by several die rolls.  This random setup provides for a different track each race.<br/><br/>Movement of the players' pawns is controlled by a special six sided chess die. The die contains the six basic chess pieces: King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight and Pawn. Each turn a player will roll the chess die to determine everyone's move for that turn.  Once all players have moved, the next player on the left rolls the die for the next round. When moving, the player must move one of his pieces based on the indicated chess piece.  Like chess, the player may not move off the edge of the board or over one of the obstacles, except for the knight move.  If the player captures one of the piece of another player, the two pieces exchange positions.<br/><br/>The first piece to cross the finish line scores 15 points with each successive piece scoring one less (14, 13, 12, etc).  There are small bonuses for certain finishing conditions (first to have all pieces finish, three positions in a row, etc).<br/><br/>The game comes with a rolled up, laminated board, 25 pawns, 24 wooden blocks for obstacles, one normal die and one chess die.<br/><br/>"}, "4483": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Brian Armstrong", "Andy Cox"], "poll": [], "name": "The Buntu Circus", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Building"], "yearpublished": "1997", "usersrated": "9", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic253825_t.jpg", "average": "5.77778", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["The Buntu Circus"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic253825.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["The Buntu Circus edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "The Buntu Circus was independently published by a group of UK gamers calling themselves The Buntu Circus. It is an abstract strategy game for 2 to 4 players. The board is divided into a 14 x 14 grid. Each square has a combination of one of eight colours and one of twelve symbols, arranged in a symmetrical pattern on the board.<br/><br/>A deck of cards has one card per square on the board, matching colour and symbol. Each player gets a hand of eight cards and a set of counters and rubber hoops in their own colour. These are metallic colours, distinct from the board colours.<br/><br/>In turn each player draws and then plays a card from their hand, placing or removing a counter on one of the appropriate squares on the board - each colour and symbol combination appears in two places on the board, and has two cards which can match.<br/><br/>The idea is to get a number of linked rows of five counters in your colour, orthogonally and/or diagonally. The target number of rows depends on the number of players - five in a two player game and less if there are more players. Once a row has been formed, it is designated by placing hoops over each of the counters in the row.<br/><br/>There are couple of further wrinkles. Most importantly are the &quot;power&quot; colours. At the start, each player has power in a single board colour, determined randomly. This allows the player to use a card of that colour to move an counter on the board (their own or another player's) either to an adjacent square of that colour or from a square of that colour to an adjacent square. Creating a row of five gains the player power over the colour of the middle square of the row - this is marked by removing the central counter from its hoop and placing it on one of the power colour markers to the side of the board. In this way players gain power over new colours. If another player already has power in that colour, their power is removed - but the player who gained power merely displaces them - they do not gain power in the colour. Gaining power over a colour in which you already have power reinforces power in the colour. The player &quot;hoops&quot; the power counter and this prevents any other player from gaining a row that would give them power in that colour. In effect they have a &quot;lock&quot; on that colour. A final wrinkle comes with the discard piles. Played cards can be discard to one of four face-up piles. Once one of the four &quot;draw&quot; decks is exhausted, the adjacent discard pile is turned over - but not shuffled. This allows long-term strategies of &quot;stacking&quot; the deck with particular colours or symbols.<br/><br/>The quality of the components is superb. The board is big and colourful, the symbols clear and distinct. The player's counters are chunky plastic discs which come in little cannisters like pill-boxes. The hoops are rubber-like rings which come in individual cloth bags.

Next, each player places their alien chit on the center square of their edge of the board (on the grid, but outside the fence). They take turns moving the alien up to 3 spaces, and then they may choose to tip cows. Tipping starts from the alien and stops at a Cow Lock -- the alien cannot tip a cow directly into a cow of the same color.

You may choose to use the 4 joker tiles as wild cards.<br/><br/>On the other side, &quot;Puncola&quot;, you are creating a 6x6 square picture by matching the edges of the tiles with a similar pattern on an adjacent tile. At the corners of certain tiles is a 1/4 circle that is paired with 3 other tiles to form a complete circle.<br/><br/>&quot;Domino-Puncola&quot; is an alternate version of the game that adds competition. Each player picks 5 tiles at random and, in turn, tries to match an edge of the &quot;Puncola&quot; side to a tile on the table. If that person cannot place his/her tile, he/she draws a new one. The first person to place all of his/her tiles is the winner.<br/><br/>"}, "4034": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic51979.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Fred DaMert", "Dan Gilbert"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2000", "maxplayers": "3", "boardgameartist": ["Dan Gilbert"], "boardgamepublisher": ["DaMert Company", "University Games"], "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic51979_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "description": "Race from one side of the board to the other by matching heads and tails of the frogs as you go.

The invasion began January 22, 1944, under the code name Operation Shingle. It had the Alban Hills and the isolation of the German army as its objective. Failing in this, Allied troops would have to hold until relieved. Here Hitler recognized Germany's great chance to destroy an Allied invasion.

The original American commander was not bold, and lost. So the idea with AB was to explore the what if's. At that time, I had been working on designing games for about eight years (since I first discovered the AH games.) Before that, I was always interested in the details of history, and how they were connected. AH wargames were the first time I saw someone else thinking the same way, and doing it in a novel way.  I was always building on that.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I had been designing a similar game, called Italy, which incorporated the rest of the Italian theater, with a smaller scale map of the Anzio area (ie, two interrelated games, one strategic and the other operational). But when Dave's game came in I thought it did a better job of the Anzio section.

Star Munchkin is a complete game using the best-selling Munchkin rules (with a few new twists like Sidekicks), and it can be combined with any other Munchkin items.<br/><br/>Part of the Munchkin series.<br/><br/>Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.<br/><br/>Note: The 2012 edition of Star Munchkin from Pegasus Spiele includes the first expansion, Star Munchkin 2: The Clown Wars.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["English edition 2015", "English edition 2016", "English first edition", "English first edition, Seventh Printing", "English first edition, sixth printing", "English second edition (rules/card changes)", "French first edition", "German edition 2016", "German first edition", "German third edition", "Hebrew edition", "Hobby World Russian edition", "Italian Edition", "Polish first edition", "Spanish first edition"], "average": "6.15118", "name": "Star Munchkin", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Take That", "Trading", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["106498", "54435", "98956", "38891", "136857", "44805", "88665", "100422", "11058", "136914", "126425", "39392", "14580", "134690", "130194", "187049", "226171", "39393", "134725", "130826", "134691", "41034", "24733", "84870", "62387", "153943", "146658", "146657", "146659", "69436", "153284", "165684", "176441", "86356", "10686", "173386", "181274", "80570", "134692"], "usersrated": "3717", "boardgameaccessory": ["Munchkin: Blank Cards", "Star Munchkin: Accessory Pack"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Munchkin"]}}
