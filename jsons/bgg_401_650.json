Players must bid 1 - 3 three cards on each of these categories. Once all three factors have been determined, players tally the value of the cards they played during this bidding process. The player who played the least value receives 4 (or 5, depending upon the number of players) victory points, with each other player receiving less points depending upon their total. Then, players must discard three of the cards they used in the bidding process, with the remaining cards being returned to their hands. This is usually a tough choice as often the conditions in effect for a particular hand turn out to be different than what you had hoped. This means that many of the cards you played may no longer be useful to you; indeed, they may be a detriment. So, deciding on which cards to keep and which to discard can be tough.<br/><br/>After this procedure is complete, A standard trick-taking game ensues. Points, however, are rewarded based on whether the goal was to take the most or fewest tricks. The player finishing with the most (or fewest, depending upon which goal was in force) receives 8 points (or 10 of playing with 5 players), the next player gets 6 points and so on down to 2 points.

Cards come in four basic suits plus a special gray &quot;political power&quot; suit. The cards have values from 5 - 50, with the most cards in the middle of the range. In your turn, you challenge an opponent to a duel in one of the suits. You play a card in any suit (not necessarily the one you are challenging in) , then your opponent plays a card in the same suit. Players can alternately withdraw, or keep going. You then play a different suit - in the same manner, adding up your total score. The suit you challenged in counts double. If the defender withdraws, the challenger places a base (i.e. scores a point) on the defender. If the challenger withdraws, he just finishes his turn without scoring. However, the loser forfeits all cards played (redrawing, but perhaps taking poorer cards), and the winner holds his played cards, and takes the loser's cards into a pool which can score points.<br/><br/>If no one withdraws after all four suits have been played, players may add gray cards in an attempt to take the lead.

Players take on the role of biplane pilots and tail gunners dog fighting their way through the gray skies of Europe during the war to end all wars. The game is visually appealing and, like many miniatures games, it was easy to project myself into the scenario. The game is played using 1/72 miniature aircraft mounted on radio antennae with a clear acrylic hex base to hold the whole thing upright. The game board is an aerial view of a WWI battlefield marked off in large hexes.<br/><br/>Pilots and gunners plot out three moves at a time. Each move the pilot chooses from one of eight maneuvers - straight ahead, straight ahead fast, left slip, right slip, right, left, hard right, stall, and Immelman. The slips allow the player to retain their current orientation but slide one hex to the right or left. Ahead fast allows the plane to move two hexes. Ahead, left, right, and hard right allow the plane to change orientation and move one hex in that new direction. An Immelman allows the plane to move forward one hex but completely reverse orientation.

In an interview designer Klaus Teuber stated &quot;As you know there are moments when you close a book really sad that it's over. After finishing the last page, you often feel like you've lost a friend -- to be somewhat melodramatic. So I was looking for a way to keep the book alive a little longer. Creating a game seemed the perfect solution. In this game, I was looking for a way to make riddles, to experiment with shapes and to let the players express their own creativity with clay.&quot;<br/><br/>The game starts with players using modeling clay to make objects that can be guessed by the other players. Players then take turns to move around the board either by rolling a die or spending gems to choose their move. The spaces landed on determine actions. Either the other players receive victory points, or you can ask a letter of an object (What's the fifth letter of that thing?), or you can ask general questions or make a single guess until you get a NO answer. Players also have three curse stones that they can throw down twice in the game and make a guess.<br/><br/>You make a guess by writing the word down and passing it to the owner, who answers YES or NO. If you guess right, you stick an arrow in the object and score points (5pts if you're first, 3pts for second correct guess). In addition, and this matters, the object owner can either gain points or lose points, depending on the total arrows sticking at the time. So if you make your object too easy, or too hard, you lose points, but if you get it just right, you gain. Plus, at the game end, objects lacking arrows also lose their owners points.<br/><br/>Your objects must each represent a single specific word, which you note down in secret. Trying to think of two or three things that people will guess, but not too easily, is really tricky and makes Barbarossa a fun game. Hopefully the new edition has a better rules set, as players might get puzzled by the variety of actions.<br/><br/>A later-developed game with similarities to Barbarossa is Cluzzle.<br/><br/>Re-published by Kosmos / Rio Grande 2001.<br/><br/>Republished by Mayfair Games in 2005, in an edition for a maximum of 4 players in a smaller-sized box.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"170226": "Alga Swedish edition 1990"}, "average": "6.3996", "name": "Barbarossa", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "1252", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"7373": "Play Dough/Clay Games"}}, "551": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic21060.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"88827": "Battle Cry: 150th Civil War Anniversary Edition"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"25": {"name": "Richard Borg"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2000", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"25": "Richard Borg"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4871": {"name": "Avalon Hill Games, Inc."}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic21060_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1048": {"name": "American Civil War"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"21570": "2000 Charles S.

This game is regarded as one of the highlights of that group.  The object of the game is to deliver as many people to their destinations as you can.  To accomplish this, players place route markers on the board to connect passengers to their destinations.  However, the destination types (work, bar, home) vary from turn to turn, so you can follow certain passengers as they make their way through the daily grind.<br/><br/>Players may buy more buses (they start off with one), build onto their bus route, bring new passengers to the city (via the trains), expand the city by adding more buildings, and run their buses. There is another option, the clock, but more on that later. The action board has one other clever feature. On some actions, route expansion and building, the first player to choose that action actually gets to execute the action last! Which leads to some interesting games of chicken and some painful decisions.<br/><br/>Buying more buses allows a player to carry one more passenger every time they run their buses - hence scoring, in the best case, one more point. Depending on how the city gets built, however, finding lots of passengers on the street can be tricky.<br/><br/>Bus routes extend from either end of a Settlers-style initial placement. Extensions are appended to either end. Routes may only run parallel if a route is completely blocked at both ends - seems pretty rare - so getting one end pinched off can be painful (but isn't it always?). All new passengers will arrive at one of two train stations so that is one concern when route building. One must also be careful to run by a nice mix of building types. And, when building, one must always have an eye towards spoiling other players' routes by placing a mix of building types at each of their intersection so that all of their passengers just walk! Finally, when carrying passengers, one wants to be careful to set up to carry the same passenger next turn.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"25074": "First Edition"}, "name": "Bus", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2007": "Pick-up and Deliver"}, "average": "6.86922", "usersrated": "668", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "age": "14"}, "553": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic918250.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"56342": "Chez Cthulhu"}, "is_expanded_by": {"67655": {"name": "Chez Cthulhu: Cthulhu Mask Promo Card"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1143": {"name": "Jon Darbro"}}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamecompilation": {"193337": "Chez Geek 1+2"}, "yearpublished": "1999", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"2247": "Alain H.

Players are also dealt five Life cards. The space directly in front of a player is their Room, where cards will be played during the course of the game. Slack can be represented using any available chit or counter, but every player begins with a Slack total of zero.<br/><br/>Players take turns as follows:<br/>-Draw Life cards until they have six in hand. (NOTE: Some Jobs vary this to five or seven cards.)<br/><br/>-Make &quot;variable&quot; rolls. Some Job cards have variable free time or income; their values for this turn are decided in this phase (rolling a 1-3 gives them   the first amount; rolling a 4-6 gives them the second). If there are any &quot;uninvited&quot; people in a player's room, he or she may also roll to &quot;get rid of&quot; them (by rolling a 4, 5 or 6) and either send each such person to another room or discard them (if they cannot be played to any other room).<br/><br/>-If any of the player's in-hand Life cards are green Person cards, they may roll to &quot;call&quot; the person to their room. A successful roll (3-6) gets them invited in; otherwise, they are discarded. Some people are &quot;uninvited&quot; (causing bad things to happen), and may be placed without a roll in any player's room. (See above for &quot;getting rid of&quot; these people.) Pet cards, such as Cats (which don't require a roll to enter a room) and Dogs (which may or may not need to be &quot;called&quot;) can also be played in this round.<br/><br/>-For each unit of free time the player's Job card gives them, they may perform one action (play a red Activity card) or go shopping (play any number of blue Thing cards). Some of these cards may have a cost; the total cost for all cards played in a round cannot exceed the income given to them by their Job card. (NOTE: Free Time and Income may be modified by certain Whenever cards played on the player by themselves or other players.)<br/><br/>-At the end of a turn, if a player has more than five cards in hand, the player must discard cards until they have five or fewer. If desired, players can discard all the way down to one card. (NOTE: It is also legal for a player to play ALL the cards in their hand and have NO cards at the end of a turn.)<br/><br/>-Additionally, some Life cards are orange &quot;Whenever&quot; cards which can be played at any time.<br/><br/>-Activity cards and Thing cards typically list a Slack value which is added to the player's Slack total, though some have random Slack totals and some have Slack totals which vary during the game. TV Activity cards and some Whenever cards can be used to cancel cards as they are being played, and some cause previously-played cards to be discarded. Some cards add or subtract Slack from every player's total, while others cause a player to change their Job card (and hence Slack goal).

Rarer still are the instances in which these games succeed in presenting a simulation of unparalleled realism in an easily comprehended and playable format. In UP FRONT, we have just such a game. Gone are the hexes and charts of conventional wargames; replaced by innovative and attractive game components which have distilled a wealth of technical data into one of the most playable, yet detail laden formats ever devised.<br/><br/>UP FRONT is a game of man-to-man infantry combat set in WWII Europe and is based loosely on the popular SQUAD LEADER game system. Players need not be familiar with any of the various SQUAD LEADER games or rules to play. The basic theory behind the design remains the same; only the mechanics of play differ. UP FRONT is a far simpler adaptation of SQUAD LEADER principles designed to a card game format. Yet, in many ways, the game is more realistic than its predecessor in that its inherent mechanics simulate the fear and confusion of the battlefield and the inability of leadership to assert itself far better than any tactical combat game yet published. There is no playing board; it has been replaced by Terrain cards which become the &ldquo;hexagons&rdquo; of the game as players maneuver their forces via Action cards over constantly changing terrain. The scale of the game is measured in terms of relative ranges between opposing forces, with most combat occurring within a scale distance of 500 meters during the course of player turns measured in varying seconds of actual time.<br/><br/>UP FRONT is a game player&rsquo;s game, rich in detail yet easily playable within the space of a lunch hour. However, it also contains engrossing Multi-Player and Campaign Game versions which could last a week or more. Like SQUAD LEADER, its famous predecessor, UP FRONT is an open-ended game capable of depicting endless Design-Your-Own variations of small unit actions between American, German and Russian combatants. Tanks, Assault Guns, Smoke, Anti-Tank Rifles, Demolition Charges, Pillboxes, Partisans, SS, Entrenchments, Anti-Tank Mines, Infantry Guns, Flamethrowers, Armoured Cars, Halftracks, Panzerfausts, Bazookas, Panzerschrecks, Wire, Ambushes, Radios, Artillery, Minefields, Mortars, Snipers, Starshells, Heroes, Prisoners and Fords are all accounted for. In fact, UP FRONT encompasses almost everything that the SQUAD LEADER game system has taken four gamettes to do, and does so in a far more playable format. The game can be summed up in four words: Innovation, playability, detail and realism. That&rsquo;s an unbeatable combination.<br/><br/><br/>UP FRONT is rated 4 on the Avalon Hill Complexity scale of 1 (easy) to 10 (difficult).<br/><br/>Recommended for two or more discriminating players of skill, ages 12 &amp; up.<br/><br/>Each game includes: <br/><br/>     162 full-colour, quality 2&frac14;&quot; &times; 3 &frac12;&quot; playing cards<br/>     120 full-colour 2&quot; &times; 2.6&quot; infantry cards<br/>     40 full-colour 2.3&quot; &times; 3.1&quot; AFV cards<br/>     304 double-faced .75&quot;, .6&quot;, and .5&quot; counters<br/>     12 scenarios with up to four variations of each<br/>     A plastic card tray<br/>     A 36-page rulebook containing Designer&rsquo;s Notes, Historical T, O &amp; E charts and Campaign Game Rosters.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"23901": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.84312", "name": "Up Front", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2018": "Campaign / Battle Card Driven"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "1896", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "587": {"boardgamedesigner": {"275": {"name": "Hartmut Witt"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Sumera", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2002": "Tile Placement"}, "yearpublished": "1999", "usersrated": "28", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1435_t.jpg", "average": "6.31071", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"174": {"name": "Wittspiel"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1435.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"111519": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "This abstract includes 120 wooden squares, twelve wooden houses and thirty-two human<br/>figures in four colors for a game which is simultaneously about competition and cooperation.<br/><br/>At the start there is a deserted, connected and fruitful land.

Players do not own any horse.  Rather, they each have three betting chips.  On a player's turn, she/he rolls a die and moves one of the five horses forward based on the result of the roll.  The race track pictured on the board has two lanes.  These lanes are used by the player to keep track of which horses have been moved in the current turn. At the start of a turn all of the horses shall be in the same lane. Then as a player moves the horses forward, he/she also moves them to the other lane. The player continues until they've rolled five times and moved each horse once.  The lane from where the horses started the turn will be empty.<br/><br/>That's simple enough.  But before each turn, players are allowed to place a bet on a horse (starting with the rolling player).  After a person places a bet (e.g. &quot;I'll back the green horse&quot;) the next player can choose to or not to place a bet.  This continues until all players decline to place a betting chip.  Then the player starts rolling and moving horses.<br/><br/>Eventually, three horses will cross the finish line and will pay out for win, place, or show positions.  The player who first placed a bet on the winning horse claims the greatest payoff.  Payoffs diminish the longer a player waited to support a horse (e.g. the second person to bet on the horse that ultimately wins pays less than the first player to back the second-place horse).<br/><br/>The constant wait-and-see is agonizing.

Thus, you and everyone else starts with some information about what's not missing.<br/><br/>A second deck contains 54 search cards, each showing one or two elements, such as diamonds, pairs, blue opals, red pearls, or an element of your choice. Each player receives four face-up search cards; on a turn, you choose one of those cards and ask an opponent how many gem cards they have of the type shown. If you ask for, say, pairs, the player must tell you how many pairs they hold but not which specific pairs; if you ask for something more specific, say, red diamonds, the player reveals to everyone how many such cards she holds while you get to look at them in secret.<br/><br/>Players track information on a score pad. You can guess the hidden gem at any time, or on your turn you can ask any one question regardless of which search cards you have, then immediately make a guess by marking your sheet and checking the hidden gem card.

The higher card wins and that player sets that card aside scoring the number of pips on it. The loser retains his/her played card. However, if the higher card is more than twice the lower card then it's the lower card that is placed aside and scored. So the 13 will beat the 10 but lose to the 6. Play continues until one player is left with but a single card. Points are then scored and, here's the clever bit, players swap hands and do it again. This ensures that each game is exactly fair as both players will have equal opportunity to play a strong/weak hand. After these two rounds the points are totaled and a winner declared.

The box rates the game for 2-6, the rules rate it for 2-4, and the body of the rules refer to a maximum of five players. It is recommended that players stay within the 2-4 range, where 3 players seems ideal, otherwise the benefits of the honor cards (see below) are far too strong.<br/><br/>Players start with seven strength, two gold, and no cards. On each turn a player can flip one, two, or three cards from the deck, keeping one of them and discarding the rest. All of a player&rsquo;s cards are kept face-up, stacked by type so everyone can see them.<br/><br/>Players win by knocking out all opponents or having the highest score after three passes through the deck. Most of the cards are distributed among five color-coded types: strength, force, gold, magic, and honor. The player with the most cards of each type gains an advantage, usually at the start of his turn. The simplest of these increase a player&rsquo;s strength or gold, or decrease other players&rsquo; strength. The leader in magic can trade any of his cards for any card from the discard pile, or sacrifice any one of his own cards to destroy an opponent&rsquo;s card.<br/><br/>Honor works differently. Shuffled into the deck are four &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Favor&rdquo; cards. When one of these is turned up, the player with the most honor gets two gold, two strength, or the top card from the deck. Misfortune cards are the dark side of the same coin, forcing loss of gold, strength, or cards from all players. Many cards bear a rainbow icon, however, and the player showing the most rainbows at the top of their stacks is protected from Misfortune.<br/><br/>A player can spend gold at the end of his turn to buy another card from the deck, decrease an opponent&rsquo;s strength, or trade cards with an opponent. A player losing his last strength is knocked out of the game. Anyone who survives to the third appearance of the Long Live the King card (which triggers a reshuffle) scores a point for each magic card, strength, and gold they have.

That was a time when there were no TV million$, no real passing game as they played with a squashed medicine ball, shoulder padding was a sturdy arrant jumper, helmets were strictly optional and you were expected to play on both offense and defense.<br/><br/>The game features such notable institutions as the Pottsville Maroons, the Dayton Triangles and the Frankford Yellowjackets, and mega stars like Red Grange, George Halas, Jim Thorpe and Paul Robeson.<br/>        <br/>The game works on the old system of pulling a team together, playing a series of games, whacking down some event cards and trying to obtain the best record to win the league.<br/><br/>At the start of the game you are handed some event cards, a league franchise, a team name and, unless you are very unlucky, a handful of star players. You also get some money.   Your core players, the poor faceless grunts in the trenches, are abstracted into a simple team rating and a total salary bill (excellent idea) but the star players, the backs and ends, are each given their own individual card. As team manager, it is your job to balance the huge benefits of having these talented individuals on your staff with the interestingly high salaries they demand for performance.<br/><br/>The three key areas of offense, defense and special teams can all be enhanced by the star cards.<br/><br/>In addition to the player-controlled teams, who will usually play each other twice, the game also supplies a range of 'autopilot' opponents. There are league teams who are often as good, or even better, than the players' lineups and also sandlot teams.<br/><br/>Event cards add a lot to almost any the game. They can be played either before your weekly scheduled game or during the game itself. Their effects are wide ranging; from new gadget plays that can give you an extra dice on offense, to sponsorship deals that enable you to sell out to local government for big money. There are college players, fan loyalty, rain insurance, scams, scandals, intrigue and even subtle stuff like players' agents, loyalty and defections.<br/><br/>Once you have played the game, you work out the gate receipts, which are divided between the home team and the visitors based on a pre-agreed percentage split. There are variables such as number of star players on show, rain, home opener, whether you are playing a winning team, etc. As it is more profitable to be at home (no travel expenses) and to play the winning teams with the most star players, each team has an inherent draw factor - remember this is pre-TV - and can negotiate and earn high income accordingly. Want to play the top rated Canton Bulldogs (8-0-2, three star players) at home? You are going to have to offer their boss a healthy enticement to come to Oolong and perform against your 0-5 Indians, just to earn some money to pay off your overdraft.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, having pocketed your share of the take, you must pay all the players their salaries and if you can't meet the payroll, you will start to lose staff. They may stay on out of the goodness of their hearts, but you also need to apply to the league for a stay of financial execution and avoid bankruptcy. All this links into the league structure. If you have any sort of claim against your opponent you may appeal and have your rival reprimanded or fined, and always at the back of your mind is simply surviving game to game. You must maintain a winning record, you need to find new players to satisfy the butcher's bill of game injuries and, if you survive all that and play nine games well, you'll get a shot at the league title. Interestingly, the game can be won by other means than just having the best record. The team with the most money also gets a point, and a winning season will accrue another. It is unlikely that with a title win you'll lose, but there will be teams close on your tail.<br/><br/>"}, "612": {"boardgamedesigner": {"301": {"name": "Torsten Marold"}}, "average": "5.95617", "poll": {}, "name": "Kippit", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1999", "usersrated": "141", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3539797_t.png", "boardgameartist": {"94857": "Arrnold Reisse"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1280": {"name": "FoxMind"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3539797.png", "boardgameversion": {"90185": "FoxMind English/French/German edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "A game of balance.

However, if the stack collapses before the seesaw tips, then you get stuck with any blocks that fall onto the table.<br/><br/>In either case, any blocks that stay on the seesaw are left there to complicate future turns.<br/><br/>Steady hands and a little knowledge of physics helps.<br/><br/>"}, "613": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1078085.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"24": {"name": "Alex Randolph"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1978", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "8", "boardgamepublisher": {"152": {"name": "Lakeside"}}, "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1078085_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "description": "This game is one of a series of 2 player strategy games by Lakeside from the 1970's, also including Blockade, Trespass, and Isolation.

Cards are numbered 1-37 and are found in three colors, red (comprising largely the highest numbers), blue (mostly in the middle) and yellow (mostly the lowest numbers) with colors being analogous to the suit in a standard deck.  There is one neutral card, the 19, that sets the &quot;price of the bottle.&quot;<br/><br/>The entire deck is dealt to the three or four players in the game and then, similarly to hearts, cards are exchanged and a card is played to the bottle.  As per the usual elements of a trick taking game, players must follow suit if possible with high card taking the trick (regardless of suit).  The unique feature about this game however is how trump is determined.  Any card of value lower than the current price of the bottle (starting with 19) is considered &quot;trump&quot; and will win the trick.  If multiple cards are less than the current bottle price, the card valued closest to the current price (so highest card below the bottle) takes the trick AND THE BOTTLE, the bottle price is adjusted by the player taking the card that represents the current bottle price and replacing it with the card they used to win the trick.  Thus the price of the bottle will decrease with each trump card played, and the bottle is increasingly harder to win/purchase.  Ownership of the bottle will pass from player to player and the number of possible trump cards will decrease both as a factor of cards being played and cards being skipped as the bottle price descends.  One player will be stuck with the bottle at the end of a hand (when players have played all the cards in their hands).<br/><br/>Cards have point values from 1-6 (not directly based on numerical value), at the end of the hand players will score points for the cards of tricks they've won, except the player who holds the bottle who will score NEGATIVE points for all the cards played to the bottle at the beginning, scoring nothing for the cards they won during the hand.

Also included are all official variants and optional rules.  Available now for download in the 'Files' section of this page.  This effort embraced the official work almost exclusively.  The 4th Edition will attempt to fix some of the issues in the official work.<br/><br/><br/>4th Edition Game Available Now<br/><br/>The Unofficial Mapboard, in support of the comprehensive rulebook and titled the 4th Edition Mapboard, is now available. 1st Edition Mapboard was the initial release.  Some suggestions for updates were made so that is considered the 2nd Edition (for those who used whiteout on the 4th river of Kiev).  The brand new map was the 3rd Edition.  The 4.0 version, where unofficial work is involved, is available now on the VASSAL web site as part of the module and as a PDF for printing.<br/><br/>The 4th Edition Rulebook is specific to the 4th Edition Mapboard and has significant unofficial work to fix various issues.  The primary focus of the 4th Edition was the new map and the Grand Campaign Game.<br/><br/><br/>The Sequel to War and Peace<br/><br/>The sequel is in progress, and can be preordered at;<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href='http://ossgamescart.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp' rel='nofollow'>http://ossgamescart.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp</a>;products_id=90<br/><br/>Also visit ConsimWorld for 'Struggle Between England and France, The'<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"25128": "Avalon Hill edition"}, "name": "War and Peace", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "939", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "average": "6.65118"}, "627": {"boardgamedesigner": {"484": {"name": "Ted Raicer"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Royal Tank Corps", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2021": "Area-Impulse"}, "yearpublished": "2000", "usersrated": "62", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3023_t.jpg", "average": "6.51855", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3133": {"name": "Kokusai-Tsushin Co., Ltd.

These entertaining contests require strategy, intuition, and nerve to determine who survives and who doesn't.<br/>   <br/>This is an auction bidding game. Each round, the lead off player flips over a card from the deck which will then be auctioned off. There are also Hidden Resource cards in the deck. When one comes up, players bid for the next card in the deck without knowing what it is!  Each player has 6 bid markers: 3 Pass, 2 Stop, and 1 Strike. Each round of each auction, a player must place one of these markers face down. The first round, the markers are placed in the '5 position'. This means if the auction is stopped at this position, the winner pays 5 for the item. If no one stops the auction, players place a marker in the '4 position'. Once again, if the auction is stopped, the winner pays 4 for the item. These rounds continue until the auction is stopped, or until the auction moved to the last '0 position'. Once the auction for that item is complete, the deck passes to the next player. Each time the deck comes to a player, he collects income as listed on each item card he owns. He may then choose to place an item sold back to the bank up for auction, or draw one from the deck to be auctioned. One thing that makes Shipwrecked stand out from other auction games is that you can't 'not bid'.

At the start of the game, each player starts off in a lifeboat.  They have to steal a pirate ship (based on the result of a dice roll), otherwise, they are stuck in the lifeboat and have to skip their turn.  When they have a ship, players draw Playing Cards into their hand.  These cards offer maps for treasures, events to modify a pirate's guns and crews, and other ways to bend the rules of the game.<br/><br/>A pirate's score is reflected by his treasure, which comes from the wealth-laden ships, loot, and hostages in the form of Treasure Cards.  These cards are drawn from their deck when a pirate plays a map in hand, or by making a successful &quot;Sail Ho!&quot; dice roll during their turn.  Pirates can bury their treasure to keep them safe, although they have to dig it up for it to be counted as score.<br/><br/>Some Treasure Cards, however, are perils in the forms of deadly pirates (such as Blackbeard) and naval warships.  Players can play perils on fellow pirates, forcing them to engage in combat.  Players can also engage other players in battle as well during a successful &quot;Sail Ho!&quot; dice roll if they choose to do so instead of drawing Treasure Cards.  Such battles are resolved by comparing dice rolls, which are added to the player's number of guns or crew.  The loser's ship is sunk and the player has to start his or her subsequent turns in a lifeboat.  The winner also takes the loser's unburied treasure.<br/><br/>The game ends when a pirate has 3,000 or more pieces of eight worth of unburied treasure and makes a successful dice roll to &quot;Sail Home&quot;, thus becoming the winner.<br/><br/>"}, "647": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1533": {"name": "Eric M.

The board is composed of hexes a la Settlers of Catan. These hexes are dealt out to the players who may look at them and then deploy them face down one at a time. The players then receive an initial allotment of money. They may spend this money to purchase units for the initial planet-fall. Any money that isn't spent is doubled. Opening strategies are based on buying enough infantry to hold any cities that you can know of (from the hexes dealt) and deploying those infantry to guard those cities.<br/><br/>There are also several other components. First, is the tension track. This is essentially a turn marker. Once the tension track is exhausted the game ends. There are also a few off-world locations that provide special bonuses. Military units also make use of the transit and orbit boards. Units in &quot;transit&quot; are moved to &quot;orbit&quot;. Units in &quot;orbit&quot; can be deployed to the board.

Changes between Stimmt So! to Alhambra: The Card Game include:<br/>1) The initial money rules from Alhambra are used.<br/>2) The 2 player variant rules from Alhambra are used.<br/><br/>Stimmt So! A description of this version:<br/>Using mechanics similar to Union Pacific or its predecessor, Airlines, this game is about acquiring stock interests in the various aspects of a large corporation.  There are six <br/>different types of stock, which will reward the majority and sometimes the minority stockholders throughout the game.  Stock is made available by drawing cards on a four-card queue.  Each of the positions on the queue is a different stock market, which means there are four different currencies (Dollar, Euro, Ruble, Yen).  The currency cards are drawn from another queue on the same board.  A turn is quite simple - either take one of the four available currency cards or use some of your currency cards to purchase one of the available stocks.  If you pay more than the amount indicated on the stock card, the excess is lost.  However, if you purchase the stock for the exact printed price, then you can buy another stock, and so on.  After two randomly distributed payouts, the game ends with a final payout with the final stock card.  The player with the highest payout point total is the winner.<br/><br/>Al Capone  A description of this version:<br/>Using Influence cards, you collect Trade cards from different areas of town under the Mafia control, giving you control over the Distillery, the Chinese Laundry, the Betting Shop, etc. If you spend the exact amount of Influence required, you get another turn, and so on. Scoring occurs randomly twice during the game and at the end. When the first scoring occurs, only the majority holder in each Trade scores. When the second scoring occurs, the first and second majority holders score, and at the final scoring, the first three majority holders score. Ties are split accordingly.<br/><br/>Other versions/re-themes:<br/>Alhambra Bonn card game is Alhambra the card game with the Bonn theme. Originally as a limited run for Bonn, Germany and surrounding areas. There is also a Alhambra New York card game which is currently out of print, as well as an Alhambra Nederland card game. The re-themes are collectors items that people like to collect.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"71137": "db-Spiele German First Edition"}, "average": "6.44943", "name": "Alhambra: The Card Game", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "10", "usersrated": "692", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"3431": "Alhambra"}}, "432": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2602138.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"31503": "Slide 5"}, "is_expanded_by": {"20030": {"name": "6 nimmt!

Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.<br/><br/>To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.<br/><br/>In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.)

Using logic, players deduce which way the gates will move when they drop their marble, and try to make a move that results in the most marbles making it to the bottom of the game (or that blocks a potentially good move by their opponent).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"91302": "Lakeside transparent edition"}, "name": "Avalanche", "playingtime": "30", "average": "5.7465", "usersrated": "200", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5902": "Marble Games"}}, "449": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic200928.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"310": {"name": "Nik Sewell"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1991", "maxplayers": "8", "age": "7", "boardgamepublisher": {"28": {"name": "Parker Brothers"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic200928_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"2650": {"name": "Aviation / Flight"}}, "description": "This is a light game -- lighter than air, one might even say -- in which each player starts the game with a card assigning a secret interest in three different balloons.

At the beginning of the game, however, players don't know which mission they must fulfill!<br/><br/>In the standard four-player game, each player guides one of four secret agents. The four characters are allied in pairs: Lord Fiddlebottom and Colonel Bubble are always partnered against Agent X and Madame Zsa Zsa. Each of the four agents is represented by one of four different figures, with different builds: tall, short, fat, thin. Only one of them represents the actual character controlled by a player. The other three figures represent spies which are friendly to him and that are trying to confuse the opposition.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player shakes the Phantom of Prophecy randomizer to determine his three available actions, e.g., moving on a land route or a sea route. The player moves his figures, trying to reach spaces already occupied by the other players' figures or the Ambassador. When figures are in the same space, the current player gets the right to &quot;ask questions&quot; and inspect some of the cards of that player. By deduction and a logical process of elimination, he can draw conclusions as to the identity and intentions of the other players.<br/><br/>The first goal of every agent is to discover which of the other players is his partner. This partner has the other half of the &quot;code&quot; indicating his secret mission. After discovering (or thinking he has discovered) the real identity of the other players, an agent must trade his secret mission card with his ally. This will reveal the final mission and what must be done to complete it. If either agent on a team completes the mission, both he and his partner win the game.<br/><br/>There is another character with an important role in the game: the Ambassador. He can be used to get clearer information about the other characters. Everyone wants to meet him because he is well-informed and can be useful to accomplish your purposes, but he can also help your rivals, so do everything you can to keep him far from them.<br/><br/>The 2013 version of Inkognito from Ares Games raises the maximum player count to five by allowing someone to play the Ambassador and move it during his turn. He can still gather clues when the other players question the Ambassador during their turn, and the other players can still gather clues from him. The goal of the Ambassador's player is to know everything about the other characters, guessing their identities and builds. If the Ambassador achieves &quot;perfect knowledge&quot; before a team accomplishes its secret missions, he wins the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"215007": "Ares Games English edition 2013"}, "average": "6.58943", "name": "Inkognito", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2019": "Partnerships"}, "age": "10", "usersrated": "2407", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"17740": "Cities: Venice"}}, "467": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic248734.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"10": {"name": "Uwe Rosenberg"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1997", "maxplayers": "7", "boardgameartist": {"12024": "Bj\u00f6rn Pertoft"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"8": {"name": "AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic248734_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "This is an expansion for the Bohnanza card game.

You can buy &quot;special flights&quot; that help you get to places without the luck of the dice.<br/><br/>The most characteristic part of the game comes in the &quot;issues&quot;. Each player picks a politician with his own profile on how he stands on various issues. Then either through choice or chance cards, issues become &quot;active&quot;. As long as the issue is active, politicians with a relevant stand will have bonuses or penalties when he visits certain states. The game strongly encourages role playing.<br/><br/>The climax of the game comes at the end, as you go down each state to see who has the most votes, thereby winning that state's delegates. There is a smart balloting system, in which the lowest scoring player drops out, giving his states' votes to the next strongest in each state.

Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points.

On any given turn, each of your military units has limited options: they can move into an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in an attack on an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in defending an adjoining territory, or hold their position. Players instruct each of their units by writing a set of &quot;orders.&quot; The outcome of each turn is determined by the rules of the game. There are no dice rolls or other elements of chance.

You get a sloping rack in the shape of a dragon tail and at the start of the game pick the order for your wind stones on your rack, putting one stone underneath your own dragon at its starting position.<br/><br/>On your turn, you draw the bottom stone from your rack, place it (in the wind direction indicated) next to a dragon on the board, your dragon or another player's, and move the dragon onto your stone.  The stone the dragon had been standing on goes to the top of your rack, to be used again when it rolls down eventually to the bottom.<br/><br/>You make three moves per turn and try to put the other dragons into tough situations while making progress with your own.  So you generally want to play a North stone to move somebody else and the S, SO, and SW stones for your own dragon -- but there are blocks and corners, so this won't always be possible.<br/><br/>The main strategic tip is to try to move the dragons that have been left standing on stones with southward movement so as to get the S stones onto your own rack.

The game board shows a top-down view of the temple, showing a path through the temple off which are many niches holding the treasures. The pathway has stepping stones marked with a variety of symbols, one in front of each. To open the niche you must have the right symbol. To move around, you must spend footprint tiles. To obtain these, the player must reveal 2 supply tiles, keeps one and auctions the other. Players bid with anything they have, tiles, coins, cards.<br/><br/>Sounds confusing? It is. You must win auctions to get the stuff you need to win more auctions and move and open niches and collect treasures to score points to win the game.  It might take a player a while to figure the true value of all of the items and how it all fits together, but once a player has the idea, the game really works.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"102344": "First edition"}, "age": "10", "name": "Eschnapur", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "average": "5.72098", "usersrated": "195", "boardgamefamily": {"9470": "Asian Theme"}}, "511": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic223025.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"20303": {"name": "Silverton: New Mexico Expansion"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"238": {"name": "Dori Smith"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1991", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"27884": "Ted Rose"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"10": {"name": "Mayfair Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "180", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic223025_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": {"1055": {"name": "American West"}}, "description": "Game description by the publisher (2nd Ed.)<br/>Set in the historic mining areas of Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah, Silverton is a game of railroading, mining, and commodity market manipulation.<br/><br/>Use your surveyor to plot your railroads and your prospector to find your mines.
