There is more world information, tips on how to use the time-line and World Books, rewrites on O.C.C.s, and in some cases, expansions of and more details on O.C.C.s such as the Headhunter, Mercenaries, the Techno-Wizard and Shifter, as well as a few new O.C.C.s. Our goal was to make Rifts more exciting and compelling than ever, while at the same time making the rules better organized, clearer and easier to use. The wonder and infinite possibilities of Rifts all brought to pulse-pounding life like never before. Of course, there are a few fun changes and additions, but nothing so dramatic as to make the 40+ available sourcebooks obsolete.<br/><br/><br/>     Approximately 30 unique Occupational and Racial Character Classes, including Cyber-Knights, cyborgs, Glitter Boys, Psi-Stalkers, Dog Boys (mutant humanoid dogs), Juicers, Crazies, Techno-Wizards, Ley Line Walkers, Mystics, Shifters, Elemental Fusionists, Mind Melters, and many others.<br/>     Supernatural and magical creatures, like dragons, available as player characters, others are horrifying menaces from the Rifts.<br/>     Bionics and cybernetics offer a vast range of mechanical augmentation, meanwhile chemical enhancement (Juicers) and brain implants (Crazies) can turn a human into a superman, though with tragic results.<br/>     Psychic powers are the source of the Burster, Mind Melter and Mystic&rsquo;s abilities.<br/>     Strange forms of magic are at the command of characters like the Ley Line Walker, Shifter, Elemental Fusionist, Rifter and Techno-Wizard (who combines magic and technology).<br/>     Super-technology with Mega-Damage body armor, energy weapons, rail guns, power armor, and human augmentation.<br/>     The Coalition States.

In fact, the ideas for the Mindwerks complex, The Angel of Death, new M.O.M. implants, psynetics, gene-splicers and the evil Millennium Tree were the source of my original inspiration for doing Triax and The NGR in the first place. It was just that I had too many fun and exciting ideas to squeeze into any one book. Add Mister Long's designs for bots, borgs and vehicles and it was a hopeless situation. So, at the very onset of writing Rifts Triax &amp; The NGR, I decided to do two or three books dealing with the technology, conflicts, people and places of Germany and Poland.

It is designed around a rules system that allows Players to create customizable characters that are life-like and unique and build them into powerful beings of their own imagination and crafting. In combat, Players must use strategy and cunning to overcome their foes - not just dice rolls - and it also allows experienced Players to pull off combination maneuvres that will utterly devastate their opponents.<br/>Even weak, low experience characters will be able to take on powerful adversaries provided that the Players are masters of the Deathstalkers system of combat and use tactical teamwork! Deathstalkers rewards clever Players; not just those who get lucky with the dice.<br/><br/>Deathstalkers is set in a dark, mysterious, horror filled world that is teeming with ghastly creatures and horrific monsters. The lands have been elaborately brought to life, as described in the World Guide, and such things as monsters, beasts and Gods have all been detailed to bring you a full-fledged world of terror, suspense and fright. The rules and combat system have been seamlessly woven into the adventuring atmosphere to bring mature gamers the best action, adventure and treasure seeking excitement they could ever ask for.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>Characters are based on a race and a skill. You race (choice of seventeen different ones, plus some variations between subraces and genders) will determine what dice you may roll to determine you attributes. In addition, it will give you some special abilities.<br/>Your class will determine what skills you have access to, your combat bonuses and magical abilities, if any. In addition, there is an optional rule to determine a birth sign for each character, which will give some further bonuses.<br/><br/>The game features an elaborate combat system (the Strategic Combat System), and the book includes a big list of equipment and monsters.<br/><br/>"}, "44572": {"rpgartist": ["Tim Bradstreet", "D.

My Life with Master is a game about role-playing the servants or minions of an evil Master or Mistress.<br/><br/>The prototypical setting of the role-playing game is in an unspecified Central European country in the early 19th century.  Players in the game portray the Igor-like minions of an evil Master (or Mistress) who preys on the nearby Townsfolk.<br/><br/>Like most role-playing games, there is a Gamemaster (GM). In this case the GM plays the part of the Master. However, the GM and players together are supposed to &quot;design&quot; the Master, in terms of defining his &quot;Wants&quot;, &quot;Needs&quot;, &quot;Aspect&quot;, and &quot;Type&quot;.  These traits have no explicit game effect, but are used to define the desires and mannerisms of the Master and how he interacts with the Townsfolk and his minions. Masters have two game statistics, &quot;Fear&quot; (a measure of his power over minions) and &quot;Reason&quot; (how much minions and Townsfolk can resist the Master's control over them).<br/><br/>In contrast, the Master's minions, the characters portrayed by the players, are defined (in terms of game statistics) by their levels of &quot;Weariness&quot; and &quot;Self-loathing&quot;, and the connections of &quot;Love&quot; that they have (successfully or unsuccessfully) tried to make with the Townsfolk.  Self-loathing is a measure of the power that a minion has to intimidate the Townsfolk, while Weariness limits their abilities to complete their tasks.  Love allows minions to resist their Master and his demands on them.<br/><br/>Gameplay is generally resolved through a series of &quot;scenes&quot;.  A player describes what their minion is trying to do, be it carrying out their Master's wishes or trying to resist him, interacting with the Townsfolk, attempting an act of Love (which could result in increasing their &quot;Love&quot; trait, or increasing their &quot;Self-loathing&quot; if the attempt fails), etc. A series of dice rolls are used to determine success or failure, and then the scene is played out according to that outcome.<br/><br/>Unlike other role-playing games that may have long campaigns, My Life with Master games are typically designed to end after a small number of playing sessions.  As one reviewer stated, My Life with Master &quot;strives to tell a story, and stories have endings.&quot;  Usually, a game culminates with the death of the Master at the hands of one (or more) of his minions.  Sometimes, the Master dies because the Townsfolk are &quot;sick of his predations&quot; and &quot;storm his domicile -- pitchforks in hand and torches aflame&quot;.  Some or all of the players' characters might also meet their end in the hands of the Townsfolk, or the Master kills them as they try to resist his commands and suffer the consequences of their failure.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;My_Life_with_Master,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "44584": {"rpgartist": ["Clyde Caldwell", "Terry Dykstra", "Carol Heyer", "John Lakey", "Laura Lakey", "Glen Orbik", "Valerie Valusek"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing", "Fourth Printing", "MJSR7 - Le Manuel Complet du Barde", "Second Printing", "Third Printing", "WotC PDF version"], "rpgseries": ["PHBR - Player's Handbook Rules Supplement"], "name": "The Complete Bard's Handbook", "rpgdesigner": ["Blake Mobley"], "rpgproducer": ["Tim Beach", "Mike Breault", "Paul Hanchette", "Angelika Lokotz"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic514152.jpg", "usersrated": "47", "average": "6.36702", "rpgissuearticle": ["Anmeldelser"], "rpg": ["Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["TSR", "Wizards of the Coast"], "poll": [], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic514152_t.jpg", "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>Thief, musician, clown, actor, acrobat - just a partial list of the many twists on the bard class to be found i this book!

In 1790, President Washington, responding to outbreaks of violence between settlers and natives, ordered General Harmar to lead an expedition against the Indians. With an army of 1400, Harmar reached the native villages of Kekionga near present day Fort Wayne Indiana. The natives quickly and soundly routed his expedition. Washington, embarrassed by the poor showing of the U.S. army, appointed a new general the following year, the Governor of the territory, Arthur St. Clair. Charged with subduing the Indian menace, St. Clair&rsquo;s plan was to establish a series of forts, starting at Fort Washington, and ending in northern Ohio.<br/><br/>It was on a cold morning on November 4, 1791, when the U.S. Army met its&rsquo; greatest defeat. With the trained professional soldiers hunting down supplies and deserters, poor, desperate, inadequately equipped, untrained, tired, and hungry men, stood against the resolved native alliance. At dawn, the Indians surprised and routed the Kentucky Militia encamped just 300-yards in front of the army, the militia fled, and the natives surrounded St. Clair&rsquo;s main force with ease.<br/><br/>Led by Little Turtle of the Miami, Blue Jacket of the Shawnee, and Buckongahelas of the Delaware the native alliance utterly destroyed St. Clair&rsquo;s army in three quick hours. 600 soldiers were killed, while 250 were left wounded. Compounding this were the deaths of an additional 250 camp followers. The natives suffered extremely low casualties -- fewer than 60 slain or wounded. The Battle of the Wabash, known to many as St. Clair&rsquo;s Defeat, stands as one of the worst defeats of the U.S. Army in actions against the natives (65% of the entire United States Army destroyed).<br/><br/>Now, three years later, efforts are underway to build a new fort on the site of St. Clair's Defeat. Much to the surprise to everyone, this is easier said than done. Numerous problems plague the construction, and rumors of the British spurring the Native Tribes in actions against the United States are spreading. With no one to spare, President Washington is looking for answers.<br/><br/>What no one knows is that the Dead of Fort Recovery want their vengeance. Betrayed by the military, the soldiers were led to their death at the hands of a Indian uprising. In death, and unable to pass on, they now haunt the battlefield where they met their doom.<br/><br/>Set in the Northwestern Territories, The Defeated Dead is a new adventure designed for Colonial Gothic.

Replaces the Druid.<br/>- Shaper: Spellcasters who directly use the Spirit, the true divine essence of the world.<br/>- Spirit Adept: People soaked in the Spirit, resulting in increases abilities.<br/><br/>Characters in Dawnforge are supposed to shape the world, and become characters of legend. Each important deed that helps shape the world will gain a character a Legend Point, which will make him advance along a Legendary Path, gaining more special abilities, and eventually gaining access to the legendary classes: Dawn Archer, Fleetwind, Epic General, The Icon, Master Arcanist ahd The Unsuffering.<br/><br/>"}, "44764": {"rpgartist": ["Tim Bobko", "Tom O'Neill", "Brian Schomburg"], "rpgitemversion": ["Soft Cover"], "statistics": [], "name": "Star Wars Live-Action Adventures", "rpgdesigner": ["Scott Heinig", "Anthony Russo", "Peter Schweighofer", "Paul Sudlow"], "rpgproducer": ["Stephen Crane", "Peter Schweighofer", "Bill Smith", "George R.

It is set in the fantasy world of the miniature wargame Confrontation. The combats are supposed to be played with miniatures from that game.<br/><br/>The game is set in Cadwallon, the Free City. Cadwallon is a cosmopolitan city outside of the conflicts of Ragnarok. The city is divided in eleven fiefdoms, each with its own ruling family. The families are vassals of the elected Duke. In addition to the duke and the nobility, the guild also wields considerable power. Player characters are all part of another power in the City: The Free Leagues, heirs to the mercenaries that helped to found the city. They are bound to the Duke, but may also be hired by all other people to do jobs for them.<br/><br/>Characters have six base stats (attitudes), the value of which is determined by their race and culture. Furthermore, a character will belong to one or more classes (trades), which determine what his starting skills are, and what skills he can train. Finally, a character can have one or more distinctive features or feats, which give him special advantages.<br/><br/>Ability checks are made by rolling a number of D6s equal to your ability score. You then select the highest number rolled, add +1 for each additional time this number has been rolled, and then add the score of the corresponding attitude. If your total is greater than or equal to the difficulty of the test, you have succeeded.<br/><br/>Attitudes are more than simple stats, they reflect the behaviour of every character in the game (even NPC). If you are in the right attitude for specific actions, you may gain bonuses (free dice, for example).<br/><br/>There are also two different game modes: normal play and playing oppositions. Oppositions are a round-based game mode which may be used in combat and non-combat situations. Oppositions are the tactical part of the game where you have to use action and reaction pools that are split from the character's Potential.

Full-page black and white art was commissioned for this book, in particular from Charles Vess and Michael William Kaluta; Borgstrom's flash fiction, set in the game world, fills its large margins. This edition won the Origins Award for Best Graphic Presentation Book Format Product 2002 and the 2003 Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming. Guardians of Order ceased operations in 2006, with an announcement that they would attempt to find other publishers for their games.<br/><br/>Unlike most role-playing game systems, Nobilis does not use random elements in determining success in characters' actions. Instead, Nobilis uses a resource management system; players may spend Miracle Points to succeed at certain actions, but otherwise they rarely fail at what they set out to do. Instead of the action centering on whether or not the characters succeed, the emphasis is instead on the consequences of those actions. Since combat between Nobilis uses up Miracle Points very quickly and a Nobilis can easily defeat even great numbers of humans, social roleplaying is encouraged over combat. Though the characters may seem to have limitless power, in reality they must take into consideration both the outcome of every act and what other Powers or Imperators they may offend in the process.<br/><br/>Each character has 4 attributes: Aspect, which governs their ability to perform superhuman physical and mental acts; Domain, which covers their power over their estate; Realm, which determines how much power they have in their Chancel; and Spirit, which describes how much magical power the Nobilis has. Spirit creates the Auctoritas, a shield that protects them from the Miracles of other Powers. A character's Spirit also determines how many Anchors they may have. Each attribute has a number of Miracle Points associated with it.<br/><br/>The character creation system also makes Nobilis notable by giving players an unusual amount of control over the setting. In addition to creating their own characters a process which already allows for considerable customization the players create their Imperator and Chancel. Players receive a number of points to invest in their Chancel equal to the total amount they spent on their characters' Realm; they may use these to buy special attributes for their Chancel such as special technology or magical inhabitants. They do not receive any points for their Imperator, so they must take a corresponding drawback for every special attribute they wish their Imperator to have. Each Nobilis also has an Affiliation, which is a moral code they follow in order to regain Miracle Points, as well as character flaws called Limits and Restrictions. Much like their Affiliation, these allow the character to regain Miracle Points when they become an inconvenience.<br/><br/>"}, "44920": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jamie Chambers", "Christopher Coyle", "Don Perrin", "Margaret Weis"], "rpgitemversion": ["Dragonlance - Smocza Lanca: Opis \u015awiata", "Hard Cover", "PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Dragonlance Campaign Setting", "rpgartist": ["Dennis Cramer", "Jeff Easley", "Matt Faulkner", "Emily Fiegenschuh", "Lars Grant-West", "Rebecca Guay-Mitchell", "Heather Hudson", "Dennis Kauth", "Doug Kovacs", "Ginger Kubic", "John Lakey", "Laura Lakey", "Robert Lazzaretti", "David Martin (II)", "Matthew Mitchell", "Vinod Rams", "Darrell Riche", "Richard Sardinha", "Brian Snoddy", "Ron Spencer", "Matthew Stawicki"], "rpgproducer": ["Richard Baker", "Michele Carter", "Chas DeLong", "Erin Dorries", "Yasuyo Dunnett", "Martin Durham", "Mary Kirchoff", "Kim Mohan", "Cal Moore", "Dawn Murin", "Charles Ryan", "Bill Slavicsek", "Ed Stark", "Ray Vallese", "Valerie Vallese", "Anthony Valterra", "James Wyatt"], "usersrated": "53", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2944052.png", "rpgmechanic": ["Dice (Primarily d20)"], "rpgsetting": ["Dragonlance"], "average": "6.79434", "rpgissuearticle": ["Review Corner", "Review: Dragonlance Campaign Setting"], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (3.5 Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["ISA", "Wizards of the Coast"], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2944052_t.png", "description": "From the back of the book:<br/><br/>Sagas from the lands of Krynn are filled with valiant heroes destined to discover ancient secrets and vanquish terrible evils.

It&rsquo;s a fantasy role-playing game because you, the player, play the part of a fictional character in a fantastic world. (You get to play lots of characters if you&rsquo;re the GM.) The best analogy for this is given by Ron Edwards, a bad-ass of a game designer. He likens playing a role-playing game to being in a band: the members get together and decide what kind of music they want to play, one person (the GM) leads off, and the rest of the members add what they have to make something that is, hopefully, exactly what they wanted. Just like with playing music, one member of the band might find a cool riff that no one was expecting, and everyone else jumps on it. Donjon is like acid jam-rock. It&rsquo;s made to give players a lot of control: they can bust into guitar and drum solos whenever they wish. If something sounds groovy, then they can go with it.
