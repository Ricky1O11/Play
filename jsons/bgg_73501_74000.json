Initially the humans are weak- they cannot out run the Toracs and they certainly can't hope to fight them. Their only hope is to exploit the dim-witted intelligences of their converted brothers and sisters to evade total destruction. Only through surviving the Torac reactions to scavenge the ruins of their destroyed civilization can they hope to evict the invaders. They might find weapons, faster transportation, or even leftover superweapons from the 20th century in the form of nuclear devices. The best chance humanity has at removing the Torac (and winning the game) is to scavenge the ruins across the globe.<br/><br/>However, should the Torac annihilate the human presence on Earth, then their intention to convert Earth into their new homeworld will succeed unabated.

The starting player places one piece on either his/her territory, (the 13 squares in front of him/her) or on his/her opponent's territory (the 13 squares in front of the opponent). Both players then take turns placing pieces on the board. Once on the board, the pieces remain in the some place throughout the whole game. Towers are consisting of single pieces or several pieces piled on top of each other.<br/><br/><br/>THE TOWERS<br/><br/>The Towers are built with a minimum of one and a maximum of 4 pieces. Each piece in an individual Tower must have different sizes and colours. The Towers belong to the player whose territory they are built on. A player can for example choose to place a Tower on his/her opponent's territory to undermine the strength of the opponent's Towers: this Tower belongs to the opponent.<br/><br/><br/>THE CONFRONTATIONS<br/><br/>Towers confront each other when they are aligned, whether diagonally or frontally. There can be 7 frontal alignments and 6 diagonal ones. When one player has got 2 of his/her Towers on a same alignment, only the strongest one can enter a confrontation.<br/>If none of his/her opponent's Towers are aligned with his/hers, then there is no confrontation. An individual Tower can be involved in 2 different confrontations simultaneously, (one on a diagonal, the other on a frontal alignment). Both confrontations are then solved separately. In order to solve a conflict, the strengths of the Towers need to be assessed.<br/><br/><br/>HOW STRONG ARE THE TOWERS?<br/><br/>The strength of a Tower depends on the size of its highest piece. The pieces can have 5 different sizes, hence the strength of a Tower can vary from I to 5. Whatever its number of pieces, only the highest will account for the strength of a Tower. For example, a two-piece Tower can win over a four-piece Tower. There is however one exception to this rule: one-piece Towers will always lose to higher Towers. When the highest pieces of two confronting Towers are of equal strength, then the piece that comes immediately under it is assessed and so on until the confrontation is resolved.<br/><br/><br/>THE MONOLITHS (&quot;TRUMPETS&quot;)<br/><br/>Monoliths are used to visualize which of the 2 players (at any stage in the game) has got the upper hand. Each time a player wins a confrontation, he/she is given a Monolith to position on his/her side of the board, on the triangle corresponding to the alignment where the confrontation just took place.

Stalin is tired of his Stakhanovite labors in collectivizing agriculture, which isn't going so well, and wants to hear a story. The players' job is to tell him one, preferably without being summarily executed or sent to the Gulag.<br/><br/>It is played as a story-within-a-story: the actors must improvise a Russian fairy-tale for Stalin. Cards with story elements are distributed to the players, and they may play them at certain times to shape the story, with the actors improvising accordingly. In the exterior story, Stalin is going to order the death of at least one player, and all are desperately trying to ensure their own survival.<br/><br/>From the Introduction:<br/><br/>It is 1928, and Stalin has retreated to his personal chambers. In the world outside, his agricultural reforms have been unsuccessful, leading to a food crisis. He doesn't want to hear a word about that. The peasants are hiding the scarce food from the state collectors, and it is only at gunpoint that they are 'willing' to give it up. But Stalin doesn&rsquo;t want to hear a word about that either.<br/><br/>What he does want to hear is an old Russian folk tale of the kind his mother used to tell him. A tale of a poor boy going out into the world to slay a dragon and win the hand of a princess, as simple as that, nothing fancy. Especially nothing fancy.<br/><br/>To that end, Stalin has invited some of his closest companions to join him in his sitting room. Also present is a troupe of actors, ordered at a moment's notice to come and improvise a fairy tale for the pleasure of their great leader.<br/><br/>Everybody is on their toes. In these times of crisis, it is only too easy to displease Stalin. And if you displease Stalin, bad things happen to you. And so the actors play their tale, and the courtiers scheme for power and favour, and Stalin &ndash; capricious and inscrutable &ndash; decides over life and death.<br/><br/>"}, "73782": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing"], "statistics": [], "name": "Supervisors Kit", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic752400.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "average": "7", "rpgissuearticle": ["Open Box"], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Games Workshop Ltd."], "rpg": ["Golden Heroes"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic752400_t.jpg", "description": "User note: there are no credits present in the material.<br/><br/>From the screen:<br/><br/>About this Play Aid<br/><br/>This play aid augments Golden Heroes, the role-playing game of Superheroes.

First comes perception - vaguely, distorted, but unmistakably the awareness of an outer reality. Then ideas emerge, slowly, unfocused fragments appearing and winking out of existence again in a twisted resemblance of thought. Suddenly your sense of individuality, lost for what may have been a few seconds or an eternity, returns. You are a person. An I. You can think and you can feel, and you know that once you lived a real life. But who are you? And what? In the depths of your mind, you feel memories stirring, waiting to be awakened. The painful remembrances of a tragic past.<br/><br/>In Shades, every player takes control of a fictional character caught in a bizarre parody of life. Your body died, possibly long ago, but your mind merely retreated in a temporary unconsciousness. Now you have returned as a shade, a being without corporeal form, invisible to living human beings, but able to perceive the material world. You have little sense of self, and no idea of who you are, why you are dead, in what place you find yourself. But many memories lurk beneath the surface of your mind, waiting only for the most tiny of prods before vehemently bursting forth. These memories tell the tragic tale of your terrible fate, of the pain you suffered and inflicted; yet they may also contain the key to appeasement and redemption.<br/><br/>The stories of all the shades' lives are inextricably entwined. You were the authors of each other's destinies; your choices, conflicts and actions led to the unhappy, and perhaps untimely, end of all. You have inflicted so much pain upon each other that the wounds have never healed. They keep you tied to this existence. Can you resolve your differences, forgive each other, redeem your mistakes? Or is the impasse of hate and accusation to remain forever?<br/><br/><br/>When playing Shades, you and one or two others will try to construct a haunting tale of tragedy and forgiveness from scratch. You will take turns narrating a piece of the story from the point of view of your character, and you will try to make these pieces into a coherent whole. But the rules of the game don't make it all that easy for you to succeed: Shades is meant as a challenging cooperative game. The challenge is for you and the other player or players to together tell a coherent, emotional tale; and to do it just by telling the tale, without any prior agreement and without talking about the story during the game. Sounds hard? It's easier than you may think, once you've learned to trust the other players and be sensitive to their wishes and ideas.<br/><br/>And the rules of Shades are specifically designed to help you build up that trust and that sensitivity. They will help you get to know what kind of stories the other players like, and how they try to signal their ideas to you. They will help you to learn to relinquish control over the story to others when that is called for, without taking a posture of deference. Not only will you be telling great stories and having fun doing it, you may also become better friends.<br/><br/>"}, "73786": {"rpgartist": ["Joseph J.

A sequel, Battlefield: Bad Company 2 was released on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows on March 2, 2010.<br/><br/>Bad Company puts the player in a fictional war between the United States and the Russian Federation, where players will lead a squad of soldiers fighting Russians, MEC (Middle East Coalition) troops and Legionnaire mercenaries.<br/><br/>The game applies some new features to the franchise, including an environment that can be almost entirely destroyed, besides the very basic supports of buildings and certain metallic structures like antennas, and a single-player storyline. The single-player campaign and some multiplayer maps take place in Europe, the fictional Eastern European country of Serdaristan, and an unnamed fictional Middle Eastern country, in a city called Sadiz, which is located somewhere on the Caspian Sea.<br/><br/>In the game, players can hold one primary weapon which each has its own secondary, along with grenades and other picked up explosives and devices. The health system is different than most games. Damage to the player is shown by an out of 100 point system. Players need to heal by using a system of strategically (placed by a medic) health satchel which give health to those nearby. The environment is almost entirely destructible, but bullets cannot go through most walls. The ammunition system uses a bullet calculator, shown on the HUD, and players can endlessly repair vehicles with power tools unless they are completely destroyed. Airstrikes and Mortar Strikes can also be utilized.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Battlefield:_Bad_Company,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73811": {"videogame": ["Classic Text Adventure Masterpieces of Infocom", "The Lost Treasures of Infocom", "The Lost Treasures of Infocom (iOS)", "The Zork Anthology", "Zork Classics: Interactive Fiction", "The Zork Trilogy"], "poll": [], "name": "Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Amiga edition", "Amstrad CPC edition", "Apple II edition", "Atari 8-bit edition", "Atari ST edition", "Commodore 64 edition", "DOS edition", "Macintosh edition", "MSX edition", "North American CP/M edition", "TRS-80 edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic773822.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Zork"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "videogamefranchise": ["Zork"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Infocom"], "videogamegenre": ["Text Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "Amstrad CPC", "Apple II", "Atari 8-bit family", "Atari ST", "Commodore 64", "CP/M", "DOS", "Macintosh", "MSX", "TRS-80 Color Computer", "TRS-80 Model I/III"], "usersrated": "17", "average": "6.29412", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Commodore International Limited (Commodore)", "Infocom"], "videogamecompilation": ["Classic Text Adventure Masterpieces of Infocom", "The Lost Treasures of Infocom", "The Lost Treasures of Infocom (iOS)", "The Zork Anthology", "Zork Classics: Interactive Fiction", "The Zork Trilogy"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic773822_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz is an interactive fiction computer game published by Infocom in 1981.

It was developed by Nintendo EAD in Tokyo and released in 2004 in Japan and 2005 in Europe and North America. The original Gamecube version can be played with a normal Gamecube controller, but is designed to be played with the DK Bongos.<br/><br/>Although the game is basically a 2D Side-scrolling platform game, the game plays very different, since the DK Bongos are used for controlling the main character Donkey Kong. These DK Bongos were developed for use with the Donkey Kong Games, but in this game they are used to make Donkey Kong run, jump and perform attacks. By hitting the left drum or the right drum Donkey Kong moves in that direction. To make him jump, both drums have to be hit at the same time. Clapping hands, make Donkey Kong clap his hands, which can be used to defeat enemies. The goal of each level is to score as many 'Beats' as possible. To get those Beats the player has to collect bananas. By using combos the amount of beats received can increase greatly.<br/><br/>The game levels are divided into different kingdoms. A player has access to a number of kingdoms, and can unlock additional kingdoms, by scoring enough Beats. There are three levels in each kingdom. In each kingdom there is a boos to be beaten. The amount of health a player has is based on the amount of Beats collected. Not all kingdoms have unique bosses, some kingdoms have harder versions of previous encountered bosses. The player can always replay already finished levels to increase the score.<br/><br/>The game received many positive critics. The game was and still is unique and this was acknowledged by many reviewers. Most of them concluded the game was fun after getting use to the non-traditional control scheme. Apart from the novel controls, the game is considered a well designed platformer with interesting concepts. The game is playable by casual gamers, but also challenges more hardcore players to score as high as possible. A point of criticism often made was the rather short length of the game, as well as the reuse of bosses. The game has been released for the Wii as a 'New Play Control'-title. Instead of the DK Bongos that version uses the Wii Remote and the Nunchuck for controlling Donkey Kong. There are more small changes, some of which making the game a bit more like a traditional platformer.<br/><br/>"}, "73822": {"poll": [], "name": "Donkey Kong Barrel Blast", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["AU Wii edition", "BE, NL Wii edition", "English/European Wii edition", "JP Wii edition", "NA Wii edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1058283.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Animals", "Cute Fantasy"], "videogamegenre": ["Racing"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Paon"], "videogamefranchise": ["Donkey Kong"], "videogameplatform": ["Wii"], "usersrated": "1", "average": "6.5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Nintendo Co., Ltd."], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1058283_t.jpg", "description": "&quot; with user comments<br/><br/>Donkey Kong Barrel Blast, known in Europe and Australia as Donkey Kong Jet Race, in Japan as Donkey Kong Taru Jet Race (\u30c9\u30f3\u30ad\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30b0 \u305f\u308b\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9, lit.

Donkey Kong Jr. also makes a guest appearance in the game on some levels, helping his father hinder Mario's progress.

It was essentially an updated version of Donkey Kong '94, but the game had disappeared by the following year. It was replaced with the pre-rendered graphics and gameplay additions of Mario vs. Donkey Kong.

It can be used as a standard layout of a floor of the Synergon building. The Boss determines how many departments are located within the maze and also predetermines certain cubicles where useful items can be found. If the frenemy occupying a cubicle is Demoralized, the attacking employee inherits any items inside.<br/><br/>The second option is to use this map in a sort of turf war. Either The Boss controls an opposing department to compete with the Team of players, or the Team itself can compete in a PvP match to see who can control the most territory. To control a cubicle, an employee must be the only person in the cubicle and use the Triumphant Fist Pump ability (1AP). Triumphant Fist Pump counts as one of the three abilities usable in a single hour. The cubicle is then in that employee&rsquo;s control unless an opposing employee successfully uses Triumphant Fist Pump inside it.<br/><br/>The employee or Team who gains and retains control of a predetermined (by The Boss) number of cubicles wins.<br/><br/>Notes on using this map: Each square represents (roughly) a 3ft. x 3ft. area. More importantly, they represent the number of moves that can be taken each round if playing with movement restrictions. One square equals one move.<br/><br/>Cubicle walls are short enough that they can be jumped, instead of walking through the hallways. Hopping a cubicle wall does not have any movement penalties, however, jumping a cubicle wall incurs a penalty of 1d4 hours of Look Stupid. If the jump involves crossing a desk (the brown areas) on either side of the wall, the employee also receives 1d4 hours of Scrutinized. We can&rsquo;t have employees scrambling over company property all willy-nilly, after all.<br/><br/>Also note that computers are located in the corner of each cubicle for using computer-related abilities.<br/><br/>"}, "73853": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["HTML Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "SynergonRPG.com", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1221383.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Corporations", "Modern (Urban)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpg": ["Synergon"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1221383_t.jpg", "description": "From the Introductory Page:<br/><br/>Welcome to Synergon, your new corporate home and personal hell.

It is the first game of a trilogy.  A separate game entitled Crysis Warhead was released on September 12, 2008, and follows similar events as Crysis but from a different narrative perspective.  Crysis, Crysis Warhead and a multiplayer expansion called Crysis Wars were re-released as a compilation pack titled Crysis Maximum Edition on 5 May 2009. At the time Crysis was released, and years thereafter, it has been praised, and denigrated, for its milestones in graphical design (which corroborated with likewise high hardware requirements).<br/><br/>The game is based in a future where an ancient alien spacecraft has been discovered beneath the ground on an island near the coast of the East Philippines. The single-player campaign has the player assume the role of United States Delta Force operator Jake Dunn, referred to in-game by his call sign, Nomad. Nomad is armed with various futuristic weapons and equipment, most notably a &quot;Nano Muscle Suit&quot; which was inspired by a real-life military concept. In Crysis, the player fights both North Korean and extraterrestrial enemies, in various environments on and around a tropical island in the Pacific near Korea.<br/><br/>As with Crytek's previous game Far Cry, Crysis is an open-ended first-person shooter game with many ways to meet objectives.<br/><br/>The player controls a special forces soldier codenamed Nomad whose weapons can be customized without pausing the flow of time, for example changing firing modes, changing scopes or adding sound suppressors. The player is also capable of selecting various modes in Nomad's military prototype &quot;Nano Suit&quot; which draw power from the suit's energy. When the suit's energy is depleted, no modes can be used and the player is more vulnerable to damage before the suit recharges. One of four modes can be selected: Armour deflects damage and recharges the suit's energy faster; Strength allows stronger hand-to-hand combat, the ability to throw objects and enemies with deadly force, higher jumps, steadier aiming and reduced weapon recoil; Speed increases running and swimming speed, as well as other forms of motion; and Cloak renders Nomad almost completely invisible and suppresses movement noise.<br/><br/>The suit's integral mask has its own HUD, displaying typical data including a tactical map, health, current energy levels, and weapons information. The view is electronic in nature, shown in-game through things such as a booting readout and visual distortion during abnormal operation. A particularly useful utility is the binocular function, which allows the player to zoom in and electronically tag enemies and vehicles from afar, thereby tracking their movement on the tactical display.<br/><br/>The player can engage enemies in a variety of ways; using stealth or aggression, bullets or non-lethal tranquilizers, ranged rifles or short-range weaponry, and so on. Enemy soldiers employ tactical maneuvers and work as squads. AI soldiers will respond to noise caused by the player, including using signal flares to call for reinforcements. If the player has not been detected in the area, enemies will exhibit relaxed behaviour, but if aware of the player they will draw weapons and become combative.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Crysis,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>Microbadges:<br/><br/> Crysis Series fan<br/><br/>"}, "73885": {"rpgartist": ["Alea Publishing Group Studio", "Mark Hughey", "Paul Slinger"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "poll": [], "name": "Temple, Castle and Wilderlands", "rpgdesigner": ["Jarrod Camir\u00e9"], "rpgproducer": ["Tori Bergquist"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3257302.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Zodiac Gods Publishing"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["D100 Discoveries Series"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3257302_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>Introduction<br/>Welcome to the first book of D100 Discoveries Series, a great collection of encounter tables offered to you by Zodiac Gods Publishing.

The game is set in World War II Europe. The player commands a team of up to six elite soldiers on the Axis or Allied side, undertaking a variety of missions. An advanced game engine, the Silent Storm engine, was developed for the game and reused in several later titles. The game was followed by Silent Storm: Sentinels in 2004. A Gold edition containing both the original game and the expansion was released in Europe later that same year.<br/>Once the player begins a campaign, they may select a premade character or create their own to lead the team through the game. Once the introductory mission is complete, the player can access a base complete with a medical station, armoury, personnel, and a panzerklein hangar. From this point, the player may select a team of six characters from a pool of twenty. Each character has a role such as medic, sniper, scout, grenadier, soldier or engineer. Each role has different advantages and liabilities in battle. As the player progresses through the game, the armoury will receive new weapons for the player to use, either stolen from enemies or contributed from their own forces.<br/><br/>Silent Storm depicts the weaponry and equipment of circa 1943 with great detail. Mixed into otherwise realistic elements is a plot that features secret weapon projects reminiscent of spy-fi, including energy weapons. Most notable are the Panzerkleins (pseudo-German for &quot;little tanks&quot;), crude powered armour suits.<br/><br/>The game features a remarkably advanced physics model. Nearly all structures are completely destructible. This has many tactical effects in the combat. For instance, if a character hears an enemy moving in an adjacent room, they can simply fire through the wall to attack them.<br/><br/>Silent Storm employs ragdoll physics for bodies according to the precise velocity of an impact. Fully three-dimensional mapping allows for obstruction calculations and cover effects from all angles, bullets ricochet and their stopping power depends on the weapon. The effects are exaggerated for a more cinematic experience (a hail of non-fatal bullets only make the target shake, but a single fatal bullet can send the target flying).&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Silent_Storm,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73891": {"poll": [], "name": "Tekken 4", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US Playstation 2"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic791147.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Tekken"], "videogametheme": ["Anime", "Martial Arts"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "usersrated": "18", "videogamedeveloper": ["Namco Ltd."], "videogamefranchise": ["The Best (Best Selling PlayStation Games, JP)", "Greatest Hits (Best Selling PlayStation Games, US)"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2"], "videogamehonor": ["2002 Game Critics Best Fighting Game of the Year Winner", "2003 D.I.C.E.

It is the sequel to the Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War  video game series.<br/><br/>Playable armies at the initial release of the game include the Space Marines, Orks, Eldar, and Tyranids.<br/><br/>The gameplay of Dawn of War II is markedly different from that of Dawn of War and its expansions. Jonny Ebbert, the game's lead designer, describes the feel of the game by saying that it &quot;takes everything that was great about the original and combines it with the best that Company of Heroes had to offer.&quot; There is a heavier focus on cover, which gives more substantial defensive bonuses. Accordingly, there is also new emphasis on methods of dealing with units in cover. Some weapons, such as grenades and other explosives, can destroy cover, while others, such as flamers, ignore cover bonuses completely. Other differences between Dawn of War II and its predecessors include improved unit AI (squads under fire seek cover, for example), more realistically sized vehicles, and an improved physics engine.<br/><br/>As a Games for Windows - Live game, the game uses the Achievements system from Xbox LIVE, and is the first widely released, PC-exclusive game to use it.[6] Because of this, a player must be able to connect to the Windows Live servers in order to access the game's multiplayer features.

While the preceding games in the series, Myst and Riven, were produced by Cyan and published by Br&oslash;derbund, Exile was developed by Presto Studios and published by Ubisoft. The game was released on four compact discs for both Macintosh and Windows PCs on May 7, 2001; versions for the Xbox and PlayStation 2 were released in late 2002.<br/><br/>As in previous games, the player assumes the role of the Stranger, a friend of Atrus. A member of the D'ni race, Atrus can create links to other worlds called Ages by writing descriptive books. In Exile, Atrus has written an Age for the D'ni to live on while rebuilding their civilization; it is stolen, however, by a mysterious figure. The Stranger pursues the thief in an attempt to reclaim Atrus' book.<br/><br/>The creators of the Myst franchise gave the task of creating the third Myst game to Presto Studios, known for its adventure game series The Journeyman Project. Presto sought to develop a diverse and logical approach to puzzles and Ages, and worked to make the villain sympathetically multifaceted. The developers hired Jack Wall to develop a musical style different from earlier composer Robyn Miller but still recognizable as a Myst game. The project required millions of US dollars and more than two years to complete.<br/><br/>Exile was received well by critics; British newspaper The Daily Telegraph called it the best game in the Myst series. Conversely, long-time critics of the series complained that Exile continued to prove that Myst's slower gameplay did not belong in the fast-paced modern game market; GameSpot editor Greg Kasavin described the Myst series as having lost its relevance. Despite selling more than one million units within the first year of release, Exile fared poorer commercially than Myst and Riven, which had sold more than 10 million units combined. Presto Studios ceased software development entirely after the game's release, and Myst IV: Revelation, the fourth game in the series, was developed and published solely by Ubisoft.<br/>&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Myst_3,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73907": {"poll": [], "name": "Return of the Phantom", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US CD-ROM Edition", "US Disk Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic754349.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Alternate Historical", "Detective / Mystery"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["MicroProse"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS"], "average": "6", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["MicroProse"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic754349_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Return of the Phantom is a &quot;point-and-click&quot; style graphic animated adventure developed and published by MicroProse in 1993.

Revelation was the first game in the series released exclusively on a DVD-ROM format; a multiple CD-ROM version was not produced as it would have taken twelve compact discs to fit all the data. Like Myst III: Exile, Revelation combines pre-rendered graphics with digital video, but also features real-time 3D effects for added realism.<br/><br/>The plot of Revelation ties up loose ends from the original Myst. The player is summoned by Atrus, a man who creates links to other worlds known as Ages by writing special linking books. Almost twenty years earlier, Atrus' two sons nearly destroyed all of his linking books and were imprisoned; Atrus now wishes to see if his sons' imprisonment has reformed them. The player ends up traveling to each brother's prison, in an effort to recover Atrus' daughter Yeesha from the brothers' plot.<br/><br/>Development of Revelation lasted more than three years; Ubisoft had as many as eighty employees working on the game. Musician Peter Gabriel lent his voice and a song to the game's audio; the original score was written by Exile's composer Jack Wall. Overall, reception to the game was positive; reviewers lauded the impressive visuals, sound, and puzzles. Publications such as Computer Gaming World took issue with the control scheme of the game.

It was developed by Kuju Entertainment and was released in October 2003.<br/><br/>The game is a first person shooter, where the player takes the role of a Tau Fire Warrior, Kais, seeking to rescue his leader and defend his race from the aggressive Imperium of Man and forces of Chaos.<br/><br/>There is also a multiplayer mode consisting of Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Capture the Flag. Eight multiplayer maps are included with the game, Deathmatch having its own, and Team Deathmatch and Capture the Flag having their own. Fire Warrior was one of the first PlayStation 2 games to support 8 player games using its broadband adaptor.<br/><br/>The story takes place over a period of 24 hours. The game begins with Kais's first mission, an attempt to rescue Ko'vash from Governor Severus. He infiltrates Severus's prison-fortress, and escapes with Ko'vash intact. As the Orca dropship begins docking with the Tau Emissary class cruiser, it is attacked by an Imperial Battleship, and boarding pods are launched. Kais then fights a desperate battle against a force of Storm Troopers as they try to disable the cruiser's engines, and assassinate the Captain. After Kais fails to rescue the Captain, he and several teams of Fire-Warriors are launched, by boarding pod at the Imperial ship. There,he disables the ship's guns and nearly captures the ship's commander, Admiral Constantine. Kais is clubbed on the head by Captain Ardias, however, and is captured. Ardias brokers a truce between the Imperium and the Tau, and it is revealed that Governor Severus has been seduced by the Powers of Chaos, teleporting a contingent of Word Bearers Chaos Marines onto the ship. They capture the ship's remaining guns, in an attempt to re-start the Imperium-Tau war, but are stopped by Kais's destruction of the guns. Ardias then sets the ship to self-destruct, and Kais escapes via a Dreadnought drop-pod. Landing in the midst of a ruined Imperial city, Kais fights his way to fellow Tau Fire-Warriors, and learns from Ardias that Severus plans to use an Imperial Titan held in the City. Kais destroys the Titan, enters Severus's fortress, and kills Severus and his daemonic master. The game ends with Ardias ordering that the planet should be destroyed to prevent the taint of Chaos from spreading. Many adversaries from the Warhammer 40,000 universe are encountered by the protagonist Kais, such as Dreadnoughts, Chaos Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Daemon princes, and an Imperial Valkyrie.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Warhammer_40,000_Fire_Warrior,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73910": {"videogame": ["Myst: The Collection"], "poll": [], "name": "Myst V: End of Ages", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/UK Windows & Mac edition", "NA Windows edition", "Scandinavian Windows/Macintosh edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic842710.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Myst"], "videogametheme": ["Puzzle"], "usersrated": "25", "videogamecharacter": ["Atrus", "The Stranger (Myst)"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Cyan Worlds, Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Macintosh", "Windows"], "average": "7.16", "statistics": [], "videogamecompilation": ["Myst: The Collection"], "videogamepublisher": ["Ubisoft Entertainment S.A.

The game was developed by Cyan Worlds, published by Ubisoft, and released for Macintosh and Windows PC platforms on September 20, 2005. As in previous games in the series, End of Ages's gameplay consists of navigating worlds known as &quot;Ages&quot; via the use of special books and items which act as portals. On each Age, the player solves puzzles and discovers story clues hidden in the Ages or written down in diaries and journals. The player's actions in the game decide the fate of the ancient D'ni civilization.<br/><br/>In a departure from previous titles in the Myst series, End of Ages replaces pre-rendered environments with worlds rendered in real-time 3D graphics, allowing players to freely navigate the Ages. The faces of actors were digitally mapped onto three-dimensional character models to preserve realism. Cyan paid attention to making the game more accessible to new players by the addition of multiple methods of navigation and an in-game camera. Myst creator Rand Miller decided to give players the ability to decide the fates of the game's characters as a gift to Myst fans.<br/><br/>End of Ages was positively received upon release. Despite complaints such as lessened interactivity compared to previous games and poorer graphics, publications including Macworld, Computer Gaming World, and The Washington Post judged the game a fitting end to the series. After End of Ages's release, Cyan abruptly announced the end of software development and the layoff of most of its staff, but was able to rehire much of the development team a few weeks later. Including End of Ages's sales, the Myst franchise had sold more than 12 million copies by November 2007.<br/>&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Myst_V,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73911": {"poll": [], "name": "Ribbit King", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US Gamecube edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1186800.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Cute Fantasy", "Sports - Golf"], "usersrated": "4", "videogamedeveloper": ["Jamsworks Co., Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["GameCube"], "average": "5.5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Bandai"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1186800_t.jpg", "description": "[User summary]<br/><br/>In Ribbit King you play a golf like sports game called Frolf.

Departing from previous games of the franchise, Uru takes place in the modern era and allows players to customize their onscreen avatars. Players use their avatars to explore the abandoned city of an ancient race known as the D'ni, uncover story clues and solve puzzles.<br/><br/>Cyan began developing Uru shortly after completing Riven in 1997, leaving future Myst sequels to be produced by third party developers. Uru required five years and $12 million to complete. Uru was initially conceived as a multiplayer game; the single-player portion was released, but the multiplayer component, Uru Live, was delayed and eventually canceled. The online video game service GameTap released the multiplayer portion of Uru as Myst Online: Uru Live in February 2007, but the service was canceled again the following year due to a lack of subscribers. GameTap passed the rights to Uru Live back to Cyan, who announced their intention to resurrect the game.<br/><br/>Uru was not as well received as previous Myst titles. Critics admired the visuals and new features of the game but criticized the lack of multiplayer in the retail version and clunky controls. Uru sold poorly, while the first three games had sold millions of copies each. The game was a critical and commercial disappointment for Cyan, causing the company financial troubles; nevertheless, it has attracted a cult following.<br/>&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Uru:_Ages_Beyond_Myst,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73914": {"videogame": ["Megapak 4"], "poll": [], "name": "Dragon Lore: The Legend Begins", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["German DOS & Windows edition", "UK Windows edition", "US DOS & Windows edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic776300.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Cryo Interactive Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS", "Windows"], "average": "6", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Mindscape Games"], "videogamecompilation": ["Megapak 4"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic776300_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Dragon Lore is a point-and-click adventure game released in 1994 by Cryo Interactive for MS-DOS CD-ROM, and later ported to the 3DO game console.

It is a god game  released in 2001, which included elements of artificial life, strategy, and fighting games.<br/><br/>The player acts as a god and takes control over villages across several islands. Black &amp; White features a unique gameplay element, a creature that the player can raise and teach. The game was highly anticipated and overall well received.<br/><br/>It was followed by an expansion, Black &amp; White: Creature Isle, and a sequel, Black &amp; White 2.<br/><br/>A port for the Sega Dreamcast was in development but got canceled due to the end of the system's production line.<br/><br/>The player takes on the role of a god ruling over an island populated by various tribes. The player's control over the island is manifested in the Hand, an animated on-screen hand which can move or throw people and objects, tap houses to wake their occupants, cast miracles, and do many other things. Use of the keyboard and buttons in the game is purposely low; to add to the sense of realism, the (usually) mouse-controlled hand can perform every function in the game. In later patches, the Hand can also be controlled by an Essential Reality P5 Glove, a consumer-level virtual reality glove that is no longer for sale.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, the goal of a level is to gain control over every village on the island. This is accomplished through the performance of impressive acts that will cause the villagers to believe in the player. Villagers can be swayed by everything from helping them with day-to-day tasks to terrorising them with fireballs and lightning storms. Another important element of the gameplay is the player's Creature &mdash; a pet of sorts that can be trained to do almost anything, thanks to the game's complex AI, developed by Richard Evans. This Creature is trained by being placed on a leash while the player demonstrates the action the Creature is to learn using the Hand. With time and repetition, it can perform complex functions that will allow it to serve as the player's avatar in the world.<br/><br/>The principle behind the game's name is the conflict between good and evil. Nearly every action (or lack thereof) will count towards the player's image in the people's eyes. As such, the player may be seen as a heart wrenchingly good god or an utterly evil one. The land and interface will shift according to the player's alignment. A good god will have a white marble temple, a shining white hand, and a peaceful village filled with light. Conversely, an evil god will have a charred, clawed hand, a black temple sprouting venomous red spikes, and thoroughly terrified villagers. Good players try to win over villages through constant help. Common tactics are to donate food and wood, construct buildings, protect the village from other gods, send missionaries, and use the Creature to entertain the villagers. However, villagers become bored with the same attempt to impress them being repeated. In other words if boulders flying overhead become too frequent, they will lose their effect. This forces the player to mix up the methods he uses to convert a village. One can use a balance of good and evil, trying to stay in the gray area. The game presents so many different ways to please a village, however, that the player is never forced to use evil or forced to use good.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Black_&amp;_White_(video_game),&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73926": {"poll": [], "name": "Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Australian GameCube edition", "Japanese GameCube edition", "UK GameCube edition", "US GameCube edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic855751.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Baten Kaitos"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "32", "videogamedeveloper": ["Monolith Soft", "Tri-Crescendo Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["GameCube"], "average": "7.25", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Namco Ltd."], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic855751_t.jpg", "description": "[From the box]<br/><br/>At a time when Earth and OCean are merely fairytale and the world now exists as floating islands in the sky, two young heroes discover their fates are intertwined as they battle to save their home world.

Espionage, turf wars, netrunning - all seem to be part of the trope. But the world has changed since cyberpunk was invented.<br/><br/>Welcome to cyberpunk 2.0. Prepare to enter a unique gaming world and split yourself in two.<br/><br/>Literally.  Cyberpunk 1.0 games allowed each player control of one character (a player-character or PC) and typically had the characters work together as an adventuring party against the game environment, which was under the exclusive control of the game master (GM).<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s not the way Nanopunk works.<br/><br/>Sure, there&rsquo;s a GM and players. Sure the players have characters and the GM sets the stage, the environment, so to speak. But the environment is filled with characters, and why should the GM be the only one to control multiple entities?<br/>Now, I know what you experienced gamers are thinking. It&rsquo;s hard to actively control two or more characters and give the role-playing of both equal attention. I agree. That&rsquo;s why your second character isn&rsquo;t really a person and isn&rsquo;t part of your adventuring party. Instead, your second character is actually one of the world&rsquo;s largest and most powerful corporations. It can act through its agents or through the nanotechnology that everyone (yes, even the other PCs) has embedded inside. And it&rsquo;s often working against the PCs.<br/><br/>At this point, I can hear more objections from the experienced gamers. How are you going to have anything interesting happen when you depend on the players to make life hard for their own characters?  Fortunately, I don&rsquo;t have to solve that problem. The various mechanics of the FATE game system make this process much easier to manage. So if you aren&rsquo;t familiar with FATE, there is a brief introduction to the main ideas later on, but you really must read the rules.<br/><br/>"}, "73933": {"poll": [], "name": "SWAT 3: Close Quarters Battle", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Dutch/French The Games Collection Windows edition", "Itallian Windows Sierra Best Sellers Edition", "US Windows Standard Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic753443.jpg", "videogameseries": ["SWAT"], "videogametheme": ["Crime"], "usersrated": "21", "videogamedeveloper": ["Sierra Entertainment Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["First Person Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "7.33333", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sierra Entertainment Inc."], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic753443_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;SWAT 3: Close Quarters Battle (also known as SWAT3  or SWAT3:CQB) is a tactical squad-based first-person shooter, developed by Sierra Northwest and published by parent Sierra Entertainment for the PC on November 23, 1999. SWAT3 remains the biggest selling title of the SWAT series, and is the only member of the SWAT series to come close to the popularity of the earlier titles of the Police Quest series, from which it originated although it's the first game in the series which omits the name Police Quest.<br/><br/>As the first first-person shooter of the Police Quest/SWAT games, SWAT3 received a new game engine with cell and portal technologies for simulation of environments, and advanced AI and ballistics. The developers spent some time with LAPD SWAT, studying tactics in order to create an accurate, realistic simulation. Most of the animations in the game were motion captured, acted out by a SWAT officer.<br/><br/>The player assumes the role of a Los Angeles Police Department SWAT element leader, in command of a five-man element. Over a number of missions, the player has to defend the city from violent criminals, terrorists and the threat of a nuclear weapon, and prevent disruption of an important treaty signing. The game also features multiplayer including traditional Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch modes in addition to Paintball mode and Cooperative play through the single player missions.<br/><br/>SWAT 3 was succeeded by SWAT 4 in April 2005, development and publishing being transferred to Irrational Games and Sierra owner Vivendi Universal.<br/><br/>As the name indicates, the game is based on CQB  tactics. The player is in charge of a 5-man SWAT element, and unlike other tactical shooters, such as the comparable Rainbow Six games, the player is a police  officer; therefore arresting rather than simply shooting suspects on sight is the primary objective. The improper use of deadly force (when a suspect is wounded and unable to use weapons, has surrendered or poses no threat) is penalized in the game.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;SWAT_3,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73934": {"rpgartist": ["David R.

As of 2008, the game is one of the ten most played Half-Life modifications in terms of players, according to GameSpy.<br/><br/>Day of Defeat is a 3D multiplayer shooter that simulates squad-level infantry  combat between the adversaries of World War II's European Theatre; the Allies or the Axis Powers. The goal is to complete various mission objectives.<br/><br/>Players can choose between the Allied armies (American and/or British armies, depending on the map) or the Axis armies. In Day of Defeat:Source there are only the American and German armies.<br/><br/>A round begins with two opposing teams starting simultaneously in their respective spawn area of a map. A round ends when one team accomplishes all of its objectives.<br/><br/>Player casualties become reinforcements which are supplied according to a timer. The reinforcements originate at spawn and can be composed of anywhere from 1 soldier to the entire team. The reinforcement timer is usually between 10-20 seconds, but this time may vary from server to server.<br/><br/>Like other Half-Life mods, Day of Defeat tracks each player's accomplishment in team objectives, how many enemies each player has eliminated and how many times each player has died. The game also tallies these statistics for the entire team; this reflects the team's score which is primarily based on objectives.<br/><br/>After many rounds, the game ends when a set time limit expires, and the team with the most objectives achieved is the winning team regardless of kills or casualties, except in the case where both teams have not achieved any objectives or are tied in the objective score. The scoreboard is displayed and the game is restarted with another map.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Day_of_Defeat,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73939": {"poll": [], "name": "Spider-Man: Friend or Foe", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Nintendo DS edition", "North American PlayStation 2 edition", "North American PSP edition", "North American Wii edition", "North American Xbox 360 edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1467836.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Comics"], "videogamefranchise": ["Marvel", "Spider-Man"], "videogamecharacter": ["Spider-Man"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Artificial Mind and Movement", "Next Level Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo DS", "PlayStation 2", "PSP", "Wii", "Windows", "Xbox 360"], "usersrated": "8", "average": "7.375", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Activision"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1467836_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Spider-Man: Friend or Foe is a Spider-Man  computer and video game based on the comic book series and Spider-Man movies.

The horse in question was to bear a Roman noble called Constantine away from his lord Galerius. While Constantine was a promising officer, he was a little too promising and Galerius had made a point of keeping him and his father separate. Constantine was a virtual hostage in Galerius&rsquo; court. One night word came to Constantine that his life was in danger and he fled for his father&rsquo;s court. He drove several horses to exhaustion, desperate to escape quickly as leaving was treason, and treason was death. Had he reached his father&rsquo;s camp Constantine would have one day led the<br/>Roman Empire.<br/><br/>He would have taken control of the western Empire and led a conquest of the east that would have made him absolute ruler of a new and stronger empire. He would have also converted to the tiny yet troublesome religion of Christianity, and eventually ordered Rome to adopt it as the state religion. He<br/>would have formed the Nicean councils that ensured<br/>disagreements in the Christian church were managed and settled,<br/>so as to maintain unity in the faith. When Rome eventually fell the faith in this religion would have bound the peoples of Europe together and gave them a commonality they could use to repel the incursions from the east.<br/><br/>However, all this was not to be.

Developed by the Danish IO Interactive in Denmark and released by Eidos Interactive, in 2000 for Microsoft Windows, it remains the only PC-exclusive Hitman game. Hitman 2: Silent Assassin is its sequel.<br/><br/>The story centers around Agent 47, a bald test subject branded with a barcode tattooed on the back of his head, who is rigorously trained in methods of murder. Upon escaping from a test facility, 47 is hired by the Agency, a European contract killing organization. His mission takes him to several locations&mdash;Hong Kong, Colombia, Hungary, and the Netherlands&mdash;to assassinate wealthy and decadent criminals.<br/><br/>Though the game takes place from a third-person perspective Hitman's control setup is akin to first-person shooter: 47's movements are restricted to turning, strafing  and moving forward. The player can peek around corners by using the lean function, which prompts 47 to tilt slightly to one side. 47 is able to climb ladders, but cannot defend himself with a weapon while doing so. In addition, he is only be able to jump from one balcony to another. 47 creates 'sound' while walking which will alert any hostile characters in the facility. To move without being detected, the player can use the &quot;sneak&quot; function, which causes 47 to crouch and move in a stalking manner. Sneaking also allows 47 to retrieve a weapon from his inventory without anyone hearing it; if 47 is standing upright when the player pulls out a weapon, it will alert nearby characters.<br/><br/>An on-screen cursor which indicates which direction 47's attack will attack. The heads-up display includes a life bar (which measures 47's health), ammo capacity, kevlar durability, and the current item selected. Alert messages sometimes appear next to the health readout. These occur whenever enemies discover a body on the map, or if 47 falls under suspicion.<br/><br/>Disguise plays a large role in Hitman's gameplay. Any time a non-player character is killed, 47 may take their clothes and impersonate them. This is necessary to access restricted areas where only guards may enter. At the start of each level, 47 begins in a default costume. This costume is folded and left on the ground whenever 47 changes clothes. The player may replace 47's outfit with a previous one by simply approaching them and selecting the &quot;Change clothes&quot; option.<br/><br/>47's weaponry consists of various short and long-range firearms, a garrote wire, and a knife. Pistols generally have excellent range, while automatic rifles and machine guns decrease in accuracy the farther away 47 is from his target. 47 can also equip himself with a sniper rifle, concealed in a special suitcase, which must be reassembled before he may use it. Once he is finished with the rifle, 47 can take it apart and place it the suitcase once more.<br/><br/>Characters who are dead may be dragged at any time. If anyone on the map spots a body lying on the ground, it will create unwanted attention for 47. In the event that 47 adopted the clothes of someone he has slain, his disguise will be compromised as soon as the body is discovered. When dragging, 47 lifts up the closest available leg or arm and begins to hoist it away.<br/><br/>Each level of Hitman takes place in an open environment which is teeming with non-player civilians and armed guards. Although mission criteria may vary, the goal is generally to find 47's assigned target and kill them by any means possible. Though the path may appear linear, it is rarely possible to approach a target directly without eliciting a violent reprisal.<br/><br/>On a technological note, Hitman: Codename 47 was one of the first games to use the now popular ragdoll physics.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Hitman:_Codename_47,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73958": {"videogame": ["RollerCoaster Tycoon 2: Gold Edition", "RollerCoaster Tycoon 2: Triple Thrill Pack"], "poll": [], "name": "RollerCoaster Tycoon 2", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Australian Windows edition", "Canadian Windows (Cereal Pack-In) edition", "Dutch/French Windows edition", "English/European Windows edition", "German Windows edition", "Japanese Windows edition", "North American Windows edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic776378.jpg", "videogameseries": ["RollerCoaster Tycoon"], "videogametheme": ["Amusement Park"], "usersrated": "109", "videogameexpansion": ["RollerCoaster Tycoon 2: Time Twister", "RollerCoaster Tycoon 2: Wacky Worlds"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Chris Sawyer Productions"], "videogamegenre": ["Management", "Sandbox"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "7.60688", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Atari, Inc.", "Infogrames Melbourne House Pty Ltd."], "videogamecompilation": ["RollerCoaster Tycoon 2: Gold Edition", "RollerCoaster Tycoon 2: Triple Thrill Pack"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic776378_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 is a simulation computer game that simulates theme park management. Developed by Chris Sawyer and published by Infogrames, the game was released on October 15, 2002. It is the sequel to RollerCoaster Tycoon and is the second game in the RollerCoaster Tycoon series. In 2004, a sequel, Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, was released.<br/><br/>The premise of the game is to complete scenarios by successfully building and maintaining theme parks. Players can choose between various attractions, including transport rides, gentle and thrill rides, roller coasters, water rides, and shops or stalls. The player can further modify the park by changing the land and scenery. Players must satisfy the needs of the visitors by building food stalls, drink stands, bathrooms, souvenir shops, and facilities, like ATMs, information kiosks, and more. Players must balance their budget in their expenses and income.<br/><br/>One of the most notable differences from the original game is that RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 features a more robust system for building structures, in which one can lay each piece of wall and roof individually. Additionally, the game allows a piece of scenery to be locked in place and have its height adjusted, providing greater flexibility. The mechanics in the original game made custom building construction more difficult. Another departure from the original was allowing any ride or shop to be fixed at any elevation, including underground. Previously, only rides that had tracks could be built underground, since the player had to build the first piece above the ground, then extend the track below ground afterward.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;RollerCoaster_Tycoon_2,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73959": {"poll": [], "name": "RunMan: Race Around the World", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic756752.jpg", "videogameseries": ["RunMan"], "videogametheme": ["Cute Fantasy"], "usersrated": "6", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "7", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic756752_t.jpg", "description": "A platform game with cheerful outlook and cartoon graphics and emphasis on speed as well as timing like the Sega Sonic series.<br/><br/>From developer's site:<br/><br/>Features<br/>    * Run through 35+ levels across 6 unique and preposterous zones!<br/>    * Complete ridiculous feats of speed to earn shiny medals!<br/>    * Unlock 4 lovable secret characters and probably some other stuff!<br/>    * Colorful, bright, crude, colorful graphics!<br/>    * Classic tunes courtesy of masters like Robert Johnson, Louis Armstrong, Blind Blake, and more!<br/>    * You can't die!<br/><br/>"}, "73960": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic754910.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Red Poppies Campaigns: The Battles for Ypres"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["John Gorkowski"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Ian Wedge"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Worthington Games"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic754910_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War I"], "description": "Red Poppies simulates regimental-sized engagements from WWI with company-level units in 10 minute turns on maps scaled at 200 yards per hex.

The dark castles he had built were abandoned and slowly fell into ruin and the villagers across the countryside no longer lived in fear. As the years went by, the secret of the powerful Kuji magic was hidden away in ancient shrines, and the people of the villages and towns went back to their daily lives.<br/><br/>Then one day, something changed. Terrible storms began to brew over the mountain on the distant horizon. Floods and earthquakes began to appear in the flatlands. At Ninja Mountain, The Ninja Master could see that something was terribly wrong in the world. Mysterious figures were seen hunting and caging animals for unknown reasons. The truth was that the Evil Samurai Warlord had returned, using the forbidden Kuji magic to transform innocent animals into mindless samurai warriors to use to recapture his dark castles and take over the world. But, by using the Kuji magic for evil purposes, the Evil Samurai Warlord was once again upsetting the balance of nature, bring the wrath of the gods down upon the earth in the form of ravaging storms. The larger his armies grew, the worse the storms became.<br/><br/>The Ninja Master knew none of this yet... though he knew that something must be done and made it his unbreakable oath. He sent his best ninja to discover the truth of the storms, but no word returned from the ninja. One by one, he sent another, but again and again... nothing. Until he was left with only two left, Hiro and Futo. The Ninja Master was hesitant to send his last two, but he knew the fate of the world would lay in their hands.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Mini_Ninjas,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73510": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic96033.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jakob Bonds", "Dan Glimne"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1987", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Anders Jeppsson"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Alga"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic96033_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy", "Fighting"], "description": "Drakborgen II is the Swedish expansion to the original Drakborgen, better known internationally as Dungeonquest.

The story is told through cutscenes, scripted events, telegraph messages, and intelligence that the player finds scattered throughout the game. The game involves the main character, B.J. Blazkowicz, going to a fictional German town called Isenstadt, which serves as &quot;hub&quot; for the player throughout the game. Isenstadt is where the player can get missions from two different groups, or upgrade their weapons and powers at the Black Market.<br/><br/>There are a total of nine weapons, six real-life ones (grenades, the MP40, the Kar98k, the MP43, the Panzerschreck, and the Flammenwerfer) and three fictional ones (the Particle Cannon, the Tesla Gun, and the Leichenfaust 44). Mounted MG42s can be found throughout the game, and each one can be used by the player.<br/><br/>Aside from the weapons, the player also finds a medallion called the &quot;Thule Medallion&quot;. With it, the player can get many abilities. The abilities are Veil Sight (the ability to see secrets, and, once upgraded, through walls), Mire (the ability to slow down time), Shield (the ability to throw up a shield that blocks, and, once upgraded, bounces back bullets), and Empower (the ability to significantly increase the damage of the player's weapons).<br/><br/>Every time the player activates the Medallion, the player enters a dimension called the &quot;Veil&quot;, which is a barrier between this dimension and the fictional &quot;Black Sun&quot; dimension, the power source the Nazis want to master. Inside the Veil, the player can see floating creatures called &quot;geists&quot;. Geists can be destroyed, and destroying them releases an energy burst which can kill or stun nearby enemies. Geists are usually passive, but if the player kills one, others can become angry and attack the player in a suicidal explosion.<br/><br/>Various items can be collected throughout the game: Gold, Intelligence, and Tomes of Power. Gold is used as currency to buy various upgrades from the Black Market. Intelligence provides some background information about the story, and is used to unlock some of the upgrades for weapons. Tomes of Power are used to upgrade the Veil Powers.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Wolfenstein_(2009_video_game),&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73514": {"poll": [], "name": "Blue Dragon", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Australian Xbox 360 edition", "Italian Xbox 360 edition", "North American Xbox 360 edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic751891.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Blue Dragon"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "28", "videogamedeveloper": ["Artoon", "Mistwalker"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Xbox 360"], "videogamehonor": ["2006 Japan Game Awards Best Unreleased Game Winner", "2007 Japan Game Awards Game of the Year Winner"], "average": "6.37143", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Microsoft Game Studios"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic751891_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Blue Dragon follows the story of five friends (Shu, Jiro, Kluke, Zola, and Marumaro) as they travel across the world to confront Nene, the evil king of the Grand Kingdom.

The project was headed by Gregg Mayles and the team behind the Banjo-Kazooie series, based on an idea from Tim Stamper. Although rumors of the title circulated among fans for some time, Viva Pi&ntilde;ata was officially announced on March 15, 2006, and first released in November 2006. With a &quot;general audiences&quot; or &quot;everyone&quot; rating, the game provides bright, colorful visuals, intended to appeal to children and more casual gamers. The game received a positive reaction from game critics, despite its poor sales and pre-release advertising.<br/><br/>Likened to The Sims, Animal Crossing  and Harvest Moon, the game tasks the player with turning a neglected plot of land into a beautiful garden. As with many sandbox games, the game is open-ended, with no strict winning or losing requirements. Instead, players are guided only generally towards the objectives of increasing their garden's value and attracting pi&ntilde;ata  residents. Players are free to determine their own sub-goals and work towards them.<br/><br/>Developing a successful garden requires setting up the land and foliage appropriately to attract pi&ntilde;atas, as well as purchasing various items to place within the garden (e.g., homes for the pi&ntilde;atas). When certain requirements are fulfilled, the garden will attract a simple black-and-white version of a given pi&ntilde;ata species. After fulfilling additional requirements, the pi&ntilde;ata will become a resident, changing into a full-color version. Once two pi&ntilde;atas of the same species are residents and their mating (romance) requirements are met, they can perform a romance dance, resulting in a baby pi&ntilde;ata egg. No pi&ntilde;ata has a gender specific design, and hence any two pi&ntilde;atas of the same species can mate (with inter-species romances possible as well in a few cases). After a given pi&ntilde;ata species has successfully romanced, the player no longer needs to fulfill the full romance requirements for pi&ntilde;ata of that type, but can instead simply have the pi&ntilde;ata eat a specific type of candy.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Viva_Pi\u00f1ata,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73521": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic752094.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Crime"], "videogamefranchise": ["Grand Theft Auto", "Greatest Hits (Best Selling PlayStation Games, US)", "Platinum Range (Best Selling PlayStation Games, PAL)", "Xbox Classics (Best Selling Xbox 360 Games, PAL)"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 3", "Windows", "Xbox 360"], "poll": [], "videogamecompilation": ["Grand Theft Auto IV: The Complete Edition"], "statistics": [], "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Dutch Windows edition", "Dutch Xbox 360 edition", "English/European Xbox 360 edition", "French Xbox 360 (Special Edition) edition", "Italian PlayStation 3 edition", "Italian Windows edition", "Italian Xbox 360 edition", "North American PlayStation 3 edition", "North American Xbox 360 edition", "UK PlayStation 3 edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "videogamecharacter": ["Johnny (GTA)"], "vgcharacterversion": ["Johnny"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic752094_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Grand Theft Auto IV is a sandbox-style action-adventure video game developed by Rockstar North, and released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in Oceania, Europe, and North America on 29 April 2008, and in Japan on 30 October 2008.<br/><br/>Two episodic packs have since been released for the Xbox 360, the first entitled The Lost and Damned, released on 17 February 2009.

Participants interact to create an adventurous story. A role-playing game is really nothing more an evolved form of traditional children's make-believe games such as &quot;cops &amp; robbers&quot;, &quot;playing house&quot;, and &quot;cowboys &amp; Indians&quot;, albeit with a more structured set of rules to be followed. Like most other RPG's, Nutshell is not a contest to be &quot;won&quot; by any of the players. The goal is instead for each participant to find enjoyment in ongoing character development and furtherance of plot within the bounds of an interesting background setting.<br/><br/>Game-play in Nutshell is conducted by one player serving as the Game Master (GM) who narrates and moderates the events while the other participants take on the roles of player's-characters (PC's) who are the protagonists of the game's story. The GM has the demanding job of furnishing the background setting and portraying all of the non-player characters (NPC's) whom are the sidekicks, extras, antagonists, monsters, and/or villains with whom the PC's will interact.<br/><br/>Nutshell is intentionally simple and easy to understand. Having been designed for novice and experienced gamers alike, these rules are ideally suited for those wishing their role-playing sessions to involve minimal intrusion from underlying game-mechanics. Due to this fact, many things necessarily fall outside the scope of Nutshell (being left to the prerogative of the GM) and players must be willing to accept their GM's final decision on all matters. It is therefore important to choose a fair and consistent GM of high caliber who is capable of applying logic, sound reasoning, and &quot;common sense.&quot;<br/><br/>Nutshell's game mechanics focus on the aspects and capabilities of normal human beings as characters. If it is desired that non-human characters, magic, and/or &quot;super powers&quot; are options available to the PC's, these rules will need to be altered and expanded accordingly. (Supplemental rules covering these often &quot;genre/setting-specific&quot; things may be published at a later date by Nutshell's author and/or others expanding on the Nutshell RPG System!)<br/><br/>"}, "73545": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["QuestFRP (Version 4.0)"], "statistics": [], "name": "QuestFRP Player's Handbook", "rpgdesigner": ["Michael Behrman", "Michael Greenholdt", "Gene Masters", "Todd Richmond"], "rpgproducer": ["Michael Behrman", "Michael Greenholdt", "Gene Masters", "Todd Richmond"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1208186.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["text document available for download"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Sword & Sorcery)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1208186_t.jpg", "description": "from the introduction:<br/><br/>This fantasy role playing game, Quest, is designed to be an open-ended game system in which you, the Player, design your own Character conception.

The Game Master may use these as a guide for making decisions concerning other effects, but he or she should not feel constrained by these discussions.<br/><br/>Potential Players and Game Masters should note that unlike most fantasy role playing games, reasonably high levels of technology are possible within the system. If the Game Master or Players feel too uncomfortable, they may, of course, agree to eliminate the Technical skills, although this is NOT recommended.

(In Europe on April 27, 1995 as Unirally). Uniracers is a racing game where the players control unicycles and have to perform stunts and tricks to gain speed. The game got generally positive reviews.<br/><br/>In the game it is important to use the moments the Unicycle is in the air as efficiently as possible by performing as many stunts as possible. This give the unicycle more speed. For maximum acceleration it is also needed to have a wide variation in the stunts performed. With every failed stunt (where the unicycle doesn't land properly back on it's wheel) the player looses speed. The color of the track gives information as to whats coming ahead, or what stunts (not) to perform. The game consists of 9 tours of 5 races. Every tour has two race events (from A to B), two circuit events (a number of laps) and one stunt track (score points performing stunts). In every event the player competes with one opponent and can obtain a Bronze, Silver or Gold rank depending on the results. The graphical style of the game is minimalistic but unique and fits to the high-speed nature of the game.<br/><br/>The player can choose from 16 differently colored Unicycles, and a name can be set for each of them. The game support 2-player gameplay using a split-screen mode. On top of that the game supports a League-mode where up to 8 players can compete in a tournament.

It is generally considered to be the fifth mainstream game of the Call of Duty series and returns the setting to World War II, after the storyline of the previous title, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare  was based in the present day. The game was released in North America on November 11, 2008 and in Europe on November 14, 2008. A Windows Mobile version was also made available by Glu Mobile and different storyline versions for the Nintendo DS and PlayStation 2 were also produced, but remain in the World War II setting. The game is based on an enhanced version of the Call of Duty 4 game engine developed by Infinity Ward with increased development on audio and visual effects.<br/><br/>The narrative for the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360 versions focuses on the Pacific and Eastern Front theatres of World War II, involving the United States, the Empire of Japan, the Soviet Union, and Nazi Germany. It is told from the perspectives of Marine Raider Private Miller and Red Army soldier Private Dimitri Petrenko and is based on several historical battles. The multiplayer component of the game contains various game modes and a leveling system that allows the player to unlock additional weapons and rewards as they progress, similar to Call of Duty 4. The game also contains downloadable content called &quot;map packs&quot;, which can be purchased online. A new feature to the series was the addition of a cooperative mode, which supports up to two players locally and four players online.<br/><br/>The game was the second best-selling game for November 2008 in the United States, selling over 1.41 million units. In the UK, it sold twice as many units as Call of Duty 4 in its first week after release, becoming the third fastest-selling video game. It received positive reviews, with praise for its portrayal of the gritty, dark side of war and multiple game modes. However, it was criticized for not building on the success of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. Call of Duty: World at War currently holds an 85% aggregate score on GameRankings and Metacritic.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Call_of_Duty:_World_at_War,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73591": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic754166.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Konrad Anft"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Konrad Anft"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "(Web published)"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic754166_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Exploration", "Maze", "Medical", "Nautical", "Print & Play", "Science Fiction"], "description": "The N.E.A.K.

Written with the love of horror and the grotesque in mind, this book contains everything you need to host your own horror table top rpg using the Nightmare Worlds system. We cover the basics naturally, from rules of play, to character creation, and most anything else you&rsquo;d come to expect from a role playing game. We also give tips on adventure and campaign construction, along with ideas for settings and creature design.<br/><br/>Nightmare Worlds was written to accomplish three goals for the author<br/>that, more or less, revolve around sake of ease. First, this book was designed to be a stand alone product. That means that while we&rsquo;d love to have you buy every book in the line, we do not cripple your game by requiring you to buy a dozen different books to get a complete usable system. The author is a budget gamer like many others, and we&rsquo;ve included everything you need here, from character creation to tips on adventure construction and setting. The second goal was to make the system very simple to use. Playing Nightmare Worlds is as easy as flipping a playing card, as our entire system uses a simple playing card mechanic. A deck of playing cards, some paper and pens, and a few friends is all you need. There is some prep work in ensuring your playing the right cards (see below), but for the most part it is very minor. Finally it should be stated that Nightmare Worlds was designed to be a &quot;generic&quot; system for the most part, meaning that it is meant to be a tool for Game Masters first and foremost for use in anything they wish to design.

Developed by EA Canada, it is published by Electronic Arts worldwide under the EA Sports label. It was released on all popular gaming formats in September 2007 in Europe, Australia, and Asia, and in October 2007 in North America. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game feature an improved game engine with superior graphics and different commentators and are dubbed &quot;next-generation&quot; by EA. On all other platforms - including the PC - the game utilizes an older engine. The Nintendo DS version features fewer teams, stadiums, game modes and kits due to the limitations of the machine's storage medium. Commentary comes from Sky Sports' Martin Tyler and Andy Gray on next generation consoles; however, ITV Sports' Clive Tyldesley partners Gray on current generation consoles, and the PC version of the game. On the DS  version of the game, Tyldesley is by himself. It also marks the first time the original Xbox  has been excluded from the FIFA lineup since FIFA Football 2002.<br/><br/>The tagline for the game is &quot;Can You FIFA 08?.&quot; The theme song is &quot;Sketches (20 Something Life)&quot; by La Rocca, from the album The Truth.<br/><br/>New features that were not in FIFA 07  include &quot;Be a Pro Mode&quot;, where the player plays as only one player (the player can be changed) throughout the entire match.[3]  However, this mode is not available for goalkeepers.<br/><br/>New features for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 include cooperative online play and a change of controls which features the right stick as a way of selecting which player to be on defense. However, this control setting can be changed back to the FIFA 07 configuration as well as other preset control configurations. In addition, the online mode has a new addition with interactive leagues, where players choose a league, a team, and play against real-life opponents. While not an entirely new feature, FIFA 08 includes new trick moves which can be used by using the right analog stick which were for the most part, absent in FIFA 07. In general, the speed of game also has decreased in FIFA 08.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;FIFA_08,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73595": {"rpgdesigner": ["Chad Bowser", "Jennifer Brozek", "Walt Ciechanowski", "James Desborough", "Caz Granberg", "Simson Leigh", "Andi Newton", "Andrew Peregrine", "Scott Rhymer", "Peter Schweighofer"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Softcover"], "poll": [], "name": "The Secret Masters", "rpgartist": ["Talon Dunning", "Andrew Hepworth", "Jon Hodgson", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Huguenin", "Linda M.

The world itself is broken up into multiple city-states, each with their own unique culture. The story of the game revolves around &quot;Remnants&quot;, mysterious and coveted ancient artifacts of varying shapes and sizes which possess magic powers and have been the cause of several wars throughout the game's history. Each Remnant is &quot;bound&quot; to a specific person, who is the only one who can then use their power; powerful Remnants that remain unbound for too long have the potential to cause a &quot;collapse&quot; and spawn monsters. As Remnants come in varying forms, all cities throughout the world have at least one that their ruler is bound to that assist to govern and bring peace to their assigned realm.<br/><br/>The protagonist is Rush Sykes, an 18-year-old Mitra boy from a peaceful island. His 14-year-old sister, Irena, is kidnapped at the start of the game, and finding her is Rush's impetus for leaving the island. He immediately comes across David Nassau, the 19-year-old Mitra ruler of the city-state of Athlum, and his four generals: the 41-year-old Mitra Emma Honeywell, the 24-year-old Yama Blocter, the 55-year-old Qsiti Pagus, and the 200-year-old Sovani Torgal. These characters can be joined by several dozen other characters, many of whom are found through quests, while others can be hired at guilds. Every character has their own name and skillset, though the main characters have special additional skills. The main villain is the Conqueror, a Mitra who during the course of the game attacks many city-states of the world with his army. He is helped in this regard, first in secret and then openly, by Wilfred Hermeien, an older Mitra who is both the leader of the city-state of Nagapur with the ruling council of all of the city-states, and assisted by Wagram, a powerful Mitra sorcerer.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Last_Remnant,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73600": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jeff Dee"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Homecoming", "rpgartist": ["Jeff Dee"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic751270.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "3", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["UNIgames"], "rpg": ["Pocket Universe"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic751270_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>User summary<br/><br/>Homecoming is an introductory fantasy adventure for the Pocket Universe system.<br/><br/>The player characters are soldiers that come back to their hometown after their army had been defeated.

It uses the Napoleon's Later Campaigns system, for a fast, low to moderate complexity, brigade-level game of Napoleonic battles.  Interactive Sequence of play, orders, and a modern, fire-based combat system (no odds optimising!).  To win, you have to use your army like a Napoleonic commander. Maintaining morale is the key. Running away will inspire defeatism in your troops just as heavy losses, but no side will emerge unscratched when encountering the enemy. Among all this you have to contend with multiple subordinates on a battlefield where no information can be sent faster than a rider can go.  How you are able to orchestrate your leaders to enable effective concentration of force will decide the battle.<br/><br/>The system combines a grand tactical perspective (battle strategy, not micromanagement) with a focus on a historically sound use of your units. Four pages of basic rules aim at an easy entry into the world of Napoleonic command and combined arms with four types of orders and assault combat, cavalry charges, and artillery bombardment. Nine pages of full rules add concepts such as additional order types, written orders (although markers are provided for those who do not wish to write), reaction charges, and enfilading fire.  Finally, 2 pages of Advanced and Optional rules add hidden movement, division level doctrine, and others.<br/><br/>The Salamanca special rules deal with particular units of the campaign (such as the British Light Division), reverse slope defense (used by the French in this battle!), and supply.  Scenarios cover the historical battle (playing time 2-3 hours between experienced players), and the full day (3-4 hours), enabling both sides to set the strategy for the battle as they choose.

Airborne employs a nonlinear gameplay style whereby the player can start the game anywhere in the map by directing where they land, as opposed to previous linear FPS games where the start point and direction is already laid out, such as Allied Assault.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Medal_of_Honor:_Airborne,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73609": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "BID-IT", "rpgdesigner": ["Mike Coe"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic751315.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "4", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["BID-IT Diceless Roleplaying"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic751315_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>User summary<br/><br/>The BID-IT rulebook contains generic rules for<br/><br/><br/>     Character creation<br/>     Diceless task resolution<br/>     Experience and character advancement<br/>     A damage system<br/><br/><br/>"}, "73610": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["MS Word Document"], "poll": [], "name": "Evolution: Gods at Play", "rpgdesigner": ["Hector Ren\u00e9 Segovia"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic751316.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "3", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Evolution: Gods at Play"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Weird / Surreal"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic751316_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>User summary<br/><br/>The Evolution: Gods at Play rulebook contains:<br/><br/><br/>     Rules for creating a species<br/>     An evolution and mutation system<br/>     Skill and combat tests<br/>     Adventure ideas<br/><br/><br/>"}, "73611": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Exemplar", "rpgdesigner": ["Jeffrey Schecter"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic751317.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Exemplar"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Occult (Psionics / Mentalism)", "Religion", "Science Fiction (Space Opera)", "War"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic751317_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>User summary<br/><br/>The Exemplar rulebook includes:<br/><br/><br/>     Setting information<br/>     Character creation and advancement rules<br/>     Task resolution and combat rules<br/>     Metaphysics<br/>     NPCs<br/>     Wraiths - an introductory adventure<br/><br/><br/>"}, "73612": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Lloyd Krassner"], "poll": [], "name": "Land of Industry", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Route/Network Building", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic754222_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Warp Spawn Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic754222.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Print and Play edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Industry / Manufacturing", "Print & Play", "Transportation"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "A board game of industrial growth in the 19th to early 20th century.

As an arcade flight game, it simplifies flight controls and gives the player a large amount of bullets, missiles and other weapons, putting them up against a very large amount of enemy forces. In addition to missiles and a vulcan cannon, the player can equip special weapons such as heat-seeking missiles, bombs, rocket launchers, and others. The player can lock on to a number of foes, and assist different tactical squads by switching between their respective HUD readouts.<br/><br/>The game includes 4 default multiplayer modes: Battle Royale, Siege Battle, Team Battle, and Co-Op Battle. In Battle Royale, the basic Deathmatch game mode, up to sixteen players shoot each other down to earn the highest points at the time limit. In Team Battle, a basic Team Deathmatch game is created. Points are awarded based on the type of aircraft destroyed. A unique type of multiplayer game, Siege Battle is played with two teams, Attacking and Defending. The Attacking team attempts to destroy the target (usually heavily defended by flak) within the time limit. The Defending team tries to halt their attack. The co-op battle mode consists of two single-player missions without AI that can be played with up to three other players.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Ace_Combat_6:_Fires_of_Liberation,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73647": {"poll": [], "name": "N3: Ninety-Nine Nights", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Italian Release", "US Xbox 360"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic752009.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Ninety-Nine Nights"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "16", "videogamedeveloper": ["Phantagram", "Q Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Beat 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Xbox 360"], "videogamehonor": ["2005 Japan Game Awards Best Unreleased Game Winner"], "average": "5.73438", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Microsoft Game Studios"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic752009_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;N3: Ninety-Nine Nights, (Korean: \ub098\uc778\ud2f0-\ub098\uc778 \ub098\uc774\uce20, Japanese: \u30ca\u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3 \u30ca\u30a4\u30f3 \u30ca\u30a4\u30c4), or simply Ninety-Nine Nights, is a fantasy hack and slash video game developed exclusively for the Xbox 360  by an alliance between Q Entertainment and Phantagram. Phantagram is a South Korean based developer noted for creating the Kingdom Under Fire series. Q Entertainment is a Japanese developer best known for its Lumines  and Meteos  series. Video game designer Tetsuya Mizuguchi served as producer for the game. The game features hundreds of enemies onscreen at any given time, and borrows heavily from other video games of the genre, most notably from the Dynasty Warriors and Kingdom Under Fire series'. The follow-up, Ninety-Nine Nights II, was officially unveiled at Microsoft's TGS 2008 press conference.<br/>In the struggle between light and dark, a new order is created after a mysterious power stone is destroyed. These two forces are destined to fight each other since the beginning of time, each one intending to retake control of everything. Will the side of light be the winner, or will the world once again undergo 99 nights of darkness?<br/><br/>The world of Ninety-Nine Nights has not always been an endless battlefield. There was a time when peace existed between all of the races. When a magical orb was shattered, light and dark entered the world, and a demon was born, this resulting in 99 nights of perpetual darkness. The Demon Lord led his army to take arms, but he was defeated on the one-hundredth day of battle by the Keeper of the Orb. The slain demon was named the King of Ninety Nine Nights after the months of darkness that their world endured. Peace was present, though ephemeral. Soon after, the Keeper of the Orb was murdered and the sacred orb was split in half. The humans took possession of the light shard, leaving the goblins with the dark shard.<br/><br/>In the divisive war, humans and goblins fought for what seemed like an endless amount of time. Tides turned in favor of the humans when the elves sided with them. But while the goblins retreated back into the forbidden forest of the lost, the Goblin King was making his own ally, the Lord of Darkness.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Ninety-Nine_Nights,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73648": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic752015.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Aliens", "Post-Apocalyptic", "Science Fiction"], "videogamegenre": ["Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows", "Xbox 360"], "poll": [], "videogamecompilation": ["Gears of War: Triple Pack"], "statistics": [], "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Xbox 360 edition", "Italian Windows edition", "Italian Xbox 360 edition", "North American Windows edition", "North American Xbox 360 (Platinum Hits) edition", "North American Xbox 360 edition", "Scandinavian Xbox 360 (Classics) edition", "UK Windows edition", "XBLA Xbox 360 Downloadable edition"], "videogamecharacter": ["Anya Stroud", "Augustus Cole", "Dominic Santiago", "Marcus Fenix"], "vgcharacterversion": ["Anya Stroud", "Augustus Cole", "Dominic Santiago", "Marcus Fenix"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic752015_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Gears of War is a third-person shooter video game developed by Epic Games and published by Microsoft Game Studios.

Despite the initial statements of Xbox 360 exclusivity, a Microsoft Windows version of the game was developed in conjunction with People Can Fly and released a year later, featuring new content including additional campaign levels, a new multiplayer game mode, and Games for Windows LIVE functionality.<br/><br/>The game focuses on the troops of Delta Squad as they fight to save the human inhabitants of the fictional planet Sera from a relentless subterranean enemy known as the Locust Horde. The player assumes the role of Marcus Fenix, a former prisoner and war-hardened soldier. The game is based on the use of cover and strategic fire for the player to advance through the scenarios; a second player can play cooperatively through the main campaign to assist. The game also features several online multiplayer game modes for up to eight players.<br/><br/>Gears of War sold over three million copies in just ten weeks and was the fastest-selling video game of 2006, and was the second-most played game over Xbox Live during 2007. The game has since sold over five million copies by September 2008. The game was well-received by critics, praising its gameplay and detailed visuals, and won several &quot;Game of the Year&quot; awards in 2006. The success of the game has led to the development of the Gears of War franchise, including the 2008 sequel Gears of War 2 and the upcoming sequel Gears of War 3 announced April 12, 2010, when Epic Games Cliff Bleszinski was a guest on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, with adaptations to books, comics, and a feature film also on the way.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Gears_of_War,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>", "videogameseries": ["Gears of War"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Epic Games"], "videogamehonor": ["2005 Game Critics Best Action Game of the Year Nominee", "2005 Game Critics Best Console Game of the Year Nominee", "2005 Game Critics Best of Show Nominee", "2006 Game Critics Best Action Game of the Year Winner", "2006 Game Critics Best Console Game of the Year Winner", "2006 Game Critics Best of Show Nominee", "2006 Game Critics Best Online Multiplayer of the Year Nominee", "2006 Game Critics Most Original Game of the Year Nominee", "2006 Spike Best Graphics of the Year Winner", "2006 Spike Best Multiplayer Game of the Year Winner", "2006 Spike Best Shooter of the Year Winner", "2006 Spike Game of the Year Nominee", "2006 Spike Most Addictive Game of the Year Nominee", "2007 D.I.C.E.

It is the second installment of the Gears of War series. The game expands technically on the previous game by using a heavily-modified Unreal Engine 3 engine. The development team also brought in comic book writer Joshua Ortega to help write the plot for the game.<br/><br/>In Gears of War 2, the human Coalition of Ordered Governments (COG) forces continue their fight against the Locust horde, who are attempting to sink all of the cities on the planet Sera by using a giant worm-like creature to eat the ground beneath them. Sergeant Marcus Fenix leads Delta Squad into the depths of the planet to try to stop the worm from eating but instead they discover the true intent of the Locust actions. The player controls Fenix in the main mission campaign, with the ability to play cooperatively with a second player controlling Fenix's best friend and fellow Squad member Dominic &quot;Dom&quot; Santiago. The game includes several existing and new multiplayer modes including five-on-five battles between human and Locust forces, and a &quot;Horde&quot; mode that challenges up to five players against waves of Locust forces with ever-increasing strength. New weapons and gameplay mechanics such as &quot;hockey fights&quot; and the ability to use downed foes as &quot;meatshields&quot; were added to the game.<br/><br/>On its release weekend, Gears of War 2 sold over two million copies, and within two months of release, had sold four million copies. It was the seventh best selling video game of 2008 and received several accolades. The game received similar praise as its predecessor, with the new gameplay and multiplayer modes seen as outstanding additions.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Gears_of_War_2,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73650": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Bernd Eisenstein"], "average": "6.36761", "poll": [], "name": "Porto Carthago", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Worker Placement"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "230", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic791285_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Oliver Schlemmer"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Irongames"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic791285.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English/German first edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Ancient"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "Carthage &ndash; long before the deadly conflict with Rome.<br/>During 5 decades, each a game round, players use their servants to earn income or position them to obtain goods and load the goods onto incoming merchant ships - or even take the risk of chartering a private vessel - all with the goal of buying influence in the palace.

It was the last version of Tiger Woods PGA Tour to be offered for the PC.<br/><br/>As of the North American launch, the game has been plagued with many bugs and technical problems, more notably with the Xbox 360 version. Known bugs include system &quot;freezing&quot; and crashing,<br/><br/>The PSP version also has a quite interesting glitch. In PGA tour mode, during a season, certain challenges become impossible to complete due to program errors. Most notably, during a challenge in which a golfer must master challenging shots from the rough, the avatar tees off from the top of a tree and the entire course is upside down. Regardless of how hard or straight the ball is hit, the result of any swing is an out of bounds shot, making it impossible to hole out in less than the 10 shot limit.<br/><br/>There are also reported problems with the uploading of pictures to the EA servers for the Photo Game Face feature.

The United Kingdom is subdued by Nazi Germany in 1940, and the rest of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East fall soon afterward. The United States, infected with anti-war sentiment, does not get involved overseas. The game takes place in the midst of the Greater German Reich's invasion and occupation of the east coast of the United States in 1953.<br/><br/>In Turning Point: Fall of Liberty, the player assumes the role of Dan Carson, an average New York construction worker who has no prior connection to the military. Unlike other similar war games, the player's objective is not to help the Allies win the war, but merely to survive in an environment of total war as a resistance fighter against Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>The game includes many advanced versions of weapons used in World War II, and several that were being researched and developed late in the war but never made it to mass production. Super-heavy tanks such as the Panzerkampfwagen VIII Maus and Landkreuzer P. 1000 Ratte appear in the game, as well as the Nachteule troop-transport zeppelin, the Flugzeugtr&auml;ger German aircraft carrier Graf Zeppelin, and various advanced jet fighters and bombers, all of which are utilized by the German invasion force.<br/><br/>The player can wield up to two weapons, which can be German or American. Weapons range from submachine guns to rifles to rocket launchers. He can also wield up to four grenades. When the player gets close to a Nazi soldier, a prompt comes up. Pressing the melee button when the prompt is seen allows two options to be taken. One is an instant kill, where Carson melees the Nazi soldier to death. The other is the human shield, where Carson knocks the Nazi soldier, holds him in a stranglehold, and takes his sidearm. He can walk around killing other Nazi soldiers with the human shield protecting him against most damages until his human shield dies. Occasionally, a Nazi soldier will be standing near an interactive object, such as a furnace or a toilet, allowing Carson to perform an environmental kill with it.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Turning_Point:_Fall_of_Liberty,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73655": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic758994.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jens Jahnke", "Britta St\u00f6ckmann"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Mariusz Gandzel", "Piotr Rorot", "Anna W\u0142odarska"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Igramoon Spieleverlag"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic758994_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Exploration", "Maze", "Transportation"], "boardgamehonor": ["2011 Essener Feder Best Written Rules Winner"], "description": "Sumatra - Island of many rare species<br/><br/>On behalf of the most famous zoological gardens of the Western World a few teams of big game hunters set out to the jungle of Sumatra to catch some nearly extinct species for the benefit of posterity.

The frontline mechanic is used in all gametypes, which forces players to choose which objectives they will pursue or defend, adding a strategic level to the gameplay.<br/><br/>The UCAV Drone plays a crucial role in gathering information in real time on the battlefield. The drone reconnoiters enemy units, which are visible through walls, and then show them on the player's HUD and map. Some drones can also be used as a kamikaze bomb, by running them into enemy infantry and self destructing them.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Frontlines:_Fuel_of_War,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73661": {"poll": [], "name": "NBA 2K8", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Italian XBox 360 Release"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic752046.jpg", "videogameseries": ["NBA 2K"], "videogametheme": ["Sports - Basketball"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "usersrated": "4", "videogamedeveloper": ["Visual Concepts Entertainment"], "videogamefranchise": ["NBA"], "videogameplatform": ["Xbox 360"], "videogamehonor": ["2007 Spike Best Sports Game of the Year Nominee", "2008 D.I.C.E.

Denied Ops is based around two CIA operatives, each having his own weapon and style: a sniper named Lincoln Graves who uses an SR-25 with an undermounted M26 MASS, and a machine gun operator named Reggie Lang who uses an M249 PARA with an undermounted M320 grenade launcher.  The two characters have quite opposite personalities. Lang likes it loud and noisy while Graves likes it quiet and stealthy.<br/><br/>In single player mode, the player can switch between controlling each operative.

A port to Macintosh was released on June 13, 2005. Eight expansion packs and nine stuff packs were subsequently released.<br/><br/>The Sims 2 has the same concept as its predecessor. Players control their Sims in various activities and forming relationships in a manner similar to real life. The Sims 2, like its predecessor, The Sims, does not have a defined final goal; gameplay is open-ended. Sims have life goals, wants and fears, the fulfillment of which can produce both positive or negative outcomes. All Sims age, and can live over 100 Sim days depending on the degree of which their aspirations are fulfilled. The Sims 2 builds on its predecessor by allowing Sims to age through six stages of life and incorporating a 3D graphics engine. Although gameplay is not linear, story-lines exist in the game's pre-built neighbourhoods. Pleasantview is based 25 years after the town in the original The Sims. Strangetown's storyline is based on the supernatural, and is loosely connected with Pleasantview. Veronaville's characters are based on Shakespearian characters.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The_Sims_2,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73687": {"rpgdesigner": ["C.

It is Midway's first game to use Unreal Engine 3, and was developed in collaboration with John Woo.<br/><br/>Stranglehold is the sequel to Woo's 1992 Hong Kong action film, Hard Boiled, and stars Chow Yun-Fat in a reprisal of his role as hard-boiled cop Inspector &quot;Tequila&quot; Yuen.Stranglehold is the first project on which Woo and Chow have collaborated since Hard Boiled.<br/><br/>Stranglehold attempts to translate the gun ballet aesthetic popularized by director John Woo, used in films such as Hard Boiled and The Killer, to an interactive media format. Although the game has drawn comparisons to Remedy Entertainment's Max Payne franchise, which was influenced by Woo,  a more accurate account of both games' creative provenances traces the games to Woo's lengthy, balletic shootouts.<br/><br/>During play, jumping in any direction or interacting with any object while aiming at an opponent (or pressing a certain button) will slow time, creating a short window during which Tequila can shoot at targets.  This technique - called Tequila Time - generates a cinematic effect that mimics Woo's. Tequila Time is managed through a meter which drains with use and regenerates with time. Tequila can also makes use of his environment, moving up and down railings, swinging from chandeliers, and sliding across tabletops and riding on carts while shooting at enemies.<br/><br/>Another form of gameplay comes from the style and grace associated with Woo's balletic firefights. By taking out enemies the player earns stars. The more stylish the kills peformed, the more stars received. Taking out enemies in quick succession, or interacting with the environment when taking down opponents, will earn the player the optimum amount of stars.
