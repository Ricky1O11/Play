You battle against your opponent by customizing your memory-lost characters by injecting various memories (words). Hence, the same character may be altered to execute different effects and abilities. First one to put your opponents' life to 0 wins the battle.<br/><br/>It's a Print and Play cardgame, supported by a custom website. A player can create a free account, and keep cards they gain on their personal page. Every 8 hours, each player receives a free Gacha giving a random card. But players can also buy a Premium Gacha giving five extra cards, including more rarites. Since the game is entirely PnP, buying cards is the only cost (an income model akin to mobile games) other than printing.<br/><br/>Gameplay is in quick 1 vs 1 deck-driven battles but the rules enable partnership games.

This is intentional, not a mistake.

While the players are visionary talented people, they try to help family Yates finding out what curse lies on them.<br/><br/>By connecting the family cards at the right time (represented by the clock cards) with their mental center the players gain victory points, visionary power and vision parts in different colors. Each player has got a vision card with a 3x3 pattern where they place the vision parts according to the rules. The players get victory points for full rows and columns.<br/><br/>The players may use the visionary power to change it into benefits, for example reducing the cost to connect family cards with the mental center or getting additional vision parts.<br/>At a given time the player with the fewest victory points decides which sort of visionary power will be blocked for the rest of the game. The benefits which were connected to this sort of visionary power are no longer available and all players have to deal with this limitation.<br/><br/>One family card lies at a special position and can't be connected directly with the mental center but it is possible to connect the card through the other family cards with the center to get the benefits.<br/><br/>The players also have to try to solve a master vision with the vision parts to get extra points and offer the best help for family Yates.

There are astronomical phenomena pieces (supernova, black hole and wormholes) and special actions (orbit, eclipse, hyperspace and dark energy). Finally, a cosmic clock will tick the passing of time and players&rsquo; turn.<br/><br/>Before the game starts, each player takes two hidden objective cards: a celestial body type and a colour. During the game the player has to manage to be the one who gets more victory points aligning 3 or more celestial bodies consecutively of their own type or colour.<br/><br/>The game starts in the moment 0 of the universe, 13.700 million years ago, placing the first piece: the Big Bang!<br/><br/>In a turn, the player has to place one of the 4 available pieces below the cosmic clock. Two rules are mandatory to place a piece in the universe:<br/><br/>&mdash; The piece has to be adjacent at least with 2 pieces and at least one of them has to be a celestial body.<br/><br/>&mdash; The celestial body has to have a common characteristic with all the adjacent celestial bodies: same type, same colour or same background.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLACE THE PIECES<br/><br/>The Earth is a wild card that is equivalent to any other celestial body type, colour or background.<br/><br/>The universe can be altered placing some of the 3 astronomical phenomena:<br/><br/>Black hole<br/>A big star that collapses and absorbs all the celestial bodies around it. In the game, the celestial bodies are turned over, with a great destructive potential of alignments.<br/>Supernova: a medium size star that explodes releasing matter and energy giving extra turns of additional celestial bodies for each adjacent piece placed next to the supernova.<br/>Wormhole: alignments or celestial bodies that are very far in the universe can be connected through these two pieces of the tunnel end or portal.<br/>The player can also use 4 special actions that affects only celestial bodies. These actions can be used to amend, create or even destroy alignments:<br/><br/>Eclipse<br/>a celestial body can hide another celestial body by placing it over.<br/><br/>Orbit<br/>a celestial body can be moved following an orbit path around another adjacent celestial body.<br/>Hyperspace: a celestial body can be moved at the speed of light to the other side of the universe.<br/><br/>Dark energy<br/>the universe expansion can be accelerated and the alignment formation too, by placing two new celestial bodies in the same turn skipping the rule of placing adjacent to at least two pieces.<br/>The space-time relationship is very important in the real universe and in the game. Each piece placed in the universe has a duration or cost in millions of years, between 1 and 5 millions years according to its value. Each player pawn will be moved forward in the cosmic clock every time they place a new piece in the universe. The game is not following circular turns, because the turn always belongs to the player who is most behind, so has invested less million of years in placing pieces in the universe.<br/>Clock<br/><br/>Once the game runs out of available pieces and all of them are placed in the universe, the game is over. The players will show their objective cards and will count their victory points based on the alignments according to their two objective cards. The winner is who has most points. In case of a tie, the winner is who is the most behind in the cosmic clock, so has invested less millions of years in pieces.<br/><br/>"}, "225527": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Will Donovan"], "poll": [], "name": "Folklore: the Affliction \u2013 Colossal Dark Oak Miniature Pack", "boardgameartist": ["Jason Engle", "Henning Ludvigsen"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3530063.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "boardgameaccessory": ["Folklore: The Affliction"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Greenbrier Games", "Twin Fire Productions, LLC"], "bgaccessoryversion": ["English first edition"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3530063_t.png", "description": "This miniature is an exclusive model, about 50mm tall, only available through the Kickstarter or Pledge Manager, or possibly at game conventions and the Greenbrier online webstore for a limited time.<br/><br/>"}, "225528": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Scott Wayne Indiana"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "name": "Lotus Dimension", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Role Playing", "Storytelling"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Alexander Wilds Cunningham", "Scott Wayne Indiana"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "boardgameversion": ["Lotus Dimension"], "maxplaytime": "0", "poll": [], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Lotus Dimension is a tabletop role-playing game (RPG).<br/><br/>Players have to solve all the challenges the <br/>game thrown at them using nonviolent means?<br/>What if a game drew on amazing sci-fi and fantasy storytelling while also incorporating principles of nonviolence inspired by peaceful protests, historical leaders and the tenets of peaceful philosophical practices?<br/><br/>And what if it offered players a way to visualize and role-play solutions to wildly imagined problems, responding to and replacing violence and weaponry with empathy and ingenuity?<br/><br/>"}, "225529": {"rpgdesigner": ["Steve Bean", "Daniel J.

Were two such universes ever to touch, their likely-incompatible physics would tear each other apart in much the same way as an encounter between a paladin and an anti-paladin. That is to say, one may survive the encounter, but neither are going to look happy when it&rsquo;s over. In order to prevent this from happening, the ether absorbs the excess translational energy of the entire multiverse, which, in turn, makes it the greatest source of raw energy there is. Mind you, this means the greatest source of energy in the multiverse can be accurately described as a vat of gelatin studded with universes as though they were bits of pineapple.<br/><br/>Not by study, not by blood, but by sheer, dumb luck, a mortal can find himself attuned to the limitless well that is the ether. As an infinite gift with no apparent source or rationale has a tendency to be construed as divine mandate, the vast majority of ethermages are insufferable louts, though some few take their gift and use it for nobler deeds.<br/><br/>How does the ether play?<br/><br/>Ultimate Ethermagic takes equal parts Douglas Adams and H. P. Lovecraft to produce an &ldquo;all day long&rdquo; system of magic with a cosmic flavor. Spiritual successors to the warlock base class of the 3.5 days, ethermagic classes seek to have improved playability by offering the ability to mix and match spell effects to make custom evocations on the fly. Whereas the warlock simply blasted, the ethermagician can ask, &ldquo;How hard?&rdquo;<br/><br/>Thanks to the advent of a rapidly-regenerating spell point pool, players must choose whether or not to spend more than they will regenerate next turn. Incredibly potent effects are indeed possible, but firing them off without a care in the world will reduce the player to single-target ranged touch attacks in a hurry!<br/><br/>Ethermagic Expanded - The Ethershaper Base Class introduces a new advanced play base class to the ethermagic canon: the ethershaper. Sole user of the new voidshape etherheart (basically a school of magic), the ethershaper combines damage, support, and debilitating effects that can be woven into single spells, but then applies them based on the target&rsquo;s initiative score at the time. Combined with limited initiative manipulation to allow a single spell to buff one target and deal damage to another, this makes the ethershaper more combo-oriented than any other extant ethermagic class, and as initiative scores will be different for every combat, new combos will need to be created for each fight.<br/><br/>Product Features<br/><br/>    The ethershaper base class<br/>    The herald of the self archetype, which adds chaos magic to the mix<br/>    The new voidshape etherheart with 70+ manifestations<br/>    A reprint of the alteration (self buff), bestow (other buff/debuff), and genesis (conjuration) etherhearts, including all manifestations.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "225545": {"rpgdesigner": ["Maria Smolina"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Avalon Haunts 09", "rpgartist": ["Lord Zsezse Works"], "rpgproducer": ["Robert Hemminger"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3514071.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Horror"], "rpgpublisher": ["Avalon Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Avalon Haunts"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3514071_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Need something a bit scary for your game?

Ireland would rise, he insisted, if France would only lend its support. That year, a force of 14,000 Frenchmen on 43 ships evaded the British fleet and sailed into Bantry Bay, Cork County, Ireland where rough weather forced them to abandon their operation and return to France.<br/><br/>Two years and three audiences with Napoleon later, Tone tried again. Three waves of French landings were planned to coordinate with a general rising of the United Irishmen (Protestant and Catholic alike) all across the island. Unfortunately, word leaked and key leaders were arrested in Dublin, triggering an early rising, quickly and brutally put down by a combination of professional troops, recently raised fencibles, local militia and orange order yeomen. The rebellion staggered on through September but only in County Wexford and later in County Mayo with minimal French support, did the rebellion meet with any success.<br/><br/>As for the French, the first wave of 1100 men under the able command of Jean Humbert, stormed ashore in County Mayo in August, 1798. A smaller force landed in Donegal in September under the command of Napper Tandy. Humbert enjoyed a few successes but soon surrendered to the overwhelming force Lord Cornwallis brought to bear. Soon after, Tandy abandoned the Emerald Isle when he realized he could no longer be of service to Humbert. A month later and further North off the coast of Donegal, a second wave of 3000 men under Jean Hardy and Wolfe Tone himself met with disaster.  Hardy&rsquo;s fleet ran afoul of the British fleet and Tone was captured. Imprisoned and condemned to hang, Tone committed suicide. The third and largest wave of French soldiers never sailed.<br/><br/>Without determined French support the Irish rebellion of 1798 stood little chance of success. Historically it was a bloody great uncoordinated fiasco made worse by the early demise of Tone&rsquo;s benefactor, General Hoche to consumption. History might have been different if the stars had aligned, if those key Irish leaders had not been captured and their plans revealed, if the rebels had received a sizeable number of French and British arms, if Hoche had survived. If a second and even a third wave of French regulars had landed, and if those French regulars had landed while the rebellion was still vibrant, then &ndash; then, as WOLFE TONE&rsquo;S RISING reveals, England would have had a serious problem.<br/><br/>WOLFE TONE&rsquo;S RISING puts the aforementioned what-ifs into play. A short game of seven turns pits English regulars and loyalist militia against the Irish rebels and their French allies. Here, the French play a shell game with the British attempting to land troops in Ireland not once but three times. Here, unknown morale plays a vital role to the outcome of every battle. Here, Local leaders are not cookie cut-outs but individuals who enjoy unique abilities in battle. And here, each battle is assisted by a battle board utilizing fresh mechanics that make each battle a mini-game unto itself.  A note on the leaders used: British and French leaders are key historical leaders, whereas Irish rebel leaders are largely representational.  Anonymous loyalist leaders represent a mixture of militia and yeomen. Loyalist hierarchy was either nonexistent or too confusing to identify specific names.<br/><br/>"}, "225571": {"poll": [], "name": "Piraci: Karaibska flota \u2013 Atak Hiszpan\u00f3w", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2012", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1372020_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Egmont Polska"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1372020.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Polish first edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Pirates"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Can be used on any round and is put out of the game thereafter.<br/><br/>After bidding, the winner of the bidding puts entire sum to the bank.

But they must be quick, determined and lucky to get the treasures before a rival pirate grabs it.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>Cards:<br/>There is a scoring card and eight adventure cards in the game. Each adventure card has 3 requirements/steps for a ship to travel along.  If the dice rolled meet the requirements, than a ship can go on an adventure always beginning from the bottom most part of the card.  For a ship to advance further on an adventure card, the dice always must match the next requirement to keep on travelling.  A ship can at any time during the player's turn abandon the adventure it is on and return to the player&rsquo;s ship pool. Most of the requirements/steps have a certain amount of loot the player can grab in the left side of the card. Whenever a player ever grabs the loot from the space they are on, the ship is returned in the player&rsquo;s pool and an unused card is placed in such a way that the amount of loot taken is covered to indicate it is exhausted. <br/>There are 3 levels of cards:  Level 1 &ndash; Adventures with  0 / 2 / 3 loot x3 Level 2 - Adventures with   2 / 3 / 5 loot x3 Level 3 - Adventures with  4 / 6 / 10 loot x2<br/> Setup:<br/>Every player gets their colored tokens (ships) of choice and make a ships pool in front of them and also a score tracker cube and put them near the scoring card.<br/>Shuffle the Level 1 cards separately from Level 2 and Level 3 and make 2 little decks. <br/>In a 2-player game turn face up in the middle of the table two (2) cards from the Level 1 deck and two (2) cards from the Level 2-3 deck.

Rest of the game is played clockwise.<br/> Gameplay: (consists of 3 phases for the current active player)<br/>1.  Loot Phase:<br/>Before the rolling phase the ships that have travelled in previous rounds can grab the loot from the requirement/step they are on.<br/>When the loot is grabbed, the ship is returned in the player's ships pool and an unused card is placed in such a way that this amount of loot printed on the card is covered to indicate it is exhausted.<br/>If 2 or more ships are on the same step the loot is split between them rounded down. If the loot is the highest one at that time on the card, than it is split and taken immediately by all the players.<br/>If there is a higher step that can be accomplished the non-active player decided if he wants to take his cut from the loot or keep his ship on the step it is on and let the active player take the whole loot.<br/>When the last available loot is grabbed from an adventure card, all ships on this card returned to players' ships pools and the card is turned face down and is inaccessible. <br/>2. Rolling Phase:<br/>The current player gets the 5 dice and rolls them.<br/>Then he decides if he wants to keep some or all of the current dice results and/or he may reroll any combination of dice twice.<br/>The last reroll dice results must be kept as there are.<br/>The smallest combination that can be used for a requirement is of at least 2 dice*.<br/><br/>    For the &ldquo;no even dice&rdquo; and &ldquo;no odd dice&rdquo; steps in the Level 2 cards all unused dice of this round are used to fulfill this requirement.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>3.

These actions set the stage for the Wehrmacht&rsquo;s autumn drive on the Soviet capital, and many historians believe the bitter fighting here ultimately doomed the Axis to failure in Russia.<br/><br/>The game begins on 8 July with Barbarossa still in high gear. In August, the advance stalls as Hitler diverts most of the panzers from the map to forces around Leningrad and Kiev. Soviet counteroffensives will push Army Group Center close to the breaking point by game&rsquo;s end on 8 September. The asymmetry of the two armies will be familiar to veterans of past OCS campaigns, especially Guderian&rsquo;s Blitzkrieg II. There is the expected qualitative difference in typical Action Ratings, along with stark contrasts in logistical capabilities and replacement rates. There also some unique twists in the situation, including:<br/><br/><br/>     Three of the panzer divisions are getting their first taste of combat, so their Action Ratings are reduced.<br/>     The rivalry between Heinz Guderian and Hermann Hoth makes it difficult for these generals to coordinate their panzer armies, and might prevent the ring from closing around Smolensk.<br/>     Soviet tank divisions are shown for the first time. They pack a wallop, but their quality leaves a lot to be desired.<br/>     The Soviet 1st Motorized Division is presented as a somewhat elite multi-unit formation that includes some heavy KV-1s and T-34s.<br/>     The contributions of small militia, tank, and anti-tank units are reflected by the Soviet Alarm Pool.<br/>     Other chrome accounts for &lsquo;tree bark soup&rsquo; (used by cut-off units), planes diverted to terror-bomb Moscow, and special markers for artillery ammo &amp; katyusha effects.<br/><br/><br/>Smolensk is a small and fairly simple entry in the series, with special rules kept to a minimum.

The people are left to pick up the pieces and rebuild their civilizations. However, vicious gangs that prey on these defenseless citizens are obstructing the reconstruction.<br/><br/>The main protagonists are Boris, Wade and Kyle, vigilantes who protect the feared and helpless. Their largest problem is the corrupt, incorrigible, ruthless and lethal gang known as &quot;The Geld Gang&quot;. They have commissioned every type of person imaginable. Purple-haired, leather-clad, chain-wielding, lead-pipe swinging, masked, martial art, orange-mohawked and men so strong and immune to pain they use manhole covers as shields.<br/><br/>One day, when the trio is patrolling the streets, alert, ready and able to help those in need, they see a woman named Sheena (a friend of theirs) waving at them walking across the street out of a supermarket with groceries. A moment later, Lord Geld's right-hand man, Red Freddy, snatches her away while riding on his purple hog. Now, the three braves must save Sheena from the grips of Lord Geld.<br/><br/>In Violent Storm, up to three players can choose between Wade, Boris and Kyle, who have different fighting styles, speed and moves, some of which are hidden. Players must guide them through 7 different stages, in order of appearance: a declined town, a runaway train, in the taverns with trap doors, inside a metal furnacery, a botanic garden, a bay area near the sea and finally Lord Geld's museum. Along the way, if the players clash any enemy, they will wallop, sock, pommel, whip and slug against the players, sometimes with weapons like knives, lead pipes, bombs, bolts of electricity, spiked balls on chains, garbage cans, vise grips, molten metal and a myriad of other deadly armament.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Storm Violent Storm]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "225672": {"rpgdesigner": ["Marcus Bone", "Colin Chapman", "Olivier Legrand", "Luke G.

Here&rsquo;s a quick overview of how the system works. <br/>There When You Need It<br/><br/>Most of the time, you can use the context of the story and established abilities of the characters to decide what happens without having to roll any dice. Do what makes sense, seems logical, and makes for an interesting story. There are only two times when you need to roll dice:<br/><br/>The outcome is uncertain. The action that a character wants to undertake could succeed or fail, so you roll dice to find out which. Or, there are risks inherent in undertaking the action, so you roll to see if the character succeeds and overcomes those risks, or fails and has to deal with the complications.<br/><br/>You need to determine the degree of success or failure. You know that the character will probably succeed, but how well they manage to do so will matter. Or, even though you know the character will probably fail, the degree to which they fail holds some significance. The rewards and complications can impact the story going forward, so die rolls are required to help better define the outcomes.<br/>Bid on Risks and Rewards<br/><br/>When you decide what action you&rsquo;d like your character to take, you bid a die type (d4, d6, d8, d10, or d12). This represents both the risk you&rsquo;re willing to take and the reward you&rsquo;d like to achieve. The bigger the die, the greater the degree of success or failure. The more the character stands to gain if you succeed, the greater the injury or other complications the character will suffer if you fail.<br/>Roll a d20 and Add Modifiers<br/><br/>The player declares what they&rsquo;d like the character to do, and then rolls a 20-sided die. Add any bonuses the character is able to use, as well as any situational modifiers that the guide might impose, to the rolled result. There are no target numbers to compare the total to; all you need to keep track of is whether the total of the roll and modifiers is high or low, even or odd.<br/>High or Low, Success or Failure<br/><br/>If the total of your roll plus modifiers is high (11 or more) your character succeeds. If your total is low (10 or less) you character fails. That&rsquo;s it. No charts, no tables, and no screen are required to figure out whether your character succeeded or failed. You can focus on the story, not the dice.<br/>Even or Odd, Narrating the Outcome<br/><br/>If your total of roll plus modifiers is an even number, you get to describe what happens. If your total is an odd number, the guide describes what happens. You can make your successes sound far more impressive, and your failures less painful. The guide can make your victories look like luck, and your failures look embarrassing.<br/>Nobody Dies Accidentally<br/><br/>Because Lighthouse leans toward being a storytelling activity and away from being a game, it&rsquo;s impossible for characters to simply die randomly because of bad die rolls or even poor choices. A character&rsquo;s death has to make sense in the context of the story. It should also have emotional impact, as it does in fiction. Finally, the player and the guide have to agree that the character&rsquo;s death is appropriate and adds something interesting or important to the story.<br/><br/>"}, "225687": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jason Morningstar"], "rpg": ["First Ride / Last Ride"], "statistics": [], "name": "First Ride / Last Ride", "rpgartist": ["Jason Morningstar"], "rpgproducer": ["Jason Morningstar"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "rpggenre": ["Modern (Pop Culture)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Bully Pulpit Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "description": "From the publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>FIRST RIDE / LAST RIDE is a short but intense one-player role-playing game about living on the edge, pulling heists and driving high performance cars in illegal street races.

But to achieve that we need to cast our troops in our invocation line (first line)and cross with them all the battlefield, fighting enemy troops to reach their lines and &quot;hit&quot; them equal to our troops ATK value. As said, 20 points means victory. The fact troops need to move makes them have an unusual basic value: they have ATTACK/LIFE and SPEED (number of zones -cells- they can run in a turn).<br/><br/>But troops, objects and the rest of cards aren't played for free.

This applies equally well to art and music, science, medicine and engineering. The Enlightenment was advanced chiefly through royal patronage. Inclusion of the art elements underscores the contrast between rationalism (science, medicine) and intellectual aesthetics (Bach and Rameau in music, and classical art), on the one hand, and Rousseau and the radical&rsquo;s enshrinement of the &quot;simple life&quot; and its disdain for science and institutions of learning (Rousseau&rsquo;s First Discourse). The issue here culminates in a debate over whether the royal academies&mdash;which had generated advances in all branches of human endeavor&mdash;should be shut down and replaced by more democratic (and perhaps less intellectually elite) institutions.<br/><br/>A second issue concerns gender. The central role of women as Section Leaders surfaces intermittently in the game, but the Salon of 1791 brings the issue to the fore in a vivid way: should women be admitted to the painting academies? Forward-thinking noblemen and noblewomen were often visible as patrons and actual workers in the arts and sciences; by contrast, David, a Jacobin leader, insists, with Rousseau, that women focus on their &ldquo;proper&rdquo; roles in rearing virtuous citizens. In short, conservatives accept a measure of women&rsquo;s liberation; the Jacobins do not. Inclusion of the female Section Leader, who seeks to promote her sister&rsquo;s career as painter, generates friction between the Jacobins and female Section Leaders&mdash;foreshadowing a later phase of the revolution.<br/><br/>A third issue concerns the role of art as form of political activism. Many proponents of art claim that some forms of art can encourage people to look at familiar problems in new ways; art thus promotes activism. Jacques-Louis David was arguably one of the first of the activist artists.<br/><br/>"}, "225716": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Appendix N: Rules for Dueling", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3518179.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["History (Europe)", "Politics / Government"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpg": ["Rousseau, Burke, and Revolution in France, 1791"], "rpgcategory": ["Alternate Rules (Variant Core Rules)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3518179_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>Because in history several key figures in the National Assembly participated in duels, the game allows this component.

Collect pigments to craft brilliant paints and use those paints to paint the greatest artworks of the High Renaissance. Get critiqued, build your portfolio, and exhibit your work to become the most prestigious artist of the period!<br/><br/><br/>    It's your turn*<br/><br/><br/>On your turn, if you haven&rsquo;t started an artwork, you may select one from the gallery and move it to your easel, indicating that artwork is in progress. Now, only you can complete it. Next, use sets of pigments from your hand to produce paint, discarding the requisite cards indicated in the recipe area on the paint card. Move your new paint from the palette to your hand or place it on your easel, dedicating it to that artwork.<br/><br/>Each artwork requires a specific set of paints. When you have gathered them, in hand or on the easel, it&rsquo;s time to submit your artwork for a critique. Roll the critique die; if the value of equal or higher to the prestige value of the artwork, you have successfully completed it! Move the artwork, along with all paints used to complete it, to the table, clearing your easel for your next artwork. If your roll came up short, take a feedback token indicating you&rsquo;ve received useful advice from the critique. This token makes future critique attempts easier. Each subsequent artwork makes future critiques slightly easier, representing the artist&rsquo;s growing popularity.<br/><br/>All 24 artwork cards award prestige points, with addition prestige earned by participating in exhibitions. Exhibits award prestige points when players complete sets of artwork cards; such as: &lsquo;Leonardo Exhibit&rsquo; (two artworks from Leonardo da Vinci) and &lsquo;Portrait Exhibit&rsquo; (artworks featuring portrait images). Masterwork includes 16 exhibit cards, with a random set of three used each game, offering a great deal of replayability.<br/><br/><br/>    Ending and scoring*<br/><br/><br/>When a player completes a gold-edged Masterwork Artwork card, finish the current round so each player has an equal number of turns (the player to the right of the starting player gets the final play). Each player adds up the Prestige Points from their completed Artwork cards. The three Exhibit cards are evaluated one after another for each player, comparing their completed Artwork cards with the requirements of cards. For each completed Exhibit card, add the indicated Prestige Point value to the Player&rsquo;s total.

The first scenario pits two inexperienced German panzer brigades against a confident and veteran Combat Command A. The German side has more armor, including the superior Panther tank, and the poor weather generally favors them, but the American side has more artillery as well as better tactics and leadership. The second scenario pits the experienced German 11th Panzer Division against Combat Command A and the newly arrived Combat Command B, now hampered by restricted fuel supplies. In each scenario both players will be challenged to determine whether it is better to simply attack, or spend valuable time attempting to maneuver in continually changing weather conditions before attacking.

StrongSword places you at the head of a mob of ferocious frothing fighters, be that a large or small mob of them!<br/><br/>The style of play is quite straightforward, but the real challenge is working out how to use the simple rules to command your warriors in battle as effectively as possible. This is because, although all of your models act independently from one another, your whole force is guided by the single tactic or &lsquo;Battle Stance&rsquo; you set each turn.<br/><br/>Your Battle Stance is a simple order that&rsquo;s either shouted by leaders over the tumult of battle, indicated by flag waving, horn blowing, or similar battlefield communication. It tells each of your warriors how to act this turn &ndash; maybe they&rsquo;ll be ordered to be defensive, or aggressive, stand back to catch their breath, or go completely nutty and charge at the nearest living enemy.<br/><br/>The key focus of commanding your warband in this arena of mob warfare is that you must choose the single Battle Stance that strengthens to your current situation &ndash; you can&rsquo;t go giving differing, complex orders to different warriors under your command because you&rsquo;re too busy fighting and simply don&rsquo;t have that luxury of time. Instead, shout your commands as loudly as you&rsquo;re able to and let your warriors do their best!<br/><br/>Combat and morale is kept pretty simple, as are the spells you can cast.

This game challenges both players: The Spanish must struggle to coordinate the actions of their large and enthusiastic but mostly untrained army, while the French must decide whether to try and hold against superior numbers or conduct a fighting withdrawal back to Madrid. With Spanish guerrillas, a baggage train full of looted treasure, and treacherous Swiss mercenaries who might change sides in the middle of the battle, Bail&eacute;n 20 offers players plenty of military adventure.<br/><br/>Considered one of Wellington&rsquo;s finest battles, Arapiles 20 (July, 1812) from Lance McMillan focuses on the hard-fought meeting engagement between his veteran British forces and Mareschal Marmont&rsquo;s French army in the hills south of Salamanca. With two armies of equal strength, victory requires careful planning, precise maneuvers, and exact timing to take advantage of the opportunities offered by unexpected events. Will the British player be able to pounce on a fleeting French blunder to win the day (as happened historically), or will the French be able to simply bludgeon his opponent into submission? In Arapiles 20, the outcome of this famous battle is in your hands.<br/><br/>Rudi Garcia's Talavera 20 recreates the major battle which occurred near the city of Talavera de la Reina on 27 to 28 July 1809. One player commands the French army under Napoleon's brother, Joseph, the self-proclaimed King of Spain, and the other commands the combined allied armies of Great Britain (under Sir Arthur Wellesley) and Spain (under Captain-General Gregorio de la Cuesta). After his attempt to liberate Madrid from the French was repulsed, Cuesta's army fell back to Talavera, which was covered by the British. Starting with a daring night attack, Joseph repeatedly attempted to push the allies out of their superb defensive positions, to no avail. As the French, can you find and exploit a weak spot in the allied lines? As the allies, can you hold your shaky alliance together and fend off the French (all the while keeping a nervous eye out for a second French army that might unexpectedly show up behind your armies)?<br/><br/>Bussaco 20: Second Edition, from designer Lance McMillan, features the battle occurring on 26 September 1810, during the early stages of the French invasion of Portugal.
