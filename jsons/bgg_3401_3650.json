This is Crescendo of Doom... a gripping game of tactical combat set against the seemingly invincible juggernauts of war-torn Europe. Setting the scene for the colossal struggle of the titans which will follow, Crescendo is, nonetheless, far more than a simple prelude to Barbarossa. While fur&shy;ther refining the innovations brought forth in its highly successful predecessors Squad Leader and Cross of Iron, Crescendo breaks yet even more ground in the realm of realistic tactical combat without disturbing the underlying basic simplicity of a universally acclaimed game system.

Complete armor, ordnance, and infantry units are provided for Poland, Belgium, Finland. and a host of other minor neutrals including Elite, Line, and Reservist formations for all nationalities. In graphic detail far superior to any narrative account, you will see for yourself how the outnumbered German panzers defeated the superior armor of the French tanks.

As an expansion, much of the 1984 edition of Axis &amp; Allies was needed to play this expansion.<br/><br/>The World at War 1939-1945 2nd Edition, published in 1993, balanced some of the gameplay and added some new ideas but retained the same glossy 24&quot;x36&quot; color map and pieces.<br/><br/>The 3rd Edition, published in 1996, continued to improve gameplay balance and added Atomic Bombs to the technology development. After developing A-bomb technology, players spend 6 IPCs to buy one, which must be delivered via a Heavy Bomber (also a required technology). Damage to a land or sea zone by an A-bomb eliminates 20 IPCs worth of enemy units and renders the territory desolate (-5 IPC value, with +1 restoration each turn for two turns), causing devastation to the economy as well as military of an opposing player.<br/><br/>Now in its 4th edition, The World at War includes a hardback map (replacing the poster-paper map of earlier editions), with some minor rule revisions over the 3rd ed, and this is a mature game in it's own right with differences significant enough for any A&amp;A fan to appreciate, beyond all of the &quot;official&quot; editions published in recent years.<br/><br/>There are new unit types, such as Destoyers, Paratroopers, SS Panzers and SS Panzergrenadiers, Russian Guards, Partisans.

After the first segment of a turn, only towers made of two game pieces may be moved. Each tower is broken down during its move, and one of its pieces may be used to build a new tower on another square. Intelligent use of this move technique can lead to &quot;nuclear chain reactions&quot;, in which up to five towers are involved. There must never be more than one tower on the board at one time. Any tower on the board must be moved during the following turn segment by the player whose piece is on top. The game ends with the achievement of an agreed-upon number of points.<br/><br/>The game was originally published in 1989 in a tiny cardboard box by Ferdinand de Cassan.

It is packaged in a slipcase box that includes one 60 x 52 cm map, 240 full-color die cut counters, one standard and scenario rules booklet, one historical commentary booklet, and two player aid cards.  Game turns are one year each: after collecting silver and/or receiving it from Rome, you can pay your troops, recruit tribal levies, and perform other administrative functions. After that comes the Operations Phase. During it, each force (one or more Field Armies, Tribal Levies, etc) can perform certain operations, using Operation Points (OP). These actions include combat, diplomacy (you can try to control any area through diplomacy), besiege cities, pillage, recruit mercenaries, or build colonies. At the end of the Operations Phase, forces retire to winter quarters.<br/><br/>The most outstanding features of the game are the Prestige Point Level and the differences between Regular and Irregular warfare.  The Prestige Level (PP) simulates the prestige of the civilized armies (Punic, Romans, Sertorians) among the Iberian tribes, and the tendency of the latter to switch to the side that seems to be winning... Certain results of the CRTs add or decrease the PP level of each side. Then, if your PP level is above 2, you have positive die roll modifiers on the Diplomacy Table. And vice versa if your PP level is 0 or lower.  Leaders play a key role since their modifiers are applied to retreat before combat, diplomacy, all kinds of combat, operations, interception, etc. Leaders are rated for Military and Diplomatic skills (The highest is Sertorius, with +3 +3). Roman leaders (Praetors, one each for Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior) are changed randomly each year when they're elected by the Senate of Rome. If you have quality leaders, your chances of avoid/provoke combat are higher, and vice versa.<br/><br/>The irregular, &quot;hit and run&quot; tactics of the inhabitants of the peninsula characterized the Roman conquest and were the cause why the Romans took 200 years to completely control all of Hispania. All combat units have Regular and Irregular Combat factors. The attacker can always choose which CRT he is going to use. The idea here was to simulate the asymmetrical war fought out between the Roman/Punic invaders and the native peoples. If you can impose your style of fighting, (the other can not avoid combat) then you have the edge over the enemy.<br/><br/>The game is played in scenarios. There are 9, from the Punic reconquest of Iberia (237-221 BCE) to the Cantabria campaigns of Caesar Augustus (24-19 BCE). There are a set of common rules for all the scenarios, plus specific rules for each scenario. There are fast playing scenarios (such as the Roman Civil War, or the Cantabrian wars) that can be played in two-three hours, and other that take 6-10 hour of play (up to 17 turns, such as Cato's campaign of 195 BCE, or the II Lusitanian War).<br/><br/>Each scenario has its own Random Events Table. Some of the Random Events included are: plague, Excellent/Bad Crops, Tribal Rebellions galore, bribing enemy mercenaries, Numidian rebellion (for the II Punic War scenario), Alliance with Mithridates (Sertorius War scenario), and more.<br/><br/>Optional rules include assassination of enemy leaders (you must spend Operations Points and Treasury Points for that), Rivalry between Iberian tribes (The Romans took advantage of this to apply the &quot;divide and conquer&quot; routine), Mountain redoubts (Mons Vidius, Mons Medulius...), or troop upgrade.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"85657": "First edition"}, "average": "6.04268", "name": "Iberos", "playingtime": "360", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "41", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5606": "Ancient Rome"}}, "3635": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3196867.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1993", "maxplayers": "6", "age": "12", "boardgamepublisher": {"328": {"name": "Horn Abbot Ltd."}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3196867_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Trivial Pursuit's Country Music edition.

Take their pieces, control the board, dominate the elements, win the game.  Are you up to it?<br/><br/>Elemental has no set up time and you can teach a friend the rules of play in just 10 minutes (in fact, all the moves are printed right on the board).  Like all great games, the rules are simple but the complex strategies are limited only by your creativity and resourcefulness.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/>11&times;11 inch Full Color Game Board<br/>4 Full Color Reference cards<br/>Scads of double-sided full color playing pieces<br/>rules of Play Card<br/>Storage Bag<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     CCG Workshop (no longer available)<br/><br/><br/>"}, "3645": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic12168.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"38217": {"name": "The Overrunning of the West"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1479": {"name": "Nick Schuessler"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1985", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamepublisher": {"352": {"name": "Task Force Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "360", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic12168_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "360", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "description": "Planned to be a nine-part series of games covering all of WWII based on the B.H.

It is the first in the GMT Musket &amp; Pike Battle System covering warfare in the 17th Century. The system emphasizes Command and Control and the unique style of combat in that era. Armies are divided into three of four wings. Each wing has an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Wings may change their order, but it is not an easy task to accomplish. Victory goes to the commander who can coordinate the actions of these wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry brigades, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries. Rules include Cavalry Charges, use of the Cavalry's pistols to skirmish or use in close combat, artillery grazing fire, Infantry techniques of fire including advancing, retreating, and salvo firing. Play is highly interactive, and a battle can be played through in one sitting.<br/><br/>The battles included in this game are:<br/><br/>Edgehill, 23 October 1642<br/>    Is the King beholden to Parliament or is he truly sovereign? King Charles and his army, their way to London barred by the army of Parliament, have drawn up to give battle. Edgehill was the first major battle of the war. Robert Devereax, Earl of Essex, commands the army of Parliament sent to prevent the King's army from reaching London. The fighting is indecisive as the bloodied Royalist foot fall back, but Essex conceded the field despite receiving reinforcements. A major victory for either side could have ended the war here.<br/><br/>First Newbury, 20 September 1643<br/>    Outmaneuvered, Essex, with the Royalists under King Charles between his army and London, is forced to fight. Essex spies a hill southwest of Newbury and in the early morning occupies it. Hedges line the area and help minimize the King's advantage in Cavalry.<br/><br/>Marston Moor, 2 July 1644<br/>    The largest battle of the war. It decided the fate of Northern England. An allied army of Scots under the Earl of Leven, the Northern Association under Ferdinando Fairfax, and the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester laid siege to the King's Northern Army under the Marquis of Newcastle at York, the key to the North. King Charles dispatched his nephew, the talented Prince Rupert, to effect a relief. The defeat was complete; the Royalist army was utterly destroyed and the North lost to Parliament. A new hero arises here: Cromwell, a name synonymous with the English Civil War and the key player in the later two civil wars.<br/><br/>Second Newbury, 27 October 1644<br/>    The disaster that precipitated the forming of the New Model Army. Three Parliamentary armies come together and catch the King by surprise just north of Newbury. The most unconventional of all the battles; the superior Parliamentary force attacks from either end, but is short on time. Various options on gaining more time by shortening the flank march give this action high replay value.<br/><br/>Naseby, 14 June 1645<br/>    The debut of the New Model Army and the battle that broke the back of the King's army. The New Model Army was created by combining the elements of the major armies in the field. While this worked well for the cavalry, there were serious problems in the infantry ranks. The King's army was outnumbered, but it retained its corps of veteran infantry. The final result was a decisive defeat for the King and the end of his military fortunes. Though fighting would last another year, the King would never field a potent army again.<br/><br/>COUNTERS: 635 full-color die-cut counters.<br/><br/>MAP: Two 22&quot;x34&quot; full-color back-printed mapsheets<br/><br/>OTHER: <br/><br/>    One 10-sided dice<br/>    16-page Rulebook<br/>    24-page Playbook<br/>    2 11x17 Player Aid cards<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>DESIGNER: Ben Hull<br/>DEVELOPER: Marty Arsndorf<br/>ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

Rooted soundly in Mark Herman's award-winning We The People system, The Napoleonic Wars provides refinements that allow two-to-five players to play an exciting game requiring two to ten hours. The majority of your games will easily end in a single evening, thanks to sudden death victory conditions providing variable game lengths that eliminate the &quot;end of the world&quot; phenomenon that plague many games. Often, you'll set 'em up and knock 'em down twice a night, and once in a great while your Campaign game will require two nights of play for the terrific panoramic history to unfold before your eyes.<br/><br/>Like similar card-driven games, The Napoleonic Wars provides strategy cards that are played as events or to activate leaders, armies or fleets (by play of command points) to move on the map. Players must constantly weight the value of an event or reaction card against the need for its command points. Command points themselves can be played for a wide variety of activities, making play unpredictable and fresh with each sitting.

The French believing that an attack would always win and that elan would carry the day, prepared to assault the lightly held German lines in Alsalce-Lorraine.<br/><br/>Both plans failed.<br/><br/>Drive on Paris allows both sides to execute the historical campaigns or variations on them and are rated for victory on how well their operation succeeds. Players can rearrange their Mobilization Points to change the change the force allocations from the historical ones to reinforce their effort or to better counter the enemy's.<br/><br/>Both side must rapidly attack and defend at the same time...and you'll never have enough troops and power to do both perfectly, so your allocation of scarce resources will be the key to your success.<br/><br/>This system uses a two-tracked method of determining victory. It isn't the usual &quot;one side tries something, while the other tries to stop it&quot;. Rather, both sides must strive toward their own goals while putting forth enough effort to stall the enemy. It is possible for both sides to &quot;win&quot; ending the game in a net draw (which is why you'll need to dedicate some effort to stopping the enemy support).<br/><br/>Drive on Paris is the seventh game in the popular, easy-to-play Standard Combat Series. These games are designed to be easy enough for novice players, yet meaty enough to retain the interest of veterans. It violates two principals of game design at the same time: Easy games are dumb, and the converse that interesting games are hard.

This was His Majesty's Royal Army, commanded by General Sir William Howe. They were marching through the extreme southeastern corner of Pennsylvania and heading toward fledgling America's capital at Philadelphia. Only short weeks earlier this army had disembarked at Head of Elk, Maryland, after a 32-day voyage from New York City aboard the largest armada North America has ever seen. With some 14,000 troops, including crack German mercenaries and elite American Loyalist units, Howe's army was about to execute a flanking maneuver of &quot;Jacksonian&quot; proportions.<br/><br/>General George Washington, holding interior lines at Morristown, New Jersey, was unsure whether Howe would move north in support of the British invasion from Canada (see Saratoga, 1777), or whether he would move south against the Capital. Once the armada set sail, however, Washington shifted southwest and took up a naturally strong defensive position, on high ground behind Brandywine Creek, astride the main road to Philadelphia. Washington posted his troops advantageously and in depth. Control of the fords of the Brandywine would be the key to his position and although a possible flank attack was discussed, it's likelihood was discounted on the strength of local information.<br/><br/>Thus the stage was set. Howe, pursuing a strategy of posts, sought European style victory in a sudden taking of the enemy capital. Washington wrote, &quot;Should they push their designs against Philadelphia...they will put the contest on the event of a single battle. If they are overthrown...the war is at an end.

The float and march south from Canada had almost a surreal quality juxtaposed against the Adirondack wilderness. Hundreds of vessels making up an immense inland navy on Lake Champlain transported nearly 9,000 combatants together with 138 cannon. Burgoyne's objective was Fort Ticonderoga and from there, Albany, and a rendezvous with British forces coming from New York City. The strategic purpose of the campaign was nothing short of an end to the American Rebellion.<br/><br/>The intrigue on the American side lay in the cult of personality. Saratoga was to be Benedict Arnold's greatest victory in a string of successes which rank him among the finest field commanders of the era. Known to all Americans as the great traitor, it is ironic to discover that twice he salvaged the Revolution from certain collapse. It was Arnold's conspicuous gallantry and bold leadership which assured America victory at Saratoga and, by extension, its independence.<br/><br/>The fighting at Freeman's Farm would be savage. Here no farmer's militia, but rather Continental Regulars (anxious to redeem a recent reputation for retreat), stood toe to toe with Europe's finest. The sanguinary nature of the fighting was summed up best by American Brigadier General John Glover who said, &quot;Both sides seemed determined to conquer or die.&quot;<br/><br/>It's the 19th of September, 1777. Do you, as the British, attempt to storm the prepared American positions on the high ground at Bemis Heights in order to open up the River Road and the most direct route to Albany? Or do you attempt to turn the American left where intelligence reports the American defenses are incomplete and the ground favors your approach? How will you employ the large number of Hessian mercenaries in your army? Will their performance match their reputation?<br/><br/>As the Americans do you wait on Bemis Heights for the approach of the enemy as General Gates preferred, or do you sortie and meet the approach of the British in the forests where their artillery will be of little value? Will Generals Gates and Arnold cooperate, or will their feud spell disaster for the American cause? And what of the fog on this chilly Autumn morning? Will it be an ally to the Americans by impeding the progress of the enemy?<br/><br/>These are only a few of the challenges facing you as you relive one of history's most decisive battles and the turning point of the American Revolution.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"32231": "First Edition"}, "average": "7.11692", "name": "Saratoga", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "333", "boardgameaccessory": {"170214": "Saratoga: Mounted Mapboard"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"54": "Battles of the American Revolution"}}, "3414": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic361595.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"406": {"name": "Dean Essig"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1995", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"406": "Dean Essig"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"219": {"name": "The Gamers"}}, "maxplaytime": "240", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic361595_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": {"1069": {"name": "Modern Warfare"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"22217": "1995 Charles S.

Fresh from his victory in Poland, Hitler planned a blow that would knock France out of the war. key to this plan was knife-like attack through the Ardennes to the English Channel which would split the Allied forces moving north to block the expected replay of 1914 and the Maginot Line forces immobile in the south. To add to the trap, the Germans planned the first massive airborne operation of the war. This attack would capture the hinterland of Holland, pave the way for subordinate German Armored thrusts crossing the Maas, and to continue the lure the Allies northward.<br/><br/>Fallschirmjaeger covers this bait. The German player plops down an airborne invasion force with the goal of fighting off all-comers until relieved by advancing ground forces. The Dutch, all but abandoned by their French and British Allies, put up a fight for the record books. The German air bridge held on by its fingernail. While the main German drive was never in doubt, these scattered paratroopers had the fight of their lives against a small nation unwilling to succumb without giving the fight everything.<br/><br/>In the end, the Dutch government had to be evacuated along with the Dutch Gold Reserve, to form a government in exile. They would return after liberation.<br/><br/>The player must do all these things, or smash the German paratroopers before they are rescued by the Panzers, to win.

Also, the different car types have different braking characteristics.<br/><br/>The game includes two tracks printed on the same board, Monte Carlo and Le Mans.  Each track is only two lanes wide, and the spaces on the track are only a half-car-length, so a car takes up two spaces at once.<br/><br/>The cars move in order of track position.

If a car spins out, a &quot;wet track&quot; marker is placed on the corner, subsequently requiring all cars to roll for a chance when going through it.<br/><br/>If a car is blocked and cannot move the entire number of spaces required (and the car has no more hard braking left and cannot down shift enough), the cars collide.

However, in Risikard, battles are resolved by use of cards, instead of dice, and the board serves more as a visual indicator than a gaming area.<br/><br/>The game consists of 1 small map board, 2 tank pieces, a rule book and 110 cards.<br/><br/>There are 42 Territory Cards, each representing one of the areas on the map. Of the information on these cards, the most important are the number 'Value', of which a certain amount are needed to win the game, and the 'Winning Symbol' (explained below). There are 54 Army Cards and one Wild Card. All army cards have symbols representing either infantry, cavalry or artillery and a value from 1-6. There are also 13 Mission Cards, which remain hidden to others throughout the game, and state the formula one must obtain to win.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, territories are selected one at a time and starting army hands and a mission card are drawn.<br/><br/>Each turn then commences with an attack by declaring war on an adjacent territory. Cards are revealed from the attacker and defenders hand and whoever has the higher number wins, the wild card trumping any other value. When one player wins two battles, that person gains the other's territory card.<br/><br/>The second stage of the turn is the protection of territories. In this turn you may choose to defend territories by presenting three Territory Cards with different 'Winning Symbols' from the same continent (also known as a &quot;set&quot;). Protected territories may not be attacked but also can't aid to increase your number of army cards. Army cards in hand are then discarded and the same number of cards are drawn at which point the player may attack again.<br/><br/>In the final stage of a turn, the player adjusts his/her hand based on the number of sets that aren't part of protected territories that they control.<br/><br/>The game is won when a player fulfills the requirements of the 'victory formula' stated on his/her Mission Card. An example of this formula is you must control all of Africa, Oceania and you must have additional territories totalling a value of 12 or more.

Components: 300 plastic markers, 150 tokens, 8 ships made of metal with 2 masts, 55 cards (3rd edition only), 3 six-sided special dice, 1 rules booklet.<br/><br/>Between the second and third edition, the theme of the game changed. The first and second have a theme of four nations exploring and colonizing new land, while the third edition has a pirate theme. The third edition also adds 55 action cards, resulting in more chaos and - possibly - less strategy (at least that's what is suggested in the rules).<br/><br/>The board shows an island group composed of five smaller island groups separated by ocean. There is a large island group in the middle and four smaller ones in the corners. The four smaller island groups are the homelands of the four nations in editions 1 and 2 and the pirate bases in edition 3. Nations / pirates set out to explore and conquer the big island group in the middle (or each others' homelands).<br/><br/>Every round, each nation / pirate group has 10 action points. With these you can accomplish various actions: move, load ships, explore unknown areas, attack your opponents, etc. Most important action is probably exploration, in which you roll two special dice which determine how many natives and how much gold there is in a neighboring, unexplored land.

These are claimed by placing a castle and cathedral on the specified area of the map board.<br/><br/>Play commences with the Administrative Phase where players collect taxes based on the number of territories and cathedrals they control. Following is the Military phase that is divided into three optional steps. The first is to roll 2d6 for a random event that will cause the player to either gain or lose money, lose cards, lose castles or become the pope. The second option is to build new castles on your territories. The final is an attack on another person's territory.<br/><br/>Territories can attack adjacent territories or those on the same body of water. The attacking and defensive force are determined by the number of castles on each territory. For each castle on his/her territory, the attacker and defenders each roll a die and apply any modifiers obtained by cathedrals or cards in his/her possession. Results of 6 or over destroy a castle of the opposing side. If all of the defenders castles are lost, the attacker wins the territory, places a castle to claim it and may draw a card at the end of the phase.

Four 2x2 movable attack boards attach to the corners of the fixed boards, above or under, so that the game actually has a total of seven planes (but only 16 of the 96 extra squares are &quot;in existence&quot; at any one time). The attack boards are also necessary as bridges between the fixed boards. Notation of positions and moves (since now there are sometimes several possible paths between any two starting and ending squares) is initially problematic, but well addressed by Mr. Bartmess.<br/><br/>The standard set up is uneven, with the lower (white) board's attack boards starting above instead of under as called for by symmetry.

Each picture has a matching tile, which is placed face down over it. Players each receive a number of chips and then take two or three (depending on the number of players), of the tiles for themselves, announcing which they have taken and then laying them face down in front of them. Now play begins.<br/><br/>The players take turns to roll the die and then move around the board. At first they generally land on a space where the picture is covered by a tile. They take this tile for themselves, and lay it face down in front of them announcing as they do so which it was. As the tiles start to disappear though, players land on spaces where the tile is already missing. They then have to say who they think has that tile. If correct, they receive the tile. If the named player however thinks that he hasn't got the tile, then he may in turn name another player, and so on until either a named player accepts that he has the tile, or a player who has already been named is named again. Then it is sorted out who really did have the tile, working backwards through the chain of accusations until it is found. The owner, when unmasked, passes it to the first player correctly to have named him, and all players who have falsely accused someone must pay chips into the Bank, one chip for each false accusation made in that turn.<br/><br/>Obviously, the passing on of tiles complicates matters terribly. It is simple enough to remember who took the tile in the first place, but by the time you have unraveled a chain of four or five false accusations, trying to remember who now has the tile is not so simple. The game goes on until either someone has collected a specified number of tiles, dependent on the number of players, or someone has no chips left. A player's tiles count two points each and every remaining chip one point, so it is quite possible to win without collecting many tiles, you merely have to avoid guessing falsely.<br/>(Jon Webley from GameCabinet)<br/><br/>"}, "3501": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Fantasy", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2007": "Pick-up and Deliver"}, "yearpublished": "1990", "usersrated": "22", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic292008_t.jpg", "average": "4.81818", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"253": {"name": "Editrice Giochi"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic292008.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"195677": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1020": {"name": "Exploration"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "The players represent wizards and visit the many cities of the board delivering messages.

The first player to collect all of the tail feathers wins.<br/><br/>Setup: There are two sets of large, thick cardboard tiles.  One set of 12 are shaped as octagons, and the other set of 24 are shaped as eggs. Each octagon shows a different chicken-related image, and the same image appears on two of the eggs. The octagons are spread out randomly on the table, face down. The eggs are then arranged randomly, but face up, in a large circle around the octagons, creating a kind of &quot;pathway&quot; of egg tiles that is encircling the &quot;yard&quot; (of octagons). Each player has a single large wooden chicken in their color, and each chicken has slots on its backside into which wooden &quot;tail feathers&quot; may be stuck. Each chicken begins with only one tail feather, in its color. The chickens are then placed randomly on the egg tiles, with an equal number of unoccupied tiles separating each chicken from the next chicken &quot;ahead&quot; of it on the pathway as separate it from the next chicken &quot;behind&quot; it, with the goal that they be well spread out on the pathway.<br/><br/>Gameplay: The game is then played in turns, with players attempting to move their chickens clockwise around the pathway. On a player's turn, she looks at the image on the next egg tile in front of her chicken. The player then turns over one of the 12 face down octagon yard tiles. If the tile turned over shows the same image as the egg tile, the player moves forward one space on to that egg tile, turns the octagon back face down, and then repeats the process with the next egg tile. When the player turns over an octagon with an image that does not match the next egg tile in front of her, her turn ends and her chicken goes no farther. If the next tile in front of a player is occupied by someone else's chicken, then the player looks at the image that is on the egg tile in front of the other chicken, and then attempts to turn over the octagon showing *that* image. If the player succeeds, her chicken &quot;leapfrogs&quot; over the chicken in front of her to land on that egg tile, and in the process steals all tail feathers that the other chicken had - including those it stole from other players in the same manner. When one player has all of the tail feathers, that player wins the game.<br/><br/>In Sum: A creative memory game that ties memory to pawn movement.  The first player to successfully memorize the images on each of the 12 octagon tiles, both from their own turns and from watching other players flip the octagons on their turns, will be able to move their chicken around the yard without stopping, and in doing so will win the game.

It depicted a hypothetical corps-level invasion of North America by a coalition of three invaders: The European Socialist coalition, the South American Union, and the Pan Asiatic League. The game is played on a 35 inch by 42 inch map, with 400 cardboard pieces representing the armed forces in the war. As was typical of wargames of this genre, each piece had numerical combat and movement ratings printed on it. The board is divided up into small hexagons (each of which represented approximately 50,000 square kilometers). On each turn a player can move all of his pieces through a number of hexagon spaces equal to its movement rating. Then pieces in adjacent spaces engage in combat by comparing their combat ratings and rolling dice. The combat ratings and the dice roll are cross-referenced to determine the outcome of the combat. Many spaces on the map also have distinctive terrain features like forests or mountains which affect the ratings of units in those spaces.<br/><br/>Invasion: America is intended as a four player game; one player is the defender and controlls the forces of the United States and Canada (Mexico and Central America were American-occupied territory). The other three players are the three invaders of the coalition. Each turn of the game represents one month and the game lasts for 60 turns. The North American player wins if he still controls a portion of the continent by the game's end. If the North American player loses, whichever of the invading players holds the most territory is the winner. The result is that the invaders cooperated to an extent in attacking the North American player but ultimately were competing against each other.

Bets are placed on horses based on their form, starting position and taking into account any cards a player has to influence the race. During the race, players roll a die and compare the result to the horse's form to determine the movement value. Horses can move in and out of lanes based on the positions of other horses and any special cards that are used.<br/><br/>At the end of the race, bets are resolved and a predetermined purse is paid to the top 3 horses.
