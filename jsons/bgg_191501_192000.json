It can be played separately, or together with Soldier Emperor; our Dreams of Empire book includes a linking map and the rules and pieces for its use.<br/><br/>Indian Empires is a new edition of our long out-of print Soldier Raj. It includes over a dozen scenarios from Hyder Ali's defeat of the British in the First Mysore War in 1767 to Britain's final conquest of the Sikhs in 1846. Colorful leaders of the time are all present: Hyder Ali and Tippoo of Mysore. Sir Arthur Wellesley, the &quot;sepoy general&quot; who would become Duke of Wellington. The brilliant Madhav Rao of the Marathas. France's Admiral Suffren. Zaman Shah of Afghanistan, and the Sikh ruler Ranjit Singh. These and more lead your armies.<br/><br/>The playing pieces are decadently thick tiles; pieces like the Mysore Tiger Soldier or the Maratha War Elephant are original works of art by Terry Moore Strickland. As in Soldier Emperor, successful card play is a key to victory.<br/><br/>As in Soldier Emperor, players command their nation's military, political and economic destiny. The map is a painting of South Asia, with a network of areas and routes between them laid over it. Generals move their armies along these routes, attempting to conquer territory for their nation. Fleets control the seas around India; the locals have very little seapower, and Britain outnumbers France on the seas.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved by dice rolls, with larger armies casting more dice. Good generalship is even more crucial in India than in Europe.

Each game board shows nine dice, and once arranged the completed grid shows 36 dice, with the dice being numbered 1-6 and showing six colors, with each combination of number and color appearing exactly once. Roll the color die and number die to determine the starting location for the transparent robot, then mark this space with the transparent starting token.<br/><br/>In a round, roll the two dice to determine the target space; you can mark this space with a transparent victory token or simply have everyone remember which space they're trying to reach. Everyone simultaneously tries to figure out how to move the robot to the target space, and to move the robot, it must move orthogonally to a space that shares either the color or number of its current location. If the robot starts on &quot;3-green&quot;, for example, it can move orthogonally to any space that shows either a 3 or is green; if you'd move it to &quot;5-green&quot;, it can now once again move orthogonally to any space that shows either a 5 or is green; and so on.<br/><br/>As soon as a player has a solution, they yell out the number of moves, then take the robot and demonstrate the solution. If the solution takes exactly the number of moves claimed, the player earns a victory token; if not, the player gives one of their victory tokens (if they have any) to the player with the fewest tokens. In either case, the former target space becomes the new starting space for the next round.<br/><br/>If any player possesses five victory tokens, they win! If the 25 victory tokens are distributed before someone collects five, then whoever holds the most tokens wins, with ties being possible.<br/><br/>Expert Micro Robots players can increase the challenge of the game by placing the target victory token on the board, then rolling the two dice once again.

Now all you need to do is finish your plans and set them free before these Investigators find you!<br/><br/>Rise of Cthulhu: Dark Secrets is the first expansion to last year&rsquo;s successful Rise of Cthulhu card game. ROC: DS adds all new Monsters, Artifacts, and Old Ones for players to use in their shadowy path to victory. In addition, the expansion introduces a brand new mechanic: the Investigator. These &ldquo;would-be heroes&rdquo; set out to hunt down rumors of your corrupting influence and seek to stop you from awakening the Old Ones. When they appear, they force both you and your opponent to deal with the threat they bring, lest they halt the coming of the age of madness you seek to unleash.<br/><br/>When an Investigator card is drawn, it is placed on the corresponding Location printed in the upper right hand corner of the card. When an Investigator lands on a Location without an Old One, it banishes all the Cultists assembled there, effectively returning all Cultist cards in play to their owner&rsquo;s hands. Any Monsters or Artifacts that are in play on that Location are removed from the game. The Location then resets to neutral (turns sideways so that it&rsquo;s not facing either player).<br/><br/>Each Investigator has a number in a red circle in the upper left hand corner of their frame. This represents their resources they bring to bear against both cultist players. Players must play Cultist cards to equal or exceed the resource value listed to remove the Investigator from the Location. Until the Investigator is removed from the Location, players may not play any Cultist cards on any other Location except that one; furthermore, cards played on a Location with an Investigator present on it do not cause the Location to shift to face the player with the highest total value of cards. Once the resource rating is met or exceeded, the Investigator is defeated and removed, at which time the Location would face the player with the highest total Cultists in play there.<br/><br/>Lastly, this expansion adds a new player aide to the card, something the community asked for following the release of the core game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"297198": "English first edition"}, "average": "6.8", "name": "Rise of Cthulhu: Dark Secrets", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "15", "expands": {"161719": {"name": "Rise of Cthulhu"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "191615": {"boardgamedesigner": {"88344": {"name": "Steve Langan"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Setting The East Ablaze!", "playingtime": "240", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2839845_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2663": {"name": "Partizan Press"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2839845.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"297216": "English first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": {"1047": {"name": "Miniatures"}}, "age": "11", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Setting The East Ablaze! contains miniature wargame rules for warfare in Central Europe, Russia, Central Asia, China and elsewhere from the years 1917-1926.<br/><br/>These rules are designed for medium-sized games (c. 60-70 figures per side), but they do work just as well for smaller skirmish-level games, and for larger games of up to 500 figures per side.<br/><br/>Rules use standard six-sided dice.

Here, priests of old sacrificed over the tomb of long dead Kha M Thir, honoring him for his long service to the Red God.<br/><br/>They added bastions to the keep, walls, temple and barracks. From there they terrorized the surrounding country, raiding the villages of Alice, Greenbriar and Ends Meet until at last the rangers gathered against the Cult and overthrew it. They drove them from their walls and those they did not slay, fled into the Darkenfold to the south.<br/><br/>The castle has sat thus ever since, a grim testament to the gods of the old world. The forest has consumed it and only the memories of men keep it alive. But beyond its abandoned walls lie the shadows of yesteryear.

A select band of bards have traveled the earth acquiring the legends of the most unbelievable legends of Goblins past. The stories of their conquests are unlike traditional legends, crafted from improbable accomplishments, incalculable risk, and a nearly absurd amount of luck. The epic tales of these forgotten heroes belie their diminutive stature.

Creatures of darkest myth, artifacts of untold power, diabolical traps, and recovery from catastrophic misfortune fill your mind and flow from your tongue as you compete for the attention of the audience.

Each season, as their young men and women approach adulthood, they prepare for the ceremony of St&aacute;la, in which the youths demonstrate both their worthiness as defenders and providers for the tribe, and their attractiveness to prospective mates. The Azon&eacute; value equally skill in deadly combat, and the ability to construct and wear battle garb of exquisite beauty. It is the balance of these two traits that make the Azon&eacute; &quot;butterfly warriors&quot; (or &quot;Tyri&aacute;&quot;) truly great.<br/><br/>User Summary:<br/>At the start of the game, each player creates three beasts, each with a rating from 1 to 9, for a total of 13 points distributed between them. Then each round, for three rounds, the players choose to split 10 points between the beauty of their battle gear and its effectiveness.<br/>If the effectiveness is not high enough, then the beast could wound the character (with a second wound killing them). But after facing three attacks, it is the surviving player with the highest beauty that wins. However if the total combat effectiveness is too low, then the village will be overrun by beasts in the end.<br/><br/>"}, "191692": {"rpgitemversion": {"297346": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "The Volume of Secrets", "rpgproducer": {"40477": "James P.

High-ranking personalities prevent the members of the opposing family from using their subjects for their own purposes and from erecting valuable buildings &mdash; but everything comes at a price. Who will lead his family to fame and honor?<br/><br/>Text from publisher:<br/><br/>The position of the leader of the empire is vacant. But who has what it takes to become the new king? In order to increase their power, the contenders for the throne rally the country and its people around themselves.<br/><br/>Who will make the best use of the influence of important personalities and engage his competitors in conflicts without suffering damage himself? Rival Kings is a stalwart card game from HUCH! &amp; friends.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each cycle, each player chooses one Character card and places it face down in front of him. Once all players have done so, they turn them over simultaneously. The Character cards determine the order of play, the number of possible actions, and potential conflicts. Low-ranking characters have more actions at their disposal, but they may act only after the higher-ranking characters. In addition, each character may come into conflict with certain other characters. When this happens, the higher-ranking character may take one action from the inferior character and carry it out immediately; this action is then no longer available to the lower ranked during his turn.<br/><br/>After the Character cards have been played and potential conflicts have been resolved, the action phase begins. Now, depending on the action, a player can take money, get rid of Conflict markers, recruit subjects, or buy a building. Players try to secure good combinations of buildings and subjects for themselves in order to get a high score in the end. Besides this, the subjects recruited during the game provide different advantages that can have a crucial impact on the course of the game. However, only one subject is active per player &ndash; if a new Subject card is added, it covers the player's previously laid-out bonus.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as one of the card piles has been depleted. The player who has collected the best combinations and has as few Conflict markers as possible lying in front of him has the best chance of assuming the throne.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"297657": "Multilingual first edition"}, "age": "8", "name": "Rival Kings", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2004": "Set Collection"}, "average": "6.18", "usersrated": "25", "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}}, "191880": {"boardgamedesigner": {"72900": {"name": "Arve D.

If a player loses a card in a row, then any cards in the same column behind this card slide forward to fill the empty slot. On a turn, a player has as many action points as the number of columns they have in the playing area. They can use these action points to draw cards, play cards to the battlefield, play a mythological card for its power, or challenge an opponent's card.<br/><br/>To challenge, the player chooses a card in their first row that abuts an opponent's card, then reveals both of them. Most cards have a strength value (0-7), and the card with the lower strength value is discarded, with the opponent's other cards in the same column then sliding forward.<br/><br/>If a player cannot use all of their actions or has no actions (due to having no cards on the battlefield) or loses control of Odin's Crown/Ring, then they lose the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"297803": "English first edition"}, "name": "Thunder & Lightning", "playingtime": "40", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "age": "13", "usersrated": "459", "average": "7.36414"}, "191965": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Will Fight for Food", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"297805": "Windows/Mac/Linux Downloadable edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2848333.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2319": "Cartoon"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "5", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"5248": "Linux"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2848333_t.jpg", "description": "Jared Casey Dent was a wrestler in a down-and-out bloodstained middle American town.<br/><br/>He lost his own tournament in disgrace and vanished into the night.<br/><br/>Now he&rsquo;s back, and he&rsquo;s going to set his life straight using one of these time tested techniques:<br/><br/>Brutal violence / His wavering, hamfisted brand of subtle persuasion / Side questing for loose change / All of the options<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "191966": {"boardgamedesigner": {"88399": {"name": "Eddy Sterckx"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Waterloo Squares", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2846096_t.jpg", "average": "8", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2846096.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"297807": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1051": {"name": "Napoleonic"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "Waterloo Squares is 2-player entry-level wargame of the battle of Waterloo 1815 played on a map which represents the historical battlefield.<br/><br/>One player assumes the role of Napoleon and takes command of the French, the other player represents the Wellington/Bl&uuml;cher combination and will command the Allies (British, Dutch/Belgian, minor German states and Prussian)<br/><br/>The Light Blue and Dark Blue counters represent the French forces, the Grey counters the Prussians and the Red counters all the other Allied forces.

In der kleinen Stadt Elorica an der K&uuml;ste der Kristallsee k&ouml;nnen die Abenteurer erfahren, was die Motive der Korsaren sind, und auf ungew&ouml;hnliche Methoden zur&uuml;ckgreifen, wenn es darum geht, ihnen unrechtm&auml;&szlig;ig erworbenes Eigentum wieder abzunehmen.<br/><br/>Wenn man in der Eint&ouml;nigkeit hoher See auf ein Bootsdorf fahrender Schausteller trifft, verspricht das Abwechslung, Spannung und Spektakel. All das erwartet auch die Abenteurer, wenn auch anders, als sie oder die Gaukler sich das gedacht h&auml;tten. Denn ein Mord im Schwimmenden Zirkus bringt die Vorstellung geh&ouml;rig durcheinander, und es bleibt an den Abenteurern, unter G&auml;sten, Matrosen und Schaustellern den Schuldigen zu finden.<br/><br/>S&auml;mtliche Abenteuer sind voneinander losgel&ouml;st spielbar und so konzipiert, dass ihr Startpunkt an unterschiedliche Orte gelegt werden und so an die Bed&uuml;rfnisse Ihrer Gruppe angepasst werden kann.

Players compete with each other to see who can amass the greatest horde of gold. As they gain experience and grow into larger and more capable dragons they will also face the challenge of slayers. With only 9 rounds to play it will be a tight race to see who can be most infamous Wyrm!<br/><br/>On your turn you will take actions that include search, eat, move, explore, raze, and fight. The explore action will allow you to draw new tiles to expand the play area. The search action will let you draw an event for a specific tile, which may be a fort, ruins, or a farm. These farms and forts may be razed for gold, or you can eat the livestock they produce to grow and gain experience.<br/><br/>Experience can be used to grow your dragon, from whelp to drake, and then to a mighty wyrm! You will also use experience to unlock and upgrade skills for your dragon. Each dragon has several unique skills that only they can use, no two dragons are exactly the same.<br/><br/>Each new round will start by introducing a new slayer to the board. The player who's turn it is to go first will control this slayer for the rest of the time it remains on the board. These slayers come in a variety of forms, from the simple bandit chieftain, to the mighty heroes of legend. Defeat these slayers and you will earn gold and experience, fail and you will have some of your actions crippled for a time.<br/><br/>Throughout the 9 rounds there will be new objectives introduced that will give players chances to earn more gold as they complete them.

A number of bonus buttons, which have 1-4 holes, are stacked on the table, again based on the number of players. Going clockwise around the table, each player (after the first) places one loop on the table so that it surrounds exactly one spool, then draws a word tag from the box and attaches it to this loop, then places one spool in one section of loop(s) that has no spool in it. (Think of a Venn diagram; two overlapping circles form three sections, with one section having both circles in common and two sections being part of only one circle.)<br/><br/>Once all of the spools have been placed, everyone races to think of words, names, or phrases for each spool based on the word tags associated with that spool. If a spool has three loops around it, for example, it has three words associated with it, and your answer must relate to those words in some manner.<br/><br/>As soon as someone has finished or can't think of more answers, they grab the topmost button on the stack (the one with the most holes). Once the final button is grabbed, players can't write more answers. Players then compare answers, crossing out those they have in common with someone else, then scoring points for the remaining answers; each answer is worth as many points as the number of loops around the spool with the same number. Buttons are worth as many points as the number of holes they have, and whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>"}, "191983": {"boardgamedesigner": {"88404": {"name": "Ron Niabati"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Global Collapse", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2857712_t.jpg", "average": "4.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2857712.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"297830": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "THEME<br/>YEAR = 2025<br/>WORLD POPULATION = 8 Billion<br/>GLOBAL TEMPERATURE RISE = 1 degree C<br/>As the first quarter of the century comes to an end, world leaders have yet to achieve any meaningful reduction in global carbon emissions. Food production is being disrupted around the world, and demand is surging for dwindling resources. In the decades to come there will be countless crises, like economic collapse, political revolutions, disastrous weather, failed states, disruptive technologies with unknown consequences, and much more. The only certainty is that when people are faced with famine, they will always migrate and raid their neighbors before starving.<br/><br/>Set in the near future, the players take on the roles of the USA, Western Europe, Russia, China, and India. Collectively, these five major global powers dominate the world&rsquo;s economic, military, political, social, and technological powers. By cooperating and strategizing, the players must put their collective powers into actions to lower carbon emissions while resolving the many crises around the world.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/>The world is divided into 15 regions, each with its own population, food capacity, carbon emissions, sociopolitical stability, and likely number of people that would suffer when hit by famine. At the start of each turn a number of crises are revealed to all the players. Each crisis is associated with one of the 15 regions. The players must then decide what actions they will take, unilaterally or jointly, to resolve which crises by implementing their economic, military, political, social, technological powers. Alongside dealing with crises around the world, the players must quickly reduce global carbon emissions and prevent their own regions from becoming a failed state. This can be done by implementing green energies and developing advanced technologies. At the end of each turn the global temperature rises, and if it exceeds a new threshold then food capacity is reduced in every region worldwide. If any region loses its ability to feed its population then famine strikes, starting a chain reaction of refugees, conflicts, failed states, and megadeath! Players must devise innovative solutions to tackle Earth&rsquo;s most urgent problems. Act too selfishly, and you accelerate humanity&rsquo;s demise. Act too altruistically, and you could be overrun by climate refugees and chaos.<br/><br/>EVERYONE LOSES WHEN&hellip;<br/>If the global temperature rises by six degrees Celsius, there won&rsquo;t be any way to stop the runaway greenhouse. It will result in Earth&rsquo;s sixth mass extinction, possibly the greatest one in geologic time! Still, a rising global temperature alone is not the only thing that can bring the end of human civilization. Some regions of the world and its people may be forsaken, mired in conflicts, epidemics, and anarchy. If the chaos consumes most of the world then there will be no safe-haven left for anyone, and all nations will inevitable become failed states. If either condition is met before the end of this century then it is a Global Collapse . . . the beginning of the end of all human civilization!<br/><br/>YOU WIN WHEN&hellip;<br/>If the two conditions for losing are not met by the end of this century, and your region is not a failed state, then humanity is saved and your civilization leads the world into the next century.<br/><br/>"}, "191985": {"boardgamedesigner": {"73114": {"name": "Dan Letzring"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Ph.

Clandestine support from both Russia and the West fuels the war and keeps any hope of peace at bay. In the meantime, the civil war in Syria and the fight against Islamic extremism gathers steam. NATO and Russia stare each other down in a &quot;coopetittion&quot; in the region, and tensions rise meteorically as not so &quot;friendly&quot; fire incidents occur. The West tightens sanctions against Russia and ratchets up its rhetoric; Russia, meanwhile, attempting to regain a place in global power politics, responds with sanctions of its own against Turkey and starts low-level cyber warfare and &quot;little green men&quot; incidents in the Baltics. Tempers flare across the world, Turkey shoots down another Russian plane while Russian SAM batteries shoot down a Turkish F-16 in retaliation. Russia declares enough is enough, decides on war with NATO, and invades the Baltics and Poland. Belorussia, knowing where it's bread is buttered, joins in.  Some NATO nations rush to the rescue while others debate the issue. Once again, Europe trembles to the rumble of tank treads and marching boots&hellip;<br/><br/>Next War: Poland, the fourth volume in GMT's Next War Series. This game moves the action from Asia to Europe and allows players to fight a near future war in Poland as the Russians and their allies invade and NATO responds.<br/><br/>Only a portion of Poland is shown as Ukraine is assumed to be in the midst of a grinding civil war. The Russians are not the behemoth of the Cold War, but they possess good material and a much better trained army. The Baltics may fall quickly, although their forces may put up some resistance and make an appearance as reinforcements, and the front quickly establishes itself in eastern Poland as the Russian 6th and 20th Armies push forward while NATO rushes forces into the area spearheaded by the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps and followed up by whatever nation's troops respond to the Article 5 declaration. The question is, can NATO stop the Russians or will Poland be overrun?<br/><br/>Note: the Next War series is not an Introductory wargame. Rather, we have intended herein to create a system (and a series) that will allow detailed study of modern warfare in various venues as well as engaging gameplay. That said, the Standard Game rules encompass a fairly straightforward ruleset that will, we think, be considered pretty &quot;easy to learn&quot; by experienced wargamers. So players who choose to play Standard Game scenarios can have a relatively quick game when that's what suits them. The real flavor of a war in the theatre, though, comes through in the Advanced Game, where you get much more control over airpower and can more clearly see each side's strengths and weaknesses. For players who want a &quot;mini-monster game&quot; experience, playing the Advanced Game Campaign Scenarios with some or all of the optional rules will definitely &quot;deliver.&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"297840": "First edition"}, "average": "8.5", "name": "Next War: Poland", "playingtime": "1200", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"23935": "GMT Next War Series"}}, "191990": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2853079.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"10426": {"name": "Yann and Clem"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"69731": "Alexandre Bonvalot"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"15984": {"name": "Devil Pig Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2853079_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "Keep your Heroes of Normandie games fresh and interesting with regular new content!

When someone discovers the Lost Legacy, the game ends, everyone tallies the value of the cards they've played and the card left in hand, and whoever has the highest total wins.<br/><br/><br/>By combining different Lost Legacy sets (while keeping only a single Lost Legacy card in play), up to six players can compete at the same time.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"297854": "English first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "average": "7.28327", "name": "Lost Legacy: Fourth Chronicle \u2013 The Werewolf & Undying Heart", "playingtime": "10", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "age": "14", "usersrated": "104", "boardgamefamily": {"25604": "Lost Legacy"}}, "191999": {"boardgamedesigner": {"122": {"name": "Andrew Looney"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Uglydoll Loonacy", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "2016", "boardgameimplementation": {"212759": "Pyramid Arcade Loonacy"}, "usersrated": "18", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2845971_t.png", "average": "6.27778", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"76": {"name": "Looney Labs"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2845971.png", "boardgameversion": {"297855": "English first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "5", "description": "Uglydoll Loonacy is a rapid fire card game in which players race to be the first to empty their hand by matching one of two images on each card in their hand with the images on the open piles in front of them.
