The player must confront a boss at the end of certain stages, but instead of actually fighting the boss in battle, the player is challenged to a mini-game where they must score more points than their opponent. The graphics in this installment featured simple backgrounds with bright colors. The boss theme that was later used in Wagan Land 2 and Super Wagan Land was first used in this installment for the shiritori and concentration mini-games.<br/><br/>The Game Gear version of the Wagan Land is different from the Famicom version and the plot involves Wagan Land being attacked by Dr. Devil once again. In order to avoid the afterimage effect that was caused by playing action games on an LCD game at the time of the game's release, some of the stages were redesigned and others were replaced. New power-up items for the action scenes were also added that were previously introduced in Wagan Land 2 (which was released prior to the Game Gear version), as well as an hourglass that stops time during the mini-game segments.

Off the field, your team needs to show a profit, or the owner will become angry and threaten your job. You need to control salary and staff costs while balancing the need to spend money to build and upgrade your stadium against the risk of facing stagnant ticket revenue with an aging arena.<br/><br/>Roster Value. You need to negotiate contracts, sign free agents, make wise decisions in the amateur draft and outsmart opposing general managers in trade. Building a strong, capable roster means everything in Front Office Football.<br/><br/>Franchise Value. The bottom line is that a happy owner has a franchise that's the envy of professional football. Nothing means more to the owners than seeing their franchise on the top of the list of most valuable franchises. You help put your team on that list by excelling in the three other categories, but the best general managers look for opportunities to move the team in order to find a home town with a strong economy that will support your team like none other.<br/><br/>Each season, Herb the Referee evaluates your performance in these four categories, and presents your grades on his chalkboard.<br/><br/>"}, "101012": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Front Office Football: The College Years", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"103784": "Windows Version"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2365": "Sports - American Football"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2156": "Simulation"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "From the Publisher Website<br/><br/>The College Years is the college football counterpart to Solecismic Software's award-winning Front Office Football.<br/><br/>In The College Years, you assume the role of the head coach of a major college football team.

The battle ended with a French victory, but strategic defeat. Losses were terrible on both sides, but the Russians could replace theirs. One week after the battle Napoleon occupied an undefended Moscow, hoping to impose a peace, but after four weeks was forced to retreat home with calamitous results.<br/><br/>The historical battle involved wave after wave of frontal attacks by both sides, focusing on the Russian redoubts. However, the game will show all the options available to Napoleon and Kutuzov, including some not attempted historically. The French player has several possible lines of attack and the Russian player must try to anticipate and counter them all. The tactical interaction of Napoleonic infantry, cavalry and artillery is also emphasized, including cavalry charges and squares. This makes for exciting and tense gaming.<br/><br/>Movement and combat are resolved within areas. The game plays using the fast-paced Move-Move-Battle sequence seen in Hammer of the Scots and Shiloh. There are no cards involved; players activate leaders to command brigades of the same division of the same corps. Game time is 3-4 hours.&quot;<br/><br/>This game is scheduled to be released September 7, 2012.<br/><br/>Note:  This game should not be confused with Borodino 1812 or Borodino 1812 or any other similarly-named games.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"104097": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.12364", "name": "Borodino 1812", "playingtime": "210", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "age": "0", "usersrated": "55", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"6137": "Block wargames"}}, "101119": {"videogame": {"76524": "1942"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Capcom Classics Collection Volume 1", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"139089": "North American PlayStation 2 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1179001.jpg", "videogameseries": {"19594": "Capcom Classics Collection"}, "videogametheme": {"2508": "Military"}, "usersrated": "11", "average": "7.13636", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"76524": "1942"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1179001_t.jpg", "description": "Capcom Classics Collection is a compilation of arcade games released by Capcom for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox on September 27, 2005.

The first is I, Robot, a multi-directional shooter that has the player assume the role of &quot;Unhappy Interface Robot #1984&quot;, a servant bot that rebels against Big Brother.

The warps were activated by a Breakout clone at the bottom-right of the screen, where there would be two- or three-digit numbers. The player would have to move the joystick until the number matched the number required to warp. For example, the red warp required the number 23, so the player would move the joystick to the right or left until the first digit matched 2, then the player would click the fire button, the Breakout ball would start moving, so the player would have to play the breakout while moving the joystick to the 3 at the same time.

Roberts Best Board Game Graphics Nominee"}, "description": "During the night of 5-6 june 1944, the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions were to be parachuted behind Utah Beach in order to secure the approaches to the beach for the first wave of the landing forces. The sector had been flooded by the Germans, transofrmaing streams and lowlands into swamps and increasing the strategic value of the bridges and roads of the region. Of these, the two bridges located in the commune of Chef-du-Pont and the crossroads of Sainte-M&egrave;re-Eglise are of primary importance for the Allies. In fact, withouth capturing them, it would be impossible to advance quickly into the Cotentin Peninsula and enlarge the bridgehead.<br/><br/>The paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne need to be dropped onto three Drop Zones: The 505th PIR to the northwest of Sainte-M&egrave;re-Eglise, the 507th PIR to the north of Amfreville, and the 508th PIR to the south of Amfreville. The Americans did have some reservations about the chances of success of this airborne operation. The landing zones were surrounded by several swamps and the smallest error would lead to heavy losses. The most pessimistic predictions had the casualty rate at 80%.<br/><br/>While flying over the Cotentin, the troop transports were fired upon by German anti-aircraft defenses and thrown into disorder. Some pilots broke formation and gave the order to jump before the drop zones had been reached, leaving many parachutists dozens of kilometers away from their objectives. The less fortunate landed in the swampland and drowned in their heavy equipment. More than three-quarter of paratroopers did not land where they were supposed to, leading to the complete disorganization of the American troops dropped over France. This general state of disorder resulted in a series of clashes all over southeastern Cotentin. The Germans, themselves disorganized, limited their engagements against an enemy force whose objectives and strength remained unknown.<br/><br/>Despite an extremely high rate of losses (more than 50% during the night of 6 June 1944 alone), the American paratroopers of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions accomplished a great deal of their assigned missions. The Germans, disorganized by the chaos, were incapable of counter-attacking. The landing could begin.<br/><br/>Night Drop simulates the first hours of June 1944 and focuses on the operations conducted by the 82nd Us Airborne division. During the first (night time) game turns, the American player had to regroup his scattered forces in order to re-form companies and regiments. as long as this reorganization remains undone, American troops remain very vulnerable and the american player cannot know which objectives are in priority.<br/><br/>The German player can use the opportunity to create even more disorder in the American ranks, or chase after isolated paratroopers. But the surprise of the airborne assault keeps the Germans blind to the objectives of their adversaries. As daylight comes, the German player slowly begins to learn the intentions of the American troops and can better organize as reinforcements arrive.<br/><br/>For the American player, the knowledge of his objectives and the strength of his units give him the advantage over his enemies. The superiority from which he benefits allows him to bluff his opponent by attacking lesser important objectives, obliging the German player to make some critical choices: continue to defend a hex of middling importance and risk abandoning a more important hex, or focus on defending more important hexes and risk having been &quot;fooled&quot; by the enemy! The randomness of the drop, the priority assigned to each objective, and the arrival of German reinforcements assures a different game each time.<br/><br/>140 counters<br/>17&quot; x 22&quot; map<br/>6 pages rules booklet<br/><br/>Scale: 1 counter = 1 American company or 1 German section/company<br/>1 game turn = 1 hour<br/>1 hex = 400 meters<br/><br/>(source: publisher's description)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"104303": "First edition"}, "average": "7.3783", "name": "Night Drop: 6 June 44", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "0", "usersrated": "53", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"11006": "Country: France"}}, "101207": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Bionicle Heroes", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"104308": "Australian PlayStation 2 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1256703.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2468": "Children's"}, "videogamefranchise": {"8160": "Bionicle"}, "average": "2.875", "videogamegenre": {"2161": "Action Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4425": "GameCube"}, "usersrated": "4", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1256703_t.jpg", "description": "BIONICLE Heroes is the latest game from the team behind LEGO Star Wars.

Each player can choose their MEK (a hovering tank with special weapons and abilities). One player can play against 6 AI players and the occasional Boss, or two players can play against each other and 4 AI players. There is a special Tournament mode where two players can go one on one. Up to three T-Mek cabinets can be linked for six-player competitions. T-Mek was later ported to DOS and the Sega 32X; rather than linking multiple systems together, the home versions featured split-screen multiplayer for two players. The 32X version was poorly reviewed, while the DOS version was met with fair reviews.<br/><br/>Atari could not compete with the Japanese game manufacturers in hardware development, so T-Mek did not offer a great leap in graphics or computing capability. As a result, T-Mek was one of the first arcade games to offer an effective surround sound solution, which Atari euphemistically named &quot;CAGE Audio&quot;. Each player's station had four fairly high quality speakers; two in front and two behind the player, and a subwoofer mounted directly below the seat, which was quite effective in rattling a player in battle. T-Mek has no background music soundtrack, which was a departure for &quot;deluxe&quot; arcade games in the coming-of-age era of digitally sampled audio, and instead relied upon the sound to help aid the player in finding enemies.<br/><br/>"}, "101243": {"statistics": {}, "name": "ThunderJaws", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"104383": "Amiga Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1576129.png", "videogametheme": {"2283": "Spy / Espionage"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2314": "Arcade"}, "videogameplatform": {"4415": "Amiga"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1576129_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A spy shooter where you infiltrate the evil Madam Q's lair.

Hundreds of reporters flocked to the zone in hopes of getting a real scoop. Unfortunately for them, one of the reporters discovers that there's more than baby milk being made at the 'Baby Milk Factory'.<br/><br/>General Akhboob then captures the reporter, as well as all the remaining reporters in his country. It turns out that General Akhboob has been building an army of mutants and a stockpile of chemical weapons. He's also holding several American reporters and other civilians captive. It is up to the Doomsday Squad, composed of Captain Carnage (Player 1) and Major Mayhem (Player 2), to invade Akhboob's base, wipe out his forces, destroy the mutants, rescue all the hostages and capture Akhboob.<br/><br/>Along the way, Captain Carnage and Major Mayhem fight various mutants and monsters, a giant mutant cyborg named Orcus, and eventually General Ahkboob himself. Ahkboob transforms into several forms, including a series of three giant heads. After his defeat, he attempts to escape by releasing a swarm of copies, but is captured and executed by electric chair.<br/><br/>The Doomsday Squad then decides to take a military leave to the Midway Pleasure Domes, a grotesque amusement park. The player(s) can only access this area if they collected 220 keys during the game. It is strongly hinted at that if one collects every item in the Midway Pleasure Domes something special will happen, but this is impossible if not very near to impossible.<br/><br/>"}, "101283": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Ultimate Arctic Thunder", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"104469": "NA Arcade Edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2456": "Driving"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2314": "Arcade"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A sequel to Arctic Thunder with new tracks and vehicles.

Originally released in Japanese arcades in April 2007, the title was ported to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 home consoles in Japan in May 2008, with a North American Xbox 360-exclusive version released in English in September 2008 by Aksys Games. It was later released in Europe in March 2009 for both systems by 505 Games. The game's development was headed by Emiko Iwasaki, who had previously served as illustrator for the company's Guilty Gear series, and utilizes three-dimensional character models restricted to two-dimensional battlefields. Battle Fantasia retains a number of features of its predecessor including fast-paced gameplay, colorful anime-style graphics, and over-the-top effects, yet was designed to be a more basic representation of the fighting genre.<br/><br/>The game is notable for its stylistic departure from many fighting games, and is set in a fantasy world depicted as a storybook, and borrows many superficial elements from role-playing games including damage represented as numbers and a text-heavy story mode, which involves a number of heroes answering the call to battle to stop an evil force from once again attempting to destroy the world. Battle Fantasia met with relatively low sales in Japan and received mostly average reviews from critics due the title's minimal marketing and lack of robust console features.<br/><br/>"}, "101307": {"rpgitemversion": {"104545": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Legend of Wolfgang von Horn", "rpgproducer": {"17188": "Wim van Gruisen"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1021104.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": {"272": "Warhammer World"}, "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpg": {"276": "Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (2nd Edition)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"10992": "Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 2007 Scenario Contest"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1021104_t.jpg", "description": "Writer Blurb:<br/><br/>This adventure is written for the WFRP Scenario Competition 2007.

It can be run independently or inserted into an existing campaign. It is a rural adventure, involving social interaction amongst commoners, outdoors travel and some magic. A party without stealth skills will have a very hard time. Familiarity with Greenskins and someone with Magical Sense would help but are by no means necessary. Careful roleplayers can complete the adventure with only one easy combat. Clumsy ones and/or PCs with an overwhelming hatred of Goblinoids (e.g. an uncontrollably deranged Trollslayer) will find themselves losing Fate Points in a full-scale battle. While most kinds of characters will have something to contribute, very urban-focussed or upper-class characters will need careful roleplaying and gamesmastering.<br/><br/>The adventure can take place in any hilly area within a day&rsquo;s travel of a town on a major river, although if the campaign is set after the Storm of Chaos it should be placed towards the West and South of the Empire where the economy is relatively undisturbed. It takes place in late summer or early autumn. The players will need to show initiative to get the most out of the adventure. The first part is linear, but with numerous roleplaying opportunities during which the PCs can learn what is going on. What they discover will then inform their decisions in the much more open conclusion. Completion should take 2-4 sessions (8-16 hours of play).<br/><br/>"}, "101328": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Chase Bombers", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"104611": "NA Arcade Edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2456": "Driving"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2314": "Arcade"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Another race game from Taito.

It was released in 2005 in Japan and North America. Capcom partnered with Nintendo to distribute the game in Europe and Australia in early 2006. Viewtiful Joe: Double Trouble! is the fourth game released in the Viewtiful Joe series. The game's story opens on the set of director Captain Blue's new action movie in an amusement park called Movieland. When a mysterious group of villains known as Madow steal the only copy of the film, the superhero Viewtiful Joe and his younger sister Jasmine quickly give chase.<br/><br/>Gameplay in Viewtiful Joe: Double Trouble! is a mix of the platforming and beat 'em up video game genres. The DS touchscreen is a key feature of the game's controls, enabling players to utilize Viewtiful Joe's unique VFX powers in order to battle enemies and solve puzzles. These include being able to split the level in half horizontally or to swap the top screen to the touchscreen and vice versa. The game was relatively well received by critics, but it sold poorly.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Viewtiful Joe: Double Trouble!&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "101341": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Ultimate Band", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"104674": "EU DS Release"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2316": "Music"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2163": "Rhythm"}, "videogameplatform": {"4734": "Nintendo DS"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Ultimate Band allows players to play guitar, drums, bass or be the front man or woman in a band (though vocals are not supported).

For example, to play notes on guitar in the Wii version the player must press a button combination on the Nunchuk while strumming the Wii Remote up and down.

The game was developed under the direction of comedian-turned actor and film director Takeshi Kitano (Beat Takeshi), and was only released in Japan on December 10, 1986; according to a Taito Corporation source, 80,000 copies were sold.<br/><br/>Kitano incorporated many of his unique and controversial ideas into the game. For instance, the player can beat up a yakuza gangster at a pachinko gambling establishment, and take the yakuza's money to exchange for prizes. The player can use a hang-glider to fly over into a strange land called the &quot;Red Country&quot; (an amalgam between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany). The player can gain access to the Red Country if they pass over the four other islands, but a huge mountain blocks the way into the country, and the player will be forced to crash into either the mountain or the ground, resulting in an automatic game over screen. There is also a choice on the password-entry screen (&quot;Punch the old man&quot;) which also results in an automatic game over, even when the player has not even started the game. Other in-game events include: a game over screen where the player's character is given a funeral, singing karaoke at a pub (using the second-controller's built-in microphone), the main character divorcing his wife and paying a settlement, beating up yakuza, or seeing inhumane comments on store signs.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Takeshi no Ch\u014dsenj\u014d&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "101399": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Heavy Unit", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogameversion": {"104775": "NA Arcade Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1556294.png", "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2314": "Arcade"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1556294_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>In this horizontal shoot 'em up, use your gun to shoot many ugly aliens to progress from level to level.

This edition is very similar to SoulCalibur IV, although it removes the Star Wars characters while adding in Kratos from God of War.<br/><br/>This game features 29 different playable characters. There are five different modes from which the player can choose: Quick Match (drops the player right into a fight), Trials Mode (which pits the player against opponents one after the other until the player is defeated), Versus (ad hoc battle between two players over wireless connection), Training (which allows the player to practice moves against an immobile opponent), and Gauntlet (this main &quot;story&quot; mode of the game ). The game also features the ability to customize existing characters, or to create your own.<br/><br/>The Gauntlet mode of the game is the longest portion. It is based on a non-canonical SoulCalibur story in which the player's chosen character follows Hilde around the world in search of medicine for her ailing father. Each encounter in this mode is mission-based and the player must discover the criteria that will allow them to be successful.<br/><br/>"}, "101488": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1729850.png", "poll": {}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1987", "maxplayers": "6", "age": "14", "boardgamepublisher": {"38": {"name": "Schmidt Spiele"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1729850_t.png", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "description": "This expansion for Lerne M\u00fcnchen kennen contains 300 new trivia cards on the city of M&uuml;nchen.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"105094": "German first edition"}, "name": "Lerne M\u00fcnchen kennen: 300 neue Fragen", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "average": "4.5", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "2", "expands": {"100877": {"name": "Lerne M\u00fcnchen kennen"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"17621": "Cities: M\u00fcnchen"}}, "101489": {"videogame": {"105100": "Activision Anthology"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Checkers", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"105095": "North American Atari 2600 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1619290.png", "videogametheme": {"2403": "Board Game"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "7.5", "videogamegenre": {"2402": "Classic Games"}, "videogameplatform": {"4416": "Atari 2600"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"105100": "Activision Anthology"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1619290_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Basic game of checkers for Atari 2600<br/><br/>"}, "101490": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Worldwide Soccer - Sega International Victory Goal Edition", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"105103": "North American Sega Saturn edition"}, "average": "7", "videogametheme": {"2373": "Sports - Soccer"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4439": "SEGA Saturn"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Sega Worldwide Soccer, produced by Sega themselves was one of the killer apps in the peak of popularity for the console.
