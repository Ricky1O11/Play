Players control a young London boy named Eddie and his compatriots as they travel across an alternate history 19th-century Earth on a high-powered zeppelin, visiting various locales and raiding ruins in order to uncover the truth about an ancient civilization, as well as find Eddie's lost father. In order to advance the story, players must visit towns and interact with non-player characters to obtains clues on their next destination, as well as traverse dangerous dungeons and environments in order to find hidden treasures. Taking advantage of the Nintendo DS's dual screens, gameplay is featured on one screen while a map of the player's current location is present on the other, which fills as they travel through new areas. While traveling through the game, the player will randomly encounter enemies as they move through dangerous areas, which must be defeated in battle.<br/>Battles in Nostalgia use a turn-based combat system where both characters and enemies acting in an order relative to their &quot;speed&quot; statistic. A Combat Order bar is present in battles that shows which of the player's party members or enemies will act next, with the player selecting a character's command just before their turn. In any given turn, a player may choose to attack an enemy, defend, use an item for beneficial effects, or use special skills unique to each character. In addition to ground battles, a player may also encounter enemies while in their airship, leading to a ship-to-ship combat sequence with unique commands. Players must defeat all of their enemies by attacking them until their hit points are extinguished, which grants each character experience points that go towards gaining levels, thus making them stronger and giving them access to more abilities. The player's party is judged at the end of each battle with a letter grade based on their actions in combat, and is determined by how quickly and flawlessly they have defeated their enemies and may give additional rewards.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Nostalgia (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "113003": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Shrek 2 (GBA)", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"136517": "North American Game Boy Advance edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"6170": "Shrek"}, "videogametheme": {"2335": "Fairy Tale"}, "videogamefranchise": {"6169": "Shrek"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2161": "Action Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4423": "Game Boy Advance"}, "videogamehonor": {"32637": "2006 British Academy Game Awards Best Family/Children's Game of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Box Description:<br/><br/>The adventure continues!<br/><br/>...With all new characters and far-out locations never seen before!<br/><br/>-Switch between Shrek and 4 of his pals - each with their own powers.<br/><br/>"}, "113004": {"rpgitemversion": {"136809": "HTML Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Starfarer Player's Guide", "rpgproducer": {"41680": "Alan D.

There is an ending to this game. However, reaching the end requires considerable patience because it only comes out at the end of level 999 (approximately 28 repetitions of the game's thirty-six levels).<br/><br/>Each level represents a season in the ecosystem of a bird. The game starts out in early spring. As the virtual year progresses, the season evolves into summer and eventually into autumn. After autumn, the game repeats itself by portraying the following spring. Since harmful influences from sentient beings are not simulated in the game play, the forest that the birds live in is presumed to be a nature preserve. If the proper amount of butterflies are not fed to the babies, then the babies end up starving to death. The player will automatically lose a life if any of the baby bird dies. In addition to this, the player also loses a life when a predator catches the player trying to deliver butterflies to whose baby.[4]<br/><br/>Although the game is titled &quot;Bird Week,&quot; the flow of seasons make it seem like virtual years are passing by (as opposed to virtual days of a week).

Cars overtaken during this part of the level cause the player's rank to increment by 1 per car. The current rank is shown in the bottom right hand corner of the game screen during each stage.<br/>    The second part has the player watching the biker from behind his back. The player must try not to crash into the opposite cars while a background relative to the city he's travelling to is shown (i.e.: if the player is reaching Las Vegas, then a few casinos can be seen in the background). Oncoming cars passed do not increase the player's rank.<br/><br/>There are five different stages that the player encounters on their way to the final destination (NY) before the game starts back at stage one as outlined below. These stages alternate from tarmac on stages one, three and five, to unsealed (dirt) roads on stages two and four. On the tarmac stages bonus fuel can be picked up by running over the gas can icon. There is also a &quot;wheelie&quot; section which when run over causes the rider's bike to do a wheelstand and gain bonus points. On the dirt road stages both fuel and points can be gained by running over the gas cans or the score amounts indicated on the playfield. On the dirt road stage there are several log bridges that cross water and a &quot;jump&quot; section on some bridges - riding over the jump icon results in a score bonus. On all stages there are puddles of water which, if ridden through, render the bike unable to steer for a short period of time and a tyre squealing sound is played briefly.<br/><br/>Crashing into cars, road edges, bushes/trees, rocks or missing a bridge and riding into the water on a dirt road stage results in the motorcycle stopping and losing an amount of fuel. Running out of fuel causes the game to end. Crashing can also result (especially in later levels) in being overtaken by cars which decreases the player's rank.<br/><br/>As the player reaches each city the rank achieved results in a bonus amount being added to the score and extra fuel added to the player's total. The higher the position achieved the more points and fuel awarded.<br/><br/>When the player reaches NY, a sign saying &quot;Viva NY&quot; will be shown while the Statue of Liberty waves its hand and the Star Spangled Banner is played. After this cut-scene, the game starts again with an increased difficulty and the player has a higher capacity motorcycle (with correspondingly faster top speed).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Zippy Race&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "113030": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Shrek 2: Beg For Mercy!", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"136582": "North American Game Boy Advance edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"6170": "Shrek"}, "videogametheme": {"2335": "Fairy Tale"}, "videogamefranchise": {"6169": "Shrek"}, "videogamegenre": {"2161": "Action Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4423": "Game Boy Advance"}, "usersrated": "0", "poll": {}, "description": "Box Description:<br/><br/>The tale of Puss In Boots<br/><br/>-Take on sword fights, acrobatics and combo attacks.<br/><br/>-Use a variety of cool moves to battle enemies.<br/><br/>-Play as Puss In Boots or one of his friends in over 20 levels.<br/><br/>"}, "113031": {"rpgitemversion": {"136583": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Spiral", "rpgproducer": {"54032": "Michael Tangherlini"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1158072.png", "usersrated": "1", "average": "4", "rpggenre": {"962": "Multiverse"}, "rpg": {"14773": "Spiral"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1158072_t.png", "description": "Premise<br/>The system is open: it&rsquo;s just a frame of rules that will let you play in different environments.

They learned that these ancients simultaneously built pyramids towards the sky and had an extensive knowledge of the stars. It was rumored that perhaps they were the original colonizers and space-farers of the first human age.<br/><br/>Now, at the edge of a colossal black hole, a pyramid-craft known as the Zoneplex has emerged with legendary markings and glyphs of the deep past. The known empires have sent their elite warrior-monk mystics on a one-way mission to gain control of the Zoneplex, to emerge victorious and ultimately control the pathways of the universe and time itself.<br/><br/>Zoneplex is a game that combines a tile-laying/exploration mechanism, a collaborative battle system and a zone control system to create an intriguing adventure in an alien pyramid.<br/><br/>The game works in 2 phases with the first phase players not counting Influence points until the pyramid is completed.<br/><br/>In phase 1 players strategically lay tiles determined by action cards to build their pathway through the Zoneplex pyramid whilst being cognizant of the Sacred Symbol card that they are bestowed with before the game begins.

In the early stages of the arc, the character appears to be in control of her new powers, or at the very least, capable of learning control, but as time wears on, the situation worsens. The character&rsquo;s newfound abilities affect such profound change in her that her allies, even her closest friends, may no longer recognize her. As her powers continue to grow, her self-control dwindles, and her very humanity suffers. When, in a fit of madness, she steps over the line, using her newfound powers to commit some heinous crime, the other characters must decide whether their teammate is capable (or even worthy) of redemption. If you are looking to build an epic level adventure in the OGL &amp; D20 genre, then this is the PDF for you. Best of all it is OGL and D20, so you can use it with the world most popular RPG rule set and should be easily compatible with any OGL and D20 Superhero genre based systems on the market today.

In 1943 Barrington was commissioned by the US government to expand the contents of the database as part of Project Overwatch, an early task-force devoted to curtailing the rise of criminal masterminds and super-humans who had appeared during the early days of the decade.<br/><br/>The database survived the decommissioning of Project Overwatch in 1957, becoming the basis of the independent super-human studies center known as OMNILabs. Since that time OMNI-Labs has maintained the Database as an independent entity, leasing its contents to the US State Department, the secret service and international law enforcement agencies such as Interpol in exchange for the opportunity to study and catalogue the powers of captured criminals.<br/><br/>The OMNI-Database is a comprehensive listing of every super-powered being and advanced technology that has been encountered since the 1940s. Maintained by a powerful A.I program and stored in a heavily fortified structure deep in the Nevada desert, it is the most complete listing of superhuman powers and activities known to mankind.<br/><br/>A less comprehensive version of OMNI is also available for private use, often accessed by independent super-heroes, corporations and super-hero fans to get the latest information about the meta-human world. An individual with access to the internet and a credit card can search the database by name or code name, key word, costume, power or any of a hundred other qualifiers, performing a rapid survey of the eight hundred thousand entries in OMNI&rsquo;s databanks.<br/><br/>"}, "113120": {"rpgitemversion": {"136739": "PDF version"}, "rpgseries": {"3500": "M&M Superlink"}, "name": "San Angelo: City of Heroes 1.5", "rpgproducer": {"15630": "Mark Arsenault"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1151824.png", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": {"9655": "San Angelo"}, "average": "10", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"2523": "Action!

Experience points are used as currency to buy all character traits resulting in a &quot;classless&quot; system. Unlike other attempts at a point buy system, Custom Characters bases trait costs on your character's level, not the trait level. This results in experience point progressions that closely mirror those found in class-based OGL fantasy games.<br/><br/>Custom Characters contains:<br/><br/><br/>     Rules for Character Generation and Advancement<br/><br/><br/>In Custom Characters, players use XP like currency to buy their characters' traits. Starting with an initial allotment of XP, players build their starting characters to the exact specifications they desire. As players earn XP during play, new traits can be bought when desired (and, of course, when the GM allows!). Players don't have to wait for &quot;level breaks&quot; to see improvement in their characters' abilities. And the best thing is that the character building system in Custom Characters is much simpler than previously offered fare. All trait costs are calculated by multiplying the base cost for a trait by the character's level. Easy!<br/><br/><br/>     Over 300 Special Abilities<br/><br/><br/>Class special abilities for all of the basic and prestige classes found in the SRD are detailed, allowing you to pick and choose exactly what abilities you want your character to possess. Logical prerequisites are listed for each class special ability. Rules are included on how to bring new class special abilities found in other rulebooks into the Custom Characters system.<br/><br/><br/>     Seven New Generic Character Classes<br/><br/><br/>Expanding upon the generic classes found in the SRD, seven new character classes are built from the ground up. The combatant, the expert, the spellcaster, the specialist, the gish, the zerth, and the polymath are detailed and used to illustrate how creative gamemasters can apply the principles of Custom Characters to create unique character classes for their campaigns.<br/><br/><br/>     Spontaneous, Free-Form Magic System<br/><br/><br/>Many game supplements have attempted to introduce a spontaneous spellcasting system for OGL-based games, with varying success. Most systems of &quot;spell-building&quot; are extremely complicated and require an inordinate amount of bookkeeping. Custom Characters contains an extremely simple system for spontaneous spellcasting that can be easily dropped into any campaign that requires no bookkeeping on the part of the players or gamemaster.<br/><br/><br/>     Two Alternate Experience Point Award Systems<br/><br/><br/>Custom Characters offers two new ways to award experience points. The first is a simplified award system that continues to advance characters one &quot;level equivalent&quot; for every 13 or 14 evenly-matched encounters. The second system awards experience for characters who take long amounts of time off between adventures. This &quot;blue-booking&quot; system allows characters to continue to improve their abilities over time, even if adventures are separated by weeks, months, or years.<br/><br/><br/>     Level-by-Level Breakdowns of the Eleven Basic Character Classes<br/><br/><br/>No free-form character building system is worth its salt if can't build the normal character classes accurately. Custom Characters provides a level-by-level analysis of the experience points required to advance characters along a single class. Experience point totals falling within the proper range for each level occur 85.5% of the time and are never more than one level away in any case. In this respect, Custom Characters is the most accurate &quot;point buy&quot; character building system for OGL-based games on the market.<br/><br/><br/>     Conclusion<br/><br/><br/>Emphasizing simplicity and a minimum of bookkeeping, Custom Characters is an easy, rules-lite way to introduce a free-form, point-buy character building system into your OGL-based fantasy campaign.<br/><br/>"}, "113159": {"poll": {}, "name": "Was lebt da in der Stadt?", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "yearpublished": "2001", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1165263_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"127": {"name": "Klee"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1165263.png", "boardgameversion": {"136829": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Objective: be the first to find all requested (cards) stuff (animals &amp; plants) - learn more about your surrounding enviroment<br/>roll the die, move around the board, draw cards  fulfilling/finding the things on your to-do-list<br/>proper method to learn, that there are more animals like cats, dogs, doves ... nice images<br/><br/>1 board<br/>1 rules<br/>4 meeples<br/>1 die<br/>5 replacement cards<br/>6 'disorder' cards<br/>40 animal cards<br/><br/>"}, "113160": {"poll": {}, "name": "Hoppla Hexenbr\u00fccke", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"4214": "Pachisi-Ludo"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1165276_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"7388": {"name": "Trends Ltd."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1165276.png", "boardgameversion": {"136831": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Objective: be the first to move all of your 4 meeples home<br/> - simple 'Roll &amp; Move' game, similar to Pachisi -<br/> - moving by turn -<br/>the game differs from Pachisi that the circle you are moving on is bridged (4x2 holes); if your die shows only small numbers or you choose the wrong meeple - it is going to fall into the river<br/><br/>"}, "113161": {"rpgitemversion": {"136836": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Basic d20", "rpgproducer": {"54069": "Erick Lee Edwards"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1152434.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"14785": "Basic d20"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpggenre": {"173": "Generic / Universal"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1152434_t.png", "description": "From the Introduction:<br/><br/>Basic d20 is a simplified version of the d20 system suitable for use in any d20-based campaign.

Vital to any alignment system are rules to govern alignment shifts. Normally, it is left to the DM to decide if a player portrays his character's alignment correctly. If the player's roleplaying is found lacking, then the DM must use his own judgment, and the few guidelines given in the rulebooks, to decide if an alignment shift is appropriate. There are no game mechanics to fall back on.<br/><br/>In this system, both the ethical (law-chaos) and moral (good-evil) components of alignment are given a score on a scale of 0 to 20. The number 10 represents neutrality on both axes. Scores of 20 indicate a maximum of law and good, while scores of 0 indicate a maximum of chaos and evil. Thus, a thoroughly chaotic good character would have an ethics score of 0 and a morality score of 20. Conversely, a diabolically lawful evil character would have a 20 in ethics and a 0 in morality.<br/><br/>"}, "113170": {"rpgitemversion": {"136862": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Basic d20 Rules Checklist", "rpgproducer": {"54069": "Erick Lee Edwards"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1152449.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"14785": "Basic d20"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpggenre": {"173": "Generic / Universal"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1152449_t.png", "description": "From the Introduction:<br/><br/>It is quite obvious that Basic d20 is simply a modified version of Mutants & Masterminds that uses various optional rules from the Mastermind's Manual.

Decisions of the Security Council on procedural matters shall be made by an affirmative vote of nine members.<br/><br/>In this negotiation game, each player represents one member of the UN Security Council and will both present and be presented with different proposals.<br/><br/>In each round, one player acts as the UN Secretary General, presents a proposal to the Council and presides over a negotiation period that lasts no more than five minutes. The proposal will affect five issues &ndash; military, currency, etc. &ndash; in various ways, and each player has a secret document for the round that tells him how a change in each issue will affect him. All players openly negotiate on what they need in terms of points and bribes in order to vote for that proposal.<br/><br/>After at most five minutes, the Secretary General closes negotiations by banging his wooden gavel, then players vote yes or no on the proposal. Any &quot;no&quot; vote kills the proposal, as in the United Nation's actual Security Council &ndash; but vetoing a proposal costs a player points, so he might prefer to look for deals that will enable him to say &quot;yes&quot;. The Secretary General scores a bonus when his proposal succeeds, so he and others who will benefit might be willing to negotiate to make the proposal sweet for all.<br/><br/>After each player has served as Secretary General once (twice in a three-player game), each player scores based on bribe money on hand, points scored from proposal cards, and how well the player fulfilled the secret agenda card he received at the start of the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"137131": "English first edition"}, "name": "Article 27: The UN Security Council Game", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2008": "Trading"}, "average": "6.54958", "usersrated": "749", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "age": "10"}, "113294": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3328521.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"149809": "Escape: Zombie City"}, "is_expanded_by": {"132128": {"name": "Escape: The Curse of the Temple \u2013 Doomed"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"4063": {"name": "Kristian Amundsen \u00d8stby"}}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamecompilation": {"157820": "Escape: The Curse of the Temple \u2013 Big Box"}, "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"34863": "Oliver Schlemmer"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"47": {"name": "Queen Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3328521_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"22750": "2012 Meeples' Choice Nominee"}, "description": "Escape: The Curse of the Temple is a cooperative game in which players must escape (yes...) from a temple (yes...) which is cursed (yes...) before the temple collapses and kills one or more explorers, thereby causing everyone to lose.<br/><br/>The initial game board consists of a row of three square tiles, each showing a combination of two symbols, say, two green adventurers or one green adventurer and one blue key in one corner of the tile. All of the explorers start in the center tile &ndash; the safe room &ndash; and each player starts with a hand of five dice. Each die has five symbols:<br/><br/><br/>    A cursed mask &ndash; this die is set aside when rolled.<br/>    A golden mask &ndash; each such symbol counteracts two cursed masks, either your own or those of another explorer in the same room.<br/>    A red torch or blue key &ndash; these are used to enter rooms, access treasure, or activate gems.<br/>    A green adventurer, which appears twice on the die &ndash; you need these to move from room to room, and to activate some gems.<br/><br/><br/>Escape is played in real-time, with all players rolling dice and taking actions simultaneously. You must roll the right symbols to enter a room, and if you're at an open doorway, you can roll to reveal the next tile in the stack and add it to that doorway. Some rooms contain combinations of red and blue symbols, and if you (possibly working with other players in the same room) roll enough red or blue symbols, you &quot;discover&quot; magic gems, moving them from a separate gem depot onto that tile.<br/><br/>The real-time aspect is enforced by a soundtrack to be played during the game. At certain points, a countdown starts, and if players aren't back in the safe room when time is up, they lose one of their dice.<br/><br/>Once the exit tile is revealed, players can attempt to escape the temple by moving to that tile, then rolling a number of blue dice equal to the magic gems that haven't been removed from the gem depot. Thus, the more gems you find, the easier it is to escape the temple. When a player escapes, he gives one die to a player of his choice. If all players escape before the third countdown, everyone wins; if not, everyone loses, no matter how many players did escape.<br/><br/>Escape: The Curse of the Temple includes two expansion modules that can be used individually or together. With the &quot;Treasures&quot; module, some rooms contain treasure, and when you reveal such a room, you place a face-down treasure chest on the tile. Roll the symbols on that chest tile, and you claim the treasure for use later: a key lets you teleport anywhere, a path lets you connect two rooms that otherwise have no door between them, and a medic kit heals all players instantly (putting black dice back into play). With the &quot;Curses&quot; module, some tiles &quot;curse&quot; players by forcing them to place one hand on their head, keep mute during play, or otherwise do what you wouldn't want to do while escaping a temple!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"203562": "English-only first edition"}, "average": "7.0988", "name": "Escape: The Curse of the Temple", "playingtime": "10", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "11853", "boardgameaccessory": {"138571": "Escape: Adventurer Stickers"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"21940": "Archaeology"}}, "113295": {"boardgamedesigner": {"54105": {"name": "Jakob Andrusch"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Affenzirkus", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"7178": "Animals: Apes / Monkeys"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1205654_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"54106": "G\u00fcnther Jacobs"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4750": {"name": "Die Spiegelburg"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1205654.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"137135": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Affenzirkus is a dexterity card game for children.<br/>The game contais 49 cards with animals.<br/>All the cards are placed face down on the tabel.

Players build a 'city of promise' by building their civilization with important structures and with valuable characters that then defend the city from corruption's power.<br/><br/>Building Cards - Throughout the deck are Building Cards. To build structures for the 'cities of promise' and to use important historical figures within the cities, a player  must try to collect specific cards and in the right amounts. Some cards cost more than others and the value of the cards vary in power. Players who gain the right building cards pay the cost of the card and a new part of the city is then added.<br/><br/>Game Timer - Corruption Cards play as timing cards and determine when the game ends. When the 18th Corruption Card is placed down the game ends for all players.<br/><br/>Each player add up their cities power points. If the total is greater than the total points of Corruption Power Points  then they have WON! Yes, that's right, there can be more than one winner in this game making it more rewarding for the whole family. And if the friendly competition is that HIGH you can find out who's city had the most strength and they can be the Grand Winner!<br/><br/>Types of Cards<br/><br/>Corruption Cards - New cards are drawn at the beginning of every turn. Any time a Corruption Card is drawn it must be played during the player's turn and added to the Corruption Card area (typically the middle between all players).<br/><br/>Building a City - Players that purchase City Cards with the Build Cards will be able to piece the city together in any combination left to right or right to left. As players strive to get the better City Cards it may be necessary to discard unwanted or undesirable City Cards in the hopes of gaining a better one on the next draw.<br/><br/>Specialty Characters - Character Cards can be added to your city by purchasing them with the Build Cards and then placing them under the correct City Card they belong to. These cards also have a power point value so players can seek to add the best characters to their city to give it the best advantage.<br/><br/>Bonus Power Points - Saints Cards, Resources Cards, and Faith &amp; Works Cards can be stored under Character Cards for later purchases of City Cards and Character Cards.

One captain and crew will emerge triumphant, and the loser will be damned to stalk the bowels of Davy Jones' locker.<br/><br/>Ghost Pirates is a tactical board game in which two ghost pirate Captains encounter each other on the high seas; based on old rivalries, grudges, or whatever it was that happened on Skull Island, they each turn broadside and lay-to. Each crew, following captain's orders, fights, fires cannons, and swarms their enemy's deck, attempting to force the other captain to walk the plank. Each player's turn consists of drawing a card, playing one or more cards to strengthen their ship and tactical position, moving your pirate crew, and finally, having them fight the foeman or take advantage and pillage the enemy&rsquo;s ship. The goal of the game is to force your opponent&rsquo;s captain to walk the plank.<br/><br/>Gameplay is designed to emulate tactical melee battles with a unique dice mechanic that is easy to learn and quick to play, especially for beginning gamers. It bears certain similarities to wargames like Axis and Allies, but on a much smaller, more fast-paced scale. The components are 72 cards which build the play layout and form the draw deck, 34 crew tokens, and a small handful of pirate themed six-sided dice.<br/><br/>Ghost Pirates was named to the 2013 GAMES 100 list, nominated for Best Family Game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"137198": "English first edition"}, "average": "6.09048", "name": "Ghost Pirates", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "42", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "113312": {"boardgamedesigner": {"27568": {"name": "Jordi Gen\u00e9"}}, "average": "5.56462", "statistics": {}, "name": "Grill Party", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "106", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1164031_t.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"137206": "German first edition"}, "boardgameartist": {"11825": "Michael Menzel"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"37": {"name": "KOSMOS"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1164031.jpg", "boardgamefamily": {"5841": "Food / Cooking"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "poll": {}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "It's barbecue time, so call your friends and tell them to bring the ingredients to grill!<br/><br/>In Grill Party, each player has a deck of twenty cards depicting the conditions for the meal &ndash; e.g., &quot;More Steaks than Corn&quot;, &quot;More Fish than Steaks&quot;, &quot;No Fish&quot;, &quot;More Wurst than anything&quot; &ndash; and a set of wooden tokens: fish, corn, wurst and steak.<br/><br/>On your turn, you can exchange one token from your hand with one token on the central barbecue or in the possession of another player, then play as many cards from your hand as you can that meet the condition depicted.

They're not concerned about which horse wins, however, so much as making as much money as possible from the bets they place based on which race cards they hold in hand.<br/><br/>Each turn is divided into two phases: the bidding and the race. During each race two players will be the bookmakers, the ones who set the odds on the four horses. At the start of the race, four race cards from the deck of 80 cards are turned face-up, while each player (including each bookmaker) is dealt four race cards face down. Players look at these cards to determine which cards are out of play &ndash; that is, which horses are less likely to move during the race. The bookmakers secretly exchange two cards each to give them extra information.<br/><br/>Then the bookmakers individually set odds on the four horses (1:1, 1:2, and so on, with the total of the second numbers adding to at least ten). They reveal these odds to the other players, who must then place at least one bet with one bookmaker. They can place more bets if desired, even with both bookmakers. Each bookmaker records the amount bet and the odds for that horse, and he can then lower the odds on that horse if desired (but if the total of the odds would drop below ten, he must raise the payoff on another horse. Players continue placing bets as long as they want.<br/><br/>Once all bets are finished, players remove all cards from play, then reveal cards from the top of the deck one-by-one, moving the appropriately colored horse forward one space for each card revealed. Whichever horse reaches the #10 spot on the track first wins. All players who bet on this horse are paid off in the appropriate amount from the bookmakers. During the race, the betters can ask for credit from the bank to spend and win more money &ndash; but of course in the end, they will be forced to pay the money back to the bank with interest!<br/><br/>After an agreed upon number of races, with each player being bookmaker the same number of times, whoever has the most money wins!<br/><br/>Variant rules in Bookmaker add wild race cards that move the horse which moved on the previous turn, a bet on which horse is the nag, and a harness option in which horses can break from the track and be disqualified.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"137289": "Multilingual first edition"}, "age": "12", "name": "Bookmaker", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "average": "5.78", "usersrated": "25", "boardgamefamily": {"5730": "Sports: Horse Racing"}}, "113334": {"boardgamedesigner": {"35872": {"name": "Craig Cartmell"}}, "average": "7.58333", "poll": {}, "name": "In the Emperor's Name", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "6", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1696406_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"30205": "Joseph Urban"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"14743": {"name": "Gawd 'elp us Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1696406.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"137291": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "This fan made miniatures game uses the setting of Warhammer 40,000 but the game represents fights between squads with a leader and a handful of troops, each controlled individually.

During the side-scrolling levels, the player's objective is to locate and retrieve all future objects (gray boxes with a flashing light on top, that, when broken open, look like endoskulls.) and complete all objectives for that mission. Once all objectives are completed, the player goes back to the beginning of the level to finish the mission. Between the side-scrolling levels are the driving levels.

The game is part of the Thunder Force series. It is a port of the dually copyrighted Technosoft/Sega arcade game Thunder Force AC, which itself is actually a modified port of the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis game Thunder Force III. The SNES version does away with level selection, changes several levels, and features a modified soundtrack, which takes advantage of the digitized instrument capabilities of the SPC700. Some of the graphics are considered improved compared to those two games, and some are worse. The Sega co-copyright could be why the game itself isn't called Thunder Force AC on the SNES.<br/><br/>A super-powered starship is under attack, and the pilot has to maneuver it over all sorts of terrain to make it out alive. Eight intergalactic stages make up the action in this fierce test of strength and agility. You'll have lots of powerful weapons to help you along the way, but firestorms and dangerous enemies should provide ample challenges to keep you on the edge of your seat.

The game takes place in 2045, when the Tiamatians, intelligent alien beings from planet Tiamat, discover a sort of space-time portal -or &quot;rift&quot;, as it is called in the game- that interconnects their homeworld with Earth. Meanwhile, human astronomers discover the same rift, but are not aware of the existence of Tiamat. They also discover that the rift is growing in a geometric rate. As they try to study it, the Tiamatians launch an exploratory probe, named &quot;Torquemada II&quot;, in order to find a planet similar to Tiamat; the probe soon finds Earth and sends information back to Tiamat.<br/><br/>As Earth astronomers continue studying the space-time rift in 2047, the Tiamat leadership agrees to send explorers to Earth. It turns out that Tiamatians are planning to conquest Earth to convert it into &quot;Tiamat II.&quot; However, Tiamatians have learned that humans have highly developed fighting skills and a vast amount of weapons, and they obviously would not agree to be enslaved. Because the power of the human defense forces, they decide to change their strategy, abandoning a conventional, frontal attack on Earth forces (because they would likely face a high casualty rate and even a defeat) in favor of a plan focusing on a time-traveling technology. This plan consists in sending Tiamatian expeditionary forces to several historic ages, in order to interfere with the development of human weaponry.  By doing this, they can secure a victory by truncating the evolution of human weapons, leaving humankind with nothing but weak weapons and at the mercy of Tiamatian forces in the future.  But their carefully planned strategy has a flaw: it failed to take in count the human intellect.<br/><br/>As Tiamat expeditionary forces are dispatched, a group of scientists led by Dr. Vincent Gilgamesh unveils the prototype of a time-travelling machine.  Suddenly, Tiamatians launch an attack on the laboratory where Dr. Gilgamesh works; all but Dr. Gilgamesh are killed. Without having time to test the time-traveling machine, he decides to travel back in time to stop Tiamat's conquest plans. A battle between Dr. Gilgamesh and Tiamatians starts, and it is only a matter of time to decide who shall win.<br/><br/>The gameplay is similar to that of Contra III: The Alien Wars, although with simpler moves and nine lives, but no continues (as opposed to most games of this genre). The game's mechanic also features a TGS bar, or &quot;power bar&quot;, which must be filled with special time crystals before emptying; otherwise, the player will lose a life each time the bar empties. The TGS bar is a part of the time-traveling device, and must be filled frequently. The bar slowly empties itself and by being hurt by an enemy, so players must literally &quot;run for their lives&quot; and collect as many crystals they can. After scoring a given number of points, players are awarded extra lives.<br/><br/>Levels are long and full of enemies and traps; players may find themselves fending off lots of weak enemies before battling an oversized (albeit weak) sub-boss, only to face an even stronger, bigger level boss. Traps, in turn, are based on the technology available in each age. A common occurrence was to mistake a sub-boss for the level's boss, because both sub-bosses and level bosses always were oversized and strong.<br/><br/>Regular enemies include humans from past ages and Tiamatians; they often appear together. The game also features animals and mythical beings. Sets of traps are scattered all over the game, but are quite simple. Bosses and sub-bosses often take the appearance of oversized mythological figures, always adjusting to the age they appear on.<br/><br/>The player can use several weapons as laser guns, bombs, etc., which are collected as the game progresses. However, the player can lose its weapons after losing a life. It is also possible to use armored vehicles in some levels.<br/><br/>Unlike other games, there is no cheat code that extends the amount of lives, nor can the player adjust the difficulty level or the number of lives to start with. The game also lacked of continues or a saving mode, forcing the player to restart the game from the first level after running out of lives. After running out of lives, the game ended and a screen appeared announcing Dr. Gilgamesh's fate by ominously declaring &quot;You Failed. You Was Never Born. Earth Becomes Tiamat II&quot; (implying that the Tiamatian plan succeeded and that also intervened on Dr. Gilgamesh's life), as he fell into a whirlwind-like vortex.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Time Slip&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "113364": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Time Trax", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"137397": "North American SNES edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4440": "SNES"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Based on the Australian TV series, this video game for the Super NES console was released in the U.S. market by Malibu Games in April 1994 (although some sources list December 1993).

The main protagonist is a mechanical sheriff named Tin Star, who has a sidekick named Mo Crash. In the beginning, Tin Star and Mo ride on a stagecoach to a town called East Driftwood to stop the Bad Oil Gang and their leader, Black Bart, from committing crimes. While riding on a stagecoach, a member of the Bad Oil Gang wearing spring shoes, by name of Joe Twiddley, sees them inside of the stagecoach and tries to attack them along with his gang, but Tin Star defeats them, and the stagecoach makes it to East Driftwood more or less intact. Upon their arrival, the story begins when Tin Star tries to help the old lady carry her bags, she objects, shoves him and he accidentally steps on Tiny Johnson's award-winning geranium, setting in motion a vicious circle of vengeance and escalating confrontations with the local outlaws.<br/><br/>Tin Star was designed to be compatible not only with a standard Super NES controller, but also with the Super Scope and the SNES Mouse.<br/><br/>The gameplay contains levels titled as &quot;days&quot;. Each day is filled with four types of screens called &quot;scenes&quot;:<br/><br/>Training - Each day begins with a training session. Players can practice their gunslinging and try to rack up as much money as possible. Players can also test their aim by shooting the jugs on the screen. A jug will twirl up into the air when shot. As the jug comes down, players must shoot it again to &quot;juggle&quot; it and rack up loads of cash. A jug will break if it hits the bottom of the screen. The color of the jug also changes and will break when it becomes red for a while.<br/><br/>Action - In this type of scene, players must fight their way through such scenes as cattle stampedes, a train, a bank robbery, barroom brawls, jail breaks, etc., while shooting the members of the Bad Oil Gang as they appear on the screen. Some Action screens are first-person viewed, while some are third-person viewed. If players let them stay on the screen too long, they will shoot Tin Star. Players can shoot canteens to restore health. Some targets can be shot for extra money. Some of the action screens will also have a boss at the end of each third-person viewed, Action screen.<br/><br/>Showdown - At the end of each day, players usually have to face one member of the Bad Oil Gang in an old-fashioned quick draw gunfight. As players face down their adversary, they must watch for the &quot;Draw&quot; icon, which is shaped like the cylinder of a revolver, to appear. Players must quickly shoot the icon, and then shoot the opponent as fast as possible. Speed and accuracy are the most important in this scene.<br/><br/>Bonus Screens - To access these, players should not shoot a single canteen.

Ticonderoga) during the French and Indian War (1755-58). The game system emphasizes the importance of leaders, and highlights the role of individual command skills, circumstances and luck. Throughout the game, leaders&rsquo; skills are tested as their units maneuver and fight, and every leader has the capacity to be &ldquo;inept,&rdquo; &ldquo;capable&rdquo; or &ldquo;exceptional,&rdquo; varying from engagement to engagement.<br/><br/>The game includes a lot of randomization; so every game may vary in tempo. One game may involve more soldiers than another, and often the quality of the lower-level (unnamed) leaders will be different. There are three campaign and three raid scenarios, featuring many units for the longer games and fewer for shorter ones (280 counters total). Each hex on the Strategic Map represents 1.5 miles, whereas each hex on the Tactical Map (for the area near Ticonderoga) represents just 400 yards. Individual units represent from 50 to 800 men, and leader chits each represent a single commander, sometimes a famous historical figure, at other times an unknown man of low-rank.<br/><br/>Designed by William Nester and Eric R.

No more than one can bet on any one card. When all bets are placed, the first card is drawn. The player who bet on it must follow the instructions.<br/><br/>If the Banker role changes hands, a new deal shall be started. But Note: Sometimes a player's call against the Bank cannot be met.

The Reserve remains untouched. He starts a new Bank with 6 counters.<br/>Stake = This gives an advantage to the last player to have put down a stake of 6 counters to start a Bank.

It is our first production on such a large scale, only a couple years ago it was merely an amateur project started as a response to the huge success of Fallout. However, after a change of the game engine, with a new crew and finally a new producer, Nicolas Games, we have managed to put together a great team and complete the work this time at the level and quality that we always knew it deserved. Afterfall: InSanity is the most important project in the careers of many of our team members.<br/> The year is 2035. Almost 20 years ago the citizens of The Republic had to search for a shelter from the hell of the Third World War. Yet, only few were fortunate enough to have a place waiting for them in the prepared shelters. With the passage of time the fear of death on the surface has become only an unpleasant memory, however, the seemingly safe hideout has turned out to be a curse which cannot be escaped. It was only a matter of time before somebody would snap, and thus the dream of safety becomes a nightmare prison.<br/><br/>The protagonist of Afterfall: InSanity is a member of medical team which takes care of the mental and physical well-being of citizens living in the shelter. He specializes in the mental disorder caused by being locked-up for too long, yet he himself is not free of its symptoms. When all hell begins to break loose Albert has to find the answers to many questions, the where and the why, who is a real enemy and who a trusted friend.  He will have to face the dangers lurking in the darkness of the shelter and in Albert&rsquo;s own mind, battling with his own weaknesses and fears.<br/><br/>InSanity as a survival horror genre provides a healthy dose of fear and adrenaline to any lover of this particular game setting.  Deep in the underground, trapped in the claustrophobic space with no hope for escape, the shadows hide secrets more dark and terrifying than the madness that takes over residents of the shelter.<br/><br/>Albert will have to square off against countless riddles, monsters and difficult to make decisions. He has been given a challenging task. He will have to show superb reflexes, the ability of logical thinking and deduction, not to mention nerves of steel.<br/><br/>Play the game, overcome your fears, save the residents of the shelter and try to find a new safe harbor&hellip;<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "113499": {"boardgamedesigner": {"54161": {"name": "Lars Daneskov"}}, "average": "6.5", "poll": {}, "name": "Planken Ud Knud!", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2073": "Acting"}, "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "20", "boardgameartist": {"54157": "Morten Ingemann"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"19281": {"name": "Ekstra Bladets Forlag"}}, "boardgameversion": {"137840": "Danish first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1118": {"name": "Mature / Adult"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>Party game for grown ups.
