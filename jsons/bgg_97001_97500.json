Nada feels the dojo is under attack and the sword has something to do with it. You use your years of aikido practice to meet the challenges you face in your quest to solve the mystery of the sword.

Experienced players are seduced by its strategic turn-based fighting system, which is a rare feature in MMORPGs, while casual players are drawn to the game's accessibility.<br/><br/>And to top it all off, in spite of the dense diversity of the game world, DOFUS is no bigger than 150 Mbs in size - not many MMORPGs can boast such a lightweight download.<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>You can create a character from one of 15 races, each with its own spells. You advance in level by fighting monsters in turn-based tactical battles and doing quests. You can also learn professions to create magic items and earn money by trading with other players. As you increase in power you can focus on different characteristics and learn new spells or improve existing ones. Each race thus has many different paths to develop along depending on the player's preference and together with a huge variety of equipment, pets and mounts this means no two players are the same.<br/><br/>You can fight in teams, link together with friends in guilds, and fight other players in an alignment based player vs player system.

Because of the mature themes involved, reader discretion is advised.<br/><br/>Twilight Gothic is based upon the World of Darkness, used to describe the environment of Vampire - The Masquerade. For those of you who are new to the game, or have never before role-played, the World of Darkness is, quite simply the world in which you are now living. Human misery and suffering goes unnoticed by an uncaring community and those who are unfortunate enough to be born into poverty usually stay there. It is also a world run by the corporate machine. Vast intellectual businesses that control everything from your household telephone to television networks.<br/><br/>Yet there is another side to this bleak world... The supernatural. Far from being the stuff of fiction, the creatures of the supernatural involve themselves with our world in more ways that can be imagined. Werewolves run in packs through the forests, Wraiths and spirits haunt ruin and graveyard alike. While vampires live out their lives on the rain-washed streets of our cities.<br/><br/>The world of Twilight Gothic works on the fictional idea that vampires exist amongst us, lost in the faceless millions who inhabit the streets by night. Back stabbing and cruel, these creatures squabble and argue amongst themselves, whilst simultaneously trying to gather control of the mortals from which they feed.<br/><br/>Each player in Twilight Gothic builds a character for themselves - a vampire whose fate and fortunes they will play out. Once a character has been created the player is thrust into the Twilight Gothic World. The aim of the game? There is no aim. You are immersed in a world in which you are free to do as you wish; free to interact with other characters in whichever way you desire. But be warned - vampires are jealous creatures; as you build and enhance your character, others will plot your downfall. If you're lucky they will simply try to attack you. If you're unlucky, you'll never know they're there... until it's too late...<br/><br/>"}, "97037": {"videogame": {"106538": "Roads of Rome Double Pack"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Roads of Rome 2", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"139973": "Web Browser edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic971716.jpg", "videogameseries": {"12202": "Roads of Rome"}, "videogametheme": {"2600": "Ancient History"}, "usersrated": "2", "average": "3", "videogamegenre": {"2458": "Management"}, "videogameplatform": {"5084": "Web Browser"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"106538": "Roads of Rome Double Pack"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic971716_t.jpg", "description": "Super sequel - Roads of Rome 2!!!<br/>Take up new tricky tasks and overcome dangerous challenges in Roads of Rome 2, an addictive game that successfully combines strategy and time management features!<br/><br/>Caesar, the governor of Rome, has been poisoned, and there's no potion strong enough in the world of mortals that can cure him of his terrible disease.

The Third Reformation Church are locked in desperate battle against &quot;undead&quot; invaders known as the Rephaim.

To ensure a safe rescue, and make other kidnappers think twice about daring to use force against the Church and its officials, the Pope has personally ordered the Sacri Ordines to conduct a televised rescue mission. The orders for this quick adventure are brutally simple - rescue the prisoners, kill the kidnappers.<br/><br/>Three Short Adventures<br/><br/>When someone higher up the chain of command makes a mistake, it&rsquo;s left to the Knights to appear live on the Church&rsquo;s home-shopping channel to sell merchandize!

In the third adventure, a rescue mission leads to a terrifying discovery.<br/><br/>The Last Word<br/><br/>The Ordo is launching a recruitment drive at the Shrine of St. Malachy, a famous visionary from Earth&rsquo;s history, and the Knights are ordered to win over hearts and minds. In addition to the recruitment operation, the Knights must also liaise regarding security of the shrine with its permanent guardians, the militant nuns of the Sisters of Bradamante. What should be a quiet mission quickly breaks down into violence and mayhem. The theft of a precious relic by a force more powerful than anything the Knights have faced before leads them on a desperate mission.<br/><br/>The Broken Seal<br/><br/>Dark times call for dark measures! When the Preceptor Master summons you to his office in the middle of the night and swears you to secrecy before giving the mission briefing, you know this isn&rsquo;t going to be a routine operation.

Will anyone be left when the credits roll?<br/><br/>PostHumousZ is a team based zombie survival horror game. Each player controls a single human character or horde of themed zombies. A modular town is randomly laid out each game, with the safe house at one end and the escape on the other. Likewise, every character and zombie theme is randomly generated by combining 3 cards giving each player, and team, its own strengths and weaknesses.<br/><br/>The humans must move through the town to the escape, collecting items, rescuing nameless survivors (extras), fighting zombies, and hiding at strategic moments. Zombies killed by the characters are taken as points, and are spent to activate abilities and buy powerful plot changing cards (H-cards). The zombies in turn spawn and direct the undead, collect hunger (zombies&rsquo; resource) and use their cards and abilities to overwhelm the humans before they escape. Unlike the humans, the zombies&rsquo; plot cards (Z-cards) are drawn freely over time as well as purchased, meaning the clock is against the living. Gameplay is dynamic as both teams are affected by random events and changes in their opponents&rsquo; strategy.<br/><br/>PostHumousZ 295 unique cards add near endless variation, depth, drama and humor to each game, while simple base rules and bold art make it quick to learn, easy to keep track of, and low on downtime.<br/><br/>"}, "97051": {"videogame": {"95926": "Atari Anthology"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Casino", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"95268": "Atari 2600 (1986 Picture Cartridge) Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic971810.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2404": "Card / Casino Games"}, "usersrated": "3", "average": "6", "videogamegenre": {"2402": "Classic Games"}, "videogameplatform": {"6063": "Android"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"95926": "Atari Anthology"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic971810_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>The game displayed in a top-down fashion.

Before the darkness arrived no one had heard of it, instead magic was gifted by gods to their followers. However shortly after the arrival of the darkness the gods seemed to turn their backs on their followers and their powers dwindled to nothing. Once the majority of the priestly magic had left the world the soul magic appeared from an unknown source.<br/><br/>Practitioners of this magic believe that their souls are directly linked to the world and through the world they are linked to the lives of everything and everyone. They believe that by drawing on the soul, they are drawing power in essence from the world and life itself in order to cast their spells. Soul magic, when compared to mage magic, is more limited as mages get more spells and are individually more powerful. However the benefit of soul magic is that two or more low level soul casters can &quot;join&quot; in casting a spell to gain a high-powered effect.<br/><br/>There are three types of Soul Casters:<br/><br/>Light Soul Magic<br/>Light Soul Magic revolves around life and purity. Light soul casters cannot join with dark soul casters when trying to cast a spell to greater effect; they may only join with other light casters.<br/><br/>Dark Soul Magic<br/>Dark Soul Magic revolves around corruption and death. Dark soul casters cannot join with light soul casters when trying to cast a spell to greater effect. They may only join with other dark casters.<br/><br/>Grey Soul Casters<br/>Grey Soul Casters walk a fine line between life and death. They have a very balanced outlook on everything that they do, never favouring one or the other. You cannot become a grey caster; instead you must choose to be one when you create your character.<br/><br/>Unlike mages, the soul casters do not have to learn spells. Instead, when they reach a certain level of power, they gain all the standard powers that go with that level. There are rumours of additional powers that they may learn at higher levels but it is still a new type of magic and few, if any, have achieved a high level of mastery in it. The benefit of soul magic over mage magic is that soul casters can &quot;join&quot; when casting a spell. For example, if two second level casters joined to cast a spell they could duplicate the effect of a fourth level power that neither could cast alone.<br/><br/>"}, "97079": {"rpgitemversion": {"95312": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Psionic Powers", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "rpg": {"10199": "Faded Glory LRP"}, "usersrated": "0", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "average": "0", "description": "From the Introduction:<br/><br/>There are two types of psion in the world, wild psions and true psions.<br/><br/>True psions<br/>It costs 6 points to become a true psion, this gets you three level 1 psionic abilities and 6 power points with which to power these abilities.<br/><br/>When you create your psion you must choose one specialist school which you are very good at using and one trouble school you have great difficulty using.

We have more thoroughly developed the Victorian England setting. Character creation has been reworked, with some new wrinkles added, and there are new articles on the Victorian world, crime, politics, personalities, and so forth. There are also extensive new sections on the Cthulhu Mythos in Britain -- creatures, cults, books, etc. -- including a pr&eacute;cis of Ramsey Campbell&rsquo;s Severn River Valley. Also included are tips on running various types of Gaslight era campaigns, a gazetteer of intriguing British myths and legends, a selection of friends and foes from Victorian fiction, and a lengthy new bibliography/filmography of suggested reading and viewing.

FastScore Football allows the Replayer to quickly play out a whole day's schedule of games, including realistic scores, in just minutes!<br/><br/>It's a quick play game that generates the score of a football game with a few rolls of the dice. It incorporates ease of play, a simple ratings system and simple charts. Hundreds of simulated seasons are run, ensuring the accuracy of each Fastscore season while factoring in each team&rsquo;s strength of schedule.<br/><br/>Although the ratings seem simple, there is a great deal of background information packed into each rating. This game uniquely takes into account the offensive and defensive styles of each team by separating scoring frequency and scoring ability. For example, some teams may score frequently, but fail to execute in the red zone- thus adding points to the board with field goals more frequently than touchdowns. Others may rarely score but efficiently march into the endzone- thus scoring more touchdowns than field goals.   Additionally, offensive and defensive strengths in the running and passing game are reflected in the ratings and will influence the score of the game.  For example, teams with strong defenses against the run will more effectively shut down teams that rely on the running game.  And in close games, give your team a fighting chance by going for a 2-pt conversion!<br/><br/>With Fastscore football, teams will perform similarly to their real-life stats in points for and against, touchdowns for and against, field goals for and against, and most importantly, their win-loss record.  These stats are fine-tuned to a 250-season average typically within 10 points of actual, and within 2 TDs and FGs of actual.  Strength of schedule is factored into the ratings to ensure the utmost in accuracy.<br/><br/>And the best part: we&rsquo;ve included the as-played schedule for each season! And we didn&rsquo;t stop there- we know that your time is valuable, so we&rsquo;ve calculated the final team ratings for each game on the schedule- taking into account home field advantage and the run/pass ratings- so you don&rsquo;t have to do the calculations yourself.  Just sit back, roll the dice and mark down the score of the game.<br/><br/>Fastscore Football is played using two differently colored 6-sided dice. Each team has seven ratings representing offensive and defensive abilities and a clutch rating. Better ratings are color coded in green while worse ratings are color coded in red. Higher offense ratings represent teams with punishing offenses. Lower defense ratings represent teams that effectively shut down their opponents.<br/><br/>If you play Fastscore as a stand-alone game, you can finish a season replay in a few hours! You can also use Fastscore Football as a complement to detailed, play by play games like Second Season Football.

As the attack develops the Germans must generate fast movement through this area and break free into the tactical second echelon quickly to keep from getting bogged down.&nbsp; The Soviets must use terrain and their considerable obstacles to slow down and stop the Germans in their tracks.&nbsp; Stopping the Germans is going to be very hard. &nbsp; The Germans will find their force attrited slowly but surely over time and the Red Army will be slaughtered in the first few days and then settle down to the grind that was the battle.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"95371": "First edition"}, "average": "7.28182", "name": "Death Ride Kursk: 11th Panzer", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "15", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "11", "boardgamefamily": {"24965": "Death Ride"}}, "97115": {"poll": {}, "name": "All About Albany", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1981", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"24283": "All About Town"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic975436_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2335": {"name": "All About Town, Inc."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic975436.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"95372": "All About Town edition 1981"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "The object of this game is for the players, using dice and playing pieces, to travel on the gameboard from a Residence Square to the shopping locations shown on their shopping lists.

Life on Earth in 2054 is tough for many. Climate change and natural disasters have not only torn many from their usual way of life, but have also prompted conflict over scarce resources such as water in some areas. Meanwhile, technology brings more and more comfort to the privileged. Political and civil unrest, as well as outright war in some areas, has seen the geo-political landscape change. The empires of the late 20th and early 21st centuries are falling as new countries take advantage of the upheaval to assert their dominance. Amongst this turmoil, corporations have seized the initiative. In many areas, where governments don&rsquo;t have the resources or stability to protect, treat or feed their citizens, corporations are the sole providers of law and infrastructure. America may have been the first country to send a man to the Moon, but it was a corporation that sent the first man to Mars.<br/><br/>Genesis Descent has three levels of play: Street, Company and Agent.

The term &quot;Lords of Baseball&quot; refers to the moguls on the business end of the game.  The people who make the decisions and cut the paychecks have been made into symbols of greed and of ferocity.  In Lords of Baseball, you will take on the role of one of these owners.  You will need to build an entire organization, not just a Major League team.<br/><br/>Baseball Hall-of-Famer Tommy Lasorda once said of the game, &quot;No matter how good you are, you're going to lose one-third of your games.  No matter how bad you are you're going to win one-third of your games.  It's the other third that makes the difference.&quot;<br/><br/>In Lords of Baseball, your record is based on this principle.  Do you have what it takes to sustain a dynasty?  Will you build your team through trades or through a strong farm system?  With multiple paths to victory, Lords of Baseball will give you that chance.  It&rsquo;s not only about winning the World Series, it&rsquo;s also about doing the little things that will help you score Victory Points and at the end of 20 years make you the Lord of Baseball.<br/><br/>Lords of Baseball is a card driven game where players take control of a fictional organization and build it from the ground up.  They will invest money into a Farm System, Front Office, and Field Manager in an attempt to build a dynasty.  Over the course of 5 seasons, owners will use these investments to score Victory Points.  These investments will not only score VP's for owners, but also give them certain privileges during game play.<br/><br/>Each year is broken down into 4 phases: The Off season, The Early Season, Middle Season, and Late Season.  During each off season, owners will be required to pay player's and Manager's salaries, invest in the Farm System and Front Office, as well as make player personnel decisions.  These player decisions will go a long way towards seeing how well the team fares during the season.  During the season, owners will play card events or card OPS to decide their team records for each phase.  The cards are built similarly to many other CDG's in that cards have two event options on them.  Cards have one event that can be played during the off-season and one that can be played during the season.  These cards also have OP values that work in conjunction with players on the team to generate wins.<br/><br/>If the team with the best record has enough wins to win the pennant, that team moves on to a World Series phase that allows them to earn more VP.<br/><br/>The game lasts a predetermined number of seasons and the owner with the most VP at the end of the fifth season is declared the Lord of Baseball.<br/><br/>Components List<br/><br/>Rulebook<br/>4 Chart books<br/>1 Main Board<br/>4 Player Team Mats<br/>144 Player Cards<br/>20 Offseason Cards<br/>48 Cubes (12 in each color)<br/>4 VP Pawns<br/>2 Ten-Sided Dice<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"95458": "English First Edition"}, "age": "10", "name": "Lords of Baseball", "playingtime": "150", "boardgamemechanic": {"2018": "Campaign / Battle Card Driven"}, "average": "6.4", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": {"5586": "Sports: Baseball"}}, "97157": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Run For It", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"95463": "Atari 8-bit version"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "videogameplatform": {"4940": "Atari 8-bit family"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Manuever and bounce your little roller-skating guy across multiple screens of platforms, blasting the little bugs and mushrooms that stand in your way.

They marched all the way to  Abomey, the capital of the land, and found the rulers gone. They  amused themselves by looting the city for souvenirs. The French press  was most impressed by a white parasol decorated with human jawbones.<br/><br/>They never saw the inside of that parasol. Inside it was a map drawn  in human blood, a map that pointed to a legendary city deep in Afrca's interior. This city was called the City of Brass, a bastion of ancient  African civilization full of treasure, both gold and knowledge.<br/><br/>Sadi Carnot, the president of France, sent a expedition on that  doomed journey. It only took three weeks for them to become hopelessly lost in an uncharted land. To this day, no one knows what happened to them. According to legend, only one of them made it, and his  greatest wishes were given unto him.<br/><br/>In this game, you will play those lost souls.

The nobility found  among the people of Africa is not balanced against the savagery found  here. Like all peoples, the historic Africans had both high nobility and  awful destruction found in them. Even though this game depicts the  negative side of culture disproportionally, the author is fully aware  that is not the only side, or even the dominant side.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/>This game is a form of highly abstracted, limited scope role-playing game with a fixed set of characters and goals.<br/><br/>Each player takes one of 6 different pre-defined characters: the Explorer, the Official, the Doctor, the Priest, the Naturalist, and the Native Guide.  A minimum of 4 players is recommended and one player must play the Explorer.  The Explorer nominates the Leader and the Leader selects a Companion.  The Leader narrates the obstacles that face the expedition.<br/><br/>Each player must name their character (a French sounding name is recommended) and answer the question: what does your character seek in the City of Brass.<br/><br/>Each character has 6 predefined statistics and each Ability has a corresponding Resource that replenishes it . The Resources are drawn from a deck of resource cards during play.<br/><br/>The game is divided in 5 Acts, in each of the first four Acts there are 5 Obstacles.  The fifth act is the City of Brass and final scoring is done at the end of this act.<br/><br/>Points are scored by defeating the obstacles and players may help one another during play, but are free to refuse help.  Obstacles are defeated by rolling a pool of dice against the target set by the Leader for that obstacle.  The number of dice rolled is determined by the Ability that is required to defeat it.<br/><br/>Each player totals their Quest Points earned during play and plays out the endgame story.  The endgame has a blind voting/bluff mechanism that offers a point bonus based on player voting, bluffing is possible during the vote count.<br/><br/>At the end of play, the player with the most points is the winner.  Ties are possible.<br/><br/>"}, "97188": {"videogame": {"101339": "Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "APB", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"167753": "English/European Amstrad CPC Cassette edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1552484.png", "videogametheme": {"2280": "Crime"}, "usersrated": "2", "average": "7", "videogamegenre": {"2314": "Arcade"}, "videogameplatform": {"4415": "Amiga"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"167735": "Midway Arcade Origins"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1552484_t.png", "description": "A.P.B.

The game was released for the Apple II, DOS, as a PC Booter, TRS-80, VIC-20, and Atari 8-bit. .<br/><br/>Players take on the role of adventurer Sudden Smith. Smith must try to rescue captives from the interior of an asteroid orbiting the star Rigel. Players have 60 minutes to rescue 10 human captives from the alien moon base. They must first find the captives before delivering them to the rescue ship (via a transport beam). Players must defeat or avoid the enemies wandering the base: the alien Tollahs, two types of armed robots, a six-legged &quot;cerbanth&quot;, and a huge amoebic slug. As players forge deeper into the alien stronghold, they have the opportunity to acquire better weapons.<br/><br/>The playfield is presented as a top-down view of the room in which the hero is located. The game is turn-based, with the player given a certain number of &quot;points&quot; to spend on various actions, completing their turn when the points ran out. Rescue at Rigel shares many similarities with its inspiration, Temple of Apshai, a popular dungeon crawl by Epyx and part of their &quot;Dunjonquest&quot; series.<br/><br/>Rescue at Rigel used the concept of providing room descriptions similar to those used in some Dunjonquest games, but instead of having numerous unique descriptions assigne to numbered rooms, the game had multiple rooms labeled &quot;Sanctum&quot;, for example, and a detailed description of what typical Sanctums contained was provided in the manual. There are twelve different room types described in the manual.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Rescue at Rigel&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>Back of Box<br/><br/>The trouble started when a renegade High Tollah sought sanctuary in the Stellar Union. To get back at the renegade, this uncaring adversary ordered 10 men and women from the Orion colony of Ultima Thule taken prisoner. There, inside a secret base on a moonlet circling Rigel, Tollah scientists used these victims to find a means of reducing the human race to the status of Common Tollah. In the Tollah scheme of things, there was room in the cosmos for only one set of decision-makers: the High Tollah.<br/><br/>Although the Tollah race walks erect, their faceted eyes, mandibular jaws and long abdomens are clearly insectoid. Will the 10 prisoners be transformed into these aliens, or will they be saved miraculously by your role-playing alter ego: Sudden Smith?<br/><br/>With &quot;Rescue at Rigel,&quot; you can have the excitement of our fantasy role-playing system in the science-fiction universe of &quot;Starfleet Orion&quot; and &quot;Invasion Orion.&quot; You take the part of the brave Smitty, and it's all up to you. You must find your way through a maze of corridors, chambers, gravshafts and teleportals...trying to save the 10 humans held somewhere within. Their insectoid captors move them from room to room inside the complex, so each time you play, you must search again!<br/><br/>Armed with powergun and blaster, you must battle the aliens that lurk there, and then, somehow get yourself out of the moonbase alive! Your powergun and shield draw energy from your powerpack. Your blaster has only a handful of charges, and your rescue ship is under orders to leave--with or without you--in 60 minutes!<br/><br/>Can you rescue the 10 prisoners before your powerpack is depleted? Can you get back to your rendezvous point in time? Can you escape the dreaded clutches of the unmerciful High Tollah? Try it, Smitty. You're their only hope.<br/><br/>"}, "97215": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Plan 9 From Outer Space", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"95580": "US DOS"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic971406.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2355": "Detective / Mystery"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "10", "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic971406_t.jpg", "description": "Plan 9 from Outer Space is a point and click adventure game developed by Konami for the Amiga. It was released in 1992 and published by Gremlin Graphics.<br/><br/>Background<br/><br/>The game is inspired by the 1959 Z-movie Plan 9 from Outer Space. It featured footage of famous actor Bela Lugosi interspersed with Tom Mason. Director Ed Wood had taken a few minutes of silent footage of Lugosi, in his Dracula cape, for a planned vampire picture but was unable to find financing for the project. When he later conceived of &quot;Plan 9&quot;, he wrote the script to incorporate the Lugosi footage and hired his wife's chiropractor to double for Lugosi in additional shots. The double hid his face with his cape to hide the fact that he was not Bela Lugosi.<br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>The game starts when the producer notices that the film has been stolen by Bela Lugosi's double. The player must carry out a Epic search of the locations where Plan 9 from Outer Space was filmed to find the six missing reels.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>Back of Box<br/><br/>Plan 9 Stolen From Studio Archives!<br/><br/>Plan 9. The critics hated it. Bela Lugosi died during it. And his double has stolen it.<br/><br/>Lugosi's replacement is still bitter after 33 years from critics' reviews dubbing his only movie &quot;The Worst Film of All-Time.&quot; Even though he remained faceless, he intends to bring glory to the cult classic using more footage of himself and...colorizing it. As the studio's Private Eye you'll search over 70 locations, find the 6 reels and screen the film, frame-by-frame, to ensure that the warped actor did not cut Bela from the flick. Using actual digitized film footage, you'll sweat each scene, examining Plan 9 with slow motion, freeze frame, fast forward and rewind.

The clock is turned back from a generally Renaissance-like setting to the rougher and bloodier Dark Ages, when honor was more common than steel and history mingled interchangeably with myth. Forget empires and grand feudal states: The landscape is dotted with small settlements and petty kingdoms, surrounded by a wilderness that&rsquo;s largely unexplored and rife with natural and supernatural dangers. Kings, cities, knights, and armies do not exist as we think of them, replaced instead by log-walled mead halls and common-born heroes rising up to become savage reavers, fearsome monster-slayers, and overproud lords. Truly nowhere nurtures -- and needs --player characters more than here.<br/><br/>Adventuring in the frozen North isn&rsquo;t just about playing the Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game with snow and more barbarian NPCs,<br/>quaffing mead from drinking horns (although that&rsquo;s certainly part of it), and horned helmets (which certainly aren&rsquo;t). This is a land created from the history and legends of the Norse peoples, and there are strong themes from both that can enrich your gaming experience. In this chapter, we&rsquo;ll look at the major motifs and touchstones for campaigns that embrace them. So sharpen your axe and raise the dragon&rsquo;s head upon the longship&rsquo;s prow, we&rsquo;re heading north.<br/><br/>The time has come to brave the frozen empires of the savage north.

Since I'm the person writing it its been written from the IC point of view of one of my own characters. The idea for the book is relatively old and dates back to the early days of State of the Empire when Watching-Owl achieved the post of Spiratus of the General Inquisition. The Department of Spiratus, at that time being one of the then nine departments that made up the Inquisition. Specifically the department responsible for monitoring the activities of the various Churches and Faiths within the Empire and supernatural threats to the Empire that were of a Spiritual nature. Not an easy task.<br/><br/>As part of those responsibilities Watching-Owl decided to create a Grand Register to document the faiths active within the Empire. Plans were put in motion and laws enacted to allow him to collate the information. This worked reasonably well, suffice it to say these original files were carefully gathered, collated and hoarded on a now extinct PC. Still with a copy of just about every Companion and Guild Directory since the start of the McManus Era I've been able to recover most of this information. Additionally I put out further requests for information. So all those faiths that sent in information have been listed.<br/><br/>There is of course the problem of secretive faiths. Those whose true beliefs and tenets are unknown outside their organisation. So as to fairly represent this there are sections added to these faiths that are made up of knowledge that only those initiated into the Church would have access to but they are listed here for a matter of out of character completeness.<br/><br/>I'd like to add my disclaimers now. Many of the faiths, especially the older ones, may be interpreted in many different ways. What is here is a write up of the generalised basis for the faith. Some such as St Michael and Elbereth for a long time had very little to obviously distinguish them. They even share the same miracle list.<br/><br/>Of course since their inception they have grown and changed. The effect of State of the Empire and Heroes of the Empire on helping to cement the idea of a pantheon with Deities responsible for specific aspects of the world has allowed further definition of these Churches but they are still quite extreme views within the Church and not all those views have been addressed but rather those that were presented to me when I asked for information regarding them. Or to put it another way I could only really write up what I was sent, so some Churches have long write ups but that's because large chunks of information were submitted, so if you feel that your Church is under represented take issue with your guild leaders .<br/><br/>Newer faiths tend to revolve around a more precise and singular concept. The &quot;Words From Above&quot; rule book for Priests has also greatly helped in furthering this as newer churches have greater options for their basic miracle list allowing them to both be more varied from the older faiths and more structured in their choice of miracles from the start.<br/><br/>The concept of divinity was greatly expanded on in Heroes with the idea of different types of deities and levels of god-hood. Until the generation or uncovering, of the Primal Deities, depending on your viewpoint, gods were pretty much modelled on a very Monotheistic system. That is despite there being many deities they were unconnected and each existed as high up Omnipotent, Omniscient and Omnipresent beings in their own Heavens.<br/><br/>The events of the Namer War helped give the major gods, i.e. those who had a large number of PC priests and who were mainly goodly, a more coherent set of identities and form a pantheon. Naturally, as is usually the case with change, not everyone shared this view point but in the end it seemed to be generally well received and is now part of the ever expanding history of Primus and beyond.<br/><br/>Ian &quot;BBB&quot; Armstrong<br/><br/>"}, "97241": {"rpgitemversion": {"95631": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Tunnel Quest 3.5", "rpgproducer": {"17227": "Mike Hill"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic971632.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpg": {"6189": "TunnelQuest 3"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic971632_t.jpg", "description": "website blurb:<br/>This is a home-brew game that&rsquo;s seen about 3 years worth of play-testing (on and off). It&rsquo;s a generic &lsquo;vanilla&rsquo; fantasy game; I know there are a lot of these around but please bear with me.<br/><br/>The design is loosely based on a game by Paul Elliott (Mithras in the RPG.net forums) called Dragons (and used with his permission).<br/><br/>Broadly speaking, it&rsquo;s class based in that your starting point in the game is defined by the character&rsquo;s class and certain tasks are easier or more appropriate for certain classes but it isn&rsquo;t a black and white distinction, your warrior character can cast spells if you insist but that will &lsquo;dilute&rsquo; his ability to kick butt in combat.<br/><br/>The game uses a standard 2-dice &lsquo;roll-equal-or-over&rsquo; mechanic but keeps the modifiers to a minimum so there are very few numbers to juggle.<br/><br/>The system is &lsquo;pass or fail&rsquo; with a slight difference in that if the PC&rsquo;s roll fails, the opponent necessarily succeeds. So one dice roll determines the outcome of each combat round.<br/><br/>The upshot of this is that the referee never has to roll any dice. The game plays out on the strength of the players&rsquo; rolls. Not only does this give the ref. time to focus his or her attention elsewhere but makes the game quite convenient for play-by-board outings.<br/><br/>The magic system is quite strategic with magic-users having access to &lsquo;magic points&rsquo; of differing colours. A spell can be countered if you can match it point-for-point and colour-for-colour so throwing an extra point into your spell makes it more difficult to counter.<br/><br/>Creatures are defined with a single attribute (like the Tunnels &amp; Trolls Monster Rating) but special abilities are activated on specific dice roll results to keep the players guessing.<br/><br/>A sample dungeon adventure is included and if you haven&rsquo;t guessed already the game is a tribute to old-school games in general and T&amp;T in particular.<br/><br/>User comment:<br/>This game is available as a free download from 1km1kt.<br/><br/>"}, "97242": {"poll": {}, "name": "Dodgem", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1950", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1348537_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3320": {"name": "(Unknown)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1348537.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"95632": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "There is no date on the rules but the style of the graphics and shape of the vehicles suggest post 1945 and likely to be in the early 1950's.<br/><br/>The mechanics of the game is similar in style to ludo/pachisi but involves moving both a pedestrian and a vehicle from Home to Base to win.

Each round all players get 7 new letter cards. A die is rolled to determine the length of the word that will score points in that round. (Ex. If a 4 is rolled, only 4-letter words score points that round.) Roll a bull&rsquo;s-eye, and the roller gets to determine that round&rsquo;s word length.<br/><br/>Each letter card has a value attached to it. Some special letter cards have a range of values (Ex. 0 - 2) where a player gets to choose the value (0, 1 or 2) if that card can be used in a word. Playing at the same time, using their own cards, players have one minute to make a word of the determined length for that round.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, players advance their tokens by the number of points in the word they made, starting with the player who rolled the die. Choose carefully. Your highest-scoring word isn&rsquo;t always your best choice. There are consequence targets on the board (red - always beneficial; black - take a chance) that can help you get to the final goal fastest.  Land on a target - take the consequence.

The city's wealth depends on fishing and the trading of salted fish. Salt produced in the mines has to be loaded onto ships and used to preserve herring and cod fished in the Atlantic Ocean. Every week ships full of salt barrels leave Rouen for the fishing grounds of the Atlantic Ocean, and once back, the goods are sold in the city markets. The players represent city merchants, and they invest in ships and city buildings to try to get rich. Who will be the richest merchant of Rouen, when Francis I, King of France, comes to visit the City?<br/><br/>In Upon a Salty Ocean, players start the game with one caravel loaded with three salt barrels, a salt mine and 10-16 money. From this, they must build a shipping empire! The game lasts five turns, with each turn being divided into three phases.<br/><br/>In the event phase, players adjust prices on the market based on the current event tile, take into the account the weather and environmental conditions that will affect them the remainder of the round, and reveal the event tile for the subsequent round.<br/><br/>The action phase lasts a variable number of rounds depending on how many actions players want to take and can afford. Eight actions are available and they're divided into four types:<br/><br/><br/>    City: (1) buy a saline and (2) buy a building<br/>    Navigation: (1) travel to the ocean and fish and (2) travel to Rouen<br/>    Harbor: (1) build a ship and (2) move goods<br/>    Market: (1) sell to the market and (2) buy from the market<br/><br/><br/>On a player's turn, he can take any one of the either actions or pass; the cost of an action is the number of times this type of action has been performed previously during this round. For example, the first use of a City action costs 0, while the next use (whether to buy a saline or a building) costs 1. A player who passes can take an action later in the same phase. The action phase ends once all players pass. A player can go into debt during a turn, paying one coin in interest when doing so; as long as the player is in the black once the action round ends (by selling to the market), no further payment is due.<br/><br/>In the turn end phase, players produce salt, may use special buildings, pay interest (if needed), reset the cost of the actions to zero, and so on. A player can have no more than 40 coins at the end of a turn unless he owns a banque, and the limit is 80 coins without owning Salle des Coffres. This limit is important as the player with the most coins after five rounds wins. Some buildings provide endgame bonuses to which the coin limit doesn't apply.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"100778": "Dutch first edition"}, "average": "6.5496", "name": "Upon a Salty Ocean", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "age": "13", "usersrated": "607", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"11006": "Country: France"}}, "97274": {"rpgitemversion": {"95676": "The Stone Man's Puzzle"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Stone Man's Puzzle", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic991901.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"240": "Greyhawk"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"221": "Dungeons & Dragons (3rd Edition)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"1981": "COR - Living Greyhawk Core Adventures"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic991901_t.jpg", "description": "Adventure description from front page &quot;The town of Hardby was in complete disarray when you arrived.

The player must fight against the navy and air forces of various other nations including Argentina, the Soviet Union, and Iran.<br/><br/>Situations posed by the scenarios include:<br/><br/>As the Captain of a U.S. frigate, your ship is stationed in the Persian Gulf as part of a routine patrol.

It simulates combat actions between wolf packs of German U-boats and convoys of Allied destroyers and merchant vessels in the Battle of the Atlantic.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The player can choose to command either side, the wolfpack or the convoy, with the computer controlling the enemy vessels. At any time the player may take command of any vessel in his group, including of the tankers and freighters which each carry a single gun. Each vessel can be set to remain on course or at rest, or to act under computer control while the player controls another vessel. This feature helped pave the way for many modern day real-time strategy video games.<br/><br/>The game allows the player to choose between different levels of tactical complexity. The player can simply command one submarine, or one at a time, or issue orders and command the operations of the entire group. He can order a vessel to patrol a certain path, laid out using the mouse with the map screen, or to anchor at a certain point, or take other actions. The user can also create new missions, choosing initial locations, orders, and patrol routes for vessels on both sides.<br/><br/>The player can choose to run the simulation in real-time, or increase the speed by up to 32 times, allowing the ships to cross large distances in a reasonable time. The simulation automatically slows to real-time at important times such as when shots are fired.<br/><br/>Technology<br/><br/>The game reflects a number of advances in technology that occurred during the course of World War II. Each mission takes place during a particular year of the war. In later years new submarine classes are available to the player, with advances such as greater underwater speed. Destroyers gain radar and active sonar for detection of submarines, and hedgehog antisubmarine weapons, to supplement the depth charges, guns and passive sonar of the earlier destroyers.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Wolfpack (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>Back of Box<br/><br/>Naval strategists now able to fight both sides of World War II<br/><br/>WolfPack is as real as history's headlines.

This is a closed world similar in ways, yet unlike our own; a world of decaying Imperial grandeur, strange magics, mysterious spirits and Machiavellian politics. The players take the roles of the subjects of the Realms, the autonomous regions of the Imperium, and their leaders, at any political level from the simplest of farmers, up through the merchants and soldiers of the Realm, to the very court of the Realm Lords who sit in Imperial Synod. Groups of players come together to play characters from one of the established Realms or in conjunction with the referees, design their own Imperial Realm and it's economy, type and style of rulership, and portray it as they see fit.<br/><br/>The primary thrust of the game is political; manoeuvring between Realms, up to and including open armed conflict, is common, and the system includes both a complex system for trading in downtime, an established economy (with some very unpleasant moneylenders) and a system of political advancement limited only by the skill of the player in climbing the greasy pole. No part in this system is debarred to players; it is conceivable that a player character could one day become the new occupant of the Malachite Throne and rule the entire Archipelago.<br/><br/>However, the politics are not all that make the world of the Archipelago go round. There are areas of the Archipelago still wild and uncontrolled by the Imperium; a daring adventurer with a large enough force or enough skill could even carve out a new realm from such, gaining themselves a seat on Synod and status as a Realm Lord, or indeed a faith could gain enough influence in a given realm that it's leader could supplant the Realm Lord; there are several theocratic Realms, and several where status as a sorcerer of one stripe or another is regarded as the qualification for political power. For those for whom political ambition is not alluring, there are mysteries of magic and existence, questions of philosophy to ponder and new places to explore. The glory days of the Imperium are gone but not forgotten and new glories are waiting to be created. Much of the oldest and subtlest arts have been lost to time and neglect, but could be rediscovered by the dedicated.<br/><br/>For those to whom the mundane is no longer interesting, there is the allure of testing your wits against the cold uncaring stars for the Astrologers, against the cunning and subtle spirits of the Spirit Families for the Rhabdomancers, and of placing your thumb on the very balance of life and death for the Natural Philosophers. Magic is a fact of life among the islands and scattered Realms of the Imperial Archipelago, and many such ply their trades; from the village astrologer who establishes the times and places to seed the crops for a rural village to the court Rhabdomancer summoning his familiars to bargain for charms and favours for his Realm Lord. Magic exists at every level of life. Or if meddling with the Subtil Arts is not to your taste, explore the myriad cults and faiths of the Imperium; some powerful, some proscribed, some influential, some remembered only by lone hermits deep in the mountains. Men of faith can work miracles; to deny it is, surely to invite the wrath of Those Above And Below...<br/><br/>If it is a life of adventure and drama that you seek but neither the Subtil Arts nor the political games of Court appeal, then become an Imperial Herald; the messengers of the Imperium, they travel from realm to realm promulgating Imperial Edicts, protected by Imperial law and enforced by the Imperial Sea Guard. Heralds bring news from realm to realm, and are often in the forefront of exploration and mapping efforts; they stand separate from all allegiance to the Realm Lords, answering only to the Master Herald, who answers only to the Emperor.<br/><br/>Or if meddling with markets is more to your taste then play a Merchant, there are many interesting commodities produced within the Empire and the demand for them fluctuates. If you are clever enough you can gain favour, wealth and influence through shrewd trading. Pit your wits against other merchants and rise to power within the secretive and cut-throat Merchants Houses.<br/><br/>It is our intent to run the game as an ongoing campaign, with opportunities for character advancement through experience and the players' wits. We will run one, perhaps two if it becomes successful, events per year, and we do not envisage any &quot;sanctioned event&quot; system. In terms of player involvement with the campaign, the referees must sanction all Realm and character backgrounds; silence is not assent and until a background is confirmed, it is not applicable. The referees reserve the right to fold, spindle and mutilate the backgrounds of the player-designed realms for the greater good of the campaign; however, it should be taken as a given that if any such changes are made they will be to make the campaign background a richer place and draw players in further, not to make your lives especially unpleasant. Well, that may not be strictly true...<br/><br/>Note also that the Imperial Archipelago is a closed world. There is almost no contact with anyone outside the cordon of the Sea Princes, and no character races other than those outlined are permitted.

Using the Boy Crazy cards (9 cards or more), first player secretly writes down which boy she likes best and why. Then the first player lays out the cards so everyone can see them. The other players try to make a match by writing who they think is the best boy for the first player and why. Then, each of the other players take turns revealing who they chose as her match. After the first player reveals her response, scores are tabulated for that round. Each player who correctly matches the first player's response scores a point. Play continues until every girl has a chance for her friends to guess her match. To start a new round players should discard starting set of 9 cards and draw a new set of 9 cards.

It is hard to spend an  hour creating a character knowing the great likelihood of their eventual fate, and even harder to justify  spending another hour on a new character after your previous one has just been rent limb-from-limb by a  shoggoth while on his first adventure. <br/> Hence, here is my proposed solution: use Risus as the gaming engine! It is hard to find a setting better suited  for 30 second character creation than the Cthulhu Mythos.

It's your only weapon in a world rife wtih monsters, necropunks, man-machine hybrids, gunslingers, and power-hungry politicos.  In Malifaux, you lead your crew in the battle for control of the Breach, a dark portal to a world of limitless magic.  Those who don't make it become monsters you must destroy.<br/><br/>Malifaux is a character-driven 32mm tabletop miniatures game.  Players lead groups, called Crews, in skirmish attacks against their opponents in the magical realm of Malifaux.  Players collect, build, and paint models representing the denizens of Malifaux and pit these Crews against one another.  Masters, powerful practitioners of magic, and those fighting them control these Crews.<br/><br/>Masters can manipulate the course of events in the world around them, and can change their own fates, through their control or theft of the powerful Soulstones in Malifaux.  A Crew conssists of a variety of fantastic and frightening beings, collectively known as Minions, who serve the Master as fodder in his or her machinations.  In addition, Henchmen can lead specialized Crews in their Master's absence, or serve their Master directly as a member of a Crew.  Masters and Henchmen are also supported by Totems, extension of their magical abilities which increase their spellcasting range and provide additional aid in an Encounter.<br/><br/>How well a Crew carries out its leader's Strategy and Schemes determiens whether or not it will emerge victgorious in an Encounter with an enemy Crew.  Strategies represent the Crew's main path to victory, while Schemes are simpler alternate routes to achieve the leader's goals.<br/><br/>Malifaxu players use decks of cards called Fate Decks to resolve game events such as attacking and spell casting.  Players can manipulate the cards they play to alter the Duel's outcome.

This is not a translation, far from it, but rather a french adaptation of a game that has never been published anywhere before in that language. The original rules are startlingly simple and vague to anyone familiar with the later versions. No truly canonical version exists, only a rereading often filtered down through the history of role-playing games, the memories of the oldest players, or their interpretations which are as numerous as they are judicious.<br/><br/>The 1974 rules were based on the tabletop miniatures wargame &quot;Chainmail&quot;, the historical source of all role-playing. I  returned to them several times in the course of design, to the point of renouncing the use of the 20-sided die, the famous d20, icon of gaming, in favour of 2d6, for which the system was originally designed. From the 2d6 design, in particular, came the special capabilities of the character classes and certain creatures, which differ from those of subsequent games in the same family.<br/><br/>"}, "97401": {"boardgamedesigner": {"48004": {"name": "Brian Scherzer"}}, "average": "6", "poll": {}, "name": "Advance the Colors", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "1990", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic974769_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"16720": {"name": "American Civil Wargaming Society"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic974769.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"95925": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1048": {"name": "American Civil War"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "User summary:<br/>Advance The Colors is the first widely-published set of 1:1 ratio rules to cover the American Civil War.

When the black mage's Royal Red Knights caught up with the adventureers, the Knights' commander Cerena disobeyed Kanon's order and came to the hidden nobles' aid.

The palce: Camineet on Palma, one of the three planets in the Algol Solar system located deep in the Andomeda galaxy. Under the democratic rule of King Lassic, life was good as he provided everything his people could want. Space Travel had been discovered 200 years beofre and deep space shuttles had allowed colonization of Motavia and Dezoris, the other worlds of the Algol Solar System.<br/><br/>But slowly, over time, things began to change. Dark priest of a new religion, never seen by any mortal, promised immortality to all who joined. You would live forever! King Lassic was getting old. The idea of living forever appealed to him so he became the first to join. Then, he... changed. The people began to suffer and horrible creatures and monsters began to stalk all three worlds. Lassic had become an evil tyrant.<br/><br/>But where there is evil there is always good. Lassic's Robotcops were ruthless, ferreting out the do-gooders that meant to unseat him. One of those do-gooders was Nero. Long ago, his father had disappeared trying to learn Lassic's evil secrets. And finally the Robotcops caught up with Nero as well. Before he died, he passed on his short sword and his quest to his sister, Alis. He also told her to find a brave fighter named Odin. Alis raised the sword to the sky and vowed that Nero's death would not be in vain!<br/><br/>PHANTASY STAR II<br/><br/>The Story<br/><br/>Somewhere drifting in space is the beautiful Algo Star System.

From far in her past comes the legend of Alis, the courageous young woman who fiercely found--and succeeded--in ridding Mota of the evil oppressor Lassic.<br/><br/>But now another tragedy oppresses Mota. This is one far worse than Lassic, being not a person, but an unknown evil! Everything is affected by it--the climate, the machinery, even nature! Strange vicious creatures infest the countrysides. They terrify and destroy! No longer does anyone venture outside a city--unless they don't want to return.<br/><br/>What happened to Mother Brain, the controlling entity of Mota? Why have things gone so wrong? Who is smart enough to solve the riddle? And who is brave enough to save the planet?<br/><br/>PHANTASY STAR III<br/><br/>The Story<br/><br/>Today's your big day.

When the players discover the Objective sector, they need to perform a specific task in it.<br/><br/>Visit us Facebook:<br/><a target='_blank' href='https://m.facebook.com/operationctk' rel='nofollow'>https://m.facebook.com/operationctk</a><br/>Website:<br/><a target='_blank' href='http://operation-c.wix.com/homepage' rel='nofollow'>http://operation-c.wix.com/homepage</a><br/><br/>"}, "97499": {"boardgamedesigner": {"48321": {"name": "Jeff Warrender"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Acts of the Disciples", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"16480": {"name": "Belltower Games"}}, "boardgameversion": {"96135": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1115": {"name": "Religious"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Players take on the role of Jesus&rsquo; Disciples, traveling with Jesus through Palestine and performing deeds consistent with His teachings.  But the actions the players will take will not always be received favorably by the three factions that will determine the fate of Judea &mdash; the Jews, who alternate between loving and resenting Jesus; Rome, which is not interested in Jesus but simply wants to impose civility and order, and the Pharisees, who abhor Jesus and who, as their anger increases, are looking for a member of Jesus&rsquo; inner circle to betray Him&hellip;<br/><br/>Each turn, players receive 4 actions, which they may spend traveling to one of the cities in Palestine, drawing action cards, spending action cards to perform a Deed in a city, or requesting Jesus to perform a Deed.  Deeds come in four categories (preach, heal, exorcise a demon, or show compassion), and the cost of performing a Deed increases with each Deed performed in that category.  But players can call on Jesus to perform a Deed, which resets that category's cost track and awards players present in the area with Gospel tokens.  Most of the Deeds also result in consequences on one or more of the political tracks, representing the crowds, the Pharisees, or Rome.<br/><br/>The game ends either when the Rome track reaches its end (indicating that Jesus and the Disciples have attracted too much attention and Rome decides to intervene), or when the player who was dealt the Judas card elects to end the game, and receives the payout indicated on the Pharisees track.<br/><br/>The players' score is comprised of victory points received from the Deeds they performed, the Gospel tokens they accumulated, and the conditions described on their secret Goal cards that they received at the start of the game.<br/><br/>"}, "97500": {"boardgamedesigner": {"64743": {"name": "Dr. Heinz Haber"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Trimino", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2002": "Tile Placement"}, "yearpublished": "1969", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": {"24450": "Triangular Dominoes"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1352967_t.jpg", "average": "6.66667", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"6660": {"name": "Creative Playthings"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1352967.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"96138": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Similar to Triominos but the numbers (pips) are on the sides of the triangular tiles rather than the corners.<br/><br/>45 tiles with a number from 1 to 4 on each side.<br/><br/>Game play is similar - play a tile on your turn but there are shape templates in the instruction booklet that have to be followed.
