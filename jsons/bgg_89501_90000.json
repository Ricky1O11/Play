Each direction has its own pros and cons, depending upon the opponent, weapons equipped, and level of the character's Ra-Seru. For example, equipping boots will increase the power of kicks, but 'Low' will not strike a Killer Bee, since it flies above the ground. To attack, the player creates a string of these directional strikes for each character; as the game progresses the length of this string or &quot;action bar&quot; increases, allowing the player to deal more damage each turn.<br/><br/>Certain strings of attacks initiate combos known as &quot;Arts,&quot; which deal significantly more damage than would a non-combo string of comparable length. It is up to the player to uncover each character's Arts by experimentation; fortunately, once the player has determined the correct string, it is saved in a list which can be viewed during the character's turn. A quantity called &quot;AP&quot; is necessary to initiate Arts, which drain &quot;AP&quot; in quantities which are proportionate to the length of the combo. Inputting an Arts sequence without the requisite AP will cause the character to simply perform the string of attacks, without the Arts animation or damage bonus. AP can be earned in three ways; dealing physical damage without performing Arts, taking damage from opponents, or by using the Spirit command. Arts can also be linked by the last and first inputs. For example, an Art that ends with 'Down' can linked with another Art that starts with 'Down', allowing the player to use two Arts in a row costing less inputs.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Legend of Legaia&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "89535": {"statistics": {}, "name": "MediEvil II", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"78304": "US PS1"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic915698.jpg", "videogameseries": {"6868": "MediEvil"}, "videogametheme": {"2509": "Comedy"}, "usersrated": "4", "average": "8.75", "videogamegenre": {"2161": "Action Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4433": "PlayStation"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic915698_t.jpg", "description": "MediEvil 2 (MediEvil II in North America) is the sequel to MediEvil, a Gothic comedy horror platform game that allowed the player to explore several horror themed levels set in the Medieval century, the opportunity to collect items, weapons and activate sequences in order to complete tasks to advance further in the story.

It is a light, fast-playing game of aerial dogfights between small numbers of jets. The objective of play is to defeat your opponent's air forces in close combat. The game is designed to be suitable for quick pickup games as well as long term campaigns.<br/><br/>As a print-and-play game, players are expected to print out and prepare the playing pieces with household craft tools (scissors, hobby knife, and ordinary glue). These playing pieces include jet fighters, movement and shooting tools, unique dice and (as an option) 3D paper models.<br/><br/>Game sessions begin by choosing a scenario. Each scenario establishes the starting positions and objectives of the fighter jets on each team. There are two sides in the war, the Rebels and the State. The scenarios are sometimes written to favor one side, to reflect the strengths and weaknesses of the opposing armies.<br/><br/>Once a scenario is selected, the players spend a certain number of &quot;army points&quot; to purchase their aircraft and outfit them with more experienced crews, weapons and special devices. Each jet uses its own record sheet, and during play the player controlling that jet is responsible for marking its current damage, ammo and other variables.<br/><br/>Gameplay proceeds by rounds, with each jet taking a turn according to its initiative score. Movement is handled using a fan-shaped &quot;movement key&quot; and rolling dice to determine the maximum turning angle for that instance. Attacks are handled with a &quot;range finder&quot; tool that is placed in front of the attacking jet and used to determine if any targets can be fired upon. Dice are rolled to determine the severity of damage.<br/><br/>Scenarios may be won by destroying the enemy team's jets, or by disabling or disarming the enemy team, forcing a forfeit. Some scenarios have special victory conditions, such as taking recon photos or bombing a ground target.<br/><br/>After a scenario, both sides are awarded some army points to further develop their air forces or replace ruined equipment. These changes may be carried over for use in the next scenario.<br/><br/>The base release for this game is the Air War Starter Set PDF. It contains all of the essential components, such as print-and-play dice, maneuvering and range-finding tools, speed tokens, smoke clouds, bombing targets and 2D jet fighter game pieces. This set includes two versions of the RG-6 Tigress, a fighter jet used by both sides during the war. The custom dice include a unique distribution of numbers, as well as keywords that are used in different situations.<br/><br/>The game is designed to be supplemented with individual vehicle packs containing new options and game pieces, as well as 3D paper model PDFs that can be assembled and used in place of the standard 2D jet fighter pieces. Expansions are planned that will introduce new jet types, heroic crew members, campaigns, ground vehicles and ships.<br/><br/>"}, "89549": {"poll": {}, "name": "The Lone Ranger: Frontier Town", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2011": "Modular Board"}, "yearpublished": "1948", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"20240": "Characters: The Lone Ranger"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic883556_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"17749": {"name": "Cheerios"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic883556.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"78331": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1055": {"name": "American West"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "&quot;Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear...&quot;<br/><br/>In 1948 the Lone Ranger radio program made the following announcement, &quot;In celebration of the 15th year of this program you can get your very own model of the Lone Ranger Frontier Town.

The Uskok Warlord Radoslav died during the last Venetian raid. All the Uskok leaders, including you, were invited to Nehaj, the unconquerable Uskok fortress, in order to choose their next Warlord.<br/><br/>Dark storm clouds loomed over the stone fortress, its walls battered by the bitter nothern gales, and yet the Uskok leaders could not come to an agreement. Mighty warriors though they were, none of them had proved to be enough to their comrades, so no Warlord had been chosen. As midnight struck, the debate was cut short by a shot from a flintlock. The hall went silent. The old sea dog Stipe spoke: &quot;According to ancient customs, if no agreement is reached by midnight, the title of Warlord shall go to the first lord who collects enough loot to fill twenty-five Uskok vessels.&quot; So it was written, and so it was done.<br/><br/>Uskoci were a historical pirate band in the 16th century who lived and prospered by being a nuisance for much more powerful opponents, but never on such a scale to provoke full-scale retaliation. Uskoci: The card game of Croatian pirates takes that idea of heart as players need to demonstrate both their skill as a pirate and restraint comparable to the historical Uskoci to prove the best captain among your peers.<br/><br/>In the basic game, players must combine treasures (valued 1-9) on their pile until they total exactly 25; what makes this difficult are the 14 event cards (Venetians, traitors, storms) that can mess with a player's plans or change the value of a treasure, but thankfully they can also protect you.

From aerial assaults to haunted bridges, From Here to There turns &quot;getting there&quot; into a lot more fun! Covering levels 2 to 13, this compilation has a place in every campaign.<br/><br/>This adventure compilation includes the following great adventures:<br/><br/>The Quick and the Dead (level 12), by Aeryn Rudel: While en route to their next adventure, the PCs pass through a thick copse of trees and are ambushed by a group of quickling muggers. The quicklings, however, do not attack to kill; instead, the little fey attempt to snatch a valuable item from each PC and and then race off into the forest!<br/><br/>When Madness Seeps Through (level 5), by Philippe-Antoine &ldquo;ChattyDM&rdquo; Menard: While traveling from a nearby town to their destination, the PCs spot a group of aberrant humanoids running across the road, each clutching struggling humans who call for help. Chasing the humanoids or following their trail deeper in the forest, the PCs find a forgotten temple occupied by the corrupted remnants of cultists.<br/><br/>The Deadly Blue Yonder (level 13), by Brandes Stoddard: A group of evil cultists discovered a nest of wyvern eggs, and when those eggs hatched the cultists trained the wyverns as mounts. They have used this remarkable advantage to establish a dominion over the local countryside. As the PCs pass through their territory, they must defend themselves against aerial attack!<br/><br/>The Toll Station (level 6), by Adrian Pommier: While passing through a toll station, the PCs are beset by nightmare creatures pulled from the imprisoned minds of the road wardens. To awaken the sleeping guardsmen and end the attacks, the PCs must smash a profane idol and defeat a demon of the Nightmare Goddess!<br/><br/>The Crossing (level 4), by Chris Dias: The PCs are traveling near a river or through mountainous terrain when they find themselves in a thick fog. As they venture further, they come to a bridge. With no sign of alternate routes, they must make their way across. The bridge is an illusion generated by a predatory monster called a chosis mimic &ndash; a psychic creature that feeds on the life spirit of those traveling near it. The illusionary bridge has no beginning and no end, and no matter how long the PCs travel, they never reach its end before they reach theirs &ndash; unless they destroy the chosis mimic!<br/><br/>The Hanging Tree (level 5), by Lee Hammock: The village of Tarrow has been using a local hanging tree to execute criminals for centuries, but now an innocent man has been added to its roster of the dead. The spirits of those previously killed on the tree have now risen up in a quest for vengeance, making travel through the area very difficult. After escaping from the undead raised by the hanging tree, the players reach Tarrow and discover why the spirits of the tree are restless by talking to the locals.<br/><br/>Flying High (level 2), by Colleen Simpson: The PCs are en route to their next adventure, traveling through a lightly wooded hilly area, when they are swooped upon by steelwing hippogriffs, which attempt to carry one or more PCs to their nest site. When the PCs arrive at the nest area, they observe kobolds attacking the steelwing hippogriff nests. The steelwing hippogriffs need the assistance of the heroes!<br/><br/>Mystery at the Wandering Wineskin Inn (level 5), by Ken McCutchen: The adventurers are resting comfortably at an inn. When the sun rises on a new day, the characters discover that one of the party members is missing! There are several items out of place in the room, and a search reveals several interesting clues. To locate the missing character, the party must gain knowledge about the missing companion, overcome misdirection from false allies, and defeat the brigands who are holding the missing character for ransom.<br/><br/>The Hunting Party (level 2), by Brandes Stoddard: In the wilds, the PCs encounter a large group of goblins. The normally aggressive creatures recognize that the PCs carry their weapons with experience and skill, and they are reluctant to engage a foe who could cost them many of their own hunters and foragers. They even go so far as to buy off the PCs with a side of boar meat or venison from a recent kill.<br/><br/>"}, "89573": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic987722.png", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"6747": {"name": "Marks & Spencer"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic987722_t.png", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "description": "From the box:<br/><br/>Get set for some brilliant teamwork as Wallace and Gromit embark on their latest career move!

Inventions are graded as hard (red / 3 points), medium (yellow / 2 points) or easy (green / 1 point).<br/><br/>On a modelling turn, the modeller makes as many as he can from that colour in one minute.

However, only the front character is actually able to physically attack the enemy. The other two characters serve in a supporting role, taunting the enemy and utilizing certain items or spells (the enemies have the same limitations.) If necessary, characters can be rotated out such that one of the support characters and the lead character exchange position<br/><br/>The key feature in this game which distinguishes it from most other RPGs is its built-in mini-dating simulation. Thousand Arms' dating sim features dating locations in many of its major cities and towns, and a cast of nine women. The dating aspect allows the player to pick dialogue choices.<br/>The dating aspect also has an actual in-game effect. By successfully wooing each female, her intimacy level can be slowly raised. As this level rises, it grants her the ability to imbue weapons with increasingly powerful spells and skills. This magical forging, which is possible due to Meis' training as a Spirit Blacksmith, relies on the smith having established such positive female relationships.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Thousand Arms&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "89645": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Trauma Center: Under the Knife 2", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"78482": "US DS edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic915788.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5406": "Trauma Center"}, "videogametheme": {"2465": "Medical"}, "usersrated": "3", "average": "8.16667", "videogamegenre": {"2156": "Simulation"}, "videogameplatform": {"4734": "Nintendo DS"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic915788_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>This DS-exclusive sequel to the original Trauma Center: Under the Knife continues the adventures of Derek Stiles and Angie as another GUILT outbreak occurs.<br/><br/>"}, "89646": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Valkyrie Profile: Covenant of the Plume", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"163931": "DS UK/EU Release"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic915791.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5400": "Valkyrie Profile"}, "videogametheme": {"2415": "Mythology"}, "usersrated": "12", "average": "7.26667", "videogamegenre": {"2414": "Tactical Role-Playing Game"}, "videogameplatform": {"4734": "Nintendo DS"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic915791_t.jpg", "description": "The third installment of the Valkyrie Profile series.

One day, Thyodor's friend Duwain arrives with news that Thyodor has fallen in battle, a Valkyrie's plume on his corpse indicating he was taken as an Einherjar, which Duwain gives to Wylfred. Thyodor's death leaves his family in poverty, Elsie dies of starvation, and Margot goes mad from grief. Wylfred becomes bitter and cynical, vowing vengeance on the reaper of his father's soul.<br/><br/>Years later, Wylfred leaves his mother and becomes a mercenary, hoping that he may also become an Einherjar and get his revenge on the Valkyrie. Ancel follows him, hoping to divert him from his quest. During a battle at Aullewyn Keep, Wylfred is mortally wounded and hears Queen Hel's voice, asking if he will do anything for revenge. Wylfred says yes and awakens to find the Valkyrie's feather in his hand, not fully understanding what he has done. Wylfred and Ancel are called upon to fight again and, outnumbered and outmatched, Wylfred invokes the Plume upon his friend. The incantation increases Ancel's strength and they defeat their opponents but Ancel dies afterward. Hel then delivers to Wylfred a woman named Ailyth, who is to accompany him and act as a contact between Wylfred and Hel.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Valkyrie Profile: Covenant of the Plume&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "89647": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Wario Ware Inc.

The game is played on a 12 x 12 grid representing a portion of the Atlantic Ocean. The object of the game for you is to sink as many British merchant ships and battleships as possible while bringing the Bismarck back to port. The object for the computer is to sink the Bismarck as quickly as possible or at least force it back to port before substantial  damage can be done to the British forces.&quot;<br/><br/>Summary<br/><br/>Using a simple text-based map, the player moves the Bismarck across the North Atlantic in search of convoys to attack while trying to avoid the main forces of the Royal Navy.  The game took into account the impact of weather changes and night time operations in a basic fashion, and combat was reported in simple lines of text.

This includes recruiting officers, improving agriculture and economy, drafting and training armies, maintaining diplomatic relations with other rulers and waging war. The ultimate goal of the game is to reunify China.<br/><br/>There are a few discerning features that depart from the past five editions:<br/><br/>i) Each general has a main goal/ambition in life. If assigned to tasks that are not in line with these goals, their loyalty will decrease.<br/><br/>ii) Each general possess a set of battle skills. Dueling now involves picking the correct skills to use during the 5 rounds of a duel. The War statistic still plays a crucial role in the duel, i.e. success and damage of the battle skills is related to it.<br/><br/>iii) There are different types of troops to recruit, depending on the location of the fortress.

It is a two-player tactical/operational simulation of the combat action on the American Sector during the first two days of the Normandy invasion, 6-7 June 1944.  The game looks at the American efforts all along the right flank of the Normandy landings. While Utah seemed relatively easy, it was there, at Omaha Beach, where the Germans came closest to derailing the greatest sea-borne invasion of all time. Behind both beaches, two famous airborne divisions were scattered all over the countryside, and fought by twos and twenties to accomplish a semblance of their missions. Call it the &ldquo;Longest Two Days,&rdquo; because that is the time-period covered in the game. Forty-eight hours of some of the most critical action in American history.<br/><br/>The key units are all here, including engineers with special abilities, DD-tanks,  parachute and glider landings, and even railroad coastal artillery. One defining feature of the game is unit deployment; a unit can be deployed in one of two modes: Movement Mode allows for the greatest movement but the weakest combat (which is not to say those units can&rsquo;t fight) and Combat Mode, which allows the strongest fighting abilities (but still some movement for most units).<br/><br/>&quot;Bradley&rsquo;s D-Day&quot; offers an intriguing scale, a moderate level of complexity, and an ease of play that will make this game either a fine addition to your Overlord collection, or a good first start for those who have not already focused on this campaign.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 2 hours of daylight or 4 hours or nightime<br/>Hex 800 meters<br/>Units: Company/Battalion<br/><br/>Game Equipment<br/>One 22&quot; x 34&quot; full color map<br/>Two counter sheets (320 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 20 page rule book<br/>One Terrain Effects Chart<br/>No dice (game owners need to supply two six-sided die)<br/><br/>"}, "89808": {"rpgitemversion": {"78787": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Invisibility", "rpgproducer": {"22527": "Bret Boyd"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic886835.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"524": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"3915": "Behind the Spells"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic886835_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The Behind the Spells pdf series continues with the invisibility spell!

These soldiers did the hard work, enduring attacks and sucking it up on the front lines while the cavalry and archery forces they protected reaped the lion&rsquo;s share of the glory.<br/><br/>Still, any commander worth his salt understood the value of these forces and knew that, when used effectively, a force comprised of archers, spearmen and cavalry was unbeatable.<br/><br/>First, as with all the books in this line, we present a new, historically themed core class: the Infantryman. Like other classes in the series, this core class is designed for maximum flexibility, with numerous options for developing your character without forcing you to multi-class between a number of similar, very narrow classes.<br/><br/>Second, a new craft skill is presented, giving you the tools to remake the battlefield in your favor. Take away your enemy&rsquo;s mobility and a small force of disciplined foot soldiers can defeat a much larger force, as witnessed by Henry V&rsquo;s stunning victory at the Battle of Agincourt.<br/><br/>And speaking of Agincourt, we follow up the crunch with a description of three pivotal battles from history where foot soldiers proved their worth and helped carry the day: the Battle of Hastings, the Battle of Arsuf and finally the Battle of Agincourt.<br/><br/>"}, "89836": {"rpg": {"524": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Clash of History: Witch Trials", "rpgproducer": {"16496": "David Jarvis"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic886875.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"78832": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic886875_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>In the Middle Ages, a witch panic swept Europe, holding many nations in its thrall for centuries.

If you are yearning for a system that feels more realistic than existing designs, yet is still as playable as the easiest in-depth RPG system, Pangenre is for you!<br/><br/>Pangenre is built from Open Game Content as defined in the Open Game License (OGL). This makes it easier for experienced players to assimilate sweeping changes to the character and combat systems. But Pangenre is not just another d20 clone or spin-off. It's a brand-new game system.<br/><br/>The Open Game &quot;core mechanic&quot; remains intact. Decide on your action, roll dice, add modifiers, and compare to the target DC. So if you know how to play Open Game rules, you're already halfway to learning Pangenre!<br/><br/>Improvements over Open Game Rules<br/>Pangenre RPG has many enhancements to the Open Game rules, such as:<br/><br/>     A brand-new character system completely replaces the Open Game concepts of levels and classes with skill-based mechanics. * Within skills, you can specialize in areas of knowledge or gain competencies in esoteric equipment with ease. Playable, pregenerated characters from different genres (modern, future, historical, and fantasy) show you how to craft characters.<br/>     Revised Ability scores that add new dimensions to characters such as Perception. Old geezers will no longer hear a pin drop by virtue of their high Wisdom.<br/>     Reducing the gaminess of other systems by eliminating hit points entirely. Instead, when you are struck by an attack, you make a wound check that is influenced by factors such as your overall strength and your armor. There is a limit to how many wounds you can take, and there is always the possibility that powerful blow can take down a mighty character. No more, &quot;Have the high hit point warrior run through the minefield,&quot; cheese!<br/>     Replacing the attack-of-opportunity mechanic with a reaction rule that fits much better in scenarios where firearms, especially modern or futuristic firearms, are in play.<br/>     The relationship between weapons and armor is much more realistic. Rather than prevent you from being struck by attacks, armor mitigates damage.<br/>     Simple, yet realistic language rules that use standardized skill concepts, are very simple to use, and fit as easily with scenarios where literacy is rare as with modern scenarios where you can learn to type and to read Braille.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The Pangenre RPG Core Rules&trade; is a game system rulebook, not a campaign sourcebook. It does not include scenario or campaign materials. Pangenre, LLC has released such materials seperately.

One of the central groups is in fact the OTO. The Magick system is based off of Aleister Crowley's vision of Magick (Magick is the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will). The Swing deals with Thelemic principles, as well as, other pagan cultures and as such the Magick system incorporates ideas and principles from other &ldquo;real world&rdquo; Magickal systems (such as Wicca, Voodoo, Alchemy and more).<br/><br/>The Swing is as detailed as possible in all aspects, characters, combat and Magick. By using The Step System, The Swing offers a highly realistic system without adding a lot of number crunching. Character creation is about defining well rounded believable characters. Combat is deadly, scary and dangerous. The Magick system is freeform and encourages the players to use out of game information. There is simple and easy to follow rules for bringing real world information into The Swing for use as player characters.<br/><br/>The basic premise is that Reality is like the swing of a pendulum. Sometimes it swings in one direction; sometimes it swings in the opposite direction. Sometimes reality is dragons and faeries, sometimes it lasers and computers. The Swing is about making your game into what you want it to be. The Swing is designed around the thought that a person&rsquo;s WILL can shape reality. A character&rsquo;s WILL can shape the game, the world and all those within.<br/><br/>This game will not be about how many creatures you can kill, it&rsquo;s about exploring the interaction between the WILL and reality.

The game does not follow the plotline of many other games in the Sonic series, and the game's plot is different in the Japanese and Western versions of the game. In the game, Tails must save an island from destruction by the Battle Kukku Army, an army of birds, while at the same time obtaining objects such as various types of weapons and Chaos Emeralds that he finds during his passage. The gameplay is unlike that of many other games in the series, consisting of slower travel, and more time is spent searching for objects to use later on in the game, rather than simply running through levels.<br/><br/>Contrary to the classic speedy gameplay in the Sonic series, Tails Adventures is a puzzle-based platformer with a strong emphasis on item collecting and backtracking, like a side-scrolling action RPG.<br/><br/>Tails can walk, jump, duck, look up, fly, hang on ledges, and can solve puzzles and defend himself with a range of different items, such as Hammers, various types of Bombs, and medallions bearing other characters, which allow him to perform additional actions, such as Spin-Dashing or punching enemies. His health is measured numerically by a Ring Item Box at the top left corner of the screen. HP is replenished by collecting Rings, which can be found by blowing up rocks or defeating enemies. He starts with 10 HP, but that number maxes out at 99 when all six Chaos Emeralds have been collected. His air time is limited by the flight gauge, which starts at about 3 seconds and maxes out at about 15.<br/><br/>The Japanese version of the game has a different plot line than the Western version of the game. However, the difference ends in the manual, because both the Japanese cartridge and the Western cartridge are identical.

He does not know of the true power of the Emeralds, but he does know the large, pretty gems would fetch a high price on the market, so he sets out to take them for himself before the others do. Now it's a mad four-sided race for the Chaos Emeralds.<br/><br/>The choice is given of playing as either Sonic or Tails. Sonic has the ability to do the Strike Dash/Super Peel Out as he does in Sonic Chaos that gives him a speed burst and temporary invincibility.

Four blue and three green scoring spaces are scattered on the track, and four summit spaces are found at the end of the track. Each player is dealt a hand of six cards, with cards coming in ten colors to match those of the dragons; each player also starts with a uniquely-colored card face-up on the table to indicate which dragon the player is riding.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player lays down one card from his hand, then advances the appropriately-colored dragon as many spaces as the number shown on the card. If another player has a card of this color in front of her, the player places the card on that player's stack; if not, the player places the card on his own stack, effectively changing steeds if the color differs from what was on top previously. (Exception: If a dragon not being ridden by anyone is in last place, the player may choose to place the card under his stack instead of on top of it, while moving the dragon normally.)<br/><br/>If a dragon moves onto a blue space, then each dragon on a space valued three or less scores that many points for the player riding that dragon, if any.

A WFF (pronounced &quot;woof&quot;) is a expression in a system of mathematical logic that is roughly equivalent to a sentence in English prose. In the WFF games, certain sequences of letters are considered WFFs, and players attempt to arrange an increasing number of letter dice to create ever-longer true sentences, or WFFs.<br/><br/>In Shake-a-WFF, the two players practice recognition and construction of WFFs. Players use six capital-letter dice, six small-letter dice, and a Shake-a-WFF playing mat (one mat each). Each player begins with three dice, and seeks to create a WFF using the letters they've rolled. Each round, players add or subtract a die from their shaking set according to whether they successfully created a WFF in the previous round or not. The first player to create a WFF with eight dice wins the game.<br/><br/>In Count-a-WFF, two or more players simultaneously view the same set of rolled dice to try to create the longest single WFF from the letters rolled.

Whether you know five Hawaiian words or five hundred, you can enjoy learning with friends and family as you race to complete your Hawaiian crossword.<br/><br/><br/>     Hulo! is themed after the old Hawaiian nupepa, or newspapers, which didn&rsquo;t have diacritics. So you can play without worrying about okina and kahako markings.    <br/>     Wondering if you can use people or place names? Hiki no! Go right ahead.

If you draw an Akau piece, you can force all players to pass two pieces of their choosing to the akau, right.<br/><br/>If you draw a Hema piece, you can force all players to pass two pieces of their choosing to the hema, left.<br/><br/>The Ku! piece is like a wildcard, so you can use it as any letter of your choosing. Or, if someone is winning and you want to stop their momentum, yell out &quot;Ku!&quot; to stop gameplay. You can then take one of their letters, replace it with the Ku! piece, and designate the Ku! piece as a different letter. Ho ke kolohe! What this means for your opponent is probably a lot of crossword rearranging! Minamina no hoi!<br/><br/>The Ea piece is the one everybody wants to have.

It has been translated into Korean and Chinese; an English-language beta version exists, but was never formally released. In this game, you are a war hero who raises a girl to the age of 18. At the end of the game, your daughter goes into a line of work; what this work is, how much talent she has for it, her marital life, and her overall happiness all depend on your actions.<br/><br/>The game takes place in a fantasy world presumably modeled after medieval Europe. The starting year is given as 1210 K.D. Your character is a famous warrior who defended the kingdom from an invasion by Lucifon, the Prince of Darkness (a corruption of Lucifer); consequently, you are known throughout the land as a military hero and receive an annual salary from the palace.<br/><br/>One night, your character receives a communication from a god whose identity is determined by the birthdate you select at the beginning of the game. This god bestows upon you a child of the heavens, and it is your duty to raise her from the age of 10 to the age of 18, at which point she will enter a line of work; the most desirable outcome is that of a royal princess, hence the name of the game.<br/><br/>Your daughter has a set of statistics that fluctuate depending on the activities you assign to her schedule, including various part-time jobs, schooling, adventure, and free time. It is these statistics that ultimately determine her final occupation, her skill level in her line of work, and her overall happiness in life; her marital fate is also decided, in part, by these statistics. The game also makes use of some invisible statistics to determine the occurrence of certain special events.<br/><br/>The god who visits your character is your daughter's patron god. That patron determines her starting statistics in such a way that is loosely related to the god's role in the Roman pantheon; for example, a girl born under Mars begins the game with an advantage in fighting reputation.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Princess Maker 2&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "89949": {"boardgamedesigner": {"8869": {"name": "Roberto Chiavini"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "From Mud to Glory: American Football", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"5640": "Sports: American Football / Gridiron"}, "average": "6.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"6597": {"name": "TCS Games"}}, "boardgameversion": {"79079": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1038": {"name": "Sports"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Statistical replay game on American Football, using a simple approach that consents to replay an entire season in a few hours.<br/>Each team is rated for TDs made and allowed (a different value for Run TD and Pass TD), plus FG attempts, FG %, P/K return TD made and allowed and TD scored by defence.<br/>In each match, both teams values are compared with a few tables and several dice rolls are made to determine the final score.<br/>As in most of TCS sport games, a random modifier is added under the form of the so called third die, a dice modifiers that adds spice and variations to the game<br/><br/>There are several different sets, each dedicated to a different NFL decade, or AFL<br/><br/>"}, "89950": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1275386.jpg", "poll": {}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1996", "maxplayers": "24", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4653": {"name": "Parker Spiele"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1275386_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "This edition of the TRIVIAL PURSUIT Year in Review Series contains questions about the highlights of the year 1997.

Together with Book 2: The Game Master&rsquo;s Starter Guide, this is the playtester&rsquo;s version of the Starter Kit for the Myth &amp; Magic Fantasy Role Playing Game. This set of books includes many of the updates and revisions that were suggested by active participants in the open playtest over the past several months. It includes certain expansions that the developers also wished to make. It would be a fair characterization to view this kit as the beta version of the rules and, as the playtest continues, the rules are subject to change. As we have constantly reinforced this ideal in the past, Myth &amp; Magic is very much a community game, and together we will continue to push the envelope to create the best game possible.<br/><br/>In the alpha release, now called the Classic Starter Kit, we presented a game that was, in many instances, an updated and streamlined version of the 2nd edition of the world&rsquo;s most popular roleplaying game. The Classic Starter Kit was not intended to be the final product. It was intended to be the foundation upon which we build new and exciting game mechanics as a community. The rules are open content, so we were able to discuss the rules and revise them.<br/><br/>This revised Starter Kit incorporates some monumental changes. The first change (but certainly not the largest) took place in the combat mechanic. Armor Class is still ascending, but the base was changed to 10. The &quot;To Hit&quot; value was replaced by a Base to Hit bonus. These changes to the combat system bring the attack resolution system of Myth &amp; Magic more in line with games like Castles &amp; Crusades, the 3rd Edition and Pathfinder. The combat is still imaginative and no emphasis was placed on miniatures, movement or range to retain the tone of classic play.<br/><br/>We added a seventh attribute: Perception. For this, we thank Thomas Ruddick and the then editors of Dragon Magazine. In Issue #133 (May, 1988), Mr. Ruddick authored an article entitled, &quot;Notice Anything Different&quot;, which allowed for the introduction of a seventh attribute to the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&trade; roleplaying game. Since that May of 1988, no iteration of the world&rsquo;s most popular role playing game included this seventh stat, although its inclusion was sensible and Mr. Ruddick&rsquo;s article sold the attribute properly. Myth &amp; Magic breaks this trend and it is a better game for it.<br/><br/>There are other changes, of course. We added classes, races, spells, proficiencies, equipment, rules and more!<br/><br/>The introduction of the BASE20 system to Myth &amp; Magic is perhaps the largest change, though. It impacts the proficiency system dramatically and it creeps up in other aspects of the game. The BASE20 system is a ladder of complexity and it is used to quickly gauge the difficulty of a given task and the required roll to succeed. Almost all skill-based tasks use the ladder, so if you can remember the BASE20 system, you can easily master the entire non-combat system. It is a major streamline that makes playing and running the game much easier.<br/><br/>"}, "89964": {"boardgamedesigner": {"6679": {"name": "Sallent Hermanos"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Ocean Surprise", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "1990", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic991235_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2157": {"name": "Educa Borras"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic991235.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"79110": "Spanish edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Components<br/>   Game Board with Rotating Centre<br/>   4 White Boats<br/>   12 Playing Pawns (3 each of 4 color)<br/>   1 Dice<br/>   Instructions Booklet.<br/><br/>Objective:<br/>To race other players through the jungle and the rotating sea board and be the first to jump into the safety boats.<br/><br/>Players control 3 pawns that move on the roll of one d6.

They know their nuke will wipe out all traces of their crimes when the Countdown ends, but what of the small chance that a survivor escapes with the Hermit and his Intel?<br/><br/>Enter the MBI Black Ops squad, a team of 5 deadly Soldiers under the command of the ruthless Chrissy. Will they pick off any lucky survivors before the Countdown wipes out the rest of them? Or will they fall victim to the heroes much like the horde of Undead surrounding them all?<br/><br/>Introducing a new playable character, CHRISSY: the fair-haired Controller of the Black Ops squad. Ant was once his greatest student until Chrissy's thirst for innocent blood turned the young soldier against his team and into a life of isolation. Now armed with an even deadlier group of 5 Black Ops Soldiers, Chrissy has been sent into the heart of Zombie-infested Endicott with a simple mission from the heads of MBI: kill everyone and everything before it can escape the end of the Nuclear Countdown.<br/><br/>Hidden within the play deck amongst the flesh-craving Undead are the five Black Ops Soldiers. Uncover one, and become marked for execution. Try to fend off the Soldier with all your might until the sneaky assassins slither back into hiding within the remainder of the deck. Beware, once you are marked you run the risk of being executed sooner than you think! Take a breather from combating the Undead in order to attempt to remove the marks; but don't spend too much time to yourself - every attempt to remove a mark, whether successful or not, will cost you some of your slain Zombies.<br/><br/>When the time comes, Chrissy will send out the command to his Soldiers to EXECUTE! Roll the die when the command is drawn; the matching marks are instantly executed and players take damage (potentially fatal, if you have a hard time removing your marks). But that's not all - sometimes the Execute commands will allow more than one Soldier to execute their marks, spelling certain doom for any players who have unwillingly collected a variety of marks from several different Soldiers. If you fall victim to one of the Soldiers, respawning is no longer an option. You are instantly killed and any Cure cards you were holding become compromised with the Solders' evil decoy-deception. Now your allies must roll a successful Cure Retrieval value TWICE before they can take the Cure card and win the game.<br/><br/>Despite their advantages in both stealth and strength, the Black Ops Soldiers are still only human. If you can manage to do so, killing one will reward you dearly - not in points and not in monetary value, but with the knowledge that you and your comrades can walk the desolate streets of an apocalyptic Endicott with a bit more safety. But beware - the Zombies still run amok, and they LOVE adrenaline-pumped prey!<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>18 Game Cards <br/>88 5/8&quot; Chits <br/> 7 Game Mats<br/> 1 Full Color 2-sided rules sheet<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"79151": "First Edition"}, "name": "Endicott Epidemic: Infectious Contagion Expansion #1 \u2013 Black Ops", "playingtime": "40", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "0", "expands": {"85253": {"name": "Endicott Epidemic: Infectious Contagion"}}, "average": "0"}, "89998": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Batman Returns (Sega CD)", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"135071": "English/European Sega CD edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic899689.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2279": "Comics"}, "videogamegenre": {"2161": "Action Adventure"}, "average": "5.75", "videogamefranchise": {"5735": "Batman"}, "videogameplatform": {"4436": "SEGA CD"}, "usersrated": "4", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic899689_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>The Penguin and the Red Triangle Circus Gang have Gotham City in a death grip!
