Now, you are a lab tech on the spaceship, Innovation, coming to explore the Enyo. You have been instructed by command to take a crew of scientists to pilot-test a new machine designed to purify air and stabilize the environments of spaceships where the hull has been fatally breached. Rather than test this machine by crashing service ships into things, the tests of this machine are taking place on shipwrecks throughout the galaxy. This is the first time the machine, the Magnapur42, will be tested in a non-simulated shipwreck environment. The wreck has been deemed safe, and you and some other team-members have come aboard.

It is the sequel to the WWE Raw game that was released in 2002.<br/><br/>For the first time in the series, a season mode is included in the game. It allows players to set up wrestlers, call others out from the locker room, form alliances, and hire managers. To successfully complete a season, the player is required to play through 12 months of Raw and SmackDown! shows, as well as Pay-Per-View events, and finish the season with either the WWE Championship, or the World Heavyweight Championship. Successful seasons earn points, which can be seen in the 'Hall of Fame' section of the main menu of the game, which in turn unlocks items of clothing and entrance videos which can later be used in the creation or modification of characters.<br/><br/>Raw 2 allows players to edit WWE's wrestlers into the way they want them to look similar to the N64 games WWF WrestleMania 2000 and WWF No Mercy.<br/><br/>The game features several arenas that WWE held events in during 2002 and 2003. There are also arenas based upon each WWE television show. The game also features Raw and Smackdown! referees in the game that the player can choose.<br/><br/>New match stipulations are included in the game: Hell in a Cell, TLC and Royal Rumble matches are available in Raw 2.<br/><br/>Upon its release, the game was praised for an improved and more current roster. The game received 'average' reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Many praised the creation modes, but criticized the gameplay.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw_2 WWE Raw 2]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "198685": {"boardgamedesigner": ["P.

We have made every effort to replicate the look and feel of the original show&hellip;.<br/><br/>This app includes Bob Holness, the original music and game sounds, original question content and the original title sequence.<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>Blockbusters was a highly popular British TV show (though originally based on an American format) hosted by Bob Holness. Students, one single and one team of two, would compete to answer questions to fill in hexagons on a grid. Each hexagon was filled with a letter, and the answer to the question started with that letter. If a team answered a question correctly it would turn their colour (white or blue) and they could then choose the next location on the grid, leading to the famous catchphrase &quot;Can I have a 'P' please, Bob?&quot; (having a Pee is British slang for urinating).<br/><br/>The aim of the game is for the single student (playing white) to connect from top to bottom, a minimum of four spaces, and for the pair of students to connect from left to right, a minimum of five spaces.<br/><br/>Winning would allow the team to progress to the Gold Run, where a single student (the pair would alternate if they won multiple times) would attempt to cross a more complicated version of the board.<br/><br/>This version recreates the TV show in its entirety, including the music, title-sequence and sound effects. It even lets the player choose a mascot for their desk.<br/><br/>It can be played single-player against a computer opponent, or two-player as pass-and-play, using Bluetooth, or over the Internet.<br/><br/>When playing two-player, the board is switched to a 5 by 5 grid, to take account of the fact that the blue team does not have the same advantage as on the TV show.<br/><br/>Additional question packs are available as in-app purchases.<br/><br/>"}, "198703": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Looking In Episode II: The Air Up Thaere", "rpgdesigner": ["Morrie Mullins", "Lee Pickler"], "rpgproducer": ["Morrie Mullins", "Lee Pickler"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2990439.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Star Wars"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Space Opera)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Wizards of the Coast"], "rpg": ["Star Wars (WotC Original Edition)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Living Force", "Looking In Trilogy"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2990439_t.png", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>A refueling stop becomes problematic when something is discovered to be wrong with the ship the heroes are piloting.

Strong, fast, and skilled in battle, Kogar is a tough visitor to any planet. Unfortunately, he&rsquo;s not exactly concerned with obeying local customs or checking in with the local law. In fact, he&rsquo;s not entirely sure what the locals look like, he&rsquo;s only concerned with tracking down his quarry and cashing them in for a bounty before moving on to his next mission! Any hero who gets in his way will find him occasionally reasonable, but no less annoying for it. On the other hand, his space-ship&rsquo;s ability to travel anywhere in the known universe might just make him the ally your heroes never knew they needed.

It is a spin-off of the original Snatcher, adapting the same storyline into a different genre. In contrast to the original game's realistic art style, SD Snatcher features a &quot;super deformed&quot; art style, depicting all of the game's characters with big heads and childlike proportions (only the game's ending deviates from this style and reverts to the original game's realistic style).<br/><br/>As with most RPGs released at the time, the game consists of overhead exploration of areas and menu-driven turn-based battles. However, it discards random encounters and introduces a battle system which uses a first-person perspective that allows the player to aim at specific body parts of an enemy and disable certain characteristics. For example, shooting a robot's wheels or legs will render the robot immobile, making it less likely to avoid the player's gunfire, attacking its weapon will reduce its strength, or continuously attacking its weak point could lead to a potentially quicker victory. As with other RPGs, the player can upgrade their weapon and purchase auxiliary items that can be used in battle to make battles easier. The game also introduces an auto-battle feature, where Metal Gear Petit can take control of the battle. Each of the firearm weapons have different abilities and target ranges as well as limited ammunition that needs to be brought or found separately.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SD_Snatcher SD Snatcher]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "198783": {"rpgdesigner": ["Kevin Omans"], "rpgitemversion": ["Multimedia Version"], "poll": [], "name": "I Left My Journal on Zont", "rpgartist": ["Kevin Omans"], "rpgproducer": ["Kevin Omans"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2991709.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["I Left My Journal on Zont"], "rpgpublisher": ["Zontco LLC"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpgseries": ["Game Chef 2014: The Unbound Edition"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2991709_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>I Lost My Journal on Zont is a GM-less story-telling game where the players imagine things and places on the alien planet Zont.

Even the greatest kingdoms begin as small townships, therefore players begin with only a basic town hall, a couple of peons, and a single warrior. From there, players must explore the territory around them, build up their work force, fortify their army, and develop their kingdom &mdash; all through careful action selection, exploitation, war, and resource management.<br/><br/>As players reach milestones in the development of their kingdom, they gain access to many advantages.

When the dead rose, you thought that they would be the biggest threat. You were wrong. Your supplies are running low. Medicine and food are nearly gone. The group decided that you will make the next run. You thought that you had prepared for this. You weren&rsquo;t ready for them but they were ready for you.<br/><br/>District-Z: The Cult is a stand-alone game and does not require the original District-Z to play. This is a Choose Your Own Adventure-style game that will take you from your first steps outside of your small compound and into a harried run from a mysterious Cult that is always on your trail. You will choose your own path. Will you take down the Cult or will you be converted?<br/><br/>The CULT GAME BOOK: This is the story that you must encounter. You will read a page and attempt to overcome the challenges presented. You may be presented with a choice of which test to perform on the card. The choices will be separated by the keyword &ldquo;OR&rdquo; and this allows you to choose one of the tests to<br/>complete while ignoring the other test (unless the page states otherwise). Once the test has been performed, perform the appropriate SUCCESS or FAILURE result.<br/><br/>DICE<br/>The dice in District-Z: The Cult are customized with symbols representing each of a SURVIVOR&rsquo;S ATTRIBUTES as well as the dreaded AUTO-FAIL result. If you roll an AUTO-FAIL result you may not reroll that die during your reroll attempts.<br/><br/>CULT Cards represent the constant threat of the Cult and are used to change the game causing difficulties for the Player via increased challenges, reduction in stats, and even causing you to perform all tasks on a page.<br/><br/>Items and Companion cards represent the Items and Companions that you may come across during the game. These cards are attached to your character mat and you may use their special abilities to assist you in defeating the challenges.<br/><br/>The Survivor mats are where you will track the changes that your Survivor goes through. You will, through the course of the game, be able to increase the basic stats of your character, gain experience, and earn special abilities which are all tracked on this mat.<br/><br/>The game involves the player reading a scenario in the Cult book and then performing one of the tests on the page by rolling the number of dice equal to the abilities in the test. For example: Let's say that you are on a page that has you testing AGILITY and PERCEPTION. You would look at your mat and see that you have 2 PERCEPTION and 3 AGILITY. You would roll 5 dice and try to gain enough of each symbol to match the test's requirement. Let us assume that the test says AGILITY:2 and PERCEPTION:1. With your 5 dice, you would have to roll 2 AGILITY symbols and 1 PERCEPTION symbol. You do get to reroll your dice twice for a total of 3 rolls (unless an ability or card states otherwise) but you may not reroll the AUTO-FAIL dice.<br/><br/>The game ends when the players reach one of the different endings.

Suddenly, an earthquake shook the chemical warehouse and the walkway he was standing on gave way. He screamed in horror as he tumbled into the vat with the walkway.<br/><br/>The chemicals in the vat seeped into his body. First he was changed from a solid state into a pure liquid one as he was liquefied in the vat. Then then vat bubbled over and when it popped, he evaporated into a cloud of chemicals as a gas state. It was an odd feeling of transmogrification as he felt like he was looking at the process as a casual outside observer rather than as a part of it. He watched as his new body expanded and the chemicals in his new form washed over the employees in the facility, asphyxiating them and burning their skin horribly. Tanks ruptured and chemical drums burst spilling their contents on the floor. There was also the blood that spilled out of the dying as their skin finally peeled away. The windows became stained a permanent green color as he touched them. The chemical inspector couldn&rsquo;t feel anymore, he was nothing but a cloud of ever expanding death just waiting to be released again to diffuse throughout the atmosphere if the chemical warehouse were to be opened up after the horrific accident.<br/><br/>"}, "198931": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "rpgseries": ["Game Chef 2015: A Different Audience"], "name": "Dwolma", "rpgdesigner": ["David King"], "rpgproducer": ["David King"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2995273.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Dwolma"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2995273_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>This storytelling game is for exactly three players.

Many of the plane&rsquo;s creative roots lie in D&amp;D, so it should be no surprise that The Art of Magic: The Gathering &mdash; Zendikar feels a lot like a D&amp;D campaign setting book. It&rsquo;s littered with adventure hooks and story seeds, and lacks only the specific rules references you&rsquo;d need to adapt Zendikar&rsquo;s races, monsters, and adventures to a tabletop D&amp;D campaign. And it&rsquo;s all surrounded by amazing fantasy art that holds boundless inspiration in itself.<br/><br/>You can think of Plane Shift: Zendikar as a sort of supplement to The Art of Magic: The Gathering &mdash; Zendikar, designed to help you take the world detail and story seeds contained in that book and turn them into an exciting D&amp;D campaign. The easiest way to approach a D&amp;D campaign set on Zendikar is to use the rules that D&amp;D provides mostly as written: A druid on Zendikar might call on green mana and cast spells like giant growth, but she&rsquo;s still just a druid in the D&amp;D rules (perhaps casting giant insect).<br/><br/>Plane Shift: Zendikar was made using the fifth edition of the D&amp;D rules that you can find here. D&amp;D is a flexible rules system designed to model any kind of fantasy world. The D&amp;D magic system doesn&rsquo;t involve five colors of mana or a ramping-up to your most powerful spells, but the goal isn&rsquo;t to mirror the experience of playing Magic in your roleplaying game. The point is to experience the worlds of Magic in a new way, through the lens of the D&amp;D rules. All you really need is races for the characters, monsters for them to face, and some ideas to build a campaign.<br/><br/>Finally, The Art of Magic: The Gathering &mdash; Zendikar will help you create a D&amp;D campaign in Zendikar, but you don&rsquo;t actually need the book to make use of this material &mdash; you can also refer to the abundance of lore about Zendikar found on magicthegathering.com.<br/><br/>"}, "198938": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["YouTube Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Glitter Nomic", "rpgdesigner": ["Joseph Reid", "Morgan Stinson"], "rpggenre": ["Politics / Government"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2995278.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgproducer": ["Morgan Stinson", "Emily Stinson"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Glitter Nomic"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "average": "0", "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpgseries": ["Game Chef 2014: The Unbound Edition"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2995278_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>Glitter Nomic is presented as a series of four YouTube videos that feature Great Leader as he presents the phases and rules of the game.

You may track a nest of spiders to the Smokeblue Hills, or delve deep into tunnels that riddle the ground beneath Terrinoth. Fortunately, a new hero also arrives to save Terrinoth with this expansion: Jonas the Kind.

Welcome to the grimdark. Welcome to DAYNIGHTZ&trade;&rdquo;<br/><br/>Dawn breaks on the refuge, and the sunrays bring you the feared news&hellip;the day has come, the day to go back to the city. When this damned thing started, you joined a group of survivors that had gathered in the woods, fleeing from the city. With tremendous effort, you erected a makeshift refuge to fend off the foul creatures, waiting for the army to come and save you. However, help is not coming, you know that now. And so do the traitors who quietly left the refuge last night, taking most of the remaining supplies with them. Now you are forced to go back to the city: It&rsquo;s the only option if you want to survive another day&hellip;<br/><br/>This is the starting point of DAYNIGHTZ&trade;. You get to pick a group of up to 4 survivors, each with its own character sheet that shows its attributes and abilities, a backpack and some equipment. Now you&rsquo;re ready to start your adventure in a nightmare world, where the dead rule above the living.<br/><br/><br/>What is your goal?<br/><br/>That depends on the game mode chosen:<br/><br/>-&gt; In campaign mode you will have to brave narrative missions where you will have to fight and take difficult decisions, that will determine your progress, culminating in one of three possible endings.<br/>-&gt; In survival mode you will roam from city to city, with complete freedom to do whatever it takes to survive another day on this hell on earth.<br/><br/><br/>How are you going to achieve your goal?<br/><br/>The game is divided in 3 segments: Adventure Phase, Travel Phase and Refuge Phase.<br/><br/>1) Adventure Phase: This is the most important phase of the game. In it, players will roam the streets and alleys of the city, exploring locales, suffering encounters and generally trying to keep a low profile while striving to achieve their goals (established by the campaign mission in the campaign mode or by their own interests in the survival mode).<br/><br/>One of the many things that set DAYNIGHTZ&trade; apart from other games is that is played on TWO LEVELS. What does that mean?<br/><br/>On one hand there is the City board, consisting of a labyrinth of streets, alleys, surprise zones and locations. On the other hand, whenever the players want to explore a certain location, or due to the triggering of events and conditions, players will lay out tiles to represent that particular location. Each location has its own set of tiles, depending on its nature. For example, the Firemen Park location consists of the parking tile, the locker room tile and the offices tile.<br/><br/>2) Travel Phase: Once the Adventure Phase is finished, survivors will have to trudge back to their refuge with their meager loot. In this phase survivors will have to face different situations, like zombie encounters, coming across abandoned structures (farms, etc) and being assaulted by other survivor groups.<br/><br/>3) Refuge Phase: This is a management phase, where survivors will have to handle, upgrade and defend their base. While in the refuge survivors can do a lot of stuff: recover from their wounds/infections, level up, stock supplies, farm food, upgrade the refuge&rsquo;s defenses&hellip;The refuge, though, will be attacked regularly by either roamer&rsquo;s packs or other survivor groups, who can also steal and sabotage your base. That is more likely to happen if you&rsquo;re away for extended periods, so try to do your city supply runs as fast as possible&hellip;<br/><br/><br/>What is the core mechanic?<br/><br/>DAYNIGHTZ&trade; is based on a double profile system, for both the zombies and the survivors: during the day, zombies use their worse profile, while during the night, zombie use their better profile and survivors will use their worse profile, unless they&rsquo;re equipped with a light source&hellip;which are obviously very scarce and run out very fast! The day and night cycle is controlled through a timetable located on the City board.<br/><br/>On top of that, other elements can make the brave survivor&rsquo;s life even more difficult:<br/><br/>- Threat Counter: Consists of a counter that increases as a result of diverse things happening, like survivors making noise, environmental effects, zombies amassing, etc. The higher the Threat counter, the higher the risk the survivors are taking by staying in the city.<br/><br/>- Threat Encounters: Each end of turn you will verify the conditions stated in a card. If you meet the conditions, you will suffer a Threat encounter. That might not happen very frequently but&hellip;beware when it does happen!<br/><br/>- The Hunter: The Hunter is the most dangerous zombie in the game. Luckily, it only appears at night; unfortunately, when it appears it will attack all the survivors who are out in the open (in streets and alleys). So keep this in mind: you don&rsquo;t want to be wandering around in the open at night!<br/><br/>- Survivor&rsquo;s health and stress: DAYNIGHTZ&trade; is a very realistic game. Thus, the more wounded your survivor is, the more difficult it will be for him/her to accomplish actions (in combat or out of it). Also, your survivor will be able to do less actions the more wounded he/she is. Stress is also key, as your survivor will be affected by events depending on their stress level, which can also impact on their attribute checks.<br/><br/>- Infection: Survivors can get infected when wounded by a zombies, while searching corpses or by other special effects. Once infected, the disease will deteriorate the survivor and if not treated, will end up killing him/her. Of course, the infection will be more easily neutered in its early stages; the more you wait, the harder it will be to remove it. While infected, your survivor will periodically succumb to its effects, which can make them bleed, make them slower, etc.<br/><br/>To help them deal with the situations that they will find themselves in, the survivors can use a lot of items that they will find in their city wanderings. However, all said items will either need consumables in order to function or will wear away with use&hellip;<br/><br/>The players will also encounter other survivors and animals during their travels, which, depending on the decisions previously taken and the success in the encounters, can join their group as allies. Allies can give a series of bonuses to the survivors, but will not remain with them forever: allies have their own loyalty system, which depends on the actions taken by the players. The way you treat them will determine how they treat you!<br/><br/>All the points above, plus others that you will discover during gameplay, set DAYNIGHTZ&trade; apart from other zombie-themed games.

Shopping and cooking or going out to various eateries is central to the strategy that is balanced by physically activity to help you burn extra calories. Points are earned by completing recipes and activities, but ultimately, giving your body what it needs to stay healthy earns the most points, as various diseases can sneak up on you if you're not careful.<br/><br/>Over six rounds, players will select actions on the main game board, as well as their player board, such as cooking or going out to eat. To cook, players must first go grocery shopping for ingredients, but careful planning is needed as food can expire if it isn't used in time, and fighting your cravings may cause a few problems too. Completing recipes unlocks extra abilities, which can be very useful during the game.<br/><br/>Eating out is also an option, and going to the buffet or visiting the stands at the farmer's market can be tempting - decisions may depend on what they have to offer. While cooking allows players more control over what they eat, and provides points, it can be hard to resist the drive-thru when you can get so much food! All food, represented by colored cubes, goes into the player's &quot;body&quot; based on different food groups, and as the game progresses, it is possible that players may find they have eaten too much of one or more groups. Time to exercise!<br/><br/>Through a variety of activities, players may remove cubes from their body to return to a healthier state, but don't wait too long as this may require more time than you think! Completed activities offer end-game points, so don&rsquo;t be a couch potato! After six rounds, players see which of their food needs have been met and how many different activities they have completed, and the player with the most points is the winner!<br/> Consumption is fun, easy to learn, and offers deep strategy and intuitive mechanics.

The performance of your 'mech will degrade as damage is received but you get the opportunity to repair in between enemy waves.<br/><br/>There are currently 13 weapons to choose from, with 4 mounting points on your 'mech so there is plenty of variety to be found - you can also beef up the armour on your legs and torso but watch out for your overall weight!

Watch out, as you and your fellow monkey climbers must escape his hazardous spells. Bananas, faeries and anvils, oh my! You never know what Kurgill will throw at you next. Only the Treetop is safe. Climb as quickly as you can, battle to knock each other down, dodge the traps, and above all, beware of the Gnome. It&rsquo;s a race to the top.<br/><br/>Monkey is a fast-paced, goofy card game where the odds are against you. It can be played with up to 4 players and even includes a solitaire mode. Each player is a monkey who starts at the bottom of the collective &ldquo;Tree.&rdquo; Four cards make up the &ldquo;Trunk&rdquo; of the Tree and three cards make up the &ldquo;Treetop.&rdquo; Each turn starts with you drawing a card into your hand from the draw pile, then flipping over the top card of the &ldquo;Spell Deck&rdquo; (usually this &ldquo;spell&rdquo; harms you, but you might get lucky!). Finally, you get two Action Points (APs) to spend during your turn. You can spend APs to draw cards, to attempt to climb up the Tree (ie. to the next position up), or to set traps to impede the progress of other players. Each Tree card (whether a Trunk or Treetop card) has a number (1-10, 15 or 20), which is colored (yellow, blue, green, red, black or multicolored). Each time a player attempts to climb a Tree card they combine cards from their hand until their sum exceeds the number on the Tree card. But there&rsquo;s a twist: color matters! If the Tree card is red, yellow, green or blue, then the player may use anything except that color in their attempt to climb. (For example, if the Tree card is a yellow 10, a player could combine a blue 6 and a green 5 to beat it. However, a player could not have used a yellow 15 to beat it since the Tree card itself was yellow and such &quot;color matching&quot; is not allowed). There are two exceptions: Black can only be beaten by black, and multicolored cards can be beaten by any cards.<br/><br/>Just when you think you have it, Kurgill the Wizard might prevent you from climbing, or even worse, might send you falling back down the Tree. The standard gameplay will keep you entertained, but in case you want to mix it up, Monkey also has three variations: &ldquo;Insane Mode,&rdquo; in which you remove the main good cards from the Spell Deck; &ldquo;Super-Tree,&rdquo; in which each player has their own Trunk to climb but a shared Treetop from which they can oust other players; and finally &ldquo;Krazy Kurgz,&rdquo; in which Kurgill the Wizard joins as an opponent to all players, to wreak havoc along with his birdie minions.

It helps develop tolerance to frustration, healthy competition and the development of strategies throughout the game to solve problems.<br/><br/>Alternatives for playing the game: The game has 10 alternatives that can be played which allows the child to practice mathematical operation of multiplication in different manners ensuring the continued use without boring the game participants.<br/><br/>Meaningful learning is learning that students understand while they are learning. Meaningful learning is the leading trend for more useful and significant learning and how it is retained. This learning serves as to use what they have learned in new situations, in different contexts, so more than memorizing, this learning must be understood asimilated. Meaningful learning is thus opposed to mechanical learning.<br/><br/>This Foundation certifies: The game HoliMaths X is an innovative educational tool for comprehensive learning of the mathematical operation of multiplication. Our Foundation recommends it as a learning tool for organizational, familiar and educational environments.<br/><br/>We will summarize one of the ten ways to play, the &quot;original&quot; game play:<br/>6 problem cards and 6 solution cards are given out to 2-6 players. You must try to match the cards through its correct multiplicating result, after being able to have two matches in hand, you can lower them for everybody to see. You can use the wild cards as whatever you need. Now we are playing!<br/>On every turn you get a new problem and solution card or you can use the top card of the discarded ones of each.  <br/>Everybody will do the same and now the game shifts into a drafting card game with multiple possibilties to &quot;give problems&quot;, be very alert to commutation and holimaths special plays in which strategy of what cards to play or keep, while combining with the wild cards that are on the table, that can be replaced in your turn if you happen to have the card it represents, along with making decisions on who to play your cards to, giving it an interesting pace, along with the alertness, strategy, logical thinking needed to win the game. <br/>Luck is not essential and even if it takes a couple of rounds for you to have the two matches that allows you to interact, you can turn it around with the correct cards and awareness, and win the game which is won by the player that gains the most points. Each card has a symbol which has to with how much that result is present in the game. There is a symbol score card with how many points each symbol on each card is worth. Value depends of how many times that result is available in the deck. Thus, prime numbers are worth the most. <br/>It may sound hard, but guys, this is a kids game...this is very easy to understand in a single 20 minute game play. <br/>The game ends when any player has no cards to play and no unsolved problems. There will be positive and negative points based on the symbols of every card. Simple to add up and to continue with another game or skip to the other 3 strategy games or the other 6 training ways to play HoliMaths X.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "7", "name": "HoliMaths X", "playingtime": "40", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Co-operative Play", "Memory"], "average": "7.25", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Card Games: Draw and Discard Games", "Card Games: Matching Games", "Wild Cards"]}, "198625": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["HTML Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Court of the Dragon Emperor", "rpgdesigner": ["Mike Holmes", "Joe Jeskiewicz"], "rpgproducer": ["Joe Jeskiewicz"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2990126.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Animal (Anthropomorphic)", "Politics / Government"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpg": ["The Pool"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2990126_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>Court of the Dragon Emperor is a game about animals trying to better themselves through intrigue, adventure, and conspiracy.

Refight the legendary battles of the period&ndash;Castiglione, Rivoli, Marengo, Austerlitz, Friedland, Borodino, Salamanca, Ligny, Waterloo&ndash;with this meticulously researched rules manual.<br/><br/>In Revolution &amp; Empire players take the role of the great commanders of the period such as Napoleon, Wellington, Blucher, Charles, Suvorov, Mass&eacute;na, and Lannes. Draw up your preliminary battle-plans in hopes of achieving your own decisive victory and watch as subordinates carry it to fruition. Revolution &amp; Empire reflects the intense friction of war during this era, as billowing smoke and thunderous cannonades obscured the battlefield and increased the intense confusion and pressures of battle, and even the best plans can go awry by the accidents of war. Skillful management of reserves plays a decisive role in determining the outcome, as fresh troops must be carefully preserved to respond to the inevitable crisis of the battle.<br/><br/>At the tactical level, players performing as division and corps commanders are faced with mastering the interaction of combined arms. No other period of history presents such a balance, as each arm&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses are dramatically highlighted. Perhaps as no system before, Revolution &amp; Empire demonstrates the evolution of tactics throughout the entire period, from the demise Frederick the Great&rsquo;s linear style of warfare to the development of a new tactical system for a new age. With Revolution &amp; Empire, players will also foster a new appreciation for the brilliant tactics of generals like Wellington and Davout, men who won astonishing victories against staggering odds.<br/><br/>Revolution &amp; Empire is also a valuable historical reference, as hundreds of generals and units are rated on their performance during the period in order to reflect their historical capabilities. Comprehensive rules reflect the many salient aspects of Napoleonic and Revolutionary combat, including massed skirmishers, grand batteries, fatigue, savage town fighting, bridge assaults, weather, and ammunition supply. Whether re-fighting the famous battles, or recreating the scores of smaller actions from the period, Revolution &amp; Empire elegantly reflects warfare in this fascinating and turbulent period of military history.<br/><br/>"}, "198630": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2991951.png", "boardgameimplementation": ["Hold the Line"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Matt Burchfield", "Grant Wylie", "Mike Wylie"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Sean Cooke"], "boardgamepublisher": ["PSC Games", "Worthington Publishing, LLC"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2991951_t.png", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["American Revolutionary War", "Game System"], "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Hold the Line, The American Revolution is an innovative collaboration between Worthington Publishing and The Plastic Soldier Company/PSC Games to reproduce and remaster some of Worthington Games original titles.

The practitioner of shadow  forms knows when to fade into the background, and when to obscure his very elemental lineage by tapping into whatever seems useful from the other elements. Slipping into shadow-based stances merely enables rapid shifting to another stance; in short, shadow's identity is that of no identity.

A combination of martial artist and cosmological politician, the drifting one affects a manner that attracts the elements, but never stays in one place long enough for the shallowness of his understanding to become fully known. The drifting one constantly shifts from element to element, constantly one step ahead of the primal forces that would disown him were they ever to reveal the nature of his game.<br/>    Elemental Partisan - Though the elements exist in harmony, those who seek to understand them may believe one to be superior. The elemental partisan locks out one element in order to grant a small subset of new forms to another element, allowing for deeper character customization.<br/>    Unbalanced Master - Similar to the elemental partisan, the unbalanced master finds one particular element easier to understand. No element is completely turned away, for the unbalanced master still attempts to embrace all, but the greatest powers among the other elements are permanently shut out to him. In recompense, the deeper understanding afforded to his favored element grants a unique pool ability based on the favored element chosen.<br/>    Vessel of Darkness - It is said that a system is only defined when it is observed. Who, or what, observes when nobody is around? The Darkness does. It lurks in the far corner beneath your bed, in the deepest of the ocean's depths, and within the void of interstellar space. It is the unknown personified, an entity so alien that it flees before mere baryonic observation, let along direct opposition. It is not good or evil. It is the eye of Elsewhere, and, for purposes unknown, it seeks to understand its neighbors.<br/><br/><br/>Masters of Forms count Darkness as one of the primal powers of the universe, equal in import to fire, ice, and their peers, but the nature of the Darkness ensures it stays at arm's length, and a true understanding eludes most. Rarely, however, Elsewhere reaches out to specific baryonic entities, and if an accord is met, when the baryonic looks into the Darkness, the Darkness, unblinking, always observing, can look back.<br/><br/>"}, "198640": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Blinking Eyes Episode II: Halves", "rpgdesigner": ["Lee Pickler"], "rpgproducer": ["Lee Pickler"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2988474.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Star Wars"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Space Opera)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Wizards of the Coast"], "rpg": ["Star Wars (WotC Original Edition)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Blinking Eyes Trilogy", "Living Force"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2988474_t.png", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>The political maneuverings between the cities of Gadrin and Hedrett have escalated.

They were more settlers than they were raiders, for instance. They bathed more than most of their European peers, and were quite fond of jewelry and fancy duds. One thing continues to hold true though. They loved to party, and would often hold feasts in mead halls (community longhouses) that lasted many days. The primary drink at these feasts was mead (honey wine or beer), and competitions were held to see who could hold their drink the longest while remaining standing and spouting poetry eloquently (yes, Vikings were some of the earliest poets).<br/><br/>In Don&rsquo;t Fall in the Mead Hall, players emulate a host of Vikings drinking the night away in a mead hall. Although drinking while playing is encouraged, this is more of a party game with a fair share of strategy than it is a straight-up drinking game. Each player controls a table that starts with four Vikings (multi-colored pawns). A six-sided die is placed on the table with the number &ldquo;1&rdquo; facing up. This is the drunk die or &ldquo;Odin&rsquo;s Breathalyzer.&rdquo; <br/> After each player rolls a 20-sided die to determine initiative for the round, they then take turns rolling the action die. The results of the action die vary from taking a drink, to sending a drink to another table, to calling out a &ldquo;skal&rdquo; (toast) to cause all of the tables to drink, to throwing a chair at another table, to challenging another Viking at the battle mat. Each drink the Vikings at your table take causes the drunk die to move up by one. Taking a drink while the die is on six will result in a passed out Viking. The player lays that Viking on its side by the table (that Viking is out of the game), then sets the drunk die back to one. <br/> Vikings are also out of the game if they lose at the battle mat. Battle is performed by rolling the attack dice. Either one player wins, both players get knocked down, or nothing happens (two blanks are rolled) because the Vikings are too drunk to fight. Additionally, Vikings will move from table to table for various reasons depending on the die roll. Players do not have ultimate control over any of the Vikings but rather control a table. Once all of their Vikings have passed out, been knocked out, or have moved onto another table, they are out of the game. They still have a chance to get back in the game if gameplay results in a Viking being sent back to their empty table. The player controlling the table with the last Viking standing in the mead hall is the winner.<br/><br/>Contains small parts for easy traveling (but not for swallowing!).
