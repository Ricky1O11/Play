Each player has only two of these timers available, so you'll need to keep a cool head and your communication channels wide open to arrange for the most opportune deals with each of the other players!<br/><br/>While Time 'N' Space is played in exactly 30 minutes, a 12-minute introductory game is also included.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"207531": "English first edition"}, "name": "Time 'n' Space", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2007": "Pick-up and Deliver"}, "age": "10", "usersrated": "448", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "average": "6.3834"}, "137239": {"rpgitemversion": {"197684": "Rich Text Format version (RTF)"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "LowDie System Core Rules", "rpgproducer": {"57685": "Robert Grant Erswell"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpg": {"21466": "LowDie System"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "rpggenre": {"173": "Generic / Universal"}, "description": "from the website:<br/>A generic roleplaying engine<br/><br/>The LowDie system is designed to be a generic roleplaying game &quot;engine&quot; that minimises dice rolls, mental arithmetic, and complicated derived statistics to speed play up and allow the players to focus on the story being told.

But some of them will be so popular that only a die duel can decide who gets to wear them!<br/><br/>Components: The game consists of 24 catwalk cards, 12 Miss Magix cards and a die (apply stickers before first game).<br/><br/>Summary and aim of the game: Each round, players try to win as many catwalk cards as possible by using one of their Miss Magix cards. If more than one player wants the same catwalk cards, there is a die duel. The player who owns the most catwalk cards at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>Gameplay: The 24 catwalk cards are shuffled and put in a face-down stack. Each player gets one Miss Magix card per colour (orange, pink, turquoise). <br/>The game is played in several rounds. <br/>At the start of a round, four catwalk cards are placed next to each other, face up. If cards are left over from the previous round, fill up to a total of four. <br/>Then, each player chooses one of their three Miss Magix cards and puts it down, face down. The colour of the Miss Magix card shows which catwalk card(s) you want to gain this round (i.e. if you put down an orange Miss Magix card, you are going for the orange catwalk card(s)). <br/>Players then turn over their Miss Magix cards simultaneously. If you are the only one to have chosen a particular colour, you immediately win that card. Players who were going for the same colour compete in a die duel.<br/>The die duel: All players taking part in a duel. Players take turns rolling the die. A star symbol means that the player stays in the duel, the Winx logo means the player is out of the duel, and a player who rolls the heart symbol isn't just out of the duel but can't use his/her currently used Miss Magix card in the next round (i.e. he/she only has two cards to choose from during that round). A duel ends when all participating players have rolled at least once per die rolling round and there is either only one player left (then he/she gets to take the catwalk cards the duel was about) or all duel participants are out (then neither of them gets to take the cards, they stay out for the next round).<br/>The game ends when the stack with the catwalk cards has been used up.

After three rounds, if they have collected more magic chips than the Trix, they all win together and the player with the most magic chips is awarded for being the most courageous fairy.<br/><br/>Setup: The 23 path tiles are laid out to create the course to Alfea.

The 48 flight chips are shuffled and placed at the center of the table. Each player draws three flight chips and puts them down in front of him/herself, face down.<br/><br/>Gameplay: The game is played in three rounds.

At the start of the game, everyone knows who Renfeld is, and Renfield knows which of the hunters is actually a vampire (as he chooses how to distribute the character cards), but the vampire's identity is hidden from everyone else. The hunters must identify the vampire and kill him with the ancestral stake before he can play five bite cards; if the hunters accidentally stake one of their own, then demoralized and weakened they lose the game.<br/><br/>Each player other than Renfield starts with two cards from the library, which is comprised of rumors, incantations, bites and night cards. Five ritual cards &ndash; silver mirror, 2x blood transfusion, holy water and time distortion &ndash; are placed face-up on the table. Renfield creates a &quot;clock&quot; by taking one night card for each player and shuffling it with a dawn card.<br/><br/>The game lasts a number of rounds, with the rounds continuing until one of the winning conditions is met. At the start of a round, players take turns doing the following: Drawing two cards from the library, discarding one card face-up, placing one card face-down in an action pile, then drawing a card from the clock. As soon as a player draws the dawn card or each player has played once, this part of the round ends.<br/><br/>Renfield shuffles all the cards in the action pile, then reveals them. If the pile contains only incantations, the player holding the stake chooses one of the rituals, takes its action, then turns the ritual face-down. Once all five rituals have been used, the hunters win the game, but their main goal is to kill the vampire. If the deck contains bite cards, then Renfield applies the bites to the hunters, with a hunter losing one card in his stock for each bite; a hunter can have at most two bites. Night cards in the pile are added to the clock, thereby giving the vampire more time to work in future rounds, while making it tougher for players to achieve rituals.<br/><br/>If the dawn card was revealed, the holder of the ancient stake can stab someone, thereby ending the game with victory for one side or the other, or pass the stake to another player.

Coins are combined (vertically and/or horizontally) to form higher valued coins; for example, five '1' coins will form a '5' coin, and two '5' coins will form a '10' coin, and so on, until two '500' coins are put together, at which point both disappear. Coins are arranged and colored to match denominations of the yen coins. Two bonus tiles allow for changes in gameplay. A green RU tile will rank up all coins of the same denomination; for example, all '10' coins will become '50' coins. A blue ER title will erase all coins of the same value. The game is won when any coin reaches the bottom of the opponent's screen.<br/><br/>In the single player mode, one of two characters can be selected who attempt to beat up to seven idiosyncratically named characters with names like Debtmiser, Mightdealer, Eldylabor, and Cherrybeiter. In the two player mode, both players fight each other until victory. The quicker and more efficiently each player clears out their screen, the quicker the other player's screen will fill up. Since filled screens offer the most opportunity for chaining together large combos, the tide can turn very quickly.<br/><br/>There is also another single player mode called Solo Mode. Any character can be played in this mode. The aim in Solo Mode is to continually clear the screen from coins and try to keep the game going for as long as possible.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Money Idol Exchanger&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "137306": {"rpgitemversion": {"197822": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Player Quick Reference Sheets", "rpgproducer": {"41310": "Patrick Bryant"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1548739.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"1588": "Baba Yaga: The Secret War"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1548739_t.jpg", "description": "Cover blurb:<br/><br/>Player Quick Reference Sheets:<br/>Character Sheet, Skill Rolls and Wounds, Combat Basics,<br/>Common Weapon Statistics, Players Guide, Partisan Rules of Thumb,<br/>Military Skills, and Sample Magical Effects.<br/><br/>"}, "137307": {"boardgamedesigner": {"39478": {"name": "Ian Millington"}}, "average": "7.77273", "poll": {}, "name": "Dicecards", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "22", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1561282_t.png", "boardgameartist": {"39478": "Ian Millington"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1561282.png", "boardgameversion": {"198182": "English Bespoke Service Black-Backed First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Dicecards are a new geektastic take on generating random stuff for games.

To collect treasure you'll need to sail the high seas, avoiding rival pirates, following treasure maps, and finding keys to unlock the treasure chests.

During a scene, a player may play one of her character&rsquo;s cards to carry out some action in the game. When playing a card, the character declares which attribute the card is being played for.

A stadium announcer was added and the game's interface had a new updated look. The game play had been much improved, especially the control of the on-field action. In the past, the control had issues with responsiveness to the point that many had opted to simply call plays and allowed the computer to control the action on the field. Despite the efforts of Sierra Entertainment to improve upon these many areas, the graphics and audio aspects of the game were inferior to the Madden NFL franchise.<br/><br/>To further compound the problems, NFL Football Pro '99 was rushed to release to meet the 1998 holiday rush in a completely unplayable state. Sierra briefly considered patching the game but then decided to abandon the series entirely in January 1999. A recall notice was issued for the game by Sierra Entertainment on January 21, 1999, and the game was pulled from the shelves.[2] Lingering attachment to the series caused a few hard-core fans to attempt to fix the game on their own, but many turned their attention back to the 95 or 96 games (both of which are still played in online leagues today.)<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Front Page Sports Football&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "137330": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1548855.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"16265": {"name": "Oliver Sibthorpe"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"14748": "Jonathan Kirtz"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"108": {"name": "Gamewright"}}, "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1548855_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"21793": "2011 UK Games Expo Best Family/Children's Game Winner"}, "description": "Cube Quest is a dexterity game in which lightweight hollow cubic dice are flicked across custom rubber mats.

Board Game lets fans play as their favorite secret agent or staffer and compete against other players. The object of the game is to gain the Upper Hand over your opponents by insulting them, doing well on missions (quite the ego boost), and encountering random guest stars and secondary characters from the show. Each player starts with five Upper Hand, and the first player to have 20 Upper Hand wins.<br/><br/>Each player chooses one of the following characters to play: Archer, Lana, Malory, Cyril, Pam, Cheryl, Ray or Dr. Krieger. The insults and dirty tricks you deliver to the other players are based on actual quotes from the show that your character makes. The cards in your unique deck of twenty cards give you the ability to hurl insults, &quot;come on&quot; to another character, or say something that builds up your character's own ego. Naturally you'll have plenty of opportunities to belittle your co-workers while in the office and out in the field. Doing so will knock them down a peg or two on the Upper Hand track.<br/><br/>The action takes place at the ISIS Headquarters, though spy missions send the gang off to exotic locales each round of play. The game features six important office locations within ISIS, but you (typically) play with around four of them, making each game play out very differently since the &quot;Office Map&quot; varies from game to game. Each location does something different, but only the first person to go to each location each round gets the benefit listed on that location.

On a turn, the active player discards a card that matches either in number or color the card on top of the discard pile.

Four types of violet cards can be played on top of anything, and they either give you another turn immediately, force everyone to draw one card, force your left- and right-hand to race for the buzzer (with the slower player drawing a card as a penalty), or force everyone to race for the buzzer!<br/><br/>Empty your hand first, and you win a chip. The first player to collect three chips wins the game.<br/><br/>A variant for masochists or those who just like to buzz a lot has you paying attention to the back of the cards as well, as each back features 1-4 colored buttons that match the colors of the main suits. After a person draws a card, if one of the buttons on the newly revealed card matches the color of the top card on the discard pile, players must race to hit the buzzer, with the last player to do so drawing a penalty card.<br/><br/>Reimplements<br/><br/><br/>     Crazy Eights<br/><br/><br/>"}, "137359": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Adventure Quarterly (Issue 3 - Jan 2013)", "rpgproducer": {"29582": "Robert N.

Why not go counter-clockwise and travel only one space instead of seven? Because you have the brain of a crab and cannot reason that well.<br/><br/>To set up the game, you assemble the octopus, which has alternating high and low legs, place all the crabs to the right of the bandaged leg (when looking from above), place the starfish to the left of this leg, and place the shark opposite the crabs.<br/><br/>On a turn, you roll the two dice. If both dice show numbers, you can move one of your crabs ahead the sum of the two numbers or you can move each crab forward equal to the number on one die. To move, you must push the crabs gently under the arms of the octopus, not disturbing Jolly O in any way. If the other players do spot movement, then you return the crab to its starting location and lose the movement points for that action. If one of the dice shows a shark fin, you move one crab forward equal to the number on the other die, then move the shark clockwise that same number of spaces.

It is the sequel to the critically acclaimed 2006 game Company of Heroes.<br/><br/>As with the original Company of Heroes, the game is set in World War II but the focus is on the Eastern Front. Company of Heroes 2 runs on Relic Entertainment's proprietary Essence 3.0 game engine, which THQ claims allowed the developer to bring &quot;new technological advancements&quot; to the game. In January 2013, Sega acquired Relic Entertainment and along with it the Company of Heroes intellectual property from THQ. The game was released on June 25, 2013 in North America and Europe.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The game features the Soviet Red Army as a new faction and takes the player to various stages of the Eastern Front campaign, from Operation Barbarossa to the Battle of Berlin. The game is built on Relic's proprietary Essence 3.0 engine, which showcases new improvements compared to Relic's previous games. One such improvement is the new line-of-sight technology, TrueSight, which aims to better emulate troop visibility in real combat. In contrast to traditional unit visibility, TrueSight more accurately represents a unit's visibility range based on environmental conditions and type of unit. Essence 3.0 also incorporates an innovative weather-simulating technology known as ColdTech and destructible environments.<br/><br/>Weather conditions are a major factor in gameplay, with movement and action penalties applied on players' units. Since many battles in the Eastern Front occurred in winter weather, troops can die of frostbite if caught in the outside during blizzards (a bright blue bar will denote how close they are to succumbing from the cold). Bonfires protect soldiers from the cold at the expense of enemy detection, buildings will also help player units preserve their body heat. Players moving through deep snow will move at a reduced speed. Certain maps have frozen bodies of water, allowing for more movement options. However, players face the danger of being attacked from the other side; as a result, the ice can buckle under the weight of the units in movement.<br/><br/>Company of Heroes 2 takes advantage of DirectX 11 but also supports DirectX 9. The game also utilizes Valve's Steamworks technology with matchmaking and achievements.[9] In regards to strategy mechanics, the game retains the traditional Company of Heroes formula.<br/><br/>The game introduces the &quot;Theater of War,&quot; a series of single-player and cooperative missions detailing various aspects of the Eastern Front campaign from both German and Soviet sides. Eighteen missions set in 1941 will be part of the game upon release with the missions from 1942 onwards available as downloadable content. Game developer Quinn Duffy said the rich history of World War II on the Eastern Front is an opportunity to show other stories from the war. The game also offers the player a chance to complete side quests in a mission such as protecting civilians caught in the crossfire. Players can also commandeer abandoned vehicles.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Company of Heroes 2&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "137385": {"poll": {}, "name": "So ein Durcheinander!", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2060": "Pattern Recognition"}, "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"5860": "TV Series: Spongebob Squarepants"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1551172_t.jpg", "average": "4", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"34": {"name": "Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1551172.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"197962": "Ravensburger First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "A game in the range of 'minis' by Ravensburger.<br/><br/>There are five tiles and each tile has a different assortment of five colours along each edge.

Each player can use the different members of the abbey to help them hide the treasures &ndash; but every character is different and needs to be used wisely. Whoever hides the most treasures wins!<br/><br/>Each player has a hand of ten character cards and a starting supply of treasure: one book, one chalice, and a handful of signet rings that come in three types. A harbor with six storehouses is stocked with additional treasures, and three characters &ndash; Abbot Remigius, Vitus, and Prior Severus &ndash; are placed in the 13-room abbey.<br/><br/>For the first round of the game, each player secretly chooses a character card, then they all reveal them simultaneously, with players then carrying out the actions on those cards in player order. Some characters represent monks who help you move through the abbey and hide treasure, others allow you to take treasure from the harbor, open a locked door while closing off another passage, or move treasure that another player has already stashed, among other things. When a player moves Abbot Remigius, the Abbot rewards all players who have stashed treasure in the room in which he ends his movement, with all of the treasure then being marked as scored &ndash; other than duplicate signet rings, which can score again should the Abbot return. (Vitus, who isn't controlled by a card, follows the Abbot closely to spy upon him, thus keeping the Abbot from returning to the most recent room he entered.) If the Prior Severus is in a room, though, the Abbot can't do his thing as Severus would then discover the treasure and learn of the Knights' actions.<br/><br/>After the initial round, a player must play a character card that doesn't match the top character card on any player's discard pile &ndash; which means that you (and others) play both offense and defense with the same character card, restricting the action of others while ideally making good use of the character yourself. When a player lays down The Bells card, he picks up all of his played cards, then restocks the harbor based on the number of his previously played character card.<br/><br/>When the harbor can no longer be filled properly or when a player has placed at least one treasure in each room, the final round is triggered, then players have a final scoring for their rings still in the abbey and for the number of rooms that hold their treasure.

The stakes are unlimited by anything except the players&rsquo; inclination or ability to pay.<br/>RULES OF PLAY<br/>1    The players take it in turn to throw both dice. The player with the higher score becomes Cat; the other, Mouse. They put the agreed stakes in the pots: Cat in her Kattepot on red 66 and Mouse in his Muizepot on black 66. Cat moves to the top left-hand corner of the board and Mouse to the bottom right.<br/>2    Cat begins the game by throwing both dice and preparing to move her counter along the Cat Walk - the red numbered squares - to square 3 if the dice show 2 and 1, square 4 if they show 3 and 1, square 5 if they show 2 and 3 or 4 and 1, and so on. If Cat throws a double 1 she moves to square 11, in which case Mouse must pay her two chips. If she throws a double 6 she pays two chips to Mouse and does not move. If she lands on 5 she loses her next turn, but if she lands on 10 she may throw again; if she lands on 4 or 9 she pays one chip to Mouse.<br/>3    Mouse now throws and moves in the same way down the Mouse Run - the black numbered squares - paying or receiving the same number of chips.<br/>4    Cat&rsquo;s turn again, and the same rules apply. But there are more: if Cat has to jump her counter over Mouse&rsquo;s, she pays him one chip; if she lands on square 15 she loses her next turn; square 20 gives her a second throw; and 16 means another chip paid to Mouse. If she is already past square 11 by this turn, a double 2 will take her to square 22 - otherwise it is only the total 4 that counts. If she lands on square 22, Mouse must pay her two chips.<br/>5    Mouse follows Cat, and Cat then follows Mouse again, each racing for the other&rsquo;s pot on square 66. The earlier rules still apply: landing on 22, 33,44 or 55 earns two chips; once past 22 a double 3 leads straight to square 33, and once past 33 two 4s lead to 44 and past that two 5s to 55. Once past 55 a double six is a passport straight to the pot. Before that a double 6 still means a lost turn and a forfeit of two chips to the other player. Landing on squares 25,35,45 or 65 means a lost turn, while achieving squares 30, 40, 50 or 60 gains a second throw; stopping on 25, 36, 49 or 64 entails paying over one chip to the other player.<br/>6    If Cat or Mouse throws a total which will take him or her beyond square 66, he or she has to turn back to 48. But the player who reaches 66 first WINS the game and takes both stakes.<br/><br/>The pictures on the board are taken from the works of three leading illustrators: the English artists Alfred Elwes and Harrison Weir, and the American Palmer Cox.<br/><br/>"}, "137445": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The New Adventures of Mary-Kate & Ashley", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"198099": "North American Game Boy Color edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2468": "Children's"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "videogameplatform": {"4424": "Game Boy Color"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Help Mary-Kate, Ashley, and their dog clue get through the levels and solve the mysteries.

The speed is converted into number of boards which their cars can pass by - every 30 kmph is one board. Maximum speed is 270 kmph.<br/><br/>When safe speed for the curve is exceeded, the player has to roll the dice specified number of times to check if the car would stay on the track after breaking or if the accident (and some additional damage to the tyres and brakes) would happen.<br/><br/>The players are equipped with some amount of tyres and brakes points (represented by cards), which are used during the game when players brake hard to indicate the tyres and brakes wear.<br/><br/>Both types of damage points could be reset to the amount from the beggining of the game in the pit stop during the race.<br/><br/>During the race players can also use tactical cards.

Lovecraft's weird fiction. The museum harbors artifacts that draw the attention of horrible beings, and the unfathomable wills of these creatures make themselves known in the form of blessings and curses. Four new Ancient Ones, eight new investigators, and several new monsters accompany the introduction of these powers, and the entrance of the museum has been remodeled thanks to four Entrance Cards, which give investigators more ways to spend their turn if they'd rather not attempt an adventure.<br/><br/>Blessings and curses work their power in Unseen Forces through the introduction of a white and a black die. A blessed investigator gains the Blessed card and adds a white die to the player's dice pool, giving him an extra icon to use to complete his tasks. Being cursed forces a player to take the Cursed card and roll the black die along with the rest of his dice pool. If the player rolls any die that matches the result on the black die, he must discard both from his pool immediately.<br/><br/>Blessings and curses don't keep building up on an investigator. Any blessed character who receives a second blessing can draw a spell card, a clue, or a common or a unique item card. Cursed investigators, on the other hand, are walking a very fine line. If an investigator has the misfortune of a second curse being inflicted, he is immediately devoured!

However, it left them in possession of the strategically important Halfaya Pass, the gateway to Egypt. In addition, British forces were harassing the German defenders with mobile columns to the South. German General Rommel recognized the need to recapture this terrain in order to stabilize the front. Still fearing the British infantry tank, Matilda, an under gunned, ponderous, mobile fortification, Rommel launched three panzer battalions plus supporting units to sweep the British from the field. The offensive was code named, &quot;Unternehmen Skorpion,&quot; ultimately known to the Allies as Operation Skorpion. The battle was brief and violent. Although there was a significant disparity in firepower, the Germans had a definite Achilles heel. Can the Germans accomplish their goals of capturing the Halfaya Pass and clearing its southern approaches before their supplies are exhausted, particularly the remainder of their fuel allotment?<br/><br/>Operation Skorpion is a relatively short, fast moving game that introduces a new fog of war game system. Opposing strength is unknown until units enter combat. Once revealed, those combat values can continue to fluctuate during the course of the game based on judicious use of mobile supply units, which can distribute and absorb Allocation Points. Although fighting a defensive battle, the British Player is not without counterattack capability. He will find his artillery arm, both direct and indirect fire, to be a potent force. Game rules such as: Combined Arms, HQ Coordinated Combat, Road Overrun, Engineers, and Reconnaissance Probe, all contribute to an appropriate sense of realism. Operation Skorpion provides exciting, tense, and balanced game play. Determining the ultimate winner often occurs on the last or next-to-the last game-turn. Turn back the clock to the heady days of Spring 1941 and command the Afrika Korps, or take on the British and ultimately break the sword of the Desert Fox, himself, in this battle game by Compass Games.<br/><br/>"}, "137498": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1559499.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"226997": "South China Sea"}, "is_expanded_by": {"180577": {"name": "Breaking the Chains: Supplements"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"11876": {"name": "John Gorkowski"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"11856": "Mark Mahaffey"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3929": {"name": "Compass Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1559499_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1069": {"name": "Modern Warfare"}}, "description": "publisher's description<br/><br/>Breaking the Chains (BtC) simulates a hypothetical future military conflict over the South China and East China Seas around the year 2021. Conflicting claims of sovereignty have roiled those &quot;near seas&quot; since the Cold War. After decades of patient diplomacy, Beijing's new navy could offer military options for finally asserting sovereignty over prizes within the First Island Chain - that string of islands which runs from the Ryukus south through Taiwan, the Philippines and then curls back to the mainland via Malaysia. BtC presumes that China comes to blows with a Southeast Asian country in a conflict that could expand to possibly include: Australia, India, Japan, the United States as well as a variety of Southeast Asian nations. However, beyond China and one South East Asian nation, the exact composition of opposing coalitions is not predetermined but rather a function of the decisions players make as the game unfolds.<br/><br/>Two or more people play BtC with two reference cards, dice, and about 350 counters on a 22&quot; X 34&quot; map where each hex spans about 70 nautical miles (80 land miles) and each turn represents one day of real time. Players alternate maneuvering air, ground and naval units for up to 14 nations to resolve battles with a universal &quot;strike&quot; mechanism that applies across all types of combat; missile defense capabilities are central to survival. Air units represent from 30-90 aircraft each, most ground units are regiments, and naval units are small groups of surface ships/submarines or individual aircraft carriers. Specialized chit play simulates black ops, cyber warfare and various political developments.<br/><br/>BtC is solitaire friendly. The naval operations which dominate play are based on a roll-to-evade model rather than search-to-find model. That means, owing to a battle space awash in electromagnetic emissions, enemy positions - except for motionless submarines - are assumed to be known unless a last-minute dice roll determines a potential target has evaded detection. So there is no &acirc;\u0080\u009chidden movement&acirc;\u0080\u009d to stifle solitaire play; and the &acirc;\u0080\u009chidden placement&acirc;\u0080\u009d of submarines can be forgone.

Under the control of a skilled operator the Predator can penetrate enemy territory and gather intelligence, avoiding detection by hostile forces, relaying real-time data to the Ground Control Station. In a shadowy world where there are no second chances, the fate of nations is determined by the deadly spy in the sky.<br/><br/>In a revolutionary breakthrough for Flight Simulator the Predator UAV is at your disposal and can be operated from the Ground Control station, utilising electronic display screens to guide the UAV to its target. Alternatively, take direct hands-on control of the Predator utilising a custom camera view that puts you in the thick of the action.<br/><br/>Command airborne operations where the risk is too great to deploy a manned aircraft. A raft of missions for Flight Simulator X puts you in the hotseat where mission success depends on split second decision making and absolute accuracy in handling the UAV. Flying the Predator across mountain ranges and at high speed through narrow canyons demands an operator with nerves of steel and a will of iron in pursuit of the target. Battle through the snows of the Arctic in search of a downed spy satellite, trying to keep one step ahead of the opposition in a frantic search to recover data vital to Allied interests. Pit your wits against ruthless terrorists in a tropical archipelago or race against the clock in a dramatic game of hide and seek across continental Europe and much much more.<br/><br/>The Predator demands the finest operator, adept at deploying the aircraft on vital missions across the globe.

The stated goal of the project is to recreate Valve's critically acclaimed 1998 video game Half-Life using the more advanced capabilities of the Source engine. The 40-person volunteer development team says they hope to create a more engrossing in-game world with more varied, complex environments and more challenging, realistic gameplay.<br/><br/>During its eight years in development, Black Mesa has been featured in several video game publications and received direct attention from Valve. Due to its long development time the modification became notable for its delays, and dwindling updates on the status of its completion. The delays led to Wired awarding Black Mesa high spots on their &quot;Vaporware Of The Year&quot; lists in 2009 and 2010.<br/><br/>The first part of Black Mesa, featuring remakes of all Half-Life's chapters except those set on the alien world &quot;Xen&quot;, was released as a standalone download on September 14, 2012. Public voting through Valve's Greenlight program saw the game approved for distribution on Steam.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>Black Mesa is a first-person shooter that requires the player to perform combat tasks and puzzle solving to advance through the game. The core gameplay remains unchanged from the original Half-Life; the player can carry a number of weapons that they find through the course of the game, though must also locate ammo for most weapons. The player's character is protected by a hazard suit that monitors the player's health and can be charged as a shield, absorbing a limited amount of damage. Health and shield packs can be found scattered through the game, as well as stations that can recharge both.<br/><br/>The primary difference in gameplay from the original Half-Life is the ability to use the Source engine's physics to influence gameplay elements. The original Half-Life engine based on the GoldSrc engine, lacked such physics, with certain events or situations instead hard-coded as animations, such as a toppling stack of boxes. With the Source engine, these physical effects can be handled directly by the engine, allowing the player to initiate such actions to their advantage, or to make certain challenges more difficult such as jumping across a number of crates suspended by cable from a conveyor system.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Black Mesa (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "137100": {"boardgamedesigner": {"66285": {"name": "Motoyuki Fushimi"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Gekitoh Tabaruzaka", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2057": "Chit-Pull System"}, "yearpublished": "1991", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1641521_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1391": {"name": "Hobby Japan"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1641521.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"197316": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1102": {"name": "Civil War"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Operational level wargame for the battle of Tabaruzaka in Satsuma Rebellion.

Unlike the earlier Strike Fighters Android, which solely featured jet aircraft, you start this game with three propeller driven piston engine fighters. The 1948 aircraft are an unlocked Israeli Spitfire Mk.IX, a locked Egyptian Spitfire and a locked Israeli P-51D Mustang.<br/><br/>As with the prior game in the Strike Fighters series, the capabilities of your aircraft will improve as you progress through the Israel 1948-82 campaign. Starting with aircraft armed with guns, you will soon transition to jets equipped with early (and unreliable) heat seeking air-to-air missiles. That is followed by the addition of radar guided missiles, and later defensive countermeasures. In addition, during the 1960s, some jets are only armed with a small number of missiles and no gun. This accurately reflects the time period during which some &quot;experts&quot; theorized that the combination of high speeds and guided missiles would negate the need for guns and dogfighting.<br/><br/>Every time you kill 5 planes, time advances 1 year and you get keys to unlock one or more new planes which may offer more advanced technology, longer play times or different weapons loadouts. Strike Fighters Israel also provides additional unlock keys in the years 1956, 1967, 1973, and 1982. While you can purchase more modern aircraft before playing through to the year that they are unlocked in the campaign, all planes can be unlocked for free through continued successful play. In addition, missions flown with aircraft that are later than the current campaign year do not count towards your advancement.<br/><br/>"}, "137103": {"poll": {}, "name": "Reise durch 5 Erdteile", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2299455_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2008": {"name": "Abel Klinger"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2299455.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"197322": "First edition 1946"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Objective:<br/>be the first finishing your round trip<br/> - moving by turns -<br/>Each player chooses her/his own (coloured) route:<br/>simple 'roll &amp; move' game; ending on a marked space follow instructions printed on lid inside.<br/><br/>remarks: <br/>published during 1950's - plastic (painted) meeples:<br/>republished 1960's as 'Reise durch die Welt' - but rules and board stayed unchanged (old title); facts (like inhabitants...) are related to the 50's.<br/><br/>"}, "137104": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1550039.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"54146": {"name": "Louis Malz"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"52259": "Marko Fiedler"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"47": {"name": "Queen Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1550039_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "description": "Edo: Expansion #1 expands the Edo base game with three new modules &ndash; Jiin, Tokken, and Ronin &ndash; and each module can be used individually or combined with other modules.

It was released only in Japan on December 18, 1986. It was also rereleased for the two-in-one PlayStation game, Memorial Series SunSoft Vol. 3, which also has T\u014dkaid\u014d Goj\u016bsan-tsugi, another SunSoft game. The Wing of Madoola resembles the OVA titled Leda: The Fantastic Adventure of Yohko (\u5e7b\u5922\u6226\u8a18\u30ec\u30c0 Genmu Senki Leda?). In fact, the OVA was popular back when the game was being developed and released.<br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>Once upon a time, in the Kingdom of Badham, there was a statue of a bird known as the Wing of Madoola. Whoever possessed the wing would possess the power to rule the world, and many wars were fought between nations to obtain it. A wise king, one of the members of the Rameru family, managed to get a hold of the wing, and ordered that a deep cave be constructed where the wings would be hidden so that the wars would cease. The knowledge of the cave would be recorded and locked away, accessible only to the rulers of the land. Peace soon returned to the world.<br/><br/>Several centuries later, a young member of the Rameru family known as Darutos learned of the location of the wing through the kingdom's secret archives. He betrayed the family and stole away with the Wing of Madoola. Using the power of the wing, he summoned demons to attack and take over castle Arekusu. He constructed an underground labyrinth beneath the castle, built a dangerous fortress, and planned to rule the world.The few survivors of Arekusu's military, and the remainder of the Rameru family fled the castle. They regrouped and devised a desperate plan to overthrow Darutos and regain control of the kingdom. Lucia, a brave warrior, was selected to accompany a member of the Rameru family who was uniquely capable of wielding magic known only to his family.<br/><br/>As they approached Arekusu, they were beset upon by two powerful demons. While one distracted Lucia, the other attacked the Rameru family member. Lucia battled both demons and defeated them, but not before her partner received a fatal wound. Knowing what had to be done, Lucia bravely pressed forward, knowing that only she could stop Darutos, and regain possession of the Wing of Madoola.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The game's genre is a side scrolling action adventure game. The player must progress through 16 stages, collecting items which increase the main character Lucia's power, while defeating the boss of each stage in order to gain entrance to the next stage. This game is considered to be difficult to beat. Although Lucia's strength and health increase throughout the game, enemies generally do large amounts of damage, and many continue to smash into Lucia for multiple consecutive hits. Some stages are very large, and it is easy to overlook some of the more necessary items that can make the completion of the game much easier. Many of the bosses can withstand a tremendous amount of damage before being defeated.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The Wing of Madoola&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "137113": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (DS)", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"197362": "North American Nintendo DS edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"5474": "Harry Potter Movies"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "videogamegenre": {"2161": "Action Adventure"}, "videogamefranchise": {"6172": "Harry Potter"}, "videogameplatform": {"4734": "Nintendo DS"}, "usersrated": "0", "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 for the DS is a action adventure game that closes follows the movie of the same name.

Whoever is first to reach five of his/her wonders and takes a picture of them wins the game.<br/><br/>Setup: Each of the five balloon pieces is put on the corresponding starting point of the board. Each player gets three Willi chips, three compasses and three pips to go with the compasses. The cards are shuffled and each player gets a hand of five cards. Players only see their own cards. The remaining cards form the draw deck.<br/><br/>Gameplay: The game is played in several rounds, and each round consists of several legs: rolling the colour die to select a balloon for the round (all players move the same balloon during a round), discarding a card and drawing a new one (optional), choosing directions by marking them with the pip on their compasses, and moving the balloons on the board according to the directions on the compasses. If the balloon lands on a space that shows a wonder that is depicted on a player's card, he/she &quot;takes a picture&quot; (says &quot;Click!&quot; and reads the information about the wonder from his/her card) and draws a new card.<br/><br/>Balloon movement in more detail: Balloon movement is done in three stages per round. First, the start player chooses one of his/her three compasses, then the next player etc. until all players have resolved all their three compasses. A player may choose not to move the balloon if they don't want to use a particular direction on one of their compasses, but they may not use that compass again in the same round.<br/>Spaces occupied by another balloon or a Willi chip (put on a space that the balloon leaves) are skipped. If a balloon reaches the edge of the board in north or south direction, no further movement in that direction is possible; the eastern and western edges of the map allow crossing over to the other side.<br/><br/>"}, "137127": {"rpgitemversion": {"197404": "Edition Szenario"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Idee!

In addition to Gold Coin cards, the action cards in the game each have up to three effects: Ability, Activate, and/or Reaction.

On another player's turn, players may play a card with a Reaction effect to counter an opponent's card. In addition to these three actions, during their turns, players may move Gold Coin cards around within their play areas (placing a Gold Coin card on top of a Coin Purse card for protection, for example).<br/><br/>Example cards include Dagger, Cutpurse, Pickpocket, Lock Box, Guild Hall, Traveling Merchant, Lock Pick, Thieves' Tools, and the Dirty Thief.<br/><br/>Using these and other cards' Abilities, Activates, and Reactions, players both seek to steal the Gold Coin cards from their opponents--adding them to their play area--and protect their own Gold Coin cards from being stolen.
