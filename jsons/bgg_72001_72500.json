The game takes an unusual approach at the genre, by using elements most commonly associated with console video games, such as the Final Fantasy series. Septerra Core's art style draws most of its inspiration from the Japanese anime genre, making use of stylised characters and fantastic landscape, combining science fiction futuristic elements with, for example, medieval concepts. That is essentially made possible because the game is set on a fictional world composed by seven analogous layers - hence the title &quot;Septerra&quot;, from the Latin &quot;sept&quot;, seven, and &quot;terra&quot;, earth - each with unique characteristics, geography and political structure. Battles in Septerra Core implement a variant of Active Time Battle, with the only substantial difference being that the strength of the character's attacks are defined by how long the player allows the time gauge of said character to be charged. Other notable features include fully recorded dialogue, CGI cutscenes and a flexible magic system based on cards similar to those of Tarot. Professional voice actors supplied the voices for the main characters while Valkyrie employees and friends voiced the minor characters.<br/><br/>In the center of Septerra lies the Core, a giant Biocomputer.

It features comedy elements and was developed by Revolution Software and published by Virgin Interactive Entertainment. It was initially released for DOS and Amiga. Its working title was Underworld.<br/><br/>The game takes place at an unknown point in a dystopian future in Australia, where the Earth has been significantly damaged by pollution or nuclear fallout. The game's backstory is introduced via a comic book, drawn by well-known comic artist Dave Gibbons, that tells the story of a young boy called Robert who is the sole survivor of a plane crash in &quot;the Gap&quot; (the name applied to the Australian Outback at the time of the game). Too young to fend for himself, Robert is adopted by a local group of Indigenous Australians, who teach him the skills he needs to survive in this harsh new environment; they name him Robert Foster, partly due to him being fostered by them and also because of the discovery of an empty can of Foster's Lager, an Australian beer, found near him at the crash site. Foster even learns engineering and technology and builds a talking, sentient robot called Joey.<br/><br/>After Foster has reached adulthood, he is kidnapped and his tribe annihilated by storm-troopers sent from Union City by its all-powerful computer LINC. Interestingly, Union City mentions prominent suburbs and train stations found within Australia's largest city, Sydney, leading some to speculate that Union City was once Sydney. This was confirmed in a 2005 interview with the Australian gaming magazine, PC PowerPlay.<br/><br/>Foster manages to escape from his captors as the helicopter transporting him back to Union City crashes just after entering the dome, leaving him and his robot friend, Joey, to find out why they were brought there and where to go next, while security continues to search for him.<br/><br/>Joey's personality is stored on a small circuit board, which can easily be inserted and removed from many types of robot bodies. This allows Joey to change bodies as the situation requires, provided his circuit board is not damaged. Joey, however, is not always happy about Foster's choice of body for him.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Beneath_a_Steel_Sky,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "72014": {"poll": [], "name": "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/UK DOS edition", "Macintosh Downloadable edition", "US DOS edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic904820.png", "videogametheme": ["Cyberpunk", "Moral Choices"], "usersrated": "24", "videogamedeveloper": ["Cyberdreams", "The Dreamers Guild"], "videogamegenre": ["Point-and-Click"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS", "Macintosh", "Windows"], "average": "7.29375", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Acclaim Entertainment Inc.", "Cyberdreams", "Night Dive Studios"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic904820_t.png", "description": "&quot;I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is an adventure game based upon Harlan Ellison's short story of the same name.

When a key is held down a gauge at the bottom of the screen begins to fill up. When the key is released, Bugaboo will jump in that direction, with the strength of the jump being determined by how long the key was held down. The cavern is made up of various rocky ledges which Bugaboo may land on; however he can only stand on a flat area and, if a jump is mistimed, Bugaboo may end up on an angled area of rock, or miss the ledge altogether, which will cause him to fall straight down, landing on whatever is below.<br/><br/>Bugaboo may fall from any distance without dying. The only way for the player to lose a life is for Bugaboo to make contact with the large, yellow dragon which appears periodically.

It is a hybrid between first- and third-person shooter with an emphasis on teamwork and puzzle solving over combat. Players switch between control of four UPA (Urban Protection Agency) agents, each with their own special abilities, as they work their way through a city that has grown upward and upward, leaving delving buildings and neighborhoods &quot;below city limits.&quot;. Among other unique mechanics of Project Eden is the fact that player characters don't die; instead, they are respawned at the last checkpoint, where their health is fully restored. With its emphasis on puzzle-solving over combat, the game may be thought of as a cyberpunk updating of The Lost Vikings, as it has more in common with that game developed by Blizzard Entertainment than traditional first- or third-person shooters. A single player can control any of the four characters at any given time, and other players can jump in at any time and assume control of team members.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Project_Eden,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "72019": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic733904.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Mark Facey", "Alejandro Guti\u00e9rrez", "Jeff Haas", "Peter Lazarski", "Stanley W.

Faster pace. With 2 resources acquired per term (most every other CCG is 1) plus the ability to barter 1 resource and acquire a third resource each term, every term is exciting and brings new twists into the fray. Never suffer through another, &quot;Draw a land. My turn is over&quot; term again.<br/><br/>2. Multi-region system. With 4 location regions per commander and a central battlefield region, you have far more options and therefore strategy is kicker. Like in a game of chess, in Conquest you need to think about positioning for your units. In most card games, it's simply your army vs. your opponent's army, 2 regions, and whether to attack or defend is a very simple matter of arithmetic.<br/><br/>3. Various strategies to pursue. Because locations and upgrades, commanders' sources of income, are vulnerable to attack and destruction, commanders have more options for how to seek a victory--a straight out offensive on the enemy domain to flat-out win or a more subtle wearing down of the opponent's income. Also, with 2 types of income (gold and mana), you can try to isolate one of these sources to cripple the opponent's army.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Self-Published Edition"], "age": "12", "name": "Conquest of Arthenia", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management"], "average": "4.5", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["CCGs (Collectible Card Games)"]}, "72021": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jussi Wallenius"], "poll": [], "name": "Spider-Man", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Point to Point Movement", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "1996", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Comics: Marvel Universe"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic731512_t.jpg", "average": "4.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Tactic"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic731512.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Comic Book / Strip"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "From the Publishers website:<br/>When Peter Parker, bitten by radioactive spider, he received a spider's relative speed, force and movement.

The game follows the adventures of a French crusader, Christof Romuald, through Prague and Vienna in the Dark Ages and modern-day London and New York City. The game is based on the pen-and-paper roleplaying game Vampire: The Masquerade.<br/><br/>In the game's storyline, the protagonist Christof falls in love with a nun named Anezka who tends his wounds after he falls in battle. Christof, not fully recovered, ventures into the Bonn Silver Mines (near Prague) to kill Ahzra the Unliving, a twisted Tzimisce vampire. His glorious return to Prague doesn't go unnoticed by the local vampire leaders and soon he is &quot;embraced&quot; (turned into a vampire) by Ecaterina the Wise, leader of the Brujah clan, as to boost the ranks of vampires in preparation for a brewing battle between vampire clans. Having been made one of the undead, the passionate crusader has to realize that he deviated from his religious mission long ago; being only a mundane soldier, he was easy prey for the vampires. His rebellious nature, however, urges him to find a way to redeem his soul, perhaps by regaining his mortal state. But before long, in a move designed to torment Christof (in retaliation for dispatching Ahzra), the nun is kidnapped and turned into a ghoul, a servitor to vampires addicted to vampire blood. This changes Christof's part in the course of events, since he is now being wracked with guilt as he feels his affection towards Anezka led her down a path of sin. Christof swears to face the vampires who took her and restore her life as human.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Vampire:_The_Masquerade_\u2013_Redemption,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "72042": {"poll": [], "name": "Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/UK Windows edition", "German Windows Edition (uncut)", "IT Windows Release", "US Windows edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic733682.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Vampire: The Masquerade"], "videogametheme": ["Horror"], "videogamefranchise": ["Better Description Needed", "World of Darkness"], "usersrated": "192", "videogamedeveloper": ["Troika Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Action RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "videogamehonor": ["2003 Game Critics Best Role Playing Game of the Year Nominee", "2004 Game Critics Best Role Playing Game of the Year Nominee", "2005 D.I.C.E.

The player character's ability to overcome obstacles is in many cases a mixture of player and character abilities, with character stats determining the effectiveness of actions, and player abilities determining whether or not the actions succeed. For example, the ability to move silently and avoid being detected is heavily influenced by the character's Dexterity and Stealth ratings; however, if the player does not stay in the shadows while sneaking past enemies, the character can still be detected.<br/><br/>The player character increases in power dramatically during the course of the game through the expenditure of earned experience points on attributes, skills, and vampire abilities called &quot;Disciplines&quot;. A multitude of items, weapons, and books can be found or purchased to make the player character even more powerful. Melee and ranged weapons exist in equal numbers, although only in the later stages of the game.<br/><br/>How the player interacts with the game world varies depending upon which clan the player character belongs to. Differences range from different dialogue options becoming available to certain quests becoming available or unavailable. The most notable gameplay differences are experienced by those who play as Malkavian (due to their insanity, dialogue options are often non sequiturs, making it difficult to conduct conversations and negotiations; Malkavians also encounter numerous bizarre moments during gameplay, such as television sets and stop signs speaking to them) and Nosferatu (who, in order to avoid Masquerade violations, are prohibited from speaking to humans and who do not have access to any gameplay options involving seduction).<br/><br/>Unlike most CRPGs, the experience needed to increase stats and skills is not awarded for killing enemies. Experience points are awarded solely for completing quests, no matter how many creatures the player eliminates in the process (though the quest objective often involves killing). This encourages the player to complete quests in creative ways and significantly increases the game's replay value.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Vampire:_The_Masquerade_-_Bloodlines,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "72043": {"poll": [], "name": "Hexplore", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/UK/Dutch Windows edition", "US Windows edition"], "average": "7.75", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamecharacter": ["Avalonia", "Darkor", "Demagos", "Drulak", "Garkham", "Khat", "K\u00f6rnagen", "Mac Bride", "Oxalis", "Tuek", "Turgarra", "Uraeus", "Vigrad", "Yesdi"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Doki Denki Studio"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Atari, Inc.", "Ocean Software"], "vgcharacterversion": ["Avalonia", "Darkor", "Demagos", "Drulak", "Garkham", "Khat", "K\u00f6rnagen", "Mac Bride", "Oxalis", "Tuek", "Turgarra", "Uraeus", "Vigrad", "Yesdi"], "description": "&quot;Set in 1000 AD, the player explores the world as MacBride, the adventurer.

In the 22nd century Mental's forces return to Earth hell-bent on eradicating humankind: as a last resort the usage of the &quot;Time Lock&quot; is decided: this Sirian device can send back through time a single individual who can, hopefully, defeat Mental and alter the course of history. Because of his bravery in fighting the monsters, Sam &quot;Serious&quot; Stone is chosen to use the &quot;Time Lock&quot;. As the game opens, Sam appears in ancient Egypt: his travels from one Egyptian monument to the next, all the way fighting against the monsters Mental sent after him, make up most of the story of The First Encounter. During his wandering, Sam is able to activate a hidden Sirian communicator, located in Luxor, that summons to Earth a starship from the depths of space. Sam goes to the Great Pyramid for a rendezvous with the ship and, after a titanic battle against Mental's general Ugh Zan III, he is whisked on-board the Sirian starship.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Serious_Sam,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "72047": {"poll": [], "name": "Serious Sam: The Second Encounter", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/UK Windows edition", "Japanese Windows edition", "US Windows edition", "Windows Downloadable HD edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic733671.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Serious Sam"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy", "Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "50", "videogamecharacter": ["Sam \"Serious\" Stone"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Croteam"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "First Person Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "7.036", "statistics": [], "videogamecompilation": ["The Serious Sam Collection"], "videogamepublisher": ["Cyber Front", "Gathering of Developers", "Majesco Entertainment", "Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc."], "vgcharacterversion": ["Serious Sam"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic733671_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;The Second Encounter starts right where the previous chapter left off, with Sam travelling to Sirius on the starship. Unfortunately Sam's vehicle is accidentally hit by the &quot;Croteam crate-bus&quot; and plummets down to Earth's surface. Serious Sam crash lands in Central America in the Mayan age. However not all is lost, since the Sirians left a back-up ship on Earth. Since this vehicle is located in a different age from the one Sam finds himself, the hero has to uncover the locations of a number of Sirian time-gates that will help him reach his destination. With this objective Sam storms through Mesoamerica, then travels to Mesopotamia and finally to medieval Europe where the starship is located. On his way, Sam battles two of Mental's timelock guardians: the spirit named Kukulkan the Wind God and a biomechanical creature, the Exotech Larva. Finally, in front of the Cathedral of Holy Blood, Sam confronts Mordekai The Summoner, the last obstacle to overcome on his path to the Holy Grail. After a time-consuming battle with Mordekai's minions, The Summoner is finally silenced forever. In the cathedral, Sam lifts the Holy Grail, followed by his confession of his sins in a booth... to Mental, during which he reassures Mental that &quot;he's coming to get him.&quot;<br/><br/>Other than the more varied locations, The Second Encounter features some additional weapons&mdash;a chainsaw, a flamethrower, a sniper rifle, and the powerful Serious Bomb&mdash;and a number of new monsters that Sam has to face.

It is the fifth and final chapter in the current story arc, chronologically after God of War II. God of War III, however, is not the last God of War game of the series.<br/><br/>God of War III features gameplay similar to that of previous installments. The player controls Kratos in a combination of combat, platforming, and puzzle game elements. Kratos's main weapons are the Blades of Exile (notwithstanding the short period at the beginning where Kratos wields the Blades of Athena). Other new weapons include the Claws of Hades, the Nemesis Whip (made from the Omphalos Stone by Hephaestus), and the Nemean Cestus (a pair of fist gauntlets shaped like lion heads acquired from Hercules). This new weapon has the ability to smash through solid objects made of onyx and to plow through enemy shields, but has a slightly smaller range than the extending chains on the Blades of Exile. The Claws of Hades and Nemesis Whip are similar to the Blades of Exile, both being used in the same fashion as the Blades of Exile, but with their own combos and magic abilities.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;God_of_War_III,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>", "videogameseries": ["God of War"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "videogamehonor": ["2009 Game Critics Best Action/Adventure Game of the Year Nominee", "2009 Game Critics Best Console Game of the Year Nominee", "2009 Gamescom Best Playstation Game of the Year Nominee", "2009 Spike Most Anticipated Game Next Year Winner", "2010 Game Critics Game of the Year Nominee", "2010 Spike Best Action Adventure Game of the Year Nominee", "2010 Spike Best Graphics of the Year Winner", "2010 Spike Best Original Score of the Year Nominee", "2010 Spike Best PlayStation Game of the Year Winner", "2010 Spike Game of the Year Nominee", "2011 British Academy Game Awards Best Action Game of the Year Nominee", "2011 British Academy Game Awards Best Art Direction of the Year Winner", "2011 British Academy Game Awards Best Gameplay of the Year Nominee", "2011 D.I.C.E.

Set in a fictional city in Europe, the game centers on its eponymous character, Bayonetta, who uses pistols and magical attacks to defeat enemies. The game has five difficulty settings; its two easiest settings contain a game mode playable with only one button, similar to a mode used in Devil May Cry. Its developers designed its characters with modern style and fashion in mind, and composed for it a largely upbeat soundtrack.<br/><br/>Development of the game started around January 2007, and it was released in Japan in late October 2009, with a U.S. release following in January 2010. It has been promoted through a television commercial with music by Japanese pop singer MiChi, look-alike searches, a theme for the Google Chrome Web browser, a photo book, and soundtracks. In the United States and the United Kingdom, commercials have featured La Roux's &quot;In for the Kill (Skream's Let's Get Ravey Remix)&quot;. Critical reviews have praised its easily learned moves, fast pace, boss battles, time slowdown or &quot;Witch Time&quot; mechanic, and character and stage designs.

As a single-player dark heroic fantasy RPG, Dragon Age features a return to pause-and-play combat, a significant amount of interactions with NPCs, and several different origin stories to introduce you to the world of Ferelden.<br/><br/>In Dragon Age, your character-- either a noble from one of Ferelden's honored families, an elf who is scarred by interactions with humans, a dwarf who only knew life in his or her native city, or a mage shunned by the outside-- is called to join the Grey Wardens to investigate an unusual appearance of darkspawn, who are soldiers tainted by demonic forces. A darkspawn invasion, also known as a Blight, has not occurred in centuries-- and the Grey Wardens have also long since been through their heyday, while Ferelden itself is a land sharply divided by its internal politics.<br/><br/>As a squad-based RPG, your team of NPCs will be crucial for your victory-- but you have to balance an eclectic group of individuals and strive to win their loyalty, friendship, and possibly even love. A vast amount of content in DA is found in simply exploring the various cities, or talking to your companions in camp and discovering their motivations for joining you, as well as their own perspectives and views of Ferelden life.<br/><br/>", "videogameseries": ["Dragon Age"], "videogamedeveloper": ["BioWare"], "videogamehonor": ["2008 Game Critics Best PC Game of the Year Nominee", "2008 Game Critics Best Role Playing Game of the Year Nominee", "2009 Game Critics Best PC Game of the Year Nominee", "2009 Game Critics Best Role Playing Game of the Year Nominee", "2009 Game Critics Game of the Year Nominee", "2009 Spike Best PC Game of the Year Winner", "2009 Spike Best RPG of the Year Winner", "2010 British Academy Game Awards Best Story/Narrative of the Year Nominee", "2010 CVA Best Audio of the Year Nominee", "2010 CVA Best Console Game of the Year Nominee", "2010 CVA Best Narration of the Year Nominee", "2010 CVA Best Visual Arts of the Year Nominee", "2010 CVA Game of the Year Winner", "2010 D.I.C.E.

However, WC2 places a greater emphasis on storytelling, providing various sprite-animated cutscenes and some of the industry's first examples of voice acting. The storyline is also somewhat less open-ended: the game's campaign tree is much more structured and the player character can no longer be promoted or awarded medals. Wingmen can no longer be killed during normal gameplay; when their fighters are damaged beyond repair, they eject (though some die in scripted sequences). Finally, because the story is a direct sequel to WC1, many Kilrathi ships have names similar to the WC1 ships they replace (for instance, the &quot;Sartha&quot; replaces the &quot;Salthi&quot;, and the Confederation uses an upgraded version of the Rapier medium fighter).<br/><br/>The year 2656.

For example - when you pass the ball to another player, he will in most cases imediately return the ball to you, since the same &quot;button&quot; means &quot;pass&quot; and &quot;call for the ball&quot;. So instead of receiving the ball and moving forward or passing onwards, he returns the ball back to you - if you're lucky enough it doesn't get stolen before it reaches you. It also lags like it was running on a computer for middle age - when you get close to the goal and press to shoot it takes about two second before your player actually kicks the ball and in most cases the goalkeeper will by then throw himself on the ball and all you can do is cry.

These creatures can leave Dimension X, and also return<br/>to it...&quot;<br/><br/>The rules of the game are simple. The goal is to checkmate your opponent's king. You start with 2 chess boards next to each other. On one board, you play a normal chess game, making 1 move per turn. On the other board each player has 3 short range pieces - creatures with strange powers - that may only move in Dimension X and only attack in our dimension. Each player, during his or her turn, also either moves one of the Dimension X creatures on the second board, crosses between dimensions, or attacks with a creature in our dimension.<br/><br/>This is a most unusual 3D chess variant that quite literally adds a whole other level of tactics and strategy to chess, with a twist.<br/><br/>"}, "72119": {"poll": [], "name": "Crazy Comets", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Commodore 64 release"], "average": "7.66667", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "3", "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Commodore 64"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Martech"], "description": "User summary<br/><br/>Crazy Comets is a 1985 Commodore 64 game written by Simon Nicol and published by Martech.

It is an historic fact that the spices trade, brought by the Caravelles, had to pay a tax of 5% in Lisbon, and this tax was used to pay for the monastery construction.<br/><br/>The goal is to achieve the highest possible number of victory points (VPs). The game ends when the last piece of Jeronimos is bought by any player.<br/><br/>The boardgame is the world map with 32 ports / destinations marked around the world (Americas, Africa, Asia and Indic Islands). In 8 of them you can collect the respective merchandise from that port. The board has also marked the real sea currents that the Caravelles followed at the time. It is surprising that often the fastest way is not the shortest, and the game reveals that perfectly.<br/><br/>Each player has a card representing 3 ships, and indicating the player's ability to travel (translated into 9 navigation discs) and the cargo capacity (translated into 6 different merchandise spaces).<br/><br/>The players place their wood ship piece in the board in Lisbon and start navigating. If they follow the sea currents marked in the board, they can do it &quot;free of charge&quot; and endlessly. But they wouldn't go very far. Every time a player wants to go in a different direction than the one indicated by the sea current, he has to use a navigation disc from his player card. When all the navigation discs are used, the player turn stops. So, in each turn, a player can go against the currents at most 9 times, thus determining how far he can go.<br/><br/>During navigation, players arrive in ports. If they are the first to get there, that is, if they are the ones that discover that local, they can place their coloured marker in that port and register the number of VPs marked for that port. If the port is a &quot;trade port&quot; (there are 8), the player can also collect the respective merchandise and place it in his player card.<br/><br/>But there are also some possible surprises. When navigate, players can pass by special marked cells which force them some kind of effect:<br/><br/>- &quot;Event&quot; cells: for each round, players have 5 &quot;Event&quot; cards in their hand; when they pass over these cells, they must choose a card from their hand. These cards can be of 3 types: &quot;Storm Card&quot;, &quot;Dead Calm Sea Cards&quot; and &quot;Good Wind Cards&quot;, thus having negative or positive effects in their navigation. But they also have an effect on other players, but for these the effect is always positive. This creates interest during players downtime. <br/>- &quot;Pirate Cells&quot;: when passing over these cells, players lose immediately 1 of their navigation discs. they can only enter the cell if they have the necessary disc available to pay.<br/>- &quot;Sinking Cells&quot;: when passing over these cells, players must take their chance with a 50/50 dice - worse can happen is they lose 1 of the 3 ships they have (or 4 - see below), and the corresponding cargo space.

A major threat to Harry's survival are the hostile creatures wandering along the streets and inside buildings, and poor visibility means that Harry will almost always be surrounded by thick fog or darkness. The player will locate a pocket-size flashlight early in the game, but the light beam only illuminates for a few feet.  For this reason, sound plays a large role in Silent Hill' gameplay, as the player will often be alerted to the noises enemies make, rather than the actual sight of them.  As well as the flashlight, the player will also pick up a radio, which alerts Harry to the presence of creatures by emitting static when they are in proximity, allowing him to detect monsters before they can ambush him.  Another obstacle to Harry's success is his own fragility; being an ordinary man with minimal experience in handling weapons, he cannot sustain many blows from enemies, and will gasp for breath when he has sprinted for a large distance.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Silent_Hill_(video_game),&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "72138": {"rpgartist": ["Pawel Dobosz", "Kim Feigenbaum", "Piotr Nowojewski", "Maciej Zagorski"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Edition", "PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Kingdoms of Legend: The Hidden Threat", "rpgdesigner": ["Brent Evanger"], "rpgproducer": ["Nathanael Christen", "Nick Christen", "Allen Drees, Jr.", "Chuck Lang", "Dagan McGregor"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic731933.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Kingdoms of Legend"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Sword & Sorcery)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Interaction Point Games"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic731933_t.jpg", "description": "(from the back cover)<br/><br/>Danger Lurks Below Turnberry Castle!<br/>A group of novice adventurers responds to the desperate call of the castle steward.

Your only hope is to try to make it across unknown terrain past horrible monsters to an escape shuttle at the abandoned ecology survey station.

So, tread carefully Space Ranger... and pray you don't taste too delicious.<br/><br/>Gameplay Abstract<br/><br/>Players take on the role of characters moving from a crash site location to an abandoned ecology station using point to point movement.  The first player to reach the ecology station is the winner.  As players move their pawns through locations, they must roll a die to avoid detection by alien monsters represented by tokens.  If detected, they must fight.  Individual players use characters with individual strengths and weaknesses and player powers, helping them avoid or defeat monsters.

The timeframe is the near future, between 2013 and 2021. The game has been designed by Bruce Costello using the CSR Award winning system that first appeared in Strategy &amp; Tactics no. 250. It&rsquo;s adaptable for two player, multi-player and solitaire play.<br/><br/>RDGC expands the original game into a two-mapper covering the Indian Ocean and Middle East, areas strategic to both the US and its allies and the Peoples Republic of China and its allies.<br/>In the game, Chinese forces that may be initially deployed into the Indian Ocean area are few, but they also have one solid ally at start: Myanmar. Besides Myanmar, there are other question marks for US planners. For instance, would Pakistan stand idly by if India allied with the US, given the existential threat they perceive of a US-Indian victory in a war with China? And what about Iran: if that country is ever to make a move to achieve dominance in the Persian Gulf, what better time than during a major war while its winners aren&rsquo;t yet clear? There&rsquo;s also the rest of the troubled Middle East (Egypt-Syria-Lebanon-Israel). That collective totality makes for a wonderfully varied gaming situation. Besides the main scenarios, there are numerous variants and options, adding new dimensions and giving literally hundreds of new possibilities for play.<br/><br/>Most of the ground units in RDGC represent brigades (&ldquo;brigade combat teams&rdquo; or &ldquo;BCT&rdquo; for the US). The exceptions are the Singaporean, Malaysian, Taiwanese, Philippine, and Yemeni armies. There is additionally one new corps of marines for the PRC. Aircraft are mostly represented by mixed-type combat-wings, though only one aircraft type is shown on each counter. Long-range bombers have their own mono-type units that can&rsquo;t combine operations with the other &lsquo;tactical&rsquo; air wings. Ship units mostly represent mission-oriented groups of vessels such as SAGs, subrons or individual capital ships.<br/><br/>Game turns represent varied amounts of &ldquo;real time,&rdquo; depending on the &ldquo;operation&rdquo; presently being conducted, from one to three days. An entire match encompasses the first month of the wars being examined. Scenarios include partial and two-map games, some centered on the Korean peninsula, others on the Indo-Pakistan area, and others taking in the entire, huge, arcing region from the Red Sea to Alaska.<br/><br/>This special edition includes 2 maps (22x34 inches) and 352 counters.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Modern War Magazine Edition"], "average": "7.15217", "name": "Red Dragon / Green Crescent", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Dice Rolling"], "age": "14", "usersrated": "46", "boardgamefamily": ["Magazine: Modern War"]}, "72202": {"boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "boardgamedesigner": ["Mark Steere"], "poll": [], "name": "Cage", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic733777_t.jpg", "average": "4.66667", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "(Web published)", "Mark Steere Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic733777.jpg", "boardgamefamily": ["Combinatorial"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Print & Play"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Cage is a finite, omnidirectional Checkers variant.

This is more than a scouting party; this is a war party! They begin to attack the shields as the crew starts to retrieve debris. The SOS has been sent and a ship in the sector has responded, but can it get to you before the &quot;bugs&quot; overwhelm your crew? Can you repair parts of the ship and use it as a defense? Can you repair the hull and fire up the engine to lift off? It's all in the hands of the crew &ndash; your hands.<br/><br/>In Alien Uprising, the player crew must either hold off the Zothren attacks until the rescue ship arrives, or repair the ship and lift off from the hostile planet before being destroyed.

Areas on fire require 2 Actions to move into, taint whenever three minions are present, instead of 4 and deal wounds to Heroes remaining in the area at the end of their turns.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The Generals each have their own special nastiness as well. For example, Brimstone, instead of moving along the usual red-General path, moves every time her card comes up when Darkness Spreads, flitting here and there and setting the world on fire. Players can lose cards when attacking Hemlock.<br/><br/>Any of the new dragons can also be used as an Agent of the Dark Lord when playing with at least one of the original Generals (Varkolak, Gorgut, or Balazarg). You can add up to 5 of the 10 Global Effects Cards (5 Good, 5 Bad) to the Darkness Spreads deck to adjust the toughness of your campaign. Likewise, a number of Royal Blessing Tokens (4 max) can also be added to the game. Royal Blessings allow players to either ignore a Darkness Spreads card, remove a taint crystal or prevent a General from moving.<br/><br/>For a more Campaign-style game, players can utilize the King's Champion Scoring Variant which allows players to track their feats, major and minor. Feat examples include: taking on 3 minions at once, killing two with one blow, attempting to complete a quest, successfully completing a quest, healing the land, putting out a fire, dealing wounds or the killing blow to a General... The player with the most fame at the end of the game becomes the King's Champion. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th most famous Heroes also receive titles and awards. The titles and awards each provide a special ability to that character that can be utilized the next time it is played by the same player.<br/><br/>Scheduled to debut at Spiel 2010 is the Dragon Expansion (formerly the Black Dragon expansion), which consists of the following:<br/><br/>3 General Miniatures (3 Dragons) <br/>3 New General Cards<br/>1 New Sapphire (Blue Dragon) General Card<br/>4 Wound Tokens 1 for each General <br/>3 Agents of the Dark Lord Cards<br/>10 Fire Tokens <br/>4 Royal Blessing Tokens<br/>1 Royal Blessing Card <br/>12 New Quest Cards<br/>10 Global Effects Cards <br/>1 Fame Card<br/>6 New Special Cards <br/>New Darkness Spreads Deck<br/>New Hero Cards Deck <br/>King&rsquo;s Champion Variant Scoring Tokens <br/>7 Kings Champion Reward Cards<br/>Rulebook and A Story from the Realm<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "English second edition"], "average": "7.678", "name": "Defenders of the Realm: The Dragon Expansion", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management"], "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": ["Defenders of the Realm"], "usersrated": "370", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Dragons", "Defenders of the Realm"]}, "72239": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Three-Card Monte", "playingtime": "5", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Betting/Wagering"], "yearpublished": "1500", "usersrated": "11", "boardgamefamily": ["Traditional Card Games"], "maxplayers": "3", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2909320_t.jpg", "average": "2.22727", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Public Domain)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2909320.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Public Domain edition"], "maxplaytime": "5", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Card Game", "Children's Game"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "5", "description": "Three-Card Monte is played one of two ways.

Every round each player has 3 available actions: Hiring, Winemaking, and Trading. Players perform actions in turn, and the order in which they perform them has consequences.<br/>In the Hiring-action, the player hires a winemaker or a winemaster who can make wine, and he can hire the Lobbyist or Mr. Ros&eacute; who can influence the market place. In the winemaking-action the player makes wine and in the Trading-action he buys or sells it at the Wine Stock Market.

If you inflict damage, it lowers the enemy piece's life points.)  If several pieces are in a combat square, they all get an attack.  If it doesn't resolve in one swing each, then combat is continued in the next person's turn.  This means that you can send in re-inforcements.  Each piece class has different dexterity and hit points and some have armor.  All of this is listed on an easy to read stat sheet with bubbles to fill in for damage.<br/><br/>Check is handled in traditional style of check and checkmate.  But there are times when you can actually go head to head with the king in his square and check mate him.<br/><br/>The advanced game includes 4 more rules:<br/><br/>    Withdrawal (escaping from a combat square)<br/>    Healing (Bishops and Queens can heal damaged pieces)<br/>    Forced Retreat (Queens can kick other pieces out of her square)<br/>    Carrying (Knights can carry a pawn or a bishop and Rooks can carry anything except another rook or the king)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In Advanced Tournament Games, winning pieces are declared veteran and they go up a rank either getting more hit points, do more damage or improve dexterity.<br/><br/>Fantasy Chess has the capacity for 4 player games.<br/>Bump two Fantasy Chess boards next to each other and play ally with your partner with full use of both boards as you try to checkmate your opponents.<br/><br/>This can even be expanded into a 5+ player game by either bumping more boards together or having a Game Master who can run some home rule creature pieces as interference or aid to the two main players.

The ruler of the island, Isaac Dukas Comnenus, tried unsuccessfully to repel the Crusaders&rsquo; landing before falling back to Nicosia to regroup his forces. Once assured of the safety of his fleet, Richard set off into the interior of the island. Isaac marched against him, hoping to confront him in a vast plain favorable to the maneuvers of the redoubtable Byzantine cavalry. The clash occurred near the village of Tremithousa on May 21, 1191. The cavalry charges were horrendous and for a time the issue was in doubt, but the Anglo-Normans&rsquo; heavy knights finally prevailed. Isaac was captured, and this caused the Greeks to rout. Richard, now in control of Cyprus, could resume his journey to the Holy Land.<br/>He joined Philip Augustus at Saint Jean d&rsquo;Acre, which fell on July 12. When Philip returned to France, Richard gained sole command of the Crusader army. He marched south with the intention of liberating Jerusalem, but on September 7, 1194, Saladin attacked the Christians as they made their way down the coast. Showered with arrows, the Hospitaliers launched a premature charge, forcing Richard to give the signal for a general attack. After a violent counterattack, Saladin&rsquo;s troops were finally vanquished by one last charge of the Crusaders.

It is a sequel to Clock Tower for the SNES (also known as Clock Tower ~The First Fear~ on its PlayStation port).<br/><br/>There are two novels and a radio drama based on the game. They were not released outside of Japan.<br/><br/>Clock Tower is a point and click survival horror game, with the player controlling a cursor to direct the character and give commands such as to investigate objects. The interface is akin to 1990-era computer adventure games, but simplified to work better with a gamepad.<br/><br/>The game is separated into three scenarios, including a prologue during which the main character for the rest of the game is decided. In the prologue, the player controls Samuel Barton. In the first scenario, the player either plays as Jennifer Simpson or Helen Maxwell. The playable character for the second scenario can either be Nolan, Stan, or Helen. Between each scenario, there is additionally an intermission, in which the player can explore the town and gather clues via a 'world map' before moving on to the next level.<br/><br/>In the Japanese version, there is a secret mode unlockable by getting all 10 endings called Buyo Buyo Mode. If the mode is turned on during the game, all of the characters change size and width repeatedly.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Clock_Tower_(PlayStation),&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "72327": {"poll": [], "name": "Rival Schools: United By Fate", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Arcade edition", "English/European PlayStation edition", "Japanese PlayStation edition", "North American PlayStation edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic735948.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Rival Schools"], "videogametheme": ["School"], "usersrated": "13", "videogamedeveloper": ["Capcom Co., Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade", "PlayStation"], "average": "6.42308", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Capcom Co., Ltd.", "Virgin Interactive"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic735948_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Rival Schools: United By Fate\u200b (\u79c1\u7acb\u30b8\u30e3\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9\u5b66\u5712 LEGION OF HEROES Shiritsu Justice Gakuen: Legion of Heroes,? &quot;Justice Private Academy: Legion of Heroes&quot;) is a 3D competitive fighting game produced by Capcom originally released as an arcade game in 1997 and ported to the PlayStation in 1998.<br/><br/>The main fighting game is best described as a polygonal Marvel vs. Capcom game, with some notable differences. Control wise, the game varies from other Capcom fighting games by only having four buttons (two punches and two kicks, which is closer to the SNK game format) rather than the standard six. A player chooses a team of two characters, and fights against another two character team. The actual fights, however, are one-on-one fights, with the partner only participating by being called in when a player has enough 'vigor' for a Team Up attack, done by pressing a punch and kick button of the same pressure. The Team Ups would be some kind of double team attack by the character and partner, or (for most female characters' Team Ups) would heal the main character or give them more vigor. After the end of a round, a player (win or lose) has a choice to fight the next round with the partner from the previous round, or to keep their main character in play. The 'vigor' meter (essentially a super meter) could go up to 9 levels, with Team Ups costing two levels and super moves from a single person all costing one level of vigor. Much like the Marvel vs. Capcom games, launchers can be done that allow air combos to be performed, with all characters having universal low and high launchers.<br/><br/>The game also had a few defensive techniques:<br/><br/>- Tardy Counters acted much like Alpha Counters from Street Fighter Alpha, allowing a player to immediately counter-attack from a blocking position. However, the restrictions on Tardy Counters are very lax; any hard normal, special or super attack can be used to Tardy counter (Alpha counters are only limited to certain special moves for each character), and Tardy Counters do not cost any extra vigor to perform (Alpha Counters required at least a level of Super Combo gauge to do).<br/><br/>- Attack Cancels allowed a player to cancel an incoming hit simply by timing their own hit with the attack, which would cancel out both attacks (though it does not nullify the remaining hits of a multi-hit move).&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Rival_Schools,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "72328": {"rpgdesigner": ["Darran Allan", "John Baker", "Andrew Shaw", "Rob Smith"], "statistics": [], "name": "Future Roleplayer (Issue 3 - Jun/Jul 1995)", "rpgartist": ["James Boswell"], "rpgproducer": ["John Baker", "Rob Smith"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic735646.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Future Roleplayer"], "rpg": ["Future Roleplayer"], "rpgissueversion": ["Issue 3"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic735646_t.jpg", "description": "Contents:<br/><br/>&bull;Free Disks Offer:Two more stunning free disks, jam packed full with roleplaying programs.<br/>&bull;News: Mindscape have finally wrested the licence for Warhammer Fantasy Battles and Warhammer 40K from Games Workshop.<br/>&bull;TSR's 1995 European GenCon Show Report: Europe's largest gaming convention was a great event. <br/>&bull;Ian Livingstone: The founder of Games Workshop talks about his new role as MD at Domark Software.<br/>&bull;Readers Survey: It had to happen eventually.<br/>&bull;Playing with Yourself: An overview of PBM games.<br/>&bull;Silicon Aids: Get to grips with spreadsheets to ease the hassle of complex calculations.<br/>&bull;Entering Cyberspace: This month the usenet newsgroups.

Like other Lego video games such as Lego Star Wars and Lego Batman, Lego Indiana Jones 2 lets the player control a Lego figure in areas related to movie scenes and situations, with an emphasis on exploration and problem-solving. It can be played solo or by two people simultaneously, with the same drop in/out co-op play which has become a staple of the Lego series. The game includes adaptions of the original three Indiana Jones movies. These offer all-new levels; none of the content has been recycled from the original game. There are also bonus levels that have to be discovered and are made using the level creator. Upon finishing these levels, the player can edit them at any time.<br/><br/>Unlike previous Lego games, Lego Indiana Jones 2 includes a level creator where players can create their own levels and objects. Two-player co-op mode has been enhanced with split-screen; rather than forcing both characters to always be close enough to fit on the same screen, the game will seamlessly split when characters wander apart and merge into one screen when both players are near each other. The hub has also been redesigned; where before each hub was a small area with easy access to levels which had been unlocked, now each hub is a large area in which entrances to levels must be discovered.<br/><br/>This game has trophy support on the PlayStation 3 version and on November 23, 2009, LucasArts revealed on Twitter that it is working on a patch for Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game which will enable online co-op gameplay.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Lego_Indiana_Jones_2:_The_Adventure_Continues,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "72359": {"poll": [], "name": "Killzone 2", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Australian PlayStation 3 edition", "English/European PlayStation 3 edition", "IT Collector's Edition (Edizione Limitata per Collezionisti)", "Japanese PlayStation 3 edition", "North American Playstation 3 edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1012303.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Killzone"], "videogametheme": ["Aliens", "Science Fiction"], "videogamefranchise": ["Greatest Hits (Best Selling PlayStation Games, US)", "Platinum Range (Best Selling PlayStation Games, PAL)"], "usersrated": "75", "videogamedeveloper": ["Guerrilla Games"], "videogamegenre": ["First Person Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 3"], "videogamehonor": ["2007 Game Critics Best Graphics, Sound or Innovation of the Year Winner (Graphics)", "2009 Golden Joystick PlayStation Game of the Year Winner", "2009 Spike Best Graphics of the Year Nominee", "2009 Spike Best PlayStation Game of the Year Nominee", "2009 Spike Best Shooter of the Year Nominee", "2010 D.I.C.E.

It is the third installment in the Killzone series that began on the PlayStation 2 with Killzone and continued on the PlayStation Portable with Killzone: Liberation. The game was first announced at E3 2005, with a tech demo on display, while the first gameplay footage was shown two years later at E3 2007. Killzone 2 was released worldwide late February 2009.<br/><br/>Killzone 2 follows the events of Killzone and Killzone: Liberation, and is set entirely on the planet Helghan, the home-world of the Helghast who invaded an Interplanetary Strategic Alliance (ISA) colony. Two years after the Helghast assault on Vekta, the ISA had launched an assault on the enemy's homeworld of Helghan. The ISA goal is to capture the Helghast leader, Emperor Scolar Visari, and bring the Helghast war machine to a halt. Players assume the role of Sergeant Tomas &quot;Sev&quot; Sevchenko, a battle-hardened veteran of the special forces unit the &quot;Legion&quot; assigned to Alpha team, who goes on a mission to take out the Helghast threat.<br/><br/>During the invasion of Helghan, Sev's unit is deployed behind enemy lines to assist the main invasion force. Tasked with securing the enemy capital of Pyrhus, Helghan's first true city, the team quickly discovers that the Helghast are a more formidable enemy on their home planet. Not only are they well-adapted to Helghan's hostile conditions, they have also harnessed the power of the freakish lightning storms that always occur on Helghan which they can now use against the ISA. A cold, barren, unforgiving world, Helghan provides a ready defense with thick, acidic air, dust clouds, and violent surgical lightning storms. Sev discovers his squad is not just fighting enemy forces&mdash;their fiercest opponent may be the planet itself.<br/><br/>There is both a lengthy campaign mode and 32 player multiplayer. Warzone, the title of the online multiplayer component of Killzone 2 has been developed by Guerrilla Games in conjunction with the game's single-player campaign. The online multiplayer gameplay is class-based, meaning the player can choose a class of character which is specialized for a specific role to better suit the player's needs in battle. There are 7 classes in total, in which the player can mix and match two according to their playing style, and can switch abilities upon death.<br/><br/>Warzone plays out through dynamic matches where multiple game types are played in a single round. The game ships with five different game types including Assassination, Search &amp; Retrieve, Search &amp; Destroy, Bodycount and Capture &amp; Hold. Online matches can connect 2 to 32 players, and they can group into six squads of up to four players. If an online match does not have a full 32 players, computer-generated &quot;bots&quot; can be added in to create bigger teams (but only in an unranked match). Killzone 2 also offers a clan system, which allows clans of up to 64 players to compete for &quot;Valor Points&quot;, an in-game currency that clans can use to bet on tournaments. When playing online a player can search for a specific game type if they want, for example, if a player only wanted to play bodycount they could search for that and the available games would appear.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Killzone_2,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "72360": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Sigur\u00f0ur G.

Unlike the original Contra, the arcade version of Super Contra was distributed in Europe with its original title and cooperative 2-player feature intact. A home version of Super Contra was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990, which was localized as Super C in North America and Probotector II: Return of the Evil Forces in the PAL region.<br/><br/>In Super Contra, the alien forces from the original game have taken over a base in an undisclosed region of South America and the players once again assume the roles of protagonists Bill Rizer and Lance Bean to counter the invasion.<br/><br/>Set a year after the events of the original Contra, Bill and Lance, the heroes from the previous game, are sent on a second mission. This time, the alien forces from the previous game have taken over an allied military base, possessing most of its troops. Bill and Lance must not only fight against their former comrade-in-arms, but also a new mutated form of the same alien creatures they fought during their previous mission.<br/><br/>The arcade version of Super Contra plays essentially the same as its predecessor. The main difference was in its versatility. While the original Contra had two different perspectives (a side-view and a 3D view), Super Contra replaces the 3D stages with top-view stages similar to other overhead shooters at the time such as Commando and Ikari Warriors. Additionally, the side-view stages of Super Contra featured inclined surfaces, which were not in the original Contra. In the arcade version, the player can now control the height of their jump; by holding the joystick up and pressing the jump button will allow for a higher jump; likewise the player can perform low jumps as well by holding down-right or down-left while pressing the jump button. The arcade version is composed of five stages which spans a military base, a jungle and an alien lair. Stage 1, 3, 4 are side-view stages, while Stage 2 and 5 are top-view stages.<br/><br/>Like in the original Contra, the player can upgrade their default gun into one of the following four special weapons: the Machine Gun, the Spread Gun, a Laser Gun, and a Bomb Gun. Unlike the other games in the series, the power-up icons are now represented by the actual weapons wielded by the character instead of the traditional letter-based falcon icons. The player can upgrade their weapon by picking it up twice in a row. In the top-view stages, the player can also pick up and carry a &quot;Mega Shell&quot;, which can be launched by pressing the jump button, killing all on-screen enemies.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Super_Contra,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "72380": {"poll": [], "name": "Contra III: The Alien Wars", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Game Boy Advance edition", "English/European SNES edition", "eShop Wii Downloadable edition", "eShop Wii U Downloadable edition", "eShop Wii U Downloadable edition", "Japanese Super Famicom edition", "North American Game Boy Advance edition", "North American Game Boy edition", "North American SNES edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic735921.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Contra"], "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "104", "videogamedeveloper": ["Factor 5", "Konami"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Platform", "Run-and-gun", "Scrolling"], "videogameplatform": ["Game Boy", "Game Boy Advance", "SNES", "Wii", "Wii U"], "average": "7.34423", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Konami"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic735921_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Contra III: The Alien Wars, released in Japan as Contra Spirits (\u9b42\u6597\u7f85\u30b9\u30d4\u30ea\u30c3\u30c4) and in the PAL region as Super Probotector: Alien Rebels, is a 1992 run and gun game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System produced by Konami. It is the third console iteration of the Contra series, following the original Contra and Super C for the NES.<br/><br/>Taking advantage of the then new technology provided by the Super NES, the graphics in Contra III improved upon the NES versions of the first two installments, bringing it closer to the quality of the arcade versions. The level design is more complex, and provides more opportunity for interaction. For instance, players can grab on to poles or ceilings and navigate them in a monkey bar fashion, climb walls and ladders, destroy buildings and scenery, and commandeer tanks.<br/><br/>New styles of levels in The Alien Wars involve motorcycle chases, riding on missiles, and two Mode 7 enabled overhead levels. The weapons system is revamped, and players can carry two weapons instead of one, only losing the one they are currently using if they die. They can also fire these two weapons simultaneously in a spin-jump circular fire pattern that hit enemies on all sides: however, being hit while doing so results in the player losing both of their weapons. The player can also lock their character's mobility, allowing the player to shoot at all eight possible directions (including downwards and at angles) without moving or jumping. Finally, the player's default gun now has autofire capability (as a result, the Machine Gun from previous installments is gone).

It is the only installment in the Contra series that was released for Sega's platform.<br/><br/>Set five years after the events of Contra III: The Alien Wars, an elite team of commandos called the &quot;Unified Military Special Mobile Task Force K-X&quot;, also known as the &quot;Contra Hard Corps&quot;, has been assembled to combat the rapid spread of crime and illegal activities following the war. When an unknown hacker infiltrates the city's security system and reprograms a group of unmanned robots to cause havoc, the Hard Corps are deployed to handle the situation. As the game progresses, the player will uncover a plot involving Colonel Bahamut, a former war hero, who seeks to overthrow the Government by developing new types of weapon using a stolen alien cell.<br/><br/>The multiple weapon system from Contra III has been revamped. The player can now carry up to four different weapons, as well as a supply of bombs. Like in previous games, weapons are obtained from flying capsule pods. This time the weapon items are now labeled &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;D&quot;, which will vary depending on the character controlled by the player. Each player begins with a standard semi-automatic machine gun, which will be replaced by the character's A-type weapon whenever it's picked. When the player loses a life, their current weapon will be lost. Unlike Contra III, the player's supply of bombs will remain the same when a life is lost.<br/><br/>Another unique feature to Contra: Hard Corps is the addition of branching paths that allows the player to play through a different set of stages depending on key decisions made during key moments of the game's story. There are four possible paths in the game, each with its own ending, as well as hidden bonus stage for a total of five different endings.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Contra:_Hard_Corps,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "72384": {"poll": [], "name": "Contra: Legacy of War", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["EU Playstation version", "US Playstation version", "US Sega Saturn version"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic735929.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Contra"], "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "7", "videogamedeveloper": ["Novotrade"], "videogamegenre": ["Run-and-gun"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation", "SEGA Saturn"], "average": "5.42857", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Konami"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic735929_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Contra: Legacy of War is a 3D action game produced by Konami and developed by Appaloosa Interactive that was originally released in 1996 for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. It was the first of two Contra games that were externally developed by Appaloosa, followed by C: The Contra Adventure in 1998. The game marks the series' jump to three-dimensional graphics and controversial changes in gameplay. Legacy of War was released packaged with a pair of 3D anaglyph glasses, which the game supported. Legacy of War bears the distinction for being the first console game in the series to retain the Contra title and human characters during its release in the PAL region (where the series has been known as Probotector from the first NES game and up until Contra: Hard Corps). The game was scheduled to be released in Japan as well, but was canceled.<br/><br/>Colonel Bassad, a dictator of a small country, has managed to buy off a stolen alien embryo and is now using it to breed an army of fierce alien mutants. Moreover, it is rumored that Bassad has allied himself with an unknown alien entity for his bid to world domination. Ray Poward (returning from Contra: Hard Corps) is deployed to thwart Bassad's scheme along with three of the newest members of the Hard Corps team: Tasha, a female mercenary; CD-288, a robot; and Bubba, an alien.<br/><br/>Each character plays exactly the same except for the type of weapons they yield and their movement speed. All characters start with a machine gun and flamethrower, but the remaining two slots are for player specific weaponry. The game plays from an isometric angle. Since the game takes place in three dimensions, enemies come from all angles. Ducking and strafing have been added to the player's abilities, as well as an auto-aiming feature to help attack airborne enemies. Jumping has been slightly changed as the characters no longer do tightly curled somersault jumps (a feature in every previous game since the arcade version of the original Contra). The game no longer uses a system of lives, it uses a hit point meter instead.

I love the ideas of honor and loyalty and the conflict of human emotions in extreme conditions. Grace under pressure.<br/><br/>A long time ago, I designed a game about samurai. You may have heard of it. This game is a little different. That was a game about fantastic samurai. This is a game about samurai tragedy, both historical and fantastical.<br/><br/>Now, before we go any further, I&rsquo;ve got to say something right up front. This is not a history book. It is also not a reference book. There are plenty of books available to you if you want to know more about Japan. Even some great gaming books. Look at Gurps: Japan, for example. Also, Sengoku. And, of course, if you&rsquo;re looking for something really fantastic, go check out that Legend of the Five Rings book everybody&rsquo;s been talking about.<br/><br/>The purpose of this book is to provide rules for playing samurai in Old Japan, not give you a detailed essay on samurai culture, etiquette and history. I am not a historian nor am I an anthropologist. I&rsquo;m a game designer. I&rsquo;ll give you a ton of references at the end of this book to learn more about samurai and their world. Those sources are a lot more reliable than an amateur like myself.<br/><br/>Also, I&rsquo;ve taken a few liberties with &quot;historic&quot; Japan and I ask all you purists for forgiveness. I&rsquo;ve done so to make the game a bit more accessible to a Western audience--and frankly--to downplay a few of the more ugly aspects of Feudal Japan. I&rsquo;m not picking on the culture specifically: I can demonstrate a whole lot of ugliness in Feudal Europe as well. (And, when given the chance, I did the same thing to Restoration Europe by editing out the uglier aspects of my own ancestors&rsquo; history.) Despite my changes, I hope readers find my version of Old Japan retains its authenticity even if it sacrifices a bit of its historical accuracy.<br/><br/>This is a game about warring Clans. In samurai literature, the heroes are fragile. Always four feet from death. They die to serve the Clan. Every decision a samurai makes is about his Clan. To reflect that attitude, you&rsquo;ll find characters in this game are just like their literary counterparts: they are fragile. Don&rsquo;t get into a fight unless you know you can win. Also, the mechanics reflect the sentiment that the characters are all bit parts in a much larger machine. Identity is almost smothered by duty. Not entirely- and certainly less than if this was a historical game- but players will find that their characters are truly tiny parts of a larger machine. Your character&rsquo;s personal identity is far less important than his role in the Clan.<br/><br/>Character creation takes a few moments of consideration. Clan creation, on the other hand, is something the entire group should consider carefully.<br/><br/>Finally, a friendly warning.<br/><br/>Samurai literature is filled with stories of men and women forced to choose between love and duty, duty and honor, honor and honesty. These are the kinds of choices you will find in this game.

But the greatest terror of the Well is not what guards it, but what they are protecting -- the cremated remains of Shae Mora, the dreaded and legendary vampire dragon who once terrorized an entire Empire.<br/>Now, the secret of what transformed the Well to its current state is about to be revealed. Sammael Mezias Craven, a dark wizard of vast power and endless ambition, has uncovered an artifact that will allow him to take control of Shae Mora's liquid remains, the Blood Ice, which legend states still holds potent remains of her vast power. If he is not stopped, Craven's actions will bring terror and destruction to the surrounding lands, and perhaps the world at large.

Players assume the role of alien species competing to abduct and control Earthlings. Cards represent Earthlings (human and otherwise). Cards in a player's hand are Earthlings that have been previously abducted, and can now be activated by their alien overlords to do nefarious tasks - most frequently abducting more Earthlings. Cards face-down at various locations on the table represent Earthlings to be abducted. The face-down stacks at each location are built up by players during the course of the game; thus each player potentially has some knowledge about what types of Earthlings are at each location, which is where memory becomes involved.<br/><br/>Players move their spaceship tokens from location to location, abducting Earthlings (moving some of the face-down cards away from the location), and then fly back to their homeworlds to score them. Some Earthlings cause trouble when they are abducted (damaging the spaceship), while other may offer benefits while they are aboard. Players can also directly and indirectly attack other players' spaceships, to either prevent them from completing their abduction goals or sometimes to steal dangerous Earthlings without suffering the consequences.<br/><br/>Players win by successfully abducting 10 Earthlings and returning them to their homeworld. Each player also has a secret objective which allows them to win with a smaller number of Earthlings, such as six of the same species or 7 of the same gender.<br/><br/>Earthling Abductor: Deluxe Edition contains 68 Earthling cards, 7 Alien races, and 6 plastic space-ships.

You begin the game as a freed prisoner in Vvardenfell with no identity, so you can feel free to create any character that you can imagine.  Do you want to be a treasure-hunting pirate?  How about a noble knight upholding the law?  Or maybe a charming thief is more your style?  The sky's the limit when it comes to how you decide to put together your character.<br/><br/>While the main story centers around the deity Dagoth Ur, who seeks to grow in power to overthrow the Imperial reign in Morrowind, the main plot often times takes a backseat to the exploring and questing that you can do in each town, cave, and part of the countryside that you find.
