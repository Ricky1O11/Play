Each player controls a group of Rangers, who are working on nature and industry projects in Australia during the 1920s. The game board shows 6 states, which are divided into 24 land or water regions. Every region contains a face down industrial counter and a face up nature counter. On the borders, you find bases (camps or ships), where the players place their Ranger pieces to score points. At the beginning, every player receives a number of Rangers, which he keeps on his own player board, a plane, and two cards. The back of a card shows how many Rangers you can place in a base and how many dollars you receive. The front of a card shows the region where this base should border on.<br/><br/>The active player must perform two actions from the following three possibilities:<br/>1) A player may fly his plane to a region and turn up an industry counter (if available). <br/>2) A player may play a card to collect money and/or place Rangers in one base. Should this card have the same color as the region where his plane is, placement is free. Otherwise, a fee of $3 is collected from the player.<br/>3) A player may remove up to four Rangers from the game board back to his or her supply. <br/>Note: A special move is allowed to move any Ranger on the board for a cost of $4.<br/><br/>You score points by completing nature or industrial projects. Nature projects are completed as soon as the last free base in this region contains at least 1 Ranger. The player who completes the project receives 3 bonus points. Every player with Rangers in a base in this region receives 1 point for every Ranger (2 points for Rangers on a ship base). Industrial projects are completed as soon as the industry counter is turned over and the surrounding bases contain the required number of Rangers. These projects also provide 3 bonus points and 1 point per Ranger (2 points for Rangers on a ship base). Points are registered on a scoring track. At the end of the game, each dollar is an extra victory point.<br/><br/>The game ends when all card piles are exhausted and at least one player has played his last card. The players add their remaining dollars to their scores. The player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>Note: the English rules for the basic game may have an errata. It says draw 9 cards to make stacks, when the non-English rules say draw 8 cards, and the Advanced English rules say draw 9 instead of 8 cards.<br/><br/>Advanced rules<br/><br/>A windmill is introduced. When an industry counter with a windmill symbol is turned over, the windmill moves to another region and will add 1 point to its value. Whenever a region is scored, the nature or industry counter is placed on a windmill track. When the windmill track is filled, a windmill scoring round takes place. To score at the windmill, players need to place Rangers on a special Ranger track (instead of placing them in a base, as they normally would do). The player with the most Rangers on the Ranger track receives the value of the windmill in victory points. The second place receives half, the third place receives half of the second place. After the windmill scoring round, the counters on the windmill are removed and the players have to take half of their Rangers on the Ranger track back. Several windmill scoring rounds are possible. At the end of the game, an extra windmill scoring round takes place.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"32660": "International Edition"}, "average": "6.50899", "name": "Australia", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "age": "10", "usersrated": "1301", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"10167": "Country: Australia"}}, "15034": {"boardgamedesigner": {"4635": {"name": "John A.

The map scale is 1.7 kilometers per hex. The game lasts 12 turns that evidently equate to days. Units are companies and armored platoons for the U.S./ROK, mostly battalions for North Korea (whose army the rulebook consistently calls by its Korean name, &quot;In Min Gun&quot; or &quot;IMG&quot;). Higher level headquarters units implement the game's (rather restrictive and cumbersome) command rules.<br/><br/>The components are typical of Simulations Canada: an unattractive but functional four-color map, simple counters and a small, tightly printed rulebook. U.S. Marine and Army counters are shades of green, South Korean shades of red, North Korean a uniform brown. Counters are one-sided, with the back giving setup or arrival information for the historical scenarios.<br/><br/>The U.S./ROK side earns victory points by seizing objectives in and around Seoul, the enemy by inflicting casualties. As alternatives to the historical setup and reinforcement schedules, the U.S./ROK may use a free setup, or the IMG may receive more rapid reinforcements.<br/><br/>Game turns are divided into &quot;impulses&quot;, a concept borrowed from White Death, a Frank Chadwick design. In each of its impulses, a side may use all or some of its 9 &quot;movement points&quot; (but always at least one). The impulses alternate until all movement points are exhausted or neither player wants to do anything further that turn. The system is attractive in principle but may bog down in practice. It also requires record keeping, as air, naval and artillery units may bombard only once per turn rather than once per impulse.<br/><br/>Although all units have the same 9 movement points, how far they in fact can go differs by type - tracked vehicle, foot, support (wheeled vehicle) or &quot;irregular&quot; - and by morale class. If, for instance, a player divides his turn into three impulses, an &quot;A&quot; class armored platoon can potentially move 45 hexes along a road, while &quot;C&quot; class infantry company could advance 9 at most. Higher class units are also less likely to break in combat and can operate effectively at a greater distance from their HQ's. Out-of-supply units are slowed down. Those suppressed by bombardment may not move at all.<br/><br/>According to the designer's notes, &quot;In the historic scenario most play-tests ended with the UN player getting most of his objectives, though about half the time he was not able to secure the Seoul capital hex in time. As a result the game usually turned on how high a casualty level was sustained to get these objectives. . . . In the various Free UN landing and Rapid IMG reinforcement scenarios playtests indicated just about anything could happen.&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"109418": "Simulations Canada First Edition"}, "average": "5.82143", "name": "Inchon", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "7", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"40127": "Cities: Incheon"}}, "15045": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic68709.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"442": {"name": "Rob Daviau"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2005", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": {"51": {"name": "Hasbro"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic68709_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1064": {"name": "Movies / TV / Radio theme"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"9286": "2005 \u00c5rets Spill Best Strategy Game Nominee"}, "description": "A year has passed since the start of the Clone Wars on Geonosis.

The deck has 32 cards - like a modern Skat deck - but uses German suits (Bells, Hearts, Leaves, Acorns).<br/><br/>The Game<br/><br/>Ulti is a trick-taking game for three players. In each hand the player who wins the bidding chooses trumps (or no trumps) and plays alone against the other two players in partnership.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt 10 cards. The start player is allowed to look at and swap with the two cards left over (called a Talon). Once they have done this they must make a bid. Each player in turn can choose to look at the Talon and swap cards with it but if they do they must make a bid which is of higher value than the previous one.<br/><br/>Numerous different value bids can be made. These range from winning the hand, taking the last trick with the seven of the trump suit (Ulti), loosing every trick (Betli) or winning every trick (Durchmars). The value of most of these bids can be doubled by playing the Heart suit as the trump card. If a player thinks the winning bid will not be successful he can make a bid saying this when he plays the first trick (called a Kontra). At the end of the hand, if he is correct he will get double points (or money if playing for money.)<br/><br/>Once the bid has been finalized the players play out the tricks. When the tricks have been finished the players see if the bid was successful. If the bid was successful the losing players give the winner the value of the bid (points or money). If the bid was unsuccessful the loser gives the other two players the value of the bid.

Instead of rolling dice, players are dealt cards with poker hands on them.  Examples:  Jack-high hand, a pair of sevens, four queens.  There are no straights, flushes, or full houses, only a specified card and the number of copies of that card in the hand.  Each player is dealt the same number of cards (1 - 7).  Players then bid on the combined hands of all players.  A player that bids seven kings is betting that there will be seven or more kings total in everyone's hands.  To bid, each player must bid either a higher number of matching cards, or the same number of a higher ranked cards.  (So, to overbid seven kings, bid seven aces, or eight or more of anything.)  When players think someone has bid more than the cards will support, they call &quot;liar&quot;.  Once everyone around the table has called &quot;liar&quot; rather than keep bidding, the cards are shown.  If someone is called a liar, but the cards prove him right, he wins the pot of chips accumulated during the bidding.

GUNS! Artillery pieces. Anti-tank guns. The famous and deadly German &quot;88&quot;. Mortars and bazookas! ASLSK#2 adds the &quot;to hit&quot; procedure to the foundation you learned in ASLSK#1. And if you didn't get ASLSK#1? There are two &quot;infantry only&quot; scenarios to get you up to speed!<br/><br/>This answers the inevitable question we get with the Starter Kit concept. Do I need ASLSK#2 if I have ASLSK#1? The Starter Kits are self contained. Each has everything you need to play what's in the box, with the higher numbers adding to the ASL knowledge you'll have from playing previous Starter Kits. We do not anticipate changing what you've learned from prior Starter Kits (for example, ASLSK#2 adds about 4 pages of rules to the base built by ASLSK#1). A better question would be &quot;Do I need ASLSK#1 if I buy ASLSK#2?&quot;. The short answer is a resounding no! You can dive right in with ASLSK#2. But if you do, and you like the game, ASLSK#1 adds more boards and scenarios (infantry only) for you to enjoy.

This was a clash between numbers of weapon-systems. The English had mostly bill and bow, though their light cavalry (the moss troopers) used a small crossbow called a latch. The Scots had changed over to the pike and were well supplied with cannon. I have assumed the Highland formations were not pike armed but used the more traditional sword and axe.           <br/>           <br/>The battle was one of the last with a medieval format of a small number of large &ldquo;battles&rdquo; &ndash; six a side at Flodden. These units manoeuvre on a map of the area around Flodden hill from which the Scots descended. The counters representing the bands of men are stored on Arrays which are displays that resemble a plan view of the unit counter. You will typically put the best bands at the front, and will also consider whether to put bows in the front line or in the rear.           <br/>           <br/>The combat system models the degradation of combat effectiveness as losses and morale reductions take a toll. However, just because the less experienced men at the back of the unit are unhappy does not mean that the unit will break. The key individual captains and &ldquo;Big Men&rdquo; of the front-line units must be defeated. When a unit snaps the entire unit will rout.           <br/>           <br/>The order system models the difficulty of controlling large bodies without radios.

The game contains 86 numbered vegetable cards (6 sorts) and 24 action cards. Each player starts with 8 random vegetable cards and a identical set of 4 different action cards. The first player announces the current vegetable (for example &ldquo;carrot&rdquo;) and plays one of his cards face down (which doesn&rsquo;t need to be a carrot!). The next player has two options. He can play a face down card and announce the current vegetable (he says &ldquo;carrot&rdquo;, but also doesn&rsquo;t need to play one). Or he can doubt the card of the previous player. In the latter case he looks at the previous card. If the previous player has lied (he did not play a &ldquo;carrot&rdquo;), that player has to draw a number of cards. If the previous player did not lie, the doubting player has to draw the cards. It is possible to play an action card in stead of a vegetable card. With an action card you can change the direction of the game, change the current vegetable or force a player to draw extra cards. The game ends when a player has emptied his hand or when the draw pile is exhausted for the second time. Remaining hand cards are penalty points.

The players create armies of different sizes and nationalities and must use all of the skill and knowledge of strategy they possess to defeat their opponents. Rules are provided on how to play the games, but these can be looked upon as guidelines. It will constantly be stressed that this is your system and the rules can be altered to suit your particular style of play. The games can be played as simple or complicated as you prefer. Because of the endless variety of combat situations which can be constructed, we hope players will never tire of the system.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We offer 5 books within the system, each one covering 300 weapons. There are 2 aircraft books, 2 naval books and 1 armor book. This means a total of 1,500 weapons are covered. A total of over 1,000,000 of these weapons were produced and we provide production figures for all of them. Our playing pieces are larger than those offered by other gaming companies and are presented in a variety of shapes which look like the weapons they have been chosen to represent. Our playing pieces are available in four different 4 color camouflage patterns. A national insignia sheet is also available in full color and contains over 500 insignias from over a dozen countries. When applied to the playing pieces, these insignias combined with the size, shape and camouflage patterns provide an air of realism and excitement never before attainable at the price they are offered.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Because of the larger size of our playing pieces, it stands to reason our hexes must be larger to accommodate them. In keeping with our policy of non-restriction, a stencil is available within our system which allows the player to trace this hex pattern across any playing surface they choose. A readily available and inexpensive playing surface is poster board (22&quot; x 28&quot;). Two of these boards butted together make a good beginner size and three boards make a good overall size for any type of gaming activity. These boards can be left plain, or full color scenarios can be drawn on them prior to tracing the hex pattern. Even those players with limited artistic ability can create personalized scenarios with a little time and patience. Maps can be purchased of oceans, continents and individual countries. These maps are relatively inexpensive, are good size for gaming and make for an extremely attractive playing surface. County survey maps can also be acquired, as well as city and county street indexes for those who wish to engage in street fighting. A hex pattern sheet is also provided with our stencil which can be inexpensively reprinted at your local quickie printer.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;A map or scenario can also be applied to a window shade and our design traced across it. The shade can be stretched across the playing area and retained at the ends while in use. For those with a permanent playing table, shade brackets can be attached to one edge of the table and the shade snapped in. The pull tab can be retained at the opposite edge with the aid of a nail. In this way the shade will rest squarely on the table top and remain taut. A variety of shades can be prepared and used as they are needed. This should be especially appealing for clubs. Games can also be played on non-hex surfaces by simply substituting inches for hex speed, which is contained in the WARGAME CHARTS. Remember, we will recommend how the games should be played, but the final decision is up to you.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "15199": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Corporation", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "3", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic72789_t.jpg", "average": "3.33333", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3455": {"name": "GLS"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic72789.jpg", "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "The object of this game of international trade is to be the first player to build a corporate headquarters on each continent.

Each time a double of a house already on fire is rolled, a block from that building is removed.<br/><br/>To put out a fire, both spaces in front of a building must be occupied by a fire engine.

Each player also receives 10 chips to use as money.<br/><br/>The dealer draws the top 4 cards from the blue deck and they are paired up their duplicates from the player's red cards and removed from the game.

The game includes a map stretching from the Pyrenees to Moscow, and from Norway to the Sudan, covering every square inch of territory in Europe and the Near East which saw combat from 1914 to 1918, in a manageable 22x17 format. An additional map shows the German colonies<br/><br/>The game also features 308 beautifully-illustrated counters depicting the national armies that fought in the war -- from the Germans, French, British and Russians all the way down to the Persians, Montenegrins, Armenians, South Africans, and a host of other specialized units (French Foreign Legion, Gurkhas, Italian &quot;Arditi&quot;, Cossacks, Tyrolean Kaiserjaeger, Zionists, Bavarians, &quot;Dunsterforce&quot;... even the Chinese may send a small expeditionary force).<br/><br/>DEATH IN THE TRENCHES includes a deceptively simple twelve pages of rules (and an additional twelve pages of random events) detailing the game's unique combat system (no CRT!) which portrays the grinding nature of World War I combat in a realistic way that still gives players plenty of options to pursue. Using army-level units (which contain numbers of divisional level formations, represented off-map), players use numerous special military abilities to drive back the enemy.<br/><br/>Detailed random events rules give you more gory details about World War I than you've ever seen before in a game, while helping keep play simple and straightforward. Lenin, the Senussi revolt, intrigue in the Romanian court, the Cruise of the Emden, the Armenian Massacre, the Sinai Pipeline, the Ukrainian Reactionary Hetmanate, Rasputin, Mata Hari, the Russian shell shortage, the murder of Edith Cavell, Wilhelm Wassmuss (the &quot;German Lawrence&quot;), Lawrence of Arabia, the Nestorian resistance, Pancho Villa, the Grand Duke Nicholas, Thomas Masaryk, the Red Baron, Czech Legion, Irish Rising, Berber Revolt, air raids, typhus, influenza... they're all here.<br/><br/>For the World War I buff, &quot;DITT&quot; has everything: Tanks, Alpenkorps, artillery barrages, flamethrowers, poison gas, Krupp guns, Mustapha Kemal, the Royal Air Force, French elan... while the great wartime leaders all leave their mark (good or bad!) on history: Bruchmuller, Haig, Hoffmann, Mackensen, Hindenburg and Ludendorff, Rennenkampf and Samsonov, Sarrail, Von Francois, Foch, Brusilov, Nivelle, Plehve, Putnik, Yudenich... they're all here. Players command the armed forces of nearly forty nations, in a game that still manages to be small enough to fit on your table!<br/><br/>It sounds like a massive game, but it isn't. DEATH IN THE TRENCHES is designed to be played--easy to play, hard to master. You'll learn things about World War I you never knew before, and you'll have to face the same crises the leaders of the Entente and Central Powers did.

You'll find Ali, Marciano, Dempsey, Louis, Tunney, Foreman, Frazier, Baer, Braddock and more.To quote the designer of the game, Dr. Julian Compton, from a Data Boxing Newsletter (in 1977), &quot;One of the real thrills for this game player is to see the stars of the past come alive in a game structure. Usually these names will be familiar, but ever so often an unknown will rear his head in a bid for greatness.&quot;<br/><br/>Data Boxing is &quot;the boxer's Boxing Game&quot;. It's a detailed, realistic simulation of boxing where boxers of all eras are matched.  There is a real component to it because it's based on the actual performance of boxers. Individual fighters are rated on cards, and bouts are resolved through dice and charts and/or rounds cards (see Data Boxing II below).<br/><br/>Data Boxing is based on decades of study and research. It began as a research project in 1967 by humanities professor and boxing authority, Dr. Julian Compton (1940-2010). The heavyweights were evaluated on up to 155 variables. The table game first appeared in 1976. The computerized version was first released in 2004 which is set up similarly to the board game. The computer implementation was done by NASA programmer Don Mankowski.  Data Boxing was featured in the December 1977 edition of Ring Magazine, The People's Almanac [1978], Computer Sports Match-ups [1981] and in the December 13th, 2006 issue of the Tallahassee Democrat.<br/><br/>"}, "15404": {"boardgamedesigner": {"4721": {"name": "T.

If you roll a 1-4, you place the number of grubs indicated into your tree stump and press down the plunger. The dough is mashed and forced out the base in a continuous worm shape over the track. You attach a wheeled worm head to the tip of the dough and add side wheels as needed to support your worm's body. Thus the worms get longer and longer as the race progresses. If you roll a Mr. Chomp, you take a bird shaped device, chomp off the head of your opponent's worm, then place the chomped segment into your tree stump to move your worm ahead. Your opponent must then reattach the plastic worm head to the remainder of his or her worm segment.<br/><br/>The first player whose worm grows the entire length of the track, crosses the finish line, and takes the checkered flag is the winner.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"179097": "Italian Edition"}, "name": "Go!

The winner of the last turn is the winner of the entire game.<br/><br/><br/>The different minigames<br/><br/><br/>Gatloppet (The Gauntlet)<br/><br/>In the Gauntlet the challenger tries to outwit the gladiator, while the gladiator tries to predict the challenger's next move. The challenger starts the game by picking cards of two different types. They then play one card at a time, the gladiator trying to match them. The challenger gets to move forward every time the gladiator fails to predict which card the challenger played. If the challenger gets to the finish line before running out of cards, they have won the round and get points depending on how many cards they have left in hand.<br/><br/>Duellen (The Duel, orig. Joust)<br/><br/>The Duel is a card based color matching game where the players simultaneously try to build ladders by combining cards with the same colored symbols on them. The game ends when one player can't continue their ladder. Points are awarded depending on how many cards are left in the player's hand, less than 5 yielding the maximum score. The challenger won't get any points if the gladiator finishes their ladder first.<br/><br/>Ringarna (The Rings, orig. Hang Tough)<br/><br/>The Rings is a tactical challenge played out in six turns. The challenger must move over to the gladiator's space or reach one of the eight scoring squares by playing movement cards. The gladiator's role is to catch the challenger by ending up on their space or to prevent them from reaching the score tiles by blocking their path.<br/><br/>V&auml;ggen (The Wall)<br/><br/>In the Wall the challenger tries to reach the top before time runs out or the gladiator catches them. It is played out over seven rounds. In each round the challenger calls out how many spaces they want to move in that turn. They then spin a spinner numbered 1 to 12. The challenger gets to move if the spinner shows the same number or higher. In round 4 the gladiator takes up the chase following the same movement rules but using the gladiator's spinner numbered 4 to 15. The minigame ends after seven rounds or after the challenger has either been caught or reached the top.<br/><br/>Rekylen (Recoil, orig. Snapback)<br/><br/>In Recoil the challenger tries to steal markers from the game board by moving their piece to the desired color. To accomplish this they must have the correct colored card in their hand. If they don't they can chose to play the card turned face down and spin the spinner to try to get the correct color. The gladiator then tries to respond with the same colored card or by spinning the spinner to the same color in order to protect the marker. The minigame is over when the gladiator has played all of their cards.<br/><br/>Attackboll (Attack Ball, orig. Powerball)<br/><br/>In Powerball the challenger tries to place cardboard chits in the receiver by balancing them on a cardboard &quot;spoon&quot;. The gladiator has a slightly larger &quot;spoon&quot; with which they try to block the challenger. The minigame ends when the time runs out.<br/><br/>Hinderbanan (The Obstacle Course, orig. The Eliminator)<br/><br/>The Obstacle Course is the final minigame, the winner takes it all. Players take turns trying to match symbols on a track by turning over cardboard tokens, a bit like Memory. The player with the most points from previous minigames starts and gets a number of markers equal to the difference between the players' scores. That player gets to keep turning over tokens until they fail. If they fail and have no markers remaining, the next player gets to start turning over pieces to try to match their symbols. If they do have any markers, they discard one and keep turning over tokens until they are out of markers. The player who first matches all of their symbols wins the entire game.<br/><br/>"}, "15459": {"boardgamedesigner": {"36553": {"name": "M\u00e5ns Gahrton"}}, "average": "5", "poll": {}, "name": "Eva & Adam", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2073": "Acting"}, "yearpublished": "2002", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic64103_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"36554": "Johan Unenge"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"404": {"name": "Alga"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic64103.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"80659": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "This game of &quot;life, buddies and love&quot; very loosely ties into a Swedish comic of the same name aimed at pre-teens.
