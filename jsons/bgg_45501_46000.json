Aye, enough to fill several volumes &mdash; or a lifetime.&quot;<br/>&mdash; From the journals of Duke Avan Astran of Vilmir<br/><br/>Twenty thousand years ago Grome and Straasha waged a mighty war. In the wake of their struggles continents would rise and oceans were formed. The battle fields were strewn with islands and small seas. Thus the world was shaped.<br/><br/>Twelve thousand years ago the Melnibone people rose up waged a bloody civil war against their Menastrai brothers. These break away followers of Chaos slaughtered the Menastrai forces and laid siege to their capitol city. The Menastrai were faced with certain destruction and subjugation at the hands of their enemy. But when all seemed lost, they summoned up ancient sorceries and fled beyond the Ragged Pillars into the Unknown East. When the gates fell, the Chaotic warriors entered an empty city. Their foes had vanished. The city was lotted, burned to the ground, and forgotten.<br/><br/>In the East, the followers of Balance once again rebuilt their magnificent cities and beautiful kingdoms. Their priests sang cities into existence, and all but the most benevolent of magics faded into history. The Menastrai forgot the arts of war and lived in peace with all those around them. 6000 years of peace and prosperity passed.<br/><br/>Then their old enemies, Melnibon&eacute; found them again. Dragon venom, sword, and the corrupted magic slaughtered millions of peace loving people in an effort to stamp out the dreams of Balance once and for all. Shimmering cities were reduced to rubble. The Menastrai surrendered and accepted Melnibon&eacute;an Rule, while secretly worshipping the Balance. The Bright Empire looted the land, and set up a government to bleed the Eastern Lands of their riches. The Menastrai people waited for Balance to re-assert itself.<br/><br/>When the Dharzi rose up and began defeating the Melnibon&eacute;ans at their own game, the Bright Empire hurriedly brought it's troops home to Melnibon&eacute; to fend off the Dharzi forces. One by one the Young Kingdoms found themselves unoccupied and independent. In the six hundred years that have now passed, the Eastern Lands once again prosper under the powers of Balance. Once again, they live in peace out of sight from the Western world.<br/><br/>THE UNKNOWN EAST provides clues and details for that area of the Northern Continent dubbed The Unmapped East.

We cannot change what is done, we can only change what happens next.&quot; - Mountainshadow, the Far Scholar<br/><br/>This is the Book of Dragons for the Earthdawn Role Playing Game. Inside, the Great Dragons of Barsaive are detailed, as well as other influential adult dragons. The Book of Dragons contains all the rules necessary for including dragons, in all their might and majesty, as well as dragon-like creatures in your Earthdawn campaign. Finally, the Book of Dragons' adventure frameworks can immediately involve your campaign in the affairs of dragons.<br/><br/>"}, "45602": {"rpgdesigner": ["Shannon Appelcline", "Bill Filios", "Kenneth Hite", "Donald Kubasak", "Adam Thornton", "John Tuckey"], "rpg": ["Nephilim (English RPG)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Chronicle of the Awakenings", "rpgartist": ["John Bridges", "Sam Shirley"], "usersrated": "5", "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic504608.jpg", "rpgmechanic": ["Attribute/Stat Based (STR, CON, PER, etc)", "Dice (Percentile)", "Skill Based (buy or gain skills)"], "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover version"], "average": "7.9", "rpgissuearticle": ["Anmeldelser"], "rpggenre": ["Crime (Conspiracy)", "Fantasy (Modern Urban Fantasy)", "Occult (Symbolism / Tarot)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Chaosium"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic504608_t.jpg", "description": "Resources for the Nephilim players and gamemasters, such as: new past lives, new Metamorphosis (and a new system based on emotions) and new simulacra.<br/><br/>"}, "45603": {"rpgartist": ["John Bridges", "Kerie Campbell", "Mark Ryberg", "Sam Shirley"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing"], "statistics": [], "name": "Secret Societies", "rpgdesigner": ["Kenneth Hite"], "usersrated": "6", "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic504624.jpg", "rpgmechanic": ["Attribute/Stat Based (STR, CON, PER, etc)", "Dice (Percentile)", "Skill Based (buy or gain skills)"], "average": "7.16667", "rpgissuearticle": ["Games Reviews"], "rpggenre": ["Crime (Conspiracy)", "Fantasy (Modern Urban Fantasy)", "Occult (Symbolism / Tarot)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Chaosium"], "rpg": ["Nephilim (English RPG)"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic504624_t.jpg", "description": "This sourcebook is for the Nephilim gamemaster to use in devising suitable antagonists for the players.

But beneath Throal's stable suface, turmoil and political intrigue are simmering. Driven by ancient grudges and personal ambition, enemies of King Varulus lay dark plots for a future under a new ruler.

I know this for a fact as I am Uatu the Watcher and I am an observer of such realities. My main purview is what you know as the MARVEL UNIVERSE in all its diverse wonders.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The changes wrought by time are more startling than initially conceivable, but all will be explained. I have seen this seemingly insignificant planet rife with Celestial activity far beyond any within this quadrant of the galaxy. I have witnessed the rise of Eternals and Deviants far more powerful than any others, and noticed with interest the visitations of the extraterrestrial Kree and their gestation of those who would later be called Inhumans. Human civilizations rose and fell, as did the Deviant civilization on Lemuria and the human on Atlantis in the second coming of the Celestials. This azure planet attained the great interest of the Watchers before its native human population discovered the most rudimentary forms of writing.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;All this I have observed and more, as I peered into alternate timelines, where the smallest event can change an entire reality. Throughout the history of the mortal heroes called Avengers, small events have become part of legend. The mere passage of the emerald behemoth known as the Hulk over a western railroad and his manipulation by Loki ultimately gave birth to the mightiest team of heroes on Earth&mdash;the Avengers! &ldquo;A temper tantrum of the Sub-Mariner led to the rebirth of the living legend of Captain America! In the search for errors in his artificially intelligent robot, Henry Pym gave birth to the great danger called Ultron! All these small events led to greater legends and acts of heroism unparalleled. Read on, for here are the epics kept on those who respond to a call heard from Earth's core to the halls of Asgard: &lsquo;AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!'&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This is Captain America, and this is our basic orientation booklet for all new Avengers. Everything within this book is information to acclimate new members to their new role in their upcoming tours of duty with the team.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Only after passing all the security and background checks do applicants receive a Communicard and this booklet to read. The first topic is the Avengers' place among the varied power groups on Earth, especially contacts and involvement with other superhuman crime-fighting groups. Next are the Charter and By-Laws. Read them carefully. The Chairbeing and fellow Avengers will answer any questions about operating procedures. This also booklet contains the current membership roster as well as some excerpts from the files of the active membership of the Avengers. The last piece of instructional material describes the various villains the Avengers have faced in the past. We Avengers have found a need to keep all our members updated on the tactics and tricks of villains we encounter, as they tend to return, often spoiling for a fight. With this information, newer members benefit from the wealth of experience the Avengers membership holds. Finally, we have included a personal piece from the only person to have stayed with the team from Day One, Edwin Jarvis. Though the membership is constantly changing and new and old Avengers come and go, this man is the only one of us who truly cannot be replaced.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I wish good luck to all new Avengers, and may they find the steadfast camaraderie and loyalty that I have among fellow Avengers. This is a unique collection of beings, and one that all of us are proud to be a part of. Keep 'em Flying!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;In the time since I was revived, there has been no greater collection of heroes and friends than the Avengers. Over the years, I have attempted to mold the Avengers into the most efficient superhuman peacekeeping force in the world. During these times, we have come into contact with many of Earth's other superhumans, whether as friend or foe. The following file is a list of the superhuman community in their particular groups and how the Avengers work with them or against them for the benefit of the entire planet.

The game is a demo version of the game, Devil's Due, Brice's Crossroads. This will allow you to test drive the Rebel Yell system in general and the upcoming game in particular, at no cost.<br/> Tha game is about one of the most lopsided victories in the war for the Confederates. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest was a threat to General Sherman's vulnerable and strung out supply line during his Georgia March to the Sea in 1864.<br/> A detachment of 8000 Union soldiers, a mix of cavalry &amp; infantry, were sent to eliminate Forrest's troops.<br/> The over eager young Union officer, Samuel Sturgis, sent his cavalry over 7 miles in front of his infantry.<br/> Forrest predicted the battle's outcome early that day to one of his generals. He stated that their Confederate cavalry would drive the Union cavalry back in a rout and push them into the tired Union infantry slogging their way towards the battlefield. His prediction was true as the Union cavalry quickly broke and retreated right back into the confused infantry. The infantry could not organize a stand in the panicked retreat of the horsemen. The Union troops were routed and suffered casualties that exceed the CSA losses by 3 to 1.<br/> In the end though, Forrest was not able to interfere with the supply line of Sherman's army, so in this, Sherman's goal was accomplished.<br/> This game comes with 2 scenarios, the simplified rules, 2 maps (in four pieces), counter images and needed charts.

A host of interesting and varied individuals surround the arachnid adventurer, many who would make wonderful pawns, and even a rook or two, in upcoming campaigns.

Play to the best of your abilities, and learn the lessons that will aid you in the future.<br/><br/>Study the entries in this log with patience and care, for human minds cannot guess when or where I, the Grandmaster of the Universe, shall require the services of your like again.

Many a story has been told of the lone private investigator, police detective, or con man who is a drunk, a chauvinist, or an opportunist. However, many of these characters still have morals and values to which they adhere, a code of honor that while not always pure, is at least admirable in some respect. These are the types of characters [that] seem more real because they are flawed and have human frailties, just like we all do.

It introduced several innovations to role-playing game design, being the first game to allow players to have non-humanoid roles, and the first to have detailed martial arts and skill systems. Fantasy Games Unlimited published a second printing of the game in 1982, and the game was modified and republished by Steve Jackson Games as an official GURPS supplement in 1992.<br/><br/>As rabbits, player characters are faced with dangers mirroring those in the real world.

You and your friends will also portray the loyal companions and grogs who stand with the magi, as a buffer between them and the mundane world that often misunderstands their power and motives.

The Fifth Edition won the Origins Award for Best Role Playing Game, the Gold ENnie for Best Rules, and the Out of the Box Award for Best Retread.

This place was once well known for its power-mongering warlords, magic-wielding sorcerers, and archfiends from the deepest pits of the Abyss. But in the last 600 years, this has changed. Tirna'cel is a peaceful and welcoming land now, due in no small part to the efforts of the warlord Tirna'gael, a member of the land's founding nobility.<br/><br/>Tirna'gael turned against the other rulers without warning, attacking and overwhelming them without remorse. He is said to have suddenly grown stronger and more powerful. The reasons for his remarkable gain in power are unknown, though they are routinely connected to items believed to have been entombed with him by the then-newly formed paladin's Order of Garadon.<br/><br/>After his death, Tirna'gael's body was interred in his central citadel, a large stone fortress suspended over an immense lava pit. There he has rested for nearly 600 years, protected by the surrounding hostile environmentand a small cadre of supernatural guardians summoned and permanently bound by the Order of Garadon.<br/><br/>But recently, rumors have reached the corridors of Tirna'cel's capital city that invaders have struck the fallen hero's burial place, in search of one or more of his legendary magic items. So far, all that is known of these foul creatures is that they are native to the environment, being resistant to the fiery dangers of the area.<br/><br/>Your party has been summoned by the lord of the realm, who has charged you with ending the threat to Tirna'gael's tomb and the potential destruction of the land's long-enduring peace. If the sources of Tirna'gael's power were to fall into the wrong hands, it could mean the end of the nation as you know it.<br/><br/>"}, "45976": {"rpgartist": ["Carl Frank", "Cristina McAllister"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing", "PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Crypt of St. Bethesda", "rpgdesigner": ["James Macduff"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic505432.jpg", "usersrated": "8", "rpgproducer": ["Mark Jelfo", "jim pinto"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Head-to-Head: Mini Adventures"], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG)"], "average": "4.875", "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Adventure Booster"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic505432_t.jpg", "description": "From the front cover:<br/><br/>Out of Body, Out of Mind is a d20 System adventure booster designed for 5-8 characters levels 2-4.
