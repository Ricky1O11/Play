The expansion pack was not a stand alone release and required the original game be installed first prior to use. Escalation introduced new maps, weapons, and vehicles to the original game while focusing on an escalation of the conflict in Indonesia to the rest of Southeast Asia. Players had the option to use parachutes to jump out of helicopters or from elevated map locations. The parachute deployed automatically after a player had fallen long enough to reach terminal velocity. The parachute could be steered, but with a response slower than normal movement. After a player landed, the parachute was expended and no longer operable unless the player went to an armory to pick up a new one. Players also had the option of carrying body armor. The body armor would not deflect rounds, but spread out their kinetic energy, reducing the penetrative force. Similar to the parachute, body armor added weight which slowed a player's speed on foot. To counter this, players also had the option of choosing what type of bullets they could use. FMJ (Full Metal Jacket) bullets were for general use. SP (Soft Point) bullets caused more damage to enemies but could be greatly reduced by body armor. Consequently, AP (Armor Piercing) bullets could pierce body armor but did not cause as much damage as the former choices.

There are multiple ways to play the game, multiple decks to build, and players can even make up rules once they get comfortable with the gameplay. The trading card and custom deck options are just that...options, and are not required to play the game, unless you want to, and that is always welcomed!<br/><br/>War Fighters can be played by anyone, of any age, at any time, in multiple ways, without having to spend hours on rules getting confusing.<br/><br/>Basic Game Play (#1):<br/>-Divide one deck in half evenly and give each half to a player.<br/>-Each player will receive:  5 square fighters (Paper), 5 circle fighters (Rock), 5 ex fighters (Scissors), 4 attacks, 2 blocks, 2 truces, and 2 star leader fighter cards for a total of 25 cards in the basic version of the game.<br/>-Each player shuffles their half decks<br/>-Each player puts their decks to the left as their &quot;draw pile.&quot;<br/>-Each player draws 5 cards.<br/>-At the same time, each player plays a fighter card in the play area between them.  A fighter card will have a symbol of a circle, square, ex, or star on it.<br/>-To determine who wins, Square beats Circle, Circle beats Ex, Ex beats Square, Star beats all.<br/>-If both players play the same cards (ex:  circle vs. circle) then &quot;war&quot; is initiated and each player draws 3 cards from the draw pile and places it face down into the play area, and then plays another fighter card for the win. War continues until someone wins.  Each time the same cards are played, war is initiated again.<br/>-The winner of each round gets all the cards in the play area and puts them into their &quot;discard pile&quot; to their right.<br/>-When the cards in the play area are the same, players must draw the 3 cards and lay them face down followed by another fighter card.  However, when the cards are different (ex:  circle vs. square) a player can then decide if they want to use an &quot;attack&quot; card, &quot;block&quot; card, or a &quot;truce&quot; card.<br/>-An &quot;attack&quot; card is basically a &quot;+1&quot; or &quot;one up&quot; to the other player for the win.<br/>-A &quot;truce&quot; card means you do not want to fight anymore and want your card back, so both players get their cards back.<br/>-A player can choose to &quot;block&quot; an &quot;attack&quot; card as a defense to try and win the round.  A &quot;truce&quot; card cannot be blocked in the basic version of the game.<br/>-After each round, each player draws back up to 5 cards for the next round.<br/>-Each player can use their full hand in each round as needed, but can only use one fighter card during a round, unless  &quot;war&quot; has been initiated and the three face down cards need to be drawn.<br/>-It takes one attack and one circle to beat a square, one attack and one square to beat an ex, and one attack and an ex to beat a  circle card.<br/>-If a star card is thrown, it takes two unblocked attacks plus any fighter card (square, circle, ex) to beat the star card<br/>-The objective of the game, or how to win, is to collect all the leader cards from the other player.<br/>-On a 5 card hand, if a player does not have any fighter cards, they must show the other player their hand to prove they are not cheating, hand over one of their cards, shuffle all their cards, and draw a new 5 card hand.<br/>-During war, if a player does not have a fighter card to finish the round, that player must count the number of cards in their hand, shuffle all their cards, and draw another hand with that number of cards.<br/><br/>Game Play #2 - (War Strategies):<br/>-During this game style, players can choose to use attack, defense, and truce cards in order raise the stakes before going to war and/or to cancel out the war.  So, when players use the same cards (Ex:  circle vs. circle), the attack, block, and truce cards can now be played.<br/><br/>Game Play #3 - (Aggressive Vs. Defensive):<br/>-In this style of play, one person gets all the attack cards to start with, while the other gets all the blocks and truce cards.<br/>-As an additional rule, one of the players can get the &quot;power&quot; card as well.<br/>-The &quot;power&quot; card acts as 2 attack cards.  When used as an attack card, if a player wins the round, the other player's fighter card is taken out of the game until it is over, making the game go even faster.  Star Leader cards cannot be taken out of the game since they are needed in order to win the game.<br/><br/>Game Play #4 - (Power Cards):<br/>-In this mode, the loser of the previous round gets to use the power card to help &quot;even the odds.&quot;<br/>-One power card comes in each box.<br/><br/>Game Play #5 - (Custom Deck Options):<br/>-In this option, players can play half decks, full decks, or customs decks, and build their own decks to battle with.<br/>-Players can choose if the cards are deck specific as well.  For example, if one person uses ninjas and the other uses pirates, the you can assume that pirates do not know how to throw ninja attack darts or stricken, and therefore the cards are no good to pirates and only the ninja cards the player acquires can use those attacks.  This option is a bit advanced so most players who play this tend to put the other players fighter cards to the side and use the attacks, blocks, truce, and power cards in a non-deck specific mode.<br/><br/>Extra Game Information:<br/>-This game is very open so players who are comfortable with the rules tend to master it and then make up their own rules for added fun.<br/>-All decks play the same, but have different artwork to cater to everyones passions.<br/>-This game can also be used to play &quot;matching games,&quot; where you lay cards face down and try to pair them up.<br/><br/>"}, "152030": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Alarums & Excursions (Issue 173 - Jan 1990)", "rpgproducer": {"13226": "Lee Gold"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1868671.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"1494": "Alarums & Excursions"}, "rpg": {"191": "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (1st Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"227565": "First Printing"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1868671_t.jpg", "description": "Alarums &amp; Excursions<br/>Issue #173<br/>January 1990<br/><br/>Cover art by Jonny McNair.<br/><br/>"}, "152032": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Alarums & Excursions (Issue 174 - Feb 1990)", "rpgproducer": {"13226": "Lee Gold"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1868672.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"1494": "Alarums & Excursions"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"159298": "Adventures in New France"}, "rpg": {"310": "Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"227574": "First Printing"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1868672_t.jpg", "description": "Alarums &amp; Excursions<br/>Issue #174<br/>February 1990<br/><br/>Cover art by Eric Yoon.<br/><br/>"}, "152034": {"rpg": {"22780": "Bulletproof Blues"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Bulletproof Blues Character Pack 001.01", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2366735.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"227576": "Bulletproof Blues Character Pack 001 PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"171": "Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"34252": "Bulletproof Blues Character Pack"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2366735_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>&quot;The Bulletproof Blues Character Pack 001 contains ten pieces of high resolution, royalty-free character artwork by Dan Houser, along with the characters&rsquo; Bulletproof Blues character sheets in PDF and Bulletproof Blues Character Sheet Helper format.

The landscape bristles with three divine energies. Every player action alters the balance of power among those energies, and thus the players collectively determine Lagoon&rsquo;s destiny. One divine energy shall inherit Lagoon, and the player who best served it wins!<br/><br/>The world is built using hexagonal tiles, and a new tile is drawn from a bag each time a druid explores a site. Site tiles are double-sided, and each side represents a different mystical site offering a unique magical power to the druids. Each site is also enchanted with one of three divine energies: Elemeen, Vowelon and Deonin. Since the two sides of a site tile are always linked to different energies, every site explored presents a choice of which energy to advance over the other two, as well as what magic will be put into the world for use by the druids. Players also strategically deploy their druids to unravel sites aligned with an energy they choose to oppose, removing such sites from the world and tipping the balance of power towards the other two energies.<br/><br/>The energy with the most sites in play at the end of the game becomes Lagoon's destiny, and the player who most supported that dominant energy is the winner. Support is tracked in two ways. First, whenever exploring a site and expanding an energy's reach in Lagoon, the exploring player gains a divine seed token matching the explored site's energy. These seeds can be spent in various ways over the course of the game, but any seeds of the dominant energy remaining in a player's supply at the end of the game are worth 1 point each. Secondly, whenever a player unravels a site, it is removed from play and placed in front of that player. At the end of the game, unraveled sites not matching the dominant energy are worth 2 points each.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"227595": "English first edition"}, "average": "6.54967", "name": "Lagoon: Land of Druids", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2676": "Grid Movement"}, "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "1069", "boardgameaccessory": {"205135": "Lagoon: Land of Druids - Druid Faction: Bear"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "152054": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1940596.png", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"72332": {"name": "Aaron Grimshaw"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"72332": "Aaron Grimshaw"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1940596_t.png", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "A casual to intermediate resource-management (and engine-building) game.<br/><br/>Players farm hemp and grain, while taking actions to construct buildings and exchange goods for advancement and to prepare for the end game.

You know the one: instead of playing brave heroes out to save the day from dastardly villains, the party takes on the role of the evildoer, and, between trying to demonstrate how much more nefarious they are than each other, work together to perform some truly heinous acts of evil. It&rsquo;s a chance for the party to let their hair down, take the kid gloves off, and really have some deliciously immoral fun. And now that there are popular adventure modules written for this very purpose, it&rsquo;s easier than ever for GMs to accommodate this sort of fun.<br/><br/>But what about the players? While there&rsquo;s certainly room for moral ambiguity in just about every one of the standard Pathfinder classes, the rules are still clearly written with heroes, not villains, in mind. Creative players can certainly find ways to put existing abilities to use for evil, but what if there were entire archetypes and groups of class features written specifically for those of malign intent? Imagine what sorts of horrors players could get up to then!<br/><br/>This book contains several new archetypes and alternate class features for five different classes: the alchemist, barbarian, rogue, summoner and witch, all of which is designed to make it fun and easy to build truly insidious and reprehensible villains. From the mad science of the body artist&mdash;who can chop up still-living victims and harvest their body parts to form powerful grafts&mdash;to the dark rituals of the altar-bound witch, who specializes in human sacrifice in order to gain incredible magic power, the archetypes, discoveries, rage powers, rogue talents, and hexes included in this book allow players to unleash truly wicked characters on their game world.<br/><br/>Of course, you don&rsquo;t need to be running an evil campaign to get use out of this book. The content is also great for building NPC villains to throw against players of every sort, and the unique mechanical abilities that are provided will help ensure that combat is memorable, and that the villain really gets under the party&rsquo;s skin&mdash;sometimes literally. So don&rsquo;t wait: begin your reign of terror today!<br/><br/>Warning: Please be aware that this book addresses some topics that may make some readers uncomfortable. Because the book is tailored to villainous and evil characters, there is discussion of a variety of villainous and evil things, including (but not necessarily limited to): dismemberment, serial murder, human sacrifice, kidnapping, enslavement, and torture.

I&rsquo;ll tell you. It&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s something about them that triggers primitive instincts within us. They are at once symbols of wisdom, and sources of fear. We think they&rsquo;re cool, but we don&rsquo;t ever quite trust them. They&rsquo;re powerful, sensual, and deadly.<br/><br/>We&rsquo;re back to my fascination with sword-and-sorcery again, and primitive cultures blended with sophisticated magic. I like the mix of crude, tribal serpentfolk coexisting with advanced, learned versions of the same species. I trace it back to my fascination with the Sleestak and the Altrusians in the original Land of the Lost television series. Then again, a lot of my campaign setting of Desteon was influenced by Land of the Lost.<br/><br/>There&rsquo;s also something Cthulhoid about them as well, and I&rsquo;m certainly not the first to point this out or utilize them in this way. I see the advanced serpentfolk as almost science fictional, from the future, another dimension, a faraway star, or some combination of the three. In my mind their magic is only magic of the Arthur C. Clarke variety &mdash; technology, sufficiently advanced, seen as a supernatural force only by lesser minds. They&rsquo;re scary because they may well have a firmer grasp on the true nature of the universe than we do, and they know how to exploit that knowledge. It also means their motives are often unknown, and unknowable, because their minds are working on a completely different level than other humanoids.<br/><br/>In Serpentfolk Hide, I went for a blend of the advanced and the degenerate, and I played around with the mystery of which came first. Were the primitive serpentfolk uplifted, or were the civilized serpentfolk somehow struck down? Was there a single, cataclysmic event, or did it take place over time? Why do they both coexist &mdash; or is time travel somehow involved?

In cities, in country farmhouses, on sailing ships, in the desert, in the tropics, in the frozen wastes. Rats, like humans, can be sweet, or they an be filthy purveyors of disease, and sometimes they can be both. That versatility why I&rsquo;m personally fond of ratfolk as a fantasy race.<br/><br/>In my own Desteon campaign setting, ratfolk occupy the place halflings do in other peoples&rsquo; fantasy worlds. They&rsquo;re underfoot, they&rsquo;re overlooked, they&rsquo;re not taken seriously, and they aren&rsquo;t particularly treated with respect by other race. Add in the fact that rats are considered vermin, and you&rsquo;ve got a race that can be scapegoats to hiss at one minute and underdogs to cheer for the next. This offers up opportunities to tell heartwarming stories of unexpected heroism, as well as creating credible reasons for stories of bitterness and revenge. Ratfolk make great heroes, and fantastic villains.<br/><br/>My love of ratfolk probably stems from a childhood love of anthropomorphic animals. Muppets, Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIHM, even things as odd as the trickster character Ignatz from the class Krazy Kat comic strip. Temper that with being at an impressionable age and living in the city when the films Willard and Ben came out in the 1970s, and there seem to be plenty of rat tropes to work with.

My own campaign world of Desteon is peppered with &ldquo;lost&rdquo; places where dinosaurs, and lizardfolk, still rule. While they&rsquo;re less sophisticated or &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; than warm-blooded humanoids, lizardfolk are a far older race. Rather than making them corrupt and degenerate, I like to play with the idea that they&rsquo;re actually more pure, because they&rsquo;re part of nature. To me, they&rsquo;re guardians of the wetlands, marshes, and swamps, the places that become polluted and destroyed so quickly when humans and their mammalian cousins come stomping through. Even the evil lizardfolk I&rsquo;ve presented here demonstrate that nature is something to be respected, and even feared.<br/><br/>For story purposes, I often build plots that go completely around lizardfolk,, rather than dealing with them directly. They&rsquo;re indigenous tribes in the Amazon, or endangered species. Elves and druids argue on their behalf, trying to protect them from the incursions of the &ldquo;modern&rdquo; world, while in truth the lizardfolk would kill and eat those self-appointed allies as quickly as they&rsquo;d put down anyone else who trespassed in their territory. Those that don&rsquo;t really care about the lizardfolk, and simply want their land and its resources for their own, find that there&rsquo;s no need for hippie elves and druids to fight their battles for them, because the lizardfolk are ferocious and can take care of themselves.<br/><br/>Also, you need to get past all the giant crocodiles, mosquitoes the size of condors, man-eating plants, and yes, carnivorous dinosaurs before you even get to see the lizardfolk in their native habitat.

There are dozens of powers for the Phasing and Teleport Suites here. Awesome Powers Vol. 3 also introduces the concept of &quot;Facets&quot; which are foci within a Suite.  The Teleportation Suite is contains a Teleport, Gateway, and Spatial powers Facet, each which allow their users to manipulate space in different ways.<br/><br/>You'll also find all new Limitations and Enhancements (like Tactical Shunt and Fluke), entirely new Advantages and Disadvantages (like Pocket Dimension and Cosmic Conscript), how to create your own Powers, and Random Character Creation!<br/><br/>Each of the powers presented here explains how to replicate the power described as closely as possible using the existing BASH! Ultimate Edition rules.  In this third volume of Awesome Powers, we present to your two themes, or Power Suites, each based on a different spatial trope. The Phasing Power Suite allows you to move through objects while occupying the same space, while the Teleportation Suite allows you to move through space instantaneously, or possibly bend and warp space.<br/><br/>"}, "152084": {"rpgitemversion": {"227640": "PDF pocketmod version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Savage Flower Kingdom", "rpgproducer": {"11031": "Robertson Sondoh, Jr."}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1868792.jpg", "usersrated": "4", "average": "8.5", "rpggenre": {"940": "Action / Adventure"}, "rpg": {"24172": "Savage Flower Kingdom"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1868792_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Welcome to the world of Savage Flower Kingdom &ndash; where everything will try killing you for fun or dessert.

This pentomino will be his &lsquo;harvester&rsquo;, and the only piece he will use during the game.<br/><br/>The player that chose a shape in first place draws two coins in any empty cells of the grid.<br/><br/>Then, starting with the second player, players take turns doing the following:<br/><br/>1. Draw your harvester on the board, so it doesn&rsquo;t overlap other previously drawn pentominos and no parts of it land outside the board. You can (and should) draw it so it overlaps some coins. Notice that you can draw it rotated or symmetrized, as long as it fits with the grid.<br/>2. Score as many coins as the pentomino has covered<br/>3. Draw another 2 coins in any two empty spaces (not occupied by coins or pentominoes).<br/>4. Pass your turn to the next player.<br/><br/>If you&rsquo;re not capable of legally drawing a pentomino (no room for it) you must pass your turn. If all players pass in succesion the game ends. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>As a variant, before the game starts players can agree on the number of coins drawn each turn.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"227654": "Paper and Pencil edition"}, "name": "The Bitcoin Harvest", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": {"2055": "Paper-and-Pencil"}, "age": "7", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "average": "7.5"}, "152097": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1889042.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"32456": "Neuroshima Hex!

Roosevelt created the Talent Operations Command in 1942 to bring the superhuman powers of Talents into World War II. Talent Operations Command decides which service branch will receive each Talent recruit, a process that can take months thanks to lobbying by the branches, all of them desperate for Talents. Once a Talent is assigned, the service branch  decides how to best use the new recruit.<br/><br/>The Army assigns some of its Talents to &ldquo;regular army&rdquo; positions, tasking them with transporting soldiers and equipment or other support roles. The rest are put into a combat unit called the Talent Operation Group.<br/><br/>The Talent Operations Group consists of hundreds of nine-man squads, trained at the grueling Commando Basic Training Center at Achnacarry Castle, Scotland to conduct hit-and-run strikes and behind-the-lines operations. Their mission is to operate ahead of the main Army force to locate and destroy enemy Talents before they engage the regular troops. Failing that, they are to notify command of enemy Talents&rsquo; presence. Of course, while behind enemy lines, the squads wreak whatever havoc possible.<br/><br/>Most TOG commando teams are assigned to individual U.S. infantry divisions (a division is a unit ranging from 14,253 to 15,500 men). Like normal units, their orders are issued from the command staff of that particular division (or higher headquarters, depending on circumstances). Sometimes, special TOG units are detached for &ldquo;shock troop&rdquo; service and other odd duties, but most just operate as frontline commando scout units. They pave the way for armor and infantry through unknown enemy territory.<br/><br/>Talent Operation Group team 141 &mdash; TOG 141 &mdash; graduated from Achnacarry on May 22, 1944. Led by First Lieutenant Alan Miller and First Sergeant Harvey Braden, they were mobilized and moved to Falmouth, England, just days after their training was complete. All nine are described in detail here.<br/><br/>TOG 141 is composed of eight enlisted men and one officer. The chain of command in a nine-man group is a short one. The lieutenant is in direct command of the sergeant who is in charge of the men, with responsibilities passed down the line. Interaction between the members of TOG 141 is very informal, and the men are encouraged to voice any concern they might have over a mission, idea or objective-but these concerns are always taken up privately. In front of outsiders, the group falls back into military protocol.<br/><br/>Use the men of &ldquo;Miller&rsquo;s Hellions&rdquo; as instantly playable characters. Or you can insert other player characters into the lineup as needed, keeping the characters here as &ldquo;replacements&rdquo; in case something untoward happens.<br/><br/>In fact, it is strongly recommended that you use the Troop Play rules presented in Part Eight: The Campaign to keep in the game a player whose character is killed in combat. If a character &ldquo;buys the farm,&rdquo; hand the player another character from &ldquo;Miller&rsquo;s Hellions&rdquo; to play until a new character can be created for the next session.<br/><br/>Click here to download ready-to-play character sheets for the men of TOG 141.<br/><br/>"}, "152123": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1904106.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"125058": "Dogfight: Free Trial Version"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"37744": {"name": "Brent Evanger"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"11872": "Kurt Miller"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"12556": {"name": "Interaction Point Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1904106_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"2650": {"name": "Aviation / Flight"}}, "description": "Take to the Skies!<br/><br/>Fly a patrol over the trenches and tangle with enemy planes in this set collection card game!<br/><br/>Climb and dive as you jockey for position, attempting to line up the perfect shot.

They seem redundant to goblins, creepy little things that are easy to kill and aren&rsquo;t much of a challenge. Kobolds are dismissed as kind of pointless, and the fact that they&rsquo;re overlook and ignored is precisely why I felt the need to use them in my campaign, give them some dignity and respect, and if not make them cool at least redeem them.<br/><br/>In my campaign world of Desteon, kobolds serve dragons. Literally, in an Upstairs/Downstairs context. The color of the kobold matches the color of the dragon they serve, and the wear uniforms to further identify their station. Have you ever wondered how dragons that have grown so large they can barely move, and sometimes have grown so large they can&rsquo;t fit through the entrance to their treasure horde, eat? Kobolds. They do the cooking and the cleaning, the accounting of the gold, the jewels, and the candlesticks, they light and replace the torches, and keep the piles of loot dusted off and sparkling. If you&rsquo;re the guest of a dragon &mdash; and honestly, I imagine a cavern under a mountain as a sort of mansion &mdash; it&rsquo;s the kobolds that turn down the covers and leave a mint on your pillow.<br/><br/>Much like a Victorian servant, the kobolds are grateful for the job. They get a salary. When they go into town to do the marketing, they&rsquo;re treated with respect because their coin is good and the world for The Dragon. No one is going to mess with them. It&rsquo;s very Dickensian, but that cuts both ways. Kobolds who are not in service are generally destitute and starving, at the bottom of both the social and natural food chain, preyed upon but just about every other creature in the world. If humanoid races were ranked in a caste system, the kobolds would be untouchables, the lowest of the low.<br/><br/>Kobold Hide doesn&rsquo;t try to recast these small reptilian humanoids as more worthy opponents. I&rsquo;ve succumbed to the influence of Charles Dickens and Victor Hugo and tried instead to make them into worthy allies, faithful friends, and objects of sympathy. But if you kick them, they will bite back.

Unfortunately, a mysterious mental infection known as the Fuss has begun to twist and corrupt the visions of every Anchor.<br/><br/>As a player, you take on the role of a visitor, one of the few professionals trained to mind-link with Anchors. During the game, you will traverse a variety of imaginary environments and settings. Your goal: discover the origin of the Fuss and eliminate it, before it consumes the world's finest creative minds -- and perhaps the mental fabric of humanity itself.<br/><br/>"}, "152179": {"boardgamedesigner": {"50803": {"name": "Donald Booth"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Gettysburg Campaign", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1866832_t.jpg", "average": "6.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1866832.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"227787": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1048": {"name": "American Civil War"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Operational level wargame for battle of Gettysburg in American Civil War.

Your spies are lunatics, idiots, and grown-up children. Turns out a big part of growing up is working a nine-to-five job. Your characters are too busy wrecking expensive resorts and capitols to build character.<br/><br/>This game is about getting drunk on the genre.

Zyr-Khan the Conqueror, a crystalline spider from the world on the &ldquo;other side&rdquo; leapt onto Dr. Diamond and instantly possessed him.<br/><br/>Since then the doctor&rsquo;s reputation has changed. Dr. Diamond continues to plot ways to steal dimensional technology, but now there is a dark edge to the formerly soft spoken Doctor&rsquo;s plots. In the last two heists two bystanders have been gravely wounded. Most troubling of all, the heists have been successful. Few suspect Zyr-Khan&rsquo;s true plan is to create a dimensional bomb to send itself home, dragging the city with him in the process.<br/><br/>Events come to a head when the possessed Dr. Diamond breaks into the best equipped physics lab in the city, taking hostages in the process.<br/><br/>"}, "152207": {"rpgitemversion": {"227822": "PDF version"}, "rpgseries": {"24033": "Undead Evolution Series"}, "name": "Wights (Legend)", "rpgproducer": {"72016": "Anthony Uyl"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1867945.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"12019": "Legend"}, "poll": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1867945_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Explore the world of wights in this new supplement.<br/><br/>Discover the horror of the wight along with three of its variations from the harbinger wight, the wild wight and the tomb wight.<br/><br/>Also included are 10 new heroic abilities, 15 new spells (5 common, 5 divine and 5 sorcery) and 5 new special magic items that will bring the horror of the wights to your games.<br/><br/>Also included are stats for the wight god, the Wight Lord, if you are brave enough to challenge a god.<br/><br/>"}, "152212": {"rpg": {"4559": "Mini Six"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "The Mighty Six", "rpgproducer": {"68067": "Paul Hosek"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1867943.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"227830": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"171": "Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1867943_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/><br/>GO ON, BE A HERO...<br/><br/>You know you want to.<br/><br/>How often do you get a chance to race a supersonic jet, take a rocket propelled grenade smack on the chin and crack a smile, or arrive just in the nick of time to save the entire universe?

A city full of priestesses that worship alien beings of immense power, creatures bending reality to their whim, drawing upon primal fears to shape their forms.<br/><br/>The Dark Mother&rsquo;s plots and plans ensnare the whole city in a layer of subtle and not-so subtle-machinations. There in the shadows of the city she watches from her lair, eyes never leaving the most promising of her servants.<br/><br/>Noble houses constantly vie for power; the most powerful can be lost in seconds should they fail in their schemes, so they all try to curry favour in the Dark Mother&rsquo;s court and protect their positions, all the while making sure daggers are firmly placed in the backs of their enemies and the throats of their allies.<br/><br/>The dark elves here need to be careful, for they have enemies above and below, and have to content with their own callous natures. Unknown to them, they have enemies within the city&rsquo;s own shadows &ndash; the ovarisites, a strange race of highly intelligent creatures that plot and plan their demise.<br/><br/>They have concocted bizarre birth ceremonies to ensure the dark elves need them and allow nigh on unrestricted access to the young. Not even the Dark Mother or other gods of the dark elves are aware of the true danger these cunning beings pose.<br/><br/>There are other factions in the streets and alleys of Sheoloth, other branches of dark elf society that seek to seize control one way or another, from the Church of the Killer, the masculine god who attempts to wrest power away from the Dark Mother, to the Incabulos &ndash; dangerous heretics misguided in their belief that the power of the priestesses can be stolen, rather than offered as a gracious gift by the Dark Mother.<br/><br/>The residents of the city must also contend with squabbling merchants, wily thieves and deadly assassins. The shadows cast by these groups interweave with common folk and nobility alike, and not a day goes by when some plan fails or succeeds, resulting in loss of life or freedom either way.<br/><br/>This book allows players to create dark elf characters and explore the City of the Dark Mother from top to bottom, immersing them in dark elf culture for the Legend RPG while providing up new advanced skills such as Style and Intimidation. New professions such as Assassins and Warlocks open the door to the dark elves&rsquo; magical and vicious natures, while the dark elven magic of Shadowcraft, the ability to shape shadows into living beings or objects. Fleshcrafting, too, has its own dark secrets<br/><br/>So prepare to explore the city from the Ashen Bulwark to the Lair of the Dark Mother; just keep one hand on your dagger.<br/><br/>Welcome to Sheoloth.<br/><br/>"}, "152218": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Dropchord", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"227843": "Android edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1942120.png", "videogametheme": {"2455": "Abstract"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "videogamegenre": {"2723": "Endless Runner"}, "videogameplatform": {"6063": "Android"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1942120_t.png", "description": "Heart-Pounding Beats at the Tips of Your Fingers<br/><br/>Dropchord is a music-driven, score challenge game with mesmerizing visuals and an original electronic soundtrack!

Each player rolls a number of dice according to the ship&rsquo;s capabilities, hitting on a result of 6. Gunnery and torpedo damage tables give the results: Ships can suffer damage to engines, hull or armament. Air attacks are resolved in similar fashion.

It can deflect a shot coming from a player that you are not targeting this round. If the kill-o-watt rating is less than or equal to the deflector shield rating (remember to multiply the deflector rating by 1,000 before comparing) the shot has no effect. Otherwise the shot goes through and can be absorbed by a primary shield or disintegrate the player.<br/>-Special ability: each weapon has a unique special ability. Some of these can be particularly game-changing and devastating. Any player may negate the special ability of a weapon at the cost of one crystal (thrown into the pot for the current round), once per round, immediately after the effect would have taken place.<br/><br/>A round of Ray Gun Roulette has a number of phases,<br/>-Choose weapons, dealer deals each player 3 cards, they choose one and discard the rest.<br/>-Ante up!, each player places a crystal in the pot.<br/>-Aim, players pick a target, making a &quot;gun&quot; hand pointing at them.

Determine each patron's order by rolling their own set of special dice, one each of a sauce, meat, and pasta die. The players (chefs) then have to match the patron's order by drawing cards from the grocery delivery (deck) or the pantry (three piles of discarded cards, shared by everyone, that haven't been used to fill an order). Once an order has been filled the player shows everyone their match, moves the patron next to them to keep score, places the used cards in the bus bin (discard pile, you can never dig from the trash to complete an order, that's gross!), and finally seats a new patron (if any are left) and rolls a new order for them. Play continues until everyone has been served.<br/><br/>In addition to the six types of pasta, meat, and sauce cards there are also wild cards and secret ingredient cards (a pasta, meat, or sauce that counts as any other type, but you can only use one to fill an order). There are variations for faster games: using less patrons and/or removing the meat cards and dice (light lunch).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"227888": "First edition"}, "age": "12", "name": "Tabula Pasta", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "5", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"5841": "Food / Cooking"}}, "152250": {"boardgamedesigner": {"68040": {"name": "Group SNE"}}, "average": "6", "poll": {}, "name": "Ghost Hunter 13: The Tile Game", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2017114_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"38161": "Kouji"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"24504": {"name": "cosaic"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2017114.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"227895": "Japanese first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Japanese analog game developer Group SNE makes their popular horror themed tabletop RPG &quot;Ghost Hunter&quot; into a fine co-op tile laying board game.<br/><br/>In this newly introduced rendition of the game, as a team, players explore a mysterious mansion to complete several missions ( long forgotten artifacts, monsters hard to beat, mysteries about the mansion, etc etc... ) which bundled scenarios task them.

Still, they exist.<br/><br/>These individuals are known as gadgeteers, imaginative engineers who prefer the hands-on nature of physical experimentation over the constantly staring at books that is arcane experimentation. Wielding custom-built weapons and a myriad of strange and amusing accessories, the primary advantage of the gadgeteer over the wizard is flexibility in creation. Though a wizard may know hundreds of spells, it takes weeks of work to make a fireball behave even slightly differently. A gadgeteer, on the other hand, can simply rewire her gadget tomorrow morning and have something new ready to go!<br/><br/>The end result of over two months of development, The Gadgeteer: Mother of Invention is Interjection Games' largest product by word count to date. Skirting the line between offensive spellcaster and support character, the gadgeteer's primary innovation is the advent of a Structure Point, or SP pool. These SP are used to create custom weapons from whatever stock weapons are lying around, as well as strange and ridiculous accessories that range from duct tape to a spy cigar stocked with everything from a one-exposure camera to a parachute. In short, a character who wants better accessories must make do with inferior weapons, and vice versa.

It know that it&rsquo;s goofy, made on a ridiculously low budget, and has plot holes you could fly a team of reindeer through. I don&rsquo;t care. It&rsquo;s just fun. The idea that Martians would kidnap Santa Claus to help their children, because their own technological advancements have made them distant and cold, is sweet and touching. With a few notable exceptions, they&rsquo;ve used their technological progress to move away from being a mighty warrior race toward being a kinder, more compassionate people.<br/><br/>The movie was meant to be a Cold War allegory, with the Martians standing in for the Soviets but it never quite works on that level. Certain Martians admired Earth culture and saw adapting to it as a way to resolve their own internal problems, sure, and the superiority of good old American whatever (because Santa is clearly American here, in spite of residing at the North Pole) proves true. I find more in common with modern society; the Martian children are glued to Earth television and have no concept of play, and modern kids are firmly planted in from of screen of various sizes and suffer from obesity because they have no concept of &ldquo;outside&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The film offers up an intersection of fantasy and science fiction that in and of itself makes it transportable to a fantasy roleplaying game. Martians can come from another planet or another plane. Their technology is reminiscent of the classic 1st edition adventure module where adventures explore peaked barriers and find robots and ray guns. There is precedent for this sort of silliness. If your campaign world lacks a Santa Claus analog, there are plenty of deities, demigods, and heroes that the Martians might want to kidnap back to their own world to help resolve their problems, whatever that may be.<br/><br/>For more on using Santa Claus Conquers the Martians as roleplaying game fodder, check out the systemless setting from Asparagus Jumpsuit, available where you acquired this holiday freebie.

More recent interpretations have cast them as comic relief, the villains that act goofy and do stupid things while you merrily slay them by the dozen. To find a proper place for them in my own Desteon campaign world, I&rsquo;ve had to turn to folklore. Where orcs are raiders, sending an army to burn and pillage your town, the goblins pick around the edges. They sneak around, and steal food, and finished goods, and babies. They rely on tricks and annoyances to count coup against larger foes. They&rsquo;re scary because they won&rsquo;t ever come straight at you unless cornered, but they will find sneaky, underhanded ways to hurt you even if they&rsquo;re too weak to kill you. Goblins will screw with your head.<br/><br/>My goblins are scavengers. They&rsquo;re not mighty hunters. They aren&rsquo;t particularly brave. They&rsquo;re craven cowards, actually. They live on the fringes of the civilized world, in tapped-out mine tunnels abandoned by dwarves, in the swamps and caverns near villages and settlements, in the sewers underneath large cities. They don&rsquo;t show themselves willingly, they don&rsquo;t interact with other races unless the situation forces them to, and they generally hide from the light of day so they aren&rsquo;t exterminated for acting like the vermin they are.<br/><br/>Goblin Hide is a bit different from other Monster Hide supplements, then, in that I make no attempt to instill this race with any noble qualities, or make them in any way sympathetic, or try to redeem them. Goblins are creepy, and disgusting, and a blight. They are the cockroaches of humanoids.<br/><br/>"}, "152399": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Hobgoblin Hide: Classic Monsters Reskinned", "rpgproducer": {"32066": "Berin Kinsman"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1873345.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"228166": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"24150": "Hide: Classic Monsters Reskinned"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1873345_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Hobgoblins are another of those races that I struggled to find a role for in my own campaign world of Desteon. Aren&rsquo;t larger goblins just&hellip; orcs? But orcs in the current Pathfinder taxonomy aren&rsquo;t goblins, they don&rsquo;t have the goblin subtype, they&rsquo;re a separate and distinct race. So hobgoblins are more akin to Tolkien orcs, but Pathfinder orcs are more like the post-Tolkien orcs used by everyone else in need of a savage beastman race. Which still leaves me with the question: Why are there two humanoid races that fill the same niche?<br/><br/>My answer is that hobgoblins are not native to my world. They are from another plane, where orcs are a goblinoid subtype. They invaded Desteon via the fey realms. That&rsquo;s why there are so few of them, comparative to the number of &ldquo;orc&rdquo; orcs. My hobgoblins call themselves orcs, they hate being called hobgoblins, and they truly, deeply, passionately hate the creatures that have claimed their race-name. In my world, they may hate those they call &ldquo;false orcs&rdquo; more than they hate their hereditary enemies, the elves.<br/><br/>They difference in alignment works to support this alternate-reality difference as well. Orcs are chaotic evil, and just raid and pillage and wreak havoc at random. Hobgoblins are lawful evil, far more organized, prone to using siege engines and feats of engineering to carry out their detailed and plans and schemes. Their relatively small numbers also support these tactics. They can&rsquo;t throw wave after wave of bodies at a fight like the orcs. They can&rsquo;t afford those types of losses, or they&rsquo;ll be wiped out as a race. They need to rely on secure strongholds, surgical strikes, and alliances with other races including their smaller cousins, the goblins.<br/><br/>Hobgoblin Hide, then, sets out to give this race a reason to exist, and to make them distinct from other races that seem to fill the same niche in a campaign world.<br/><br/>"}, "152400": {"rpgitemversion": {"228167": "PDF version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Assault from the Sky", "rpgproducer": {"17349": "Scott Corum"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1873347.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpg": {"21907": "Victory System"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1873347_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/><br/>SHARPNESS FROM THE SKY!<br/><br/>When the dread sky-ship Caligari drops its shadow on a town, death is certain to follow.

Each player strives to become the most powerful ruling force in the kingdom by gaining control of Fief and Bishopric territories. In turn, they acquire Royal and Ecclesiastical (church) titles which give their families influence to elect the next Pope and King. Players strengthen their positions by negotiating marriage alliances between their families, setting the stage for love, treachery and deception!<br/><br/>Fief is a classic French-language game and is being re-introduced by Academy Games in English with updated rules, new units, a new and larger consolidated map, and more. This edition also includes additional components, which enhances game play.<br/> The game board represents a portion of the Kingdom of France in the Middle Ages. Villages have square outlines that are connected by roads that allow Lord and Troop movement. The villages are grouped into eight colored background areas that represent individual Fiefs, which are domains given to Lords to preside over. Fiefs have different colored backgrounds and Bishoprics have heavy bordered outlines that include several different Fiefs. Each village also belongs to one of five church Bishoprics; each Bishopric is outlined with a heavy border line and is numbered between 1-5 along the edge of the board inside a Bishop's Mitre.<br/><br/>Each player controls up to four family members, comprised of male and female nobles. These family members will rise in power by gaining Royal and Ecclesiastic Titles.<br/><br/>In Fief: France 1429, a player may attempt to gain control of all the villages in a Fief to gain the Royal Title of Baron, Earl or Duke. For each Fief a player controls, he gains 1 VP. These Titled Lords may now take part in the election for the next King. They may even be a candidate to become King, thus bringing 1 VP and more power to the family! Other members of your family may follow the calling of the Church to gain the Ecclesiastical Titles of Bishop and then Cardinal. These titles allow you to Tithe Bishoprics, taking the Church's (i.e. &quot;your&quot;) fair share of income from other Fief Lords! The highest goal your clerical family member can attain is to be elected Pope, bringing 1 VP and special privileges to your family!<br/> You win the game as soon as you have 3 VPs. This is easier said than done and you may need to form alliances with other players through diplomacy and marriage to obtain your goal. When one of your family members marries a noble of another family, the two of you become allied. You now win the game together with 4 VPs and cannot win alone, unless your marriage is annulled by the Pope or your spouse is &quot;mysteriously&quot; murdered or dies of some other foul means!<br/><br/>In addition to being wary of your fellow players, you may draw event cards that can quickly change your destiny. Bounty Event cards are beneficial to the Player and include &quot;Good Harvest&quot;, &quot;Good Weather&quot; and &quot;Added Taxes&quot; cards. But some cards are Disaster Cards that can randomly effect all players in specific Bishoprics. These include &quot;The Plague&quot;, &quot;Heavy Rain&quot;, &quot;Famine&quot;, and &quot;Peasant Uprisings&quot;!<br/><br/>Income can be increased by players imposing church tithes on their opponent's villages or taxing their own Fiefs. Players may purchase new Fief titles, improve their village incomes with mills, and fortify their cities.<br/><br/>Players will also need to protect their land and castles. Men at Arms and Knights can be purchased, as well as Siege Engines. If you feel that other players are not running their Fiefs as well as you can, you may try to invade their territories! But you must risk one of your family members to lead the troops into possible battle, where they might be killed or taken prisoner. If two opposing armies are in the same village square, a Battle may be initiated. The players assess the size and strength of their armies, which determine the number of Battle Dice each may roll. Each &quot;f&quot; rolled is a hit. Men at Arms are defeated with one hit, while Knights require three hits to be removed from the battle.<br/><br/>The Kickstarter Edition of Fief: France 1429 included the Fief: France 1429 Expansions Pack and offered 3-D buildings and metal coins as 'add ons.'
