The five dice have identical sides, but different colors - the die color matters in some occasions (eg. a player can't claim purple civilization square with a green die). Then, according to the roll, the player claims some squares on the central board (civilizations, monuments, Niles etc.) or moves the Ra figure, which determines the remaining time in Epoch. One die side is a joker and can be used as any other side, as long as one of the other dice actually shows the mentioned other side.<br/>Players need to consider how to utilize their roll for the best personal gain. Scoring takes place in three Epochs (with monuments only scored after the third) and is nearly identical as in the original Ra, but this time the score is kept on a score track on the edge of the board, instead of tokens.<br/><br/>From the box: Remember Ra! Now Reiner has added dice to the game and in such a great way. Players still try to score by collecting Pharaohs, niles and floods, monuments and civilizations, but this time they roll dice and choose which to keep and which to re-roll. True to the original game, players must watch out for disasters and each of the three rounds ends when &quot;Ra&quot; shows up a set number of times, so players need to watch Ra and decide when the round may end and when they have more time.

The cards are used to determine movement, combat, and actions such as Axemen, Knights Charge, Chivalry Charge, and Strategic Movement, among others. Players may play each card for only one of the possible three purposes.<br/><br/>CHAINMAIL is thus a game of card play and management, which unfolds on the historical battle map - it uses squares, rather than hexes &ndash; with the use of some beautiful, super-size counters. This is a game of position, feint, and sudden attack with what you hope are better odds (since you don&rsquo;t know what cards your opponent will play, if any, and you never know what his final strength will be). No dice are used. And there are no CRT&rsquo;s. Skill determines the outcome.<br/><br/>The game thus becomes a tense battle. When do you play your cards? How many do you play?

Sure you may have faced the Boogens countless times, but thanks to an Event card, some dark power may have them swinging for double damage or you may find yourself in close quarters with a gimped hand. Or perhaps your next run in with Fear will lead to a friendly side wager about who can swing hardest in a given turn - with added Prestige on the line.<br/><br/>To balance the harsher environment, you will be able to earn powerful Relics. Unlike the Items in the base game, many of these items have game-long abilities to give you an edge over your companions. For example, Vampiric Bracers grants the ability to gain life for powerful attacks, while Talisman of Renown gains an additional Prestige Point every time you gain Prestige. But items of this magnitude aren't just lying around, they must be earned. Perhaps it will require a sacrifice of life to claim one or maybe playing the last action card before the creature dies is the key. It sets up an interesting situation in that you may find yourself deciding between taking action to score a kill - or a Relic.<br/><br/>And speaking of the Relics - many of them are real items created by real artisans. Yep, you can own some of them by contacting the creators in our gallery. And of course, the gallery is full to brimming with more great art from artists around the world and we encourage you to visit their personal galleries to see more of their great works.<br/><br/>All in all, this is an expansion that is not to be missed!<br/><br/><br/>Relics and Ruin will also feature some of the winners from the Create Your Own Enounter Contest including:<br/><br/>    6 MERCURY by Claus Jensen<br/>    3 VENOM SLINGER by Greg Dapkus<br/>    2 WEREBOAR by Fred Barnard<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>And the GRAND PRIZE Winner:<br/>GLUTTONY by Miles Armstrong<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"90350": "English First Edition"}, "average": "7.50292", "name": "Cutthroat Caverns: Relics & Ruin", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "428", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "expands": {"28259": {"name": "Cutthroat Caverns"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"9640": "Cutthroat Caverns"}}, "35523": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic320210.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"7218": {"name": "Matthew Meadows"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2008", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5546": {"name": "MM Board Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic320210_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "In the dead of night he wanders the streets of Hope County, searching for helpless prey.

These can be played at any stage of the game during a players own turn.<br/><br/>Threats can be played against the families laid down by other players and will either destroy a whole family or only take one or more chicks depending on the type of threat. Threats include cats and dogs, rats, stoats and weasels, long line fishing, plastic waste, developers, infertility and virus. Protection measures are laid down on families on the table and they protect against some of the threats. Conservation actions allow a variety of different actions such as exchanging cards with other players, picking up an additional cards and neutralizing threats.<br/><br/>Each round finishes when one player goes out by playing all the cards in their hand onto the table. Points are scored for going out, for each bird in the families on the table and for having protection measures in place on those families.

The goal of the animals is to kill Farmer Brown, while the goal of Farmer Brown is to kill the animals.  The game was a wargame that included some role-playing elements, namely the creation of Farmer Brown allows for differential strengths and weaknesses.  For example, the player can choose to have a fast but weak farmer or a slow but powerful one.  The decision on what characteristics Farmer Brown has will have a major impact on game play and players can alter these characteristics to re-balance the game when played between opponents of differential ability.

The game is named after its inventor, the former world chess champion, Jos&eacute; Ra&uacute;l Capablanca.  Capablanca thought that chess would be played out in a few decades, that games between chess grandmasters would always end in a draw. This danger of &quot;draw death&quot; was a main motivation for him to create a more complex and rich version of chess.<br/><br/>Besides the usual set of chess pieces, each player has additionally two new pieces with corresponding pawns:<br/>Chancellor: a chancellor combines the moves of a Rook or a Knight; Archbishop: an archbishop combines moves of a Bishop and a Knight.<br/><br/>The new pieces have properties that enrich the game. For example, the archbishop can checkmate a bare king by itself (king in a corner, archbishop placed diagonally with one square in between).

For, introducing players to the devastatingly cruel new monsters, thought provoking additions to the Event deck and even more hugely powerful Relics, are two action-packed, full-on Adventure Modules.<br/><br/>Just living and having the most Prestige may no longer be enough to secure a win. And living is no easy matter. Ragnarok the End Bringer is aptly named. Greed allows any Attack card to be played as a Critical Miss. The Lich will turn fallen friends into fallen fiends. All that and you need to effect a rescue too.<br/><br/>Okay, that's what it says on the box... what's it really like?<br/><br/>Tombs and Tomes is our third expansion to Cutthroat Caverns and it takes the exciting new mechanics first introduced in Relics and Ruin and adds even more sinister fun to the mix of Events and Relic Cards. Try battling a familiar friend like the Cursed Goblin while the walls close in and your hand size shrinks every turn or have every Relic in the room suddenly come to life and attack you when the Encounter is over, where the first one to beat a Relic into submission may claim it.<br/><br/>And they are worth claiming. Bloodstone allows you to inflict 5 damage to any player at the end of an Encounter - and should any player die, you gain 3 Prestige. Or Ring of Storing which allows you to store an Action card immediately after playing it for a future second use. Perhaps Evil Eye is more your style, punishing those who would do you harm.<br/><br/>But what makes this set truly unique is a whole new way to play the game. Included within are two Adventure Modules, The Lady of Magtherium and Mad God's Maze. Yes, these are self guided (no gamemaster needed, you can all play) full blown adventure stories. Yes, they each have a unique plot and multiple possible endings. It is a 'choose your own path' styled module with decisions to make and consequences for your actions.<br/><br/>There is far more to it than in the base game of completing 9 Encounters. You must solve puzzles and avoid traps between the Encounters, decide marching order or who among you will take an action (and it may matter who), and determine through the course of your actions how the story will unfold. And in classic style, a big boss battle awaits you.<br/><br/>Moreover, there may be new winning or losing conditions. For example, in The Lady of Magtherium, you discover a noblewoman (an NPC) whom you must rescue to win. She won't fight, but can be hurt - and if she dies, you all lose.<br/><br/>Yes, these are one-shots and you will finish a module in a single sitting, so the modules themselves do not add to replay value. BUT they add so much depth and richness to the Encounters that when you sprinkle them into the regular game, they will be far more interesting. Of course, the real fun is that they represent what can be done with the game yourself. Creating and playing your own unique dungeon module is a great new way for fans to enjoy the game and we've got guidelines to get you started right here.<br/><br/>On another note, this set features a number of other winners in our Create an Encounter Contest. There are some major 'big bads' here folks.

The Falkland/Malvinas War had begun in earnest.<br/><br/>Over the next 45 days, the armed forces of the United Kingdom and Argentina locked in a deadly struggle, as both attempted to assert their right to govern a small, inhospitable South Atlantic island unknown to most of the world and to many of those fighting over her.<br/><br/>    In this solitaire military simulation boardgame, you have the opportunity to recreate those fateful summer days, commanding the British Task Force as it attempts to defend itself from concerted attacks by Argentine air and naval forces, and mount a successful amphibious landing on the disputed islands.  You will have to manage and deploy the Royal Navy&rsquo;s limited Sea Harrier assets, coordinate the defence of the fleet with a wide range of vessels and weapons systems, and plan a landing strategy that enables you to consolidate a bridgehead before Argentine forces can respond.  Modeled closely on historical events, you will confront issues including variable rules of engagement, surveillance and intelligence gathering, submarine warfare, Argentine carrier and surface fleet operations, the Exocet missile threat, third-party operational support and interference, fleet logistics, supply interdiction, and uncooperative weather.  At the same time you will have to walk the tightrope of public opinion, deal with &ldquo;oversight&rdquo; from the politicians back in London, and overcome unforeseen events ranging from the sabotage of supply lines up to orders to take the fight to the mainland.<br/> Will the Falklands remain in British hands, or will the Malvinas return to Argentina?

You can make a striker, grappler or a balance of both, then choose your special styles and abilities and you're ready to go. You play through 3 quick phases. Each player rolls a die and adds any bonus they have to determine which of them is the most mobile on the current turn, then the player that wins mobility moves a marker to show the posture and range between the fighters. (Short Range, Long Range, Full Guard, Half Guard etc...) He then plays a card vs his opponent. The card could be a punch, a kick, an elbow, a neck hold, or any number of various special moves. You roll dice and use your fighter's strengths combined with his position to instantly determine the success level of the attack. Your opponent then does the same to you. You each then refill your hand and attempt to recover from any damage you may currently have. You keep repeating the process until the round ends (the draw deck is empty).<br/><br/>The really exciting thing is that the game can end at any moment, just like in a real mixed martial arts match. If you catch your opponent with a devastating strike or lock in a powerful hold, the match ends instantly in a knockout or a tapout. Both players are on the edge of their seats throughout the whole game knowing that it could be all over at any second. You can also wear down your foe until the ref stops the fight because one fighter is unable to intelligently defend himself (He's taken too much damage). Another way to win is that successful attack cards set aside during each round count as points from the &quot;judges&quot; to determine a winner if the fight &quot;Goes the distance.&quot;<br/><br/>You can play the game over and over again because you can design a unique fighter every time you play. There are so many different cards that no two matches are ever the same. Most matches between experienced players are finished within about 10 or 15 minutes, so you get to play multiple matches per game session. Alot of attention was put into writing the instructions. Only one person really needs to read them. The game comes with a Quick Reference Card that you can use to teach somebody how to play quickly. The game is designed to fit into a pocket. You can fit the whole game into a little plastic sandwich bag or one of those little plastic boxes that you buy to hold sports trading cards.<br/><br/>Each match is decided between 2 players, but the game is ideal for multi-player tournaments. Having multiple copies of the game (One for each pair of players) is recommended but not absolutely necessary because of the short playing time and the game's rare quality of being so exciting to watch even if your not in the current match being played.<br/><br/>What you get...<br/>The game is simply a 90 card deck. 2 cards are not used for playing. 8 of the cards create a full color easy-to-use play chart. 1 card contains cutout counters (but you can use anything for counters). 8 of the cards (along with the counters) are used to create your fighter. 8 cards contain the instructions (English only). 2 cards provide a quick reference of the instructions for each player during play. 61 cards make up a playing deck packed with exciting B&amp;W photos of all your favourite MMA techniques. You need 6 regular six-sided dice (not normally included).<br/><br/>"}, "35634": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic552609.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"2": {"name": "Reiner Knizia"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"11883": "Franz Vohwinkel"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"29": {"name": "ABACUSSPIELE"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic552609_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Samurai - the Card Game simulates the board game by placing cities on the board and then allowing each player to play one of their 5 cards from their hands.

Then play one Action Card. At the end of your turn, draw enough cards to fill your hand up to (5).<br/><br/>Infection Cards: are a person, place, or thing that spreads the epidemic. Each Infection Card has two symbols. An Epidemic grows as cards are placed adjacent to the initial Infection card. Cards can only be placed adjacent to another card if the symbol in the corner facing that card matches.<br/><br/>Example: A Rock Star card has the LIPS symbol in both corners. The Big Bear Biker card has LIPS in the lower right corner, so it can be placed on the left-hand side so that the LIPS symbols touch, thereby spreading the infection and growing the epidemic.<br/><br/>Outbreak Cards: are wild cards that allow an additional card to be played. The Outbreak Card DOES NOT count toward the (5) cards needed to complete and Epidemic.<br/><br/>Action Cards: are objects or items that either: (1) stop or slow an Epidemic by blocking or killing an infection. (2) enhance or accelerate an Epidemic by making the infection immune to the effects of a block<br/>or kill card.<br/><br/>Block Cards: block one side of an Epidemic.

Everyone starts with $300 and 5 credentials.  Driving is mostly uneventful except for small financial transactions.  Luck &quot;in the field&quot; is determined by flipping over situation cards when you land on situation space.  Some cards have animals you can try to shoot at, others have bad luck type situations you need to over come by moving or playing a credential card.

Rival Families will provide stiff competition, and all will have to contend with the force of nature that dictates the pattern of Egyptian life -- the River Nile. In flood the Nile can provide increased harvests but may also damage structures, whereas severe drought will cause starvation and suffering.<br/><br/>Pharaoh has issued several decrees. He demands a great harvest, sufficient people to build yet another mighty monument to himself upon his death (most likely a pyramid, although occasionally the Pharaohs preferred big cat-like things), as well as in increase in the worship of (read: sacrifice to) his favorite gods. In return for excelling in these areas of ancient Egyptian life, Pharaoh is willing to make you his heir. Oh, yes, one last thing -- Pharaoh also rewards the Families that develop the most valuable buildings and the most desirable land districts...<br/><br/>Rules can be found on the Piecepack Wiki.<br/><br/>Game System<br/><br/>    Piecepack Game System<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "35941": {"boardgamedesigner": {"810": {"name": "Lloyd Krassner"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Fifth Element", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic328694_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"873": {"name": "Warp Spawn Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic328694.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"181688": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A card game based on the movie of the same name.
