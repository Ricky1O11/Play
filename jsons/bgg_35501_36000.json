Pharaohs, The Nile, Civilizations, and Monuments as well as the occasional catastrophe are all here.<br/><br/>Instead of auctions, the core mechanism of Ra, each player rolls 5 dice and can reroll any of them up to two times. The five dice have identical sides, but different colors - the die color matters in some occasions (eg. a player can't claim purple civilization square with a green die). Then, according to the roll, the player claims some squares on the central board (civilizations, monuments, Niles etc.) or moves the Ra figure, which determines the remaining time in Epoch. One die side is a joker and can be used as any other side, as long as one of the other dice actually shows the mentioned other side.<br/>Players need to consider how to utilize their roll for the best personal gain. Scoring takes place in three Epochs (with monuments only scored after the third) and is nearly identical as in the original Ra, but this time the score is kept on a score track on the edge of the board, instead of tokens.<br/><br/>From the box: Remember Ra! Now Reiner has added dice to the game and in such a great way. Players still try to score by collecting Pharaohs, niles and floods, monuments and civilizations, but this time they roll dice and choose which to keep and which to re-roll. True to the original game, players must watch out for disasters and each of the three rounds ends when &quot;Ra&quot; shows up a set number of times, so players need to watch Ra and decide when the round may end and when they have more time.

No dice are used. And there are no CRT&rsquo;s. Skill determines the outcome.<br/><br/>The game thus becomes a tense battle. When do you play your cards? How many do you play?

And mixed among the Events are ways to earn powerful new Relics that confer game changing abilities upon their owners.<br/><br/>Plus, this set includes 15 of the deadliest creatures yet. Can you resist the lure of a 14-card hand? Will you succumb to the PVP inducing effects of Voodoo? Or will you become a horrific beast yourself in the final moments and turn on your companions?<br/><br/>Okay, that's what it says on the box... what's it really like?<br/><br/>Relics and Ruin is the second expansion to Cutthroat Caverns and what an expansion it is! First, let me highlight the fact that several of the Encounters and the inspiration for the Event Deck came from you, the fans, in our Create an Encounter Contest. Sure, we beat 'em into shape - but these amazingly compelling encounters get right at the heart of what players wanted - because players created them. And as you will see, they are deadlier than ever - with many new and unique ways to challenge players to work with and against each other.<br/><br/>Plus, the Event Deck is an inspired way to keep the game evergreen. Sure you may have faced the Boogens countless times, but thanks to an Event card, some dark power may have them swinging for double damage or you may find yourself in close quarters with a gimped hand. Or perhaps your next run in with Fear will lead to a friendly side wager about who can swing hardest in a given turn - with added Prestige on the line.<br/><br/>To balance the harsher environment, you will be able to earn powerful Relics. Unlike the Items in the base game, many of these items have game-long abilities to give you an edge over your companions. For example, Vampiric Bracers grants the ability to gain life for powerful attacks, while Talisman of Renown gains an additional Prestige Point every time you gain Prestige. But items of this magnitude aren't just lying around, they must be earned. Perhaps it will require a sacrifice of life to claim one or maybe playing the last action card before the creature dies is the key.

These can be played at any stage of the game during a players own turn.<br/><br/>Threats can be played against the families laid down by other players and will either destroy a whole family or only take one or more chicks depending on the type of threat. Threats include cats and dogs, rats, stoats and weasels, long line fishing, plastic waste, developers, infertility and virus. Protection measures are laid down on families on the table and they protect against some of the threats. Conservation actions allow a variety of different actions such as exchanging cards with other players, picking up an additional cards and neutralizing threats.<br/><br/>Each round finishes when one player goes out by playing all the cards in their hand onto the table. Points are scored for going out, for each bird in the families on the table and for having protection measures in place on those families.

The game is named after its inventor, the former world chess champion, Jos&eacute; Ra&uacute;l Capablanca.  Capablanca thought that chess would be played out in a few decades, that games between chess grandmasters would always end in a draw. This danger of &quot;draw death&quot; was a main motivation for him to create a more complex and rich version of chess.<br/><br/>Besides the usual set of chess pieces, each player has additionally two new pieces with corresponding pawns:<br/>Chancellor: a chancellor combines the moves of a Rook or a Knight; Archbishop: an archbishop combines moves of a Bishop and a Knight.<br/><br/>The new pieces have properties that enrich the game. For example, the archbishop can checkmate a bare king by itself (king in a corner, archbishop placed diagonally with one square in between). Capablanca thought that adding these two powerful pieces would reduce the likelihood of a draw and make the game itself more interesting.<br/><br/>You can play Capablanca Chess online on Jocly website:<br/><a target='_blank' href='https://www.jocly.com/' rel='nofollow'>https://www.jocly.com/</a><br/><br/>Other Sister Chess variants are: Seirawan Chess, Musketeer Chess, Carrera Chess, Gothic Chess, Janus Chess ..<br/><a target='_blank' href='http://www.musketeerchess.net/' rel='nofollow'>http://www.musketeerchess.net/</a><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "name": "Capablanca Chess", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement"], "average": "5.8", "usersrated": "10", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Chess Games"]}, "35577": {"boardgamedesigner": ["John Manners"], "poll": [], "name": "Duke of Rutland's Chess", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement"], "yearpublished": "1747", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic324536_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Public Domain)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic324536.jpg", "boardgamefamily": ["Chess Games"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "This game was invented by John, third Duke of Rutland in 1747.<br/><br/>The game is played on a checkered board with 10 rows and 14 columns.

For, introducing players to the devastatingly cruel new monsters, thought provoking additions to the Event deck and even more hugely powerful Relics, are two action-packed, full-on Adventure Modules.<br/><br/>Just living and having the most Prestige may no longer be enough to secure a win. And living is no easy matter. Ragnarok the End Bringer is aptly named. Greed allows any Attack card to be played as a Critical Miss. The Lich will turn fallen friends into fallen fiends. All that and you need to effect a rescue too.<br/><br/>Okay, that's what it says on the box... what's it really like?<br/><br/>Tombs and Tomes is our third expansion to Cutthroat Caverns and it takes the exciting new mechanics first introduced in Relics and Ruin and adds even more sinister fun to the mix of Events and Relic Cards. Try battling a familiar friend like the Cursed Goblin while the walls close in and your hand size shrinks every turn or have every Relic in the room suddenly come to life and attack you when the Encounter is over, where the first one to beat a Relic into submission may claim it.<br/><br/>And they are worth claiming. Bloodstone allows you to inflict 5 damage to any player at the end of an Encounter - and should any player die, you gain 3 Prestige. Or Ring of Storing which allows you to store an Action card immediately after playing it for a future second use. Perhaps Evil Eye is more your style, punishing those who would do you harm.<br/><br/>But what makes this set truly unique is a whole new way to play the game. Included within are two Adventure Modules, The Lady of Magtherium and Mad God's Maze. Yes, these are self guided (no gamemaster needed, you can all play) full blown adventure stories. Yes, they each have a unique plot and multiple possible endings. It is a 'choose your own path' styled module with decisions to make and consequences for your actions.<br/><br/>There is far more to it than in the base game of completing 9 Encounters. You must solve puzzles and avoid traps between the Encounters, decide marching order or who among you will take an action (and it may matter who), and determine through the course of your actions how the story will unfold. And in classic style, a big boss battle awaits you.<br/><br/>Moreover, there may be new winning or losing conditions. For example, in The Lady of Magtherium, you discover a noblewoman (an NPC) whom you must rescue to win. She won't fight, but can be hurt - and if she dies, you all lose.<br/><br/>Yes, these are one-shots and you will finish a module in a single sitting, so the modules themselves do not add to replay value. BUT they add so much depth and richness to the Encounters that when you sprinkle them into the regular game, they will be far more interesting. Of course, the real fun is that they represent what can be done with the game yourself. Creating and playing your own unique dungeon module is a great new way for fans to enjoy the game and we've got guidelines to get you started right here.<br/><br/>On another note, this set features a number of other winners in our Create an Encounter Contest. There are some major 'big bads' here folks. For those who felt that the game was &quot;too easy&quot; and that characters don't seem to die enough - well, all I can say is be careful what you wish for. There are 15 more vicious Encounters (bringing the total to 75!) and we can almost guarantee that unless you make an effort to work together, players are gonna die. A lot.<br/><br/>The stuff in this box is a helluva lot of fun to play and opens up a whole new world of possibilities!

You can make a striker, grappler or a balance of both, then choose your special styles and abilities and you're ready to go. You play through 3 quick phases. Each player rolls a die and adds any bonus they have to determine which of them is the most mobile on the current turn, then the player that wins mobility moves a marker to show the posture and range between the fighters. (Short Range, Long Range, Full Guard, Half Guard etc...) He then plays a card vs his opponent. The card could be a punch, a kick, an elbow, a neck hold, or any number of various special moves. You roll dice and use your fighter's strengths combined with his position to instantly determine the success level of the attack. Your opponent then does the same to you. You each then refill your hand and attempt to recover from any damage you may currently have. You keep repeating the process until the round ends (the draw deck is empty).<br/><br/>The really exciting thing is that the game can end at any moment, just like in a real mixed martial arts match. If you catch your opponent with a devastating strike or lock in a powerful hold, the match ends instantly in a knockout or a tapout. Both players are on the edge of their seats throughout the whole game knowing that it could be all over at any second. You can also wear down your foe until the ref stops the fight because one fighter is unable to intelligently defend himself (He's taken too much damage). Another way to win is that successful attack cards set aside during each round count as points from the &quot;judges&quot; to determine a winner if the fight &quot;Goes the distance.&quot;<br/><br/>You can play the game over and over again because you can design a unique fighter every time you play. There are so many different cards that no two matches are ever the same. Most matches between experienced players are finished within about 10 or 15 minutes, so you get to play multiple matches per game session. Alot of attention was put into writing the instructions. Only one person really needs to read them. The game comes with a Quick Reference Card that you can use to teach somebody how to play quickly. The game is designed to fit into a pocket. You can fit the whole game into a little plastic sandwich bag or one of those little plastic boxes that you buy to hold sports trading cards.<br/><br/>Each match is decided between 2 players, but the game is ideal for multi-player tournaments.

In the case of multiple units having the same die roll, the stands must roll for first activation.<br/><br/>Many of the chartless systems (e.g., morale) rely on the use of special dice for effect.<br/><br/>In each section of the rules there are optional rules and designers notes.<br/><br/>Yahoo Group:  <a target='_blank' href='http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/looksargenocharts/' rel='nofollow'>http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/looksargenocharts/</a><br/><br/>"}, "35704": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic602659.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Bruno Cathala", "Serge Laget"], "statistics": [], "boardgamecompilation": ["Shadows over Camelot: Sir Bedivere, the 8th Knight"], "yearpublished": "2008", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": ["Cyrille Daujean", "Julien Delval"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Days of Wonder"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic602659_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Deduction", "Expansion for Base-game", "Medieval", "Mythology"], "description": "From DOW blog<br/><br/>Merlin&rsquo;s Company is a new expansion for the popular Shadows over Camelot board game.

Mountain uplifts 1,500 meters per turn until one player reaches 8,000 meters or the ACTIVE UPLIFT SHUTDOWN event card is drawn. Then, its a race to see who can erode their mountain away the fastest.  When a player successfully erodes their mountain, the game ends.<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the most sediment in their delta (after subtracting away any sediment that remains in their mountain)!!!<br/><br/>To the play the game, you need to print out a copy of the rules, the bidding row, the game cards (the card types include event, process, mountain front, and mountain type), and enough game boards for the number of players that will play.  A cool rock and a cup to hold the sediment is also needed.  I recommend printing the game materials (except the rules) in color, on 11&quot; x 17&quot; cardstock.  You will also need to buy a couple boxes of Jujubees (you can eat them while you play), as they are the &quot;sediment&quot; used in the game.

Aside from rolling dice to determine how far to move the game is played primarily with a big composite spinner, which determines the outcome of things like shooting game, luck at the horse track, and playing poker.  Everyone starts with $300 and 5 credentials.  Driving is mostly uneventful except for small financial transactions.  Luck &quot;in the field&quot; is determined by flipping over situation cards when you land on situation space.  Some cards have animals you can try to shoot at, others have bad luck type situations you need to over come by moving or playing a credential card.  Each time a player circumnavigates the lodge (spends one day hunting) they receive a credential and have an opportunity to answer a hunting or safety related question for a cash bonus.<br/><br/>"}, "35831": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Miia Nieminen", "Anna Sairanen"], "poll": [], "name": "Liskosafari", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "7", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Fishes", "Animals: Lizards", "Sports: Sailing"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic324449_t.jpg", "average": "4.42857", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Kirjalito"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic324449.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Dice", "Economic"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A Finnish game where players try to collect a set of lizards for the zoo.
