It presents a conflict between two superpowers of Antiquity from the classical Clausewitzian perspective, according to which a power only reverts to military operations when there is no other way to achieve political dominance.<br/><br/>HANNIBAL was  designed by the world-renowned Mark Simonitch. This 20th Anniversary Edition of the game includes new scenarios and variants. Certain game mechanics have been streamlined, while producing exactly the same game results as the golden classic. HANNIBAL has won numerous awards (including the Golden Geek Best 2-Player Board Game Award and the Golden Geek Best Wargame Award), and is currently ranked 11th in BoardGameGeek.com&rsquo;s Wargame rankings.<br/><br/>The original rules and components were updated by Mark Simonitch and Jaro Andruszkiewicz. The development team at PHALANX has given the original game a careful, meticulous update. It is now easier and faster to play. It has received new artwork. The original game has been further enriched by the addition of two new expansions: Sun of Macedon and Price of Failure. These expansions are not Kickstarter exclusives, so they will be included in all copies of the game. This 20th Anniversary Edition of the game includes new scenarios and variants as well as new graphics, miniatures, new custom dice, extra cards, and a new double-sided mounted board (with the HANNIBAL map on one side and the HAMILCAR map on the other).<br/><br/>HAMILCAR, set during the First Punic War, is a companion game sharing components and using similar mechanics. It introduces a naval system and naval battles. Both players compete for control of the Mediterranean Sea in a conflict that will be described as the first war between an elephant and a whale - the struggle of a land-based empire versus the world&rsquo;s naval power. Rome's goal was to break through the island chain of Sicily, Corsica, and Sardinia - Carthage's defensive line to contain Rome on the Italian peninsula.<br/><br/>In both games players use Strategy Cards for multiple purposes: moving generals, levying new troops, reinforcing existing armies, gaining political control of the provinces involved in the war, and introducing historical events. When two armies meet on the battlefield, a second set of cards, called Battle Cards, are used to determine the winner.

The objective of the game is to develop your Necromancer and take control of the lands. Each player starts out as an aspiring Necromancer who can study spells, craft artifacts and eventually graduate from one of four academies. In time, your Necromancer can attract their own apprentice and assemble an undead army of minions to rule the lands.<br/><br/>Your Necromancer can venture into dungeons where they will encounter wonders and dangerous creatures &ndash; and perhaps meet new companions. In the end, your Necromancer might be able to return to their academy and become Headmaster &ndash; or even seize the foulest of thrones as the Necromancer King.<br/><br/>Each player moves his or her miniature Necromancer around the game board to gather resources, spells and artifacts, enter dungeons, battle cities and fight rival Necromancers.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, Necromancers can increase their combat and movement abilities as they amass their armies.

Superbeings from all corners of the universe have taken their sides, it's the rise of the Superbeings Battle Universe!<br/><br/>Superbeings is an all-new relaunch of the anime-styled Humaliens Trading Card Game released in 2003 by AEG with a completely new design and storyline by creator Rick Medina.<br/><br/>Impressive 4.75&quot; x 6.75&quot; Oversized Cards<br/>If you have collected just 1 oversized card from a popular card game out there and ever wondered about playing an entire set of them, now you can. Superbeings Jumbo Card Game will be the first card game entirely designed with awesome oversized cards for players ages 10 and up.<br/><br/>Why Play The Superbeings Jumbo Card Game?<br/>Simply put... Superbeings is an impressive strategic Jumbo Card Game set in an immersive storyline, centered on a futuristic Superbeings Battle Universe that will absolutely capture your imagination. Every Superbeing has a story that's flavored on every card, along with their Superpower, main Attack and Invincibility Effect to get you into the game.<br/><br/>Also, as a 2-4 player Living Card Game and Deckbuilder, the 120-card Battle Universe Core Set is a completely self-contained game experience, there's no expensive packs to buy, just great value in a full set purchase that has infinite replayability right out of the box.<br/><br/>Furthermore, while we don't like to mention names &quot;cough - Pokemon TCG, cough - Yugioh TCG&quot; the game is targeted at all of you (10+ and adults) who've played these games and would like to experience another cool choice powered by big cards and a unique Superbeings Battle Universe!<br/><br/>So What Else Is Cool About Superbeings?<br/>Superbeings features a 6-Super Team concept of playing with multiple frontline attackers and multiple backline reinforcements with the objective to win by 1 of 3 ways; (1) by knocking out your opponent's entire frontline, or (2) knockout a total of 5 Supers, or (3) knockout 15 rank points worth of Supers.<br/><br/>In addition, the game uses a variety of D6, D12 and D20 dice rolling mechanics for establishing turn actions, attacks and more. So if you like dice rolling, you'll expecially like Superbeings and how it differs from Pokemon and Yugioh's card only mechanics.<br/><br/>Finally, the game plays big! So the traditional 2-player heads-up game is the easiest to start with and is the preferred play style. But when the opportunity for a massive 4-player game is called upon, there's an entirely different feel to the game when 4 players do battle to win it all!<br/><br/>Stunning Full Bleed Card Artwork<br/>All the double-sided Superbeing and front-side Battle cards have been designed with border-to-border full bleed artwork. No traditional card borders will be used on Superbeings except for the back of the Battle cards where the Superbeings logo will be shown. As such, be prepared to hold some awesome cards in your hands, vividly printed and absolutely striking to play.<br/><br/>Superbeings Level Of Difficulty<br/>The Superbeings Jumbo Card Game is a player vs player battling game at its roots and can be best described as a cool alternative to the popular Pokemon and Yugioh trading card games and is targeted at players ages 10 and up. If you&rsquo;ve played either Pokemon or Yugioh you&rsquo;ll find Superbeings has card effects that are similar in difficulty to these games with its own unique big game feel.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "Superbeings Jumbo Card Game", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Deck / Pool Building", "Hand Management"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Living Card Game"]}, "227004": {"poll": [], "name": "MMM: Murder Most Misfortunate", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "7", "videogametheme": ["Detective / Mystery"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Foolish Mortals Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Visual Novel"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Foolish Mortals Games"], "description": "A gruesome murder interrupts an evening party at a secluded mansion and you are the prime suspect!

When they play a totem card, they can start a totem or add to a totem &mdash; but when adding to a totem at least one of the colored marks on the card being added must be placed in the same column as the card being covered, even if this means the card being placed doesn't line up exactly with the card below.

The spells are &quot;Wind blows left/right&quot;, &quot;Zap&quot;, and &quot;Gift&quot;. The caster of the wind spell chooses a height above the first level, then all cards at the level and above are shifted one column left or right, depending on the wind. If parts of a totem have no support, then those cards are discard. Zap removes the top card in a player's totem, and Gift requires each player to pass one card in hand left and the other right.<br/><br/>As soon as a totem consists of at least four cards and the top card is centered with the bottom card (regardless of the positioning of the intervening cards), the player can top the totem with a thunderbird card to win the game.

Takes social combat to the next level.<br/>    The legionary base class is all about a citizen soldier who gains political advantage from his service. Combat, skills, social stuff- it&rsquo;s got it all (in measure).<br/>    Showman is a magical trickster / conman and is just absurdly fun to play with when used right.<br/>    7 new spells and a new magic item.<br/>    20+ new feat (lots of them social).<br/>    Ever want to know how much it was to arrange a marriage or have someone killed (...or both at the same time?)- we got you covered with our services section.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>New Base Classes:<br/><br/>    Noble: D8, medium BAB, and 8 + Int skill points. It kind of plays like a social-heavy rogue if you squinted really hard and just looked at the math. It&rsquo;s got talk down, which is basically super-social combat. They can forgo damage to control enemies a bit and even give some allies temporary HP. They are tied to an organization and it influences how they can use some resources. I&rsquo;m skipping over a lot (because I know I&rsquo;m rambling) but they get &ldquo;social graces&rdquo; every other level, which is basically akin to a fighter getting their combat feats every other level except these are utility/social ones. These characters make devastating utility/option-based social characters (like a... social wizard kind of) or can be a straight battle-noble. Lots of fun (we&rsquo;ve play-tested the hell out of it), very versatile, and a great addition to any table.<br/>    Legionary: One of my designers described it thusly: &ldquo;if the noble is the social wizard, the legionary is the social magus&rdquo;. It draws from the idea of the citizen soldier- the politically motivated warrior who advances as he goes. The terminology is taken from Roman soldiers from the 2nd punic war but it fits with anything if you file the serial numbers off it. They are a straight up martial character: d10, full bab, good will. They kind of play like a flexible fighter (they retrain a small number of &ldquo;tactics&rdquo; each day&rdquo;) with a lot of equipment based abilities (&ldquo;If you are mounted I get a bonus&rdquo;, &ldquo;If you and I have the same weapon, I get a bonus&rdquo;, etc). They also get a small compliment of social abilities (some skill bonuses, something like social graces from the noble, etc).<br/>    Showman: The &ldquo;magical social character&rdquo;. They are more magical conman / mystic trickster than mundane noble or rogue. As a caster they have a lot of mind affecting and illusion stuff. They are kind of circus / theatrical themed and have a cool weapon that you have to &ldquo;roll to disbelieve&rdquo;. I won&rsquo;t go into it a lot but their class features, if used right, are just absurdly fun to trick people with (the person who figures out why &ldquo;Liar Liar&rdquo; is such a clever talent gets a cookie). It&rsquo;s also got a &ldquo;ringleader&rdquo; archetype which is almost a hybrid class with our multiman from gonzo 2 (it gets the clone class feature).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "227104": {"rpgartist": ["Storn Cook", "James Denton", "Cathi Martinez", "Eryck Webb"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgseries": ["Super-Powered by M&M"], "name": "Do Not Approach", "rpgdesigner": ["Robert Grady"], "rpgproducer": ["Robert Grady"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3544082.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Capes, Cowls and Villains Foul", "Mutants & Masterminds (3rd Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Tripod Machine"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3544082_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Tripod Machine presents eleven dastardly super-villains, Super-Powered by M&amp;M!

Players can win the game by winning two rounds or get eliminated from the game by losing two rounds.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds. Each round, the player sets up the base character &mdash; one of eight heroes in the box &mdash; and all the equipment this character has. This one character represents every player being a fully-equipped dungeon delver.<br/><br/>The start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn. If they choose to draw, they can do one of two things: (1) keep it and remove a piece of equipment or (2) place it face down in the dungeon. Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with monsters that the challenger will have to face later. If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot participate in the rest of the round. Once only one person is left after all the other players have passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the equipment currently on the character.<br/><br/>The player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the monsters within. Some equipment allows you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by increasing your HP. If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round; if not, they lose. The players then reshuffle all the cards to make a new monster deck and use the same or a different hero to start the boasting once again.<br/><br/>The game ends when someone has won twice or one player is the last person standing.<br/><br/>Dungeon of Mandom VIII includes the material in the original Dungeon of Mandom as well as seven new heroes, seven new monsters, and forty new pieces of equipment, with those items having previously appeared in Welcome to the Dungeon and Welcome Back to the Dungeon.<br/><br/>"}, "227111": {"videogamebg": ["Race for the Galaxy"], "name": "Race for the Galaxy", "videogamemode": ["Asynchronous Multiplayer", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iOS edition"], "average": "9.28571", "videogametheme": ["Board Game", "Card / Casino Games", "Space"], "usersrated": "7", "videogamedeveloper": ["Temple Gates Games LLC"], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["iPad", "iPhone"], "poll": [], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Temple Gates Games LLC"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Race for the Galaxy is a strategy boardgame where players advance their empire by playing cards to build technological developments or to settle planets.

Each Population Token represents about 50 People. <br/>-  Land Tokens (LT) are used to give access to food and resources. <br/>-  Food Tokens (FT) are used to feed your people.  They are gained by claiming certain cards. <br/>-  Horse Tokens (HT) give advantages to Raids.  <br/>-  Weapons Tokens(WT) give advantages to Raids. <br/>-  Spirit Tokens (ST) have a variety of uses. <br/>-  Trade Tokens (TT) represent things like furs and skins or crafted items that are used to trade with whites for things like weapons and horses. <br/>-  Craft Tokens (CT) represent an accumulation of skilled labour.<br/><br/>Players share a common Spirit Card deck.  Cards are of 2 basic types: Resource Cards and Bonus Cards. <br/>-  Resource cards provide tokens and are then Discarded. <br/>-  Bonus Cards are placed face-up in front of the owner and provide either a continuous benefit or are discarded for a one-time benefit.<br/><br/>At the start of the game each player gets 10 PT, 10 LT and 10 ST.

An activated PT can hunt (claim a face up spirit card) or go on a raid or go trading. <br/>3. Hunt Phase<br/>-  Resolve Spirit Card purchases and conversions as soon as they are claimed.  Some Spirit Cards have a purchase cost in tokens. This must be paid immediately.  If the purchase cost cannot be paid, the card cannot be claimed.  If the Spirit Card is a resource card, immediately gain the indicated type of tokens and then discard the card. <br/>4.

Food Phase<br/>-  Each player discards FT equal to their PT. <br/>-  If they are short then roll once on a Starvation Table for each FT they are short and resolve results. <br/>6. Raid Phase<br/>-  Players take turns conducting Raids. <br/>-  Each PT held in reserve conducts its own raid. <br/>-  When making a Raid, declare the target of the Raid: <br/>Target Opponent, Non-player Tribe, or White Men. <br/>-  Roll for results on the appropriate raid table and resolve accordingly.<br/>7. Trade Phase<br/>-  Players may trade Tokens with each other or with white men (using set conversion rates) <br/>8.

It was later released as one of Acornsoft's launch titles for the Acorn Electron in 1983.<br/>Acorn Electron version showing the redesigned characters<br/><br/>In development, the game was titled Puc Man (the first Japanese title of the arcade game was Puck Man) but the name was changed before release to avoid legal action. However, the initial release of the game was so close to Pac-Man (including the design of the game's characters) that this version had to be withdrawn and re-released with the characters changed. The player's character became a round yellow face with very short legs wearing a green cowboy hat and the ghosts became skinny humanoid monsters.<br/><br/>As in Pac-Man, bonus items such as fruit would sometimes appear in the centre of the screen. The highest-scoring bonus item was an acorn, a reference to the publishers. When Snapper was killed, he would shrink and turn into small lines pointing in all directions.<br/><br/>The main difference in gameplay between Pac-Man and Snapper is the behaviour of the ghosts (or monsters). In Pac-Man, each ghost has its own personality and follows set patterns for each level. The red ghost also travels at double speed after a certain number of dots are eaten. In Snapper, the monsters begin each level by patrolling their corners a set number of times before breaking from their route to chase the Snapper. The time before breaking the route is reduced for each level until on later levels, the monsters chase Snapper almost immediately. The only real difference between the monsters is the corner they patrol and how soon they break from their route (e.g. the red ghost is always the first). Also, in Pac-Man, the main character slows when eating dots (so ghosts can catch up to him) but this does not happen in Snapper. These changes lead to a game which is much easier in the early levels but gets progressively more difficult so games tend to last longer.<br/><br/>The game ran very smoothly, making it a popular release of the time. As it was written in machine code, rather than BASIC, it was much closer to the arcade version than earlier commercial releases on the BBC Micro such as Micro Power's Munchyman.<br/><br/>Snapper was also noted for starting the BBC Micro tradition of controlling arcade games using the Z, X, : and / keys for horizontal and vertical motion, since on most BBC models the arrow keys were not conveniently placed for gaming.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapper_%28video_game%29 Snapper (video game)]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "227140": {"poll": [], "name": "S.D.

Each player uses money and influence in order to develop a team of gladiators with the hopes of gaining the most glory in the arena.<br/><br/>The game is split into rounds, each of which is split into two phases. During the machinations phase, players acquire cards to build their decks, and play cards to develop their schools. These cards consist of gladiators, schemes, tactics, and assets which are all used in unique ways to help the player's school gain money, influence, and ultimately glory in the arena. Each turn, a player can either buy a card from the supply, or play a card from his or her hand.<br/><br/>During the arena phase, gladiators which were acquired during the machinations phase fight for their schools in the arena in a bloody contest where only one side survives. Gladiators have attack, HP, and agility stats which determine how much damage they deal, how much punishment they can take, and the order in which they act, respectively. They also each possess a unique ability which can be combined with the abilities of other gladiators to get an edge in combat.<br/><br/>Winning a battle not only provides a player with glory, but also with a boast card to gain even more glory in future rounds. If players aren't careful, boasting could very well reduce their ability to win future battles. The winner is the first player to a certain number of glory points.<br/><br/>"}, "227213": {"rpgartist": ["Bruno Balixa", "Bob Greyvenstein", "William Hendershot", "Michael Jaecks", "Jason Juta", "Chris Kimball", "Tim Kings-Lynne", "Matthew Lewis", "Michal Matczak", "Alyssa Menold", "Beatrice Pelagatti", "Henrik Rosenborg", "Steve Wood (II)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Softcover Version"], "rpgseries": ["Legendary Planet Adventure Path"], "name": "Dead Vault Descent (5E)", "rpgdesigner": ["Clinton Boomer", "Matthew Goodall", "Chris Jackson", "Jeff Lee", "Jason Nelson", "Neil Spicer"], "rpgproducer": ["Savannah Broadway", "Richard Kunz", "Jason Nelson", "Neil Spicer"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3546995.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Legendary Games"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3546995_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>Still seeking a way home, your heroes use their newfound knowledge and a daring heist from the dangerous Thanex Coterie to reactivate a long dormant interplanetary gate.

The game jumps between the planning phase and the actual heist as you play. Players plan their heist together, and then begin the mission. Where it gets interesting, and what really makes it a stand-out game for me is how it handles failure. When a player character fails a roll during the heist, the scene jumps back to the planning phase where it is revealed that the failure was actually part of the group&rsquo;s plan all along. The player explains how this failure was &ldquo;intentional&rdquo; and how it leads to the next phase of the plan just like in so many heist films. Once the characters enter the vault, the game ignores the planning phase, and players have to work against each other as only one of them will be getting out with the money. Using such a clever method for turning failures into successes is for me one of the best approaches to player failure in an RPG and something I&rsquo;d love to see in more games. - Armand Kossayan<br/><br/>"}, "227308": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["200 Word Challenge 2017 plaintext"], "poll": [], "name": "No Coincidence", "rpgdesigner": ["Matt Mortellaro"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["No Coincidence"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpgseries": ["200 Word RPG Challenge 2017"], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Post Apocalypse)"], "description": "Publisher summary<br/>Years ago, the world ended.<br/>Both of us survived. <br/>Both of us are walking across unpopulated lands. <br/>We don't walk alone.<br/><br/>'Judge Comments<br/>I.

Food as a mechanic points out the consumption by the powerful of the remnants of the powerless, and allows for a unique experience while playing. The game demonstrates clearly how powerful colonial cultures consume and appropriate other cultures, and then spit it back out (by talking about it) with their own twists and views on it. The questions provide food for thought on being infected, and how many times conquered cultures begin to assimilate the culture of the conquerors. - Kate Bullock<br/><br/>"}, "227314": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3556839.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Kensei"], "poll": [], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2017", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Emilio Rodriguez"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Zenit Miniatures"], "maxplaytime": "180", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3556839_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Book", "Medieval", "Miniatures", "Mythology", "Wargame"], "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>In this new edition of Kensei the game system has been simplified and livened up, creating new game mechanics that require continuous strategic planning.
