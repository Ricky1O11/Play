It is intended to  be fast-paced and unobtrusive, while still providing an  exciting level of uncertainty and simulation. It is intended  for games in which the exact nature of the rules is really  secondary to telling a good story.<br/><br/>Additionally, the open nature of Stories System was  specifically designed to accommodate rules and  characters taken directly from other (less cool) role- playing games, using the other games' stats exactly as  written or even using no specific stats at all. That way,  a character pulled from, say, a numbers oriented, rules- heavy fantasy game system could stand side by side with  characters from esoteric science fiction settings or story- oriented gothic horror games, and all of these disparate  characters would be able to interact seamlessly within the  Stories System framework.<br/><br/>Stories System is also intended to be flexible and  customizable, allowing it to be adapted for use with a  variety of games and styles.

In Ascension  to Olympus, players are afforded the unique opportunity to play Godlings, the  offspring of gods and mortals, with the ultimate goal of being admitted as a god to Mount Olympus. To become gods, the players must perform heroic deeds and slay menacing beasts,  but they get no credit for their acts unless they are witnessed by the Greek citizens they are  serving. The more people that witness an act of heroic might, the faster that player will  advance towards crossing the gates and enjoying the wine and ambrosia of Olympus. If no  one sees the player's acts, it's as though they never happened. So fight strong, fight brave, but  most importantly, fight where people can see you.<br/><br/>IMPORTANT: Ascension to Olympus is not a standalone game and requires the first edition of Mutants &amp; Masterminds  RPG (hereinafter &quot;M&amp;M&quot;) by Green Ronin Publishing for character creation and combat rules. Even though M&amp;M is a  game of superheroes, it is also perfectly suited to tales of Godlings and monsters.<br/><br/>User comment:<br/>These variant rules for M&amp;M are available as a free download from Animalball Games website.<br/><br/>"}, "97523": {"rpgdesigner": ["Chris Allison", "Stuart Allison", "Mathew Aquino", "Kirby Arinder", "Jonathan Baldridge", "Joe Bardales", "Robert Barrett", "Lon Braidwood", "Colin Chapman", "Bill Dowling", "Alan Dumling", "Justin Dunnuck", "Eric Edwards", "Declan Feeney", "Jon Finn", "Andy Fix", "Ron Frazier", "Tom Hise", "Bryanna Hitchcock", "Joel Hladky", "Dan Houser", "Chris Huff", "Rick Hull", "Liam Jacobs", "Steve Kenson", "Adam Krump", "Douglas Laedtke", "Mike Lafferty", "Alan Legros", "Chris Martzen", "Kevin Mayz", "Joseph Meyer", "Bob Mitchel", "William Olander", "Alyson Olander", "Mike Olson", "Justin Peters", "John Post", "John Powell", "Wayne Ratley", "Rune Reinaas", "Anders Smith", "Jason Sunday", "Paul Vogt", "Andrea Vogt", "Chuck Vogt", "Glenn Williams", "Jeff Zitomer"], "rpg": ["ICONS"], "poll": [], "name": "Hero Pack", "rpgartist": ["Dan Houser"], "rpgproducer": ["Dan Houser", "Gareth-Michael Skarka"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic975966.jpg", "usersrated": "4", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "6.625", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Ad Infinitum Adventures", "Adamant Entertainment"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["ICONS Hero Pack"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic975966_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>In this 90-page PDF, you'll find 120 characters -- heroes and villains alike -- fully statted for ICONS and illustrated in the signature ICONS style by Dan Houser!

They each then turn over two cards that are in different columns.<br/><br/>The goal of Nines is to have the fewest points at game end by getting columns with matching cards (e.g. three 4's in one column). Matching cards in a column essentially &quot;cancels out&quot; that column and the total value of those three cards is zero.<br/><br/>After all cards are dealt, a single card is flipped over from the top of the draw pile. Starting to the left of dealer, a player's turn consists of drawing a single card either from the discard pile or the draw deck. If the player takes a card from the draw deck, they may look at it and either discard it or replace one of the cards in their current play area (can replace either face up or face down). If they choose to replace a card, they have to discard the one they replaced. Taking a card from the discard pile means they have to replace one of their cards, and then discard the one they replaced.<br/><br/>The game end is triggered when one person has all of their cards turned face up. Then, every other person gets one more turn. On this final turn, players do get the option of turning one of their own cards over.<br/><br/>After the game is over, the players turn over any face down cards. If a face down card matches the face up cards in its column, that column of cards counts as zero points. All points are then tallied.<br/><br/>The cards all have different values. Jokers are worth negative three points, aces and kings are both worth zero points, jacks and queens are ten points each, and the numbered cards have point values equal to the number on the card.<br/><br/>"}, "97566": {"poll": [], "name": "Blue Chip", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Commodity Speculation", "Set Collection", "Stock Holding", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "1987", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic976588_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Deuxmark"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic976588.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "This game is concerned with the acquiring of Assets.

Each player has a business, in other words a board with columns for 6 kinds of goods, and a starting capital of $100,000. Each player buys one kind of goods. There are 6 different kinds of goods with various prices. Before a player can buy one kind of goods he must throw a certain number on the dice. When he does so, he can go ahead and buy a maximum of three units of the chosen kind of goods. If the player throws a smaller number, he must then take a card from the pack of random cards and follow the instructions. These can be helpful or unhelpful. Once a player has several kinds of goods he can start selling and by doing so try to make a profit. However, he can sell only goods of one kind each time, and only - as with buying - when he throws the right number on the dice. Once he has thrown this number the bank gives him  the specified selling price which contains a certain profit margin. If the player throws a smaller number, he may not sell and must draw a random card whose instructions he must follow.<br/>What makes the game exciting is that all the players have the chance to bid for goods being bought or sold. In other words, when goods are being bought each player can make his own bid and acquire the goods. The same applies to selling. The specified selling price can be undercut, giving the player an opportunity to find a buyer for his goods. But remember: the purpose is still to make a profit in the end.<br/>The winner is the player who reaches the topmost square with his goods.

Copyright 1984 Peter English. Materials: black and white laminated board featuring a course and cartoon graphics, spinner (you can use a 6 sided die, 34 bonus tabs, 7 cutout figures for bunch and riders, 6 rider cards (Bernard, Eddy, Fausto, Jacques, Sean, Tom - functionally identical). <br/>Riders can be either in &quot;the bunch&quot; or making a break out in front or left behind. When in the bunch the rider figure remains on your card where you also place bonus tabs that are accumulated by reaching certain points in the race first and also when rolling on your turn a 4 or 5 if in the bunch, or 6. Main mechanism is roll and move along a track that includes squares for gaining bonus tabs and penalties that can move you back. The race takes the riders past fans, through an avalanche, past a protest, into a thunderstorm, up the Kremmelburg climb, across cobbles and up the Poggio climb before the finish. Each turn, each player spins the spinner (rolls the die), moves individually or stays in the bunch and and after all players the bunch moves. The bunch always moves three spaces. To break away from the bunch you must roll a 4 or more. A minimum of one rider must remain in the bunch. Generally there can only be up to 2 riders per square (1 on the Kobbleburg climb) and the bunch will swallow you back up if it catches you or leave you off the back if it passes you. Players use their bonus tabs to increase their movement rate or to increase the speed of the bunch when the bunch moves.<br/>The strategy revolves around collecting bonus tabs and deciding when and at which part of the course to make an individual break. The winner is the first rider past the finishing post.<br/><br/>"}, "97625": {"rpgartist": ["Eric Belisle", "Mike Capprotti", "Robert Lazzaretti", "Corey Macourek"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder Roleplaying Game"], "poll": [], "name": "You Only Die Twice", "rpgdesigner": ["R.

Imagine: 815 uniquely designed--and often bizarre--levels, full of action, danger, traps, enemies, secrets, and bonuses. Can you see yourself playing these new levels, trying to survive through all the mystery and excitement? It might take you months--or longer--to play through all of these new levels.<br/><br/>These new levels are not just rehashed editions of the original 60 Wolfenstein levels--we wouldn't do that to you. These new levels are utterly unique and inventive. In fact, they take advantage of features and special tricks that were never used in the original Wolfenstein.<br/><br/>Upgrade #2 - Wolf Creator<br/><br/>You can custom create an unlimited number of new levels!<br/><br/>Apogee has enlisted the help of programmer Alan Hemphill, who has created an incredible program that actually generates challenging levels for Wolfenstein, at the touch of a button!<br/><br/>The program is called Wolf Creator. You simply type &quot;wolfgame&quot;, and you get a menu with several easy choices. If you simply want a standard-style game, you hit a button and within one minute you have 60 new levels! Or, if you want a little more control, you can use the &quot;customize&quot; option and adjust everything to be exactly how you want it. For example, you can have a game without bosses, but packed full of regular guards. Or you can have levels with a dozen killer bosses, ammo everywhere, and health kits, too. With the &quot;customize&quot; option, you are in control of each game you create.<br/><br/>Upgrade #2 - MapEdit<br/><br/>You can design your own devious levels from scratch!<br/><br/>Okay, so you can generate unlimited custom levels using Wolf Creator, but what if you want to design every detail of the levels to play yourself or give to friends? Do you think you can make better levels than in the original Wolfenstein?<br/><br/>There's only one program that gives you absolute control to create your own levels exactly the way you want them. It's called MapEdit.

You will find that you can use any of the Atomik Add-Ons such as Atomik Psioniks or Atomik Magick just as easily with an epic fantasy campaign as with a down and dirty &quot;Old West&quot; adventure.<br/><br/>"}, "97664": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Formless", "rpghonor": ["2004 Indie RPG Awards - Best Free Game - Runner Up"], "rpgproducer": ["Brett M.

In fact, it might be more accurate to say that Formless is a kind of primer for a very specific style of roleplaying. As such, Formless may be utilized as an ideology that can be grafted onto other published roleplaying games. How you apply these ideas to other games is ultimately left up to you, Formless merely establishes a simple framework to get you started.<br/><br/>Formless is designed to be transparent and adaptable. Unconcerned with statistical probability and the crunching of numbers, Formless is designed to facilitate telling stories and having fun, and is largely dependent upon common sense and cooperation between the various players. It is, by default, a collaborative roleplaying framework - that is, a method of roleplaying that splits the usual responsibility of a sole referee among all of the players.<br/><br/>To this end, Formless operates wholly on the good faith assumption that when people sit down to roleplay, they&rsquo;re doing so in the interest of having a good time. Instead of relying on dice, point bidding, or other similar methods used to resolve conflict and create drama, Formless is driven only by words.<br/><br/>"}, "97665": {"poll": [], "name": "Prose With Bros", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iPhone edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Words"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Evil Laugh Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Party"], "videogameplatform": ["iPhone"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Evil Laugh Games"], "description": "This is Prose with Bros, the first ever multiplayer competitive poetry game.

The dealer deals himself 25 playing cards, face-down. If it is being played by more than one, then everyone must have their own pack of cards but they do not deal themselves 25 cards from it. The dealer takes the first card from his stack and announces it to the other players. They then find the declared card in their deck. Now all players simultaneously add it to their own grid. Once one card has been played there are limitations on where the next card can go. The second card must be placed adjacent to the one card already in the grid, vertically, horizentally or diagonall. The third card must be so placed but this will have a little more choice because there is a block of two cards which you can adjoin. And so the game goes on until everyone has a block of 5 x 5 cards, 25 in total.<br/><br/>The scoring is now counted.

Immediately my heart started thumping as I fumbled for the radio transceiver. &quot;Uh&hellip;Charlie, come in&hellip;over.&quot; Wincing at my thorough lack of professionalism and the fact that I practically squeaked the words, I waited for my more experienced partner to respond. When Charlie did answer, it was with his casual drawl, &quot;Go ahead Stevie, what&rsquo;s got your panties all twisted this time?&quot; Ignoring the verbal jab, I quickly mashed the radio&rsquo;s send button, &quot;Charlie, there&rsquo;s a silent alarm going off at the rear entrance to warehouse five!&quot; Charlie responded with a grunted curse, and I could hear his duty belt start to jangle as he broke into a run. &quot;Start recording everything Stevie&quot;, he huffed out, &quot;And get your butt over there to back me up&hellip; Christ! That&rsquo;s the munitions warehouse&hellip;&quot; Great, I thought to myself as I hurried to set the security controls and rush to join my partner. Someone is stealing the high tech weapons&hellip;this should not be happening in the first week of my new job!<br/><br/>Welcome to the Modern Heroes RPG!<br/><br/>Why the Modern Genre?<br/>What is the thing that sets the modern genre of roleplaying games apart from all others? Is it the technology? Perhaps it is the culture? Wait&hellip;it&rsquo;s the guns, right? Well, maybe it is all of those aspects, but perhaps that certain something is more intangible. Perhaps it is the personal knowledge and frame of reference that each of us, as players, bring to the game.<br/><br/>Even those of us who snoozed through some of our classes can bring to mind general knowledge of the geography, politics, pop culture, and even the military, that are all a part of our modern time. Everyone knows that a Ferrari is faster and way cooler than a Kia, and we all know who the latest pop singer in rehab is. Most people can point out New York City on a map, and most know the difference between an AK-47 and an M-16. The point being&hellip;players don&rsquo;t have to learn about new cultures, or the geography of new lands. They don&rsquo;t have to memorize new cultural tendencies or political structures. In the modern setting, these things are already a part of our lives.<br/><br/>Now, with all that general knowledge in place, reinterpret the latest political struggle, or military conflict. Imagine the ruthless underside of organized crime, or the cut-throat environment of corporate espionage. Let your imagination run wild with some gritty urban vigilantism or an overly dramatic gumshoe detective story. Are you starting to see the potential? The background is already provided&hellip;insert blank.<br/><br/>What&rsquo;s so great about this system?<br/>We did not want to reinvent the wheel; we just wanted to make it roll smoother on the modern highway (maybe with some low-pro bling 22&rsquo;s). The rules system in the Modern Hero RPG is, what we feel, an evolutionary step forward for a system that has already proven to be excellent in another genre. Thanks to the wonderful OGL, we admit that most of the work was already done. What we have focused on is making a system that is versatile, as is fitting for the modern times.<br/><br/>Because of globalization, characters in a modern setting should not be &ldquo;pigeon-holed&rdquo; into classes or areas of knowledge. We offer only one base class &ndash; the Modern Hero, a framework upon which to build. It is then up to the player to build his own unique character, and to have the freedom to shape that character as it advances through the levels of experience. So, versatility and freedom of choice&hellip; Let&rsquo;s make that our hallmark.<br/><br/>"}, "97720": {"poll": [], "name": "Flightmare", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American DOS edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic989007.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Flight", "Science Fiction", "War - Future"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic989007_t.jpg", "description": "Flightmare is a 1984 computer game by Peter Adams. It tells the story of the Omegans, who are at war with the Vandals. In the game, the player controls an Omegan pilot who is being ambushed by Vandal pilots, motorcyclists, and truck drivers.<br/><br/>The format of the game has two different modes. The first is a very large scale view in which the player navigates a plane to target the next battle. Tiny icons represent the enemy planes, motorcycles, and trucks, as well as the Omegan plane, airfield (representing the remaining planes), some factories, and a blimp used for reloading ammunition.<br/><br/>The second mode is a tactical, split-screen view including a side view and a top down view, with different controls to maneuver the plane on each view. It is in this mode that the actual battle takes place, where the player must shoot down enemy planes without being shot down, or shoot motorcycles or truck tires without hitting the ground.<br/><br/>A wise player would protect his factories and airfield from the motorbikes and trucks, which destroy those structures upon contact. Once these ground vehicles are gone, a heat-seeking rocket is launched, targeting the player mercilessly. Destroying the rocket ends the wave.<br/><br/>At the end of each wave, the player is granted extra planes based on any remaining factories. The waves are designated by letters of the Greek alphabet. Once all the player's planes are destroyed, the game is over, and a rank is assigned corresponding to the highest wave reached: Alpha Turkey, Beta Beginer [sic], Gamma Greenhorne [sic], etc.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Flightmare&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "97721": {"poll": [], "name": "Free Falcon", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "7", "videogameseries": ["Falcon"], "videogametheme": ["Flight", "Military", "War - Modern"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamecharacter": ["General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"], "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Flight Simulator"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "vgcharacterversion": ["General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Free Falcon is a community build freeware simulation of primarily the F-16 Fighting Falcon, though a number of other jets can be flown.

Originally developed for the Atari 8-bit computer system in 1982, it was later ported to a number of platforms including the VIC-20, Commodore 64, TRS-80 Color Computer, TI-99/4A, IBM PC and Nintendo Game Boy Color; several of these ports were made by Atarisoft. It was followed by a sequel Shamus: Case II, available on the Atari and C64.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Inspired by the arcade game Berzerk, the objective of the game is to navigate the eponymous robotic detective through a 4-skill level, 128-room maze of electrified walls. Touching one of the electrified walls results in instantaneous death for the player, and the loss of a life.  Upon the completion of each level, the gameplay speeds up, increasing the chances of running into a wall. The ultimate goal at the end of this journey is &quot;The Shadow's Lair.&quot;<br/><br/>Opposing the player are a number of robotic adversaries, including spiral drones, robo droids and snap jumpers. Shamus is armed with 'Ion SHIVs'...SHIV being an acronym for Short High Intensity Vaporizer...and is able to hurl up to two at a time at his enemies.<br/><br/>The main gameplay involves clearing the room of all enemies, picking up special items on the way and then leaving through an exit. Upon returning to the room, the enemies are regenerated and returned to their original positions. The player is attacked if he or she spends too much time in a room, as occurs in the similar arcade game Berserk. In this case, the Shadow himself emerges from off-screen and hops directly at Shamus, unhindered by the walls.<br/><br/>The game differs from Berzerk in that the player may pick up items along the way - for example, bottles containing extra lives, mystery question marks, and keys which would open exits, thus expanding the game area.<br/><br/>The game was unique in that its combination of locks and keys required the player to complete each of its four levels in a particular order. To complete the game in its entirety would take several hours, which combined with the lack of a pause function, the necessity of remembering the location of dozens of rooms and keys, and the frenetic gameplay meant that this was extremely difficult to accomplish.<br/><br/>The game was also notable for using Funeral March of a Marionette, the well-known theme song from Alfred Hitchcock Presents.<br/><br/>Trivia<br/><br/>The various maze layouts are all named after famous fictional detectives or agents, such as &quot;Clouseau&quot;, &quot;Marlowe&quot;, &quot;Holmes&quot; or &quot;Bond&quot;.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Shamus (computer game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "97727": {"poll": [], "name": "World Class Football", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Point to Point Movement", "Simulation"], "yearpublished": "1983", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Football / Soccer"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1230421_t.jpg", "average": "8.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Football International"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1230421.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Football International English First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Sports"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "A soccer simulation from Football International.<br/>Contents: Board with a pitch divided into 5 zones, an acetate overlay to show teams moving up and down the pitch, 40 action cards, 12 defense cards, 3 dice, ball marker, team sets with 15 individual player cards and a team roster card.<br/>Basic game sequence:<br/>1) Take an action card corresponding to the zone of the pitch the ball is in.

Cities take a particular number of turns to produce the various units. As players expand from the first city, they use their units to find and capture additional cities and become able to produce a greater number of unit types. Players explore the world, capturing cities as they are found and using them to build more military units. Early versions were text-based, while later versions of the game added graphics.<br/><br/>Bright's first version was written around 1977 in the FORTRAN programming language for the PDP-10 computer at Caltech. This version was spread virally to other PDP-10s, which were common timesharing systems at the time. Later, Bright recoded this in assembly language on a Heathkit H-11 and made it available commercially. He sold two copies.<br/><br/>At some point, someone broke through the security systems at Caltech, and took a copy of the source code for the FORTRAN/PDP-10 version of the game. This code was continually modified, being passed around from person to person.<br/><br/>Eventually, it was found on a computer in Massachusetts by Herb Jacobs and Dave Mitton. They ported the code to the VAX/VMS operating system and, under the alias of &quot;Mario DeNobili and Paulson&quot; submitted the program to DECUS, a large user's group. DECUS programs were often installed on new DEC computers at the time of delivery, and so Empire propagated further. Eventually, Bright heard of this, and in 1983 contacted DECUS, who subsequently credited Bright in the catalog description of the program and re-added his name to the source code.<br/><br/>In 1984, Bob Norby, from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, ported the DECUS version from the VAX to the PC, producing Empire 5.0, and Empire 5.1 (Color Supported), which required the ANSI.SYS driver. Mr Norby wrote:<br/><br/>&quot;This program is a war game simulation for video terminals. It is distributed by DECUS on DEC computers. While working for a company with a VAX, I became addicted to the game. When I left that company, it was necessary to find another way to continue playing. So I implemented the game on the PC.&quot;<br/><br/>It was released as shareware, and found its way into many shareware collections, and was propagated into BBSs in the late 1980s and early 1990s.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Empire (computer game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "97741": {"videogame": ["Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe (CD compilation)"], "poll": [], "name": "Tour of Duty: He 162 Volksj\u00e4ger", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["5 1/4\" DOS Edition", "North American DOS 3.5\" Disk edition", "US DOS Dual Media edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1436585.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Lucasfilm WWII Air Combat"], "videogametheme": ["Alternate Historical", "Flight", "Military", "War - World War II"], "usersrated": "4", "videogamecharacter": ["Heinkel He 162 Volksj\u00e4ger"], "videogameexpansion": ["Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe"], "videogamedeveloper": ["LucasArts"], "videogamegenre": ["Flight Simulator"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS"], "average": "8.5", "statistics": [], "videogamecompilation": ["Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe (CD compilation)"], "videogamepublisher": ["LucasArts"], "vgcharacterversion": ["Heinkel He 162 Volksj\u00e4ger"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1436585_t.jpg", "description": "Description from Box<br/><br/>Hitler's last stab at controlling the skies!<br/><br/>Its design was radical.

It was inspired by the arcade game Targ.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>In Crossfire, the player uses the keyboard or a joystick to move left, right, up and down among an array of blocks, avoiding incoming fire and dispatching enemies. The playing area consists of 42 blocks (7 rows by 6 columns), through which there are six vertical alleys, five horizontal alleys, and 30 intersections. The player can move and fire in any of the four directions, but can only stop in intersections.<br/><br/>Along the left, right and top sides of the playing area are 16 pockets, each of which holds four enemies, one of each variety. These enemies emerge and move among the blocks, firing at and attempting to collide with the player. The enemies differ only in appearance, not in power or behavior. Like the player, the enemies can move and fire in any direction, but aren't as fast. Unlike the player, they never run out of ammunition.<br/><br/>Within four blocks near the middle of the playing area are four bonus items. Over the course of a level, each one briefly emerges before going back into its block. Capturing the bonus items grants 100, 200, 400 and 800 points.<br/><br/>The player can fire only a limited number of shots before having to reload. In early rounds this number is around 30, but drops as the levels progress. When ammunition runs low, a cluster of four pulsing white dots appears (usually at the most distant intersection) marking where the player needs to go to reload.<br/><br/>Play begins with three ships; an extra one is awarded every 5,000 points. The level ends when all the enemies are destroyed.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Crossfire (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "97786": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic979889.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Small World"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Philippe Keyaerts"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Miguel Coimbra", "Cyrille Daujean"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Days of Wonder", "Edge Entertainment", "Giochi Uniti", "Hobby Japan", "REBEL.pl"], "boardgameintegration": ["Small World", "Small World"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic979889_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Fantasy", "Fighting", "Territory Building"], "description": "&quot;This world's not big enough for all of us, so it's time you step aside to make room for me.&quot;<br/><br/>That's the spirit of Philippe Keyaerts' award-winning Small World, and the 2011 release Small World Underground is a standalone game that keeps that spirit intact, while putting a new spin on the game play.<br/><br/>Small World Underground includes 15 fantasy-themed races of creatures along with 21 special powers.

It was based on a 1981 Apple II game called Sabotage which was developed by Mark Allen.<br/><br/>Description<br/><br/>The player controls a gun turret located at the center of the bottom of the screen. The turret can swivel to fire on a large portion of the screen, but it cannot move from its base. The gun can fire multiple shots at once.<br/><br/>Helicopters frequently fly at varying heights across the top portion of the screen, dropping paratroopers as they go. The paratroopers may be disintegrated by a direct hit, or their parachutes may be shot, in which case they will plummet to earth (splattering and dying if they were sufficiently high when hit). Furthermore, destroyed helicopters turn into shrapnel, which may destroy other helicopters or paratroopers.<br/><br/>Periodically, jets will fly by and drop bombs in an attempt to destroy the player's gun turret; the jets and bombs may be shot as well.<br/><br/>The player earns points by shooting helicopters, paratroopers, jets, and bombs. Firing a shell costs the player one point, so if one is playing for score, there is an incentive to conserve ammo.<br/><br/>The game ends when the player's turret is hit by a bomb or when a single paratrooper lands directly on the turret. The game may also end if the paratroopers are able to assault the gun turret. This happens after four paratroopers land safely in the territory on either the left left or right side of the turret (that is four on one side, not four total between both sides). The four paratroopers are then able to build a human pyramid so that one can climb on top of the turret and blow it up.<br/><br/>In 1992, Software Creations released a DOS remake of the game called Night Raid.

How to find out which nephew should be rich? You will each be given a large amount of money and whoever can spend it first will be the rightful heir. Visit the most exclusive theatres or eat in the most expensive restaurants. Buy old properties for the price of new ones and sell them as ruins. Host a huge party in your mansion or on your private boat. Spend like your life would depend on it. Spend to become rich! If you're the first to run through the money on hand, you'll receive the rest of his inheritance &ndash; oh, and win the game.<br/><br/>In Last Will, each player starts with a certain amount of money, an individual player board, two errand boys and two cards in some combination of properties and helpers. At the start of each round, lay out cards from the appropriate decks on the offering boards; the four regular decks are properties, companions, events, helpers and expenses, with special cards forming a deck of their own. The particular mix of cards varies by round and by the number of players.<br/><br/>Each player then chooses a plan for the round, with each plan indicating the number of cards the player draws (drawn immediately from the four regular decks in any combination), how many errand boys he can use later (one or two), the number of actions available to him that round, and his spot in the playing order that round. In the playing order for that round, players then take turns choosing an action with their errand boy(s), with those actions being:<br/><br/><br/>    Take a card on display and add it to your hand.<br/>    Draw a card from any regular deck &ndash; This can be chosen only once by each player.<br/>    Visit the opera and spend $2.<br/>    Adjust the value modifiers in the property market.<br/>    Take a player board extension, thereby giving you room to play more cards.<br/><br/><br/>Players then take actions in the playing order for that round, with each player having as many actions as indicated on his plan. Actions let you play one-time events (which have a cost, possibly variable); helpers and recurring expenses (which are placed on your individual player board); and properties (which cost money and may depreciate over time). You can often play companions with events or recurring expenses &ndash; of course you should bring a date to the opera or a horse on your yacht! &ndash; to increase their cost. You can also use actions to activate cards on your player board, possibly with one or more companions and always with the goal of spending money.

Faction Wars is set in the not-too-distant future, so some of the technology and weapons will be familiar, but with plenty of added science fiction to bring the universe to life.<br/><br/>The human race has escaped the clutches of Earth and colonised the galaxy. The invention of wormhole technology has allowed the vast gulfs of empty space to be crossed. However, this vastness is also leading to the downfall of the Commonwealth. The supreme political figure is the High Guardian, who is losing control over the rapidly expanding wave of colonisation.

Thus Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic games, invented the Modern Pentathlon based on the ideal soldier of his time, recreating the experience of a 19th century cavalry soldier behind enemy lines: running, swimming, riding, and fighting (with pistol and sword).  In the vein of Reiner Knizia's Decathlon, this is a collection of dice games loosely based off the real-life events.<br/><br/>The five events capture a wide spectrum dice game mechanics, including push-your-luck, calculated risks, bluffing, and set collection.  Players who have read Dr. Knizia's book Dice Games Properly Explained will find the events draw upon various traditional games, but combine and develop their mechanics to place more emphasis on decisions than luck.  For example, in the 200m Freestyle Swimming and Pistol Shooting events, players may continually purchase rerolls to mitigate bad luck but should consider the trade-off of how much that would benefit their opponents.  In Epee Fencing, players always have exactly 7 points to allocate each round, and so the event is more about bluff and discerning their opponent's actions.<br/><br/>"}, "97867": {"rpgartist": ["Dave Allsop"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Softcover Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Ursa Carrien", "rpgdesigner": ["James Desborough"], "rpgproducer": ["Dave Allsop", "Jared Earle", "Merci Reed"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3091700.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Horror", "Science Fiction"], "rpgpublisher": ["Nightfall Games"], "rpg": ["SLA Industries"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Threat Analysis"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3091700_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>A new threat has surfaced in Cannibal Sector 2 and it's hungry .<br/><br/>The first of the Data Packets for SLA Industries from Nightfall Games, this six-page PDF contains a creature and a BPN for a group of operatives to prove their worth to the company.<br/><br/>"}, "97868": {"rpgdesigner": ["Dave Allsop"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Softcover Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Klick's End", "rpgartist": ["Dave Allsop"], "rpgproducer": ["Dave Allsop", "Jared Earle", "Merci Reed"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3091710.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Horror", "Science Fiction"], "rpgpublisher": ["Nightfall Games"], "rpg": ["SLA Industries"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Threat Analysis"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3091710_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>Klick's End - a Downtown area that SLA has left to rot.

In 1895, exploring Amazonia, Auguste Copperpot discovered a gate to a lost valley, occupied by a primitive civilisation. Wiraqocha Valley was the name he gave to this remote Eden. This world enclosed a treasure that was going to revolutionize modern sciences, namely the Somnium, an orange luminescent crystal showing amazing properties. It can be used as fuel, affects matter and even time. Immediately, this virgin land became a new Eldorado for European colonists. Empress Victoria II decided to send several conglomerates to share this promised land and reap the fruits to her benefit. Zeppelin fleet, full of scientists, adventurers and looters, clouded the Atlantic sky.<br/><br/>Wiraqocha Valley is represented by an adjustable board consisting of 22 hexagonal tiles, each of them being identified by a number from 1 to 12, or a dice combo (pairs or straights). In his turn, each player rolls some six-sided dice, combining them to take possession of territories, or to protect from the opponents the ones he already owns. Every hexagon affords resources or special capacities, which are means to influence die results to fit one&rsquo;s strategy. There are three ways to win: bring back a huge cargo of Somnium to the Empress; acquire enough scientific knowledge to build the Leviathan, a terrifying weapon serving the Kingdom; or find in the temple depths the four relics that will allow you to reach Wiraqocha&rsquo;s treasure.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Japanese edition", "Multilingual first edition"], "average": "6.66101", "name": "Wiraqocha", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Area Control / Area Influence", "Dice Rolling", "Modular Board", "Set Collection", "Worker Placement"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["Wiraqocha: Scrolls of Quezacoatl", "Wiraqocha: The Way of the Feathered Serpent"], "usersrated": "418", "boardgameaccessory": ["Wiraqocha: Real Somnium from Wiraqocha"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Brazil", "Steampunk"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The Spiel at Essen 2011 - Wiraqocha"]}, "97876": {"rpgdesigner": ["Scott Corum"], "rpg": ["Hot Chicks"], "poll": [], "name": "Hot Chicks 3.1: Naked Distress", "rpgartist": ["Scott Corum"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure", "Adult / Mature"], "rpgpublisher": ["Dakkar Unlimited"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["Hot Chicks \"Standie\" miniatures"], "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>It's time to set out the battle map.

To win you must use your resources wisely to construct 12 victory points worth of buildings along the Shale River which runs through the different quarters of the City of Iron.<br/><br/>Needed to play: the deck of 34 cards and 35 markers per player in 2 colors.<br/><br/>Setup: Place the 4 Quarter Cards comprising the map of the Shale River between players.<br/><br/>The 4 quarters of the city each have 6 buildings on them that can be constructed by players. Each building is worth 1 victory point towards the goal of 12. Further, each building allows players to use the special power of that quarter of the city to place more workers, distribute resources or purchase cards in the game.<br/><br/>Next each player takes a set of the 5 Industry Cards: Foundry, Trade Guild, Civil Service, Builders and Shipwrights and places them below their side of the river.<br/><br/>Industry Cards are used to construct the buildings along the river by placing resources on the 5 icons on each card. Once enough resources have been accrued, players may construct one of the buildings, though each industry type only constructs one or two particular types of building based on which Quarter Cards the industries are adjacent to.<br/><br/>Next each player takes a set of the 4 Resource Cards: Brick Kiln, Textile Mill, Lumbermill and Smelter. Players shuffle these cards and randomly lay them out below the Industry Cards. Place the Contract Card within reach of both players. Then lay out the 11 Upgrade Cards face up within reach of both players.<br/><br/>Lastly, players each take 4 of their 30 eurocube markers and place them on four icons on any of their Industry Cards. Players may only place a marker on one each of the four resource types. Each card shows icons for a different resource type used in the game to construct the buildings and purchase upgrade cards.<br/><br/>Play: Steam Lords is divided into rounds of four phases. Players take turns during phases 1, 3 and 4, and play simultaneously during phase 2. Players will alternate going first between rounds, with Player One going first in the first round, Player Two going first in the 2nd round, etc... Once all 4 phases have been completed, a new round begins.<br/><br/>Phase 1: Contract<br/>Players take turns placing 5 workers (eurocube markers) on the Contract Card claiming either resources or distribution rights.<br/>Phase 2: Distribute<br/>Players simultaneously distribute resources, moving markers from the Resource Cards to the Industry Cards.<br/>During this phase, each player may &lsquo;deliver&rsquo; any resources for a total of 5 card units in distance. To calculate distance, count the number of cards up and over to the left or right you wish to move a resource.<br/>Phase 3: Build<br/>Players take turns constructing buildings on the Quarter Cards if they have all 5 resources needed on their Industry Cards.<br/>If a player has all 5 icons marked on an Industry Card, they may remove those markers and construct any of the unclaimed buildings on a Quarter Card. Once all 6 buildings have been constructed no more can be claimed. Each building built on a Quarter Card is worth 1VP.<br/>Phase 4: Upgrade<br/>Players take turns buying Upgrade Cards one at a time, and may only buy Upgrade Cards if they have built buildings in Coalside during phase 3. For each building built in Coalside, a player may buy 1 Upgrade Card during this phase. To purchase an Upgrade Card, a player must pay the number of resources shown at the bottom of each Upgrade Card. They may then take the card and place it in front of them.<br/><br/>Four of the Upgrade Cards allow players to store additional resources on the Resource Cards. After purchasing one of the four cards replace the existing Resource Card with the new one. Each of these cards is worth 2VP. Seven of the Upgrade Cards let you construct building with fewer resources, gain distribution units or place more workers in phase 1. The cards list their respective upgrades.<br/><br/>An expanded set of 12 additional cards has also been included for a longer game.<br/><br/>Artscow direct order - <a target='_blank' href='http://www.artscow.com/gallery/playing-cards/steam-lords-wym0ul1sbgjg' rel='nofollow'>http://www.artscow.com/gallery/playing-cards/steam-lords-wym...</a><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "age": "10", "name": "Steam Lords", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pick-up and Deliver", "Worker Placement"], "average": "6.65", "usersrated": "10", "boardgamefamily": ["Forgenext"]}, "97899": {"poll": [], "name": "Zubo", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Australian Nintendo DS edition", "English/European Nintendo DS edition", "Japanese Nintendo DS edition", "North American Nintendo DS edition"], "average": "5", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["EA Bright Light"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Rhythm"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo DS"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Electronic Arts (EA)"], "description": "Zubo is a rhythm-action videogame developed by EA Bright Light Studios for Nintendo DS.

On a turn you take two actions from four possibilities, repeating an action if desired:<br/><br/><br/>    Move: Pick up your monster body, flick the paws disc, then place the body back on the disc.<br/>    Demolish: If your paws are on the sidewalk surrounding a building, you can pick up your monster body, drop it onto a building, then collect any floors that have no meeples on them.<br/>    Toss a vehicle: If you're in a neighborhood with a vehicle, you can pick up the vehicle, place it on your body, then flick the vehicle at a building or another monster.<br/>    Breathe: Even while away from sidewalks with no vehicles, you can cause destruction by placing your chin on your monster's body and blowing across the board.<br/><br/><br/>Monsters tend to be messy when obtaining meals, but if you knock meeples off the city board, you might be punished for letting food go to waste, costing you a tooth or letting other players take an additional action. After your two actions, you can eat unprotected meeples on the ground in your neighborhood, but you can eat only as many as the number of teeth you have. If you knock another monster to the ground, you break off one of its teeth, thereby keeping it from stealing your food! Meeples come in six colors, with the colors representing different types of inhabitants: blue (journalists), green (military), yellow (blondes), grey (old people), red (heroes), and black (businessmen). For each set of six you collect in your stomach, you score 10 points at game's end. You score points for collecting floors and teeth, too, and you can also score for achieving the goal on your character card.<br/><br/>In addition to the character card, each player has a power card and a superpower card unique to his monster, with the former lasting the entire game and the latter being a one-shot effect that's revealed only upon use.<br/><br/>Terror in Meeple City includes rules for monsters that evolve over the course of the game, that lose points for meeples not in sets, and that want to combine two game boards to allow for play with up to eight players.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition", "English Rebrand edition", "Multilingual first edition"], "average": "6.96624", "name": "Terror in Meeple City", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Set Collection", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": ["Terror in Meeple City: The Space Cowboys"], "usersrated": "5683", "boardgameaccessory": ["Rampage: Meeple Sticker"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Finger Flicking Games", "Kaiju", "Monsters"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["AP Podcast \u2013 Episodio 12: Ascension Rise of Vigil", "Ep. 14 Dexerity Games", "Episode 19: Rampage/Game Mechanics", "Episode 1: Troyes, Willow, and Warhammer Quest", "Episode 21 -- Rant!

The gameplay featured many unique aspects for a third-person shooter of the time it was released, most notably making each level an extremely large, expansive area that requires sometimes hours of involved exploration to locate the babies and get rid of the enemies. (Examples include a giant construction site and an entire section of a large city, complete with buildings to explore, including a complete museum of modern art.) Maneuvering through these levels often requires careful observation of the environment so as not to get lost, as well as solving puzzles to figure out where some babies might be hidden or how to gain access to more of the level.
