The game's art style will be heavily influenced by the silver age of comic books, such as the work by Jack Kirby, as well as by the more recent comic creator Bruce Timm.

Each stage also contains 3 hidden diamonds; these play the role of the power stars in Mario 64, in that that certain stages requires a certain number of diamonds in order to be unlocked. Each stage also contains a special &quot;achievement&quot;, the requirements of which are revealed the first time the stage is cleared (&quot;Clear the stage without taking damage&quot;, &quot;Collect 70 coins&quot;, &quot;Find the hidden mushroom&quot;). Completing this achievement and taking the three diamonds causes the stage to get a &quot;done&quot; stamp, and when all stages in a batch (typically 18 stages in a batch) are &quot;done&quot;, each stage in the batch can be time-challenged.<br/><br/>"}, "161019": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Mario Party 10", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"243512": "Australian Wii U edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2976170.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5133": "Mario Party"}, "videogametheme": {"2403": "Board Game"}, "videogamefranchise": {"4868": "Super Mario"}, "average": "7.27778", "videogamegenre": {"2338": "Party"}, "videogameplatform": {"10763": "Wii U"}, "usersrated": "9", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2976170_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Mario Party 10 (Japanese: \u30de\u30ea\u30aa\u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30a310 Hepburn: Mario P\u0101ti Ten) is an upcoming party video game developed and published by Nintendo for Wii U. It is the tenth main game in the Mario Party series, the fourteenth overall, and the first game in the series for Wii U.<br/><br/>Mario Party 10 continues the tradition of the Mario Party series, in which four players, controlled by either human or CPU, compete against each other on a game board by participating in various minigames. At least one board will feature the same play style introduced in Mario Party 9, in which all four players travel across the board together. Along with the standard competitive modes, Mario Party 10 introduces a new mode called Bowser Party, in which a fifth player controls Bowser using the Wii U GamePad. In this mode, the four main players are tasked with reaching the end of the board without losing all of their hearts whilst avoiding being caught by Bowser, who is trying to stop them. If Bowser catches up to the other players, a minigame takes place in which Bowser uses the GamePad's features to activate various devices, such as tilt controlled fire rods, pinball flippers, and a spinning wheel, whilst the other players attempt to take as little damage as possible. The players win if at least one player makes it to the end of the board with their hearts intact, but if all players are defeated, Bowser wins.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Mario Party 10&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "161020": {"rpgitemversion": {"243514": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Johan's Lost Vault", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2204361.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"25107": "Filbar"}, "rpgproducer": {"74343": "Frank Schmidt"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"13236": "AD&D First Edition (1e) Compatible Products"}, "average": "0", "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"24828": "Adventures in Filbar"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2204361_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>At one time the City of Tygos was a bustling metropolis located in the southeastern portion of the Plains of Dorack. Sitting in the shadow of the Dorack Mountains this city flourished as a trading metropolis. Decades ago the leaders of the city, the Serpentine Cultists, began a racially charged campaign against certain factions of the Plainsmen tribes. The resulting response of the Plainsmen was devastating to Tygos and the city was levelled for the most part and the water supply was poisoned. The city was also home to a group of adventurers called JOHAN and their fortress was said to contain powerful ancient magic that was never recovered. If these items can be located the resulting power can bring continued success to your party&rsquo;s wealth and fame.<br/><br/>This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for a mid to high level group of adventurers and DM.

The lean, quick babau are the assassins of the underworld, born of serial murderers, and so inherently wretched that their skin constantly weeps an acidic ichor that covers their entire body. The hulking hezrou, by comparison, is a powerful abyssal heavyweight that corrupts and warps everything it touches, and pollutes the very world around it.

Mythic babau are expert assassins who not only excel at making powerful, deadly sneak attacks, even when others would not be able to, but also are invigorated by making a bloody kill, and gain the ability to spit blobs of clinging acid at their foes from afar. Mythic hezrou, by contrast, can cause bodies to twist, warp, and putrefy with a single touch, can surround themselves with a deadly miasma of toxic gases to punish those who would dare approach them, and can even corrupt entire landscapes in a 10-mile radius with their mere presence. In addition to these game statistics, the book also introduces rules for performing special rituals that can be enacted by players of any class in order to summon mythic babau and mythic hezrou, with both specific game rules for doing so and detailed flavorful descriptions.<br/><br/>"}, "161034": {"rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Small Dungeons #01", "rpgproducer": {"37664": "Mark A.

Pass each deck counter-clockwise to next player for reshuffling until it goes back to the designated player.<br/><br/>2. Place Leader Card Each player must place their leader Card in the field (playmat designated area). A Leader Card starts with 30 Health Points. (If a leader&rsquo;s life points drops to zero, that player is eliminated from the game).<br/><br/>3. Determine Play Order    Randomly select which player will go first. After the first player&rsquo;s turn, player turn order will resume in a counter-clockwise direction.<br/><br/>4. Draw Hand Cards    All players must draw 6 cards from their chosen deck. Every play turn, players can draw 2 cards in their library. All players can assign up to 2 cards on the mining placement area which will produce 1 gold per card per turn. The more cards assigned to the mining area, the more gold it produces. However, re-assigning the cards/using the cards from the mining area has an additional cost of 4 gold.

Each action must be completed in the order designated below. In a free-for-all game, the player chosen to go first takes their turn. Next, in a consecutive order (going in a counter-clockwise direction), the other players will fulfill their turns.<br/><br/>1.    Re-draw (Optional) A player can elect to declare a Re-Draw action at the start of their turn. This action is performed in place of any of the regular actions associated with a typical turn. When a player has no useful cards in their hand, they can choose to use the Re-draw action. The Re-Draw action allows a player to discard their hand of cards and draw 6 new cards from their deck. This action ends their turn. The player is not allowed to take any more actions, and will not be able to produce any Gold until their next turn. Note: If you don&rsquo;t need to Re-Draw, skip this action and take a normal turn. Simply begin your turn with the collect Gold action and precede through the subsequent action steps until you wrap up your turn with the Upkeep action.<br/><br/>2.    Collect Gold Collect the amount of Gold equal to the total Gold on all of the cards placed on the mining area.<br/><br/>3.    Draw Card Draw 2 cards from your Race deck.<br/><br/>4.    Activate Cards This action lets you establish and activate any type of cards, use    Command cards, and/or assign new units.    During this play sequence, a player may perform all four of these options: - Play 2 Card to the mining field. Note: All cards in the mining field should be placed facedown. - Play any number of Passive and Instant Command Cards.    - Play any unit cards to assign any number of new units on the left/right flank.<br/><br/>5.    Re-assign Once the unit is re-assigned from mining area to any of the field flank, it cannot go back to the mining area. However, once a unit is assigned to any flank, you can re-assign it the other flank with a cost of 2 gold.<br/><br/>For further information of the game's &quot;How to play&quot;, please download the game's Rule Book.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"243718": "The Beginning"}, "age": "12", "name": "Blood Oath: The Beginning", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2664": "Deck / Pool Building"}, "average": "7", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "161138": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2062234.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"72083": {"name": "Ludovic Barbe"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"12130": "Vincent Dutrait"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5022": {"name": "Blue Orange (EU)"}}, "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2062234_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "description": "In Dragon Run, the players have just raided a dragon's keep, picked up a bunch of loot, and awakened the dragon. Now it's time to flee, ideally making it out with both our treasures and our lives.<br/><br/>On each turn, a player can either advance boldly, flee cautiously, or cry like a baby. If you advance boldly, you draw a card from the location deck, which holds three types of cards: one that allows that player to either redraw or stop, one that grants new treasure from the treasure hall, and (of course) the dragon. If you draw the dragon, you lose one health point (out of two), the dragon calms down (i.e., it loses one temper point), and the location deck is reshuffled. If you're injured twice, you die and are out of the game.<br/><br/>When fleeing cautiously, you first discard a treasure worth at least one coin, then roll a d10. If your roll is higher than the number of cards in the location deck, the dragon calms down, then you reshuffle the location deck; otherwise you must draw a card from the location deck just as when someone advances boldly. Your sacrificed treasure is still lost.<br/><br/>When you cry like a baby, you don't draw a location card, instead discarding a treasure worth at least two coins. Having shown your obeisance to the dragon, the turn passes to the next player.<br/><br/>Players start with four treasure cards; while some cards are worth 1-5 coins, others provide a one-shot potion or a talisman that stays in effect until the location deck is shuffled, which ends the round. Gameplay lasts from 5 to 8 rounds. Each player has a unique power that can be used once per round: the thief can steal cards from opponents, the cleric can heal opponents in exchange for treasure, etc. If the dragon loses its final temper point, the game ends and whoever holds the most valuable treasure wins; if all of the adventurers are charred to death first, then the dragon wins instead!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"264365": "English first edition"}, "age": "8", "name": "Dragon Run", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": {"2661": "Press Your Luck"}, "average": "6.19237", "usersrated": "262", "boardgamefamily": {"7005": "Animals: Dragons"}}, "161139": {"boardgamedesigner": {"56321": {"name": "Hamish Sterling"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Pocket Rugby League", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": {"5573": "Sports: Rugby"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2054571_t.jpg", "average": "6.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"17797": {"name": "Pocket Sports"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2054571.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"243720": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Pocket Rugby League is head smashing, scrum packing, ball and all Rugby - played with dice.<br/> We've made this game to give plenty of scoring chances...in fact, not scoring in an attacking raid might be more painful than the huge hits throughout the game.<br/> The gameplay focuses on each side taking turns in an attacking set of 6 tackles.<br/> You are in control of 5 playing positions - the scrum half always starts each passage of play.

Doing so allows you to expend resources in order to add buildings, statuary, bill boards, and groups throughout the city. These installations expand your influence, giving you control of city sectors.<br/><br/>The first player to control a predetermined number of city sectors wins the game.<br/><br/>ENACTING AGENDA<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player selects a faction-oriented Agenda Card to put into play. This is called enacting an agenda.<br/><br/>Agenda Cards list five different types of Missions your agents must complete. Once they have completed three or more different missions from the list, the agenda is considered realized, and you are awarded a specified number of Influence Points. These points can then be spent on placing installations on the game board.<br/><br/>COMPLETING MISSIONS<br/><br/>Mission Cards list five different types of Actions our agents must complete while in neutral- or enemy-controlled locations. Once three or more different actions from the list are completed, the mission is completed. You gain the listed benefits from the mission, and the Mission Card is then placed face-up under the Agenda Card (for scorekeeping purposes).<br/><br/>COMPLETING ACTIONS<br/><br/>Each agent in the game has a primary function; such as: eliminating, seducing, capturing, corrupting, or turning enemy agents. To perform its function, an agent must be in a city sector, or sector location, that contains a keyword matching the same keyword on the agent's card.<br/><br/>CyberPsi utilizes polyhedron. An action attempt may require you to roll 1d4 or 1d12 to determine how many Action Points an agent musters when attempting the action. Asset Cards that are equipped to the agent sometimes adds to an action attempt's Action Point total.<br/><br/>Thus, a Rank 1 Hacker in a location with the keyword INTERFACE may try to &quot;Steal (1) Data Card from target enemy Database.&quot; The Action Point Value needed to successfully perform this action is (12). In order to be able to reach this, you roll 1d8 (as indicated on his card) and add (2) Action Points provided by his &quot;Jac-in-Boxx&quot; Asset Card and (1d4) Action Points provided by his &quot;Virtualization Headgear&quot; Asset Card. The total number of Action Points your Hacker gets is (13), which exceeds the target value of (12). Thus, the action attempt is successful, and your agents enables you to take anyone Data Card from the target player's Database.<br/><br/>RESOURCES<br/><br/>During the course of the game, you will assign agents to undertake activities that generate resources. You can then expend these resources to put other agents into play, to buy Asset Cards, and to unlock cards that can be placed into your draw deck.<br/><br/>COMBAT<br/><br/>Combat in CyberPsi is resolved by rolling each combatant's die type (d4, d6, d8, etc), adding any modifiers provided by Asset Cards, and comparing the results to each other. Damage is determined and applied, and the battle continues or ends, depending on combat situational factors.<br/><br/>Some agents have Combat Abilities that impact attack order, targeting, and damage.<br/><br/>"}, "161144": {"boardgamedesigner": {"10616": {"name": "Birgit H\u00e4hnle"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Biberburgen", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamefamily": {"14694": "Animals: Beavers"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2409": {"name": "Heros"}}, "boardgameversion": {"243725": "German first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "The Beavers have to build lodges and collect winter stores, but always have to expect flooding and interference by other beavers from the neighboring areas.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a pair of beavers and a set of trees in different colors.

But while vampires in novels, movies, and television each provide their own unique twist or spin on the vampire myth, creating innumerable different interpretations of what it means to be a vampire, for the Pathfinder roleplaying game, at least, there is only one kind of vampire, which fits some styles of vampirism well, and doesn&rsquo;t fit others at all. Even worse for vampire enthusiasts, the ability to actually play as one of these nocturnal lurkers is incredibly limited.<br/><br/>At least, that was the case until Necromancers of the Northwest changed all that with Liber Vampyr: Secrets of the Blood, a book devoted to making vampiric player characters not only possible, but fully supported. It made use of a new system, called cruomancy, which allowed characters to gain blood points by drinking blood, and to spend those blood points to power various abilities, gained from feats and class features. The book was built in a way that allowed players to pick and choose not just their vampiric powers and abilities, but even their weaknesses, encouraging players to build their own monster to match their vision of vampirism.<br/><br/>Scions of the Vampire: Blood, Shadow, and Smoke picks up where Liber Vampyr left off, by providing 50 new feats and three new prestige classes, as well as several groups of supplemental rules that cover some of the additional concerns of vampirism. The book introduces three vampiric lineages, or bloodlines, each with special powers. Gain power from darkness and make shadows do your bidding as a Shaedross scion, align yourself with the Borsiviaks in order to gain an eldritch mastery over blood, bending and twisting it at your whim, or delve deep into the power of the Montavix to transform into a misty vapor, rendering you all but immune to attack.

Players take on the roles of intrepid explorers traversing the globe in search of ancient artifacts while trying to outwit and outrun enemy agents.<br/><br/>The game begins with the players choosing a mythical artifact, which will serve as the McGuffin for the game. Each artifact will have a series of clues that are distributed around the world.<br/>Clues take several forms: They can be excavation sites, scraps of historical documents, ancient relics, or even people who may be able to help the players deduce the location of the artifact. Each clue that is collected brings the players on step closer to discovering the artifact&rsquo;s final resting place. Players will have to act fast as enemy agents (controlled by the game) will be hot on their heels collecting clues and setting ambushes at every turn!<br/><br/>Combat in EotE takes the form of action sequences, or confrontations with the enemy villain that happen periodically throughout the game. Players work together to defeat enemy minions by using their weapons, special abilities, teamwork, and most importantly, the environment around them. Furniture such as crates, explosive barrels, tables, and even bottles of whiskey can be used and manipulated by the players to give them the upper hand in any battle. Find yourself staring down the barrel of a Tommy Gun? Flip over the nearest table for cover! Cornered by a band of hired muscle? Grab the nearest whiskey bottle, set it alight, and toss it at an explosive crate to create the perfect getaway!<br/><br/>To the Ends of the Earth is the board game where you, the players, truly determine the course of your adventure! Fight vigilantly to defeat the enemy villain, recover the artifact, and win the game!<br/><br/>EotE features a unique Action Dice allocation system to determine the options available to each player during their turn. Each player will choose an adventurer to control for the duration of the game. Each adventurer has three &quot;stats&quot;, which determine their proficiency for different tasks:<br/><br/>Brawn determines a character&rsquo;s Strength, Speed, and Endurance, and is used for physical tasks such as brawling, climbing, or using melee weapons.<br/><br/>Skill describes a character&rsquo;s Dexterity, Coordination, and Awareness. Using firearms, disarming traps, and driving vehicles are made much easier with a high Skill Stat.<br/><br/>Wits relates to a character&rsquo;s Intelligence, Problem-Solving, and Inter-Personal skills. A high Wits Stat is needed to conduct research, excavate dig sites, or issue commands to allies and other characters.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each turn, a player will roll their available Action Dice (five six-sided dice if their character is healthy). Each die rolled below a Stat may be used for an action that requires that Stat.<br/><br/>Actions include movement, researching artifacts, brawling with enemies, using firearms, or manipulating the environment. Special abilities and equipment broaden the choices available to each player, and with so much potential to strategize, there is never a &lsquo;bad roll&rsquo;. Every action you take will have consequences that ripple through the rest of the game, creating a unique adventure each time you play!<br/><br/>"}, "161221": {"boardgamedesigner": {"76090": {"name": "Oliver Stuhr"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Das Feuerrote Teufelchen", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2676": "Grid Movement"}, "yearpublished": "1983", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"20759": "Spiel"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"402": {"name": "Edition Perlhuhn (G\u00f6ttinger Spiele)"}}, "boardgameversion": {"243842": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Das Feuerrote Teufelchen (The Fire-Red Devil) is an abstract chase designed for Spiel sets.<br/><br/>The &quot;devil&quot; player attempts to overtake the &quot;angel&quot; player, while the angel aims to keep moving until the cubes run out.

Each building has four characteristics &mdash; carpentry, masonry, architecture, painting &mdash; rated between 0 and 5, and the workers have the same characteristics valued in the same range. To complete a construction, the player must add enough workers to cover the four characteristics of the building, but placing a worker on a construction site costs money.<br/><br/>Each turn players have three free actions; however, for an added cost players may also chose to buy additional actions during their turn. Unlike in The Builders: Middle Ages, players can acquire slaves and put them to work, but if they don't pay to free the slaves by the end of the game, they lose points. Other changes from the original game include the ability to send your workers to universities or purchase tools to improve their characteristics.<br/><br/>Make use of your workers, of your slaves, or your freed slaves to build your buildings and amass victory points to ultimately be named the greatest builder of all!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"272364": "English first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "name": "The Builders: Antiquity", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "age": "10", "usersrated": "646", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "average": "6.89956"}, "161227": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2433190.jpg", "poll": {}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1998", "maxplayers": "0", "age": "0", "boardgamepublisher": {"1845": {"name": "Heartbreaker"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2433190_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>The Cathedrals of the Brotherhood stand as citadels of faith before the overwhelming tide of the Dark Legion.

The goal is to build your colony and complete the set of five achievements required by the game before the last turn ends and players can do this by cooperating or competing one with each other.<br/><br/>Players build new sectors, train new citizens and manage their command to do as many actions as they can to maximize production of credits, influence, equipment or overpower while also progressing. The game requires lots of planning since there are many things that can intervene and ruin your plan if not paying attention. Players interact and can either help or sabotage each other. Units can be sent to start fires, break structures, close doors, start an epidemic or even unpower structures. To resolve all these players need to assign command to their units and use them to repair, build or interact with different things from the colony. Players can improve their units by equipping them with items or assigning them influence thus enabling them access to the faction's unique super power.<br/><br/>If you like strategy games, games that can be played solo, games that have confrontation or simply that let you cooperate with a friend while facing a great challenge then M.I.N.D may be the perfect choice for you.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"243918": "First edition"}, "age": "8", "name": "MIND", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "average": "8.16667", "usersrated": "6", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "161278": {"boardgamedesigner": {"73213": {"name": "Stephen Stagliano"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Spiritual Warfare", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2664": "Deck / Pool Building"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2055872_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2456": {"name": "The Game Crafter, LLC"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2055872.png", "boardgameversion": {"243920": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1010": {"name": "Fantasy"}}, "age": "13", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Spiritual Warfare is everything you want in a game!

Green Orbs are used to by Action Cards, and a combination of all 5 colors gets you a Gate Key.<br/><br/>On a players turn, they may choose to do one of the following actions: 1) pulling Orb Cards 2) spend Orb Cards 3) Attack a player<br/><br/>You obtain Spirit Points by: Purchasing Angels and Demons, going through Gates using Gate Keys and White Orbs, buying Action Cards (some of them are just Spirit Points), or Battling other players!<br/><br/>In a battle, the attacking player uses their Demon Cards and the defending player uses their Angel Cards. Each player starts with 10 hit points. Players take turns rolling dice to try and damage the other player. 5's and 6's are hits wile 1-4 miss. Angel and Demon Cards consist of either Battle Cards that last for the entire battle (i.e. Armored Angel - You cannot be hit by 5's) or Attack Cards that are played before a player rolls the dice (i.e. Fire Demon - On your next roll, 6'd hit for 2 damage). The first player to bring their opponent to zero Hit Points wins.<br/><br/>Finally, the Character Cards in the game all give slight advantages and manipulate all of the mechanics listed above!<br/> Now...Bow your head, say your prayers, and prepare for Spiritual Warfare!<br/><br/>"}, "161279": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2062989.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"7710": {"name": "Arnaud Urbon"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"9019": "Olivier Fagn\u00e8re"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5400": {"name": "Matagot"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2062989_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "Promo expansion or Korrigans given away at the 5000 first visitors of &quot;Paris est Ludique&quot; in June 2014.<br/><br/>Place the Orange Korrigan in the village.

In this game you play the role of one of the crew members on board the space ship Liberty. Your job as a Mover is to jump from planet to planet in the system picking up and delivering cargo. Movers specialize in getting cargo to its destination as efficiently as possible. As you deliver cargo, you are rewarded with resources that are needed to keep the Liberty flying. But you must do this without drawing too much attention from the Universal Oversight.<br/><br/>Universal Oversight (UO) is the government elected by the planets to police the system. The UO watches all movement through the system in an attempt to keep order. Over time it has become corrupt and evil. UO Scouts are sometimes dispatched to chase down and interrogate Movers that have been spotted delivering cargo. They are looking to confiscate anything that might be a threat to the UO&rsquo;s power. If you draw the eye of the UO too often, your job will eventually become impossible. You and your fellow players must work together to deliver cargo, avoid UO Scouts and quickly handle any Events that pop up along the way.<br/><br/>To win the game, you need to complete a set of five Objective Cards. These cards directly continue the story that begins in the included graphic novel Finding Liberty. (A 20-card random objective card deck will also be included with the game. Players can choose 5 cards from this deck for a fresh experience each game)<br/><br/>- Unique Dice-Rolling Mechanic<br/>How the dice are rolled-Space Movers handles dice-rolling to complete skill checks in a whole new way. Rolls take place inside the game box on a specially designed roll board. Dice are rolled one at a time instead of all at once. For each skill needed in the check, 1 die will be rolled needing a 5 or higher for success. Since the dice are rolled 1 at a time into the box, players are encouraged to strike dice already rolled in an attempt to change the result as needed. After all the dice are rolled, one last roll is made using the blank 6 sided die. This signals the end of the skill check and is a player&rsquo;s last attempt to change any previous die results.<br/><br/>- Comic Book Included<br/>The story begins in the Comic book &ldquo;Finding Liberty&rdquo; that will be included with the game.

Born to her elven mother and raised among the fey folk, Aspasia had love and respect for the sylvan land. Her grandmother had lived in the Minnimar centuries before and Aspasia traveled here to reconnect with her ancestral home.  So it was for a great while, and she lived in peace. She spoke to the wild like no other, and traveled with a stag who bore a crown of horns.<br/><br/>But in time, men came and they built homes as men do, and for their homes they cut trees. And they feasted as men do, and for their feasts they hunted the wild game. Thus it was that Aspasia found the men one eve feasting upon the Stag and she cursed them and she called on the forest gods to bring them death and ruin.  And thus it was, for the wood&rsquo;s ancient powers rose to her druidic call, and her rage summoned ruin slew the men. But to her dismay the spirit remained, refusing her calls of banishment, so it was that the Minnimar became a cursed wood, for both fair and foul.<br/><br/>And the call goes out for stalwart adventurers, to bring relief from Minnimar&rsquo;s sufferance.<br/><br/>"}, "161459": {"rpg": {"17925": "13th Age"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Make Your Own Luck", "rpgproducer": {"13834": "Gareth Hanrahan"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2070762.jpg", "usersrated": "4", "rpgitemversion": {"244215": "First English Printing"}, "average": "7.25", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2622": "Quick Start / Fast Play Rules"}, "rpgseries": {"24895": "Free RPG Day 2014"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2070762_t.jpg", "description": "From back cover<br/><br/>This introduction to the game includes pre-generated characters, a quick summary of the rules, and a full adventure for a GM and 3-6 players.

Play consists of investing In various companies, and receiving from the &quot;INVESTO&quot; Bank, Dividends and Bonuses in accordance with Instructions on a number of cards drawn by the players in rotation. Companies become bankrupt by the drawing of one of the Bankrupt cards.<br/><br/>TO BEGIN. One of the players is selected as Banker, and issues each of the players with &pound;1,000 with which to make his or her investments; retaining the balance of the money as the &quot;INVESTO&quot; Bank. (The Banker is entitled to join in the game, and should also receive the initial &pound;1,000.) The cards are then shuffled and placed face downwards in the centre of the table. The cards representing the ten companies are shuffled separately and placed face downwards beside the Banker, who is at all times in charge of the game. A number of company cards are then turned face upwards, in front of the Banker; the number so faced being one less than the number of players. (e.g. If five people are playing, then four company cards are turned up.) Players now invest in one or more of the companies as desired. All investments must be in multiples of &pound;100. The Banker keeps a record of all investments.<br/> THE PLAY. The first player (determined by any method desired) then draws the top card and places it face up in front of him. Each card has a number of the top representing one of the companies. If the player drawing the card has invested in that company, he announces the dividend (e.g. No. 4 &mdash;30% or 6/- in the &pound;). The Banker thereupon pays ALL players who have invested in No. 4 company, 30% of their investment, from the money in the Bank. Should the player not have invested in the company whose card is drawn, the play passes to the person next on his left, and so on round the table; each player announcing the dividend or bonus to be paid.

The Anger Expansion does exactly the opposite - it's filled with a lot of sneaky moves, game-changing abilities and &quot;take that&quot; mechanics. It's a total blast to play, but it's not for the thin-skinned.<br/><br/>The 11 new abilities can be individually added to the WILD Coaster from the base game to spice things up. Or players may use the included Anger Management Disc and Anger Coaster combination to create a quick mix of new abilities to explore.<br/><br/>(A set of 4 Angry Dice, originally included with this package, is needed for one of the abilities.)<br/><br/>The Dice Hate Me Signature Series:<br/>The Dice Hate Me Signature Series is an elegant set of miniature games that can be added to the base game of VivaJava Dice and is fully compatible with the Anger Expansion. Five excellent Dice Hate Me Games titles are represented in the mix (Brew Crafters, Compounded, Belle of the Ball, Carnival, and The Great Heartland Hauling Co.) and each comes with an ability disc and Coaster combination that are added to the WILD Coaster from the base game.<br/><br/>While the Anger Expansion is focused on adding more player interaction and wilder ability combinations, The Dice Hate Me Signatures Series focuses again on expanding the game with meaningful and alternate ways to score points and move forward toward victory. Each of the Coasters takes thematic and mechanical cues from the represented games, and will be nostalgic to those familiar with the other Dice Hate Me titles.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"244253": "First Edition"}, "average": "7.13125", "name": "VivaJava: The Coffee Game: The Dice Game - Game of the Year Expansion", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "32", "expands": {"139899": {"name": "VivaJava: The Coffee Game: The Dice Game"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "161485": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Pro Evolution Soccer 2014", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"244255": "North American PlayStation 3 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2521657.jpg", "videogameseries": {"4910": "Pro Evolution Soccer"}, "videogametheme": {"2373": "Sports - Soccer"}, "usersrated": "2", "average": "8", "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4435": "PlayStation 3"}, "videogamehonor": {"31962": "2013 Game Critics Best Sports Game of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2521657_t.jpg", "description": "Pro Evolution Soccer 2014, officially abbreviated to PES 2014, also known in Japan and South Korea as World Soccer: Winning Eleven 2014 is an association football video game and the latest game in Pro Evolution Soccer series, developed and published by Konami.

The update version for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 was released on June 3, 2014, with the full retail versions to follow on August 5. The PC versions (both digital and retail) are set for release on August 8, the PC port being delayed to get the console versions ready in time for the 2014 Evolution Championship Series. The PC version of Ultra Street Fighter IV will be the first game in the series to use Steam from day one, following the discontinuation of Games for Windows - LIVE.<br/><br/>The update introduces six new stages, and five new characters: Rolento, Elena, Hugo and Poison (all four of whom had been featured in Street Fighter X Tekken), in addition to Decapre, a member of M. Bison's Dolls, who makes her first playable appearance in the series. It has been revealed that, despite some of the new characters having been recently featured in X Tekken, their gameplay mechanics are substantially different in order to match the game's pace. The game also adds a feature called &quot;Edition Select&quot; which, similarly to Hyper Street Fighter II, allows players to select different versions of characters, based on their properties in past Street Fighter IV iterations. Also, the update adds a &quot;Double Ultra&quot; option, which makes both of the character's Ultra Combos available simultaneously, at the cost of them doing reduced damage.<br/><br/>Alongside the usual balance changes, the update introduces some new fighting mechanics. The first is a new move called Red Focus, similar to the regular Focus move, but having more invincibility hits. Also new is a &quot;delayed wakeup&quot; technique, which allows a knocked-down player to slightly lengthen the time before the character gets back up.
