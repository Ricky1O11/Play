Cards can be played facing any direction. There are sixteen Journey cards and four Journey&rsquo;s End cards which, when played on one of the four journeys will immediately end that journey and score that stack of cards.<br/><br/>Gaido offers interesting play choices, with a strategy that&rsquo;s deeper than it first appears and a simple play style.

The Roman Legions left Britain a century before and the land is now divided into a dozen rival kingdoms. From over the sea the refugees of the shattered empire and the waves of westward migrations arrive in ever greater numbers. The old Gods are still dominant, but now there is a new God with ambitious and persuasive missionaries. The last gift of an ungrateful empire - Christianity.<br/><br/>Amongst this chaos a ruthless man tries to forge a single nation and fails. Uther, called the Pendragon, dies with unity within his grasp, betrayed by his own lust. The great druid Merllyn goes into hiding with the tyrant's infant son, and the cycle of civil wars continue.<br/><br/>Into this mix of war and politics this game introduces all the mythic elements of the time: Druid Magic, Christian Miracles, the Sidhe, the old Gods, and the magical nature of the land of Logres itself.<br/><br/>It is now that the Characters begin their careers during the upheavals in the mythic Britain of the 5th-6th Century.

At the end of this age was the War of the Ring, who&rsquo;s heroes and exploits are well-documented in Tolkien&rsquo;s epic  history &ndash; The Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>This game, however, is set before the end of the Third Age, when things were far less black and white. The evil of Sauron reborn had not yet come to full fruit and the world of men and elves was disunited and tottering upon the very brink of eternal darkness. In that time many heroes died unsung in the fight to reveal Sauron&rsquo;s byzantine plans, and the One Ring lay still in the hands of Gollum, deep in the Misty Mountains.<br/><br/>The players take on the roles of minor heroes on the side of the Light, struggling to defend the free peoples from an, as yet, nameless evil. They will interact with many of the people who later come to prominence at the end of the age, such as Gandalf, Radagast, Elrond, Thorin Oakenshield, Gwaihir, and a host of others. They will also find themselves in opposition to devious Goblin Kings, savage Trolls, ferocious Warg pack leaders, sinister Wights, the Nine and a horde of their minions. They may even hazard facing the Necromancer at Dol Guldur once they are of sufficient power.<br/><br/>from The Rules:<br/>These are based partly upon Chaosium&rsquo;s Runequest 2. Although this gives some of the underlying mechanics of the game, I think that you will find that many of the anomalies of those rules have been addressed without adding to their complexity, and that the feel of Tolkien&rsquo;s work permeates every corner.

It's described by the designer as &quot;super-charged Monopoly,&quot; but it's most similar to Mario Party without the mini-games. The game board is printed on map paper, which allows it to fit inside the small box. After unfolding the board, the colorful box top becomes the &quot;centerpiece&quot; of the game board. Players take turns rolling two dice off of the box top; at least one die must end up on the game board itself, and neither can roll farther than the board's border, or the roll is invalid. They then move the sum of their roll. Every space has special effect that triggers either when landed on or when leaving the space. The goal of the game is to collect feathers, represented by paper money, in order to buy puzzle pieces. Puzzle pieces can be purchased when the player lands on two of the corner spaces, and passing the Start Together space generates an income of 25 feathers. Feathers can also be gained and lost in various ways.<br/><br/>Aside from rolling off the box top, the main distinguishing feature of the game is that each player's pawn is represented by a pair of stacked poker chips. When landing on the Banana Split garden space, the poker chips are split up, and are subsequently treated as separate pawns. If they ever occupy the same space, other than the Banana Split space, they are recombined. Split pieces give more options when moving, and some spaces reward the player for having their chips either combined or separated.<br/><br/>As in Monopoly, rolling doubles allows the player to move again, and rolling snake eyes sends the other player's chips to the Bird Cage (identical to Monopoly's Jail space).<br/><br/>Description from Kickstarter:<br/><br/>Super-charged Monopoly. Dice fall off box, the game travels in. White and black poker-chips get pulled apart and put together.<br/><br/>To play simply learn to drop the dice off the box, and keep them on the game-board.   The very first corner space states, Divide Your Game Parts.  What made that work, are five No/Rest circles added to select spaces.  They take away the choice, of which game-piece to move.  Before I adding those circles, catch-22's would happen.   A different space states, Exchange Your Bank of Feathers.  It allows a player to come from behind at anytime.<br/><br/>The inside of the box works great as a game-bank.   Each time around the board Eagle, Duck and Seagull feathers are rewarded.   The goal of CENTERPIECE, becomes a RACE to purchase nine-puzzle-spaces one at a time.  Have a bank of two-hundred feathers, have game-parts together.  Then land on the Start Sun space, or Bidgecage space to WIN.  Players keep score, with black and white pawns, under the box, at the games center.   Who's best at finding the best price for a numbered puzzle-space, while staying out of the Birdcage corner space.

Although the game is free to download, players may purchase in-game currency called Platinum.<br/><br/>Players control members of the Tenno, ancient warriors who have awoken from centuries of cryosleep to find themselves at war with the Grineer, a race of militarized humanoid clones; the Corpus, a mega-corporation with advanced robotics and laser technology; and the Infested, disfigured victims of the Technocyte virus. To fight back, the Tenno use advanced exo-armor with unique abilities&mdash;the titular Warframes.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>In Warframe, up to four players work together to complete missions, such as eliminating enemies, retrieving data from terminals, assassinating high ranking/dangerous targets, defending an artifact, or surviving as long as possible. Players wear a battlesuit called a Warframe, each with its own set of abilities and statistics; and are equipped with three weapons&mdash;a primary weapon (such as a rifle, bow, or shotgun), a secondary weapon (typically a pistol), and a melee weapon (such as swords, axes, and hammers). Players earn Affinity (experience points) for killing enemies and completing challenges and missions, which allows them to level up their weapons and armor. Warframes and weaponry have access to modifications, or &quot;mods&quot;, that can be installed, removed and upgraded before and after missions; the higher the Affinity rank of any one piece of equipment, the more mods it can accommodate.<br/><br/>The camera is positioned over the shoulder for third-person shooting. The player can jump, sprint, slide, and roll, as well as combine techniques to quickly move throughout the level and avoid enemy fire. The game also allows players to utilize parkour techniques to evade enemies, bypass obstacles or gain access to secret areas. Maps are generated procedurally; with prebuilt rooms connected together so that no levels have the same layout. At times, the enemy faction can initiate a lockdown of the area, forcing players to hack security terminals by completing a puzzle minigame within a small time limit.<br/><br/>Credits, ammo, resources, and mods can be found in set locations, such as lockers and destructible containers, as well as dropped by enemies. New weapons, Warframes, and equipment can be purchased in the market (either the items themselves or their blueprints), using either Credits earned in-game, or Platinum purchased via microtransaction.[3] Blueprints can be constructed using resources found during gameplay.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Warframe,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "149085": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1854611.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Richard Garfield", "Lukas Litzsinger"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Henning Ludvigsen", "Matt Zeilinger"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Edge Entertainment", "Fantasy Flight Games", "Galakta", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1854611_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Science Fiction"], "description": "&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to anticipate every move.

Closing up with the anti-tank ditch, it began to encounter heavy opposition from not only the ditch, but positions directly behind it.

The storm unicorn (CR 8) is a mix of a unicorn and a pegasus, and possesses the ability to fly, as well as an affinity for storms and lightning, which it can fire from its jagged metallic horn. These elusive creatures are rare and exotic game, and are not noble paragons of virtue like their more common cousins. Finally, there is the purifier unicorn (CR 10), which is so pure and divine that non-good creatures that look upon it are struck blind.

Once, in the Ages Lost, our kind were revered as the penultimate conduits of knowledge and peace. How many soldiers must perish? How many of our heroes should fall? No matter; send the Necromancer! Heroes of ancient past, armies of deceased neighbors - all in splendid regalia - may return to the battlefield to crush our enemies when the pitiable healers and abjurers could not save them or us. Even those laughable diviners thinking the mind and eye were the foundation of perception failed to see what the ghost knew or the corpse saw. Indeed, the mighty Necromancer was once the champion of Empires. Then, morality stagnated. The pious followers of Galayne or Bethune came to ensure that life was life and death was death. Even the more pathetic followers of Whistus could not see that their Pale Maiden was a gateway which could be crossed in either direction.<br/><br/>Nay, we are Necromancers and we KNOW what the others refuse to see. Perhaps the best spy is the skeleton all nobles hide in their closets; perhaps the best soldier is the one who already gave his life. Yet, despite our displays of power we are reviled by the king, the holy-man and the scholar alike. We are painted into the corner of depraved lunatic with suspicion of grave-robbing, murder, desecration, blasphemy and heresy. We need not murder or grave-rob to acquire our minions when the foolish and tyrannical will send us materials by the wagonload. We need not temples or dieties to offend when we ourselves approach godhead. This is our greatness and this is our heresy: through Necromancy, we gain deification.<br/><br/>So, dear reader, I may be long dead from some paladin's blade. I may be re-awakened by a compatriot only be to eradicated by some priest's chanting. But, I am not gone. I still stir, as bone or spirit, as we all should. For what power should I hail when life and death are meaningless? Of course MY OWN, when I am the one who has made it so. And YOUR power as well, if you be brave enough to use this simple book to demolish the chains preventing your ascension.

Instead, Rils has been portrayed as devoted to the study of necromancy and the undead as a matter of intellectual curiosity.<br/><br/>The scholars who accept that Rils existed believe that because of his devotion to knowledge, he created numerous repositories holding his scrolls and books.  They also claim that Rils did not wish his knowledge to fall into unworthy hands or to be acquired too easily. As such, these repositories are supposed to be well guarded and thoroughly trapped.<br/><br/>Rils&rsquo; actual fate (assuming he existed at all) is not recorded in history. Some scholars believe that he was destroyed by adventurers who mistook him for an evil lich. Others contend he was destroyed by adventurers because he was an evil lich.

Despite this defeat, the gods dispensed rewards to the heroes of the war. The cat heroes were granted a gift of magical golden cows that provided an endless supply of delicious milk that could be claimed by any righteous cat.<br/><br/>Over the centuries, cows were lost to chance, murder, or negligence until but one remained. The last golden cow was taken to the greatest Temple of the Cats. Tragically, the priests eventually succumbed to greed and kept all the milk to themselves. Because of this selfishness, the gods cursed the priests with endless thirst (and gigantic hairballs) and took the cow from them. However, they ruled that if a cat were cunning enough to learn the location of the golden cow, brave enough to recover it and generous enough to share the milk, then the magic milk would flow again for all cats. To ensure that the cats would have a tough time of it, the gods turned over the creation of the dungeon to Yote, a god of trickery. Unfortunately, he allowed his nephew Scradoo to help design the dungeon. After it was completed, the dungeon was given appropriate canine and milk based guardians.<br/><br/>Since that time many a cunning cat has set out on the search for the golden cow.

Each vehicle has a number of design options regarding which weapons are selected, engine size and various offensive and defensive accoutrements such as extra armour, targeting devises, smoke dischargers etc. This means that players can create very different vehicles from the same chassis. <br/>With the infantry we have divided them into a number of categories such as Light Infantry, Assault Infantry, Warriors and Heavy Weapons. Each category has a defined profile, a set of stats, weapons and armour that help it conform to their definition. This means that each type of squad has a particular function on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Light troops for instance move fast across the battlefield are good at scouting out the enemies dispositions and also getting out of trouble fast. Assault troops are designed to get in close with the enemy - they have the armour and firepower to take the fight to their opponents. The Warriors role is obviously to make contact with the enemy and destroy them in deadly hand-to-hand fighting. And Heavy Weapons teams are designed to hang back a bit and support forward units with heavy long-range fire.<br/><br/>Players will therefore need to learn how to use their troops to their best advantage as well as how to combine them with other squads in their force for maximum efficiency and effect. For instance, using light troops to identify targets, using heavy weapons to weaken and suppress the target and then sending in the warriors to finish them off at close quarters. Sounds easy? Not so in practise! What this simply means that it is not just a case of the dude with the biggest gun winning the day (although the game does have plenty of big guns!). The right troops have to be used at the right time in the right way.<br/><br/>The game also includes a number of leader types. These are heroes with certain special skills that will boost the performance of the force. Some of these figures might be just great individual fighters, others may have leadership skills that can enhance the power of the rest of the force.<br/><br/>What is very apparent to players is the amount of choice that they have in creating their force, from vehicle design to infantry squad selection and leader choice. A different army can be assembled for every game. <br/>Most battles will be fought over very challenging terrain. All manner of risks and rewards can be found - from hidden obstacles, explosive and flammable materials but also extra ammunition and weapons. The terrain always plays its part in games of Sulphur.<br/><br/>Another vital component to the game is the use of Asset Cards. These are played and collected during the game to further enhance the performance of a force. Each card is specific to a certain troop type (for example light squad, leader, vehicle etc). Each card will award the player a special skill or piece of equipment that will benefit that squad (and hopefully encourage the player to use the squad to its maximum advantage). These Asset Cards can have great significance in the game and add to the players burden of command and decision making - but they are a lot of fun too, especially when they thwart the plans of your opponent.<br/><br/>And from time to time there are the deadly and unpredictable incursions of Sulphur. The deadly field of  battle is made even more challenging by this unholy threat. Will the combatants form a temporary truce and turn their guns on this new and devastating threat or will they abandon their opponents, withdraw from the field and let them face the terror alone? The menace of Sulphur hangs over every battlefield like a cloud. Most times it does not appear - but the fear and unease that it generates is ever present&hellip;<br/><br/>"}, "149109": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1843759.jpg", "poll": [], "statistics": [], "boardgamecompilation": ["Crabs Adjust Humidity: Omniclaw Edition (unofficial expansion for Cards Against Humanity)"], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "20", "boardgamepublisher": ["Vampire Squid Cards"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1843759_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Fan Expansion", "Humor", "Mature / Adult", "Party Game"], "description": "Love Cards Against Humanity, but even with the official expansions do you find yourself playing the same cards over and over again?<br/><br/>Enter Crabs Adjust Humidity: Volume Two, a crappy little third-party, unofficial, unauthorized expansion card set &mdash; featuring 80 white cards and 32 black cards &mdash; that blends seamlessly with the original game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "4", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "6.65963", "name": "Crabs Adjust Humidity: Volume Two (unofficial expansion for Cards Against Humanity)", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "age": "17", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "109", "boardgameaccessory": ["Crabs Adjust Humidity: Blank Deck"], "boardgamefamily": ["Cards Against Humanity"]}, "149110": {"rpgartist": ["Peter Bradley", "Jason Walton"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Softcover Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Beneath the Dome", "rpgdesigner": ["James M.

But the answer goes back to February,1814, where - at the Battle of Vauchamps &ndash; then-Cavalry-General Grouchy showed he could be extremely good at chasing Bl&uuml;cher.<br/><br/>Vauchamps is one of those interesting battles mostly lost in the blur of &ldquo;the 1814 Campaign,&rdquo; where Napoleon kept giving bloody noses to the advancing allied armies but never quite had the strength for a decisive victory. Few Allied noses were as far out in front as that of Marshal Bl&uuml;cher. There, in a small chapter called the &ldquo;Six Days Campaign,&rdquo; Napoleon dealt the &ldquo;Army of Silesia&rdquo; defeat after defeat. Reeling from this, Bl&uuml;cher tried to disengage from Napoleon&rsquo;s personal attention and attack an isolated corps under Marmont, with a mostly infantry force that included the names Zeiten, Pirch, and Kleist that we would see in 1815.)<br/><br/>But &ldquo;Boney&rdquo; anticipated that move and turned the tables on Bl&uuml;cher&rsquo;s Prussians and Russians, who were advancing with little cavalry. For one time in 1814, Napoleon had more horses engaged and used them well.<br/><br/>The Battle of Vauchamps can be seen in three phases...Bl&uuml;cher advancing while Marmont falls back toward reinforcement, Marmont&rsquo;s counterattack, and Bl&uuml;cher&rsquo;s shock at discovering &ldquo;the Ogre&rdquo; again confronting him and falling back. Phase 3 is a long pursuit action - French cavalry hounding Allied squares (and breaking several!) Had the ground been less muddy (allowing the French horse artillery to stay closer), things would have been even worse for the Allies. As it was, in the final count, Allied losses may have been greater than 10-1 over the French, and Bl&uuml;cher (once again) was very nearly captured.<br/>[publisher's description]<br/><br/>La Bataille de Vauchamps is the 2013 ATO Annual.

In the game's history, around the seventh or eighth centuries a small number of humans took on bestial traits. The majority of humans feared these half-breeds and war broke out. Despite the humans outnumbering the half-breeds, their animal strength gave them the upper hand in centuries of conflict.<br/><br/>Centuries earlier, humanity finds new hope in King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. King Arthur and his like-minded knights take the fight to the half breeds, but Arthur soon realizes it's a losing battle. Through a mysterious turn of fate, the Knights discover Blackwater, a mystical liquid that significantly extends their lifetimes and gives them remarkable healing abilities. Despite this new advantage, the half-breeds continue to win battle after battle, until the Industrial Revolution turns the tide. Engineers are far ahead of their time, inventing technologies such as thermal imaging, Zeppelins, and wireless communications. New weapons belch electricity, ignite clouds of molten metal on top of enemies, and fulfill dual functions as fragmentation grenades and proximity mines.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The Order: 1886,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "149150": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Bryan King"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "P.O.N.E.  \"Protectors of Neo Earth\"", "playingtime": "2", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Area Movement", "Deck / Pool Building", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement"], "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Bryan King"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "2", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Dice", "Fantasy", "Medieval", "Territory Building"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "2", "description": "Neo Realms Entertainment is proud to announce the release of P.O.N.E.<br/><br/>Protectors of Neo-Earth or P.O.N.E. is a tactical board game with deck building properties.

It is set in a backstreet pub playing host to a boxing ring. The theme is around training your boxer, earning jewels on your belt, defeating opponents in the ring, and aiming to win the Pub Championship. You train by completing tasks such as the jump rope, the speed bag and the heavy bag. When having reached a high-enough life level from training, the Heavy Bag rotates to reveal the head of your opponent. Defeating the opponent is achieved by hitting him in the body, or by launching off ramps to hit him in the head until his life is reduced to zero. Other hits can be achieved by scoring combos off the various ramps.<br/><br/>Whirlwind was released in 1990 by Williams and is themed around storm-chasers. The original table included a fan which blowed in the player's face when the storm starts picking up. The playfield includes three rotating discs, which can throw the ball in unexpected directions, and six jet bumpers, which also add a high degree of randomness - perfectly complementing the theme of the table. The primary aim of the game is to activate Feel The Power Multiball by locking two balls. In order to activate the locks, various storm and navigation themed activities need to be completed.<br/><br/>"}, "149171": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Freelance Traveller (Issue 46 - Oct 2013)", "rpgdesigner": ["Ken Bearden", "Michael Brown (I)", "Timothy Collinson", "kafka", "Ken Murphy", "Ken Pick", "Rob Prior", "Ewan Quibell", "Michael Wakefield", "Dwayne Walstrom", "Jeff Zeitlin"], "rpgproducer": ["Jeff Zeitlin"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1800525.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "rpgissue": ["Freelance Traveller"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Active Measures: The Bellona Intrigue", "Active Measures: The Color of Monks' Robes", "Confessions of a Newbie Referee", "Critics' Corner", "Critics' Corner", "Critics' Corner", "Critics' Corner", "Doing It My Way: A System for Character Improvement", "Doing It My Way: The Ship\u2019s Locker: Limiting Without Specifying", "From the Editor", "In A Store Near You: Cargo Lifter", "In A Store Near You: Holmes-class Air/Raft", "In A Store Near You: Luderitz-class Undersea Mining Trawler", "Kurishdam: Beam Dancing", "Kurishdam: Jump Destination: Tanna-Sheru, Alkaidin System", "News About Traveller", "Raconteurs\u0092\u2019 Rest: Drop Out, Part Twenty Five", "Up Close and Personal: Shuchithra"], "rpg": ["Traveller (Classic)", "Traveller (Mongoose)", "Traveller: The New Era"], "rpgpublisher": ["Freelance Traveller"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF Version - European A4", "PDF Version - US Letter"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1800525_t.jpg", "description": "From the Contents page:<br/><br/>Freelance Traveller #046: October 2013<br/><br/>Cover: NASA<br/><br/>Freelance Traveller is published monthly in PDF form by the editor.

Let&rsquo;s break that down so you can see what you&rsquo;re getting yourself into.<br/><br/>P&amp;P is a tabletop roleplaying game. We&rsquo;re going to assume you&rsquo;ve got this one covered.<br/><br/>P&amp;P is a narration-driven system. The rules in this game are not effects driven. For the most part, they don&rsquo;t tell you what happens. Instead, they tell you who gets to describe what happens. And that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about in P&amp;P: describing what happens. Both the players and the gamemaster (GM) take turns narrating events in the game world. This makes P&amp;P feel more like an exercise in collaborative storytelling than a typical roleplaying game. However, P&amp;P isn&rsquo;t totally freeform and open-ended either. There are rules that help determine what characters can do and how they compare to one another, especially in combat! This prevents the game from devolving into a never-ending debate about what is and isn&rsquo;t reasonable.<br/><br/>P&amp;P is rules light. It&rsquo;s chock full of gross oversimplifications and blatant inaccuracies that mimic comic book tropes rather than real-world facts. This also makes P&amp;P a simple game with a streamlined set of rules. Once you know what you&rsquo;re doing, you should be able to play without ever opening the book.<br/><br/>Finally, P&amp;P is designed to emulate four-color superhero comics. This game is about the heroic things the characters do and the heroic burdens they shoulder. Mundane matters get little attention. There aren&rsquo;t any detailed rules for dealing with money and wealth, but there most definitely is a rule for smashing into a bank vault. Let&rsquo;s be perfectly clear: This is not a deep and cerebral game. P&amp;P was designed to let you play stories about super heroes who save the world and beat the snot out of villains who richly deserve it. Like so much of the genre, P&amp;P is a gleefully unapologetic exercise in heroic wish fulfillment.<br/><br/><br/>Core Rules!<br/><br/>The core rules are finally here!<br/><br/>Included here are 2 versions of the game, one in full beautiful color and one with crisp, black-and-white line art so that your printer won't break up with you for printing it out. Both are 142 pages long and include:<br/><br/>Chapter 1: Introduction:  Um ... it's an introduction.  What did you expect?<br/><br/>Chapter 2: Action: This chapter include most of the rules you need to play the game, including rules for narrative task resolution and comic book slugfests!<br/><br/>Chapter 3: Characters: Here is where you learn how to make heroes!  We have full character creation rules that allow you to create street level prowlers, cosmic paragons, and everything in between.<br/><br/>Chapter 4: Heroism: This chapter explains the use of Resolve and Adversity, the narrative currency that players and gamemasters use to bend the rules of the game and even the game world itself in their favor.<br/><br/>Chapter 5: Wonderful Toys: You like gear?  Then this is the chapter for you.  This chapter includes weapons, armor, miscellaneous equipment, vehicles (and yes, vehicle combat rules), and even rules for creating your own makeshift items on the fly in the middle of a story.  What could possibly go wrong?<br/><br/>Chapter 6: Big Bad World: It's a big world full of bad stuff that give heroes headaches.  Disasters, Diseases, Hazards ... ther're all in here.<br/><br/>Chapter 7: Friends &amp; Foes: A veritable rogues gallery at your disposal. A host of mundane (and not so mundane) npcs, from Athletes to Zombies, a large number of animals from Bats to Zebras (yes, of course there are dinosaurs in there), and a collection of archetypal supers from the Acrobat to the Weather Controller that you can used as villains, or even as heroes if you're in a rush.<br/><br/>Chapter 8: Playing the Game: This chapter provides both players and gamemasters (but mostly gamemasters) with tools, tips, and tricks for running the best super hero roleplaying game they can run.  We give you our thoughts about playing and running roleplaying games while desperately trying not to sound patronizing.<br/><br/>Chapter 9: From the Ashes: A light-hearted (and rather forgiving) introductory adventurefor a group of heroes of standard power level.<br/><br/><br/>The world needs heroes.<br/><br/><br/>Take a Stand!

But while vampires in novels, movies, and television each provide their own unique twist or spin on the vampire myth, creating innumerable different interpretations of what it means to be a vampire, for the Pathfinder roleplaying game, at least, there is only one kind of vampire, which fits some styles of vampirism well, and doesn&rsquo;t fit others at all. Even worse for vampire enthusiasts, the ability to actually play as one of these nocturnal lurkers is incredibly limited.<br/><br/>In March of 2010, the original Liber Vampyr: Secrets of the Blood attempted to address these issues by creating a new kind of vampire for the Pathfinder roleplaying game: the revenant. Designed to be a player character race and intended to have access to a wide array of different vampiric &ldquo;blood powers,&rdquo; Liber Vampyr invited players to build their own vampire, based on whatever interpretation of vampires they preferred, and was fully designed with vampire player characters in mind, allowing them to progress through their vampiric power the same way that a sorcerer progresses through arcane magic.<br/><br/>To date, over 150,000 copies of the original Liber Vampyr have been downloaded. But despite its popularity, we felt that we could make it better. The new version of Liber Vampyr has been redesigned from the ground up to be more intuitive and easy to use, as well as to improve player experience. Virtually every part of the book has been rewritten in order to affect this change, and the result is an entirely new monster that can still provide fun and excitement campaign after campaign.<br/><br/>"}, "149201": {"rpgartist": ["Jeff Preston"], "rpg": ["Labyrinth Lord"], "statistics": [], "name": "Explorer", "rpgdesigner": ["James Spahn"], "rpgproducer": ["James Spahn"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1800927.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Barrel Rider Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1800927_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>An expert on the occult, and how does one say it&hellip; obtainer of rare antiquities.<br/><br/>The Explorer, a full 20-level class for Labyrinth Lord (and other old-school fantasy role-playing games) is ready to brave whatever mysteries the dungeons of the world may offer!

In Huey Leader, fly search and destroy missions to attack enemy troops, fly missions to deploy US ground troops into hostile Landing Zones and then provide Close Air Support to help the troops complete their mission, and even fly resupply missions to keep US Forward Bases supplied.<br/><br/>Huey Leader is based on our popular Thunderbolt-Apache Leader game system. If you've played TAL, you'll be up and flying missions against the Vietcong in minutes.<br/><br/>The game places you in command of the pilots and aircraft of a squadron of U.S. Close Air Support (CAS) aircraft.<br/><br/>A major part of the game is mission planning. You decide how to arm your aircraft and which pilots are best for the mission. Pilots are rated for skill level. Deciding which pilots to fly each mission is a major consideration. Your pilots will become fatigued with every mission. If you fly a pilot too often, his skills will degrade. Your pilots also gain experience with every mission flown. This makes for some great decision-making. Should you keep flying the top pilots and further fatigue them to get the job done, or fly the new guys to prep them for the tough missions ahead?<br/><br/>Missions are quickly resolved using an area movement system to display tactical combat over the target. Speed and realism take top priority in this game. Terrain cards randomly generate each battlefield. The cards include mountain ranges that block lines of sight from both you and the enemy forces. If you plan it right, you get to fly nap of the earth through the canyons and come screaming over the ridgeline to rain fire down on the enemy before they can react. Beware! During each battle enemy air defenses will pop-up on the map to ruin your day, so watch were you&rsquo;re flying!<br/><br/>You get to resolve every shot taken at you by enemy AAA, and every air to ground attack you make against the enemy targets. Each enemy tank, APC, Infantry Squad, Machinegun Nest, etc is represented by its own counter on the battlefield.<br/><br/>While performing each mission, you get to decide how your pilots engage the enemy Vehicles, Troops, and AAA Sites. This makes for some tough choices. Do you hit the high value targets first, or take out the enemy AAA assets first?<br/><br/>Your aircraft are usually able to survive more than one attack. These aircraft are rugged and made to soak-up damage. This also factors into your decision-making. How long should you loiter over the target blowing-up enemy targets before heading for home? If your aircraft is too shot-up, it may not be able to fly for days.<br/><br/>Huey Leader features an operation combat sheet that tracks the progress of enemy formations attempting to overrun your sector. You get to select the formation you want to engage each day and assign the air assets you think are best suited to the task.<br/><br/>We&rsquo;ve included the cards for every pilot to progress in experience from Newbie, to Green, Average, Skilled, Veteran, and Ace!<br/><br/>Key Design Features: <br/>An all-around excellent solitaire game. <br/>Manage your pilots as well as your hardware to be a successful squadron commander. <br/>Intuitive, fast-playing game system.<br/><br/>Huey Leader includes the following aircraft:<br/>UH-1 Iroquois<br/>CH-47 Chinook<br/>AH-1 Cobra<br/>OH-6 Cayuse<br/>A-1 Skyraider<br/>AC-47 Spooky<br/><br/>Component List:<br/>165 Full Color Cards<br/>2 Full Color Counter Sheets (352 counters)<br/>3 Full Color Counter Sheets with Terrain Hexes (18 counters)<br/>22&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; Full Color Tactical Sheet<br/>1 Full Color Air Base Sheet<br/>1 Full Color Player Log Sheet<br/><br/>Scheduled Campaign List:<br/>Westmoreland's War 1/1965<br/>Operation Hump 10/1965<br/>Khe Sanh 1/1968<br/>Tet Offensive 1/1968<br/>Easter Offensive 3/1972<br/>And more!<br/><br/>Target Audience: <br/>This game is perfect for both expert level military gamers as well as first time gamers. The core rules are easy to grasp and very intuitive, while still giving players a wide variety of decision-making options and tactical choices.<br/><br/>Each mission requires only in 30 to 60 minutes.<br/><br/>Each campaign consists of 2 to 10 Days in which you&rsquo;ll fly one or more missions each Day.<br/><br/>"}, "149245": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1802649.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Rustan H\u00e5kansson", "Nina H\u00e5kansson", "Einar Ros\u00e9n", "Robert Ros\u00e9n"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgameartist": ["Frida L\u00f6gdberg"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Lautapelit.fi", "REBEL.pl"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1802649_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game"], "description": "Promotional card for the game Nations.

Thus, these modular miniatures allow players to do bookkeeping and track game events directly on the battlefield instead of using paper. The moving parts are magnetic and can be swapped in and out to allow players to customize their forces.<br/><br/>To allow the moving parts to take the stress and friction of repeated movement, Ironburst miniatures are cast in a special zinc alloy called ZAMAK, which is not as soft as tin (and much lighter), nor as fragile as resin, while keeping a good amount of detail.<br/><br/>"}, "149284": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder Roleplaying Game"], "poll": [], "name": "Mummy's Mask", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "usersrated": "1", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2465542.jpg", "rpgitemversion": ["Physical accessory"], "rpgsetting": ["Golarion"], "average": "5", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Paizo Publishing"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["Mummy's Mask", "Pathfinder Cards"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2465542_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>Give life to your NPCs with Mummy's Mask Face Cards!

I shelled out ten bucks and had no idea exactly what I had bought. I knew it was a game, I knew it looked cool, but I had never played a role-playing game before and wasn&rsquo;t entirely certain what to expect.<br/><br/>I opened the box when I got home and found two plastic odd- shaped dice, a white crayon (to fill in the engraved numbers on the plastic dice then wipe off the excess), a couple of books (one called &ldquo;Basic&rdquo; and one called &ldquo;Expanded&rdquo; rules), and a bunch of tactical maps and punch-out chits.<br/><br/>My first game was a lot of fun, though I did just about everything wrong that I think is possible. The character&rsquo;s stats were all inflated, I kept increasing IM with each roll, adding over and over... You name it I did it wrong. But it was an amazing experience.<br/><br/>After a few years, I had a lot of experience with role-playing. Friends got me into playing D&amp;D and some others, and I learned the value of good story-telling.<br/><br/>During all this time, I kept playing Star Frontiers. My human military specialist turned spy became very tough, able to handle just about any situation. He had enemies and friends all over the frontier, had an island on a remote world with a private military base and a small army to defend it. I played other characters, but Gavin Rove was always my favorite.<br/><br/>The most amazing thing about all this... I never purchased another supplement. I played and played, never running out of ideas, imagination, adventures, enemies, and fun. One box is all I needed. Games just don&rsquo;t sell that way anymore. Any company that did that would be shooting itself in the foot financially.<br/><br/>So that is why I have assembled all these rules here. You won&rsquo;t find too much modification to the original, I tried to keep it all true.

All the while, players engage in diplomatic intrigue with other races and will likely be drawn into (or start) wars of both survival and expansion.<br/><br/>The gameplay of Galactic Civilizations has evolved over the years, but we at Stardock have always prided ourselves on making conquest only one of several entertaining routes to victory. In Galactic Civilizations II, for example, players can wage multi-decade cold wars for the hearts and minds of neutral planets &ndash; or even expand their culture&rsquo;s reach to the point that each others&rsquo; colonies are the soft-power battleground. Players can conquer the galaxy without ever firing a shot through a combination of shrewd diplomacy and ever-expanding cultural influence.<br/><br/>Another popular feature of Galactic Civilizations II is the ability to design amazing ships and watch them battle other fleets. Ship design isn&rsquo;t just cosmetic, nor is it just a matter of putting the most powerful weapons and defenses on a given vessel. Victory often goes to the player who looks carefully at the types of weapons and defenses their opponents are deploying and designs ships to counter them.<br/><br/>And finally, strong computer AI has always been a major focus for Galactic Civilizations. The original Galactic Civilizations (for OS/2) was the world&rsquo;s first commercial 32-bit multithreaded computer game. That meant it could multitask within itself which allowed the computer players to &ldquo;think&rdquo; while the player was taking his/her turn.

Well, that&rsquo;s not entirely true.<br/><br/>The new races are a cool new addition to an already great game. The new frontier detail was incredibly valuable. The new gear was really cool after tiring of the old handful of things to be found in the frontier. The skill system in the old Star Frontiers game is built around solid frameworks that didn&rsquo;t allow certain character concepts (&ldquo;I want to be a stealthy assassin type, but don&rsquo;t give a hoot about analyzing mineral samples!&rdquo;), so the different skill list seemed like an interesting idea.<br/><br/>But we didn&rsquo;t like the modified game mechanic. It was good, as it stood, but not for our sacred Star Frontiers. We liked the way things worked already. We had house-ruled a few things, and made decisions about how to handle this or that. For us to do all that over again didn&rsquo;t wound like a very fun idea.<br/><br/>Additionally, the new options, if implemented, made all the other existing published data no longer compatible. For example, what about the character statistics found in all supplements and adventure modules? What skills to THEY have?<br/><br/>So that is why I didn&rsquo;t convert the original book to these rules and stick with them throughout. Since I liked the old rules, I figured everyone did. I was wrong.<br/><br/>It turns out that as I distributed this file to friends and they distributed it to theirs... people started asking for Zebulon&rsquo;s Guide to the Frontier. Who am I to argue with the masses? I&rsquo;ve seen Frankenstein too many times to ever want to anger a mob.<br/><br/>So here it is, in its original glory, reformatted and organized to make it more like today&rsquo;s role-playing games. As I worked on this, I found that the new game mechanics are actually very sound. I like them. Use them if you&rsquo;d prefer these, but just like the original Star Frontiers, I&rsquo;ll only make rules and supplements for public consumption that rely on the original Star Frontiers game.<br/><br/>"}, "149353": {"rpgdesigner": ["Bill Logan"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Star Frontiers: Alpha Dawn Quick-Reference Booklet", "rpgartist": ["Bill Logan"], "rpgproducer": ["Bill Logan"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1803247.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Space Opera)"], "rpgpublisher": ["DwD Studios"], "rpg": ["Star Frontiers"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["(Apocryphal Editions)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1803247_t.png", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>This Booklet contains all relevant tables and charts to keep you from having to access the game book too often during game-play.<br/><br/>"}, "149354": {"rpgdesigner": ["Bill Logan"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Knight Hawks Quick-Reference Booklet", "rpgartist": ["Bill Logan"], "rpgproducer": ["Bill Logan"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1803245.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Space Opera)"], "rpgpublisher": ["DwD Studios"], "rpg": ["Star Frontiers"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["(Apocryphal Editions)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1803245_t.png", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>This Booklet contains all relevant tables and charts to keep you from having to access the game book too often during game-play.<br/><br/>"}, "149355": {"rpgdesigner": ["Bill Logan"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Zebulon's Quick Reference Booklet", "rpgartist": ["Bill Logan"], "rpgproducer": ["Bill Logan"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1803244.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Space Opera)"], "rpgpublisher": ["DwD Studios"], "rpg": ["Star Frontiers"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["(Apocryphal Editions)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1803244_t.png", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>This Booklet contains all relevant tables and charts to keep you from having to access the game book too often during game-play.<br/><br/>"}, "149356": {"rpgdesigner": ["D.

The player controls the leadership of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and, peripherally, the German Central Staff who assumes greater and greater control over their ally. The Austro-Hungarians have unique challenges as they try to survive the onslaught of the &ldquo;Russian Steamroller&rdquo; and try to conquer the Serbs in the South. The mission will be complicated by the perseverance of those enemies; the difficulties with new fronts in Romania, the Balkans, and the Italian border; and the difficulty of keeping the Empire's restive nationalities from revolting from Hapsburg Rule.<br/><br/>The war started poorly for the Austro-Hungarians, with major Russian advances in the East and no progress against the Serbians. As time went on and the Austro-Hungarians bounced from one crisis to another, the Germans started to take more control as the price for their aid. In the end, the war was too much for the disparate nationalities of Austria-Hungary to take, and when it became clear that the Central Powers could not win the war, the Austro-Hungarian Empire disintegrated.<br/><br/>Can you succeed in keeping the Hapsburg Monarchy intact?

Created for Fate Core System!<br/><br/>Launched on Kickstarter, Tianxia: Blood, Silk &amp; Jade is now being made available to the world through RPGNow and Drive-Thru RPG! Renowned game designer Jack Norris presents an all-new adventure setting with Kung Fu rules designed from the ground up for the Fate Core roleplaying game. Beautifully illustrated in full color by Denise Jones, this book presents in detail the wild and dangerous Western province of Ji\u0101ngzh\u014du, a border territory in the greater empire of Shenzh\u014du. Players take on the role of Wuxia&mdash;wandering kung fu masters with skills and abilities that grant them the power to affect the fates of many&mdash;who are part of the Jianghu, a select culture of Kung Fu elite whose skills set them apart from other social groups.<br/><br/>Tinaxia: Blood, Silk &amp; Jade is the first of a series of supplements for the Tianxia line. Future books already in the works include the Tianxia Lifepath Generator, which will include an Addendum for using our Kung Fu rules with Fate Accelerated Edition, the Twelve Golden Butchers adventure, and other sourcebooks expanding on different regions of Shenzh\u014du, opening up new gaming vistas like Chinese mysticism and epic battle scale combat.<br/><br/>Tianxia: Blood, Silk &amp; Jade is designed for Evil Hat Productions&rsquo; Fate Core System and requires those rules to play, but the supplemental material is written so that it can be easily used for any role playing system. Your journey through the world of Tianxia begins here: you might be a beggar priest, or the child of the Emperor himself, but it will be your abilities as a Wuxia that shapes your fate&hellip; and the fate of everyone you meet.<br/><br/>"}, "149363": {"poll": [], "name": "Wonderbook: Book of Spells", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Nordic PlayStation 3 edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2577080.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Children's", "Fantasy"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle", "Visual Novel"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["SCE London Studio"], "videogamefranchise": ["Harry Potter"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 3"], "videogamehonor": ["2013 British Academy Game Awards Best Innovation of the Year Nominee"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2577080_t.jpg", "description": "What if a book could come to life?<br/>Master more than 20 spells and turn your living room into the Restricted Section of the Hogwarts library in Wonderbook: Book of Spells on PlayStation 3.

The game is played with two sets of unique six-sided dice. The first set of five dice have six different role-playing attributes on them such as strength or charisma. The other set of dice represent the six different types of jobs the heroes in your party can have based on the attributes they rolled. There are also Fool dice for characters that could not get a job.<br/><br/>On the first four turns, players will roll the five attribute dice up to 3 times in an attempt to give one of their four heroes a job (such as rolling at least three strength to create a Barbarian, or two intelligence and two charisma to create a Summoner). Among the six available job dice there are 24 unique jobs (and one more for the unique Fool Die) to play with.<br/><br/>Once everyone has rolled up their individual parties of four, they have a competition against a deck of cards that represents monsters and traps in a dungeon. They do this by drawing the top card of the dungeon deck and rolling the dice representing their party up to three times against the numbers and tricks on the card. The player is trying to roll enough damage to defeat the monster and enough blocking or healing to stop as much damage as possible. Traps works slightly differently with the party trying to disarm them with either job dice that can do so, or by trying to roll various specific combinations of attribute Dice to manually disarm them. Once they make their final roll for the turn they add up the numbers and see what they scored.<br/><br/>The competition is score based with a very simple system. Players gain 1 point for killing monsters and disarming traps, and another point if they can end the turn having blocked or healed all the damage that monster or trap just did. If a player can both defeat a card and block or heal all the damage in the same turn they gain 3 points instead.<br/><br/>"}, "149393": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Wolfgang Kramer"], "poll": [], "name": "\u00dcber den Wolken", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1998", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Germany"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1804066_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Clementoni"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1804066.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["German First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "An adventurous flight over Germany.<br/><br/>Above the Clouds is an entertaining search-and-strategy game for learning geography.

We have put together a little information that might help giving players a better experience with the game. <br/>Hopefully, this will help improving the enjoyment of the game.<br/><br/>The most essential part of the game is the Space Shop. It must be used or the game will become boring and you are left with a feel of just chasing one another without any tactical considerations. The Space Shop adds strategic/tactical depth to the game.<br/><br/>The game is about making tough decisions figuring out when it will pay off to sell cards and thus earning credits for purchases. When and where you place field equipment is of the utmost importance. Failing at placing your field equipment the right place can cost you the game. Like in chess you must carefully consider your next moves and in accordance to your plan, buy and place field equipment. Credits are not easy to come by, so be sure not to buy field equipment without having carefully planned out a strategy on how to use the field equipment. <br/>Do not expect to keep a favorite weapon throughout the whole game (although it is possible). At a certain point you may have to give it up<br/><br/>Here are a few hints:<br/>Gravitational Enforcers are among other things used for preventing a melee-heavy agents from catching up to you.<br/><br/>Space Tunnels are used to travel vast distances and thus ensuring that enemy agents will not get too far away from you. Keeping them within your reach.<br/> Sentries are very useful to the agents as they give you more fire power. Placed correctly you can cut off fleeing agents or blow down walls  that enemy agents may use as a defensive barrier trying to buy a little time. But placing sentries randomly is just a waste of credits/cards.<br/><br/>Melee weapons. If you are not a really experienced player, you should not only go for strength and melee weapons. As a beginner you should go for precision and intellect and later in the game , you could attempt using the melee weapons as a support weapon.<br/><br/>The game. <br/>IPA - The Agents is a tactical strategy game that takes place in a near future. You take on the roll as one of the agents of &quot;the agency&quot;, who fight other agents in an attempt to find rare objects to his/her employer.<br/><br/>Among many other things the game includes 200 playing cards of which 145 are distinctly different.  These cards are both used as items for in-game fights and they are also used as the currency of the game. The currency can be spend on buying equipment that is placed physically on the gameboard or for buying temporary boosts for your agent.  All cards are valuable in one way or another and you must wisely choose how to use them. This gives an economic aspect to the game as the number of cards at your disposal is limited. <br/> There are small roleplaying elements in the game that make sure that you cannot use an especially powerful  card early in the game. This mechanic is made to reduce the agony of an unbalanced game.  <br/>To strengthen the replay value of the game, the obstacles (walls) of the game are placed on the gameboard before the game starts. This is incorporated into the beginning of the game as a strategic element which ensures that the gameboard looks different every time you play.<br/><br/>There are alternative rules that among other things varies the luck factor of the game. Gamers have different needs when it comes to the luck factor. Now they have the opportunity to adjust the luck factor so it meets with their needs.<br/><br/>We have experimented with a new kind of artform. Every picture is a uniquely hand painted painting made by a Danish artist.<br/><br/>There are many tutorials on our website and we try to make tutorials on request from our fans, if we find a need for it.<br/><br/>The game may look complex, but most players get into the mechanics/dynamics quickly. When we attended the boardgame fair at Essen 2013, we saw that most players had understood and gotten into the mechanics after only 5-6 turns into the game.<br/><br/>We are in the Beta phase of a new game mode called &quot;Vampiric Elite&quot;, which &quot;kills&quot; the player-elimination&quot; part of the game. All players stay in the game until it ends, thus dealing with &quot;Player Elimination&quot; that some people do not like. Instead the winner is found by a unique point system that awards being a good, but somewhat aggressive, tactician. You must be able to deal the most damage possible while staying aloof of enemy attacks. The whole point system is monitored by the agents' life.<br/>In this game mode it is possible for up to 8 players to participate.<br/><br/>Don't miss out on a tactical treat.<br/><br/>"}, "149419": {"average": "0", "videogamebg": ["Monopoly"], "name": "TEGL Monopoly", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat"], "videogameversion": ["DOS Shareware edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1804833.png", "videogametheme": ["Board Game"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["TEGL Systems Corporation"], "videogamegenre": ["Classic Games"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS"], "poll": [], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["TEGL Systems Corporation"], "videogamecompilation": ["The Home Entertainment Shareware Collection: Vol. 6: Simulation Shareware Games"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1804833_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>TEGL Monopoly is a more-or-less faithful shareware recreation of the American version of Parker's classic board game.<br/><br/>The game is played with the mouse or with the keyboard, there is no save-game function and apart from a few beeps there's no sound.<br/><br/>The game starts with the players deciding on their credit limit,  they can have $500, $1000, $2000, $32768 or no credit at all.

Fed up with our defiance and costly ignorance, the golden ones ascended into the heavens, much to our surprise. Then, slowly at first but with increasing frequency, our children were born with gifts. We learned that the gods wanted to apologize and through freeing us from their whips and even granting our children the power of the ascended, the beings we once dreaded, were loved as fathers and mothers. We came to accept them as divine beings, for does not a father or mother disciple their children before they are allowed to make decisions that affect their lives? The gods are benevolent and we even have come to depend upon their charity.<br/><br/>All they ask is for our worship and the rains shall fall, the crops shall grow and we shall be at peace&hellip; or so we thought. Without worship, the gods cannot function and if one loves their god and their way of life, they will fight for it. So, our leaders, mortals and Immortals alike, have created vast armies to spread the word of our benefactors, the supreme beings that rule over us, like omniscient parents.<br/><br/>The characters are played by Immortals that have been gifted by their god&rsquo;s, powers of immense potential and limitless possibility. For their gifts, the gods require the Immortal peoples to pontificate the benevolence of the heavenly-ones through words, actions and deeds. Some Immortals find that politics of leadership and the courts are their strong-suit but more often than not, they take to the fields of battle to vanquish the antithesis of their deities.

These weapons are used for destroying waves of enemy planes and ground and sea units. The main plane is destroyed by one hit. If a certain enemy is destroyed the player can collect a comrade fighter to fight alongside the main plane. Up to two comrade fighters can be collected. The comrade fighters can be assigned to fight in the air to fire bullets or they can be assigned to fight at low altitude to fire air-to-ground rockets. The comrade fighters can also be launched to do a kamikaze attack explosion against the enemy.

Players are dealt five cards. Each card contains two &quot;clues&quot; to a song -- for example &quot;Artist begins with B&quot; or &quot;Genre: Rock&quot;.

If a player cannot play a card they pass; the winner of the round is the last player able to play a card, and they score the number of cards in the tower as points.<br/><br/>The other game is something completely new: a game for teams or individuals to play during karaoke. Players are dealt five cards. Again, each card contains two &quot;clues&quot; to a song, but this time the players must combine as many cards as they can within their own hand to come up with a song to sing. Once they've chosen a song they add it to the playlist. When it's their turn to sing they announce the clues they chose and score points for each card they managed to use. During the song, other players may &quot;duet&quot; and score points for their own cards that match their song. When the song is finished players who have sung refresh their hands from the draw pile.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who has scored the most cards when the draw pile has been exhausted and the playlist completed.<br/><br/>"}, "149473": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1805781.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Greg B.

Being published in an RPG doujinshi, the game has a lot of flavor text/descriptions.<br/><br/>The players decide when to rest or when to move to a different location (from a set of 6 locations), but otherwise is dependent on the luck of the roll. Each turn (defined as 10 years), unless the mother is resting, a die is rolled to determine the needs of the child and the mother then has to match or come within 1 of that die result. Success leads to a roll on a positive event table (modified by the care attribute/skill) while failure leads to a roll on the risky event table for the current location (which are often but not always negative events). In addition, after handling the events, the player may move the family to an adjacent location.<br/>At the end of each turn, tiredness is checked to see whether the next turn is spent resting. When playing with 2+ players, players in the same location may attack each other to steal loot from each other.<br/><br/>The first player to lead the child to adulthood (which requires 20 units of loot) wins the game. Solo play is mentioned as an option, but no special rules are provided and some of the possible player powers are incompatible with solo play.<br/><br/>"}, "149494": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1805729.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Dirk Henn"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "8", "age": "10", "boardgamepublisher": ["Queen Games"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1805729_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Expansion for Base-game"], "description": "Speculation Mini Expansion 2: 7th and 8th Players, a mini-expansion for Speculation, can be used individually or in combination with any other expansions for the game.
