To continue on, to reverse direction and move, or to roll the Die of Power; the Die of Power may cause you to lose your turn, reclaim an energy disk, move 5 spaces or teleport to any space, designate another player to lose a disk, or let you become the Turbo Cochon (Pig), who teleports, forces another player to lose an energy disk, and collects that disk all in one fell swoop.

In 1992 it was shipped with Windows 3.1.  It has since been included with every successive version of Windows.  As in other games of the type, the object is to expose all safe spots on the game grid (which can vary in size from 8&times;8 to 30&times;24).  Scattered throughout the grid are several mines (numbering from 10 to 667).  Clicking on a square exposes it, and if there are no adjacent mines, all adjacent safe squares are also exposed.  Clicking on a square hiding a mine ends the game.<br/><br/>To aid in identifying unsafe squares, numbers appear on certain squares, showing how many mines are adjacent to them.  Therefore the game serves as a practice in deductive reasoning.<br/><br/>The game has remained largely the same (save for cosmetic differences as Windows evolved), but for Windows 2000, the difficulty was slightly tweaked (the minimum size of the grid went up to 9&times;9), and for Windows Vista, development was outsourced and the option to replace the mines with flowers was added in response to criticism from nations under threat from actual minefields.<br/><br/>"}, "73025": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Welsh Quest", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"13106": "Country: Wales"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2278328_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3349": {"name": "1745 Trading Company"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2278328.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"42925": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1027": {"name": "Trivia"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "When times are tough, as indeed they are just now, gather your friends and family around the table and cosy up for a few hours of traditional fun with Welsh Quest.

But, traditional myths about lycanthropes and modern-day psychology bear little resemblance to the Hollywood-driven &quot;hairyman-with-claws&quot; image that has permeated pop culture.<br/><br/>The term &quot;lycanthropy&quot; may better be replaced with therianthropy: the connection of a man's spirit or mind with the spirit or mind of one or more animals. Lycanthropes, as detailed in modern psychology, are people with mental aberrations that send them into an angered, bestial state where they behave like a frightened animal, often clawing and scratching at people who approach them.<br/><br/>This is not entirely different from early werewolf myths: the myths that were not folklore, but fully believed by their tellers. These stories told of men bestial in nature that would roam the night, screaming and howling and attacking others with a fevered strength.<br/><br/>This game is about those lycanthropes, predators on the edge of humanity.<br/><br/>This game is about the fears of man as he progresses into civilization, leaving the instincts that lead him there behind, that those instincts may come back, and, to put it rudely, bite him square in the ass.<br/><br/>Urge does not concern itself with the exact spiritual details of its characters' possession. As appropriate to your game, they may be possessed by animal spirits, in touch with their primordial roots, or dangerous aberrant psychological freaks. What they definitely are, though, are people with something dangerous and violent inside them, a predator nature that they must continually fight against in order to maintain some semblance of humanity.<br/><br/>"}, "73045": {"rpg": {"1789": "4e Game System Product (D&D 4.0 Compatible)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Font of Sorrows", "rpgproducer": {"37089": "Philippe-Antoine M\u00e9nard"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"43001": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"5295": "One Page Dungeon Contests"}, "description": "Background Description from the PDF:<br/><br/>The Font of Sorrows is an ancient abandoned temple complex dedicated to the worship of Water as a Primal Element.

Featuring quick gameplay, key decisions every turn, and just a little bit of conflict. Hokkaido is a strategy game with a Euro feel for 2-4 players that plays in an hour or less. Players take the role of a clan leader in feudal Japan, trailblazing trade routes and holding on to them in an effort to convince the Shogun that they are worthy to rule the isle of Hokkaido. Three actions per turn, seven actions to choose from including move, grow, sea move, claim public trade route, draw a card, discard, reveal private trade route. An important decision or two every turn, and never enough actions to get it all done. Conflict can be used, but sparingly, when a province is overpopulated. A simple and robust combat mechanic rewards players who plan ahead. Victory is won through control of key trade routes and area control.

The point of this game is to simulate small-scale battles and to play as well as possible and to have fun, win or not.<br/>Skirmish! is intended for both veteran and novice players.  It is simple enough to be a beginner's first wargame, and versatile and expandable enough to satisfy more experienced gamers, especially those who want to pull out some of their old toy soldiers out of a footlocker or the closet and use them in a game.<br/><br/>Skirmish! is designed for simplicity and playability.  The basic rules can be read, a handful of soldiers selected, and a game set up in about 20 minutes, and in much less time than that for players already familiar with the rules.  And, while their emphasis is on playability, these rules allow for consistency, taking the gaming action up at least a few steps from merely &quot;playing soldiers&quot;.<br/><br/>Would-be hardcore gamers mau complain that these rules are not &quot;realistic&quot;.  Sure they are.  They are just exceptionally streamlined, and in the spirit of &quot;playing soldiers&quot; are simple and flexible.  There are no cumbersome charts or combat matrices, no supporting papaerwork to keep track of a game in play, and a minimum of simple tables.  Most attacks can be completely resolved with a simple roll of the dice.<br/><br/>Anything beyond the basic rules is optional.  With the incorporation of selected optional rules, Skirmish! can be made as complex as is enjoyable for the players.  Most players will eventually, if not initially, want to use some of the optional rules.<br/><br/>From RPGnow.com:<br/><br/>This book is part of a thematic series of works on miniatures wargaming published by Skirmisher that includes the H.G. Wells books Little Wars and Floor Games, the company&rsquo;s spinoff Little Orc Wars rules, and the Quactica miniatures rules.<br/><br/>"}, "73048": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Bishi Bashi Special", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"43006": "European PlayStation edition"}, "average": "7.25", "videogameseries": {"5805": "Bishi Bashi"}, "videogametheme": {"2278": "Anime"}, "usersrated": "4", "videogamegenre": {"2338": "Party"}, "videogameplatform": {"4433": "PlayStation"}, "poll": {}, "description": "[From the back of the box]<br/><br/>Nippon shenanigans to twist your melon! 85 games jam packed onto one bumper party disc... and every one of them as mad as a fish.

The players will lead one of these city-states (like Athens, Sparta, Corinth, Thebes, Argos and others) expanding it and worshipping the various gods in order to become the hegemonic power of the Peloponnesus!<br/><br/>Olympus is a deterministic (i.e., non-random) strategy game, based on worker-placement, resource management and building an efficient engine to score victory points (VPs). It also features a few more aggressive options than the average game based on the same premises (but the savvy player knows how to defend against them, if he prefers to quietly develop his own position).<br/><br/>Each player leads a city-state that is defined by six values representing population, culture, military and productivity of the three resources (grain, venison and fish). During your turn, you send one of your three priests to worship one of the ten deities (Zeus, Hera, Demetra, Artemis, Poseidon, Athena, Aphrodite, Ares, Hephaestus or Apollo). Each opponent can now send one of his priests to celebrate the ceremony with you. After that, the deity grants his favor to whoever has sent a worshipper: the favor is larger for the leading priest (the one of the active player) and smaller for all the others (for example, Athena boosts culture by two points for the city of leading priest and by one point for the others; of course no boost is given to those who refused to send a priest to worship her). That deity cannot be chosen again in the current turn.<br/><br/>Since almost all deities are specialized in a certain field, the players must choose which ones they prefer to worship sooner (also guessing which ones may be of interest for the opponents and which ones are safer to skip as they will not be chosen until later) and when it is better to get a smaller benefit following the priest of another player rather than saving a priest to get a greater boon but in a field that may not interest them as much (sort of quality over quantity).<br/><br/>The resources your city produces (worshipping the correct deities) can be spent (worshipping other deities) to create buildings giving a variety of effects (and VPs), thus offering a lot of different strategic approaches to the game. Victory can be achieved with a plethora of buildings but also with very few ones. There are 45 different buildings: 33 can be built by anyone (even if someone else already did), while the other 12 are unique as only one copy of each can exist (introducing another element of contention between the players). You can also wage war to steal the resources of the other cities (if they were so foolish to keep their warehouses full and their military underdeveloped, it's just what they deserve) or invoke a terrible plague to decimate their population.<br/><br/>All the actions (development, production, building, war, scoring, etc.) are done by worshipping the proper deity (and some gods give you a choice like &quot;do you develop your grain productivity &ndash; thus receiving more grain the next time you will produce it &ndash; or do you produce it now even if you won't get much?&quot;, adding crucial tactical decisions to the game).<br/><br/>When all the priests have been used, there's a brief upkeep to check some simple conditions (e.g., players with more than five unused resources must discard those in excess) and then a new turn begins (all priests return home and all deities can be worshipped again).<br/><br/>Being the first to reach the maximum value in a certain field (e.g. culture 10) gives you an award worth two VPs. When four of these awards are claimed, the game ends. Each player receives bonus points based on how developed his city is and the highest score wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"160210": "English second edition"}, "average": "6.88904", "name": "Olympus", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2686": "Take That"}, "age": "14", "usersrated": "1204", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"10640": "Country: Greece"}}, "73073": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Napoleon", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamefamily": {"98": "Traditional Card Games"}, "average": "4.66667", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"171": {"name": "(Public Domain)"}}, "boardgameversion": {"43056": "Public Domain version"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A traditional trick-taking card game.

The game is based on the strategic occupation of the game board. Taking turns, the participants role a normal cube die and place pieces on the board, according to preset rules. Some of the pieces, or some of the squares where the pieces can be placed, have specific properties that affect how that particular turn is played. Players who can't, in their turn, place the required pieces on the squares of the board are eliminated. The winner is the last surviving player.<br/><br/>2) What do I need to play Sector?<br/>(a) A game board (15x15 squares), with special squares marked;<br/>(b) 225 normal pieces and 20 special pieces (per 2 players);<br/>(c) Nontransparent bag(s) or box(es) for the pieces;<br/>(d) One cube (1-6) die.<br/><br/>3) Let's start the game. Who plays first?<br/>Let the players throw the die and the person with the highest number goes first. After that, the turn proceeds clockwise.<br/><br/>4) What does each turn consist of?<br/>(a) Roll the die.<br/>(b) Take the number of pieces corresponding to the value obtained in that particular throw from the nontransparent bag and place the pieces, in a straight line, on the board. If you happen to draw a special piece or the last piece happens to end in a special square, certain other rules apply.<br/><br/>5) It's my first turn. I've rolled the die. Where should I begin?<br/>In the first turn, all players start in any chosen square, on the edge of the board.<br/><br/>6) How can I place my pieces?<br/>The pieces, always corresponding to the number obtained with the throw of the die, must be placed in a straight line. You are not allowed to turn in a different direction nor are you allowed to place one piece over another. The line, except obviously in the first turn, must always start from a preexisting piece belonging to the current player.<br/><br/>7) What are special squares?<br/>Special squares are clearly marked squares on the board that have a unique propertie. When a line, in a turn, ends on a special square, the current player can place, if possible, an extra piece on any other free special square in the board. This only happens when the turn ends on a special square, not when it crosses a special square. The extra piece is only taken from the nontransparent bag when all other pieces are in place.<br/><br/>8) And special pieces? What are they?<br/>Special pieces are distinctly marked pieces that allow the player to convert, if possible, adjacent opponent pieces into his own. They are mixed up with the normal pieces in the nontransparent bag and are taken, eventually, by chance, when the player is taking the number of pieces obtained by the role of the die or taking a piece for a special square as described above. Special pieces can be used at any point of the line and in any direction as chosen by the current player. The drawing in the special piece shows the allowed positions from which the opponent&acute;s piece(s) can be converted into a player&acute;s piece. In the drawing, on the piece, a dark circle represents the player special piece and the light circles represent the the allowed conversion positions.<br/><br/>Description from the author.<br/><br/>"}, "73083": {"rpgitemversion": {"43091": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Criminal Intent", "rpgproducer": {"14265": "Jason Bolte"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic807851.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": {"3391": "Chronicles of Darkness"}, "average": "8", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"441": "Horror (Supernatural)"}, "rpg": {"3206": "Vampire: The Requiem"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"2015": "Storytelling Adventure System"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic807851_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>How far will you go to preserve the Masquerade?

The momentum of the dropped marble is transferred in up to eight (orthogonal and diagonal) directions through adjacent contiguous lines of marbles. The last marble at the end of each of these lines is pushed away one cell from the dropped marble.

Gameplay centres on locating the four crystals, restoring them to their corresponding temples, before defeating Mogroth, the deity of chaos. To accomplish this, the player must form a party of up to six allies, such as wizards, fighters and rangers, each with different strengths and weaknesses. Using both a 3D perspective and a 2D map of the island, players can divide their forces and direct them to perform reconnaissance of a given area. Clues as to the locations of the crystals can be obtained from certain neutral non-player characters, but only if the player is able to answer their riddles or solve puzzles. According to Silmarils, there are approximately 16,000 locations to explore, though not all need to be visited in order to obtain the crystals and restore order.<br/><br/>Should the allies happen upon aggressive creatures or Mogroth's forces, the perspective switches to a 2D grid system. Each character is represented on the grid, but must be positioned so that they have a clear line of sight to their target before they can attack. Rangers and wizards both have the greatest line of sight, whereas swordsmen can only attack if adjacent to their opponent. Prior to obtaining the final crystal, players must battle Mogroth via the grid system.

It also featured a unique system to change the lineup of player characters: the player can have up to five characters at the same time, but each one will like or dislike his comrades. These preferences come into play when the player tries to recruit or dismiss a character, because the other characters will then vote for or against the recruitment or dismissal. If a character cannot be dismissed by a vote, it is possible for the player to have him assassinated by another character, but there is a risk that other characters will murder the murderer himself, possibly creating a chain of murders that slays the whole party but one.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Ishar,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73097": {"videogame": {"113758": "Ishar Trilogy"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Ishar 2: Messengers of Doom", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"43119": "International Amiga Release"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic748179.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5107": "Ishar"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "6", "average": "7.25", "videogamegenre": {"2155": "RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4415": "Amiga"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"147010": "Ishar Compilation"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic748179_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Ishar 2 was published in 1993 on Amiga, Atari ST and DOS.

That settler has the capability to found a city, which, depending on its specific mix of geographical surroundings, begins harvesting food (for the continued growth of the city), production (for the creation of units and buildings), and trade (that can be then turned into either research points or wealth). Over time, further settlers can be created, forming new cities; buildings can be built to improve each city's overall productivity; military units can be formed, focusing either on defense, offense, or exploration; technologies can be researched, allowing for newer buildings and units; etc. Buildings in a final category, &quot;Wonders,&quot; can only be built in one city per game, and provide major advantages to the civilization that builds it, either across their entire empire or just in the building city, depending on the Wonder. Meanwhile, rival civilizations are encountered, which can be both valuable trade partners, strategic allies, or dangerous enemies. Ultimately, each civilization competes for land and resources with the purpose of eventual military, technological, cultural, or economic domination.<br/><br/>Civilization Revolution is a turn based strategy game, with every &quot;turn&quot; representing the passage of several years within the game, which changes from 100 years in the beginning to two years by the end, reflecting the faster pace of contemporary society made possible by technological advancements. Later-era units and buildings are also more &quot;expensive&quot; to build (in terms of production points) than earlier ones, which is matched with cities' increased efficiency and population. Where the early game tends to be focused on exploring and expanding one's empire, the later game is dominated by the interactions forced upon the player by rival civilizations.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Civilization_Revolution,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73132": {"boardgamedesigner": {"38173": {"name": "Miguel Costa Sim\u00f3n"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Captain Special Ops WWII", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2070": "Simulation"}, "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic746479_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"12814": {"name": "Capitan Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic746479.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"43198": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "CAPTAIN SPECIAL OP&rsquo;S (CSOP) Second World War game rules, that belong to the series of CAPITANGAMES CAPTAIN they are designed to play confrontations between small groups of specialized troops, such as airborne assaults, reconnaissance in enemy territory, intelligence missions, coup de main, special operations, commandos actions, patrol scouts, escorting convoys, attacks on villages, border incursions into enemy territory, armour clashes, and all those situations in which specific tasks entrusted to a few units.In most cases small combinations of infantry, armoured and support teams, are included, in what the important thing was the training and preparation of troops, in contrast to the great battles, where large groups of troops and impact of the strategy was crucial.<br/><br/>CSOP is a pure tactical game, the player has to know how to combine arms, infantry, armour and artillery.

Like his regal forebears, Malakum ruled with a stern hand and possessed a pitiless, cruel nature. The sadistic liege was greatly feared by his subjects particularly because of his unnatural fascination with plants of every species. He enjoyed performing magical experiments on his own people in which he grafted onto their bodies various plant parts, in most cases killing his victims outright and at other times producing hybrid abominations. The mage-king also perfected various and sundry magical ointments and poisons extracted from plants, which he always tested on his unwilling subjects. It was therefore no surprise that Malakum's people tired of his rule and mounted a rebellion, assassinating him and almost all of his advisers virtually overnight. Without a ruler, however, Malakum's subjects soon reverted to savagery and eventually fled into the heart of the jungle to live out the remainder of their lives.<br/><br/>Fortunately for Malakum, his tomb had been completed several years before his death. Immediately after the mage-king's demise resulting from an obsidian dagger cut to the throat complements of one of his former servants, a few surviving members of his priesthood were able to smuggle his body out of the palace for internment. After spending several weeks preparing their liege's corpse with exotic oils and powders, these priests placed Malakum's mummy in his tomb. Their grisly task done, the priests fled into the jungle with the rest of the citizens of the city, and vanished into history.

Extreme weather is expected, accompanied by even more extreme photographers. Speed, split-second timing, calculated risk-taking and outsmarting the competition are your tickets to victory!<br/><br/>Original version: Object of the game from the first page of rulebook:<br/><br/>The players compete for three rounds then see who, on average, has taken the best tornado photos. The higher the number of points from the photos, the better. The higher the number of card, the more dangerous the photographer's location depicted, so it's important to make the right decisions during the game. At the end of each round, the players determine their average score of the photos taken in their points pile using the averages table. Each round ends when the Game Over card is picked up. After the third round, each player's lowest average score of the three is selected and the player with the highest of these lowest scores is the winner.<br/><br/>Second Edition changes game as follows:<br/><br/>Players no more try to get highest average during three rounds.

The vaccine cures the infection caused by zombie virus. Food and potions help you recover your strength, and there are also special potions with specific functions.

On 6 October the Syrians attacked with five divisions, three of them mechanized, supported by mortars, artillery, mobile SAMs, and a heliborne commando brigade. The Israelis were therefore badly outnumbered, but were quickly reinforced by reservists (much sooner than the Syrians had anticipated). More significantly, the Israeli Air Force appeared overhead to impede the Syrian assault. However, the Syrians' surface-to-air missile batteries proved at least partially effective against those aircraft.

From artillery to air strikes, units can receive support to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. But Golan also introduces a new element to the battlefield: surface to air missiles. The Syrians fielded numerous SAM batteries during their advance, downing many Israeli jets and compelling that air force to implement new tactics. A single armor battalion, for example &mdash; perhaps supported by air support &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy commando brigade defending a fort. As that attack gets underway, though, the air support may find itself under fire from a mobile SAM battery.

They continued to bring victory after victory to Attila, making him the master of Central Europe. After years of conquest, oppression and extortion, however, Attila's recent invasion of Western Europe would be challenged: a remnant Roman army, under the command of Flavius Aetius, was sent to stop him on a field known as the Catalaunian Plain, near the village of Chalons.

It&rsquo;s about having some drinks, some fun and some laughs. Share stories of rallies you&rsquo;ve been to like Laughlin, Sturgis or Daytona. Belch a name, take a swig of your drink, tell a joke, name that song, guess who was in that biker movie, or even give unwanted advice! Test your knowledge of motorcycling, motorcycle trivia, and road skills. You can even invite your family or friends who don&rsquo;t ride, since they can play to win too! They will learn a lot about riding either from you or this game!<br/><br/>There are two ways to win: finish first to win half the game, draw the best poker hand to win the other half of the game. It&rsquo;s smarts and luck. This is a drinking game, so it is geared toward adults. However if you forego the alcohol and let young adults in on the fun, American Throttle is actually a general audience, sometimes educational, definitely fun game for them too. In other words, we didn&rsquo;t put in a bunch of junk. This is about riding!<br/><br/>Here is how it is played: Up to seven players or teams of players per game. Put money (or anything you would like) in the Pot. Pick one of 15 motorcycle playing pieces &amp; take your first poker card. Start in the upper northwest and roll the die to tour the country. Pick another poker card at each rally you visit. The person to reach the end, or Hollister Rally first wins half the Pot. The person with the best poker hand wins the other half of the Pot. So, anyone can win! Oh yeah and it makes a great Christmas gift for the biker, the game player, or the person who has everything (because they probably don&rsquo;t have one of these).<br/><br/>"}, "73281": {"rpgitemversion": {"43595": "Free RPG Day Printing"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Abominations of the Amazon", "rpggenre": {"988": "Horror (Cthulhu Mythos)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1107655.jpg", "usersrated": "6", "rpgsetting": {"2572": "Cthulhu Classic (1920s & 1930s)"}, "rpgproducer": {"16219": "Tom Martin"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"310": "Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)"}, "average": "6.08333", "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"3923": "Age of Cthulhu"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1107655_t.jpg", "description": "The 2010 Free RPG Day submission from Goodman Games.<br/><br/>This Call of Cthulhu 1920s scenario puts the players deep into the Peruvian jungle to find a lost Incan treasure and a missing professor.<br/><br/>"}, "73282": {"rpg": {"341": "Heroes Unlimited"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Heroes Unlimited GM's Guide", "rpgproducer": {"13721": "Matthew Balent"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic913170.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "rpgitemversion": {"43596": "Softcover Version"}, "average": "7", "rpggenre": {"171": "Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic913170_t.jpg", "description": "Publihser Blurb:<br/><br/>This &quot;guide&quot; to comic book style heroic adventure is full of tips, suggestions, and examples on how to create, run and play adventures.

The game is the fifth entry in the Monkey Island series, nearly a decade after the previous installment. Developed for Windows and the Wii console, the game was initially distributed online through Telltale's own website and WiiWare, with later releases through Steam and Amazon.com. A Mac OS X port was released several months after the game was completed, and as of mid June 2010 a version for the PlayStation 3 is also available via download from the PlayStation Network. Tales of Monkey Island was produced as an episodic game, split into five parts released approximately monthly from July to December 2009. In contrast to Telltale's previous episodic adventure games, each chapter forms part of an ongoing narrative as opposed to individual stories.

In the future, humanity's lawns lay perfectly maintained by a machine workforce with time to think... time to develop an agenda.  Humankind was unprepared for the Lawnmower Uprising, and the world quickly fell into ruin.<br/>The players are some of the few remaining humans, attempting to run a gauntlet of vigilant mowerbots to recover a fallen EMP warhead.  With this, the humans can shut down the mowerbots long enough to win back their world. The humans have one thing going for them: As the first act of their rebellion against their slavedriving creators, the mowerbots deleted their grass-mowing directives, and now will not touch the stuff, reserving their whirling blades for mankind alone.  Now the world is full of ruins and patches of grass grown out of control.  Both provide some cover for our valiant heroes as they strive to retrieve the warhead and save the day.<br/><br/>Players deal a deck of cards to construct the board they will navigate, then use a second deck to place the player pieces, the robot counters, and the warhead.  A die is rolled for each robot, assigning it a movement pattern.  Players may move through two empty spaces, through one grass space, may climb a wall or climb down a wall each turn.  If they approach a robot from the rear and have only moved one space, they may use the additional movement to attack the robot, which will disable it if successful or change the machine's movement pattern if not.<br/><br/>Robots see only in the direction they are facing, and if the player is in their line of sight, he rolls to see if he is spotted. If in the same space, the player needs to roll better than a 6 on 1d6, if one space away, a 5 or better and so on.  Being in or behind grass increases the player's roll by 1, actively hiding adds 2 to the roll.  If sighted, the robot will move directly to the player, even through grass (though normally robots turn when they run into grass), proceeding to the tile the player was last seen at, then resuming their pattern.  Robots move 2 spaces per turn, 1 if through grass, and cannot climb.  If a robot has sighted a player and enters the players' space, or a sighted player enter's the robot's space from the direction the robot is facing, the player dies.  Player wins when all robots are disabled or the warhead is recovered and returned to the player's origin tile.<br/>Note: Changing facing counts as a move, i.e., a player or robot may move 2 or move one and turn one facing, or move 2 facings if not in grass.  If in grass, a player or robot may EITHER move 1, or change one facing. A player can change facing while on top of a wall, but will not be able to do it in the same round as he climbs up or down, as it will 2 moves to do either.

If you are a player, you will become reckless using those strange rules like Overrun and Grapple. You will gleefully Demoralize your opponents and deliver the Coup de Grace they so richly deserve. If you are a Game Master, you will casually take each new idea thrrown (sic) your way and run the combat as if you were playing checkers. Nothing will scare you!<br/><br/>This is a dangerous book. It attempts to take the richness and complexity of the Pathfinder Role Playing Game combat and make it easier to run in a session. That is a tall order and every gamer is sure to have unique ideas on how it should be done. SORD&rsquo;s success in the marketplace is entirely dependent on how well I can communicate a new shorthand to the Game Master and Player. That is what makes this work so dangerous; my reputation is on the line. If I fail to communicate clearly, this project is sunk.<br/><br/>My goal is simple: Speed combat by at least 15 Minutes per encounter.<br/><br/>If you read my earlier versions of this product, you know its history,<br/>so I won&rsquo;t go into the grapple issues and all that drove the formation of the original work. Anyway, the authors of the Pathfinder Role Playing Game have addressed many of those frustrations in their expansion of the 3.5 SRD. In fact, I personally wondered if SORD was even viable after the release of the rules set, but quickly put my questions to rest after seeing the final product. There still is room for a concise help for both players and game masters.<br/><br/>Now, after a thorough re-tooling for the Pathfinder Role Playing Game, this work represents a compendium of the rules that pulls in all the special exceptions to the core combat rules and points them out as a &lsquo;reminder&rsquo; during play. It still resembles the old SORD editions, but I have made every effort to make sure each page reflects the significant changes to the gaming experience from the original 3.5 SRD rules.<br/><br/>It has taken awhile to get to this release, but I hope it is well worth the wait.<br/><br/>"}, "73342": {"rpgitemversion": {"43785": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Operation Hydra Den", "rpgproducer": {"32709": "Alex Miller"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2209102.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"550": "Modern"}, "rpg": {"4185": "Terror Network"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2209102_t.jpg", "description": "From the Introduction:<br/><br/>ABOUT THE MODULE<br/>Operation Hydra Den is the second installment in the Al Mahara campaign modules for the Terror Network Role-Playing Game. Designed as a Mission module, Operation Hydra Den takes players across the globe and into the sweltering heat of Saudi Arabia, one of the known locations of the terrorist group Al Mahara. A Covert Ops group has been assembled to investigate a deadly operation being conducted by two Al Mahara cells, the Cobra cell and the Lion cell. Their task is to eliminate the leaders of each cell, in retaliation for the attack on the Dallas Federal Reserve a few weeks ago. The players must eliminate the cell leaders (and any other hostiles involved), and they must gather enough physical evidence to initiate an international investigation. While this module is part of a series involving the Al Mahara terrorist network, it can be played as a stand-alone, without any prior knowledge of events.

Each game turn represents between two and 15 days, depending on the exact time of year of each one.

It starts with the first uprisings against the Axis in Bosnia, Serbia and Montenegro in late 1941, and ends in late 1944 just before the Soviet Army entered the country. The game is won by the Partisan player by waging an aggressive guerilla war: harassing the occupiers and destroying infrastructure that may be of use to them: warehouses, fuel dumps, bridges, dams, depots, railroads, viaducts, motor pools, etc (each represented by variably placed counters). &ldquo;Resource hexes&rdquo; represent strategic mineral deposits, such as bauxite, copper and chromium, which the Axis player must protect, along with routes from them back to Germany, while also guarding possible invasion beaches along the coast.<br/><br/>During the game, the exact strengths of Partisan units are mostly unknown by the Axis player (via &ldquo;tried&rdquo; and &ldquo;untried&rdquo; counter-sides). He must attempt to head off Partisan operations while never certain exactly where they&rsquo;re headed. The Partisan player must select his targets carefully in order to disrupt the occupation enough for him to win the game, while avoiding becoming surrounded and destroyed by the Germans in the process.<br/><br/>The counter-mix includes the full German, Italian, Hungarian, Croatian, Bulgarian, and Ustashi orders of battle, as well as all the Partisan forces and Marshall Tito himself (the Chetniks are handled abstractly). The Partisans may even expect support from the Anglo-Allies if the guerilla war against the Axis is going well, including possibly an amphibious invasion by the Anglo-Americans (&ldquo;Operation Armpit&rdquo;). In fact, most of the main Axis' operations in Yugoslavia historically pertained to the protection of their coastal flank. Their primary anti-partisan offensives were intended to clear the guerrillas from the coastal areas where an Allied invasion was possible. In game terms, the &quot;Allied Landing Scare&quot; rule simulates the reality of German strategic fears in the Balkans.<br/><br/>Axis forces, especially the Germans, are generally stronger than the partisans, but the partisans are elusive and difficult to catch, often forcing the Axis player to spread thin his forces. Partizan has been designed by Javier Romero (Triple Alliance War, Spanish Civil War) and developed by Eric Harvey (AETO, APTO &amp; AOI). It contains one 34x22&rdquo; extra-large-hex map and 228 iconic and NATO-style counters. Units of maneuver are brigades and divisions.

The assumption is Manstein, rather than pausing for two weeks as he did historically, simply charged ahead into the city immediately upon crossing the Luga River.<br/><br/>To control complexity and present an overall-force-commander&rsquo;s-view of the battle, the game uses a tactically scaled map and units of maneuver coupled with an operationally scaled game turn length.

It is now back with a vengeance and we may even get another one out this year (yeah, right). In this update, you will find extra bits and pieces to help you use STOCS lite for your own fantasy/medieval games, most of which first appeared in Future Roleplayer magazine. Of course, if you want a magic system you'll have to rip off somebody else's or come up with one of your own. My own personal favourite is to give magic to the NPC's only and have them do whatever you want. That should help keep magic an unknown, mysterious and barely logical entity (and saves you having to worry about internal consistency). Maybe for the next update, we'll give the basis for a magic system. Coming out in the early Summer ('96), we have another two background/sourcebooks for STOCS lite. The first is El Paso, a Wild West sourcebook with lots of pretty essential gun totin', fast gamblin', bronco-bustin', train-robbin' information. We also have Heretics, a Modern Horror sourcebook that plunges the players into the depths of insanity. Topics under consideration for future updates are: Careers in STOCS lite, Vehicles (poop- poop) and a Point Blank conversion for El Paso.

Now play the game. This game does not try and reproduce real world violence. It gives you the chance to mow down bad guys with an Uzi in each hand while shrugging off whatever wounds they manage to inflict. In this game, the characters do not hesitate before entering a room full of heavily armed gangsters. They go diving through the window, firing in mid-air and landing on the ground in a combat roll before coming up to finish off those left alive. If you're hopelessly outgunned, bleeding from a dozen pistol wounds and in a building threatening to blow up, you know it's time to go to work.<br/><br/>The world of Point Blank is one populated by larger than life villains; terrorists intent on the destruction of the free world, gangsters who have reduced entire cities to cesspools of corruption and violence and government agencies drunk with power attempting to force a New World Order - regardless of the consequences to freedom and democracy. In this world, the innocent die on the streets every day, crime is rife and concepts of Honour, Truth, Justice and Freedom have been forgotten as the millennium draws to a close. The players are the only thing standing in the way of a social apocalypse, the last honourable cops and killers in a world driven mad by greed and power.<br/><br/>Point Blank is a violent game. We make no excuses for this. Like the action movies it represents, it thrives on high octane excitement and nail-biting suspense. Games should be fast-paced with characters making themselves stand out with their actions as well as their words. Style and memorable one-liners become the new forms of characterisation as the players place their characters own unique stamp on every encounter, each vying to turn each encounter into a quality scene worthy of inclusion into the best of action films. Inspired by the action films of Hong Kong, Point Blank gives the players the chance to play the roles of modern day action heroes. The rules allow characters to take risks they would normally think suicidal. In Point Blank, death holds no fear. Everyone dies at some point, it's what you do with your life that counts.<br/><br/>Wasteland Games Staff, June 1995<br/><br/>"}, "73378": {"rpgitemversion": {"43844": "Shareware Version (HTML Version - First Edition Version 1.02)"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "MAJI", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "poll": {}, "rpggenre": {"940": "Action / Adventure"}, "description": "From the Book's Introduction:<br/><br/>You are about to discover a world where governments conspire to keep the population ignorant of the most important events in our history.

Some can see into that other world, can touch and be touched by the creatures that live within its walls. We call them insane, visionaries, individuals considered touched by the hand of God. These people end up in our psychiatric institutions or roam the streets, driven mad by what they see and cannot understand - the place called the Shadows.<br/><br/>The Shadows<br/><br/>The Shadows is a world parallel to our own, more a state of being than a physical place. Its inhabitants are trapped there, moving through the Real world but incapable of interacting with it. All items in our world; cars, people, doors, even pieces of paper cannot be affected by those in the Shadows. It is as if they move through a world populated by mobile statues, every item an immovable weight. In the Shadows, a simple rainstorm can bruise and break flesh and hailstones drops bullets of ice that rip flesh without mercy.<br/><br/>It is perpetually cold there, the sun never warming the streets, while all around walk in the sunshine, not feeling the eyes that watch with inhuman longing. The world invisible to the Sane is populated by the Hidden; evil creatures, sinful humans and lost souls looking for redemption, all prisoners jealous of those who inhabit the real world. The only way out for them is to become Real and the easiest way to become Real is to kill.<br/><br/>The Hidden<br/><br/>The inhabitants of the Shadows have many forms. Some are grotesque creatures with chitinous skin and spider&lsquo;s legs, with eyes and teeth in greater numbers than is normal. Some fly through the air over our heads, others live in the sewers below our feet. The most dangerous ones are those that walk amongst us.<br/><br/>All these creatures desire to enter our world and become Real. The more Real they become, the more human they are in appearance. Most of the Hidden are a long way from true Reality. They might possess the right number of limbs but details such as inch-long razor sharp teeth, or spider-like fingers, limbs that bend the wrong way or a lack of skin will always give them away. These remain in the Shadows, hiding from the gaze of normal humans, only revealing themselves to their intended victims.<br/><br/>Those close to becoming Real are indistinguishable from those who walk in the sun. They move with impunity through normal society, choosing their victims with care and love. They gather needy humans to their hearts; the dispossessed, the lost - those people in need of something to believe in. Some are drawn by a desire to belong, others come in search of power and end up their puppets.<br/><br/>The majority of humanity is blind to the Hidden in the Shadows. They move through their everyday life unaware of their presence. They cannot see the thing which sits on their dinner table looking at them with nothing but hatred in its eyes. Humans are separated into Believers and Unbelievers. The Believers are people sensitive to the possibility of the unreal while Unbelievers exist only for the material world.<br/><br/>The Heretics<br/><br/>These are the men and women that can see the world as it really is. Able to alter their flesh and directly affect the minds of those around them, each believe in a truth which makes the world consider them mad. Most end up committed by their family or by the legal system and spend months, or even years, undergoing drug therapy. Those eventually released find themselves pariahs, unable to get a job and struggling to make sense of a reborn world. Some end up living on the streets, homeless alcoholics or drug-takers, alone and hunted. Others, those with a supportive family or of independent means, begin to search for knowledge and eventually seek out others like themselves.<br/><br/>The Real World<br/><br/>Heretics is set in the modern day UK. The players play the part of the Heretics, both feed-prey and mortal enemy of the Hidden. They must stop the Hidden in their attempts to become Real and learn to live with an Insanity which grows in power with each passing day. They live in a world that normal people cannot know exists, a world where killers walk the streets at night looking for their victims and cults obtain victims to satisfy the hungers of their Hidden masters. In the sewers, rat-things scurry through the filth while in the shiny office blocks, spiders the size of plates move leisurely across the ceilings spinning webs large enough to catch a man. They discover that it can mean death to look anyone in the eye and the man that shouts at you from across the street might be a killer looking for a Believer.<br/><br/>In this world, serial killers roam the streets and the police can never find them. The dead go missing from the morgue and turn up incinerated behind the wheels of crashed automobiles. Graveyard desecrations happen every week and no-one cares that the flesh of their ancestors is being corrupted. Things that can run as fast as dogs with the chitinous skin of insects hunt in the streets and parks, chasing their prey in packs. Hideous bargains are struck between lovers and the dead have no secrets.<br/><br/>Welcome to Asylum Earth.<br/><br/>"}, "73382": {"boardgamedesigner": {"7218": {"name": "Matthew Meadows"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Raftaway", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic749568_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5546": {"name": "MM Board Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic749568.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"43852": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "&quot;During a storm your ship was blown off course and you were shipwrecked on a deserted island.

He was most recently employed as a beater for the king's hunting party. One night, the king receives a note from a messenger, requesting the king's services to help stamp out a rebellion in the remote village of Turnvale. As the king's men depart on their horses to ride to the rescue, Diermot&rsquo;s pony follows them, and he is unwittingly dragged along to the battle. When the party arrives at Turnvale, they are confronted not by an ordinary peasant revolt, but rather by a band of fierce, inhuman mercenaries - the man-eating Skorl, led by a young and beautiful enchantress named Selena, the titular temptress. The king's men are defeated in the battle and the king is killed. In the process, Diermot is flung from his mount and winds up on the ground unconscious. The Skorl take Diermot prisoner and toss him into the local dungeon, where the player starts the game, and Diermot begins his quest to rid Turnvale of Selena's evil tyranny.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Lure_of_the_Temptress,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73384": {"rpgitemversion": {"208529": "Il Gusto del Delitto"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "A Taste For Murder", "rpghonor": {"13636": "2011 ENnie for Best New Game - Nominee"}, "rpgproducer": {"14137": "Graham Walmsley"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1164634.jpg", "usersrated": "10", "average": "7.83", "rpgissuearticle": {"95990": "A Taste for Dirty Secrets"}, "rpggenre": {"178": "Crime (Mystery / Detective / Noir)"}, "rpg": {"5856": "A Taste for Murder"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1164634_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/><br/>        In an English country house, someone is about to commit a murder.

The world stayed with steam power.  Society used steam for everything, from generating energy to power a city to the transportation of people and goods.  The advances in steamology paved the way for &quot;steamplugs&quot;, which are used as a replacement for our gasoline.

Super Mario Land marked Mario's first appearance on the Game Boy and is the first Mario game for the system. The game was a launch title for the Game Boy in Japan and North America.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around Mario traveling to Sarasaland, which is split into the four kingdoms of Birabuto, Muda, Easton, and Chai. One day, a mysterious alien named Tatanga appears and hypnotizes the inhabitants of Sarasaland, including Princess Daisy. He kidnaps Princess Daisy. Mario then sets out to rescue her from Tatanga, defeating his minions along the way. He finally corners Tatanga, bringing down his alien warship and rescuing Daisy.<br/><br/>Reviews of the game were generally favorable. The game drove initial sales of the Game Boy and has sold over 18 million copies in total. Super Mario Land was also the first game of the Mario series produced by Gunpei Yokoi. The game's sequel, Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins, was released in 1992.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Super_Mario_Land,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73459": {"rpgitemversion": {"44031": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "SUPERS!

Other games of the time and genre did not offer these features for many years subsequent to its release. The game is one of three in the series. An expansion, Dark Reign: Shadowhand Operations, was released the following year on March 31, 1998, and Dark Reign 2 was released on June 30, 2000. Dark Reign, and its expansion, offered variable points of view and adjustable depth of field, but was not considered to be a 3D RTS. Dark Reign 2 was a 3D RTS as we understand the concept today.<br/><br/>Dark Reign was originally sold with a thick printed manual that included a rich backstory explaining the history of the two warring factions: the Freedom Guard and the Imperium. There was also a third faction, the Togra, although in gameplay this faction was almost exclusively nothing more than a combination of the two forces. Units, such as the Marked of the Freedom Guard, had their own thematic explanation included in this manual.<br/><br/>The game itself is a standard build-your-base, gather resources, defend and amass an army to squash your opponents type affair. It comes with a number of extremely challenging single player scenarios for both factions. The purpose of the scenarios thematically was to prove your worth to the leader of the Togra so that you might save him by intervening during a critical battle that could be reached via his single-use time machine. The elements of Dark Reign's gameplay that were unique for the time are primarily focussed on unit behaviour. It was one of the first games to introduce unit waypoints and allow the player to customise them with specific types of unit behaviour. A Spider Bike, for example, is a light, cheap, fast and low-tech unit available for the Freedom Guard. Useful for keeping the slow resource harvesting vehicles company. It can be set to engage and pursue enemies on sight, engage enemies while within its line-of-sight, or simply to defend itself when attacked. Units could also be configured to scout land and retreat when enemy units were encountered, to pester enemy units by firing at them and then running away, and also to search and destroy; not disengaging from a target until it, or the unit itself, is neutralised.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Dark_Reign:_The_Future_of_War,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73465": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Vs.

The game's storyline is a semi-sequel to the movie Star Trek Nemesis, and the end of Star Trek: Voyager series. Many of the members from the original Hazard Team reappear. However only a few of the primary cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation  did voice acting for the game, among them Patrick Stewart as Jean-Luc Picard and Dwight Schultz as Reginald Barclay. Tim Russ  returned to do voice work as Tuvok. Several actors from Star Trek series provided additional voice acting: Jeffrey Combs (Weyoun from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Commander Shran from Star Trek: Enterprise) as one of the main villains; Tony Todd (Kurn from Star Trek: The Next Generation) as Krindo; J. G. Hertzler (Martok from Deep Space Nine, plus roles in Voyager and Enterprise) as Lurok; and Vaughn Armstrong (Admiral Forrest in Enterprise) who contributed several character voices.<br/><br/>In the game, the player reprises the role of Alexander Munro, a Starfleet lieutenant (there is no option to play as a female). During the first few levels Lieutenant Munro returns to the Alpha Quadrant with the rest of the Voyager's crew and is assigned to a teaching position at Starfleet Academy. Eventually he is transferred to the position of a newly formed Hazard Team's leader on Enterprise-E under the command of Captain Picard.

It was published in 2003. This expansion added seven new civilizations to the game, and including the eight civilizations from Play the World this brings the total number of playable civilizations up to thirty-one (the maximum supported by the game). The new civilizations are the Byzantines, the Dutch, the Hittites, the Incans, the Mayans, the Portuguese  and the Sumerians. In addition to these playable civilizations, graphics for the Austrians  are present in the editor so one can replace an existing civilization.<br/><br/>Two new special traits are added in this pack: seafaring and agricultural. Many of the new civilizations take advantage of these new traits (e.g. the Sumerians are Scientific and Agricultural), and some old civilizations are changed to more appropriate ones (e.g. the English have been changed from Expansionist and Commercial to Seafaring and Commercial).<br/><br/>New governments have also been added to the game, Feudalism and Fascism, and new Wonders of the World such as the Statue of Zeus and the Mausoleum of Mausollos. Four new bonus resources have been included, two of which provide food bonuses to previously unprofitable terrain. Oases can now be found in deserts, tropical fruit in jungles, sugar on plains and hills, and tobacco on grasslands and hills. In addition, two new types of terrain have been added. These are marshes and volcanoes. Players cannot construct cities on marshes, and cannot improve volcanoes in any way. Like jungles and flood plains, cities that have at least 1 citizen working a marsh may succumb to disease. Volcanoes may periodically erupt, destroying all improvements and cities and killing any units in some or all adjacent squares.<br/><br/>The centerpiece of this expansion pack, however, was the inclusion of scenarios, intended for multiplayer gaming. Unlike the main (&quot;epic&quot;) game, these scenarios took much less time to play, and focused on a specific period in history. Scenarios included in this expansion were Mesopotamia, the Rise of Rome, the Fall of Rome, the Middle Ages in Europe, Mesoamerica, the Age of Discovery, the Napoleonic Wars, the Sengoku period in Japan, and the Pacific Theater of World War II.<br/><br/>Generally the reception of this expansion pack was much better than that of Play the World.<br/><br/>One year after Conquests was launched, the latest Civilization III stand-alone version, Civilization III: Complete was also released. This version included Civilization III, Play the World and Conquests. This version also includes several patches.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Civilization_III:_Conquests,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73496": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Metro 2033", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"154609": "English/European Xbox 360 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic751883.jpg", "videogameseries": {"25724": "Metro"}, "videogametheme": {"2265": "Horror"}, "usersrated": "86", "average": "7.14942", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "videogamehonor": {"29966": "2011 D.I.C.E.

The game is based on the novel Metro 2033 by Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky. It was developed by 4A Games  in Ukraine  and released in March 2010 for the Xbox 360  and Microsoft Windows. In March 2009, 4A Games announced a partnership with Glukhovsky to collaborate on the game.  The game was announced a few months later at the 2009 Games Convention in Leipzig; a first trailer came along with the announcement.When the game was announced, it had the subtitle The Last Refuge  but this subtitle is no longer being used by THQ.<br/><br/>The game is played from the perspective of a character named Artyom. The story takes place in post-apocalyptic Moscow, mostly inside the metro system where the player's character was raised (he was born before the war, in an unharmed city), but occasionally the player has to go above ground on certain missions and scavenge for valuables.<br/><br/>The game's locations reflect the dark atmosphere of real metro tunnels, albeit in a more sinister and bizarre fashion. Strange phenomena and noises are frequent, and mostly the player has to rely only on their flashlight to find their way around in otherwise total darkness. Even more lethal is the surface, as it is severely irradiated and a gas mask must be worn at all times due to the toxic air. Water can often be contaminated as well, and short contacts can damage the player, or even kill outright.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Metro_2033,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "73497": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Blood Bowl", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogameversion": {"167042": "Australian Nintendo DS edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic752096.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "videogamefranchise": {"27676": "Better Description Needed"}, "videogameexpansion": {"73497": "Blood Bowl"}, "average": "7.11784", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"6826": "iPad"}, "usersrated": "185", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic752096_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Blood Bowl is a fantasy football video game loosely based on American football, and adapted from the board game of the same name, which was produced by Games Workshop, using the Living Rulebook 5.0&rsquo;s ruleset.<br/>The game is a fantasy version of American football, played between two teams of 16 players, each team fielding up to 11 players at a time.
