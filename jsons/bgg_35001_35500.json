What started as competing protest marches in the streets rapidly escalated into a shooting war between the different factions.   When the President of the Ukraine finally ordered the Army to restore order, several units revolted, and the President appealed to NATO for assistance.<br/><br/>Ignoring Russian warnings against intervening, NATO provided a small UK-led force, which the Russians countered with a reinforced mechanized corps, plus reinforcements from their Belorussian allies.   The US sent their available forces to the Polish frontier, hoping that their deterrent effect would stabilize the situation.<br/><br/>The Ukrainian &quot;Interventionists&quot; (so named for their favorability toward Russian &quot;intervention&quot;) had organized their own fighting force around the two mechanized brigades (and assorted smaller units) that mutinied against the national command.   Russian operatives assisted in arming and organizing the &quot;101 Brigade&quot; from provinces near the border; other partisans throughout the Ukraine also took up arms on the Interventionist side.<br/><br/>The Ukrainian government incorporated their volunteers into the standing army, hoping to avoid any public relations backlash from having irregular forces on the battlefield, as they attempted to paint the conflict as a civil war in which the Russians were meddling and NATO were invited peacekeepers.<br/>The first battles were joined near Lvov, as the Interventionists bypassed Kiev and pushed as far west as possible, hoping to prevent the NATO forces from establishing a bridgehead in the Ukraine. Russian and Belorussian reinforcements arrived from the north to try and flank the existing Ukrainian national forces before NATO could join the fight. The Americans were moving through Poland, but had concerns about the security of their supply lines.<br/><br/>The Next Wars series brings battalion-level modern shooting wars to your tabletop. Combat units must synchronize attacks and defenses to maximize their collective combat power. Headquarters units coordinate actions on the battlefield and support battalions maintain supply lines.<br/><br/>Civilians are a fact of life on the modern battlefield, and they are present in The Next Wars.

Fresh Guards units are spearheading the assault into Western Europe, bending defending NATO forces to their breaking point. It is up to forces of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), to stop the Soviet advance which, if successful could ultimately threaten Britain itself.<br/>This stand-alone expansion to the Award Winning World at War: Eisenbach Gap System, contains everything you need to play right out of the box. A new, fully updated and expanded rulebook covers the entire original World at War rules and adds new rules to expand the on-map action. Included are regulations for bridging units like Soviet MTU-55, improved positions and air power, which was a special scenario rule in Death of the First Panzer (An earlier add-on covering West German forces with an 11x17 map, 40 new scuff-resistant counters, and 6 new scenarios). Now the NATO forces will have improved positions to help them cope with the Soviet onslaught. Air power becomes an official game element, with rules and counters representing American A-10's, Soviet SU-25's, and British Tornado's. Birds that can deal out a massive amount of destruction on the battlefield, and look sexy doing it. At least as sexy as a cardboard chit can look. Also, expanded artillery rules, introduce Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS), and electronic warfare.<br/>In addition a new table brings battlefield chaos effects to the game. War never goes as planned and great leaders must deal with adversity when it happens. So we thought, 'Let's shake things up a bit&quot;. In games with this option, if you draw the &quot;battlefield chaos&quot; counter, a roll is made to see what the gods of war have hefted upon you, your enemy, or both of you. Anything from bad weather, extra support missions, shell-shocked troops, or skillful battle plans, can come your way.<br/><br/>The war is raging on and now it is up to the British and their formidable array of weapons systems to blunt the Soviet spearhead. Chieftain and Challenger tanks, Striker ATGM vehicles, FV-432 APCs, Lynx attack helicopters, Tornado fighter-bombers and others clash headlong with top-of-the-line Soviet Guards units outfitted with T-80 and T-64 tanks, BMP-2 APCs, MTU-55 Bridge layers, SA-13s, Hind E attack helicopters, Su-25 ground attack aircraft and many more. There is only one mission here. Hold the bridges or see Soviet armor on Channel coast. Are you up to the task?<br/><br/>World at War: Blood and Bridges is the latest complete game in the World at War series. It features 352 counters (we just added an extra half sheet of admin counter goodness), a mounted 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map, 12 scenarios, two player-aid cards, dice, and a complete rules set.

Players have to collect 5 hidden types of sea animals and avoid picking up rubbish such as tires and old boots that have been washed up by the tide. But if they do, they will have the opportunity to rid the beach of such litter, which brings its own reward.<br/><br/>For the younger player, the game has a simple environmental message; for the older player it has a gameplay in which a certain amount of skill and memory is involved.<br/><br/>Basic Rules:<br/><br/>Each player has a 'lotto' board, with space for 5 sea animals: a fish, starfish, crab, sea urchin (type thing) and an octopus. The aim is to be the first to collect all 5 of these, from amongst the square tiles that are laid out over the playing area. Players receive the 'beach bag' from which they draw a round token (same idea as dipping into the Scrabble bag that holds the letters). This token has on it a particular fish type or a particular colour on it. The player then chooses a square tile from the playing area whose upside corresponds in colour or fish type to the round token. He/she flips over the square tile to reveal its underside (which is likely to be different). If the underside is a fish that he/she hasn't collected yet, then the player adds it to his 'lotto' board. If the underside shows a pollution, he/she must collect the pollution. Once a player has three, then he/she may remove them from the game and get a 'free dip'.<br/><br/>Memorising the underside of certain tiles definitely helps, but is not essential, meaning that anyone can play from the age of 3 and up, although the game is certainly illustrated with kids in mind.<br/><br/>The game is soon to be available in the UK, costing around &pound;18.

It is a board game 'controlled' by an electronic handset which serves as a randomizer for combat actions. According to the instructions, the computer &quot;has counters, gates, oscillator clock, programming, read out and execute functions. The 'brain' is made of three miniature TTL logic chips containing over 300 transistors, diodes, and many other components giving a vast computing capacity with a wide range of probabilities for conflict purposes.&quot;<br/><br/>In essence, this is a straightforward  hex-map based battle game for up to four players playing individually or as teams. It contains plastic miniatures and a rectangular game board with pre-marked battlefield features. There are no battle cards or other modifiers apart from the handset. The game depends entirely upon the handset to determine the amount of movement and the result of any attack. The handset therefore replaces dice, but serves much the same function. However, players have the freedom to select position, and direction of movement, and the miniatures are marked with values that determine their firing power, and this has a bearing on the result of combat actions (see below).<br/><br/>Each team deploys a regiment of 8 of tanks (slow moving, high fire power) and 4 armoured cars (fast moving, low fire power) in a pre-mapped fictive country on the game board (Kazaldis, Armania, Sarapan and Calderon) separated by marked national borders (which are red) and terrain features such as a river (with bridges), forests, mountains, and buildings. Each country also has a major city marked by a blue border. Inside the blue border several buildings are marked, into which tanks cannot move, meaning they must navigate the city to get to the enemy HQ or get out of their service/repair area and back into combat.<br/><br/>The objective is simple: to win by occupying the opponent or opponents' headquarters by moving a tank (or armoured car) into the HQ space (pre-marked on the board), or by destroying all enemy tanks.<br/><br/>Though the mechanic is therefore a fairly standard hex and counter skirmish, the computer in the handset ultimately drives the game.<br/><br/>The handset consists of six small red bulbs, two buttons and three switches. The lights appear over six icons indicating conditions of movement (the computer determines 'movement points' which may be spent according to terrain features - for example moving through a city costs one movement point per movement but armoured cars moving in open country may move two spaces per movement point), result of firing, repair status and range of attack.<br/><br/>The bulbs have three states - on, off, and flashing, each of which has a different meaning (see below). Of the three switches, one is a power switch. The other two switches determine the conditions of the 'roll' on any given player's turn. One indicates whether the player has opted to attack or retreat (the selection becomes a variable in the computer's calculation of the result), the other on whether the tank is moving or being repaired (tanks under repair cannot move or fire, but if the handset indicates that the service has been successful, the tank can move and fire in that turn).<br/><br/>The handset also has two buttons: one red, one black. The black button is pressed for between 2 and 5 seconds to command the computer to run a computation cycle that will determine movement and repair status (depending on the switches). It will also secretly determine a firing result that will be shown if and when the player presses the 'fire' button (firing is optional).<br/><br/>The red button is for firing. When a player wishes to fire, they press this button and the computer indicates the result of the firing action. If the bulb is fully lit, the result is a hit and the tank with the lower fire power is destroyed. In the case of equal firepower, the attacking tank is considered to have the advantage and destroys the defender. If the bulb flashes, the tank with the lower fire power is damaged and must be placed on a service space for repair. If the bulb stays dark, the attack has failed. According to the instructions &quot;When the computer is programmed for Assault the 'firing result' probability is expressed as a 50% chance of a Hit, 25% chance of Damage and 25% chance of a Miss, while the chance of a 'Service Ready' is 25%. When the computer is programmed for Retreat the 'firing result' probability is expressed as a 25% chance of a Hit, 25% chance of Damage and 50% chance of a Miss, while the chance of 'service ready' is 25%.&quot;<br/><br/>Firing is further complicated by the game board and player actions though. A tank in open country can only fire at an enemy tank in a directly adjacent hex in front of or behind it, and it must turn to face in the direction it wishes to fire. Within city boundaries a tank may fire at an enemy in any hex in contact with the one it occupies, though it must again turn to face the target. Ranged firing (two spaces) is possible in open country, but is again a random result from the handset. A tank which is allowed a ranged attack by the handset may fire across lakes and rivers, but not mountains.<br/><br/>"}, "35161": {"boardgamedesigner": {"979": {"name": "Gary Chalk"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Assault of the Ogroids", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "yearpublished": "1987", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"5666": "Solitaire Games"}, "maxplayers": "1", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic309921_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"8141": {"name": "EMAP Publications Ltd"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic309921.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"319453": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Assault Of The Ogroids is a computer moderated solo board game published in the May 1987 issue of Sinclair User magazine, a computer magazine for the 8-bit SInclair ZX Spectrum.<br/><br/>The player takes the part of Deerfoot, a scout sent to gain aid for his city which is being besieged by the evil Ogroids.

Played with different colored sailing ships and on a beautiful large world map board, the game is set in the year 1806, at the peak of Napoleon's power. The game is played on three levels: the first level is rolling dice and moving one of six cargoes indicated on cargo cards from one port/continent to another, avoiding ever changing bad weather and war zones, lest you sink at sea.<br/><br/>The second level features pirates that every player gets a chance to be, by the pick of specially marked new cargo cards, once your voyage is complete. Pirates need not reveal themselves until they so desire. Poker face is critical to this game. Pirates can attack merchant ships by rolling additional dice. Knowing when to hold and when to attack are critical to success. However, there are also a few Lord Nelsons at sea - the game's police force -  that can Neutralize pirates.<br/><br/>Finally, there is the most exciting third level; the Secret Treasure Islands. With every game there is at least one, truly secret treasure worth 50,000 pounds that makes the game a fun, fast, in your face adventure. Since the location of these treasures changes from game to game, no two games are ever the same and although the better strategists more often than not win this game, no one is ever really out of it. The emotional intensity of the game often increases into a climactic finish.<br/><br/>The Box and Board are beautifully designed, money comes in British pounds (paper), ships are wooden and painted with different colored sails, ship manifests are included to keep record of your payouts, and variously colored lighthouses mark where you start and where you end.

The basic command formation would be (depending on nation/year) a Brigade or Division. Each Brigade/Division has an attached commander, and each side has a CinC stand. Commanders have Leadership ratings which influence initiative and the pace of the game. The overall rating of a formation determines which Decision Die (Activation) it uses, which determines how many units may act, how many auto-rallies you get, etc.<br/>Units are rated by morale, which is the key element of the game. A unit's morale determines which attack die you use, which morale die you use, and how many times it can recover from panicking.<br/><br/>Fire Combat: The attacker must make an opposed die roll to hit and damage its target. The attacker rolls a die based upon its morale grade, so a Militia unit roles a d6 while an Elite unit roles a d12 to hit. The defender rolls a Cover Die based upon covering terrain; open (d4), light cover (d6), type of tank (light, Med. Heavy) etc. The difference determines how many disorder markers the target takes, and can force a Panic Check.<br/><br/>Attached companies provide fire support, and special units are important in the game. A unit can have up to four attached companies that provide Fire Die bonuses, help recover Disorder markers, etc. Example, a Battalion with an attached HMG company (+2), Mortar Company (+1), AA Company and Medical Company would get a +3 on its Fire Die, force attacking aircraft to make a Morale Check to press a ground attack, and automatically remove one Disorder Marker per turn.<br/><br/>The rules are fairly comprehensive and cover all the basics of the period -- air superiority over the battlefield, ground attack, artillery, smoke, amphibious landings, fortifications, mines, engineers, supply, paratroopers, gliders, etc.<br/><br/>Also included is a set of rules on generating battles and battlefield terrain, basic army lists, equipment lists, and some sample battles and campaigns.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Panzer Korps Campaigns<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "35188": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1599343.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"200220": "Killer of Pirates"}, "is_expanded_by": {"88415": {"name": "San Guo Sha: Battle"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"48762": {"name": "KayaK"}}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamecompilation": {"140065": "San Guo Sha: Complete Edition"}, "yearpublished": "2007", "maxplayers": "10", "boardgameartist": {"48762": "KayaK"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"27313": {"name": "Phantasia"}}, "maxplaytime": "40", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1599343_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "40", "boardgamecategory": {"1050": {"name": "Ancient"}}, "description": "Publisher blurb (Yoka Games English Edition):<br/><br/>Throughout the rich history of ancient China, the Three Kingdoms has always been a chaotic and awe-inspiring time period.

Combining these heroes with role play, battle, deception, and other elements, we created a fun and exciting game that can be shared with many.  We hope you will have as much fun playing as we had bringing this game to you.<br/><br/>Legends of the Three Kingdoms (a.k.a. San Guo Sha) is a card game based off the Chinese classical novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and shares many rules with BANG!. The differences are as follows:<br/>1. The Monarch (Sheriff) may get an additional skill related to their kingdom allegiance; players routinely have two powers.<br/>2. Weapons may have their own additional powers.<br/>3. A card to let a player borrow a weapon from another.<br/>4. A card to cancel the effect of other cards.<br/>5. Peach (Beer) may be played by any player when someone loses their last life; there is no exemption of using Peach when there are only 2 players left.<br/>6. The game proceeds counter-clockwise.<br/>7.

The failure of the coup as it had been originally planned gave way to a civil conflict between the defenders of the democratic government and the backers of the military coup. Machado&rsquo;s two Spain's fought each other for nearly three years in a battle which reflected the political and social tensions affecting the world at that time.<br/><br/>The opposing armies were very different: on one hand, the Republican army possessed a limited number of professional soldiers and many popular militias belonging to political parties and labor unions. To this were added the International Brigades, formed from foreign volunteers of diverse origin; a fighting force which was highly motivated, but poorly coordinated and typically poorly organized. On the other hand, the Franco&acute;s army had most of the professional military, along with Carlist and fascist militias, many native Moroccan troops, and the volunteers of the Condor Legion and the Corpo Trupe Voluntarie, sent by Hitler and Mussolini, respectively.<br/><br/>From a military point of view, the Spanish Civil War presaged the global conflict which would soon erupt. In the mid-1930s, military high commands from all over the globe theorized on the possibilities of motorized armies and &ldquo;lightning war&rdquo;. Both Nazis and Soviets rehearsed armored tactics in Spain, and tested various types of weapons. In addition, the importance that air superiority would have on all later conflicts was made clear.

During play, you move your mecha's miniature around an un-gridded playing area, attacking and being attacked by your opponent(s).<br/><br/>Here's the big gimmick: You have a special card for your mecha.  This card is called a template.  Your template keeps track of your health.  It also keeps track of which one of 5 modes you're in.  Your mode dictates your attack, defense, energy, movement, and the range of your ranged attacks.  During play, you'll shift from mode to mode as your needs change.  As you take damage, modes will &quot;shut down&quot; and become unavailable to you.  You win the game by dealing enough damage to your opponent(s) to shut down all of their modes.<br/><br/>Here's the small gimmick: There are no dice.  During play, you'll spend energy to attack and defend.  To do this, you hide energy tokens in your hands and your opponent gets to pick a hand.  The number of tokens in the selected hand determines how strong your attack or defense is.  All tokens in both hands get spent.

If the hit was unsuccessful (for example the ball is possibly out of bounce) an action/outcome card is drafted and the resulting action/outcome is taken (actions/outcomes are based on the rules of golf). A pion marks the place of the ball.<br/><br/>There are 9 boards for 9 holes, and the small game/putting is simulated on a separate board. The players can use their own golf statistics to make up their own tables for use in the game. All variants of golf can be played (stableford, strokeplay, matchplay, foursome, fourball, skins)<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.masterofgolf.nl/' rel='nofollow'>http://www.masterofgolf.nl/</a><br/><br/>"}, "35300": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Mob Boss", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "2002", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic315323_t.jpg", "average": "0", "boardgamepublisher": {"8177": {"name": "Knight Games, Inc."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic315323.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"280425": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "poll": {}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A simple roll and move game, where the objective is to be the first to be &quot;The Boss&quot;.

The numerous tactical choices, combined with a limited military force and the unexpected appearance of Ares on the battlefield, give the game its strategic component. The relatively simple game mechanics make it easy to learn and play, even if you aren't a tactical genius.<br/><br/>Backstory<br/>&quot;In the kingdom of immortals, the restless gods decree that mortal man will fight one another to prove their loyalty. By order of Zeus, The war god Ares leaves his throne to inform man of this noble contest. To the victors go the spoils of war and eternal gratitude from the gods.<br/><br/>As the general of battle hardened archers, infantry, and other units, you have been commissioned by the high priests to lead your people to victory. When the sisters of fate look favorably upon you, your armies will find strategic advantage on the battlefield. Ambush, flank and surround your opponent's forces in an effort to gain the upper hand.  If the battle looks bleak, call on your mercenary forces to turn the tide.&quot;<br/><br/>Game Overview<br/>The idea behind Battlefields of Olympus is to secure a number of Land Trophy cards through battle using Warrior cards and Action cards. The one with the most valuable lands by the end of the game is victor. Battlefields of Olympus is a tug of war, where each player must decide when to use his forces to fight and when it is better to retreat and gather strength for later battles.<br/><br/>There is also an element of press your luck as the appearance of Ares and the order that land turns up during the game is randomly predetermined. On the other hand, when there is a stack of face-up Land Trophy cards, strategic planning is paramount, as players must decide when it is better to concede a battle in favor of a more valuable Land Trophy card farther down in the stack.<br/><br/>Each player commands a legion of up to 4 Warrior cards, but there is often a reserve pile of Warrior cards to draw from at the end of battle. Players need to decide when it is better to keep more powerful Warriors in hand and when it is better to retire the weaker ones from their reserve pile. The limit of 4 Action cards in hand forces players to manage what actions they need most.<br/><br/>The optional fortify and sacrifice rules create more tension as players have additional tough decisions to make. Using the Fortify action will protect your land, but at the risk of temporarily weakening the size of your military force in hand. Do you sacrifice a piece of hard-fought land in favor of your opponent's more valuable property, or do you wait until a valuable Land Trophy card turns up on the land pile.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"28681": "First Edition"}, "average": "6.18396", "name": "Battlefields of Olympus", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2018": "Campaign / Battle Card Driven"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "134", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"10640": "Country: Greece"}}, "35307": {"boardgameversion": {"270867": "First Edition"}, "boardgamedesigner": {"5179": {"name": "Bob Gang"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Adsubmuldi", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1971", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2476962_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"765": {"name": "Educational Insights"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2476962.jpg", "boardgamefamily": {"96": "Checkers"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Adsubmuldi is a self-described checkers variant utilizing pieces with numerals on the undersides of the pieces.

If one die shows a multiplication problem, the player has to solve it. If both dice show a multiplication problem, the player can choose which one to solve. If both dice show a number instead of a multiplication, the player repeats the throw. If the player correctly solves the problem (the other players can check on the opposite side of the die), he/she passes the die on to the next player, who uses it to start building an &quot;obelisk&quot; (by stacking one die onto the next). If the active player cannot solve the multiplication, he/she has to start building the obelisk. Then it is the next player's turn. Each turn, another die is added to the obelisk, either by the following player (if the active player correctly solves the problem), or by the active player (if their answer is incorrect). <br/>The game ends when the obelisk collapses. The last player who managed to stack a die onto the obelisk without collapsing it wins the game. If the players manage to stack all dice before the obelisk collapses, they all win together.<br/><br/>2) The multiplication pyramid<br/>The aim of this variant is to be the first to complete a pyramid.<br/>The dice are evenly distributed among all the players. Players take turns throwing two of their dice. If one die shows a multiplication problem, the player has to solve it. If both dice show a multiplication problem, the player can choose which one to solve. If both dice show a number instead of a multiplication or if the active player can't solve the multiplication, they lose their turn. If they correctly solve the problem, they use the die to start building a pyramid (by stacking dice).

He/she then has a look at the results (without the other players looking) and puts them back. They then say one of the results, and all the other players try to grab the die with the multiplication that fits this result. The player who grabs the correct die earns this die.

In an atmosphere of pessimism and charged paranoia, the citizens of Salem are at the mercy of demons &ndash; not demons of the soul, but demons of the mind. What began as a devout Puritan community devolved in a matter of months into a people torn apart by fear, lies, and fanatical orthodoxy. The residents of Salem quickly discovered that they could find Hell all around them.<br/><br/>Salem incites the atmosphere of paranoia that held the village of Salem captive. Players act with the assumption that there are witches among them (and, in this case, there will be). Each player controls six residents of Salem, three of whom are witches. Game play is simple: try to rid the village of witches and keep the identities of your own residents secret.<br/><br/>The game plays over the course of four rounds representing the four months (June&ndash;September 1692) in which the hysteria was at its height. Each round has two parts: a Witch Hunt and a Witch Trial, followed by hangings (the dates of which correspond to the four actual hangings that took place in Salem that year). During the Witch Hunt, players send residents to jail and provide alibis for their own jailed citizens. At the end of each round all jailed citizens stand trial. Players then collectively decide who is hanged and who is spared. The player who is most successful at discerning witches from villagers wins!<br/><br/>While the story surrounding the Salem witch trials has become something of a legend, every character in this game is based on a real person whose life was directly touched and in some cases torn apart or taken away by the events surrounding the Salem witch trials. Extensive research has been done to craft the real-life stories of all 42 residents in the game.<br/><br/>While this game focuses on the people and events specific to Salem, Massachusetts, similar witch hunts were taking place as far north as Maine and as far West as Connecticut.

Based on the popular World at War, NAW depicts platoon level combat in World War II. Here you&rsquo;ll find everything you're looking for in a platoon-level game -- armor, artillery, infantry that serves as more than cannon fodder, command and control, air support, amphibious landings, and desperate close assaults that leave the victor in possession of the ground and the defeated in headlong retreat, all in eight pages of rules. That&rsquo;s two less than the World at War system.<br/><br/>Units represent platoons of vehicles, such as M-10 Wolverines, M4A3E8 Easy Eight Shermans, and German Panthers, Tigers, and Mark IVs. Of course White Star Rising isn&rsquo;t all about tanks. There&rsquo;s plenty of infantry; paratroopers, line doggies, Fallschirmjaeger, and Volksgrenadiers. In the same vein as the World at War system, the infantry are capable of moving fast and hitting hard. White Star Rising also includes support weapons, such as heavy machine guns, flamethrowers, and satchel charges that infantry platoons can use to lethal effect.<br/><br/>The system throws typical turn-based gaming out the window. The platoons are grouped into formations (usually battalions and kampfgruppen) and led by a headquarters. Each unit of the formation must be within range of the HQ to activate with its formation. Although individual units might activate, and recon units can double their range from the HQ, you&rsquo;ll want to keep those formations together. The formations are activated by chit draw, and better-trained, better-led units can activate more than once in a turn, moving, shooting, and fighting in each activation. On the flip side, there is no guarantee that a formation will activate even once. The cup into which the formation chits are placed is seeded with end turn chits. When the second end turn chit is drawn the turn ends. Doesn&rsquo;t matter if a single formations has activated; the turn is over. It keeps you on your toes.<br/><br/>When attacking, each platoon rolls a number of dice equal to its firepower. Every die that equals or exceeds the &ldquo;to hit&rdquo; number (right superscript) hits the target. The target then rolls a number of dice equal to its armor factor plus terrain advantages. Each die that equals or exceeds its armor factor negates a hit. The first hit disrupts a unit, second reduces it, the third eliminates it.<br/><br/>Units may also close assault, entering the opponent&rsquo;s hex to either deal a death blow or force him (or her) out of valuable terrain. Same procedure, but both units use their close assault value. The side that takes the most hits must retreat from the hex. Infantry is VERY good at this, especially against armor without its own infantry support.<br/><br/>Game includes rules for thin-skinned vehicles, support weapons (actual counters that represent heavy machine guns, flamethrowers, and satchel charges that add to an infantry platoon&rsquo;s capabilities), air support, bunkers, wire, artillery, mines, overruns opportunity fire, line-of-sight rules that have been streamlined since their inception in World at War, transporting infantry--and all in eight pages of rules.<br/><br/>Contents<br/><br/>    2 sheets (approximate 200 total) .75&quot; counters<br/>    4 professionally-drawn, printed, 11&quot; x 17&quot;  geomorphic maps<br/>    18 scenarios<br/>    2 players' aid cards<br/>    4 dice <br/>    20 page full color rule, scenario, and chart book.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Other Games in Series:<br/><br/>    Nations at War: White Star Rising<br/>    Nations at War: Desert Heat<br/>    Nations at War: Stalin's Triumph<br/>    White Star Rising: Airborne<br/>    White Star Rising: Operation Cobra<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    World at War: Eisenbach Gap<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"81395": "English First edition"}, "boardgame": {"140251": "Line of Fire #12"}, "average": "7.41482", "name": "Nations at War: White Star Rising", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2057": "Chit-Pull System"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "226", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"9809": "Nations at War Series"}}, "35401": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2422128.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"11046": {"name": "Flavio Jandorno"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"43899": "Marcelo Bissoli"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"10737": {"name": "Brinquedos Toia"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2422128_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"21716": "2012 JoTa Best Game Released in Brazil Nominee"}, "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Gal&aacute;xia S.A. is an exciting game where player will build an intergalactic economical empire!

Here, the battlefield is an extension of the political arena. Many historical movers and shakers support or oppose their presidents&rsquo; war plans. Will Mr. Lincoln save the Union? Will Mr. Davis succeed in sundering one nation and creating another? How will you direct their political support?<br/><br/>Lincoln&rsquo;s War is a card-driven game using cards to activate generals, but in Lincoln&rsquo;s War, activation numbers are also political currency or PC. PC not only activates generals but promotes worthy commanders, purchases war material, forces indecisive commanders to act, and represents support for the war. A decisive PC point spread is an advantage in winning the game but driving an opponent to 0 PC (and 0 Congressional support) at the end of a turn will ensure victory, even in the face of defeat.<br/><br/>Unique features include a diceless combat system, seditious characters, and immobilization tokens. The combat system requires players to husband resources and congressional political support to ensure victory. Seditious characters oppose their respective Presidents&rsquo; handling of the war and sooner or later will erode a resident&rsquo;s vital political support. Immobilization tokens reflect damage in the form of casualties, as well as hesitation, confusion and even insubordination.<br/><br/>Lincoln&rsquo;s War contains:<br/>    1 22&quot; x 34&quot; map<br/>    1 color rulebook<br/>    1 color play and background booklet<br/>    162 Operations Cards<br/>    2 countersheets<br/>    2 player aid cards<br/><br/>Lincoln&rsquo;s War was designed by John Poniske with the assistance of Mike Joslyn, and features the artwork of Niko Eskubi and map artwork by Mark Mahaffey.<br/><br/>(source: MMP website)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"190615": "First edition"}, "average": "6.65179", "name": "Lincoln's War", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2018": "Campaign / Battle Card Driven"}, "age": "0", "usersrated": "84", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "35453": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic925900.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"224648": {"name": "Strafexpedition 1916: Valsugana Map"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"10400": {"name": "Andrea Brusati"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"66320": "Alberto Cavazzuti"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5442": {"name": "Europa Simulazioni"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic925900_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "description": "(from Europa Simulazioni website:)<br/><br/>Strafexpedition 1916, using battalion level units, comes with a brand-new impulse system, which allows a remarkable level of interaction between the two players.

This is a two-player operational level game depicting the battles in the Crimean peninsula of the Soviet Union during 1941 and 1942. Beginning in mid-October 1941 and ending in January 1942, it completes the year 1941 in this series of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. And it includes 1942 scenarios of the continued fighting in Crimea until the historical fall of the great Soviet naval fortress Sevastopol in July 1942.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/>One 22x34 inch map<br/>840 counters<br/>Rule booklet in color<br/>Playbook in color<br/>Various player aid cards for charts and tables in color<br/>Set up cards for each scenario in color<br/>4 Scenario cards 11x17<br/>1 ten sided die<br/><br/>THE GAME<br/><br/>This comprehensive game system was designed at a scale for divisions but it accommodates the many independent brigades, regiments, and special battalions that were also available for this campaign. These include units for rocket artillery, heavy artillery, armored trains, assault guns, engineers, Stukas, Sturmoviks, anti-aircraft guns, waffen SS, NKVD, militia, base units, naval units, and more. You have reinforcement options to tailor your army to fight a full campaign with many historical variables.<br/><br/>As we have indicated with each game, all games in this series share the same game mechanics. Veteran East Front Series (EFS) players will find much here that is familiar. Such mechanics include ranged artillery, air units for close support or interdiction, Soviet HQs, retreat or stand orders, weather, reaction movement, railroad movement, strategic movement, overruns, combined arms, fortifications, special supply situations, and more. Veteran players should be able to pick up game play right away, and for them we have clarified many game procedures. For those who are new to the series, examples of play will be found in the rules book as well as a Learning scenario to fully illustrate game play and some of the decision making for each battle.<br/><br/>All games of the EFS series are built to fit together side-by-side for possible combined play. We recognize that space is at a premium for some of you, so consider that all of the eight scenarios in this game require only one map or less; yes, just one map! Newcomers should try this game as a sample of the whole series.<br/><br/>Barbarossa: Crimea includes several special features not found with all EFS games. Since the game revolves around Sevastopol, we include a special inset map to depict in detail the fighting at that important naval fortress. Much gaming will directly involve the inset, so we have streamlined previous series rules dealing with an inset map. We have also streamlined the naval rules, effectively rebuilding them. This in turn allowed us to rebuild the Odessa scenario found with the Barbarossa: Army Group South game in this series. There, and later in Crimea, the Soviets used amphibious operations to move battle lines forward. If an amphibious operation is not going well, the Soviets could declare an Evacuation. At Sevastopol the German player will be using his super-heavy artillery, including the world&rsquo;s largest artillery piece, Dora, historically seen in the final game scenario. The design notes include an essay on these wonder-weapons.<br/><br/>Barbarossa: Crimea challenges you to balance your attack and defense in each sector of the game map, regardless of scenario. Neither side has sufficient resources in either troops or supplies so the key to winning will be good game play and a sound plan. Can you do better than the titans that struggled for the Ukraine in the summer and fall of 1941?<br/><br/>THE SCENARIOS<br/><br/>1) Learning Scenario: The Tartar Ditch. The German 11th Army has just received orders to enter the Crimea but to do so it must first clear the narrow Perekop Isthmus. This was the first battle for the Crimea. This is a small scenario but it teaches important lessons in precise game unit positioning - exactly what one would expect for historical positional warfare.<br/><br/>2) Odessa: Hero City. This is a bloody example of siege warfare. The Romanian army shows exactly why it was so ill-suited for such an offensive, while the Soviets struggle to balance their forces from sector-to-sector and endure delays of reinforcements coming by sea. This rebuilds the scenario found in theArmy Group South game using new research and this game&rsquo;s improved naval rules.<br/><br/>3) Crimea: The Road to Sevastopol. This begins in mid October 1941. The Germans almost certainly will break through the main Soviet defense line, so the Soviet player has to know when to break away from the action and run back to fresh prepared positions, a tactic typical of game play in other series games. The German player also chooses secret victory conditions. He will either drive south to Sevastopol or southeast to Kerch, forcing the Soviet to balance his defense of both.<br/><br/>4) Sevastopol: The First Battle. With the Germans committed to Sevastopol, can the Soviet divert enough German attention elsewhere to save the fortress? In the meantime, the deeper the German pushes into the Sevastopol inset map, the better his chances for long-term victory.<br/><br/>5) Crimean Campaign. The campaign scenario puts scenarios 3 and 4 together to feature a punch and counter-punch game strategy. The Soviet player relies on his naval units to rapidly shift the threat. The German relies on his infantry to consolidate gains.<br/><br/>6) Kerch: The Party Boss Attack. Ever wonder why Mandated Attacks exist in this game system? In the middle of winter 1942 one of Stalin&rsquo;s cronies thought the armies holding the Kerch Peninsula in the Crimea were not sufficiently motivated to defeat the fascists. He personally bullied the local Front commander into do-or-die attacks. This scenario exemplifies the insanity of political expectations trumping battlefield realities. Can you find a weakness in the Axis line?<br/><br/>7) Kerch: Operation Trappenjagd. Now it is the German turn to attack in the Kerch Peninsula but their champion knows how to attack. This is a brilliantly planned German attack, one that pays handsome dividends. Can you repeat Manstein&rsquo;s success? As the Soviet can you defeat Manstein&rsquo;s attack?<br/><br/>8) Sevastopol: Operation Storfang. This is the last picture show in the Crimea and it will be bloody. Truly, the best is saved for the last as the Soviets fight for every last hill, fort, and farmhouse. They went down fighting and their sacrifice earned them great honor in the history books. It was close. The German plan of offensive was sound and it met each challenge the Soviets posed. Can you duplicate Manstein&rsquo;s cold calculations and earn your marshal&rsquo;s baton?<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"78526": "First printing"}, "average": "7.862", "name": "Barbarossa: Crimea", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "0", "usersrated": "100", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"116": "GMT East Front Series"}}, "35477": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic513065.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"10361": "Dead of Winter (first edition)"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"135": {"name": "Richard H.

Perhaps one of the most evenly matched battles of the war, Murfreesboro/Stone&rsquo;s River pitted the Federal Army of the Cumberland under Major General William Starke Rosecrans against the Confederate Army of Tennessee captained by General Braxton Bragg. With near parity of numbers (each side fielded roughly 40,000 men) and remarkably similar battle plans, both armies grappled in the December cold for control of Middle Tennessee.<br/><br/>The Series:<br/><br/>The GBACW Series is one of the hobby&rsquo;s longest lived design concepts, springing from the legendary regimental Level Gettysburg game - Terrible Swift Sword - created by Richard Berg in 1976. Since then, the series has undergone numerous system evolutions, always seeking to enhance the player&rsquo;s illusion of reality. Today, the series relies on inter-active chit-pull mechanics to simulate the sometimes chaotic nature of the 19th Century battlefield. GMT's Red Badge Of Courage and Gringo! Are the two most recent releases in this classic line of games.<br/><br/>The Game:<br/>Dead of Winter II completely revisits this battle. The old version needed a face-lift. The biggest change is in returning the ground scale to 110 yards per hex.  While going to the larger scale means an increase in maps, the added elbow room allows for much more historical unit frontages and more playable stacking.<br/> One Introductory and ten regular scenarios examine every aspect of the historical battle and present the players with several plausible alternative situations based on events leading up to the actual engagement. Scenario sizes range from one-half of one map and an hour to play, to all four maps and many enjoyable gaming hours. Also included are a number of optional forces that could have plausibly been brought into the fight; Keep your opponent guessing as to what he will face next with this interesting range of options.<br/><br/>The Team: <br/>While Richard Berg remains the final authority for all things GBACW, and John Alsen continues his invaluable role in the development of each title, Dead of Winter II adds one more well-known gaming name to the mix: Designer Dave Powell. Dave has designed more than a dozen civil war simulation games with The Gamers, Inc, (now owned by MMP.) Dave has always loved the GBACW since the moment he first opened the box for TSS, and welcomed the chance to bring his design talents and historical skills to the Dead of Winter project.<br/><br/><br/>Game Design: Dave Powell<br/>Series Design: Richard H.

There are 6 colored monk pieces, a Williams piece, and an Anson piece, all set up in different locations at the start. All monks start with 10 suspicion points and 5 clue points. Players are each randomly assigned one monk color (keep secret!). Each player receives 3 cards (which show either a monk, a location, or Williams/Anson).<br/><br/>There are 7 rounds (days), each with 24 hours. Each day starts by revealing a random event tile in effect for that day. Then, players take turns playing cards: monk card = move that monk to a different location; location card = move any piece to that location; Williams/Anson card = move either of those pieces to any other location. Cards also have a number (0-5): add as many hours to the clock, unless you spend previously collected chits to reduce the number (by 1 per chit spent) -- spent chits added to the line of chits next to the board. If you move past 2400 hours, the day ends. Draw a card at the end of your turn.<br/><br/>When a monk is moved to a location, if there is no piece of their color, increase their suspicion by the sum of (both) chits present. If there is, take that chit and reduce the monk's suspicion score by the number on that chit. If it was the last chit, add 2 chits from the line next to the board.<br/><br/>If Williams moves to a location, add/subtract 3 from each of the clue scores for all monks present there. For Anson, it's +/- 5 suspicion points.<br/><br/>When the day ends, that player takes the event tile (=2 clue points against their monk at end of game). Convert suspicion points to clue points by ranking most to least (5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 clue points); ties &quot;generous&quot;. Reset suspicion points to 10 for all monks.<br/><br/>After days 1, 3, and 5 players reveal one color they are NOT.<br/><br/>Day 7 is different: players simultaneously guess which monk other players were assigned. For every correct guess, that player's monk receives (substantial) additional clue points (number of points varies based on number of players).<br/><br/>The player with the fewest clue points against their monk wins the game!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"27421": "Ravensburger German edition"}, "average": "6.77119", "name": "The Name of the Rose", "playingtime": "75", "boardgamemechanic": {"2016": "Secret Unit Deployment"}, "age": "0", "usersrated": "1222", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}}, "35489": {"boardgamedesigner": {"10410": {"name": "Barry J.
