Before the next card is revealed, you have the chance to leave the mine and stash your holdings, including any gems you get on the way out.<br/><br/>Why would you leave? Because the deck also contains hazards: scorpions, snakes, poison gas, explosions and rockfalls. When a particular hazard is revealed for the second time (e.g., a second scorpion), anyone still in the shaft or on the path has to drop all the gems they've collected that round and flee for safety. The trick is that as more players leave each turn, your share of the pie grows larger, which will perhaps inspire you to explore deeper &mdash; but at the risk of ending up with nothing.<br/><br/>All editions of Incan Gold and later editions of Diamant include five artifact cards that are shuffled into the deck of gem and hazard cards, either one per round or all at once. When an artifact card is revealed, no on can take this card and it's placed on the path.

Others say it derives from a Chinese game in which player try to move 36 statues into a magic circle. <br/> The Roulette layout that we know today first appeared in 1765 in Paris, but the modern version of the game did not appear until around 1842 when Frenchmen Francois and Louis Blanc are said to have invented the single &quot;0&quot; roulette game. Another mystic legend tells that Francois Blanc, who founded the first casinos in Monte Carlo, sold a soul to the devil for the secret of roulette. As proof, they point out that the sum of all the numbers on a Roulette wheel added together total 666 - the number of the beast.<br/> The single &quot;0&quot; wheel became known as the &quot;French Wheel&quot;. When French immigrants brought the game to America a double zero &quot;00&quot; was also added and this became known as the &quot;American Wheel&quot;. The game became popular in the old west of America during the California Gold Rush.<br/><br/>Modern Roulette is a perfectly balanced wheel with a slot for each number. The numbers alternate between black and red (the 0 and 00 are green) and exactly opposite each other number is the corresponding higher and lower number (0 is opposite the 00, 1 is opposite the 2, and so on up to the 35 being directly opposite the 36). Players may place a multitude of wagers: Single Number pays 35:1, Two Numbers pays 17:1, Three numbers pays 11:1, Four Numbers pays 8:1, Five Numbers (American Wheel) pays 6:1, Six Numbers pays 5:1, Column or Dozen pays 2:1, High/Low Black/Red or Odd/Even pays 1:1. The 0 and 00 are not counted when calculating the odds which gives the house its edge. Ironically, no matter where you place your chips, the house edge remains almost constant (5.26% American Wheel, 2.70% French Wheel).<br/><br/>When all the bets are placed the croupier rolls a little ivory ball along the inner edge of the wheel in the opposite direction of its spin. As the wheel turns, the ball loses momentum, bounces among the slots and finally falls into one of the numbered slots. The number that the ball rests on is the declared as the winning number for that game and winning wagers are paid off. <br/> ", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Bar-Zim Aerial Table View Edition", "Bar-Zim White Edition", "Bell Edition", "Berwick Bright Red Second Edition", "Berwick Red Edition", "Blue & Red Box Edition", "Carreras Turf Cigarettes Edition", "Cathay Edition", "Chad Valley British Edition", "Chad Valley Tin-Plate Edition", "Dal Negro Italian White Edition", "dan-spil Danish Edition", "E.S.

Each part has a number from 1-6 and the roll of a die decides which kind of body part you can take from the pool. The goal is then to complete as many clowns as possible.<br/><br/>Jumbolino is representative of a whole class of children's games where players roll a die and add a puzzle piece to their board for the number on the die roll. Similar to Cootie, except that Cootie requires you to get multiples of some numbers (6 ea. of 6 for the legs, and 2 ea. of 4 and 3 for eyes and antennae).<br/><br/>It's also similar to The Merry Game of Floundering, with some differences. In The Merry Game of Floundering:<br/>1. The Flounders have to be assembled in order. Body part 1 first, two next and so on.<br/>2. All the Flounders are put in the middle at the start.<br/>3. Flounders are not owned by players, they remain in the center even if fully assembled.<br/>4. Two dice are thrown for assembly. A player may use either number rolled to add a Flounder part. If both numbers relate to started Flounders, then both numbers can be used.<br/>5. A double thrown grants an extra turn.<br/>6. When a 6 and a 1 are thrown, the player may take a complete Flounder from the center and if there are none in the center that player may take a complete Flounder from another player.<br/>7. When all the Flounders are complete and owned, the player with the most wins. If they are tied, they throw the dice to decide the winner.<br/><br/>Similar to Safari Builders, but Safari Builders is listed as 1-4 players.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Clementoni British edition 2007", "Discovery Toys edition 1988", "Gabriel edition 1975", "Jumbo clown multilingual edition", "Jumbo Disney edition", "Jumbo Dutch edition 1978", "Jumbo edition", "Jumbo Edition", "Jumbo edition 2003", "Jumbo Lion King edition", "Jumbo Pocahontas Edition", "Jumbo Sesame Street edition", "Jumbo Sesamstraat edition", "Kids Commotions Saint Nicolas Edition", "Kids Commotions Special Saint-Nicolas edition", "King edition 1990", "Klee Purple Surround Edition", "Kohner edition", "Kosmos German edition", "Merit First Edition", "Ravensburger German first edition 1983", "Ravensburger German second edition 1994", "Ravensburger Multilingual edition 2004", "Ravensburger Multilingual edition 2010", "Sala German first edition", "Schmidt German edition", "Schmidt German first edition", "Schmidt German Light Blue edition", "Schmidt German Tin Box edition 2008", "Selecta Dutch edition", "Spear's German first edition", "Spear's German first edition", "University Games Edition", "Waddingtons edition 1975"], "average": "3.875", "name": "Jumbolino", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Pattern Recognition"], "age": "4", "usersrated": "50", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Children's Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Elephants", "Animals: Fishes", "Animals: Ladybugs", "Animals: Mice", "Animals: Pigs", "Celebrities: Pocahontas", "Celebrities: Walt Disney", "Characters: Benjamin the Elephant", "TV Series: Sesame Street"]}, "15600": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1774644.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Stefan Dorra"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2005", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Rotraud Meiler"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Goldsieber Spiele"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1774644_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Medieval"], "boardgamehonor": ["2005 Japan Boardgame Prize Best Advanced Game Nominee"], "description": "Players use different character cards to bring in and move pieces around Kreta which give them influence in the provinces on the island. One of the cards triggers scoring in all the provinces adjacent to a place, and each province gives various Victory Points (VPs) to the 1st and 2nd most influence. At any time, you only know the next two places that will score, so if you cannot gain influence the current place, you can prepare for the next scoring.<br/><br/>Each player has an identical set of characters, and each character controls certain pieces which have different abilities and limitations in the game. By smart use of your characters and clever timing, you can try to have the scoring occur when you have the most influence, and gain more VPs than the other players.<br/><br/>But influence changes swiftly, the others can quickly conspire to block your control, and the scoring places can jump from one end of the island to the other, leaving you controlling worthless provinces. Can you make the right choices to gain influence in the right place at the right time, or will you be left watching as someone else takes power in Kreta?<br/><br/>From the publisher, Goldsieber: &quot;Settle the most important Cretan provinces with your followers.

In return you'll gain a deeper understanding of how others see you.<br/><br/>This boardgame (without a board!) works like this: an Analyst asks questions about a randomly-drawn subject. The Trainee Analysts must provide insightful but not obvious answers about the subject's character. The Analyst must then guess who the subject is. Points are awarded and we move to the next round. Simple ... and fun!<br/><br/>The techniques used in this game are used by therapists and advertising agencies when they want to gain a deeper understanding of people, why they do things and what really drives them. For example during the Bush / Gore election campaign, planning departments in advertising agencies asked people if the presidential candidates came to life as cars, what kind of car would they be? George Bush was seen as a Maserati, Al Gore was a Honda Accord. I'll leave it to you to draw your own conclusions as to why!<br/>(Taken Directly from the webpage)<br/><br/>"}, "15621": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Paulo Renato Dias"], "poll": [], "name": "Lupus", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement"], "yearpublished": "1990", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic64829_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic64829.jpg", "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Puzzle"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "The objective of this Games is to move your color pieces into other players territory.

Each player places their Sama-stone on the second hole from their baseline. Both players also get 13 stones in their color, and 2  joker-stones. All these stones are kept hidden behind the player's screens.<br/><br/>Every turn each player secretly selects 0 to 3 regular stones, or a joker-stone. These are then simultaneously revealed, the Sama-stone of the player with the winning selection moves one place towards the opponent's side, and the stone-selection of both players are removed from play.<br/><br/>If both players reveal the same stone-selection, then these stones are still removed from play, but neither Sama-stone gets moved forwards. If a player runs out of stones then the opponent's Sama-stone moves 1 space forwards for each regular stone still in this player's reserve.<br/><br/>So what makes a winning selection? A selection of regular stones gets beaten by a higher amount of regular stones. A joker-stone beats any amount of regular stones. However, if a joker-stone is played when the opponent decided to play no stones at all, than it in turn is beaten.<br/><br/>Play continues until one player reaches the opposite side of the board, or until a player runs out of stones to play.

However, if a fumble occurs during the down-stacking process, you may continue to down stack without having to rebuild the pyramid.

Players have escaped the modern-day zombie hoard only to find themselves transported back in time and faced with a whole new set of problems!<br/><br/>Game play is fairly straightforward.  Players start at the well and their objective is either to kill 25 points worth of skeletons or to collect the Necromicon from the graveyard and return with it to the Altar.  The various skeletons are worth different points, White are worth 1, Red are worth 2, and Blue are worth 3.<br/><br/>Players start by drawing a tile and placing it on the board anywhere it will fit.  They then place a number of skeletons and villagers as shown on the tile.  They then roll a six-sided die (d6) for movement.  Movement is orthogonal and limited to the tiles currently in play.  If you encounter a villager you can collect it; skeletons you encounter must be overcome.  At the end of your turn you again roll the d6 to move that many skeletons 1 space each.<br/><br/>Players can collect up to 5 villagers who can be sacrificed if they lose a fight.  Combat is simple - enter a square with a skeleton and on a 4 or better on a d6, you win.  If the roll is less than 4, you can either sacrifice a villager or pay skeletons to reach 4 or better.  There is no change, so if you roll a 3 and only have reds, you now have a 5.<br/><br/>Some of the cards also require specific colors of skeletons be used in order to power them and many require that you kill skeletons in order to play them.<br/><br/>Once a player reaches the Graveyard and grabs the Necronomicon, the other players can attack him during their turns to try to steal it away from him.  The game ends when someone takes the Necronomicon to the center tile of the Altar or collects 25 points worth of skeletons.<br/><br/>This Zombies!!! sized box contains 30 map tiles, 50 event cards,  6 pawns, 50 sculpted life counters (little gray dudes), rules and 100 HEAVILY ARMED AND ANGRY SKELETON WARRIORS!!!

Rummy 500 is the most commonly played form of Rummy. Rummy 500 is a standard deck playing card game using 52 cards.  It is one of the most popular family card games, and has a simple premise.  Players are dealt a hand of cards, with the goal being to rid yourself of all the cards in your hand.  You can do this by playing cards to the table, in groups of three, either in sets (groups of cards with the same value from different suits) or in runs (three or more consecutive cards for one suit).  Once a person lays down a group of cards, other players -- including the player who played the original set -- can now &quot;lay off&quot; cards to that group.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they can take the top face down card from the stock, or take the top face up card from the discard pile.  After melding, laying off, or making no plays on the table, a player must discard a card face up on the discard pile. The discard pile is spread out, so that the value of all cards is visible.  If you see a card that you can use, you may take it, but you must also take all the cards that have been discarded on top of it, and you must play the lowest (physical) card in the deck as soon as you pick it up. If you only take the top card of the discard pile, you do not have to meld it immediately. (Variant: No wait, actually you do.)<br/><br/>The hand ends as soon as one player discards her last remaining card (going out). Cards on the table are worth positive points, and cards left in your hand are worth negative points.  Numbered cards from 2-10 are worth their pip value (Variant: 2-9 are worth 5); face-cards are worth 10 points; aces are worth 15 points, unless used in an A-2-3 run; jokers are worth 15 points. (Variant: All players add up the pip values of the cards in their hands, and those points are given to the player who went out.) A player who goes out without previously laying down any cards goes &quot;rummy,&quot; and scores double the points. Normally, games are played to 500 points, but players can opt to play to fewer points, or play a specific number of rounds.<br/><br/>When playing with 2, both players get 13 cards.  When playing with 3 or 4, each player gets 7 cards.  When playing with 5 or 6 players, each player receives 6 cards.<br/><br/>There are many other variations of the game.  Early versions of Rummy were often played with a 44-card deck, Ace through 11 in four suits.  In the 2-player version players are dealt 8 cards, with 3 or more players, the hand size is 6 cards.<br/><br/>One such variation, Romm\u00e9, played in Germany, requires that a player cannot start laying any cards down at all, until they have broken in with a lay down valued at 40 points or more (the exception being if you can play all of the 13 cards in your hand in one go).  In the German variant, each face card is 10, number cards are worth their shown number, aces are worth 11 (if used after the king or as a set) or 1 if used as a 1 in front of a 2 in a sequence.  Jokers are the value of the card they are representing.  This German rummy variant is also played with 2x52 cards + 6(or 4) jokers - for a 110 card deck.  Another difference from American Rummy is that one can only pick up the top discard, from a single growing discard pile - never a larger part of a spread out discard deck. Rather than scoring points based on what you have laid down in front of you, the winner (first person out), gets zero, and every other player adds up the cards remaining in their hands and takes that much in points (adding up the deadwood)  Here the player that finished has no deadwood.  When someone reaches 500 (or agreed to goal) the game ends and the player with the lowest score (least penalty points) wins.  Because of this 'breaking through with 40+' rule, this game is a bit more difficult and closer to Gin Rummy.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Amigo German Edition 2013", "ASS Kartenmacher Kunst Edition", "Bicycle Cards edition", "Bicycle Edition 2009", "Briarpatch Hello Kitty Edition", "Built-Rite Felix The Cat First Edition", "Built-Rite Felix The Cat Second Edition", "Built-Rite Shaped Cards edition", "Cadaco Care Bear edition", "Chad Valley Prehistoric Edition", "Clifford Blue Box Edition", "Clifford Extending Box Edition", "Clifford First Edition", "Clifford Red Box Edition", "Creative Child Games Edition", "Creative Child Story Time Edition", "Diddl Multilingual Edition", "E.E.

This exciting and unique card game invites players to compete to get the best directors and most famous actors for their films. With an easily accessible theme, and simple but deep gameplay, The Hollywood Card Game appeals as much to casual gamers as it does to hardcore strategists.<br/><br/>The game plays over 3-4 rounds (the same number as the number of players), with each player having one turn to play first. Each round a new Hollywood Area is created by shuffling 3 Star cards and 11 Movie cards together and dealing them out into 4 columns. Players take turns either placing a marker on the bottom card of a column (pushing the preceding markers up the column), or playing one of their Studio cards (Skip a turn, or take two turns in a row). Each studio card can only be used once per game. Once each card in a column has a marker on it, that column is closed, and no more markers have been played in this column.<br/><br/>Once all players have run out of markers, the round is over, and cards are allocated to players based on the marker on the card, and starting from the TOP left corner. Cards are allocated one at a time, and must be used on a Project immediately. Film cards must be allocated to a Project of the same genre (Horror, Action, or Romantic Comedy), or allocated to a new project if the player does not already have a Project of that genre. Star cards must be allocated to any project, however this will immediately complete a Movie, which no more cards can be added to. If a Star card cannot be allocated to a project, they cannot be held to add to a later project. Movies score points for the number of Film cards in them (with Award Film cards counting twice), multiplied by the number of stars on the Star card. Blockbuster cards stand alone and are worth 2 points each. Additionally, each player scores one point for each Film card in their largest unfinished project (no ties allowed). The player with the most points wins. If players are tied, the player with the single most valuable movie is the winner.<br/><br/>The Hollywood Card Game contains 64 cards, 16 film reel chips, and a rule sheet.

The game is played with a 40-card Italian deck (similar to a conventional deck minus either the 8s, 9s, and 10s or alternatively, the Js,  Qs, and Ks).  Four-player games are usually played in partnership; other numbers of players typically play for themselves.<br/><br/>In the original Scopa base game, four cards are turned face up on the table, and players are dealt hands of three cards.  On his or her turn, a player may capture any of the face-up cards on the table if the sum of the cards captured equals the value of the card played.  If a player cannot make a capture, he or she must discard a card face-up onto the table.  Cards are progressively handed out in lots of three until the deck is exhausted.<br/><br/>When the deck is exhausted, scoring is calculated.  Players earn 1 point for &quot;sweeping&quot; the table, that is, for clearing the table of all face-up cards; 1 point for capturing the most cards; 1 point for capturing the most cards of the coin suit; 1 point for capturing the 7 of coins (the &quot;settebello&quot;); and 1 point for the best &quot;primiera,&quot; that is, the best assemblage of high-value cards from each of the four suits.<br/><br/>The game is traditionally played until a player or team reaches a set number of points, usually 11 or 21.<br/> The name &quot;Scopa&quot; means &quot;sweep&quot; or &quot;broom&quot; in Italian, and refers to the action of picking up all face-up cards on the table.<br/><br/>In some ways, Scopa can be thought of as a precursor to many popular modern game designs.  The multiple competing goals and the limited hand-size make for a very modern-feeling game.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Gelb gewinnt!<br/>    Der Goldene Kompass: Das Kartenspiel zum Film<br/>    Shokoba<br/>    Templaria<br/>    Punto<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["ASS Siciliane Edition", "Cartamundi Dual Deck edition", "Gamer's edition 2013", "Outset Media English/French edition", "Pressman first edition", "Winning Moves Games Edition"], "average": "6.55585", "name": "Scopa", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Memory", "Partnerships", "Set Collection"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "564", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Card Games: Card Fishing", "Traditional Card Games"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The Spiel #119 - Classics Revisited", "The Spiel #16 - In The Cards"]}, "15890": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "The Mask 3-D Board Game", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pick-up and Deliver", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1994", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["3D Games"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic65843_t.jpg", "average": "2.75", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Parker Brothers"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic65843.jpg", "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "This track game is based on the Jim Carrey film &quot;The Mask&quot;.

This release ties into Grand Europa by providing state-of-the-art Order of Battle information on Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish armed forces from 1939 to 1945 and German Northern Theater armed forces from 1940 to 1943.<br/><br/>Five countersheets (1,400 counters) cover the entire theater of war.<br/><br/>Europa IV game.<br/><br/><br/>(from back of the box:)<br/><br/>Narvik:<br/>This is an intense combined arms game. Germany has an overwhelming array of ground, sea and air forces for the invasion. The Allies have time and space on their side. While they can not stand toe to toe with the Germans, they can cause a lot of trouble; they can win the game. This is the second most popular The Europa Series game ever produced. It has a very even play balance and offers unending variations.<br/><br/>Storm Over Scandinavia:<br/>The code name of the invasion: Weserubung. It started out as a junior officer and high command war game. A &quot;what-if&quot; scenario on how to invade Norway. It ended up as a full-blown, multi-corps invasion on the event of Germany's attack on France. The Europa level invasion of Norway. The combined arms are also present. The unit and time scales are at Europa levels.<br/><br/>The Four Hour War:<br/>Germany invades Denmark. Will the Danes resist (that would make it a Five Hour War)? Germany used Denmark as a stepping stone to Norway. Germany had to have a perfect invasion of Denmark to ensure a chance of success against Norway. If you choose to play this scenario, as the Germans, good luck. It is an eye-popping special ops gamble. If you lose as the Germans, no easy invasion for Norway.<br/><br/>Northern Theater of Operations (NTO):<br/>NTO Combines Weserubung and A Winter War. It begins with the Soviet attack against Finland. The western Allies may intervene to aid Finland. To do so they must transit through Norway. Norway may disagree with this and the Germans may intervene to prevent the Allied intervention. Makes your head hurt, don't it? Ownership of A Winter War (currently available from Games Research/Design (GR/D)) is required for this scenario.<br/><br/>Invasion Sweden:<br/>No tour of Scandinavia is complete without a visit to sunny Sweden, right? Well, why would the Germans invade Sweden? To prevent them from helping Norway? Maybe. To ensure a flow of iron ore to Germany? Perhaps. Because they can? Why not. Germany decided against this invasion, but now you have the option of testing out such an invasion in this scenario.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.35476", "name": "Storm Over Scandinavia", "playingtime": "480", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["33589"], "usersrated": "42", "boardgameaccessory": ["Europa By Mail, Europa play aids kit 6"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Europa Series"]}, "15991": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Jenga Casino", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2000", "usersrated": "28", "boardgamefamily": ["Jenga"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1415018_t.jpg", "average": "5.57857", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Hasbro", "Milton Bradley", "USAopoly"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1415018.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch edition", "First Edition 2000", "USAopoly edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Party Game"], "age": "18", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Party favorite Jenga with Casino theme.

Every horse, starting from no.1 to no.12, gets out from its stables (San Siro at Milan or Capannelle at Rome) and rolling two dice it runs one full lap, before re-entering its own stable.<br/>During this lap the players collect Advantage colored chits (to be used as bonus during the race) or Disadvantage white chits (to be spent during the race as penalties), and pay various taxes for the maintenance, health and fitness of their horses.<br/>To be said, a good training isn't enough to grant you have a winner, because the subsequent race phase bears a great share of randomness.<br/>Totopoli is not only a racing game, but a betting one also, so this is perfectly normal.<br/>Luck and tactics here join together while you're searching for the best lane in every situation, but along the track some dangers are lurking to slow or either exit your horse from the race.<br/>You can win the game as being the winner at the race, or you can win through your money.<br/>And you can play dirty to ease the way for the horse you bet on.<br/>The box includes a double sided board, 12 plastic horses, 78 cards, Advantage and Disadvantage chits, bet bills and two dice.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "age": "8", "name": "Totopoli", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Betting/Wagering", "Modular Board", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Stock Holding"], "average": "6.32069", "usersrated": "29", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Horse Racing"]}, "15999": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic340504.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Francis Tresham"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2004", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamepublisher": ["Tresham Games"], "boardgameintegration": ["1825 Unit 1", "1825 Unit 2", "1825 Unit 1", "1825 Unit 2"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic340504_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Trains", "Transportation"], "description": "The final unit in Francis Tresham's 1825 series.
