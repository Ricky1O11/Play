Secret Outpost is kept separate and not shuffled in with the Gambit Cards or the Trade Deck.<br/><br/>Players keep Gambit cards face down in front of them until they choose to reveal them. Gambit cards never go to the trade deck, your hand or personal deck. They have silver borders to make it easier to keep them separate from your other cards.

Wells published War of the Worlds in 1898, the stories about invaders from other worlds have become a staple of the science fiction genre. Numerous real-world panics have been created by people who were terrified by the idea of aliens coming to our planet with evil intent. Certainly there are also many stories  about aliens who are peaceful, tolerant, and wise; these being come to Earth with benign intentions, and often it is the humans who are the villains. Still, it is easy to understand why the prospect of encountering another species is so frightening. What if they are not benevolent? What if their society is not the epitome of advanced culture and enlightened values? In otherwords, what if they are just like us: flawed, violent, and willing to take what they want by force?<br/><br/>Human history is riddled with examples of contact between formerly isolated cultures.

The Olympics will be arriving in the ancient city of Beijing in a year&rsquo;s time. In the meantime there is a legion of administrators, workers, corporations and government officials working to make the city presentable before the flocks of tourists descend. One of the most ambitious projects, spanning the last 6 years, has been the expansion of the oldest subway system in Asia.<br/><br/>A tower block collapses after a subway tunnel is dug through several danger zones that should never have been approved. All the official connections check out but there are complaints among the workforce of blackouts, strange dreams and migraines. Strange radio frequencies have been recorded throughout the city around the time of the accident. Somewhere in the newly built tunnels an old dreamer has made its nest. Through its subtle influences it aims to  construct a great glyph beneath the city but until then it sleeps. Unlike those whose dreams it visits...<br/><br/>This scenario is ideal for 2-5 investigators and is set in modern day Beijing. The scenario is system free, though guidance is provided on running all characters and encounters. The adventure focuses on player interaction and puzzle solving and should be enjoyable for any group looking for an investigative game, especially as a one-shot.<br/><br/>Recommended Systems: Any system designed to emulate a real-world/urban fantasy setting should be able to run this scenario with few issues. Atlas Games' Unknown Armies, White Wolf's World of Darkness and Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu all work well and Pelgrane Press' GUMSHOE system would work to emphasise the investigative elements.<br/><br/>Content Warnings: Due to the nature of Horror games, this product contains discussion of hallucinations and body horror.<br/><br/>"}, "179157": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Umbra", "rpgproducer": {"81935": "Angel Miranda"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2554821.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"276334": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2554821_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Unleash the fury of the umbra base class upon your foes (or upon your players).

There is no unwanted over-complexity, as with some rules. Melee is divided into three segments: attack and defense are factored for the throw-to-hit, followed by the damage throw and optional hit location throw. Three dice rolls... the minimum necessary for a comprehensive combat system.<br/><br/>Realistic: The rules describe a convincing world, where commonsense and initiative count for a great deal. There are no superhuman characters carving up a dozen men single-handed-- just ordinary mortals with some skill in swordplay or sorcery, trying to use their wits to stay alive.<br/><br/>Clear: Presentation is lucid throughout. At a glance, you can see the range or duration of a spell, the attack factor of a creature, the cost of distilling a potion, etc. For quick reference during play, the essential combat charts are reproduced on back of this sheet;<br/><br/>Adaptable: The book presents a logical and consistent representation of &quot;sword and sorcery&quot; reality, so that any concept from fantastic literature can be readily fitted into the structure. The rules are designed for flexibility, and with a minimum of effort can be adapted for use with other FRP games.

Meat is roasted in the center of the inn, usually pork but sometimes beef. While the meat is cooked, a tale telling contest is held around the fire. The bard with the best tale gets a free cut of pork or steak. The combination of the smell of roasting meat and anticipation of a good meal paired with ale and mead paired with good stories being told packs The Fireside on Saturdays.<br/><br/>The group may visit The Fireside to rest after an adventure. A bard or troubadour character might even be actively part of the contest.  The night goes as planned until the winner of the contest, Brad, eats his free steak, becomes violently ill, and drops dead. The barkeeper seals The Fireside to prevent the killer from leaving and waits for the city guard to arrive and begin an investigation.<br/><br/>The group may be able to convince the barkeep to allow them to head the investigation until the city guards arrive provided they were not part of the contest and their reputation is good. Everyone in the tale telling contest is a potential suspect as well as the kitchen staff. The assassin who poisoned the steak is still in the tavern and the group should be given a chance to ferret him out before the city guards arrive. If they do figure out who is the assassin, they have to deal with a powerful poisoner who loves to use envenomed light weapons to deliver his deadly venoms to his victims.<br/><br/>Who ordered the hit on Brad?

Gateway to Caen focuses on the largest, concentrated British offensive since the Normandy landings in an attempt to penetrate the German lines west of Caen and cross the Odon River to get the stalled advance moving again.<br/><br/>With Close Combat: Gateway to Caen you can play at the strategic and tactical level, putting yourself in the boots of both the generals and the platoon commanders. You can move or combine your battlegroups on the strategic level and decide the outcome of battles on the tactical level. You will command squads in close combat situations, using small arms, mortars, machine guns, armored cars, and tanks to triumph against the enemy. You command artillery and mortar barrages and even air strikes. You will get to know individual solders, platoons, battalions, and the larger brigades and battle groups which they comprise.<br/><br/>Players can experience the desperate situation of the outnumbered, but well-armed Panzergrenadiers, or the daunting offensive mission of the fully-supported British infantry advancing across the treacherous Odon Valley. At your command are Churchill, Cromwell, Firefly, Sherman, Stuart tanks and more. Panther, Tiger, Stug, and Mk.IV tanks will arrive to support German Panzergrenadiers as they try to hold the line against a concerted British attack.<br/><br/>The historic scope of Operation Epsom is captured in single battles, operations, and the grand campaign. The strategic battlefield offers over two dozen individual battlefields with over three dozen accurately portrayed German and British battle groups. British infantry regimental history is reflected in name among the various battalions. You can deploy your battalions as they actually fought in the struggle for the Odon. The game includes all new maps and a range of upgraded effects.<br/><br/>The Setting<br/><br/>With the success of the Allied landings at Normandy and their domination of air and sea, expectations were high that the momentum would continue on land. It was not to be so. Though initially surprised and overwhelmed, the German Army quickly recovered, mobilized, and, counterattacked. Field Marshal Rommel formed a capable defense in Normandy that made the Allied advance costly. Superior Allied artillery and air power failed to crack the German lines. Though the Norman City of Caen was originally a British D-Day objective, its capture would elude and frustrate Montgomery&rsquo;s 21st Army for weeks to come. Operation Epsom was Field Marshall Montgomery&rsquo;s first concentrated attempt to go around the city and the Odon River, and break through the strengthening German bulwark. The newly-arrived British VIII Corps, supported by 700 guns of the Royal Artillery made a go of it along a four-mile front between Rauray and Carpiquet. Defending that front was the infamous 12th SS Panzer Division. Though reduced by weeks of heavy fighting they remained a potent and experienced foe. The Germans had offensive plans too, but the British struck first, and the 2nd SS Panzer Corps, the last of Germany&rsquo;s offensive reserves in Normandy, was instead committed to stopping the British breakthrough along the Odon. Can you, as Montgomery and his commanders, re-chart the course of the Normandy campaign and prevail against Germany&rsquo;s SS Panzer divisions?  Can you as the Germans, once again stop Montgomery, or eclipse history and push the British back entirely?<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "179283": {"boardgamedesigner": {"83357": {"name": "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Czigl\u00e9dszky"}}, "average": "7.64", "poll": {}, "name": "Deadline Saloon", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2686": "Take That"}, "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "5", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2563394_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"83358": "G\u00e1bor Turi\u00e1k"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2563394.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"276615": "The Game Crafter edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1055": {"name": "American West"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "In a godforsaken town in the wild west a new saloon has opened. Citizents are scrambling for the admission in hopes of free booze. With wise and smart decisions you need to help them to achieve their goals and at the same time impede on other players as much as you can. Each citizen has unique capabilities supporting their admission but your decisions and tactics can make them succeed in this entertaining card game.<br/><br/>Setup: At the beginning sort all the cards by color. Each players chooses a certain color. The optional characters (negative numbers) can be used or can be excluded from the deck at your will. For the first few playthroughs, until you get familiar with the characters and game mechanics, it&rsquo;s best to play without the optional characters. Each player shuffles all of their cards, deal out 4 cards for their hands and placing the rest face down in front of them. Place the Entrance card on the table and in clockwise order the players begin to put their cards one-by-one next to the Entrance card.<br/> Gameplay: (each step is mandatory)<br/><br/>    Place a card<br/>    Execute the action for character of the placed card<br/>    Execute starred characters&rsquo; actions in the queue from back to front. In every turn each character executes their action once, hence if a starred card is placed during the turn then its action won&rsquo;t be executed again.<br/>    Draw a card if you have less than 4 cards in hand.<br/>    If there are at least 5 cards in the queue then the first 2 cards enters the Saloon. At the end of the game (even if Thief is in the queue) when all of the cards are played out the first card of the last queue enters the Saloon and the others go to the Cemetery. Cards are collected facing down.<br/>    If the color of the last card of the queue doesn&rsquo;t match the color of one of the cards which enters the Saloon then the last card walks sadly to the Cemetery. Optional rule: The player whose character walked to the cemetery is allowed (but not compulsorily) to draw one card from one of their opponent&rsquo;s hand if this opponent holds at least 4 cards in their hand. The player puts the drawn card facing up in front of the opponent. The opponent must play out this drawn card in their next turn. Card can not be drawn from opponent who already has a drawn card in front of them.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Ending: Game ends when all of the cards are played out. The player who has the most characters in the Saloon wins. If several players end up with a tie then the player whose characters in the saloon have the lowest overall values wins.<br/><br/>"}, "179284": {"rpgitemversion": {"276617": "PDF version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Torp\u00e9o Inanem", "rpgproducer": {"8842": "jim pinto"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2556125.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"161": "Mythology / Folklore"}, "rpg": {"24381": "Protocol Game Series"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2556125_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Torpeo Inanem is a story roleplaying game about existentialism and the surreal realities of the human mind.

The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete.

The raid leader is a new monster, a one-horned goblin oni that lives only for her next drink and acts of sadistic violence.<br/><br/>If the PCs do not stop her, she will make off with most of the year&rsquo;s profits, wagonloads of brew, and leave the small town to starve.

Four to six players engage in head-to-head (-to-head-to-head) constant combat until the frenzy peaks and one player emerges victorious.<br/><br/>Set in an alternate 1920s, an eclectic collection of some of the world&rsquo;s greatest fighters are pitted against each other by the magnanimous Baron Reginald Fistcuffington Smythe aboard his monolithic floating airship. Baron Smythe, inventor of the new super-element Hydrolium, offers the winner of his &quot;Fisticuffs Bouts&quot; the granting of a single wish, whatever their heart desires most. The surviving fighter will get their wish fulfilled - and become champion of Fisticuffs!<br/><br/>Gameplay is simple. Each player picks a fighter from our cast of characters, each with their own backstory and special move. The stable of fighters include a sky pirate, a flapper, a saxo-magician, the son of a slain Chicago mayor, and a robot built by Baron Smythe himself. Every player gives their fiercest battle cry, and whoever&rsquo;s is best begins the game.<br/><br/>Each player starts with five cards from the Punch Card deck. These Punches will be a fighter&rsquo;s offense and defense. On a player&rsquo;s turn, they throw a Punch against any opponent - but that player can Block if they are holding a Punch of the same name. This leaves the attacking player open for a Counter, allowing the defending player to attack with a Punch that is the same color as their Block.<br/><br/>Combat continues until a Punch goes un-Blocked or a Block goes un-Countered. When an attack successfully lands, the defending player loses health. Everybody starts at 12, and when they reach 0, they&rsquo;re knocked out for the rest of the match. Every remaining player gets a turn each round.<br/><br/>Once a full round (one turn for everybody) has been completed, the fighters return to their corner. This is when you draw new Punch Cards - and when you get a Round Card, a special action that will help provide a tactical advantage by giving you more attacks, depleting an opponent&rsquo;s defenses, or giving you the edge you need in the middle of combat. The new round begins to the left of the person who started the last round.<br/><br/>The rounds keep going until there are two boxers left, at which point they enter Close Combat - no more rounds, no more Round Cards, just two boxers fighting over one dream. The fighter that is left standing is the winner of the bout and the champion of Fisticuffs!<br/><br/>"}, "179306": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Silven Trumpeter (Issue 2 - Sep 2003)", "rpgproducer": {"22722": "Dana Driscoll"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2556467.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"3883": "Silven Trumpeter"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"150282": "Antipodean Adventures"}, "rpg": {"524": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"276643": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2556467_t.jpg", "description": "Gaming tips, Review of NWN: SoU; The Warrior's Edge<br/><br/>"}, "179307": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Silven Trumpeter (Issue 3 - Oct 2003)", "rpgproducer": {"22722": "Dana Driscoll"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2556474.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"3883": "Silven Trumpeter"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"150308": "'Feel' and the Art of DMing"}, "rpg": {"524": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"276644": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2556474_t.jpg", "description": "The Ins and Outs of Evil; The Seven Blades of Samanume; Alternative Rewards for Roleplaying; Star's Night - Part 2<br/><br/>"}, "179308": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Cr\u00edtico: La revista de rol (n\u00ba 2 - Spring 2014)", "rpgproducer": {"58597": "Jorge Coto Bautista"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2559315.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"27584": "Cr\u00edtico: Revista de Rol"}, "rpg": {"25626": "Fragmentos"}, "rpgissueversion": {"276680": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2559315_t.jpg", "description": "Entradilla de la revista:<br/><br/>Cr&iacute;tico 02.<br/><br/>Publicada en primavera 2014.<br/><br/>Versi&oacute;n f&iacute;sica.

However, the resources were limited &hellip; And, industrialization was inevitably ahead&hellip; So, at a glance, the faces of tiny villages have been changed to modern cities&hellip; Colonies rapidly developed new cities, built massive factories, used airplanes to collect the resources, and scratched the sky with their high-rise business centers... The danger of foreigners was always around&hellip; Hence, the incomers funded the costly militaries to protect their people&hellip; War was not always an option&hellip; Thus, they established diplomacy and started trading with their neighbors&hellip; Famine lead to demand for more lands&hellip; So, the settlers were convinced to invade new lands and raise their own flags on them&hellip; And now this is the question: whose flags will remain waving on the horizon?<br/><br/>Raising the Flags is a strategic board game where every player is a leader of a colony. The winner of the game is the one who creates the most prosperous territory. The game occurs on an island containing various lands and cities. Each player begins the adventure by selecting a capital city and raising the main flag on it. Players should expand the territory with the construction of new buildings such as farms, houses, factories, airports and business centers, and by harvesting crude resources including, food, wood, stone and oil. The players also experience negotiation and trading with neighbors, tricking and attacking them&hellip;<br/>The game board is an island which contains four different tiles, including sea, resources, lands and cities. Each player starts the game by selecting a city as the own capital city and raises the main flag in that capital city. Then, it is time to expand the territory, construct the buildings, generate and trade resources with other players based on some pre-determined rules. The players expand their territory and raise the land flags on them. Then, they start to construct new building on the own territories. Simultaneous with construction of every new building, the player must select a building flag and raise it on the top of that constructed building. Selection of a flag is according to the player&rsquo;s own decision, which can be aimed by the logic of probability. When a player rolls two dices, the summation of both dices will make a number. If this number is matched with any flag number on top of any player&rsquo;s building, the owner player will receive the income of that particular building. Therefore, the territory of each player is expanded according to the optimal construction of the buildings and efficient way of raising the flags. During a gameplay, management of resources/money, planning to expand lands and cities, effective negotiation with neighbors, wise decision to attack other players, defending territory, and of course having a bit of  luck will make a player closer to the final victory.<br/><br/>"}, "179353": {"boardgamedesigner": {"42079": {"name": "Mitsuo Yamamoto"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Cifra", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2676": "Grid Movement"}, "yearpublished": "1994", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2556986_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"42079": "Mitsuo Yamamoto"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"21552": {"name": "Logy Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2556986.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"276720": "Japanese first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "User summary: <br/>In this game, players advance 1-9 pieces to their opponent's side to compete with all their pieces.<br/><br/>The movement of pieces is determined by the pattern of the tiles making up the board.

As a result, those shamans who are able to make contact with more spirits have a distinct advantage over those limited to the same spirits known to all shamans.<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s where this book comes in. Inside, you&rsquo;ll find three brand new shaman spirits, including the ravages spirit, the rest spirit, and the time spirit. Hateful and venomous things, ravages spirits are embodiments of pestilence, poison, and decay in all things. Use their power to enhance and create poisons and diseases, and to level powerful curses upon your enemies. By contrast, spirits of rest are jolly and agreeable things, that bring comfort and respite. Use them to put your foes to sleep, or to ensure that your party recovers fully from the wounds and fatigue of battle. Finally, the elusive and mysterious time spirits allow shamans to speed themselves and their allies, slow their foes, and even make quick trips through time, including summoning their future self to fight by their side!<br/><br/>"}, "179371": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Advanced Merfolk", "rpgproducer": {"23869": "Dale C.

The world has changed and will not return to it&rsquo;s previous state. In 2052 Umbratech, the first major corporation to rise from the ashes of the ecological wars of the mid 40&rsquo;s grew in power and ambition. With their invention of the world&rsquo;s first Planetary Core Reactor, located on the undersea Mid-Atlantic Ridge, it was hoped that the world would never again rely on non-renewable sources of energy. However, things did not go as planned. With no knowledge of the deepest crusts scientists blindly drilled to reach the intense heat of the Earth&rsquo;s Core, relying on theoretical data on the makeup of the Earth&rsquo;s layers. They were wrong, and a rapid reactor failure ensued, allowing the Earth&rsquo;s mantle to bleed through the crust. Massive continental shift occurred, along with earthquakes and a total disruption of oceanic ecosystems. A new continent emerged from the ridge, born in a matter of months. Midatlantia, as it was called, was both rich in resources and hotly contested. New ocean currents, melted icecaps, and the worldwide destruction of cities launched a new era on the Earth as world powers fought bitterly for the new and old land alike.<br/><br/>This war was known as the Mid-Atlantic War. By 2057 the war was over, and an alliance of the warring states had been formed to share the land. However, shortly after colonization the Mid-Atlantic Alliance ceded from their mother nations and declared independence, causing worldwide uproar. The troubles of creating a new nation were soon soothed by the vast wealth of Midatlantia, and the world was quickly ready to begin trade despite misgivings about the legitimacy of such a nation.<br/><br/>In 2064, the world&rsquo;s first, large scale underwater research station was created under the mantle of international cooperation. Recognizing that the ocean held untold secrets which would ultimately benefit mankind, the major nations of the world came together to form the International Maritime Collective. Together, they created the International Oceanic Observatory and Research Facility, often referred to as &ldquo;The Dome&rdquo;. This underwater facility was built on the floor of the Mariana trench in the Atlantic Ocean, thousands of feet beneath the surface. It has now been operational for fourteen years. Numerous scientific advances have been achieved through its research and thousands of new species have been cataloged and studied, resulting in cures for many diseases and new technologies that improve the lives of people everywhere. But rumour has it that scientists aboard the station have been conducting unauthorized research as well.<br/><br/>Overview: Fathoms is a cooperative adventure game with miniatures in which a group of players fight against hordes of undersea monsters controlled by a game master. Gameplay is designed to pit players against a changing environment as monsters swarm and water pours through hull breaches. Players advance their characters skills and armament by gaining experience. The game can be played in campaign mode in which a series of missions unfold a storyline, or as one-shot scenarios.<br/><br/>Gameplay: Fathoms begins by one player assuming the role of the Fathom Master, while the others pick from a selection of characters. Both the Fathom Master and the other players earn experience points. Players use it advance their character in skills that benefit either themselves or the whole team and to buy equipment. The Fathom Master uses it to unleash increasing terrors upon the players, such as more monsters or events like hull breaches. Players gain experience when they explore, kill monsters or use computer terminals to perform various tasks. This experience may be used between missions or at equipment lockers. The Fathom Master gains experience by damaging players and may spend it on his turn.<br/><br/>The game board functions as a grid and the line of sight rules are relatively simple. Each player receives two actions which may be divided any way they choose. In any order or repetition a player may move, attack or use an item/door/skill. Turn order is determined by rolling for initiative. Each player has 1 miniature which they maneuver through the rooms on the game board. When new rooms are opened, the Fathom Master places units depending on the number of players he opposes. Some of those units are predetermined while other may be bought with experience to add variability. Each round the Fathom Master follows the mission guide to keep the game evolving.<br/><br/>Modes of Play:<br/>Fathoms offers two modes of play: Campaign mode and Scenarios<br/><br/>There are 7 missions in Campaign mode, all of which are meant to be played sequentially as the story unfolds. Scenarios are one-shot missions that represent possible scenarios that could have occurred over the course of the storyline.<br/><br/>Game End: The game ends when players complete either the Campaign storyline or a one-shot Scenario. The game also ends if all Players are killed during a mission. Players that don't work well with others die, quickly.<br/><br/>Unique Elements: What makes Fathoms different than other adventure games is its use of water as an important game element. As the players progress through the game they encounter pools of water and hull breaches that will flood the map room by room. One simple rule guides the flow of water from room to room, making it simple to work with and compelling in the way it changes the battlefield. In water, weapons may become stronger or weaker, some skills may cease to be effective, and monsters grow stronger and more formidable.<br/><br/>Fathoms also has high-ground, which can give tactical advantage whether a room is dry or flooding with water.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"276782": "First edition"}, "age": "14", "name": "Fathoms", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "average": "5", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"5607": "3D Games"}}, "179391": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3280586.png", "poll": {}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"83047": "Gipi"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"21608": {"name": "CMON Limited"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3280586_t.png", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "A box set of four Zombicide: Black Plague survivors that were designed by the Italian artist Gipi.

Your goal is to earn victory points by expanding your territory while making your opponent lose their territory.<br/><br/>You initially control a territory with three hexes and one robot token on the hexagonal grid board. Each turn, you move one of your robots to expand or secure your territory. A robot can move to any hex within your territory or one hex outside, including hexes marked by your opponent, except for a hex adjacent to or occupied by your opponent's robot.<br/><br/>After movement, place one of your occupation markers on the destination hex if there isn't a marker there already. This hex is now part of your territory. If the hex was your opponent's, they lose control of it, and if this causes their territory to be split, they lose control of all hexes not connected with their robot. Discard all their occupation markers on these hexes.<br/><br/>Your opponent's robots cannot move to one of your hexes adjacent to or occupied by your robot, so secure your territory by moving your robot wisely.<br/><br/>Some hexes have a higher value but have a special requirement to control. As you expand your territory, you will be able to deploy more robots and fulfill the requirement to control these hexes.<br/><br/>The game ends when either player uses up their 30 occupation markers. Add up your victory points earned by hexes you control and occupation markers your opponent discarded.

Victory points (VPs) can be won by collecting creatures, completing missions, building your research lab, and smacking down your enemies! Creature College is played in three university terms: Spring, Autumn and Winter. Each term consists of three bidding rounds and one battle round. At the end of twelve rounds the game ends and the player with the most VPs wins.<br/><br/>To start the game, every player takes a player mat, a set of bidding tokens, and playing pieces in their color. Three ability cards are then dealt to each player from which they can choose one. The ability cards allow them to personalize their player a little. The ability card sits face up in the space provided on the player mat. They then take three missions and again choose one. The missions come in 15, 20 and 25 VP types and show a set of cards the player must collect to complete the mission. The mission card sits face down in the space provided on the player mat.<br/><br/>In the bidding round, a number of creature cards are laid face up in the play area (determined by number of players). The players bid in player order (determined by who bid highest in the previous bidding round) if someone is outbid they have to move to a different creature card. Once all bidding has been completed, the players roll two dice and either take research lab cards to fill their research lab slots or battle cards to help them in battle. If Kevin the Giga-Pig has turned up during the bidding phase, all players must now try and battle Kevin. After three bidding rounds, there is a battle round. In player order, players now fight the players either side of them by choosing one or more cards in a single suit, tapping the card (by turning it 90&ordm;) and choosing to fight right or left players first. Battle cards may be added in each battle separately, and if the attacking player wins, they get green gems; if they lose, red gems.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"276884": "English first edition"}, "age": "8", "name": "Creature College", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "average": "6.40667", "usersrated": "45", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "179435": {"boardgamedesigner": {"613": {"name": "Jonathan Leistiko"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Hierarchy", "playingtime": "75", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2563068_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"320": {"name": "Invisible City Productions"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2563068.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"276886": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "75", "boardgamecategory": {"1026": {"name": "Negotiation"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Hierarchy is a highly interactive negotiation and voting game, built on top of a simple roll-and-move game, with a splash of player selected special player powers on top for spice.

By the moment, contrarily to my interest, the rules are by far not simple, ...im trying to improve that. I tried to achieve complexity by giving to the game a very chaotical and recursive nature. The board is defined in order to try to let an action to have infinite repercussion in the unfolding of the game. Its notable that, strictly speaking, the board doesnt have borders (as may be seen in the rules), so there is no &quot;preferential positions&quot;. Its interesting to note that the definition of &quot;loop&quot; does lead to literally infinite possibilities of combination in some cases (its definition is precisely the feature that has leadme to think that this game can be much more than just &quot;dificult&quot; for the computer...). And its interesting to note that wining implies to reduce this possibilities to one, that is, to reduce the number of possibilities, which is the thermodynamic definition of negative entropy. So you have to play with chaos to bring order.<br/><br/>Equipment: <br/>- 9x9 Torus board with 9x9 square grid (a standard 9x9 GO board can be used, obeying the mechanic of the torus board), 18xwhite stones, 18xblack stones. (i decided this size mostly to facilitate initial playtesting. Of course the game can be played in larger boards)<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>1 - Game is played on the intersections. Adjacency is defined as orthogonal and diagonal (i.e. every intersection point has 8 adjacent points).<br/><br/>2 - There can&rsquo;t be more than 18 total stones on the board at any time.<br/><br/>3 - We will call &quot;piece&quot; to every single stone or loop. A piece is of the color of a player if every stone that composes it is of the color of that player. A piece is &quot;at range&quot; of another if they shares at least one of their adjacent intersections.<br/><br/>4 - We will call &quot;loop&quot; to every group of pieces (regardless of color) where every piece is at range of at least another two pieces of the group (nothing prevents loops for sharing pieces). Its implied by the rule, but to clarify: If a piece A is composed by all the stones that composes a piece B, and viceversa, then A and B are the same piece, and B cant be considered has &quot;another&quot; piece for A, and viceversa.<br/><br/>5 - We will say that a piece is &quot;conditioned&quot; to a player if its of the player color or if any group of pieces (regardless of color) that are at range of that piece conforms a loop.<br/><br/>6 - A player makes a &quot;move&quot; by either:<br/>a) Taking a single stone of his color from the outside of the board and placing it in an empty place over the board.<br/>b) Removing a piece that is conditioned to him from the board.<br/>c) Removing a piece that is conditioned to him from the board, and then placing it back on an empty space on the board. If the removed piece is a loop, it has to remain a loop when placed back on the board.<br/><br/>7 - At the start of the game the board is empty. Each player is assigned a color. Black plays first. Then both players play alternately. In his turn, a player can do one or two moves, if he has no legal move to perform the game ends, and he loses.<br/><br/>"}, "179460": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2642989.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"45986": "Stronghold"}, "is_expanded_by": {"206593": {"name": "Stronghold: Undead (2nd edition)"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"4735": {"name": "Ignacy Trzewiczek"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"18700": "Mariusz Gandzel"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2726": {"name": "Portal Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2642989_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1010": {"name": "Fantasy"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"34501": "2015 Golden Geek Best 2-Player Board Game Nominee"}, "description": "Stronghold is a two-player game telling the story of a siege.

There are six kinds of cards (numbered from 1 to 5, with two kinds of &quot;4&quot; cards), speed chips, fuel chips, and victory tokens.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the round, each player is dealt six cards and five fuel chips. Like typical trick-taking games, the first player leads by playing a card from his/her hand and other players play one by one. The number on the played card represents the speed of the player's racing car. When playing the card, the player has the option to increase the speed of the car by paying a fuel chip(s) and/or a speedy chip(s). Usually, the fastest car wins the trick, but the tricky part is that the value of &quot;4&quot; and &quot;5&quot; cards become all 0s if there is any &quot;1&quot; card played in the trick.<br/><br/>Players also have the option of playing his/her card face-down, giving up the trick but receiving (possible multiple number of) fuel chips from the supply as compensation. Another way to receive a fuel chip is to play a &quot;2&quot; card. But be aware that a player can store a maximum of five fuel chips. Meanwhile, a speed chip is awarded to the player who wins the trick. This means that the player who wins earlier tricks becomes more advantageous for the later tricks.<br/><br/>The most important trick is the last (6th) trick, since only the player who wins the last trick receives a victory token. The player who earns the most victory tokens after a certain number of rounds is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>"}, "179488": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2560520.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"2850": {"name": "Markus Stumptner"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"2850": "Markus Stumptner"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "boardgameintegration": {"217608": "Quatre Bras"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2560520_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1051": {"name": "Napoleonic"}}, "description": "Using the Napoleonic version of the March into Battle system, this game portrays the Battle of Ligny in a furious, fast moving three turn game.

After players play through those first five chapters, players can go on to create their own unique adventures, or go to the Trivatch.com Forums page to check out game types others are creating.<br/><br/>The game is played on tiles (some holding decks representing the Roads, the Ocean, and the Forest). While seeking to complete different objectives, players hunt across Rakasa by moving their player tokens to the different locations and battle creatures using their player equipment. Players use the parts of defeated creatures to upgrade their equipment. Though upgrading isn't ever the main objective in the Introductory Five Chapters, players are much more likely to succeed in their adventures with stronger equipment.<br/><br/>Along with hunting, crafting, and battling using the cards in Rakasa, players perform different actions using Rakmin, a mini puzzle game included in Legends of Rakasa. Rakmin consist of small tiles and dice. The Rakmin puzzle system is used for actions such as tracking down something or unlocking items.<br/><br/>Five Chapter Story cards guide players through the introductory chapters of Rakasa. The events of these chapters play out over the space of roughly three days in Rakasa. Time passes, hour by hour each turn. Day turns to night and night to day as the events of the chapters unfold. Players may decide to work together cooperatively or work in competition with each other throughout all of the chapters.<br/><br/>The Introductory Five Chapters can be played as individual game instances (each consisting of 30 minutes to an hour of gameplay). The chapters can be played as a set of sequential events, with players progressing their equipment through the chapters. Players can also jump straight into a chapter without playing previous chapters by starting with general gear that matches the difficulty level of the game at that point in the Introductory Five Chapters. After playing through the standard chapters of Legends of Rakasa: Fordra, players will be ready to venture off and create legends of their own!<br/><br/>"}, "179494": {"rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Wardenhale: Gambling Den", "rpgproducer": {"72892": "J.
