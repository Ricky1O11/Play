The vessels featured within these pages are all warships used by The Hub Federation in Gypsy Knights Games&rsquo; Clement Sector.  It is highly recommended that before you read this volume that you are familiar with the contents of Clement Sector and The Hub Federation (both of which are available from Gypsy Knights Games) as well as the Traveller Main Rulebook and Book 2: High Guard (which are available from Mongoose Publishing).<br/><br/>The first vessel detailed here is the Kiviat-class patrol corvette.   The Kiviat-class is a patrol corvette designed and built by the Hub Federation to combat the local piracy problem.  Armed to the teeth and lightning fast, the Kiviat is more than capable of hunting down and destroying any pirates in the region.  At 600 tons, the Kiviat can make an ideal ship on which to set an adventure.  The ship could be used as the basis of a naval campaign, an enemy for those characters engaged in piracy, or a powerful personal ship for a group of hardcore adventurers.<br/><br/>The second vessel shown here is the Vulkan-class attack boat tender.  The Vulkan-class is a power projecting attack boat tender capable of carrying twelve deadly attack boats which the elite pilots of the Hub Federation Navy strive to be assigned.  The Vulkan and her dangerous squadrons of attack boats can make an ideal ship for adventure.  Vulkan can be used as the basis of an ongoing naval campaign, as the rescuing &quot;cavalry&quot; for characters in trouble, or as a fearsome adversary for your party of pirates.<br/><br/>The third ship featured is the mighty Moltke-class cruiser.  The Moltke-class cruiser is the largest ship in the Hub Federation navy and is currently the flagship of that force.  The ship is designed to destroy other large warships and act as a command ship for squadrons assigned to attack the fleets of other worlds if the need arises. The Moltke is an excellent ship for active navy campaigns, a perfect location for a diplomatic conference, a fearsome opponent or the ultimate warship to save the characters' lives if they are in peril.<br/><br/>While each of these ships has been specifically designed to fit into the Clement Sector setting, they could easily be used in other Traveller settings or within other science fiction RPGs if needed.<br/><br/>Get on board!

Not only are they good for deflecting incoming blows, they also double as handy weapons in a pinch, and, if decked out in your personal heraldry, can serve as a sort of badge and nameplate all rolled up into one. The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook does little to differentiate shields from armor, however, with the few shield-only magic abilities mostly being those that are related to shield bashing. This book provides over 50 new magic shield (and, in some cases, armor) special abilities that capture the flavor and identity of shields. The abilities range from some that cost less than a +1 enhancement bonus to six +5-equivalent abilities, with an even distribution in between, ensuring something for everyone.<br/><br/>Absorb spells cast upon you and use them to enhance your AC with the arcane consumption special ability, or turn your shield into a true engine of bashing destruction with battering, which not only makes it deal damage as though it were two sizes larger, but also improves your ability to wield your shield and another weapon at the same time. If you prefer to use your shield to attack from a range, the hateful blast ability allows it to gain charges as you take damage, and then unleash a mighty discharge of hateful, damaging energy on your command, or you could simply watch as the dragon from your dragon emblem shield comes to life and devours your foes for you.<br/><br/>The book also contains several mundane enhancements for shields, allowing characters of even 1st or 2nd level to be able to purchase customized, enhanced shields. Finally, there are 10 new specific shields, each of which has a rich history and physical description, making them evocative as soon as they&rsquo;re dropped in your game, and each of which also contains a special ability unique to them, such as the discus of destruction, which, when thrown, ricochets from one target to another, for a devastating mass attack, or the shield of the undying warrior, whose wielder can never be slain as long as he holds it.<br/><br/>"}, "162531": {"rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Campaign Chunks Volume Three", "rpgproducer": {"44884": "Chris Kentlea"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2078284.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"246205": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"25491": "Campaign Chunks"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2078284_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>A Campaign Chunk is an item, place or something else that can fit into any campaign or story with little or no modification, although some will be more suited to certain genres than others.<br/><br/>They have few stats and can help provide starting grounds for adventures or help fill in the gaps when your players go off exploring and you need something for them to do.

He became passionate about drawing very early, never imagining that sketching monsters, warriors, and other childish fantasies could be a job.<br/><br/>In 1997, he participated in the creation of the game production company Rackham, co-founded by his brother Rapha&euml;l Guiton. Edouard worked as Rackham&rsquo;s main character designer for many years, in addition to working on illustrations, covers, and concepts for different game and video game publishers.<br/><br/>Edouard&rsquo;s first comics, produced by Soleil, appeared in 2009. In that same year, Edouard began working with Ankama, an important, young French company, producing cartoons, video games, games, toys, and comics. Edouard lives and works in Paris.<br/><br/>The two survivors include:<br/><br/>DOUD the HOSPITAL BOY<br/>&ldquo;Hey Mr. Zombie, take these lead pills to ease your terminal pain!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Doud had a spectacular skateboard accident mere hours before the zombie invasion. He awoke in the turmoil, as infected people were turning into zombies and began to attack anyone in sight. His will to live, however, was stronger than the zombie tide. Doud took anything he could find and turned it into a weapon, until he found his first real weapons. He was the one to Molotov the Hospital Central and turn it into a funeral pyre. Despite his awesome feat, Doud still has to be taken care of. Finding medical supplies in a devastated town isn&rsquo;t easy.

The buck, a noble-born soldier, relies on his family name as much as his rifle to assure victory for himself and his squadmates. The courtier plays at being the power behind the throne and specializes in providing support for his lord (a chosen ally) both on and off the battlefield. Finally, the sycophant is a powerful spellcaster whose abilities are derived from his service to another being whom he worships like a god. When used together, they allow a GM to run a more politically-minded game. In such a game, backgrounds are brought to the forefront and combat is married to story. Remember, sometimes it is not about who is killed but who will care if he is killed.<br/><br/>Included: <br/><br/>     The Buck Base Class <br/>         A landed noble with a proper military training. He wields his influence as well as any sword and has a command of both firearms and martial weapons.<br/>    <br/>     The Courtier Base Class <br/>         Courtiers are the power behind the throne. They serve their lord (another player or NPC) and augment their already impressive skills. Powerful in their own right, courtier come from many walks of life and follow many paths (mundane and magical). However, the glue that binds them is their loyalty, cunning, and connections.<br/>    <br/>     The Sycophant Inquisitor Archetype <br/>     Sycophants, obsessive devotees of a charismatic leader, gain enhanced arcane might through their fervor. Eternal yes-men, they see their leaders as being able to do no wrong and fawn on their every word as if it were holy scripture. Sycophants lose a bit of their identities, choosing instead (consciously or unconsciously) to define their existences by their relationships to their leaders.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "162624": {"rpgitemversion": {"246375": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Terracotta Army Extras", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "rpg": {"286": "Savage Worlds"}, "usersrated": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"278": "Culture (Asian / Far Eastern)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "rpgseries": {"24608": "Cast of Cards: On-Call RPG Characters"}, "average": "0", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>If you play Savage Worlds, then you know their slogan: &quot;Fast, Furious, and Fun!&quot; And if you play any role-playing game, you know it's all to easy to get stuck generating characters, filling out record sheets and otherwise doing paperwork.

Players take turns, which typically consist of drawing a card and playing a card. Players will have to play Rainforest habitat cards before they can start to introduce animals to their Rainforest.<br/><br/>Certain habitat cards allow only certain animal categories to be introduced, whereas other habitat cards will allow any animal to be placed.<br/><br/>That brings us to the animal cards. We have included 36 animal cards in the game. There are 6 animal categories, each of which feature 6 animal cards. The category is specified with the help of a small icon.<br/><br/>12 of the 36 animals are in fact threatened animal species, indicated by the red circle behind the animal. Each animal card is worth a certain amount of points. Threatened species typically generate more points than common species. But placing an animal in its favorite habitat will also trigger bonus points, etc. To add some charm, we have included short facts on every animal card.<br/><br/>There is one more card type we have to introduce to you. We have included 12 event cards to make the game less predictable and to help balancing of the game. We believe the event cards are also a great way to add some extra emotion to the game.<br/><br/>The game ends when one of the players introduces a 10th species to his or her rainforest, at which time the point total of both players is calculated.<br/><br/>"}, "162664": {"rpgitemversion": {"246433": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Dimensioni Arcane", "rpgproducer": {"76743": "Davide Capraro"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2199651.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"25501": "Dimensioni"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2199651_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>The basic handbook of Dimensioni RPG lacks a section about magic: this supplement, Dimensioni Arcane, adds it to the game.<br/><br/>This magic system is flexible, as there's no pre-made spell to learn or choose cast but players are allowed to create their own spells by tapping one of four magical domains (elemental, vital, dimensional, alchemical) and mixing their subdomains by their needs.<br/><br/>"}, "162665": {"rpg": {"11105": "Dungeon World"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Dungeon World Missing Paths: Alchemist", "rpgproducer": {"29416": "Steven D.

The mayor hires several companies to build the network as a joint project, including yours! Naturally, you&rsquo;re trying to take the most credit for the network&rsquo;s success. Complete routes with a variety of buildings to earn credit! Achieve your secret objectives to win extra credit at the end of the game. The player with the most credit wins!<br/><br/>How to Play:<br/>Each player has their own personal color-coded deck of Rail Cards. Each Rail Card features two lines and two terminals in various combinations, thus all presenting six different outlets with varying connections or dead ends amongst them. Each card also features two different buildings, each situated on either of the two lines. (There are five different types of buildings.)<br/><br/>Players take turns laying down one card at a time, adjacent to existing cards, to build the map of the city. Cards must be placed in a &quot;brick&quot; pattern. If placed so that the short sides are adjacent to one another, the cards must be in a straight line. However, if placed so that the long sides are adjacent to one another, the cards must be off-set. In this manner, a single card may have up to six adjacent cards.<br/><br/>There is another limit to placement: Cards may not be placed outside of the city limits. This is a final shape of the city determined by the number of players. Though you know what shape the city will take at the end of the game, there is no &quot;board&quot; which predefines the &quot;center&quot; of the city. The city grows and shifts with each new card played. Controlling the growth and logic of the city is fundamental to strategic play.<br/><br/>Scoring and Victory:<br/>Score score &quot;credit&quot; by having the most segments of your color comprising a complete route. A route is complete when it is capped at both ends by a terminal or when it is made into a loop. Score 1 credit for each different type of building on a complete route.

Games people Play is a board game that dares you to go on a quest within the self to uncover your spiritual path. It will take you into the cycles that you encounter in your life and help you to understand how you have evolved. In this world of duality, the system created separation and disconnection within the people. It happened over and over again. Soon, people stopped be-living in themselves and an inner battle began. Chaos, destruction and sadness came into being in the outside world as the human beings became more disconnected and dysfunctional within themselves. Human beings got caught in the cycles that created turmoil within them and peace was no where to be found, until now.  Now the human beings are ready to reach themselves by embracing and uncovering the cycles within the self. They are ready to integrate their hearts and birth a higher perception of themselves.<br/><br/>How to Play :<br/><br/>This is an ancient game of serpents and arrows. The arrows make your energy go up and the serpents take your energy down.<br/><br/>Role a dice and use your marker to move across the board. Read about the number you land on and meditate why you are there and where you are going, and where the synchronicity of the dice will take you. You can start if you throw a one on your dice. Then, the game begins! Use as a board marker something personal that has your energy. It could be a ring, a stone, a crystal etc. As you proceed in the game, you are led to different houses  and  the meaning of each house that you enter into during the game is written in the book that comes with the game.<br/>        <br/>     You win when you became a God-Goddess, the number 68, having perfect control of yourself and using your feminine power with all its divine implications. Meditate on this. Meditate in your circle. You will find this game a beautiful tool to knowing yourself.<br/><br/><br/>"}, "162741": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2755788.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"60": {"name": "Dirk Henn"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamepublisher": {"47": {"name": "Queen Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2755788_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1029": {"name": "City Building"}}, "description": "A new mini-expansion that is part of the Everything Alhambra Kickstarter Campaign.<br/><br/>Contents: 9 tiles.<br/><br/>Setup: All nine tiles are added to the bag along with the rest of the building tiles<br/><br/>Rules: At the end of each round, the Medina tiles are scored after all other buildings have been scored.

For that, you can turn to a mythic heritage. This new aspect of mythic rules allows for further customization of your mythic character. A mythic character can choose a mythic heritage in addition to his or her mythic path, and doing so grants him access to a number of unique abilities that are designed to reflect the flavor of his heritage, while also being of value to characters of every mythic path.<br/><br/>This book centers on the heritage of the Egyptian gods, which represents characters whose mythic power comes from one or more of the deities in that ancient and mysterious pantheon. Characters with this mythic heritage can gain abilities associated with any of the ten deities in the pantheon, and each deity has three such path abilities, for a total selection of no less than 30 mythic abilities. Bend others to your will with the power of Horus, god of the pharaohs. Destroy undead abominations with the power of Osiris, god of the underworld.

During a battle, the player draws a &quot;Foe&quot; card, representing a band they will battle, rolls a four-sided die to determine which band member will battle, and plays Fate cards to boost their chances. The result of the battle is found by rolling a twenty-sided die, plus whatever bonuses from the players own Fate cards, penalties from cards played by other players, versus a score on the Foe card.

The end result, if done well, is a memorable bit of gaming whose highlights are talked about for years to come.<br/><br/>The primary issue with producing this memorable content is that pushing the concept of, &quot;Kill! Loot! Level!&quot; into the background is a ridiculously difficult feat to pull. Players are hardwired for it, some more than others. This means that anything that is meant to pull the player away from this concept must be designed to engage the player in an intriguing fashion and fire upon a part of the mind that is not satisfied by, &quot;Kill! Loot! Level!&quot; In other words, one must design in such a way that the player pushes, &quot;Kill! Loot!

The war is still a popular subject in Japan today, being immortalized by period literature such as the Heike Monogatari ('Tale of the Heike') and live performances by blind biwa (lute) players.<br/><br/>The game is designed for 2-4 players taking the part of one of the four main combatants-the Taira (SW Japan), Kiso (a Minamoto branch, central Japan), Minamoto (SE Japan), and Fujiwara (N Japan). There are rules for a 5th player to operate abstractly as the Insei (retired Emperor) Go-Shirakawa, meddling with the plans of the four warrior houses. There are several different scenarios involving different numbers of players and levels of conquest. Gameplay features area movement of generic land and naval forces. Armies are generic and all have the same value, and are boosted by the values of leaders accompanying them. None of the leaders are named but each has a different skill level (if you're familiar with the history, it's easy to figure out the names that go with each leader counter). Naval warfare and sea movement of troops is somewhat abstract and confined to the southern areas of the map. Cardplay has a big effect on gameplay as cards can lead to possession of the Emperor, abundant crops, famine (denying victory points), access to independent naval forces, and other events. Victory is determined by both provinces held each turn (each province is worth a varying number of points) and enemy units destroyed.<br/><br/>Starting positions for the game are somewhat historically inaccurate; this was done for play balance as the Kiso are facing a two front war with the other combatants initially only having one. Factions are differentiated by their leader and naval pools. The Fujiwara have no navy, three overpoweringly wealthy provinces, and have the strongest leader in the game (and an extremely strong sub-leader). The Kiso have a middling leader, no navy, 23 relatively poor provinces, and a small pool of back up leaders. The Minamoto have a solid and large leadership pool but no navy and start with 14 provinces worth a moderate amount. The Taira have the misfortune of having an excellent leader being a subordinate of the worst leader in the game, but start off with naval forces and 20 moderately valuable provinces. There are also 3 neutral provinces that can be invaded during the game. Overall, the game has a good feel for the war it seeks to recreate and the difficulties faced by each faction.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"246619": "First edition"}, "age": "0", "name": "Genpei Kassen", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "average": "5", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"24940": "Bandai if Series"}}, "162795": {"boardgamedesigner": {"76987": {"name": "Richard Coote"}}, "average": "5", "poll": {}, "name": "Hammered: The Shady Rogue Expansion", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"76986": "Nicholas Coote"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2456": {"name": "The Game Crafter, LLC"}}, "boardgameversion": {"246620": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "expands": {"162792": {"name": "Hammered: The Card-Based Fantasy Pub-Crawl Drinking Game!"}}, "age": "18", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "This is an expansion for the game Hammered where you play as a group of dwarves on a pub-crawl.

The better they do during training, the easier they catch cattle in the field. Be smart and get in your opponents&rsquo; way with mean tricks by snatching the most valuable cattle from under their noses, or swing your lasso to abduct one of their animals. At home, sort your cattle by race and assemble them in herds only to sell them later for as many Pesos as possible.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to collect sets of cattle tiles and sell them. Each cattle tile has a value and a race. A set contains only tiles of the same race, ordered in ascending or descending value. For each race, your cattle tiles are arranged in a line. New cattle tiles are added to the end of the line. When you add a tile that doesn't match the ordering of the existing set, that means that set ends and a new set is started.<br/><br/>Obtaining cattle is done through a worker placement system. Each player has seven Gauchos which can be placed on various action spaces. The most important of these is the Pampa, where Gauchos can catch cattle (which means the player gains a new cattle tile). Other actions include stealing cattle from other players and sorting your cattle (to optimize your sets).<br/><br/>Placing the Gauchos on an action space requires dice. Each action requires a specific value. These dice are taken from the Dice Rodeo. At the beginning of each round, the dice are rolled. During his turn, a player takes two dice from the Dice Rodeo and uses them to place his Gauchos.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, each completed set of cattle is sold. The game ends when the cattle tiles draw pile runs out. When this happens, one more round is played, and then all cattle tiles are sold.

It is a game of strategy and tactics where battles (of perhaps more than one day) are able to be played in a few hours.<br/>The basic unit of control is the battalion (or national equivalent). This is a unit of individual bases (usually around four), where each base represents a company (or squadron of tanks). This battalion-sized unit is called a combat unit. A group of these combat units, usually two to four, is called a battle group.<br/>An example of a battle group is a British armoured brigade, where the individual armoured regiments are the combat units. The four bases within each represent the squadrons within the regiments.<br/>The focus of Lightning War is not on detail (for instance, range bands and armour penetration tables) but on troop types, the training of the soldiers involved and command control.<br/><br/>All troops and commanders have a quality rating from one (worst) to five (best). This is not the valour of the individual soldier, but a measure of how effective they are in combat.<br/>A turn is two hours and a combat unit (battalion) can perform one or two actions a turn depending on the quality of the troops and a die roll.<br/>Battle groups move sequentially between sides &ndash; not one side after the other &ndash; depending on the quality of the troops and headquarters involved.<br/>Combat units can become fatigued once they suffer casualties and commands can become exhausted (once half the units within them are fatigued). The effects of fatigue and exhaustion are to slow or even stop advances.<br/>Bases are usually 30mm by 30mm for micro armour, but other sizes can be used. Place as many infantry figures on a base as desired (four or five seems a good number).

As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.<br/><br/>Spirit Island is a complex and thematic cooperative game about defending your island home from colonizing Invaders. Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects. Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy, and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek for new power, or to spread presence into new areas of the island.<br/><br/>The Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next turn, they build in those lands, forming settlements and cities. The turn after that, they ravage there, bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present.<br/><br/>The islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but may not always do so exactly as you'd hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them (eg) drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight.<br/><br/>The game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts. Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate-history.<br/><br/>At game start, winning requires destroying every last settlement and city on the board - but as you frighten the Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they'll run away even if some number of settlements or cities remain. Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed, if the island is overrun by blight, or if the Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory.<br/><br/>The game includes different adversaries to fight against (eg: a French Plantation Colony, or a Remote British Colony). Each changes play in different ways, and offers a different path of difficulty boosts to keep the game challenging as you gain skill.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"246745": "English first edition"}, "average": "8.4581", "name": "Spirit Island", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "142", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "162887": {"poll": {}, "name": "Scene it?

This spectre does not distinguish between gods and men, all are crushed beneath the feet of what can only be called...The Cataclysm. Five great beings have formed a Covenant to halt the devastation. Battle rivals to prove that you&rsquo;re a commander that The Five need in order to stop The Cataclysm and earn your place amongst their great champions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Game<br/><br/>Phoenix Covenant is a tactics battle card game that fans have called &quot;like Magic meets Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; - and yes, you can believe them. It's far more than &quot;cards on a board;&quot; there's real strategic depth and you're not subject to mere dice rolls at every critical moment.<br/><br/>In this universe, you are a great commander trying to prove yourself as the best of them all in a battle of wills. Outmaneuver your foes and create tactical formations by turning your cards, outwit others with well-timed unit abilities, combos and spells, and outplay opponents by taking advantage of our unique special-summoning Commander cards, directional armor and attack system, and built-right-on-the-field structure cards.<br/><br/><br/><br/>More Details<br/><br/>Commander Units allow players to forward-deploy units against opposing forces. While you can use them for their native abilities or attack power, forward-deploying can turn the tide of a battle. Position-based mechanics augment keyword-based and event-based mechanics seen in card games up to now. Some cards grow in power based on their position on the board, others might protect units next to them, and others might deflect enemy attacks.<br/><br/>The unique square (80mm x 80mm) card units come with a combination of armor and weakpoints. Damage is reduced when a unit is attacked on an armored side, while a unit suffers a critical hit (extra damage) when hit in a weakpoint. You'll need to maneuver and turn your units to attack your enemies' unarmored sides and weakpoints while protecting your own in deadly tactical duels across the game board.<br/><br/>In the Player vs. Player (PvP) head-to-head mode, you test your tactical and strategic might against everyone at once. Choose your army well, learn spells, and consider constructing powerful structures to support your forces. There is also a 2v2 team battle mode for all out there who want to test their skills while bringing a friend along for the fight!<br/><br/>A Player vs. Environment (PvE) cooperative mode is under development, and multiple scenarios are being tested. With it, you will play alongside friends and take on missions that The Five require you and other great commanders to complete.

But it&rsquo;s all about the business value at the end of the day and you know the current IT Manager will not be with the company much longer and are out to prove yourself a worthy successor.<br/><br/>So, you need to generate more business value from the projects than the other contenders for the IT manager position. Each project needs components (databases and stuff) which, in turn, need capacity from servers either in your own data-centre or in the cloud. You already have staff but they are mostly working on other activities so you will need to re-assign some of them when you can afford it. You don&rsquo;t have any spare capacity so you&rsquo;ll need to add some and keep it optimised so you don&rsquo;t waste money.<br/><br/>Finally, the company will not let just anyone run their projects, especially the really important ones.

Unlike most wargaming rules, all the players in Mog &rsquo;93 play the American forces. The Somalis run themselves on &lsquo;auto-pilot&rsquo;, using a simple scheme of die rolls<br/>to determine where they appear and their actions. The Americans check to see if they get hit any time they perform an action based on the number of armed Somalis who have LOS. These rules assume that<br/>you have some basic wargaming experience, as I have no inclination to write out wargaming basics such as what LOS is and what does and does not constitute cover, etc.<br/><br/>The author&rsquo;s basic scenario assumes that the initial stage of the mission is complete: The Delta operators have captured and secured the targets, who have been loaded on the vehicles and sent off on their way back to base. The first Blackhawk has been shot down and crashed. At the beginning of play, Rangers and Delta Operators (and SEAL and air force personnel as well, if you have the figures) are on the ground, trying to make their way to secure the crash site and prepare for extraction. What happens from there is up to the players and the dice.<br/><br/>Each player will control a &lsquo;unit&rsquo; of American special forces soldiers, typically either a unit of Delta operators or Rangers. The term &lsquo;unit&rsquo; is used because you&rsquo;ll have to decide how many models will form a unit &ndash; it can be as large a stick of Rangers (12 models), to as few as two models each if you have a lot of players. My advice to you is to allow each player 4 to 6 models, maximum, as he will need to keep track of ammunition and wounds for each model.<br/>The Somalis will come into play as &lsquo;mobs&rsquo;. A mob will consist of one or more Somali models, armed, unarmed, or a mixture of both. The Somalis are on autopilot. They are moved according to a protocol described herein, but otherwise perform no actions other than to be on the battlefield, assuming to be firing in whatever direction they are facing at any Americans who happen to be in their LOS.<br/><br/>"}, "162992": {"boardgamedesigner": {"6141": {"name": "Dave Schueler"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Mig Alley Ace", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "yearpublished": "1998", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "boardgameversion": {"246902": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"2650": {"name": "Aviation / Flight"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "Early Jet Air Combat.<br/><br/>MiG Alley Ace is a quick and easy jet air combat game, it is meant to cover air combat from 1945 to the start of the missile age.
