Island tourism grew explosively around 1960 and travel agents searched desperately for new paradise beaches. Your travel office asks you to explore new holiday destinations. Your task is to find the best beaches and the most attractive locations.&quot;<br/><br/>Aloha is a nice mix of tile play and push-your-luck. Players are travel reps trying to secure the best beaches by placing sun loungers on beaches as they explore the island. The tiles show a good mix of land and water, with 1-3 golden beaches on most tiles. On your turn, you jump your rep to a new place, then draw a tile. This must be placed adjacent so you can walk straight onto it, otherwise your turn is over. If you walk on, and it has a beach, you have the option of dropping a lounger in your color onto it on its side.<br/><br/>Then you can decide to push your luck and draw another tile. Each time you walk on, you may drop another lounger, but these go onto their sides. When you decide you've done enough or cannot move on anyway, you stop drawing and turn your loungers upright. But if you draw a tile you can't place so that you walk on, you lose all the loungers on their sides back to your pot. The tile still gets placed, and the game has a clever rule. Whenever a tile is placed, it must go where it touches the most tiles. So if the tile is going next to where you stand, sometimes you have no choice, the game forces its placement. But usually you have a few choices and these are crucial to pushing your luck.<br/><br/>Finally, when all the tiles are down, the island is scored. The longest beach gets a 10pt marker, the next a 9pt marker and so on (with rules for tie-breaks). Then, the player with the most loungers on that beach collects to points markers (more tie-breaks). Also, any loungers still in your pot are also worth 1 pt each.<br/><br/>At first, you think you must fight over owning beaches, and try to wrest back control of a beach. But in fact you will only win by occupying several beaches, and often you only need 3 or 4 markers to secure control. Being able to start a beach, get control, then extend it to get most points will win. Players can be unlucky and draw un-walkable tiles a few times, but this means you are not picking the correct places when jumping.<br/><br/>As the game ends, your options reduce, but you should have done your work already. The result is a nice looking island, with lush jungle and bluewater inlets, dotted with lots of loungers.<br/><br/>You have nothing to do till your turn, but if you make the right choices, you should have a winning chance. Knowing when to go one more tile matters, and knowing when to stop. Players with lots of loungers left in front of them can still win, but may have wasted their opportunities.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "10", "name": "Aloha", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Press Your Luck", "Tile Placement"], "average": "5.45115", "usersrated": "131", "boardgamefamily": ["Tropical theme"]}, "20019": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "General Glen", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Point to Point Movement"], "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic264618_t.jpg", "average": "6.33333", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Red Shirt Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic264618.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Modern Warfare"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "General Glen's Combat Rules for Toy Soldiers is the set of rules you need to get your dusty old toy soldiers out of storage.

The 30-60 minutes of game play feature loads of explosive action, a high level of player interaction, a non-sequential order of play, fabulous contraptions, numerous chances to stick it to your opponents in nasty ways and stunning graphics from the artists behind Spank the Monkey and Kablamo. The game contains 64 cards, 50 Gold Coin markers, 2 Bomb Armed markers and a rules folder.<br/><br/>The players of Badaboom take on the roles of wretched goblins in penal servitude under the cruel High Necromancer. Their task is to sit in an explosive-proof dungeon and try reverse engineering, tinkering style, on various explosive contraptions manufactured by their master&rsquo;s enemies. But the task to gain hands-on personal knowledge about what makes the devices go off and what damage they can do is no picnic, and not even a lifetime supply of resurrections can change that. The goblins want out, and the only way to succeed with this is to earn the gold coins needed for bribing their greedy guards.<br/><br/>The fundamentals of Badaboom are quite simple, but there are lots of tricks and tactics that add depth. Basically, the players take turns holding and tinkering with the bomb while striving to do three things:<br/>&bull; Remove valuable mechanisms from the bomb.<br/>&bull; Change the nature of the bomb in a way that is favorable to the current player but not necessarily to the others.<br/>&bull; Make damn sure to stay away from the explosion when the bomb goes off.<br/><br/>This may sound straightforward, but things are made complicated by the fact that any player can steal the bomb during other players&rsquo; turns. And it&rsquo;s very tempting to steal it. Not only do players get to tinker with the bomb when holding it. They may also draw a card from the deck, and as the deck is placed face up revealing the next card, the players know what they can gain by stealing the bomb. This makes the bomb skip and turn a lot during the game, keeping all players on their toes.<br/><br/>To win, players need to perfect their timing, make every card count and, of course, avoid losing their heads.<br/><br/>Reimplemented by<br/><br/><br/>    Big Badaboom<br/><br/><br/>"}, "20041": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Master of Wars", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Partnerships", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1995", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic638752_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Master of Wars Federation"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic638752.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Wargame"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Players operate as two teams.

Now came the time for a whole series of counter-offensive of its own, designed to cut off and destroy the weakened Nazi armies.<br/><br/>The northernmost of these would be Operation &quot;Mars&quot;, aimed at the German Ninth Army around the city of Rzhev, west of Moscow in the winter of 1942. The Soviet plan, the work of the brilliant Marshal Georgi Zhukov, called for smashing the already-weakened Germans with a heavy commitment of tanks and fresh troops. When this first objective had been reached, a second operation, code-named Jupiter, would encircle and destroy the German 3rd Panzer Army to the south.<br/><br/>Despite horrible weather and very rough forested terrain, the initial Soviet attacks went very well. But German resistance stiffened, and as the Red Army failed to make further progress Zhukov reacted by committing more and more men and tanks. Suicidal courage only added to the Soviet casualty lists, and by the time the offensive sputtered to a halt Soviet losses topped 335,000 men and 1,600 tanks.<br/>Little known thanks to Soviet government silence for 50 years, the offensive was designed as a companion to the &quot;Saturn&quot; offensive around Stalingrad. The fact that the offensive was repulsed with heavy losses meant it was not discussed in Soviet accounts of the Great Patriotic War. While the offensive failed to accomplish what the Soviet High Command and General Georgi Zhukov wished, it did provide what the Soviets needed most, a means of keeping German forces of Army Group Center in place while the Saturn offensive in the south ran its course.<br/><br/>Red God of War covers Operation Mars using the same game system as Alsace 1945 and America Triumphant. Game pieces represent regiments, brigades and divisions. Headquarters are vital to activate units and send them into action; supply is also important to keeping your units at full efficiency and players must choose how to allocate their resources.

The Battle of Gergovia was Caesar's failed attempt to wipe out the threat of a large Gallic uprising by isolating and defeating a gathering of the Arverni, plus several other Gallic contingents, under their new chieftain, Vercingetorix.<br/><br/>The Arverni had taken a defensive position in the hill fortress oppidum of Gergovia, a position somewhat similar to (but much smaller than) that that they would take at Alesia but, given the surrounding terrain, a bit more difficult to take.<br/><br/>In a series of short battles that took place mostly below the walls of the oppidum, and probably helped by a topless show from the Gergovian women (really!!), the Gauls managed to drive off the Romans, inflicting on Caesar his only serious loss in his 8 year campaign.<br/><br/>The Gergovia module comes with its own map but uses, mostly, counters from Caesar: Conquest of Gaul, along with a few extra tribesmen counters. It also uses the rules for C/CoG (preferably the 2nd edition (2006), but the original version will work just fine.)<br/><br/>And while the hilltop oppidum of Gergovia is fortified, Gergovia is not a siege assault (for the most part), but a rather disconnected series of attacks, feints and mistakes. The terrain is not overly conducive to linear combat, the approach to Gergovia being fairly steep and somewhat rocky, but Caesar, Roman that he is, has already built two camps and a sunken trench for easy movement.Gergovia is a tough game for either side, as the options and possible strategies are multiple.<br/><br/>Designed by GBoH&rsquo;s own Caesar (Julius, not Sid), Richard Berg and Developed by his House Labienus, Al Ray, Gergovia contains one full map, one small sheet of counters, and all rules needed for the battle (as a scenario for Caesar: Conquest of Gaul).<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Caesar: Conquest of Gaul<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition"], "average": "7.52449", "name": "Gergovia", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["Caesar: Conquest of Gaul"], "usersrated": "49", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Ancient Rome", "Great Battles of History"]}, "20077": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic368807.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Mark McLaughlin", "Fred Schachter"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2008", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Rodger B.

That June he led this Grand Army of over 600,000 men across the Nieman River to begin what he believed would be his greatest and perhaps final triumph: the invasion and subjugation of Russia. As the defending armies fell back before this prodigious onslaught, Tsar Alexander turned to a pugnacious and crafty old warrior to help save his country, his people and his Romanov Dynasty: Marshal Mikhail KUTUZOV.<br/><br/>Kutuzov uses the same basic rules system as found in The Napoleonic Wars, as it has been modified for even more interactive play in Wellington . As with the later title, there are no diplomatic or political rules: other than those which come into play should Imperial morale fall so low as to trigger the desertion of the Austrians or outright revolt of the Prussians. There are no naval rules other than a Russian ability to move between friendly ports and a &quot;Hornblower&quot; Home Card that allows for a Russian invasion on the Baltic Coast). Kutuzov is thus primarily a game of manoeuvre and combat, where players can recreate the sieges and legendary battles made so familiar to gamers as brought to life in such great books as Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace.<br/><br/>As this is Russia, however, not all enemies stand in solid ranks before you. Players must contend not only with their opponents but with Cossack raiders, Polish Lancers, often brutally horrifying attrition, fragile morale, treacherous allies, political events from outside the theatre of war and, of course, &quot;Scorched Earth&quot; and &quot;General Winter&quot; himself, whose scourge effects both invader and defender of Holy Mother Russia.<br/><br/>110 Cards, most with quotes from the actual participants in that great struggle, drive the game and bring to it the flavour of being in Russia during the 1812 Campaign. The Imperials and Tsarists each have mini- &quot;Home Decks&quot; of a dozen cards each to share, thus increasing the chance that events, forces and options that were presented to the original contenders will arise during play. The other 86 cards, which include many &quot;Must Play&quot; political events, however, ensure every playing of the game will be very different.<br/><br/>Kutuzov comes with a campaign game that can last one, two, three or four turns - but which includes numerous mechanisms that can bring the game to a &quot;Sudden Death&quot; ending at the conclusion of or even DURING A TURN.<br/><br/>Mark and Fred, in seeking to deliver more value, variation and enjoyable gaming have provided two other game start scenarios which allow for the game to begin at the commencement of what would be turn two (On to Smolensk!) or turn three (Napoleon in Moscow) of the campaign. A fourth and rather unique method of play allows for two players to each take ONE of the powers from EACH side, in a highly competitive and unusual game of labyrinthine think and double-think. A fifth version allows for two players to play the game using a SINGLE hand of cards each, with &quot;chips&quot; to buy additional cards for their side as the play progresses.<br/><br/>The Campaign and the Scenarios:<br/><br/>&quot;Invasion&quot;: A Turn One game start should see the French and their Allies' military juggernaut smash across the border and attempt to catch and annihilate the Russians before they can mass to defend their Motherland Can the players surpass their historical counterparts?<br/><br/>&quot;On to Smolensk !&quot;: This permits players to avoid the border battles and initial French advances to begin play at a watershed of the Campaign: The Grand Army confronting concentrated Russian forces defending Smolensk immediately before Kutuzov arrives to take command. Will the French advance on Moscow as they did historically or seek victory through an alternative offensive direction&hellip;north to St. Petersberg or south to seize the Ukraine and other southern victory points?<br/><br/>&quot;Napoleon in Moscow&quot;: In this version of Kutuzov the bloody Battle of Borodino has been fought. The Grand Army reposes in Moscow awaiting Russian surrender or at least agreement to terms. The first chill snow of Winter has fallen, harbinger what's to come: should the French remain deep in Russia hoping to conquer the country or is it time to withdraw to better defences for the 1813 Campaign?<br/><br/>In all of the scenarios, the Imperial Powers have an initial advantage in numbers, leadership, Resources, and Morale. They are, after all, an Army that has never known defeat; a superb military instrument, led by the most powerful man in Europe with his devoted retinue of almost legendary Marshals. They face an enemy who has not tasted victory in Battle in nearly a generation, let alone full-scale war of the likes of which Napoleon wages. <br/>The French must take advantage of their superiority quickly, as that will soon dissipate in the immense marshes, unending steppes and fiercely fought over fields and cities of Russia. If they do not or can not succeed, then the advantage slips away to the forces of the Tsar, who, under Kutuzov, will not just be defending Russia, but will be advancing into the outer marches of that yet fragile empire led by their archenemy&hellip; Napoleon.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["GMT first edition"], "average": "6.8678", "name": "Kutuzov", "playingtime": "360", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "200", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Russia", "GMT Napoleonic Wars Series"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Point 2 Point Episode 12 - Rick Young and Mark McLaughlin"]}, "20078": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic228473.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Mark Miklos"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2007", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Rodger B.

The game uses the same system that first appeared in the popular 1998 Avalon Hill card game Atlantic Storm.<br/><br/>The game setting is the naval and air war in the Pacific theatre during World War II. Pacific Typhoon depicts the history of the air-naval battles of the Pacific War with 40 battle cards, each of which represents an historical naval or air battle such as Pearl Harbor, Midway, Surigao Strait, etc. Players compete by fighting a non-sequential series of twenty of these battles. A battle lasts for one round of play, so each player gets to play once per battle. The round-leader starts by picking one of two battle cards (he discards the unpicked one). The chosen battle card determines the year of battle. The battle card is also worth a certain number of victory points and resources to whoever wins it. The round-leader alternates after each battle, and the game ends after 20 battles (when the Battle Card deck is exhausted).<br/><br/>Players are not assigned to sides. Instead, each player has a hand of force cards that typically includes both Allied and Japanese cards. The force cards represent warships, submarines, aircraft, special weapons, and events. Non-event cards have three separate combat values: Air, Surface, and Sub. For example, the battlecruiser Kirishima has combat values of 1 air, 4 surface and 0 sub; the submarine Flasher has combat values of 0 air, 1 surface and 3 sub; the Zero fighter (Sakai) has combat values of 3 air, 0 surface and 0 sub. Force cards are also worth victory points because they can be destroyed in battle.<br/><br/>After the round-leader selects the battle card, he announces the &quot;suit&quot; of battle: Air, Surface, Sub or Combined. Only the combat values in the announced suit will affect the outcome of the battle. In a Combined battle, the combat values of all three suits are added together. The round-leader also announces the time of battle: Day or Night. Some force cards are only playable in a day battle (for example, the aircraft carrier Lexington), a few are only playable in a night battle, but most are playable in day or night battles. The round-leader then gets to play from his hand. He may play on one side or the other (but not both sides together).

When less than 6 people play all agents, including those not directly involved in the game, are considered to be enemy agents.  A player can theoretically capture 15 agents - there are 18 agents in the game, 3 of which are friendly.<br/><br/>Players take it in turns to look secretly at two cards, returning them face down to the space they came from  In so doing the players try an identify and memorise where the agents are on the board.  When a player has discovered the location of a sufficient number of enemy agents he can, when it is his turn, place one of his three capture cards in the middle of the board.  He does this instead of looking at two cards.  In playing the capture card the player is allowed to take any number of agent cards from the board.  He lays these cards face down in front of him without having a look at the front of the cards.<br/><br/>A player that has used a capture card may, before his turn ends, move up to three cards, one at a time, from where they are to any unoccupied space.  This is done without looking at any of them.<br/><br/>Play continues until players have used up their capture cards or believe there are no more secret agents to capture.  At the end of the game all the players turn over their agent cards and scores points as follows:<br/><br/>Captured enemy agents + 3 points<br/>Captured own agents -  3 points<br/>False trails (own or enemy) -  2 points<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the highest score.  <br/><br/><br/>"}, "20100": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic521431.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Gambit 7", "Wits & Wagers Family", "Wits & Wagers Party", "Wits & Wagers: Epic Geek Edition"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Dominic Crapuchettes"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2005", "maxplayers": "7", "boardgameartist": ["Jacoby O'Connor"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Competo / Marektoy", "Magellan", "Morapiaf", "North Star Games, LLC"], "maxplaytime": "25", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic521431_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "25", "boardgamecategory": ["Party Game", "Trivia"], "boardgamehonor": ["2006 Golden Geek Best Light / Party Game Nominee", "2006 Mensa Select Winner", "2007 Games Magazine Best New Party Game Winner", "2007 Golden Geek Best Party Board Game Nominee", "2007 Golden Geek Best Party Board Game Winner", "2008 \u00c5rets Spill Best Party Game Nominee", "2008 Vuoden Peli Adult Game of the Year Nominee"], "description": "Not a trivia buff?

FAB games focus on speed and playability with low-unit density while keeping the history both accurate and exciting.<br/><br/>Volume 1: The Bulge brings you the Battle of the Bulge from December 16th through December 27th. You command the division and brigade level units using the historical orders of battle. You order your forces to key points, and decide how and when to order extra Assets to bolster them. Note that there are never enough of these Assets to give to all the units begging for them, so you need to weigh your decisions carefully.<br/><br/>FAB delivers a new blend of units and decisions to the block game genre: your forces are a mixture of wooden blocks and die-cut counters.<br/><br/><br/>     Blocks: your divisions and brigades are multi-step wooden blocks with printed labels on one side only, with step-losses represented by rotating the blocks. FAB has a new twist on the units in that the pips on the edges of the blocks are color coded to represent troop quality, which can change as a Division suffers losses. Elite Units can lose their edge and become Veteran, while Green Units can harden and become Veteran as they experience the strains of combat. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Counters: Die-cut counters represent (1) additional Assets available to you as the Field Commander and (2) major Events that could have or did occur during the battle. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Assets represent engineers, army level artillery, independent armor and infantry regiments/battalions, and other small units that can be temporarily assigned to the battles that you deem important to your strategy. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Randomly drawn Events provide divisional replacements, air strikes, interdiction teams, parachute drops, and events unique to each battle in the Series. These Events represent unique opportunities which you can use to influence the outcome, although you cannot count on exactly when these opportunities will be available to you. <br/><br/><br/>Another strong element of FAB is the return of Special Actions, which have already been proven in GMT&rsquo;s Europe Engulfed design to give flexible, exciting game play. Special Actions give you tense choices in deciding how and when to seize initiative or interfere with a sudden move by your opponent.<br/><br/>Series Designer: Rick Young<br/>Series Developer: John Foley<br/>Published: 2007<br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     Wargameroom (real-time)<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["GMT edition"], "average": "7.45182", "name": "FAB: The Bulge", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Area Movement", "Chit-Pull System", "Dice Rolling", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Simulation"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "617", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Block wargames", "Fast Action Battles Series (FAB)", "World War 2: Battle of the Bulge"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Point 2 Point 35: FAB Bulge and The Three Types of Wargames", "Point 2 Point 40: WBC 09 Wrap-up", "Point 2 Point Episode 12 - Rick Young and Mark McLaughlin", "The Messy Game Room Episode 23"]}, "20134": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic158273.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Johannes Ackva", "Max Gabrian"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2005", "maxplayers": "3", "boardgameartist": ["Andrea Boekhoff"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Lookout Games", "Z-Man Games"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic158273_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Ancient"], "boardgamehonor": ["2006 International Gamers Awards - General Strategy; Multi-player Nominee"], "description": "Players take on the role of one of three leaders in ancient Rome: Caesar, Pompeius, or Crassus.

Theses Ratings are based on the average number of goals scored and conceded in each match and are the built-in guarantee of accuracy of results. The respective Ratings for the two teams involved in a match are cross-referenced on a Chart to obtain a Goal Rating for each team. These Goal Ratings serve two purposes. Added together they indicate which Elapsed Time Card to use (this controls the average time lapse between potentially dangerous attacks and thus determines whether the match will be high or low scoring), and when cross-referenced against each other produce the number of the Match Card applicable, this Card providing, on average, the correct ratio of attacks between the home and away team. Five dice are used to re-create, with the help of the twenty Action Cards, the important moves in the match. No attempt has been made to simulate every pass and tackle, the game concentrates only on the decisive moves, the &lsquo;highlights&rsquo; of the game. This action is controlled on the Stadium Card which incorporates a playing pitch containing a Mid-Field and twenty lettered Attack Zones for each team and a Defence State Track on which is recorded the current &lsquo;tightness of each team&rsquo;s defence.<br/><br/>Each Action Card lists six attacking options and used in conjunction with the dice rolls determines the development or break down of each attack. The Goal Attempt Cards come into play when a scoring chance occurs but the result of such attempts depend to a large degree on the current state of the opponent&rsquo;s Defence which will need to be probed and confused by the build-up preceding the shot or header at goal.<br/><br/>The Team Cards also show the team&rsquo;s line-up and substitutes, and this is used to keep track of the player currently in possession, receiving or intercepting a pass, committing a foul, etc. etc. Finally, the Timing Chart is used to record the passage of time and to trigger off &lsquo;tactical options&rsquo; which can result in players being pushed forward or pulled back depending on the state of the game. The Referee&rsquo;s Card is consulted in the event of fouls to decide if disciplinary action is taken against the offender, and this also incorporates the Short handed Chart and Substitution Chart.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Lambourne Edition", "Lambourne Games Edition 1996"], "average": "7.22", "name": "Soccer Replay", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Simulation"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": ["Soccer Replay: 1934 Italy", "Soccer Replay: 1938 France", "Soccer Replay: 1950 Brazil", "Soccer Replay: 1954 Switzerland", "Soccer Replay: 1958 Sweden", "Soccer Replay: 1962 Chile", "Soccer Replay: 1966 England", "Soccer Replay: 1970 Mexico", "Soccer Replay: 1974 West Germany", "Soccer Replay: 1978 Argentina", "Soccer Replay: 1982 Spain", "Soccer Replay: 1986 Mexico", "Soccer Replay: 1990 Italy", "Soccer Replay: 1994 U.S.A.", "Soccer Replay: Champions \u2013 A Selection of League and Cup Winning Teams from the 1970's and 1980's", "Soccer Replay: Euroclub 94/5", "Soccer Replay: Euroclub 95/6", "Soccer Replay: The Best Of Europe", "Soccer Replay: Top English & Scottish Clubs 1995/6", "Soccer Replay: Uruguay 1930"], "usersrated": "15", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Football / Soccer"]}, "20166": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Mark Caines"], "poll": [], "name": "Prosperity", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding"], "yearpublished": "1986", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic97768_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Casper"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic97768.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Casper First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From the game rules:<br/><br/>&quot;The main objective is to buy properties at auction, improve them and then sell them through estate agents.

Their goal is to find canopic jars and, ultimately, treasures. The first player to find and secure his treasure wins the game.<br/><br/>The pyramid, which is about to be explored, is built with the help of cards. All of these cards are placed face down in a 6x6 grid. Around half of the grid is built by light cards which cannot hide jars or treasures, the other half consists of darker tiles and are placed deeper inside the pyramid. Every player can spend 5 movement points. It costs 2 movement points to move through an undiscovered tile, but only one movement point to walk across a discovered tile. Players are not allowed to move diagonally and must always show their opponents the way they wish to take. Although moving through discovered tiles is faster, it can also be less ahdny and dangerous as you might not only discover a simple corridor but also a trap. Cards are used to move, look at undiscovered tiles or attack your opponents.<br/><br/>As soon as the first player discovers a canopic jar, the mummy awakes and starts to wander the pyramid. The mummy is moved by the different players and can be used to prevent an archaelogist from leaving the pyramid with a valuable artefact. When the mummy attacks, all items the attacked player has in his backpack are lost and returned to the pyramid.<br/><br/>If a player successfully leaves the pyramid with a jar, the card is taken out of the game and cannot be taken away from the player again. To prevent players from securing their treasures, other players can steal items or attack opponents to make them lose an object.<br/><br/>From the back of the game box:<br/>You are on the verge of meeting the greatest challenge an archaelogists could ever be faced with:<br/>Krimsutep's Pyramid<br/>Legendary treasures are said to be hidden inside the pyramid, but be careful.

The playing board is a plastic tray into which nine tiles (from a set of eighteen) are placed in a random order.  Each tile has four raised pegs on it, each with a different digit (from 0-9) printed on it.  On their turn, each player must construct an equation by selecting at least three adjacent digits (digits may be adjacent both orthogonally and diagonally) that form a valid equation when the proper operational symbols are added (i.e. 347 becomes 3+4=7, 9752149 becomes 97+52=149, 678234444 becomes 678-234=444, etc.)  Only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are allowed.  No fractions or decimals are permitted.  Equations must follow normal sequence (i.e. 97+52=149 is valid; 149=97+52 isn't)and may not contain more than one operation (i.e. 4-1-2=2 is not valid.)  A given digit may not be used more than once in the same equation, and equations must make use of the digits on at least two separate tiles.  0 may never appear by itself in an equation (i.e. 4+0=4 and 5-5=0 are invalid.)  The equation is claimed by placing plastic rings of the player's chosen color (either green or gold) around the pegs of the digits forming the equation.  After the first player's first turn, all subsequent turns must use at least one previously used number.  If necessary, the player forming the equation flips over the ring so used (rings are gold on one side and green on the other), a la Othello/Reversi.  The game ends when all 36 rings have been used, or when no more equations are possible.  Players then score one point for each ring of their color.  Player with the most points is the winner.

The cash is used to buy sets of books (printed on cards) upon landing on certain spots on the board which, when put together, form a complete set of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.<br/><br/>Questions tend to be more difficult than your run-of-the-mill trivia game.  For example: L.Dombrowski of East Germany won the 1980 Olympic Long Jump with 8.54 metres.  How many metres did Ya Uudmae of the U.S.S.R. jump to win the triple jump (within 2 metres)? But questions like this are to 'weight' the game's balance and are easier if the multiple choice option has been used. In any event to guess within two metres is not that difficult.<br/><br/>However, the game is extremely user-friendly:lots of choices from $20 for answering the question as is, to $10 for selecting one of 3 multiple choice answers; this feature enables children to play by  making guesses if need be, which is why the game has been so popular. Children also like the use of play money as well as the multiple choice (guess) option. In addition, players can move around the board in any direction, as long as they don't backtrack. Another feature which makes the game versatile is that it gives a the choice of categories; here non-trivia types can choose spelling, dictionary or true-false, for instance. The game can be set to be short and quick or longer, by changing the objective from saving all the encyclopedia volumes to saving just one or two, or by the setting of a time limit.<br/><br/>Contrary to reviews, the game was not made....for Encyclopedia Brittanica: After inventing the game Norman Golledge approached the Britannica as a marketing strategy. He was the first person to secure the use of their name in such a way; he was allowed to incorporate the Britannica into the finished game and use the phrase 'Encyclopedia Britannica a source of Common Knowledge&quot;. Britannica also bought and sold 5000 games. The CEO of Atari was set to have his company make an electronic version of the game but was ousted when Atari was spun off or bought.<br/><br/>Golledge had 25,000 games made up and sold them out, making it a best-seller in Canada. He sold an option for film rights to Atlantis films, later Alliance Atlantis,who were on the verge of producing a television games show, when they won an Academy Award and were inundated with offers from Hollywood for drama films.<br/><br/>Currently: June 2015; Norman Golledge is considering an updated board game version as well as an electronic or computer version. His Cardboard Game series which was sought after by the trivial pursuit inventors is also under similar consideration. The game at the time was in final testing by Parker Brother's who decided that year to go with more electronic games. Golledge sold a baseball game to McDonald's in the 1980's which created a record then with over a million copies going through the Treat of the Week program in two days. Golledge is also working on a new game: he is an artist and a writer.<br/><br/>"}, "20257": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Scotty Bowden", "Jim Getz"], "average": "7.25", "poll": [], "name": "Chef de bataillon", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1995", "usersrated": "6", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic99430_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Keith Rocco"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["The Emperor's Press"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic99430.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Miniatures", "Napoleonic", "Wargame"], "age": "16", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "Chef de bataillon introduces you to the exciting world of tactical warfare in the Napoleonic period.

The situation is grim. The Soviets are well- supported by heavy artillery and the German line has been steadily retreating, leaving Budapest in grave danger.<br/><br/>On January 1st, the German IV SS and III Panzer Corps launch a surprise attack to rescue the defenders and recapture the city. By January 12th the attack is stalled in the rough terrain to the west of the city. Hitler shifts the focus of the attack from the west to the south-west and continues the attack on January 18th. Although progress is made, Soviet reinforcements pour into the area and the offensive grinds to a halt.<br/><br/>Hitler calls off the attack at the end of January, and by February 14th, after seven weeks of grueling combat, Budapest falls.<br/><br/><br/>By January of 1945 Nazi Germany_s military fate was sealed. There was nothing the German forces in Hungary could have achieved that could have substantially delayed or even mitigated this defeat. That did not deter the German attempt to relieve Budapest. Hitler_s goal in ordering the attack toward Budapest was not the rescue of its garrison, but rather the recapture and retention of the city. The garrison was in fact ordered not to break out but instead to hold and await relief. Few commanders on the German side took the idea of the retention of Budapest seriously, however. Had the relieving German forces gotten to within a few miles of the city, a breakout attempt would probably have been made. Bitter End lets the players explore the tantalizing possibilities.

As GURPS is to role play, Piquet is to wargaming. A system of play for ANY period you wish, the basic gameplay will fit within any period with some basic fundamental differences required by the period.<br/><br/>This game uses specific generic piquet cards to depict when certain event occur on the battlefield. As the author states, &quot;the future is not perfectly known&quot;. With Point of Attack WWII, compare the turn sequence of Advanced Squad Leader, where you know when each phase and subphase is going to occur, and you can plan your attack to take advantage of the rules. Imagine this sequence: I know this unit cannot move to get behind me in time to avoid me shooting 3 times at his other tank before I withdraw. In Piquet, this does not happen as you do not know when the unit will withdraw (nor the real commander on the ground)  for the unit may withdraw now when this card is drawn, or you may wait and bet that your opponent does not get those 3 move cards before you get another withdraw card. Timing is varied, thus your tactics must be sound fundamentally for you to get the results you want.(Think...What are the odds of THAT happening?) Your plan of attack must have enough concentration to avoid the &quot;nothing gets done&quot; effect.<br/><br/>Game includes base Piquet Master Rules, and Piquet cards. Also Point of Attack rulebook and Point of Attack specific cards. Piquet uses a unique play on the d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20 dice in that you change the die you roll for each type of effect. It is not a roll of a d6 add 1, it is instead of a d6 you roll a d8 as a higher die roll is better (more good things happen).<br/><br/>Also the use of Impetus for maintaining whose turn adds some mystery on how the game plays out. Seemingly &quot;up to chance&quot;, if you properly plan and support your troops, the tactics will be rewarded as the greater force maintains (or quality of troops, or quality of leadership also factors in) the &quot;advantage&quot;.<br/><br/>"}, "20281": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1180891.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Afrikan t\u00e4hti"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Kari Mannerla"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2005", "maxplayers": "6", "age": "8", "boardgamepublisher": ["Martinex", "Peliko"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1180891_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Exploration"], "description": "A new version of the most famous Finnish board game, Afrikan t\u00e4hti.

INTRODUCTION<br/>PANZER WAR is a set of game rules simulating World War II armored warfare using 1/285th scale miniatures. Each player assumes command of an Allied or Axis platoon or company. PANZER WAR includes rules covering most weapons, troops and vehicles used during the period 1942 to 1945. Battle action is simulated in a detailed and realistic manner, but with an extraordinary ease of play once the basic rules are understood. Many things that will seem difficult in reading will become almost second nature after just a few games. Once the basics of play have been mastered players will want to include some of the more interesting and complex optional rules dealing with artillery and aircraft.<br/><br/>The Third Edition of the game is distributed for free on the author's website.<br/><br/>The rules were later used as the basis for the Panzer Command PC game by Matrix Games.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English second edition", "English third edition", "First edition"], "name": "Panzer War", "videogamebg": ["Panzer Command: Kharkov", "Panzer Command: Operation Winter Storm", "Panzer Command: Ostfront"], "playingtime": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Variable Phase Order"], "average": "5.75", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "age": "12"}, "20360": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Curtis Mason"], "poll": [], "name": "This is your lucky day", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Memory", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic112458_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic112458.jpg", "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Memory", "Party Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "A game based loosely on the Candybar Game.

The deck has 78 letter cards -- the entire alphabet in each color (red, green, &amp; blue).  Each letter has a point value from 1 to 5, commoner letters with higher values.  Deal 7 cards each for 6 or less players, 6 each for 7 players, 5 for 8 players, and turn up the top of the draw pile to start the discard pile.<br/><br/>In a turn of the Standard game, a player draws 1 from either pile, plays words to the table, and discards 1.  Each word must have at least 2 letters, and all must be of the same color, unless it has more than 1 of a certain letter.  If the word has more than one repeated letter (e.g. &quot;refer&quot;) the second 'e' and 'r' most both be of the same color.  Words on the table may not be added to or otherwise changed.<br/><br/>The hand ends when a player empties his hand, or when the draw pile runs out.  Each player scores: for words on the table, the length of the word squared (e.g. 5 letters =&gt; 25 points); for words in the hand, the simple length of the word (5 letters =&gt; 5 points); and for each card in hand, the value of the card is subtracted.  The game is won at 150 points.<br/><br/>The Advanced game has a yahtzee-like scoring pad.  There is a row for each word length from 2 to 8, and two scoring columns.  The first word scored for each length is written in the Primary column; and further words for that length are simply tallied in the Secondary column.  After a chosen length of time or number of hands, the player with the highest Primary total wins; ties are broken by the Secondary total.<br/><br/>Finally, the Inverse game only scores penalties: at the end of the hand, players total the points left in their hands.

Put your dollars on the line . . . it's time to roll!<br/><br/>The game board is broken into 8 different areas, each consisting of a number of empty 'lots'. Players build lots by paying money and placing a die of the value matching the one shown on the lot's space onto the lot, along with a casino tile of one of 7 colors. Adjoining lots of the same color are considered a single casino. The casino's boss is the player whose die value is higher than any other in the casino. On each players turn, players turn over a new card representing a new lot they get. The card also is one of the casino colors. Any built casinos of the matching color will score both money and VP. Money is earned for each lot in the casino, where each lot may be owned by a different player. VP goes only to the casino's owner. Players can expand their casinos; try to take over casinos owned by other players; make deals to trade lots, casinos and money; or gamble in opponents' casinos to make more money.

It requires a moderately large group of people -- 7 or 8 is barely enough to keep it interesting, 10 is good, and I have seen it played with about 15 players. The object of the game is to try to give clues for words such that some of the other people will guess the answer, but not more than half. Each player writes 5 words or phrases to be clued on individual note cards, along with his name on each card, and passes them face down to the player on his left. Each player draws one card (without looking) from the ones he is passed, then passes the rest of the cards on. Each player will end up with 5 cards from the 5 players to his right. Each player, in turn, becomes the cluer. The cluer chooses one of his cards, announces whose card it is, and gives a clue. The clue can be anything at all, as long or short as the cluer wants, even using part of the answer or clues that are wrong (like &quot;the capital of New York&quot; as a clue for New York City). The one limitation is that the cluer can't give a clue that turns the game into a multiple-choice guess among a few choices, such as &quot;a planet&quot; for Saturn or &quot;a capital in New England&quot; for Providence. After the clue is given, each player (other than the cluer and the submitter) has a short time to write down an answer, and then everybody in turn calls out what they have written down. If nobody gets it right, the cluer has to give another clue. The cluer loses one point for each clue he gives. If anybody guesses it, the cluer tells the correct answer and each of those people score a point. If exactly one person guesses correctly, this is called a &quot;Cluesome&quot; and the cluer gets 3 bonus points. If fewer than half the people guess correctly, then the cluer is done and the next player becomes cluer. If too many people guess correctly, the cluer has failed and must pick another word to clue, and thus lose more points for giving more clues.<br/><br/>"}, "20444": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Pari-Manie", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Betting/Wagering", "Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "1987", "usersrated": "13", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic104303_t.jpg", "average": "5.34615", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Les Entreprises Aub\u00e9 et Khacho inc."], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic104303.jpg", "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Dice"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Pari-Manie is basically a gambling game in which you want to become the richest player and ruin every other gambler aroud  the table.
