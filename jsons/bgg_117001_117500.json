Each of the cards contain two or three questions. To win a card, a player has to answer all the questions (except for the &quot;guesstimation&quot; one) on a card.<br/><br/>The cards are shuffled and two cards are placed, face up, on the table. The front side shows the card's category and what types of questions it contains. Questions come in different levels of difficulty, and there are yes/no questions and &quot;guesstimation&quot; questions where a number has to be guessed. The active player chooses one of the two cards. If they can answer all the questions on it, they win the card, if not, the card is removed from the game. Then the pool is filled up so that there are two cards again, and it's the next player's turn.<br/><br/>A player can have more than one card from the same category. These extra cards can be used to avoid having to answer one particular question, or three from the same category can be exchanged for one from a different category.<br/><br/>For questions marked as difficult, the active player can ask the questioner for a possible answer (which the questioner has to make up), turning it into a yes/no question. Not doing so, however, has an advantage as well: If a player can answer a difficult question without help, they earn an additional turn.<br/><br/>Special rule for the &quot;guesstimation&quot; questions (only when three or more are playing): Instead of trying for a new card from the pool, the active player can decide to &quot;attack&quot; a player of his/her choice. The next player not involved in the attack reads the guesstimation question from the top card of the card stack. The attacked player has to state a number, then the attacker states his/her estimation. The player whose guess is closest to the correct answer may steal a card of his/her choice from the other player; that card now counts as one of their own.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as one player has won one card from each of the five categories.<br/><br/>"}, "117006": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Roleplaying Tips (Issue 19)", "rpgproducer": {"18784": "Johnn Four"}, "image":

The game board features a map of the United States with the American flag superimposed over it and shows the states' boundaries.  Let's say that you grabbed a Georgia card.  You would place your token, either Daniel David Donkey- Democrat, or Edward Elephant-Republican, on Georgia and answer the question.  If you are correct, you win the electoral votes for Georgia.  Then, you would place a Georgia-shaped piece that is either red(Republican) or blue(Democrat) on Georgia to show that you won Georgia's electoral votes.  Your opponent would take a turn and you continue this until one of you reaches 270 electoral votes.  The questions range from American history to pop culture.

In this game a roll of a D6 is referenced to a chart to determine the movement of each horse.  Each horse has a separate card with its movement chart thereon. The charts have three rows of numbers, each for a different section of the track. Turn order is by lane in the first round and then till the finish, turn order is by leader. Lane changes are permitted only as the very first move of a pawn (horse) on its turn.  The first lane change is allowed as a forward diagonal movement of the pawn.  Additional lane changes in a turn are at a cost of one movement point each,  So, if you have five movement points and make two lane changes as the first two movements of your pawn then you can move four spaces forward along the track. There are areas on the track where lane changes are prohibited.  <br/>   A bit of statistical analysis was made by Cincinnatian Howard Hughes in creating the horse cards.  The horse cards reflect the performance of real horses in that those that excel in sprints fair poorly in long distance races and vice versa.  There is no provision for betting in this game.  The components are somewhat primitive, consisting of; horse movement cards, pawns and coin money all punched from a perforated sheet of card stock.  The box art has a beautiful charcoal drawing of a jockey on his horse making their way to the staring gate.<br/><br/>"}, "117059": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Roleplaying Tips (Issue 500)", "average":

After criticisms of the game's handling, the European and North American versions of the game feature revised controls and gave additional content.  The game features officially licensed cars from international manufacturers. Several modes of playing are present, including a training mode and a two-player mode. The game's music, primarily composed by Shinji Hosoe, was published as a soundtrack in Japan.<br/><br/>The gameplay of Driving Emotion Type-S follows general conventions of racing games. The game's physics and controls intend to be realistic and are based on vehicular weight. The player competes in races with other computer controlled cars in order to unlock new cars and tracks. Car settings can be customized, as well as their colors, before each course. The game includes 43 officially licensed cars from twelve Japanese and European manufacturers, including BMW, Toyota, Nissan, Ferrari, Porsche, and Mazda. Fourteen courses are available in total, including real and fictional ones, and one exclusive to the Western versions of the game.<br/><br/>There are four game modes. The &quot;Arcade Type-S&quot; mode is the main part of the game, and allows the play to immediately join a race. Only four cars are available at the beginning of the game, but as the player wins more races, more cars and tracks are unlocked. The &quot;Line Training&quot; mode enables the player to try out any of the tracks and improve their driving techniques, without any computer-controlled car. An ideal racing line is shown in red on the track and becomes jagged when the suggested braking points are approached. This mode features four autocross tracks that do not feature in the other modes. A &quot;Time Attack&quot; and split-screen two-player &quot;Vs Mode&quot; fill out the gameplay.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Driving Emotion Type-S&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "117162": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Super Letter Linker", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"146013": "Web Browser edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2564": "Words"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2165": "Puzzle"}, "videogameplatform": {"5084": "Web Browser"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Click the letter wafers to spell out a cornucopia of words!

One of these is the tree keeper Momaw Nadon. While not as critical as secret Death Star plans or as inspiring as the legend of a farm boy who became a Jedi Knight, rumors of secret groves of bafforr trees give delight to the children of Tatooine and hope to the adults.<br/><br/>The Storm&rsquo;s Edge is a short adventure for the Star Wars Roleplaying Game designed for four 6th-level heroes. It is also suitable for larger parties of lower-level heroes. For larger 6th-level groups, add three thug 4s for each extra hero to the sail barge battle (see Scene 2).<br/><br/>The Storm&rsquo;s Edge is written for the Rebellion era, but you can run it in any era with a little work. In The Rise of the Empire era, Momaw (see Background) may be just beginning to cultivate his bafforr grove, with local gangsters plotting for his valuable land. In the time of New Jedi Order, set the start of the adventure in Mos Entha or even the remote Eidolon Base. Specific details about how the different eras affect Tatooine can be found in the Secrets of Tatooine campaign pack.<br/><br/>This adventure is suitable for any mix of heroes, but having several ranks in a few skills makes the adventure much easier. The Pilot skill makes the adventure more manageable during the eventual maneuvering of the sail barge (see Scene 2), and Gather Information is useful for the cantina encounter in Scene 1. While the Gamemaster (GM) shouldn&rsquo;t discourage nonlethal solutions to this adventure, the scenario does lend itself primarily to combat-oriented classes such as soldier and Jedi guardian.<br/><br/>"}, "117185": {"boardgamedesigner": {"221": {"name": "Robert Abbott"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Auction", "playingtime": "40", "boardgamecompilation": {"20741": "Abbott's New Card Games"}, "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "yearpublished": "1956", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamefamily": {"98": "Traditional Card Games"}, "average": "5.33333", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "boardgameversion": {"148243": "Auction 2002 Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "40", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "40", "description": "Classic card game by Robert Abbott, created in 1956 but first published in 1963's book &quot;Robert Abbott's New Card Games&quot;, later revised and edited in a private run as Auction 2002.<br/><br/>Players have got to bid poker combinations for cards in an open line in the middle of the table - with these cards they should improve their hand and get the best possible poker combination for when the round ends.<br/><br/>Each turn a card is drawn from the pile and added to the line, afterwards there's an open auction - the cards in the highest combination are exchanged for the last cards on the line.

There is no smoke without fire, we say. If any gossip and writings get spread around, there must be some link between what was imagined and reality. Even an authentically candid lie or skillfully disguised fiction bears links with true to life events...<br/><br/>We are breaking the seal on the door to myths and legends, the entrance to a world where magic was commonplace, the gateway to Empires long ago extinct. The memories of them were methodically erased from the public consciousness, and have remained in oblivion for ages. Now, the time has come to take a step through that door leading to a distant reality where lived mysterious peoples and societies, where lived heroes keen on defending their lands until the last droplet of blood. You will find the truth about what happened to that ancient world of magic and why our knowledge of it is so scanty. The game Heroes of Annihilated Empires is a key to that world's door.<br/><br/>Episode One<br/>The first game episode reveals the opposition of the Forest folk, authentic Atlans habitants, and the underground legions of undead. The main game's hero is a young and courageous elf named Elhant , who is destined to become the key figure in the conflict. The game is set in boundless lands of Atlans and far beyond them. On his path, the main hero will encounter love and hatred, friendship and betrayal; he will have to survive through blood-shedding clashes and massive battles. Legions of undead will contrive multiple ambushes; the authentic races of Atlans will not remain uninvolved either. Those include goblins expelled from their caves by the undead, as well as orcs and gnolls - the old-time elven foes - inhabiting Wasteland, the southern part of Atlans.<br/><br/>To assist Elhant, there will come Lana &ndash; daughter of the elven supreme commander, Monfor Bylal. Druids will help him to master magical spells the warrior can't do without in unequal fights against the enemy. The hero will need to garner the support of other Atlans residents, who, in exchange for his help, will fight alongside the forest folk. However, gaining the upper hand in a war when every dead warrior can be resurrected by forces of necromantic magic is not the easiest task whatsoever... And when bloodshed becomes senseless, only the hope of a miracle remains. Our reality is unaware of miracles, but they do happen in the world of magic - and while pursuing such a miracle, the warrior will traverse the lands of other races, each derived from one of the magical guilds that previously made up the great Universum. The ice-clad halls of northern mountains, the weird lands of the mechanicians, the flying islands of the Sun folk... Elhant has a long trip ahead, and the destiny of his people depends on whether he's able to come back on time.<br/><br/>Main features of &ldquo;Heroes of Annihilated Empires&rdquo; engine:<br/>Thousands of units on the battlefield simultaneously<br/>Skeletal animation<br/>In-game terra-morphing.<br/>Use of vertex and pixel shaders.<br/>Revolutionary technology of building modeling based on degrading 3D models.<br/>View in &ldquo;Free Camera&rdquo; mode<br/>Harmonic combination of 3D and 2D elements<br/>Main game features:<br/>Seemless combination of two genres RTS and RPG with a possibility to combine or choose in-between.<br/>Massive battles of armies of many thousand units.<br/>Four unique races.
