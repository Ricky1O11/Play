DramaScape&trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.<br/><br/>This product is a one-floor old west sheriff&rsquo;s office. There are two hitching posts in the south for tethering horses. Usually the sheriff&rsquo;s and deputies&rsquo; horses are hitched here when they are at the office. Wooden steps lead up to a front porch. Sometimes the sheriff will be sitting on the front porch in a single chair, shotgun in hand, usually a sure sign that trouble is afoot.<br/>The sheriff&rsquo;s office offers a lot of opportunities for old west adventure. It just depends on which side of the law the Player Characters are on. For bounty hunters, the sheriff&rsquo;s office is a place to go find wanted posters and put together a posse to go find a bandit worth a reward and turn him in after capture. They might also have to guard him during the night before a hanging at high noon. They might also have a witness who needs protection from criminals who want him dead before a judge makes it town and can hear what he has to say. In either circumstance, the Player Characters need to fend off the sheriff&rsquo;s office with the help of the sheriff and deputies from break out attempts by their prisoners or allied criminals or break in and assassination attempts of their witness.<br/><br/>If the Player Characters are criminals, you can run a reverse scenario. They have been caught by the sheriff and need to figure out a way to get free or have their criminal buddies break them out of prison. Or maybe the Player Characters let themselves get caught, so they could break out of the holding cells and take out a witness in the middle of the night.<br/><br/>Other possible adventures include a dead sheriff and deputies and the Player Characters are suddenly deputized to become the lawmen. An even better twist is if the Player Characters are formally criminals who have been pardoned but only on the condition of accepting these jobs. The Mayor is banking on their bad reputation to keep his town safe. But instead it leads to the town being targeted by their major enemies and even their old allies who think they&rsquo;ve gone soft and turned traitor.<br/><br/>"}, "148022": {"rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "poll": {}, "name": "River House", "rpgproducer": {"36704": "Steven J.

The office next to the living room has a chair and a desk covered with a map and log books. The cabinets have many drawers filed with customs and tax files.<br/><br/>The river house can be used for multiple purposes. If you place it at the side of a river and have a chain stretching to the other shore, it can act as a river lock booth for a tax or customs purpose. It could be placed in the middle of the river as a fisherman&rsquo;s house or a place for a writer to go for seclusion and quiet during the day before returning to his house on the shore at night. Or it could be used as a guesthouse for a vacation of weekend fishing.<br/><br/>The building has more modern brick architecture and window styles, so likely was made in the 1800-1900s at the earliest.

The superstitious townsfolk beg the group to investigate a nearby haunted castle for them. One of the villagers insists that the castle itself is kidnapping people from the village. If the group accepts the heroic assignment, they soon find themselves on the scene at the folly. As they near the fountain, the vines come alive and attack. To make matters worse, the very grass beneath the heroes' feet become animated and joins the attack.

Their normal prescriptions are discarded and replaced with new regimens by the main psychiatrist. He has nurses in the room to observe them for changes in behavior. Sometimes the patient&rsquo;s condition improves or worsens on their new regimens. However, this time around the pharmacist has given the psychiatrist some experimental drugs. They greatly improve the mood of the patients who take them. The pills are highly addictive; however, and the withdrawal causes a plummeting of the patient&rsquo;s mood. The patients demand more of the pills and become violent when denied pills as the supply runs low.<br/>A nurse is strangled to death by one of patients and the psychiatrist locks them in the day room.<br/><br/>The player characters can get directly involved as investigators of the nurse&rsquo;s death or perhaps a trail of drug related deaths in town lead them to the pharmacist and the asylum. When they get to the asylum, they find the patients attacking the door with reckless abandon, trying to get into the main asylum.

The Player Characters could be superheroes that are called in to save the day. But the robbers are merely thug henchmen of a super villain, who has waited for the superheroes to arrive to strike.

The superheroes have to use the cars for cover to get close enough to the super villain to power down the suit or engage the brute in melee and knock him out.

It wasn&rsquo;t always a madman&rsquo;s lair; it was once a large, prominent asylum for the psychotically challenged. Some may call it a home for crazies, but the doctors who resided there considered it an opportunity to test new theories and treatment for the curing of psychosis. This was 24 years ago as the facility was shutdown in 1875 and only the echoes of its past remain.<br/><br/>The Asylum is designed to be placed into any setting based in the Victorian era or utilizing Victorian styling. It is fantasy horror and the applicable setting should have some type of emphasis on horror. If running the adventure in a setting likeJudgement Day where the Player Characters are hunters of supernatural beings, they have been assigned to investigate the goings on outside of Rochester after receiving reports of mutated human sightings during the kidnappings. The goal of the team is simple: eradicate the threat at all costs.<br/><br/>If The Asylum is being placed in an investigative setting, the Player Characters will be assigned to investigate the sighting, in a similar fashion, but their goal should be one of extreme caution. Unaware of the dangers that lie ahead, the Player Characters may wish to monitor the asylum and find an occult spell to handle whatever beings lurk inside.<br/><br/>Adventure to be continued in Savage Insider Issue #9&hellip;.<br/><br/>"}, "148070": {"rpgitemversion": {"220240": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Lighthouse", "rpgproducer": {"36704": "Steven J.

A spiraling staircase descends to the pool and one drink of the waters can prevent death forever. What the local legends fail to reveal is the price. One drink of the pool grants immortality, but sunlight becomes a mortal enemy to the imbiber. This has forced most of the immortals into the dark cave next to the pool, unable to escape the mountains. If the group meets the immortals, they find most of them sad and depressed by their fate. Some immortals have become crazy and filled with hate, wishing only to inflict pain on mortals.

The first thing to decide is whether the streets still use cars on the ground or perhaps are using flying cars. For ground cars, the traffic from the north flows one way south able to only make right turns to merge with westbound traffic on the main road and traffic from the south flows only north and able to only make right turns and merge with eastbound traffic.<br/><br/>With flying cars, traffic changes considerably by adding height to the equation. This makes chase scenes rather interesting, since now traffic signs are likely not red, yellow, green, but instead could have up arrows, green, down arrows to signal a change in height of a story, continue forward at normal elevation, or go down a height of a story. The Player Characters could be involved in a bizarre chase with flying cars as traffic patterns change and cars may be flying at them in their current lane if they don&rsquo;t pay attention to the elevation shift signals whether they are chasing someone or being chased. The chase could even involve the subway station with the flying car entering the subway trying to escape the Player Characters or the Player Characters diving into the subway to avoid pursuit, adding the additional dangers of a massive station, subway tunnels, supersonic subway cars, and people to an already hectic chase.<br/><br/>The chase can also be centered on the tram line, with the Player Characters trying to intercept the tram or prevent others from intercepting the tram, adding another element to the chase scene.

One scenario is a rebellion, civil disturbance, or other riot breaks out in a city. The tyrant&rsquo;s military uses the metro station as a way to transport troops in to quell the disturbance. The rebels start seeing military troops mixing in with normal police and track them to the metro station. The rebellion decides to take over or destroy the metro station in order to stop the military&rsquo;s flow of troops into the area.<br/><br/>The rebels either include the Player Characters or they hire the group of Player Characters as mercenaries to help them either take control of the train or blow up the station. This leads to a massive firefight in the metro station, with the latest batch of troops showing up by train to stop the characters. With the military controlling the train, they bust out windows to fire at the characters, take cover behind the open door, etc. The Player Characters and their rebel allies need to enter through the front gate of the station, taking cover behind the walls, chairs, tables, and other objects and then fight their way up to the raised platform and defeat the soldiers in the train.<br/><br/>Once they get near the train, they can plant explosives to blow it up or they could take control of the train, using it to return to the military base by hacking into its last destination. From there they make an assault on the military base to bring the fight to them.<br/><br/>"}, "148096": {"rpgitemversion": {"220275": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Protocursor", "rpgproducer": {"36704": "Steven J.

This product includes a 360-degree panoramic view of the Tug Ship&rsquo;s bridge.<br/><br/>The Tug Ship is meant to be used in near or far future science games. The Tug Ship is useful as a cargo vessel or a tug ship to grapple objects and pull them through space. Metallic grapple arms are the ship&rsquo;s only weapon and useless when tugging salvage or a vessel without letting go first. This can be dangerous since this subjects the tugged ship to a possible sudden shift in direction from nearby gravitational bodies.<br/><br/>The Tug Ship could be called in to pick up the crashed Protocursor, bringing it into that earlier scenario. This could get the tug ship attacked by the aliens chasing the Protocursor. Their allies could even surprise the captain of the tug ship if they stole the alien vessel to escape the planet. The Player Characters might even want to go back and save the Protocursor by giving covering fire against the aliens on the ground while the tug ship grapples the ship and they escape the planet for good.<br/><br/>The classic scenario with a cargo vessel is a sudden attack by raiders. Raiders will typically use light fighters to attack the most vulnerable parts of the cargo ship, the connectors that hold their cargo boxes in place. When destroyed, this jettisons the cargo boxes into space where the raider ships grapple them and run off. The tug ship can fight the raiders with its grapple arms or try and grab one of the cargo boxes. Most raider crews will then attack the grapple arm to get the cargo box. More vicious slave raiders go after the ship&rsquo;s engines wanting not only the cargo, but also the ship&rsquo;s crew as slaves. This leads to a fight on the bridge and the crew quarters from the slave raider&rsquo;s boarding party. The Player Characters can enter the scenario as either the tug ship&rsquo;s crew or a fighter response team sent by a nearby space station, space carrier, or star port. They have to defeat the raiders and save the tug ship.<br/><br/>"}, "148098": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Naya's Quest", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"220280": "Browser Edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2512": "Surreal"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2165": "Puzzle"}, "videogameplatform": {"5084": "Web Browser"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>An isometric puzzle game by Terry Cavanagh in which the player guides Naya on her quest to see the edge of the world.<br/><br/>"}, "148099": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1797019.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"155177": {"name": "Worker Placement: Cash Is King"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1658": {"name": "Mark C.

The doctors, nurses, and medics need to quickly analyze them and figure out what is wrong. A failed healing check or a complication rolled or card drawn by the Game Master causes one of two effects.

The alien creature burrows into the body, and then bursts forth after an incubation period, incorporating the victim&rsquo;s DNA, resulting in a twisted human/alien hybrid creature. The creature erupting is painful and can possibly kill the character. In both cases, the terrified medical personnel flee, calling the situation up to the bridge.

The repair bay would also make an excellent cargo bay as well for a spaceship, space station, or star port or even a room in a modern industrial facility or warehouse.<br/><br/>One module involving the Repair Bay starts with a cargo freighter hauling back a strange machine. A combination of metal and crystal it is quite unlike anything the crew of the cargo freighter has ever seen. They haul it into a star port or space station and bring it to the repair bay for a sensor scan and possible repair. The engineering crew&rsquo;s initial scan determines that the metal and crystal needed to repair the machine are elements they have never encountered. The cargo freighter is ordered to turn over any minerals they recovered in their salvage operation. The space station attempts to communicate with the crew of the cargo freighter, but get nothing but static.<br/><br/>The Player Characters and a security team are sent in to investigate the cargo freighter. About halfway there, the alarm klaxons sound with lights blinking red, and the bridge relays that the docking area 1 has been sealed to prevent the entire ship from decompression. When they arrive, they find the emergency airlocks clamped down and the docking area sealed. The cargo freighter has a massive tear in the side, as if something cut it apart from the inside. The docking area shows signs of similar damage. Tracks have been cut into the corridors of the station that look like claw prints. They lead to the repair bay. Once at the repair bay, the player characters see a horrifying sight. Creatures of metal and crystal are incorporating machines, mechs, and other drones, growing and expanding. For some reason, they shun bonding with the machine brought back by the crew to the repair bay, but are definitely trying to form a wall of metal around the machine. Its up to the Player Characters to somehow stop these creatures and save the repair bay and likely the entire space station or star port from complete synchronization with the creatures. If the defeat the creatures, they can use any remaining minerals to repair the machine. Once the machine is repaired it whirrs to life, giving a robotic warning about the dangers of the silicon-based life forms in the asteroid field that bond with machines. It then goes about absorbing all of the remaining materials nearby whose origins were from within the asteroid belt if allowed to do so. It tells them that he is made from the same materials as the creatures, the reason they cannot take over him unlike the other machines. The machine requests to be repaired fully (its propulsion systems are down, which caused it to shut down in the field) and then brought back to the asteroid field to continue his vigilance.<br/><br/>"}, "148105": {"poll": {}, "name": "a game of gnome: the garden of seedin'", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "boardgameversion": {"220291": "BrainBox Gaming Company First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "This page does not exist.

We recommend getting the Zip File combo as well (or at least download the PDF Preview) so you can see how the tiles all lay out.

DramaScape&trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Time for a data transfer.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The Power Room and the Computer Room is a triple room map of a power and computer room with a small connecting corridor and security desk in between them. This product includes a 360-degree panoramic view of the Power Room and the Computer Room.<br/><br/>The rooms can either be used together in a set or used on their own.<br/><br/>The Power Room and the Computer Room are intended for use in near or far future science games. These rooms are suitable for use in a starship, star port, or space station as the station&rsquo;s or ship&rsquo;s power and computation centers. The power room can be used in an industrial complex or factory on a planet. The computer room could be used as a server room or secret government facility for storing data on a planet. The computer room could also make an excellent library in a far future game. These rooms could be adapted to a modern setting as advanced cutting edge power stations or data storage for a government or corporation.<br/>The computer room makes a tempting target if it holds secrets.<br/><br/>One scenario is a group of rebels, a rival corporation, or enemy space federation of the government, corporation, or space federation keeping the data a secret make a bold attack on the facility that holds the computer room. They attack the facility by boarding a spaceship or space station or by making a sneak attack on a planet-side factory by attacking it from the outside. Once they get to the computer room, they use their hackers to extract the secret information and then have the hackers plant a computer virus. They then proceed to the power room and shut down the power to remove any automated defenses that would hinder their escape. With the power off, they make their escape with the information.<br/><br/>The Player Characters need to stop the attack from outside or the enemy space marines boarding the ship and then get the power back online. Once they get the power back on, they get a nasty surprise. The hackers put a computer virus into the computer station that activates on reboot. Now the Player Characters need to stop the computer virus from erasing all the data from the memory banks. After all this, the attackers have a major head start but the Player Characters must hunt them down to retrieve the stolen data. This sets up a chase or investigation scene, as they need to try and find them.<br/><br/>"}, "148109": {"rpgitemversion": {"220296": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Cryo Room", "rpgproducer": {"36704": "Steven J.

It&rsquo;s going to be a long one.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The Cryo Chamber is a single room map featuring sixteen cryogenic stasis chambers. This product includes a 360-degree panoramic view of the Cryo Chamber.<br/><br/>The Cryo Chamber is meant to be used in near or far future science games, but could be adapted as a cutting edge high tech lab in a modern game focusing on cryogenics.<br/><br/>One adventure featuring the Cryo Chamber could be that a Xenobiologist requires new samples for research (such as genetics, dissections, etc.). He hires the Player Characters to capture alien life forms, specifying a single life-bearing world in a nearby star system. The Player Characters make their way to the system and must find native creatures to capture or kill as specimens on the life-bearing planet in the system. If they capture the specimens alive, it&rsquo;s worth a bonus from the Xenobiologist, whereas dead specimens are worth the standard fee. Once they acquire the specimens, they place them in the cryo chamber in stasis. The biology of these creatures isn&rsquo;t fully known however. The creatures they thought were dead could have regeneration if not fully cut apart; live specimens could react to the cold by going into hibernation for a time before awakening after a healing slumber, etc.<br/><br/>Another complication could be a power outage in the cryo chamber unfreezing them. When the creatures awaken, they go berserk, attacking the cryo pods from the inside to free themselves and attacking any staff and crew in the room. The Player Characters need to rush down to the cryo room and defeat the creatures as well as repair any malfunctioning systems and the pods themselves.<br/><br/>A twist could be the Player Characters finding a hacked code in the cryo chamber computers that started the power outage. The Player Characters use their communication panel to trace the code to a coded message from the Xenobiologist professor&rsquo;s academy. If the Player Characters do a sensor sweep of the area, they find a small spaceship.<br/><br/>The Xenobiologist is inside the ship and was hoping the creatures would kill the Player Characters and then collect the remaining samples using his student minions without having to pay the Player Characters at all.<br/><br/>If the Player Characters hail the ship, they get no response except for the ship turning and fleeing. Whether they pursue the ship is up to the Player Characters. If they do, a chase scene is started which may end with the Player Characters boarding the ship and the professor and his students in the end surrendering.<br/><br/>"}, "148110": {"poll": {}, "name": "Weltflug: Spiel", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1925", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"10643": "Country: Germany"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1784578_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"25898": {"name": "Edler & Krische"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1784578.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"220297": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"2650": {"name": "Aviation / Flight"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "On the cover written: &quot;Weltflug - Spiel.

If the scientists fall for the bluff, they release the seal and let them into the main lab to deal with the creature. The group can defeat the creature and kidnap it, perhaps bluffing the scientists again by saying they are moving it to a more secure facility within the area.

The game is intended for audiences aged thirteen and older, and has a play time of 15-30 minutes. As in the real Gladiatorial arenas of old, fighting prowess alone is not all that is required for success. The love and adoration of the crowd is no less important if one seeks to triumph in the arena.<br/><br/>This game is played using Attack, Defense, Style, and special Prowess cards which are all used in their own unique way, and are the tools you will use to be victorious in the arena. Enter The Arena is played in a series of trumps that continue until the game end conditions are met. Every turn you can either go on the Attack or Defend yourself against incoming attacks. Properly gauging your opponents reactions and moves is an important part of the game. Each player is sent into the arena with the same &quot;tools&quot; to defeat the other gladiators. How and when you use them is up to each player as the game develops. Augmenting your attacks or defense with Style cards is another integral part of the gameplay. Gaining the favor of the crowd is another potential way to win the game rather than defeating the other gladiators.<br/><br/>Adding another level of strategy to gameplay are the Prowess Cards. These cards have various effects that can be used to increase your chances in the arena and/or hinder your opponents as you battle for victory.<br/><br/>Enter The Arena is designed to be fun, strategic, and fast-paced with the ability for anyone to seize the upper hand at a moments notice with a properly executed combo. Be careful though because leaving yourself defenseless will in turn leave you at the mercy of your foes.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"220330": "English first edition"}, "age": "13", "name": "Enter The Arena", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "average": "5", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "148124": {"rpgitemversion": {"220331": "PDF Version 1.2"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Digital Shades", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1780548.png", "usersrated": "1", "average": "8", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"23499": "Digital Shades"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpggenre": {"164": "Science Fiction (Cyberpunk)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1780548_t.png", "description": "From the v1.2 introduction:<br/>You have this really cool cyberpunk scenario and want to run it, but you don't want to bother with too many rules and thick rulebooks?

Each player has an army which is constructed of 20 &quot;cards&quot;.  Cards come in 4 types -  infantry, the basic human units which can control special areas of the field; ironclads, lumbering metal hulks which can crush infantry by stepping on them and grant victory points if they enter the enemy's side of the field; parts, which give ironclads offensive weaponry or other modifications; and tactics, which give one-time effects like moving units to different lanes or an extra attack for that round.  All cards have an associated action point (AP) cost based on its effects and stats like health, damage, range, and speed.<br/><br/>Each round consists of a few seconds where you can spend AP to play cards, followed by a resolution phase where each player gets an additional card (if you already have five cards in &quot;hand&quot;, then the oldest one is lost), attacks are resolved, units at 0 health are eliminated, and each unit moves toward the enemy side (unless you specifically tell it to stay in place).  AP accumulates at a fixed rate (usually 1 or 1.5 per turn) and can be modified by controlling particular spots on the map with infantry.  The game ends when one side accumulates 8 victory points or, in the case of story missions, achieves some other objective.<br/><br/>The game is set in a steampunk alternate universe Civil War, where infantry fight alongside Ironclads.  The cards are broken into four factions (as well as some neutral cards): Army, Protoype, Mercenary, and Native.  Each faction has unique cards, and a deck can contain up to two different factions.<br/><br/>"}, "148126": {"rpg": {"20439": "BareBones Fantasy Role-playing Game"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Flesh & Blood", "rpgproducer": {"46573": "Bill Logan"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1929964.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": {"220333": "OneBookshelf PDF version"}, "average": "8", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1929964_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>In this official supplement to the BareBones Fantasy role-playing game, you'll find 20 playable character races fully defined.

The active player chooses which person he/she will attack. Then both of them alternately will try to build their own combo to defend and attack. They can ask for help from the inactive players; the cost of helping is negotiable. The longest combo win the battle. Then, the player on the left (of the active player) then proceed as the new active player.<br/><br/>The objective of the game depends on which character the player will have in the beginning of the game.

They want to get the mine stripped of all resources and get out of town, hopefully before the local communities notice. Unfortunately for them, people start getting sick in the nearby mining apartment town after drinking well water. When some of these people die, the miners pool their resources together to hire a group of investigators (the player characters). The player characters need to sample the well water and figure out what is wrong with it. The well water seems to be poisoned by a high degree of sludge, slime, and other silica. The player characters can get to the waste dump by either figuring out where the water comes from that enters the well (such as pre-mining survey maps of underground rivers in the area) or by tailing a waste dump truck if they think to follow it out to the dumpsite. When they arrive at the waste dump, they see a pool of filth and slime that is barely contained at all by a circular rock wall built around it. It looks like a circular dam that might overflow and burst the next time another waste disposal truck arrives. When they go to confront the mine owners, they find them preparing to collapse the mine and packing their bags. They have also hired some mercenaries to cover their egress from town. These mercenaries are located in the towers and building rooftops as lookouts and snipers (or on the walkway as lookouts as well). It is up to the group to intimidate or persuade the mine owners to do the right thing if possible or use force to bring about justice for the town.

It could be used as a cutting edge bunker that was sealed in a modern game as well found later in the future.<br/><br/>The Bunker was sealed to prevent radiation fallout from killing everyone in the facility. However, some of the residents panicked and broke the seal, killing the security guards in 1B (the three skeletons in 1B), turning off the automated security turrets, and used the lift to go to the surface and escape the bunker. Presumably, they tried to survive on the surface, either dying from radiation poisoning or undergoing mutations becoming mutants. The group is trying to survive on the surface of this planet after the radiation on the surface has fallen to safe levels. Mutants live on the surface and are chasing the group. The group finds the bunker with four offline turrets and four open gates. If they can seal the gates, they can keep out the mutants, and if they can turn the turrets on, they can drive them off by loading the turrets with the ammo crates. If they can drive off the mutants, they can try and raid the rest of the facility for supplies left behind such as food or medical supplies. Perhaps the cryo chambers hold some people in suspended animation and can be freed by the group who can explain the history of the bunker if they survive the unfreezing process. For example, perhaps the people in the living area were prisoners and the security guards upstairs were keeping them inside to save them all, but the prisoners were determined to break out no matter what.<br/><br/>"}, "148156": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Exotic Encounters: Mummies", "rpgproducer": {"36376": "Rosa Gibbons"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1781263.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"220378": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"22496": "Exotic Encounters"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1781263_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>This particular installment of Exotic Encounters focuses on the mummy: one of the most iconic forms of undead, though one that is often difficult to reconcile with the medieval European themes of the average fantasy roleplaying game. Though we often think of Egypt when we think of mummies, the fact of the matter is that mummies of various sorts have been found historically throughout the world. For the purposes of this book, we focused on three different aspects of mummies in popular culture. The relic-bound mummy (CR 7) focuses on the concept of mummies as guardians of relics and treasures, and it is virtually impossible to steal a relicbound mummy&rsquo;s relic and live to enjoy the spoils. The curse lord mummy (CR 10) instead focuses on the link between mummies and curses, and is loaded down with some very nasty and creative curses that are incredibly difficult to remove. Finally, the possessed mummy (CR 12) is actually nothing more than the corpse of an ancient warrior, who has been possessed by a fiendish entity, which uses it as a foothold to spread evil and terror through the material plane.<br/><br/>"}, "148157": {"rpgitemversion": {"220379": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Amulet of Dogskull", "rpgproducer": {"18788": "Andy Slack"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1781265.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"14584": "Dread Sea Dominions"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"1013": "Fantasy (Sword & Sorcery)"}, "rpg": {"286": "Savage Worlds"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"14585": "Beasts & Barbarians"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1781265_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>It all begins with a theft in the night, and the jewels of a rich lady.<br/><br/>But there is no honor among thieves, and this crime will lead the heroes on a restless hunt beyond the Godaxe River, only to discover that something ancient and evil lurks behind a door that no one should open!<br/><br/>The dangers of the savage North, betrayals and chases await the heroes in the fifth installment of the Beasts &amp; Barbarians adventure series!<br/><br/>Do you dare take Dogskull&rsquo;s amulet in your hands and face the terrible Howlers?<br/><br/>This scenario includes an extensive Book of Lore dedicated to Northeim and its savage people and customs, plus a small expansion on how to design a Trial of Manhood scenario.<br/><br/>This scenario is for a party of four Veteran heroes, with some experience (40-45 Experience Points is the optimal level), but it can easily be modified, by following the instructions in the Golden Edition, for parties of different sizes and experience.<br/><br/>"}, "148158": {"rpgitemversion": {"220380": "PDF version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Day in the Life: Gaming the Downtime", "rpgproducer": {"68399": "Lee Ballew"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1781266.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"2118": "Shaintar"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"173": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpg": {"286": "Savage Worlds"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1781266_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>&ldquo;Day in the Life&rdquo; sessions allow a lot of different non-combat things to happen in a gameplay style that satisfies the desire to utilize character abilities and gifts while still focusing on deep story development and roleplay.

From the dawn of time, when bands of hunter-gatherers roamed the land, men and women shared a sacred bond with the beasts they hunted. The primal people bowed before colossal statues of wild beasts, and the priests of Yar-Ammon wore animal masks in imitation of their gods. Each beast had its own cult; each city its own idol.<br/><br/>In the city of Khadis, where the hyena was sacred, the Great Red Sphinx was placated every year with offerings of treasure and blood. The people heaped silver and gold at the feet of the sphinx and feasted on the intoxicating wines prepared by the priests. And then the drunken revelers fell upon the city&rsquo;s criminals and prisoners of war and hurled them over the city walls to the hyena packs waiting below.<br/><br/>But things are different today. Before his death two and twenty years ago, the High King of Yar-Ammon instituted the worship of an (until then) unknown god, called the First One, and known variously as Zothur, Zoth-Ur, or Xoth-Ur. Taking the title of Kingpriest and Prophet of the First One, the king sent his new priests from Amenti to all the lesser cities of the land, and demanded that the old ways of beast-worship be abandoned.<br/><br/>The emissaries of the Kingpriest were not well received everywhere, but in Khadis, the petty king Akhtesh had recently lost his queen while she was giving birth to Nathifa, the second of the king&rsquo;s daughters. Akhtesh meekly accepted the Kingpriest&rsquo;s decrees, as announced by the sinister priests of Zothur: As a sign of his will to break with the old ways, Akhtesh was forced to exile the priests of the hyena-cult, deface the Great Red Sphinx, and sacrifice his oldest daughter, Nekhtra, who had been groomed to become high priestess of the hyena-cult since early childhood.<br/><br/>But the king&rsquo;s chief steward, Hykshah, was a secret priest of the hyena-cult. He dressed up a slave-girl as Nekhtra and handed her over to suffer death at the hands of the priests of Zothur, while the real princess was taken into the desert and left in the care of a tribe of wild nomads.<br/><br/>"}, "148162": {"rpgitemversion": {"220385": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Archetypes of the Dominions and Jalizar", "rpgproducer": {"18788": "Andy Slack"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1781011.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"14584": "Dread Sea Dominions"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"1013": "Fantasy (Sword & Sorcery)"}, "rpg": {"286": "Savage Worlds"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"14585": "Beasts & Barbarians"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1781011_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Welcome back to the Dominions!<br/><br/>This supplement gives you thirty ready-to-play archetypes.

Tijdens het spel trekken de legers, onder aanvoering van een generaal, door de verschillende landen. De generaals kunnen onderweg de provinciesteden veroveren. De generaal die het eerst 8 steden heeft veroverd, wint het spel. Bij een treffen tussen verschillende legers kunnen er manschappen of generaals verslagen worden. Een verslagen generaal kan nog wel strijd leveren, maar is verplicht twee manschappen aan de tegenstander af te staan. Wanneer een hoofdstad wordt veroverd dan is het betreffende land niet meer instaat verder te strijden. Tijdens het spel kan een verbond gesloten worden met &eacute;&eacute;n der tegenstanders.

The play area is constructed in a horizontal line using castle and terrain cards, and the turn is divided into four steps: action, combat, movement, and draw. During the action phase, players place new creatures and cast spells. Then, if any spaces contain creatures from both team, they brawl it out. After combat, all friendly creatures move towards the enemy castle with little regard for their own safety. Finally, the player finishes their turn by drawing up to their hand limit.

But here the similarity ends.<br/><br/>Divoshi has five types of pieces, and all of them may move in eight straight directions like the chess queen, but within a limited scope. What is most specific for Divoshi is the rule of pushing/retreat and capture. If a piece enters a square occupied by an opponent piece, the latter is pushed off one square further. If there is no room for the retreat, the piece is captured.<br/><br/>The rules favor an aggressive playing style in which having your own chief under attack usually entails losses.

Maybe it's the first date, or their wedding day, or the moment when they realized they belonged together.<br/><br/>Each player in turn selects a possible 'ship for that character using a card from their hand, narrating as necessary and hoping that the matchmaker chooses theirs &mdash; but if she doesn't, you can always narrate the tale of this destined connection to win the favor of the table and overrule the matchmaker.

In the ruin of humanity, our tools of destruction lie in wait for their next master. As survivors flock to your settlement, they turn their hearts to you to create a future secure from the other savages. Choose your allies carefully and hold your plans close. Maintain dialogue between the other leaders, trade resources, plan coordinated attacks, and promise aid or revenge. It has become clear that only you and your newly formed Security Council can secure this world by suppressing your opponents' ambitions.<br/><br/>A Game for the Nuclear Family<br/>Traditional war games scare away casual gamers. Instead, Security Council presents a diplomacy mechanic that is engaging enough for veteran players &amp; approachable unit mechanics for casuals. Security Council is modular, scalable, quick to setup, intuitive mechanics, self explanatory cards and graphics, and it breeds discussion and post game memories!<br/><br/>Mechanics<br/>Security Council is a tile based modular zone-control, resource management, and diplomacy war board game. Own a war game that makes people laugh, conspire, shout, shake hands, and even flip a table or two. Security Council has reminiscent mechanics to classic war territory control war games but relies heavily on the diplomacy mechanic between players. Trading resources, forging alliances, planning coordinated attacks, and promising aid or sweet revenge is all a massive part of this game.<br/><br/>Command troops in six glorious colors and expand your territory. Build and fire nuclear missiles to rain destruction upon your foes or to buy yourself an insurance policy. You and your friends are the Security Council. As an overview, begin by vying for territory with traditional troop warfare. To some, troop warfare is reminiscent of other war games but is resolved in a different way. Build up your nuke arsenal or nuclear deterrent! Next, fire your nukes or evacuate from your friends nukes! Can you strategically escape the end of days?<br/><br/>Finally, take what is yours in the aftermath of humanity! All that remains are a resemblance of what your armies once were. Will you finally overwhelm your friends? Or will you miscalculate and end on the wrong side of history?<br/><br/>History<br/>Security Council began as an idea where a colleague simply wanted a board game where we could 'nuke' each other. It was sort of a running gag. From the start, I knew I didn't want a game glorified nuclear. The way Security Council plays makes nuking your friends seem utterly devastating as far as a means to progress through the game. Players incorporate a lot of thought into their diplomatic actions around the table and I believe it gives appropriate weight to the issue of nuclear war. Board games are about the people playing it! Truly that is why we play board games, to convene with those around us and Security Council is a medium that creates friends, adversaries, and special moments and memories for you!<br/><br/>That being said, this is not an educational game, per say. Any thoughts formed about nuclear war is all a by product and up to each individual. It is filled with memories of players trying to be friends but enemies too. Many deals are struck and then rescinded when game conditions change. The act of playing with your friends is very fun and after each game new players are always eager to play again.<br/><br/>I began with an existing board from another game.  At the time, I envisioned the game would have it's own unique board.  After some play testing, we saw that a board would create two problems.  First, it would be difficult to balance.  Second, it might limit novelty.<br/><br/>Security Council was successfully funded on Kickstarter.com in December 2015.<br/><br/>Parts List<br/>270 Plastic Color Cubes, 54 Game Cards, 36 Hex Tiles, 30 Factory Tokens, 12 Nuclear Missile Tokens, 1 Six Sided Die<br/><br/>About<br/>Players 3-6, Age 10+, 45-180 minutes, UPC 634041498498<br/><br/>"}, "148213": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2408372.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"12532": {"name": "Mathew Hinkle"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"20661": "Timothy Schleif"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"94": {"name": "Clash of Arms Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2408372_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"2726": {"name": "Age of Reason"}}, "description": "(from the website of the publisher and backcover of the book:)<br/>    <br/>For twenty years, the &quot;Battles from the Age of Reason&quot; (BAR) game series has been the ultimate gaming expression of mid-eighteenth century warfare.

Choose your adventures, then live through them as the game unfolds. Aided by Corto and resisting Rasputin's attempts to thwart your plans, recruit your own bands of adventurers and get your hands on gold at the end of the story!<br/><br/>Corto is a card-based adventure game that mixes tactics and luck. To set up the game, choose four of the six quests, then place the appropriate quest boards next to one another on the table; each quest (attack the train of Russian gold, research the four aces of whale bones, meet the leopard-men, etc.) has its own deck of character and object cards that's shuffled and placed on the left side of the board. Reveal the top character from each deck, take turns placing one of your tokens on any character, then draw four cards from any combination of decks for your starting hand.<br/><br/>On a turn, you can either discard any number of cards and fill your hand to four cards or you can play 1-4 cards. If you play a character card, place it on an empty space on the quest board of the same color, making sure that it's adjacent to at least one other character. Place a token on the card, then either add a token to or remove an opponent's token from an adjacent character depending on the character's border color (denoting a friend of Corto or associate of Rasputin). You can also play objects on the character to affect adjacent cards. Some characters and objects have long range effects that hit any character in the same column or row. Hit a character that has no tokens, and you remove it from the board, counting it as 1 gold at the end of the game. If you played cards, end your turn by drawing two cards.<br/><br/>Players can also move Corto and Rasputin directly, using them to block spaces on the quest board, claim gold immediately, or eliminate characters.<br/><br/>In addition to having its own mix of characters, objects and advantages, each quest has a different treasure waiting for players to nab. For &quot;The Wreck of the Fortune Royale&quot;, you need to be the first to claim the aces in order to claim all the treasure for yourself; for &quot;Admiral Kolchak's Bullion Train&quot;, if you attack the train &mdash; which moves across the quest boards as players lay down cards &mdash; you claim one of the train car tokens, which might have gold on it; for &quot;On the Track of the Leopard Men&quot;, whoever has a majority of tokens on certain characters at the end of the game gains control of markers that might enhance their network of characters.<br/><br/>When two quests are fully occupied or the players run out of cards, the game ends. In addition to scoring for the gold and treasures they've collected during the game, each player scores 2 gold per character in the largest group of characters he controls and 1 gold per character for smaller groups. Whoever ends up with the most gold wins!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"220619": "English/French first edition"}, "name": "Corto", "playingtime": "40", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "232", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "average": "6.65931"}, "148232": {"rpgitemversion": {"220620": "PDF version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "In the Name of Progress", "rpgproducer": {"32917": "Umberto Pignatelli"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1783401.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"17384": "Nemezis"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"951": "Occult"}, "rpg": {"286": "Savage Worlds"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1783401_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>A old friend is missing.

If you&rsquo;re gonna win, you&rsquo;re gonna do it within an hour or two.

You never know what to expect when you sit down in front of Tower of Guns.<br/> - CRAZY POWERUPS: You&rsquo;ve played first person shooters where you can double jump, but have you played any game where you can centuple-jump? You can in Tower of Guns, with the right items.<br/> - GUN-MODIFYING MADNESS: A gun and its qualities aren&rsquo;t tied together in Tower of Guns. Do you like rocket launchers? You&rsquo;ll like them more if you&rsquo;re lucky enough to stumble upon a &ldquo;shotgun&rdquo; modifier. A rocket-launching shotgun is very satisfying.<br/> - OLD-SCHOOL TACTICS: For the fans of the faster shooters, it&rsquo;s all back: circle strafing, bunny hopping, rocket jumping. Tower of Guns is all about moving fast!<br/> - NO LIMIT LEVEL DESIGN: Hate invisible blocking walls that keep you from exploring a cool vista? I do. They&rsquo;re outlawed in Tower of Guns.

The Axis forces in the path of the Allied advance occupy well-prepared strongpoints, and lurking somewhere behind them are the German panzers &ndash; and Rommel, &ldquo;The Desert Fox.&rdquo;  The next three days of battle will decide the course of the war in the desert for months to come.<br/><br/>Utilizing a new and streamlined version of the &ldquo;area-impulse&rdquo; system players will experience the uncertainty of the desert battlefield.  Each turn will contain a variable number of impulses, and both players will be challenged to determine whether it is better to attack first, or defend and then counter-attack.  Having committed one&rsquo;s infantry and armor to battle, artillery support may or may not be available.  To win the Allied player must exploit his numerical edge in armor and artillery, plus airpower, to capture Axis positions and destroy German units.  The Axis player must exploit his greater speed, operational flexibility and superior battlefield recovery, to recapture lost ground and destroy Allied units.  Fast, furious, and chess-like, this is a game for players who love concentrated action!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"266556": "Command Japan edition"}, "name": "Operation Battleaxe:  Wavell vs. Rommel, 1941", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2021": "Area-Impulse"}, "average": "7.35571", "usersrated": "70", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "age": "12"}, "148265": {"boardgamedesigner": {"70879": {"name": "Michael Volkin"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Life in the Fast Lane", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2048": "Pattern Building"}, "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "boardgameversion": {"220659": "English first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "16", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Life in the Fast Lane is a real-time card game playable only with the Strength Stack 52: Bodyweight Exercise Cards deck or with another deck of numbered cards.

Those ships drilled, mined and transported raw minerals from faraway planetary systems back to Earth. Soon hundreds upon hundreds of star systems were visited and their planets were drilled down to their cores and stripped of valuable resources. After the ships moved on to the next system, the leftover excavation installations still lingered as a grim sign of past mining operations. In no time, two corporations monopolized the galaxy mining business, but with myriad systems to exploit they remained in a state of uneasy peace &mdash; a peace about to be broken due to an automated analysis of reports from a system mined many decades ago that yielded something weird, that led to a discovery of...Metallum.<br/><br/>This new substance, which seems to carry a promise for interstellar travel for living organisms, is bound to stir conflict. The Earth Government immediately steps in and claims ownership of the system in the name of the &quot;good of mankind&quot;, but it's clear that one of the two corporations will be afforded the exclusive rights to extract Metallum &ndash; and the huge profits that come with it. The tension raises instantly. Outright corporate war is avoided only thanks to a promise to grant the mining rights to the corporation that will develop more efficient mining infrastructure on the planets. Incidents are bound to happen with old installations used to destroy enemy Extractors since it's clear that the Earth Government will be handing their grants based on Metallum extraction rates of each corporation before finally awarding exclusive mining rights to one of them. The best pilots from each corporation sit down behind their consoles as their factory ships approach the system with production of Extractors set to maximum.<br/><br/>Metallum is a strategy game for two players who take on roles of corporate pilots charged with the task of directing their factory ships in order to construct a more efficient mining network on the system's planets than their opponent does. Each round consists of three main phases:<br/><br/><br/>     Programming: Players simultaneously create a program by composing puzzle-like subroutines that activate various systems on the factory ship (engines for moving, production for deploying Extractors, etc.). Some of the more powerful subroutines take more time to execute and hence impede your ability to react to the other player's moves &mdash; and they might even prevent you from activating other ship systems.<br/>     Action: Players execute programs composed during the programming phase. Since the order of execution of subroutines is decided by the player, the same program can yield vastly different outcomes, which leads to many interesting tactical decisions. During this phase new Extractors are also deployed on the system's planets.<br/>     Profits: Players earn credits for the planets on which they have their Extractors depending on who has more of them.<br/><br/><br/>After nine rounds, the pilot who's earned the most credits for his corporation is declared the winner. Will you be able to cover the planets of the system with a network of your Extractors and at the same time disturb the plans of your opponent? Although the conflict is officially only an economic one, the successful pilot needs to know when to strike at a rival's mining infrastructure or make &quot;slight modification&quot; to it. When all is said and done, nobody will remember the details of the struggle &mdash; only the name of the greatest pilot in the history of the galaxy.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"220669": "English first edition"}, "name": "Metallum", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2689": "Action / Movement Programming"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "305", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "average": "7.24931"}, "148272": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"220670": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1784184.png", "videogameseries": {"34841": "Angry Video Game Nerd"}, "videogametheme": {"2277": "Adult / Mature"}, "usersrated": "2", "average": "4", "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1784184_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures is a challenging retro-style platform game based on the Angry Video Game Nerd web series created by James Rolfe.

The narrator asks the doctor to close their eyes then asks all players to open their eyes.<br/><br/>Day:<br/>The narrator announces who died the previous night with a short story (It often becomes a contest to see which narrator can come up with the best stories). If the doctor chose the correct player to protect, the player survives the near death experience and continues in the game. If the player dies they must sit silent, they are not allowed to influence the game.<br/><br/>After the narrator speaks a discussion begins and players begin to accuse each other of being a werewolf. Anyone that is still alive can participate. When the majority votes to lynch someone again the round is over. The accused player is eliminated and they must reveal their true identity.

It has now become a major source of income for the Texan farmers, while at the same time attracting cattle thieves of all kinds.<br/><br/>In Longhorn, the players assume the roles of two particularly feared outlaws: Eagle Perkins and Jessie Artist Byrd. The aim of the game is simple: to steal cattle (and a few gold nuggets, if possible) to see who can amass the most money by the end of the game &mdash; or who can get his opponent arrested by the sheriff!<br/><br/>The game is set up by shuffling the 9 locations and setting them up in a 3x3 grid, selecting 9 tokens randomly and assigning one to each location (if the sheriff token is in play, it must be placed on Nugget Hill), and finally randomly distributing the coloured longhorn cattle meeples to each location, with the number required being shown on each location. The start player then chooses a location with 4 cattle and places the player piece in it.<br/><br/>The game ends in one of three ways:<br/>- If a player takes the sheriff token, they lose immediately<br/>- If a player takes all 9 cattle of any one colour, they win immediately (if they did both in the same turn, they lose)<br/>- If no legal move can be made, the players score; gold nugget tokens are worth their face value and each colour of longhorn is worth $100 for each cow of the same colour still on the board. For example, if the Perkins player has 4 black cattle and 5 are left on the board, each of his 4 black longhorns are worth $500. If there are no black cattle (because the Byrd player has them, or through drought) then they are worth nothing. The player with the highet total wins.<br/><br/>On a players turn, they choose a colour of longhorn present in their location and steal all of that colour. For each longhorn stolen, the player moves the player piece that many spaces and then flips it, to signify that it is now the other player's turn.<br/><br/>If a location is cleared of longhorn cattle, the player who took the last longhorn must take the token present and activate it. Some are positive and some are negative. Once a space is cleared, it can not be moved to in a future turn, though it can be moved through.<br/><br/>"}, "148291": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1791231.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"70700": {"name": "Matthew Ma"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "3", "boardgameartist": {"62596": "Clark Miller"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"8007": {"name": "Victory Point Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "25", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1791231_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "25", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "description": "Trieste, from designer Matthew Ma, is a boxed card game in which three players take on the roles of Thief, Merchant, or City Watch.

Your role as a player will be to step into the boots of a corps or army general. Operating at the highest levels of command, you will not bother yourself with micromanaging regiments or interfering in the affairs of your colonels. Your challenge will be coordinating your divisions to be in the right place at the right time and wrestling with the out-sized personalities of your corps commanders. The rest, as Robert E. Lee might say, is in God's hands.<br/><br/>Grand Tactical: The rules are designed for 6mm/10mm miniatures, with an available conversion to 15mm. One turn is approximately one hour,  1&quot; = 150+ yards, and 1 base = 1 brigade. Basing is flexible, so long as both armies are based in the same manner.<br/><br/>Altar of Freedom is a turn-based game, although the duration of each turn is determined by a variable Turn Clock. At the start of each turn, players secretly bid Priority Points for the opportunity to maneuver their divisions before the enemy. After the secret bidding, players reveal their highest bids and begin maneuvering divisions in order of priority. After each new bid is reached, players roll to remove time from the Turn Clock. The Turn Clock is the strategic center-piece of the game, since players vie for control of the clock throughout the battle. He who controls the clock can manipulate the speed of the countdown. When the clock does expire, the turn ends immediately and players complete some minor adjustments before proceeding to the next turn.

But it appears that you're not the first visitor to Xenos: Find the relics of a lost civilization and the secrets they contain.<br/><br/>XenoMiner is the latest block-building sandbox game from Gristmill Studios. Featured in the Xbox Addicted to Indie promo, Indie Games Uprising 3 and on gameinformer.com, it is available for Xbox 360 and Windows PC, with more platforms to follow.<br/><br/>XenoMiner includes an extensive crafting system and several exciting gameplay hooks. One incredibly fun feature is the ability to walk on walls with gravity-bending boots - players can build bases, bridges, tunnels and mine shafts without regard to any given orientation, which can lead to some mind-bending structures and architecture, as well as many interesting gameplay situations.<br/><br/>Even more exciting, XenoMiner includes construction bots of alien origin that are programmable with scripts and routines, and can be directed to build structures of immense scope or assist in the mining process. Deciphering the language's basic instructions should be an easy but enjoyable task, and we are eager to expand this feature in future updates.<br/><br/>Unlike the other voxel games for Xbox, XenoMiner does not constrain the player to small world sizes; players are free to explore a rich terrain consisting of multiple biomes across a nearly unlimited landscape.<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "148362": {"boardgamedesigner": {"378": {"name": "Matt Leacock"}}, "statistics": {}, "bgaccessoryversion": {"220870": "First edition"}, "boardgameartist": {"14057": "Chris Quilliams"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1804334.jpg", "description": "The Pandemic On the Brink Replacement Deck contains all of the cards from the new edition (2013) of Pandemic On the Brink: 8 Event cards, 8 Virulent Strain Epidemic cards, 7 Role cards, 4 blank cards, 3 Mutation Event cards, 2 Mutation Cards, 1 Epidemic Card, 1 Reference card.<br/><br/>The artwork and card backs of the 2013 version of Pandemic and On the Brink are different than in the original, making the old version incompatible with new expansions like In the Lab.

Each deck consists of three types of cards: Angels, which are your main combat units; Angelic Scripts, written in the ancient celestial alphabet (Malachim) and granting the angels special abilities to assist them in infiltrating the enemy realm; and Pillars, which call up the elements of earth, fire, or water to protect them from enemy attacks.<br/><br/>Each army has a power meter which is charged when either side's angels visit earth. The power meter must be carefully managed if you hope to crush your opponent as your power meter determines your movement and your ability to execute the Malachim.

The first vargouille in this book, the singing vargouille (CR 3) can also cause such a transformation, though in this case, it is done by a haunting lullaby, instead. Singing vargouilles can also unleash powerful and damaging sonic shrieks, and their bite inflicts a curse of silence. These terrors pale before the bloodsucking vargouille (CR 5) however, which does not kiss its victims but instead attaches to them and drains their blood, transforming their victims into wights, whose heads separate from their bodies and become vargouilles when they are destroyed. Finally, the giant vargouille (CR 7) is a vargouille of titanic proportions, with a propensity for swooping down and swallowing human prey whole in a single gulp, and either allowing them to be digested by powerful acid that inflicts difficult-to-heal wounds, or simply spitting them back out again in the air, leaving the victim to fall to his doom.<br/><br/>"}, "148389": {"rpgitemversion": {"220966": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Temple of the Red God", "rpgproducer": {"34268": "Tim Burns"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1786177.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissuearticle": {"151602": "Pre-Order Sections"}, "rpg": {"20489": "Amazing Adventures"}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpggenre": {"169": "Action / Adventure (Pulp)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1786177_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>&quot;Pulp: Hard-boiled detectives, fedora-wearing action heroes, and Steampunk gadgeteers rocketing to battle with their jet packs against bloodthirsty Thule cultists of the Third Reich.&quot;<br/><br/>Tens of thousands of years before our time, in the mythic Thurian Age, the cult of the Red God, the Blood Imperator, spread across the world like a plague, its legions more powerful than the Aztecs and more cultured than the Mayans.

Air units represent groups of 250 to 500 airplanes displayed on screen using 1000+ unique bitmapped images. With 6000+ unique units, 250+ countries, and a global map of 70,200 hexes, World in Flames is the premier World War II grand strategy game.<br/><br/>All 11 scenarios from World in Flames Final Edition are included and they range from the small 5 turn Barbarossa offensive in Russia and the 5 turn Guadalcanal battle in the Pacific, through to the 36 turn Global War campaign which spans all of Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, the Atlantic, and the Pacific. You can play either the Axis or the Allied side or take the role of one of the 8 major powers. Besides solitaire against yourself and head-to-head, you can play over the Internet. The last two modes of play permit team play with up to 6 players (3 per side).<br/><br/>In addition to the full set of rules from World in Flames, Final Edition, there are 80 optional rules. Under the optional rules section you can choose to include the World in Flames expansion modules: Ships in Flames, Planes in Flames, Carrier Planes in Flames, Cruisers in Flames, Convoys in Flames, and others.<br/><br/>This simulation models national production from conveying raw resources over rail and sea lines to factories for the manufacturing infantry, armor, naval, and air combat units. Because oil was so important during World War II, there are separate optional rules for synthetic oil plants and deployment of oil reserves to the front lines. Game units are represented in both armies and corps, aircraft carriers, naval task forces, and the air groups that took part. Everything you need to re-fight the greatest conflict in history.<br/><br/>Two to six players make the strategic decisions that decide the fate of nations.

Here comes the annual retreat for monsters from all hierarchies to sharpen their skills after playing bad guys in a variety of board games for the past year. The most anticipated event, of course, is the legendary lunchtime battle! No one wants to be sent off on an errand to buy lunch for all the others, so brace yourself and fight for your monster's dignity!<br/><br/>In Monster College: Lunchtime Battle, each player chooses one monster from his hand to join the &quot;counting circle&quot; each turn. Based on the die roll and a counting process, 1-3 unfortunate monsters are fingered to buy lunch for others (earning minus points along the way for the corresponding players) &mdash; but these candidate monsters are so childish that in later turns they'll use their special abilities to bend the counting rules in their favor. In the end, the player whose collected candidate monsters show the most overall &quot;hunger&quot; loses the game and must go buy lunch (or whatever else they agreed to before the game) for everyone else!<br/><br/>\u4e00\u5e74\u4e00\u5ea6\u7684\u9032\u4fee\u65e5\u53c8\u5230\u4e86\uff0c\u5e73\u6642\u5728\u5404\u5927\u904a\u6232\u626e\u6f14\u7a31\u8077\u58de\u86cb\u7684\u9b54\u7269\u5011\u518d\u5ea6\u56de\u5230\u6821\u5712\uff0c\u8a8d\u771f\u8907\u7fd2\u5404\u7a2e\u9b54\u7269\u5fc5\u4fee\u6280\u80fd\u3002\u597d\u4e0d\u5bb9\u6613\u6490\u904e\u65e9\u4e0a\u7684\u8ab2\u7a0b\uff0c\u9b54\u7269\u5011\u6700\u671f\u5f85\u7684\u5348\u9910\u6642\u9593\u7d42\u65bc\u5230\u4e86\uff01\u4eca\u5e74\u7a76\u7adf\u662f\u54ea\u500b\u73ed\u7d1a\u7684\u9b54\u7269\u8981\u7576\u8dd1\u817f\u5c0f\u5f1f\u53bb\u5e6b\u5927\u5bb6\u8cb7\u4fbf\u7576\u5462\uff1f\u9019\u5834\u5e74\u5ea6\u4fbf\u7576\u5927\u6230\u5373\u5c07\u63ed\u958b\u5e8f\u5e55\uff01<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"221216": "Multilingual first edition"}, "age": "8", "name": "Monster College: Lunchtime Battle", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "6", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": {"5615": "Monsters"}}, "148492": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1803351.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"41932": {"name": "Michele Esmanech"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"41932": "Michele Esmanech"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1803351_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "description": "In Dystopian: the manhunt, one to four players assume the role of special agents of the Dystopia Police Department (called Sector 9), with the goal of investigating a murder case, finding the criminal, among four suspects and, eventually, catching him, it or her, before he gets away.<br/>The agents will move around the megalopolis of Dystopia, investigating the numerous locations (distributed among districts and suburbs) meeting people, talking to them, gaining and finding hints and leads that make the investigation progress, bringing them closer and closer to the murderer.<br/>Dystopia is a City controlled by two rival Corporations (Varcom and Infracorp), that are in the business of AI-Roids: artificially intelligent robots that live with the humans.<br/>Dystopia features a plethora of many different locations, where the players will have to conduct their investigation.<br/><br/>Dystopian: the manhunt features the following mechanics: worker placement, variable player powers, action selection, network building, cooperative/solitaire play, press your luck.<br/><br/>The players will have to roll dice, and allocate them on their agent's sheet to gain these resources: <br/>1) warrants: to enter a location<br/>2) attack: to respond to an attack from an encounter<br/>3) evade: to hide from an attack from an encounter<br/>4) interact: to interact with encounters or locations<br/>5) analyze: to analyze hints and gain evidence about who committed the crime<br/><br/>Such resources will be used to deal with encounters the players will meet around the city, to advance their agent's abilities, ultimately, to catch the suspect who is found guilty.<br/><br/>The game is divided in 2 stages: the first is the Search, where players have to discovered who, among the 4 suspects, committed the crime; and the second, the Chase, where the suspect tries to hide in Dystopia, and it's up to the agents to seize him (it or her).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"221217": "English first edition"}, "age": "12", "name": "Dystopian: the manhunt", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "average": "6.375", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": {"5611": "Cyberpunk"}}, "148493": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Jaguar Controller", "usersrated": "0", "videogamehardwarecategory": {"2324": "Controller"}, "videogamehwversion": {"221221": "Jaguar Controller"}, "average": "0", "videogamehardware": {"4428": "Atari Jaguar"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3054770.jpg", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3054770_t.jpg", "videogamehwmfg": {"11465": "Atari, Inc."}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>The standard Jaguar controller has a d-pad, three action buttons (A, B, C), Pause and Option buttons.

Find one that suits you and you&rsquo;re ready to play. These characters have been built using a 20-point buy, as many Pathfinder players and GMs prefer it. However, each comes with instructions on how to adjust the stats to a 15-point buy, should your GM wish to use the standard for Paizo&rsquo;s adventure paths.

If a treant is a thinking tree, a dalrean is a thinking flower, and indeed, the spellcasters of this race are noted for their astonishing floral &lsquo;spellbuds.&rsquo; Dalrean, who live exceedingly long lives, are closely tied to the natural cycles of Exodus.<br/>     Prymidian: Prymidians are regal, red-skinned humanoids. Their stately demeanor and formidable build impress other races and their learning follows suit. The prymidians are a communication and language-inclined race, dedicated to scientific reason, research, expansion of knowledge and discovery. Their culture seeks to know all there is to know in Exodus, and to communicate that knowledge to others.
