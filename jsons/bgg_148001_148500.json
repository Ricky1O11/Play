DramaScape&trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.<br/><br/>This product is a one-floor old west sheriff&rsquo;s office. There are two hitching posts in the south for tethering horses. Usually the sheriff&rsquo;s and deputies&rsquo; horses are hitched here when they are at the office. Wooden steps lead up to a front porch. Sometimes the sheriff will be sitting on the front porch in a single chair, shotgun in hand, usually a sure sign that trouble is afoot.<br/>The sheriff&rsquo;s office offers a lot of opportunities for old west adventure. It just depends on which side of the law the Player Characters are on. For bounty hunters, the sheriff&rsquo;s office is a place to go find wanted posters and put together a posse to go find a bandit worth a reward and turn him in after capture. They might also have to guard him during the night before a hanging at high noon. They might also have a witness who needs protection from criminals who want him dead before a judge makes it town and can hear what he has to say. In either circumstance, the Player Characters need to fend off the sheriff&rsquo;s office with the help of the sheriff and deputies from break out attempts by their prisoners or allied criminals or break in and assassination attempts of their witness.<br/><br/>If the Player Characters are criminals, you can run a reverse scenario. They have been caught by the sheriff and need to figure out a way to get free or have their criminal buddies break them out of prison. Or maybe the Player Characters let themselves get caught, so they could break out of the holding cells and take out a witness in the middle of the night.<br/><br/>Other possible adventures include a dead sheriff and deputies and the Player Characters are suddenly deputized to become the lawmen. An even better twist is if the Player Characters are formally criminals who have been pardoned but only on the condition of accepting these jobs. The Mayor is banking on their bad reputation to keep his town safe. But instead it leads to the town being targeted by their major enemies and even their old allies who think they&rsquo;ve gone soft and turned traitor.<br/><br/>"}, "148022": {"rpgdesigner": ["Steven J.

The superstitious townsfolk beg the group to investigate a nearby haunted castle for them. One of the villagers insists that the castle itself is kidnapping people from the village.

Their normal prescriptions are discarded and replaced with new regimens by the main psychiatrist. He has nurses in the room to observe them for changes in behavior. Sometimes the patient&rsquo;s condition improves or worsens on their new regimens. However, this time around the pharmacist has given the psychiatrist some experimental drugs. They greatly improve the mood of the patients who take them. The pills are highly addictive; however, and the withdrawal causes a plummeting of the patient&rsquo;s mood.

The Player Characters could be superheroes that are called in to save the day. But the robbers are merely thug henchmen of a super villain, who has waited for the superheroes to arrive to strike. The parking lot outside could become a battlefield with a brutish super villain throwing cars or a smart super villain in a power suit shooting ray guns at the superheroes. The superheroes have to use the cars for cover to get close enough to the super villain to power down the suit or engage the brute in melee and knock him out. The complication is the number of civilians in the fast food diner as well as the police cordon around the area. The super villain may get desperate and start targeting the police or the civilians, especially if the Player Characters have shown a propensity for heroic saves of innocent bystanders in the past.<br/><br/>The fast food diner also makes an excellent spot for the Player Characters to unwind following a hectic and dangerous scenario and could easily be their local hangout.<br/><br/>"}, "148043": {"rpgdesigner": ["Steven J.

It wasn&rsquo;t always a madman&rsquo;s lair; it was once a large, prominent asylum for the psychotically challenged. Some may call it a home for crazies, but the doctors who resided there considered it an opportunity to test new theories and treatment for the curing of psychosis. This was 24 years ago as the facility was shutdown in 1875 and only the echoes of its past remain.<br/><br/>The Asylum is designed to be placed into any setting based in the Victorian era or utilizing Victorian styling. It is fantasy horror and the applicable setting should have some type of emphasis on horror. If running the adventure in a setting likeJudgement Day where the Player Characters are hunters of supernatural beings, they have been assigned to investigate the goings on outside of Rochester after receiving reports of mutated human sightings during the kidnappings. The goal of the team is simple: eradicate the threat at all costs.<br/><br/>If The Asylum is being placed in an investigative setting, the Player Characters will be assigned to investigate the sighting, in a similar fashion, but their goal should be one of extreme caution. Unaware of the dangers that lie ahead, the Player Characters may wish to monitor the asylum and find an occult spell to handle whatever beings lurk inside.<br/><br/>Adventure to be continued in Savage Insider Issue #9&hellip;.<br/><br/>"}, "148070": {"rpgdesigner": ["Steven J.

The first thing to decide is whether the streets still use cars on the ground or perhaps are using flying cars. For ground cars, the traffic from the north flows one way south able to only make right turns to merge with westbound traffic on the main road and traffic from the south flows only north and able to only make right turns and merge with eastbound traffic.<br/><br/>With flying cars, traffic changes considerably by adding height to the equation. This makes chase scenes rather interesting, since now traffic signs are likely not red, yellow, green, but instead could have up arrows, green, down arrows to signal a change in height of a story, continue forward at normal elevation, or go down a height of a story. The Player Characters could be involved in a bizarre chase with flying cars as traffic patterns change and cars may be flying at them in their current lane if they don&rsquo;t pay attention to the elevation shift signals whether they are chasing someone or being chased. The chase could even involve the subway station with the flying car entering the subway trying to escape the Player Characters or the Player Characters diving into the subway to avoid pursuit, adding the additional dangers of a massive station, subway tunnels, supersonic subway cars, and people to an already hectic chase.<br/><br/>The chase can also be centered on the tram line, with the Player Characters trying to intercept the tram or prevent others from intercepting the tram, adding another element to the chase scene.

The rebellion decides to take over or destroy the metro station in order to stop the military&rsquo;s flow of troops into the area.<br/><br/>The rebels either include the Player Characters or they hire the group of Player Characters as mercenaries to help them either take control of the train or blow up the station. This leads to a massive firefight in the metro station, with the latest batch of troops showing up by train to stop the characters. With the military controlling the train, they bust out windows to fire at the characters, take cover behind the open door, etc. The Player Characters and their rebel allies need to enter through the front gate of the station, taking cover behind the walls, chairs, tables, and other objects and then fight their way up to the raised platform and defeat the soldiers in the train.<br/><br/>Once they get near the train, they can plant explosives to blow it up or they could take control of the train, using it to return to the military base by hacking into its last destination. From there they make an assault on the military base to bring the fight to them.<br/><br/>"}, "148096": {"rpgdesigner": ["Steven J.

This product includes a 360-degree panoramic view of the Tug Ship&rsquo;s bridge.<br/><br/>The Tug Ship is meant to be used in near or far future science games. The Tug Ship is useful as a cargo vessel or a tug ship to grapple objects and pull them through space. Metallic grapple arms are the ship&rsquo;s only weapon and useless when tugging salvage or a vessel without letting go first. This can be dangerous since this subjects the tugged ship to a possible sudden shift in direction from nearby gravitational bodies.<br/><br/>The Tug Ship could be called in to pick up the crashed Protocursor, bringing it into that earlier scenario. This could get the tug ship attacked by the aliens chasing the Protocursor. Their allies could even surprise the captain of the tug ship if they stole the alien vessel to escape the planet. The Player Characters might even want to go back and save the Protocursor by giving covering fire against the aliens on the ground while the tug ship grapples the ship and they escape the planet for good.<br/><br/>The classic scenario with a cargo vessel is a sudden attack by raiders. Raiders will typically use light fighters to attack the most vulnerable parts of the cargo ship, the connectors that hold their cargo boxes in place. When destroyed, this jettisons the cargo boxes into space where the raider ships grapple them and run off. The tug ship can fight the raiders with its grapple arms or try and grab one of the cargo boxes. Most raider crews will then attack the grapple arm to get the cargo box. More vicious slave raiders go after the ship&rsquo;s engines wanting not only the cargo, but also the ship&rsquo;s crew as slaves. This leads to a fight on the bridge and the crew quarters from the slave raider&rsquo;s boarding party. The Player Characters can enter the scenario as either the tug ship&rsquo;s crew or a fighter response team sent by a nearby space station, space carrier, or star port. They have to defeat the raiders and save the tug ship.<br/><br/>"}, "148098": {"poll": [], "name": "Naya's Quest", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Browser Edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Surreal"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Web Browser"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>An isometric puzzle game by Terry Cavanagh in which the player guides Naya on her quest to see the edge of the world.<br/><br/>"}, "148099": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1797019.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Mark C.

The alien creature burrows into the body, and then bursts forth after an incubation period, incorporating the victim&rsquo;s DNA, resulting in a twisted human/alien hybrid creature. The creature erupting is painful and can possibly kill the character. In both cases, the terrified medical personnel flee, calling the situation up to the bridge.

The repair bay would also make an excellent cargo bay as well for a spaceship, space station, or star port or even a room in a modern industrial facility or warehouse.<br/><br/>One module involving the Repair Bay starts with a cargo freighter hauling back a strange machine. A combination of metal and crystal it is quite unlike anything the crew of the cargo freighter has ever seen. They haul it into a star port or space station and bring it to the repair bay for a sensor scan and possible repair. The engineering crew&rsquo;s initial scan determines that the metal and crystal needed to repair the machine are elements they have never encountered. The cargo freighter is ordered to turn over any minerals they recovered in their salvage operation. The space station attempts to communicate with the crew of the cargo freighter, but get nothing but static.<br/><br/>The Player Characters and a security team are sent in to investigate the cargo freighter. About halfway there, the alarm klaxons sound with lights blinking red, and the bridge relays that the docking area 1 has been sealed to prevent the entire ship from decompression. When they arrive, they find the emergency airlocks clamped down and the docking area sealed. The cargo freighter has a massive tear in the side, as if something cut it apart from the inside. The docking area shows signs of similar damage. Tracks have been cut into the corridors of the station that look like claw prints. They lead to the repair bay. Once at the repair bay, the player characters see a horrifying sight. Creatures of metal and crystal are incorporating machines, mechs, and other drones, growing and expanding. For some reason, they shun bonding with the machine brought back by the crew to the repair bay, but are definitely trying to form a wall of metal around the machine. Its up to the Player Characters to somehow stop these creatures and save the repair bay and likely the entire space station or star port from complete synchronization with the creatures. If the defeat the creatures, they can use any remaining minerals to repair the machine. Once the machine is repaired it whirrs to life, giving a robotic warning about the dangers of the silicon-based life forms in the asteroid field that bond with machines. It then goes about absorbing all of the remaining materials nearby whose origins were from within the asteroid belt if allowed to do so. It tells them that he is made from the same materials as the creatures, the reason they cannot take over him unlike the other machines. The machine requests to be repaired fully (its propulsion systems are down, which caused it to shut down in the field) and then brought back to the asteroid field to continue his vigilance.<br/><br/>"}, "148105": {"poll": [], "name": "a game of gnome: the garden of seedin'", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Take That"], "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "boardgameversion": ["BrainBox Gaming Company First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Humor"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "a game of gnomes: the garden of seedin'  is a family friendly game that allows players to build gardens for points or trash opponents gardens.

These rooms are suitable for use in a starship, star port, or space station as the station&rsquo;s or ship&rsquo;s power and computation centers. The power room can be used in an industrial complex or factory on a planet. The computer room could be used as a server room or secret government facility for storing data on a planet. The computer room could also make an excellent library in a far future game. These rooms could be adapted to a modern setting as advanced cutting edge power stations or data storage for a government or corporation.<br/>The computer room makes a tempting target if it holds secrets.<br/><br/>One scenario is a group of rebels, a rival corporation, or enemy space federation of the government, corporation, or space federation keeping the data a secret make a bold attack on the facility that holds the computer room. They attack the facility by boarding a spaceship or space station or by making a sneak attack on a planet-side factory by attacking it from the outside. Once they get to the computer room, they use their hackers to extract the secret information and then have the hackers plant a computer virus.

After all this, the attackers have a major head start but the Player Characters must hunt them down to retrieve the stolen data.

This product includes a 360-degree panoramic view of the Cryo Chamber.<br/><br/>The Cryo Chamber is meant to be used in near or far future science games, but could be adapted as a cutting edge high tech lab in a modern game focusing on cryogenics.<br/><br/>One adventure featuring the Cryo Chamber could be that a Xenobiologist requires new samples for research (such as genetics, dissections, etc.). He hires the Player Characters to capture alien life forms, specifying a single life-bearing world in a nearby star system. The Player Characters make their way to the system and must find native creatures to capture or kill as specimens on the life-bearing planet in the system. If they capture the specimens alive, it&rsquo;s worth a bonus from the Xenobiologist, whereas dead specimens are worth the standard fee. Once they acquire the specimens, they place them in the cryo chamber in stasis. The biology of these creatures isn&rsquo;t fully known however. The creatures they thought were dead could have regeneration if not fully cut apart; live specimens could react to the cold by going into hibernation for a time before awakening after a healing slumber, etc.<br/><br/>Another complication could be a power outage in the cryo chamber unfreezing them. When the creatures awaken, they go berserk, attacking the cryo pods from the inside to free themselves and attacking any staff and crew in the room. The Player Characters need to rush down to the cryo room and defeat the creatures as well as repair any malfunctioning systems and the pods themselves.<br/><br/>A twist could be the Player Characters finding a hacked code in the cryo chamber computers that started the power outage. The Player Characters use their communication panel to trace the code to a coded message from the Xenobiologist professor&rsquo;s academy. If the Player Characters do a sensor sweep of the area, they find a small spaceship.<br/><br/>The Xenobiologist is inside the ship and was hoping the creatures would kill the Player Characters and then collect the remaining samples using his student minions without having to pay the Player Characters at all.<br/><br/>If the Player Characters hail the ship, they get no response except for the ship turning and fleeing. Whether they pursue the ship is up to the Player Characters. If they do, a chase scene is started which may end with the Player Characters boarding the ship and the professor and his students in the end surrendering.<br/><br/>"}, "148110": {"poll": [], "name": "Weltflug: Spiel", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1925", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Germany"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1784578_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Edler & Krische"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1784578.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Aviation / Flight", "Travel"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "On the cover written: &quot;Weltflug - Spiel.

The group might be able to bluff the surviving scientists that they are a security team sent to deal with the problem. If the scientists fall for the bluff, they release the seal and let them into the main lab to deal with the creature. The group can defeat the creature and kidnap it, perhaps bluffing the scientists again by saying they are moving it to a more secure facility within the area.

Base level gives nothing.<br/><br/>Starting player is chosen randomly and each player chooses and places their starting card in front of them; they may search the deck and choose any card between 2 and 7. Play then proceeds clockwise.<br/><br/>On your turn you take a card either from the top of the deck or the top of the discard pile or may pass. If you take a card you must either use it to build on your wall or discard the card. The discard pile is public and anyone may see the order of the cards there, but not change the order.<br/>You can build in two ways, either going up a level or widening the base level. Each card has a value between 1 and 14, with jack, queen and king being 11, 12 and 13 and ace being both 1 and 14 (you choose in each instant). The joker's value is determined by its position.<br/><br/>When widening your base level you may place your card at either end of your wall if the sum of that card and the adjacent card is 14 or less. You may not use jokers in this way.<br/><br/>When building up, you place your card above 2 adjacent cards of the level below, but your card must be equal to the sum of those cards. Jokers may be used as any other card when building up - its value is then determined by those two cards below it. The joker cannot have a value higher than 14, but it can be considered an ace (value 14 and 1) if the lower cards you build on have that sum.<br/><br/>Example: You have a base level of 7, 7, 6, 2 and a queen. You then have the possibility for a level 1 of ace(7+7), king(7+6), 8(6+2) and ace(2+12). Level 2 would be ace(1+13), nothing(13+8=21) and 9(8+1). No further levels is this case.

The game is intended for audiences aged thirteen and older, and has a play time of 15-30 minutes. As in the real Gladiatorial arenas of old, fighting prowess alone is not all that is required for success. The love and adoration of the crowd is no less important if one seeks to triumph in the arena.<br/><br/>This game is played using Attack, Defense, Style, and special Prowess cards which are all used in their own unique way, and are the tools you will use to be victorious in the arena. Enter The Arena is played in a series of trumps that continue until the game end conditions are met. Every turn you can either go on the Attack or Defend yourself against incoming attacks. Properly gauging your opponents reactions and moves is an important part of the game. Each player is sent into the arena with the same &quot;tools&quot; to defeat the other gladiators. How and when you use them is up to each player as the game develops. Augmenting your attacks or defense with Style cards is another integral part of the gameplay. Gaining the favor of the crowd is another potential way to win the game rather than defeating the other gladiators.<br/><br/>Adding another level of strategy to gameplay are the Prowess Cards. These cards have various effects that can be used to increase your chances in the arena and/or hinder your opponents as you battle for victory.<br/><br/>Enter The Arena is designed to be fun, strategic, and fast-paced with the ability for anyone to seize the upper hand at a moments notice with a properly executed combo.

Each player has an army which is constructed of 20 &quot;cards&quot;.  Cards come in 4 types -  infantry, the basic human units which can control special areas of the field; ironclads, lumbering metal hulks which can crush infantry by stepping on them and grant victory points if they enter the enemy's side of the field; parts, which give ironclads offensive weaponry or other modifications; and tactics, which give one-time effects like moving units to different lanes or an extra attack for that round.  All cards have an associated action point (AP) cost based on its effects and stats like health, damage, range, and speed.<br/><br/>Each round consists of a few seconds where you can spend AP to play cards, followed by a resolution phase where each player gets an additional card (if you already have five cards in &quot;hand&quot;, then the oldest one is lost), attacks are resolved, units at 0 health are eliminated, and each unit moves toward the enemy side (unless you specifically tell it to stay in place).  AP accumulates at a fixed rate (usually 1 or 1.5 per turn) and can be modified by controlling particular spots on the map with infantry.  The game ends when one side accumulates 8 victory points or, in the case of story missions, achieves some other objective.<br/><br/>The game is set in a steampunk alternate universe Civil War, where infantry fight alongside Ironclads.  The cards are broken into four factions (as well as some neutral cards): Army, Protoype, Mercenary, and Native.

Their appearance often troubled the Dutch colonial government as they were master of Silat (local martial art) and refuse to bow down to the government. They were called heroes by the local citizens at the time.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Mat Goceng, a local Vrije man, that vowed to always save the weak and drive the Dutch away from his land. He then met Nyi Kencleng, a rich merchant from the land of Pasundan (west Java), and helped her build a Padepokan Silat. A place where everybody can learn Silat for free. Some people then tried to stop Mat Goceng made his dream into realization.<br/><br/>Mat Goceng is a card game that can be played by 3-6 players. The game mechanism consists of deduction (guessing who is the ally or enemy), bluffing (avoid being attacked), card management (to produce the longest hit combo), and persuasion (persuade other people to ask help from you). The active player chooses which person he/she will attack. Then both of them alternately will try to build their own combo to defend and attack.

The player characters can get to the waste dump by either figuring out where the water comes from that enters the well (such as pre-mining survey maps of underground rivers in the area) or by tailing a waste dump truck if they think to follow it out to the dumpsite. When they arrive at the waste dump, they see a pool of filth and slime that is barely contained at all by a circular rock wall built around it. It looks like a circular dam that might overflow and burst the next time another waste disposal truck arrives. When they go to confront the mine owners, they find them preparing to collapse the mine and packing their bags. They have also hired some mercenaries to cover their egress from town.

They capture the miners and tie them up or force them at gunpoint to continue mining and processing the ore. One of the miners escapes and reaches the nearby mining apartment town and requests help. The group forms a posse to fight off the bandits and rides up to the mountains. The bandits ride the rails on mine cars using them as cover and fire their guns at the group. The group is very exposed in the open to gunfire and needs to ride their horses to cover or a worse possibility leap off their horses and use them as cover. A clever group might run and grab their own mine cars to chase the bandits into the mine, having a gunfight while they ride the mine cars to its depths. The bandits jump off the mine car at the end of the rails and then the chase continues through mine tunnels as the bandits move from cover to cover as the group follows them. The chase ends when the group defeats the bandits by capturing or killing them and then they can free the captured miners. When they get back to the mining town, they are rewarded with processed ore or a lower valued cash reward as payment for their services from the miners.<br/><br/>"}, "148155": {"rpgdesigner": ["Steven J.

However, some of the residents panicked and broke the seal, killing the security guards in 1B (the three skeletons in 1B), turning off the automated security turrets, and used the lift to go to the surface and escape the bunker.

The relic-bound mummy (CR 7) focuses on the concept of mummies as guardians of relics and treasures, and it is virtually impossible to steal a relicbound mummy&rsquo;s relic and live to enjoy the spoils. The curse lord mummy (CR 10) instead focuses on the link between mummies and curses, and is loaded down with some very nasty and creative curses that are incredibly difficult to remove.

From the dawn of time, when bands of hunter-gatherers roamed the land, men and women shared a sacred bond with the beasts they hunted. The primal people bowed before colossal statues of wild beasts, and the priests of Yar-Ammon wore animal masks in imitation of their gods. Each beast had its own cult; each city its own idol.<br/><br/>In the city of Khadis, where the hyena was sacred, the Great Red Sphinx was placated every year with offerings of treasure and blood.

Before his death two and twenty years ago, the High King of Yar-Ammon instituted the worship of an (until then) unknown god, called the First One, and known variously as Zothur, Zoth-Ur, or Xoth-Ur. Taking the title of Kingpriest and Prophet of the First One, the king sent his new priests from Amenti to all the lesser cities of the land, and demanded that the old ways of beast-worship be abandoned.<br/><br/>The emissaries of the Kingpriest were not well received everywhere, but in Khadis, the petty king Akhtesh had recently lost his queen while she was giving birth to Nathifa, the second of the king&rsquo;s daughters. Akhtesh meekly accepted the Kingpriest&rsquo;s decrees, as announced by the sinister priests of Zothur: As a sign of his will to break with the old ways, Akhtesh was forced to exile the priests of the hyena-cult, deface the Great Red Sphinx, and sacrifice his oldest daughter, Nekhtra, who had been groomed to become high priestess of the hyena-cult since early childhood.<br/><br/>But the king&rsquo;s chief steward, Hykshah, was a secret priest of the hyena-cult.

Tijdens het spel trekken de legers, onder aanvoering van een generaal, door de verschillende landen. De generaals kunnen onderweg de provinciesteden veroveren. De generaal die het eerst 8 steden heeft veroverd, wint het spel. Bij een treffen tussen verschillende legers kunnen er manschappen of generaals verslagen worden. Een verslagen generaal kan nog wel strijd leveren, maar is verplicht twee manschappen aan de tegenstander af te staan. Wanneer een hoofdstad wordt veroverd dan is het betreffende land niet meer instaat verder te strijden. Tijdens het spel kan een verbond gesloten worden met &eacute;&eacute;n der tegenstanders.

The first player to finish each tour is given Post Position #1, the second #2, etc.<br/>During the racing phase, owners determine if their horses will race, with a fee of $100/horse being paid.  Placings in the race are determined by the post position times the roll of the dice.

If there is no room for the retreat, the piece is captured.<br/><br/>The rules favor an aggressive playing style in which having your own chief under attack usually entails losses.

Instead, Security Council presents a diplomacy mechanic that is intricate enough for wargamers &amp; approachable unit mechanics for new wargamers. Modular, scalable, fast setup, accessible mechanics, self explanatory cards and graphics, breeds discussion and post game memories! Fans of Risk, Axis and Allies, and Shogun love Security Council because they can nuke their casual friends in a game they will actually play!<br/><br/>You are the last remaining leaders of our old world after the final nuclear war. Your nation turns its eyes and hearts to you to create a secure future for the survivors. In the ruins of humanity lie the tools of destruction, our resources and knowledge. Can you discover our lost power and push back those who wish to do the same? Choose your allies carefully and hold your plans close. Maintain dialog between the other leaders, trade resources, forge alliances, plan coordinated attacks, and promise aid or revenge. Can you and your council of allies bring security to this world by suppressing your opponents' ambitions?<br/><br/>You and your friends are the Security Council. You dream of expanding your territory using diplomacy, alliances, and war. Choose your allies carefully and hold your plans close. Can you bring security to this world by suppressing your opponents' ambitions?<br/><br/>&quot;Mechanics&quot;<br/>Security Council is a tile based modular zone-control, resource management, and diplomacy war board game. Own a war game that makes people laugh, conspire, shout, shake hands, and even flip a table or two. Security Council has reminiscent mechanics to classic war territory control war games but relies heavily on the diplomacy mechanic between players. Trading resources, forging alliances, planning coordinated attacks, and promising aid or sweet revenge is all a massive part of this game. Create dialog between players all set in a high stakes strategy theme. If you like conspiring with your friends and orchestrating massive amounts of colorful cube destruction, Security Council is the game for you!<br/><br/>Command troops in six glorious colors and expand your territory. Build and fire nuclear missiles to rain destruction upon your foes or to buy yourself an insurance policy. You and your friends are the Security Council.  Can you bring peace to this world by suppressing your enemies?<br/><br/>As an overview, begin by vying for territory with traditional troop warfare. To some, troop warfare is reminiscent of other war games but is resolved in a different way. Build up your nuke arsenal or nuclear deterrent! Next, fire your nukes or evacuate from your friends nukes! Can you strategically escape the end of days?<br/><br/>Finally, take what is yours in the aftermath of humanity! All that remains are a resemblance of what your armies once were. Will you finally overwhelm your friends? Or will you miscalculate and end on the wrong side of history?<br/><br/>To summarize basic pre-nuclear strategy, before nuclear war your focus is to produce traditional Troops. Secure special resource tiles, build Factories and stockpile a nuclear deterrent. Box other players in to create pressure and force concessions. Forge cautious alliances to keep you safe and keep others from growing too strong. Embargo others to keep any one player from monopolizing any Resource.<br/><br/>After Defcon 1, launch Nukes back and forth for a few turns. A good counter to a Nuke is a coordinated nuclear response from you and your allies. Strategically plan your evacuation routes to save the most Troops for your counterattack.<br/><br/>Finally, after all the initial Nukes have fallen, spread quickly. Ultimately, capture enough territories to win or strategically move to block other players and force surrenders.<br/><br/>&quot;History&quot;<br/>Security Council began as an idea where a colleague simply wanted a board game where we could 'nuke' each other. It was sort of a running gag. From the start, I knew I didn't want a game glorified nuclear. The way Security Council plays makes nuking your friends seem utterly devastating as far as a means to progress through the game. Players incorporate a lot of thought into their diplomatic actions around the table and I believe it gives appropriate weight to the issue of nuclear war. Board games are about the people playing it! Truly that is why we play board games, to convene with those around us and Security Council is a medium that creates friends, adversaries, and special moments and memories for you!<br/><br/>That being said, this is not an educational game, per say. Any thoughts formed about nuclear war is all a by product and up to each individual. It is filled with memories of players trying to be friends but enemies too. Many deals are struck and then rescinded when game conditions change. The act of playing with your friends is very fun and after each game new players are always eager to play again.<br/><br/>I began with an existing board from another game.  At the time, I envisioned the game would have it's own unique board.  After some play testing, we saw that a board would create two problems.  First, it would be difficult to balance.

Choose your adventures, then live through them as the game unfolds. Aided by Corto and resisting Rasputin's attempts to thwart your plans, recruit your own bands of adventurers and get your hands on gold at the end of the story!<br/><br/>Corto is a card-based adventure game that mixes tactics and luck. To set up the game, choose four of the six quests, then place the appropriate quest boards next to one another on the table; each quest (attack the train of Russian gold, research the four aces of whale bones, meet the leopard-men, etc.) has its own deck of character and object cards that's shuffled and placed on the left side of the board. Reveal the top character from each deck, take turns placing one of your tokens on any character, then draw four cards from any combination of decks for your starting hand.<br/><br/>On a turn, you can either discard any number of cards and fill your hand to four cards or you can play 1-4 cards. If you play a character card, place it on an empty space on the quest board of the same color, making sure that it's adjacent to at least one other character. Place a token on the card, then either add a token to or remove an opponent's token from an adjacent character depending on the character's border color (denoting a friend of Corto or associate of Rasputin). You can also play objects on the character to affect adjacent cards. Some characters and objects have long range effects that hit any character in the same column or row. Hit a character that has no tokens, and you remove it from the board, counting it as 1 gold at the end of the game. If you played cards, end your turn by drawing two cards.<br/><br/>Players can also move Corto and Rasputin directly, using them to block spaces on the quest board, claim gold immediately, or eliminate characters.<br/><br/>In addition to having its own mix of characters, objects and advantages, each quest has a different treasure waiting for players to nab. For &quot;The Wreck of the Fortune Royale&quot;, you need to be the first to claim the aces in order to claim all the treasure for yourself; for &quot;Admiral Kolchak's Bullion Train&quot;, if you attack the train &mdash; which moves across the quest boards as players lay down cards &mdash; you claim one of the train car tokens, which might have gold on it; for &quot;On the Track of the Leopard Men&quot;, whoever has a majority of tokens on certain characters at the end of the game gains control of markers that might enhance their network of characters.<br/><br/>When two quests are fully occupied or the players run out of cards, the game ends. In addition to scoring for the gold and treasures they've collected during the game, each player scores 2 gold per character in the largest group of characters he controls and 1 gold per character for smaller groups.

Those ships drilled, mined and transported raw minerals from faraway planetary systems back to Earth. Soon hundreds upon hundreds of star systems were visited and their planets were drilled down to their cores and stripped of valuable resources. After the ships moved on to the next system, the leftover excavation installations still lingered as a grim sign of past mining operations. In no time, two corporations monopolized the galaxy mining business, but with myriad systems to exploit they remained in a state of uneasy peace &mdash; a peace about to be broken due to an automated analysis of reports from a system mined many decades ago that yielded something weird, that led to a discovery of...Metallum.<br/><br/>This new substance, which seems to carry a promise for interstellar travel for living organisms, is bound to stir conflict. The Earth Government immediately steps in and claims ownership of the system in the name of the &quot;good of mankind&quot;, but it's clear that one of the two corporations will be afforded the exclusive rights to extract Metallum &ndash; and the huge profits that come with it. The tension raises instantly. Outright corporate war is avoided only thanks to a promise to grant the mining rights to the corporation that will develop more efficient mining infrastructure on the planets. Incidents are bound to happen with old installations used to destroy enemy Extractors since it's clear that the Earth Government will be handing their grants based on Metallum extraction rates of each corporation before finally awarding exclusive mining rights to one of them. The best pilots from each corporation sit down behind their consoles as their factory ships approach the system with production of Extractors set to maximum.<br/><br/>Metallum is a strategy game for two players who take on roles of corporate pilots charged with the task of directing their factory ships in order to construct a more efficient mining network on the system's planets than their opponent does. Each round consists of three main phases:<br/><br/><br/>     Programming: Players simultaneously create a program by composing puzzle-like subroutines that activate various systems on the factory ship (engines for moving, production for deploying Extractors, etc.). Some of the more powerful subroutines take more time to execute and hence impede your ability to react to the other player's moves &mdash; and they might even prevent you from activating other ship systems.<br/>     Action: Players execute programs composed during the programming phase. Since the order of execution of subroutines is decided by the player, the same program can yield vastly different outcomes, which leads to many interesting tactical decisions. During this phase new Extractors are also deployed on the system's planets.<br/>     Profits: Players earn credits for the planets on which they have their Extractors depending on who has more of them.<br/><br/><br/>After nine rounds, the pilot who's earned the most credits for his corporation is declared the winner. Will you be able to cover the planets of the system with a network of your Extractors and at the same time disturb the plans of your opponent? Although the conflict is officially only an economic one, the successful pilot needs to know when to strike at a rival's mining infrastructure or make &quot;slight modification&quot; to it. When all is said and done, nobody will remember the details of the struggle &mdash; only the name of the greatest pilot in the history of the galaxy.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "German first edition", "Polish first edition"], "name": "Metallum", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Area Control / Area Influence", "Card Drafting", "Modular Board", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["167001", "149496"], "usersrated": "291", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "average": "7.26027", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BW033 \u2013 Worker Placement", "The Spiel #189 - Pole Position"]}, "148272": {"poll": [], "name": "Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1784184.png", "videogameseries": ["Angry Video Game Nerd"], "videogametheme": ["Adult / Mature", "Comedy", "Cute Fantasy", "Horror", "Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["FreakZone Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "4", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["ScrewAttack Entertainment LLC"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1784184_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures is a challenging retro-style platform game based on the Angry Video Game Nerd web series created by James Rolfe.

It has now become a major source of income for the Texan farmers, while at the same time attracting cattle thieves of all kinds.<br/><br/>In Longhorn, the players assume the roles of two particularly feared outlaws: Eagle Perkins and Jessie Artist Byrd. The aim of the game is simple: to steal cattle (and a few gold nuggets, if possible) to see who can amass the most money by the end of the game &mdash; or who can get his opponent arrested by the sheriff!<br/><br/>The game is set up by shuffling the 9 locations and setting them up in a 3x3 grid, selecting 9 tokens randomly and assigning one to each location (if the sheriff token is in play, it must be placed on Nugget Hill), and finally randomly distributing the coloured longhorn cattle meeples to each location, with the number required being shown on each location. The start player then chooses a location with 4 cattle and places the player piece in it.<br/><br/>The game ends in one of three ways:<br/>- If a player takes the sheriff token, they lose immediately<br/>- If a player takes all 9 cattle of any one colour, they win immediately (if they did both in the same turn, they lose)<br/>- If no legal move can be made, the players score; gold nugget tokens are worth their face value and each colour of longhorn is worth $100 for each cow of the same colour still on the board. For example, if the Perkins player has 4 black cattle and 5 are left on the board, each of his 4 black longhorns are worth $500.

Operating at the highest levels of command, you will not bother yourself with micromanaging regiments or interfering in the affairs of your colonels.

Basing is flexible, so long as both armies are based in the same manner.<br/><br/>Altar of Freedom is a turn-based game, although the duration of each turn is determined by a variable Turn Clock. At the start of each turn, players secretly bid Priority Points for the opportunity to maneuver their divisions before the enemy. After the secret bidding, players reveal their highest bids and begin maneuvering divisions in order of priority. After each new bid is reached, players roll to remove time from the Turn Clock. The Turn Clock is the strategic center-piece of the game, since players vie for control of the clock throughout the battle. He who controls the clock can manipulate the speed of the countdown. When the clock does expire, the turn ends immediately and players complete some minor adjustments before proceeding to the next turn.

The power meter must be carefully managed if you hope to crush your opponent as your power meter determines your movement and your ability to execute the Malachim.

Twelve of your favorite fungi are here, updated for the mythic rules, and when we say updated we mean complete stat blocks, yes, but more than that every fungal creature has its own unique and exciting new mythic abilities, from an mythic ascomoid's puffball avalanche to a mythic fungus queen's battle pods and a mythic mu spore's unstoppable titan. From the vicious vegepygmy to the virulent violet fungus, the seductive fungus queen to the colossal corruption of the mu spore, this product covers CRs from 1 to 26. In addition to a dozen familiar fungal monsters, Mythic Monsters: Molds, Slimes, and Fungi also includes rules for the fungal creature subtype as well as eight mythic fungal hazards, from the familiar green slime and yellow mold to shriekers and azure fungus! To top it all off, Mythic Monsters: Molds, Slimes, and Fungi introduces an entirely new 13th mythic fungal creature, the sublime and mysterious fairy ring, a living portal into the realms of the fey that can be a boon or bane to weary and lost travelers.<br/><br/>The Mythic Monsters series from Legendary Games brings you dynamic and exciting mechanics alongside evocative and cinematic new abilities that really help creatures live up to their flavor text, whether they are creatures of real-world myth and legend or creatures born out of the RPG tradition itself. These creatures can work just as well in a non-mythic campaign as they do in one that incorporates the full mythic rules, as you can throw them at your jaded players who think they&rsquo;ve seen it all or know the standard monster stats as well as you do.

These strange bodiless fiends date back to the first edition Monster Manual II, and are one of the stranger creatures of the lower planes, feared far and wide for their deadly kiss, which provides a very unforgiving &ldquo;save or die&rdquo; experience at a very low level, a terrible fate that is only compounded by the fact that the transformation is detailed in particularly macabre fashion as the character&rsquo;s hair falls out and their facial features slowly twist over the course of one or more days. The first vargouille in this book, the singing vargouille (CR 3) can also cause such a transformation, though in this case, it is done by a haunting lullaby, instead. Singing vargouilles can also unleash powerful and damaging sonic shrieks, and their bite inflicts a curse of silence. These terrors pale before the bloodsucking vargouille (CR 5) however, which does not kiss its victims but instead attaches to them and drains their blood, transforming their victims into wights, whose heads separate from their bodies and become vargouilles when they are destroyed. Finally, the giant vargouille (CR 7) is a vargouille of titanic proportions, with a propensity for swooping down and swallowing human prey whole in a single gulp, and either allowing them to be digested by powerful acid that inflicts difficult-to-heal wounds, or simply spitting them back out again in the air, leaving the victim to fall to his doom.<br/><br/>"}, "148389": {"rpgartist": ["Peter Bradley"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Temple of the Red God", "rpgdesigner": ["Jason Vey"], "rpgproducer": ["Tim Burns"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1786177.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissuearticle": ["Pre-Order Sections"], "rpg": ["Amazing Adventures"], "rpgpublisher": ["Troll Lord Games"], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Pulp)", "Occult"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1786177_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>&quot;Pulp: Hard-boiled detectives, fedora-wearing action heroes, and Steampunk gadgeteers rocketing to battle with their jet packs against bloodthirsty Thule cultists of the Third Reich.&quot;<br/><br/>Tens of thousands of years before our time, in the mythic Thurian Age, the cult of the Red God, the Blood Imperator, spread across the world like a plague, its legions more powerful than the Aztecs and more cultured than the Mayans.

The consequences of each battle will depend on the players actions, meaning that each individual enemy killed can affect the outcome of a result. The battlefront will not be one giant, seamless map, but a compilation of inter-connected, smaller size areas, each one capable of affecting the other.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "148413": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Brian Henk", "Clayton Skancke"], "average": "3", "poll": [], "name": "Body Builders: A Tale of Taxidermy", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Set Collection", "Take That"], "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1930532_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Clayton Skancke"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Nevermade Games", "Overworld Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1930532.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Card Game", "Dice"], "age": "13", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "In the light strategy game Body Builders, 3-6 players assume the role of lonely taxidermists who recruit vultures, hyenas, crocodiles and other critters to scavenge for animal parts that can be combined to build themselves a friend.

Covering both the European and Pacific Theaters of Operations during World War II, World in Flames is global in scope while simulating each branch of service in detail. Land units are corps and army level, supplemented with specialized divisions. Naval units include individual counters for every carrier, battleship, cruiser, and light cruiser in the war. Air units represent groups of 250 to 500 airplanes displayed on screen using 1000+ unique bitmapped images. With 6000+ unique units, 250+ countries, and a global map of 70,200 hexes, World in Flames is the premier World War II grand strategy game.<br/><br/>All 11 scenarios from World in Flames Final Edition are included and they range from the small 5 turn Barbarossa offensive in Russia and the 5 turn Guadalcanal battle in the Pacific, through to the 36 turn Global War campaign which spans all of Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, the Atlantic, and the Pacific. You can play either the Axis or the Allied side or take the role of one of the 8 major powers. Besides solitaire against yourself and head-to-head, you can play over the Internet. The last two modes of play permit team play with up to 6 players (3 per side).<br/><br/>In addition to the full set of rules from World in Flames, Final Edition, there are 80 optional rules. Under the optional rules section you can choose to include the World in Flames expansion modules: Ships in Flames, Planes in Flames, Carrier Planes in Flames, Cruisers in Flames, Convoys in Flames, and others.<br/><br/>This simulation models national production from conveying raw resources over rail and sea lines to factories for the manufacturing infantry, armor, naval, and air combat units. Because oil was so important during World War II, there are separate optional rules for synthetic oil plants and deployment of oil reserves to the front lines. Game units are represented in both armies and corps, aircraft carriers, naval task forces, and the air groups that took part. Everything you need to re-fight the greatest conflict in history.<br/><br/>Two to six players make the strategic decisions that decide the fate of nations. What forces to produce, where to commit them, when and how? No two games of World in Flames play the same, no strategy is foolproof, any decision may have unforeseen, long-term consequences.<br/><br/>If you want to change the world then World in Flames is for you.<br/><br/>IMPORTANT NOTE: This title does not include an AI player in the initial release.

Here comes the annual retreat for monsters from all hierarchies to sharpen their skills after playing bad guys in a variety of board games for the past year. The most anticipated event, of course, is the legendary lunchtime battle! No one wants to be sent off on an errand to buy lunch for all the others, so brace yourself and fight for your monster's dignity!<br/><br/>In Monster College: Lunchtime Battle, each player chooses one monster from his hand to join the &quot;counting circle&quot; each turn. Based on the die roll and a counting process, 1-3 unfortunate monsters are fingered to buy lunch for others (earning minus points along the way for the corresponding players) &mdash; but these candidate monsters are so childish that in later turns they'll use their special abilities to bend the counting rules in their favor. In the end, the player whose collected candidate monsters show the most overall &quot;hunger&quot; loses the game and must go buy lunch (or whatever else they agreed to before the game) for everyone else!<br/><br/>\u4e00\u5e74\u4e00\u5ea6\u7684\u9032\u4fee\u65e5\u53c8\u5230\u4e86\uff0c\u5e73\u6642\u5728\u5404\u5927\u904a\u6232\u626e\u6f14\u7a31\u8077\u58de\u86cb\u7684\u9b54\u7269\u5011\u518d\u5ea6\u56de\u5230\u6821\u5712\uff0c\u8a8d\u771f\u8907\u7fd2\u5404\u7a2e\u9b54\u7269\u5fc5\u4fee\u6280\u80fd\u3002\u597d\u4e0d\u5bb9\u6613\u6490\u904e\u65e9\u4e0a\u7684\u8ab2\u7a0b\uff0c\u9b54\u7269\u5011\u6700\u671f\u5f85\u7684\u5348\u9910\u6642\u9593\u7d42\u65bc\u5230\u4e86\uff01\u4eca\u5e74\u7a76\u7adf\u662f\u54ea\u500b\u73ed\u7d1a\u7684\u9b54\u7269\u8981\u7576\u8dd1\u817f\u5c0f\u5f1f\u53bb\u5e6b\u5927\u5bb6\u8cb7\u4fbf\u7576\u5462\uff1f\u9019\u5834\u5e74\u5ea6\u4fbf\u7576\u5927\u6230\u5373\u5c07\u63ed\u958b\u5e8f\u5e55\uff01<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual first edition"], "age": "8", "name": "Monster College: Lunchtime Battle", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Press Your Luck", "Set Collection", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Variable Player Powers"], "average": "6", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": ["Monsters"]}, "148492": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1803351.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Michele Esmanech"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Michele Esmanech"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1803351_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Murder/Mystery", "Print & Play", "Science Fiction"], "description": "In Dystopian: the manhunt, one to four players assume the role of special agents of the Dystopia Police Department (called Sector 9), with the goal of investigating a murder case, finding the criminal, among four suspects and, eventually, catching him, it or her, before he gets away.<br/>The agents will move around the megalopolis of Dystopia, investigating the numerous locations (distributed among districts and suburbs) meeting people, talking to them, gaining and finding hints and leads that make the investigation progress, bringing them closer and closer to the murderer.<br/>Dystopia is a City controlled by two rival Corporations (Varcom and Infracorp), that are in the business of AI-Roids: artificially intelligent robots that live with the humans.<br/>Dystopia features a plethora of many different locations, where the players will have to conduct their investigation.<br/><br/>Dystopian: the manhunt features the following mechanics: worker placement, variable player powers, action selection, network building, cooperative/solitaire play, press your luck.<br/><br/>The players will have to roll dice, and allocate them on their agent's sheet to gain these resources: <br/>1) warrants: to enter a location<br/>2) attack: to respond to an attack from an encounter<br/>3) evade: to hide from an attack from an encounter<br/>4) interact: to interact with encounters or locations<br/>5) analyze: to analyze hints and gain evidence about who committed the crime<br/><br/>Such resources will be used to deal with encounters the players will meet around the city, to advance their agent's abilities, ultimately, to catch the suspect who is found guilty.<br/><br/>The game is divided in 2 stages: the first is the Search, where players have to discovered who, among the 4 suspects, committed the crime; and the second, the Chase, where the suspect tries to hide in Dystopia, and it's up to the agents to seize him (it or her).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "age": "12", "name": "Dystopian: the manhunt", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Press Your Luck", "Route/Network Building", "Worker Placement"], "average": "6.375", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": ["Cyberpunk", "Solitaire Games", "Solitaire Print and Play Contest"]}, "148493": {"statistics": [], "name": "Jaguar Controller", "usersrated": "0", "videogamehardwarecategory": ["Controller"], "videogamehwversion": ["Jaguar Controller"], "average": "0", "videogamehardware": ["Atari Jaguar"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3054770.jpg", "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3054770_t.jpg", "videogamehwmfg": ["Atari, Inc."], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>The standard Jaguar controller has a d-pad, three action buttons (A, B, C), Pause and Option buttons.

Each character has a full stat block, including campaign traits, a detailed background and personality, and advice on advancement through 4th level. Find one that suits you and you&rsquo;re ready to play. These characters have been built using a 20-point buy, as many Pathfinder players and GMs prefer it. However, each comes with instructions on how to adjust the stats to a 15-point buy, should your GM wish to use the standard for Paizo&rsquo;s adventure paths. If your group enjoys an epic fantasy feel for their characters, then adjustments up to a 25-point buy are also available. Whatever your style of play, just a few minor tweaks will have you ready to go.<br/><br/>The iconic consist of four human characters and four unique races from the NeoExodus: A House Divided campaign setting such as:<br/><br/>     Cavian: Creatures of myth, whispered in legend, lost in the mists of history &ndash; and now returned for reasons unknown to any but themselves. Such are the cavians, a race of humanoid rodents noted for their incredible psionic abilities.<br/>     Cynean: Crystalline scholars of all things arcane, the cyneans are as mighty in mind as in body. While the psionically inclined might expect the cyneans to share their tendencies, these beings of living crystal are masters of magic, not mentalism. On Exodus, which is both their home and their only known haunt, they can ever be found seeking some mystical secret or long-lost spell.<br/>     Dalrean: Dalrean are a race of sentient, mobile plants. If a treant is a thinking tree, a dalrean is a thinking flower, and indeed, the spellcasters of this race are noted for their astonishing floral &lsquo;spellbuds.&rsquo; Dalrean, who live exceedingly long lives, are closely tied to the natural cycles of Exodus.<br/>     Prymidian: Prymidians are regal, red-skinned humanoids. Their stately demeanor and formidable build impress other races and their learning follows suit. The prymidians are a communication and language-inclined race, dedicated to scientific reason, research, expansion of knowledge and discovery. Their culture seeks to know all there is to know in Exodus, and to communicate that knowledge to others.
