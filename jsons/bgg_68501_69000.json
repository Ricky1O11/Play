Most games are playable in a hour. Even with six players, the rounds are quick. The movement mechanics are designed to feel more like driving and less like geometry.<br/><br/>Players select their vehicles from eight templates that represent a wide variety of vehicles from dune buggies and muscle cars all the way to heavy duty trucks and SUVs - each with its own unique characteristics. Players then use dice to further customize (and arm) the vehicles. The dice represent weapons, equipment and even the driver of the vehicle.<br/><br/>Play is centered around a maneuver deck that allows the players to 'program' their action for a turn. Programmable actions include both movement AND attacks. But players need to be careful, their drivers may not be able to handle EVERYTHING demanded of them resulting in a possible loss of control.<br/><br/>Games are scenario based with clear goals to keep the games shorter and focused. Scenarios include such situations as busting through a police roadblock, attacking a renegade compound, escort missions and more. Teams are used, allowing the players to be creative in their vehicle (and equipment) selections. Some vehicles may be better for certain tasks but it always handy to have someone riding backup.<br/><br/>Players can check here on BGG, as well as dicefestgames.com for info on development, new vehicles, new equipment and new scenarios<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"22353": "DiceFestGames edition"}, "average": "7.13268", "name": "Outrider", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2689": "Action / Movement Programming"}, "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "41", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5496": "Thematic Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"10234": "Outrider"}}, "68505": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Imperishable Night", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"22354": "Japanese DOS CD-ROM edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic688091.jpg", "videogameseries": {"4770": "Project Shrine Maiden"}, "videogametheme": {"2329": "Folklore"}, "videogamegenre": {"2505": "Shoot 'em Up"}, "videogamecharacter": {"27084": "Alice Margatroid"}, "average": "8.36364", "videogamefranchise": {"4833": "Project Shrine Maiden"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "usersrated": "11", "poll": {}, "vgcharacterversion": {"270350": "Alice Margatroid (Imperishable Night)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic688091_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/>The 8th installment in the project Shrine Maiden series.<br/><br/>Imperishable Night is a straightforward shoot'em-up, except that the player controls a flying girl instead of the typical spacecraft.

The player controls a space ship as it navigates the terrain, flying either to the left or right.

The object is to destroy alien invaders, while protecting astronauts on the landscape from abduction. Humans that are successfully abducted return as mutants that attack the ship. Defeating the aliens allows the player to progress to the next level. Failing to protect the astronauts, however, causes the planet to explode and the level to become populated with mutants. Surviving the waves of mutants results in the restoration of the planet. Players are allotted three chances (lives) to progress through the game and are able to earn more by reaching certain scoring benchmarks. A life is lost if the ship comes into contact with an enemy or its projectiles.

As in many wars, you have some idea of an opponent's strength and general location, but very little about the exact composition and location of his forces. Hence, the value of intelligence gathering should not be underrated.<br/><br/>Strategy will vary from game to game, but a major focus should be on the capture of stars: without them your forces will not grow, and , in the long run their lack will certainly cause you to lose. Think carefully about the initial layout of stars, and place your ships to capture the maximum number of points as soon as possible. Try and maintain a balanced force of ship sizes. Movement is hidden, and fairly rapid shifts of forces from one quadrant to another are possible. Remember that in combat the aim is to have the largest combined force - not necessarily a single, high value ship. A single, large strike ship may penetrate enemy lines and take out the opponent's home base... but if he sees it coming he may have time to regroup and knock it out.

Categorized by Sony as a miniature personal digital assistant, the device features a monochrome liquid crystal display (LCD), infrared  communication capability, a real-time clock, built-in flash memory, and a sound capability. Connecting to a PlayStation through a memory card slot, the PocketStation also functions as a PlayStation memory card. It was released exclusively in Japan on January 23, 1999.<br/><br/>Software for the PocketStation was typically distributed as extras for PlayStation games, included in the CD-ROM, enhancing the games with added features. Stand-alone software could also be downloaded through the PlayStation console. The software is then transferred to the PocketStation for use. A built-in infrared data interface allows direct transfer of data such as game saves between PocketStation units, as well as multiplayer gaming.<br/><br/>The original Japanese ship date for the PocketStation was set for December 23, 1998, but it was delayed a full month. Sony only shipped an initial 60,000 units of the peripheral when it was released on January 23, 1999. It was initially available in two case colors: white and clear. It proved extremely popular, selling out all over the region. Sony planned to release the PocketStation in the United States, but cancelled the localization due to manufacturing and supply-and-demand problems. A few games, such as Final Fantasy VIII and SaGa Frontier 2, retained PocketStation functionality in their localized versions.<br/><br/>The PocketStation's most popular game was Dokodemo Issho, which sold over 1.5 million copies in Japan and is the first game to star Sony's mascot Toro.

Instead, it bounces around with a downward gravity, and the player controls a small shrine maiden on the floor, who can move sideways and shoot talismans upwards, hitting the ball and giving it momentum. If the ball hits the player, he loses a life.<br/><br/>The ball's upwards (bouncing) momentum decreases a bit with each bounce, but the ball's sideways momentum doesn't decrease naturally.

Critters series of Open Gaming Content Sourcebooks: Along the Banks of the River Vaal. The E.N. Critters series as a whole is a set of theme-based creature books with the theme/setting information secondary to the creatures and used mainly as a focus to design them around as well as to provide GMs with additional background, species interaction and general environmental descriptions. The creatures are fairly well detailed, while the environmentally based themes have been left intentionally vague in many places to allow the GM more leeway to modify and drop them into their own campaign if so desired. It is our hope that these creatures and themes will spark creative and enjoyable game sessions.<br/><br/>This volume's theme is of creatures dwelling along a wide river known as the River Vaal although the water&rsquo;s edge in any body of fresh water, be it lake, pond, marsh, etc. will work just as well. The primary range is from temperate to warm, although some allowances have been made for creatures that could be found in colder climes.<br/><br/>     More than two dozen all new creatures<br/>     Full colour illustrations throughout<br/>     Detailed ecologies and background<br/>     A &quot;Suggested Knowledge&quot; table for each creature<br/>     A &quot;Rules &amp; Game Balance&quot;section for each entry<br/>     Counters for all creatures<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The River Vaal flows through the heart of the land, starting at the Firewind Mountain range and the Feygarden Hills, flowing through the edge of the Dunshadow Moors, and then winding its way lazily through the Forest of Broken Limbs. Once it emerges from the forest, it then passes over the Knife Edge, plummeting far and fast in a grand waterfall known as Dowdin&rsquo;s Falls. The area before the Knife Edge and Dowdin&rsquo;s Falls is known as the Upper Vaal, and after it, appropriately, is the Lower Vaal. After the falls, it forms a vast body of water known as Dowdin&rsquo;s Lake, feeding the nearby Grey Marshes and eventually becoming a river again and passing the Alabaster Hills and Growling Woods. It then meanders for a time and enters the Andelenian Forest where a large portion of it passes underground and feeds the massive roots of EarthTree. Rising to the surface again in the southern part of the forest, it continues flowing past the Swamp of the Sun and through the Feathered Sea Plains. It again picks up speed through the Azurothian Peaks and yet again slows down after it enters the Pale Jungle, eventually emptying out into the Helvenin Sea at the Aris Delta. The river is shown on the map as a single strip of blue for the sake of simplicity. Innumerable other rivers and streams feed into it, and there are plenty of backwater areas along its length.<br/><br/>"}, "68682": {"videogame": {"118158": "Heavy Rain: Move Edition"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Heavy Rain", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"22903": "Japanese PlayStation 3 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic728480.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2280": "Crime"}, "videogamefranchise": {"6404": "Greatest Hits (Best Selling PlayStation Games, US)"}, "usersrated": "300", "videogameexpansion": {"90963": "Heavy Rain Chronicles: Episode One: The Taxidermist"}, "average": "7.9085", "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4435": "PlayStation 3"}, "videogamehonor": {"31876": "2009 Game Critics Most Original Game of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"194843": "Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls Collection"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic728480_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Heavy Rain is an interactive drama video game developed by Quantic Dream exclusively for the PlayStation 3.

There also is a cardboard &quot;plate&quot; (a round disk for discarded tiles).<br/><br/>The goal is to form crosswords on the grid boards.

Tiles are drawn and discarded (openly, so other players can grab the discarded ones). When the first player finishes, the other get penalties depending on the number of tiles left over and the number of tiles missing for the basic word.<br/><br/>F&uuml;nfer-Spiel: Each player has to form a cross of two words with five tiles. When that isn't possible, additional tiles are drawn, but not more than two unused ones can be held in the end. The first player to achieve a legal crossword scores points.<br/><br/>Achter-Spiel: Same as the F&uuml;nfer-Spiel, but two or more crosses have to be formed, three tiles can be kept.<br/><br/>Kaufspiel (for two players): Each player draws ten tiles and looks at them without sorting them. The active player can then announce &quot;buying&quot; or &quot;playing&quot;. When buying, he/she also announces a number of tiles. Both players now have to discard this number of tiles and redraw them. When playing, both try to form a legal cross with their tiles. The winning player gets 10-15 points, the other one a penalty depending on the number of unused tiles.<br/><br/>Leiter: Two columns of ten letters each are places on the table. The task of the players is to extend each pair of letters in one row into words. Thus they can get rid of their tiles. A player who cannot play has to draw a new tile. The first player to get rid of his/her tiles is the winner.<br/><br/>Gruppenspiel: Similar to Leiter, but with an open cross instead of fixed columns. So the players can add tiles in any direction, as long as the letter combination occurs in a German word.<br/><br/>Wettrennen: Each player gets 19 tiles and secretly forms a cross using at least 11 tiles. The score of the first player to achieve this is 10 plus the last digit squared (11 to 91 points). The other players lose one point for each unused tile.<br/><br/>W&ouml;rter anbinden: A letter is placed on the table. Each player takes turns to add a letter, but the letters still have to form the beginning of a word. When that is not possible, all but the last (at least) two tiles are discarded and the last letters start the new word. The first player who can use up his/her tiles is the winner.<br/><br/>Ausf&uuml;llspiel: Three letters are flipped open on the plate in the middle of the table. All players now try to form a word which uses two of these letters as first and last letters. The first player to manage this is the winner.<br/><br/>Alleinspiel: A collection of four solitaire games.<br/><br/>The designer of Kreuzwort-Pulok is uncredited, but the preface is signed &quot;J.M.&quot; (It seems likely, but isn't entirely clear whether these are the initials of the designer).<br/><br/>(User Summary by HilkMAN)<br/><br/>"}, "68754": {"statistics": {}, "name": "WET", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"93439": "English/European Xbox 360 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic958755.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2280": "Crime"}, "usersrated": "27", "average": "6.64815", "videogamegenre": {"2161": "Action Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4435": "PlayStation 3"}, "videogamehonor": {"33168": "2010 CVA Best Audio of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic958755_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;WET is an acrobatic shooter game, developed by Artificial Mind and Movement and published by Bethesda Softworks for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game stars a heroine named Rubi Malone voiced by actress Eliza Dushku.<br/><br/>WET is an action game that combines shooting and swordplay with stylish acrobatics and a mass of gore. The main character, Rubi, carries twin pistols (which appear to be revolvers, but hold a surprising amount of ammunition) and a sword (she can also carry dual shotguns, sub-machine guns, or crossbows), and can fire while jumping, sliding on her knees, seducing goons and running on walls. During these acrobatic actions, the game enters slow motion, and she will automatically aim at a second enemy, allowing the player to shoot at two enemies at once. She can also combine her attacks, such as wall running off a person or performing a sword uppercut while sliding. Racking up kills and collecting multiplier icons gains multipliers, which increase score and the rate at which Rubi regenerates health. Rubi can also regain health by finding bottles of whiskey. When activated, she takes a swig from the bottle, then throws the bottle into the air and shoots it. In some sections of the game, Rubi's face will get covered in blood and she will go into a murderous, berzerker-like rage. These sections are presented in noir style, with bold red, black and white visuals. Rubi's attacks become faster and stronger to fight against large numbers of enemies during these sections, and killing chains of enemies extends her psychotic fury. There are also motorway sections that feature shooting integrated with quick time events.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;WET_(video_game),&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "68756": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Lone Wolf Club Newsletter (Special Issue - New Year 1986)", "rpgproducer": {"36594": "Simon Osborne"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic690293.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"4189": "Lone Wolf Club Newsletter"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"53560": "1986 New Year's Special"}, "rpg": {"4189": "Lone Wolf Club Newsletter"}, "rpgissueversion": {"23002": "Internet Edition"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic690293_t.jpg", "description": "User summary of articles in this newsletter:<br/><br/>     Monastery Mailbag: a selection of letters from Lone Wolf fans.<br/>     The Kai Konnection: a pen-friend listing feature.<br/>     The Summer Special Crossword Competition: solution to and winners of the previous special newsletter's competition.<br/>     News from the Monastery: previewing The Magnamund Companion.<br/>     Warlock Quest: an advertisement for Warlock.<br/>     Magnamund: a condensed history of the last free planet of Aon, covering the major events that have shaped this world in the 18,000 years from its creation to the defeat of Darklord Zagarna.<br/>     Order Form: for purchasing Lone Wolf Gamebooks.<br/>     New Year's Special Treasure Hunt Competition: requiring entrants to use their copies of the gamebooks to solve a riddle.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "68757": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Lone Wolf Club Newsletter (Issue 5 - 1986)", "rpgproducer": {"36594": "Simon Osborne"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic690316.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"4189": "Lone Wolf Club Newsletter"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"53576": "Beyond the Nightmare Gate & Castle Death"}, "rpg": {"4189": "Lone Wolf Club Newsletter"}, "rpgissueversion": {"23005": "Internet Edition"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic690316_t.jpg", "description": "User summary of articles in this newsletter:<br/><br/>     Monastery Mailbag: a selection of letters from Lone Wolf fans.<br/>     Order Form: for purchasing Lone Wolf Gamebooks.<br/>     The Kai Konnection: a pen-friend listing feature.<br/>     News from the Monastery: previewing Grey Star Book 3: Beyond the Nightmare Gate and the cover of Book 07: Castle Death.<br/>     Lone Wolf Crossword<br/>     Caption Competition: winners of the previous newsletter's competition.<br/>     Grey Star Book 3: Beyond the Nightmare Gate &amp; Book 07: Castle Death: an offer to purchase the new books signed by the author.<br/>     Lone Wolf Club Painting &amp; Drawing Competition: in which entrants were to illustrate a scene from the Lone Wolf or Grey Star books.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "68758": {"boardgamedesigner": {"36335": {"name": "Luke Venechuk"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Grass of Parnassus", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic694863_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic694863.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"23008": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "A strategy/fantasy game played on two decks of standard poker-style playing cards, the basic idea behind The Grass of Parnassus was to create a fun strategy game which could be played on standard cards.<br/><br/>Each player has a city.

Covering traders, explorers, and warriors in exquisite detail, players and Game Masters alike may discover the true secret behind the elves' supremacy on the waves.<br/><br/>Crews: Elves do not hire out their services to just any captain and even then can prove extremely expensive.  However, for the captain who will settle for nothing less than the very best, gold cannot hire a better crew than one comprised solely of elves.<br/><br/>Weaponry: New shipboard weapons employed by the elves, including the Heavy Ballista, Fire Tower, Bound Bolts, and Naptha Elven Fire.<br/><br/>Ships of the Elves: Nearly 20 new vessels are featured, covering the entire vista of elven ingenuity in ship design.  From the glorious and rarely seen Sea Haven to the deadly fast Elemental Ram, few pirates are foolish enough to challenge an elven fleet at sea, be it from the explorer, trader or warrior clans.<br/><br/>"}, "68786": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Max-It", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "1991", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic699743_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"11934": {"name": "Numero Games Company"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic699743.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"23047": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From rules page:<br/><br/>Max-It is a unique dice game played with a special set of five dice.

Colour is a key element in the gameplay, and players will experience an \u014ckami-esque style when entering certain parts of the city. In order to make that district coloured (&quot;inspired&quot;) again, players must weaken the German forces occupying the area. In doing so, that district's citizens regain their hope, characterized by the &quot;Will to Fight&quot; (WtF) factor, a measure of public morale.<br/><br/>In areas with low WtF, the area is dark, with colour being various shades of grey (with the exception of several German flags, bright red and complete with swastikas), whereas in areas with high WtF, the area is vibrant and with full colour. WtF also affects gameplay, as in areas with low WtF, the area is filled with German soldiers who patrol in most places of the map in large numbers.<br/>It is up to the player to return colour to areas of darkness.<br/><br/>In areas with high WtF, the Germans will not be completely evicted, but they will no longer be everywhere at once, and will primarily be centered around military bases, barracks, police stations, HQs, and other strategically important areas. In addition, the French people will play an active role in the struggle for areas with high WtF. For example, if Sean, the main character, gets in a fight with German patrols, allies like the French Resistance, Maquis, and even French passersby will intervene against the occupiers.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players will upgrade their character in the form of &quot;Perks&quot;. These will improve accuracy, ammo counts, damage and more. Perks are gained through actions, such as evading high alarm levels, sniping targets or demolishing a set number of German installations.<br/><br/>After you are introduced to the black marketeer Santos, you unlock weapons smugglers to buy weapons, ammunition, explosives, maps and other items.

It is a game of brutal attrition and slashing advances. Opening on the evening of D-Day, with the Allies on the beaches and the Germans reacting (albeit belatedly) to the landings, the game covers the full campaign through to the battle of the Ruhr Pocket in April of 1945.<br/><br/>With plenty of armor, paratroop divisions, naval gunfire, air superiority and even the 79th Funnies, the Allies will break out from the beaches and race across France toward the Seine River. To keep pace with operations they will face difficult logistical decisions including the grounding of units and Red Ball Express in favor of other operations, a surprisingly thin infantry leash, and whether to give Monty the lead in offensive operations over Patton (or vice-versa)&hellip; For the Allies there&rsquo;s a chance at an early auto-victory for breaking out of the landing areas ahead of schedule, but they can quickly lose the game if they don&rsquo;t cross the Seine on schedule.<br/><br/>The German player will need to counter the Allied push with a healthy dose of reinforcements (admittedly of low quality), but with very limited replacements. They will need to take advantage of opportunities to thwart the Allies such as when Monty looks the other way at Antwerp, and they can even win the game, although not the war, by launching a successful Counteroffensive (aka. The Bulge). Careful use of Panzer Brigades and Tiger Battalions in offense and defense will play a key role in stopping the Allies.<br/><br/>Storming the Reich is a two-map game with units portrayed mostly at division level (with some armored brigades and battalions). Each hex is about 8 miles across (or about 13km). Each turn represents a month of operations accept during summer where each turn is 2 weeks. For players of Red Storm over the Reich, there are many similarities such as the variable movement allowances for both sides (a key feature for fog of war, variability, replay value, and solitaire play) and the same basic combat engine. A key difference is the elimination of the Redeployment Phase.<br/><br/>There are 3 scenarios included. Scenario one is the full 15-turn campaign using both maps, beginning on D-Day and ending in April of 1945. The second is a one-map &ldquo;Normandy Breakout&rdquo; scenario &ndash; at only 4 turns it is a perfect learning scenario covering the initial desperate fighting following the landings. Lastly is a one-map &ldquo;Bulge to Victory&rdquo; scenario where both players really get to flex their gaming muscles.<br/><br/><br/>Ted Raicer's game on the campaign for Northwest Europe, using a variation of his Red Storm Over the Reich system. <br/>It does not link up with Red Storm Over the Reich.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"23117": "First Edition"}, "name": "Storming the Reich", "playingtime": "400", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "7.29795", "usersrated": "55", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "age": "0"}, "68817": {"rpgitemversion": {"23118": "Hardcover Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Unbidden", "rpgproducer": {"13991": "Matthew McFarland"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic807954.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "average": "9.55", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"158": "Horror"}, "rpg": {"3205": "Mage: The Awakening"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"1682": "Night Horrors (nWoD)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic807954_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>I used to be so foolish.

It is the magical that makes a normal story into a fantasy that delights listeners, readers, and gamers by making all the impossibilities we can imagine become real. Dreams of magic can make even the most mundane day something to cherish, like a poem evoking the charm of the everyday world.<br/><br/>But sometimes, just like poems, magic can become stale and clich&eacute;d. Through repeated exposure, its novelty can wear off, and certainly, thirty years of magic missiles and fingers of death have been enough to render many fantasy gamers jaded. At its core, saying, &ldquo;My love is a dove,&rdquo; in a poem is as trite as, &ldquo;I cast detect magic.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Elements of Magic opens the world of magic to you, letting you create almost any type of magic-user you&rsquo;d like. Magic is an artform, like poetry, and any good poet is never content to merely recite the works of others.<br/><br/>Elements of Magic is modular, able to fit whatever role you want it to play. It can be added to an existing campaign that already has wizards, sorcerers, clerics, and druids, perhaps representing another, higher sort of magic, or it can wholly replace the existing magic system, providing a whole new feel to your fantasy gaming. You will need a d20 core rulebook to use these rules, but this book will let you ignore the old, clich&eacute;d spells presented in those books, and create your own works of magical art.<br/><br/>Elements of Magic eliminates the spell memorization and preparation system entirely, replacing it with something bold, new and flexible. This book uses a spell list and magic point system, allowing you to build spells modularly, and letting you decide what the mechanics actually mean.<br/><br/>Elements of Magic is a rules module designed to replace the &quot;fire and forget&quot; spell system of the d20 Core Rules. The d20 spell system, while balanced and usable, is not flexible enough to model the magic users from most fantasy books and movies. Few wizards have ever memorized or prepared a spell, and even fewer forget them immediately afterwards. In Elements of Magic, each character has only a single spellcasting level, no matter how many types of magic she learns in her career. The Elements of Magic gives characters many times the options of the standard d20 rules. Individual spells are replaced by spell lists. Instead of learning a fireball spell, for example, a mage could learn the Evoke Fire spell list, which is very flexible as to its usage and appearance. Nor is the mage limited to fire evocations &ndash; with 20 elements to choose from, she could learn Evoke Lightning to stun and damage your foes, Transform Light to make them evaporate into a dim glow, or even exotic combinations of spell lists, such as Create Force/Drain Time, to lock them in a bubble of stasis. It would take thousands of standard spells to duplicate the effects of the spell lists in this 94-page book.<br/><br/>"}, "68839": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1002393.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1924", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgameartist": {"45720": "Margaret Mary Tempest"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"507": {"name": "Chad Valley Co Ltd."}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1002393_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1094": {"name": "Educational"}}, "description": "This game has 100 playing spaces.

If he obtains it he may continue asking until he asks for a card which the player asked does not hold. The right of asking in then transferred to him and he in the same way continues to ask till in like manner disqualified. When any player has obtained all the cards of a set forming the complete proverb, he turns them up on the table. The player who first completes all the Proverbs of which he holds cards at the commencement of the game, of which any cards remain to him as the game progresses, wins.<br/><br/>"}, "68907": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Royal Game of Mother Goose", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1860", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2282818_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"11937": {"name": "Richard Marsh"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2282818.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"23218": "Richard Marsh edition 1860"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Each card is printed with a title and illustration of a character, and a rhyming couplet.

If he answers incorrectly, the properties go to his adversary. The answers to all of the questions on the Examination Cards are in the Official Rule and Answer Booklet that comes with the game.<br/><br/>The game ends when all property is claimed by the players.<br/><br/>The game states that it was Authenticated by Historic Charleston Foundation, Inc.<br/>Cover picture &quot;Adapted from a Lithograph by Smith, Painting by Hill 1850. From the Collection of the South Carolina Historical Society.<br/><br/>Description from Rules:<br/>The Charleston Game is a family-type game which reflects Charleston's beauty, history, and culture.

On his turn, a player chooses a question from one of the question categories. After the question has been read out loud, all players choose their answer by playing cards face down on the table. All answers are revealed simultaneously. Each question has an answer between 1-100 and player's answer is the sum of the numbers he played. The player whose answer is closest to the correct answer, wins the question card for himself/herself but loses the number cards he/she played. Players may also play 'pass'-card and skip the question, but get to draw new number cards instead.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players calculate their scores: players get points from won question cards and from hidden score cards that are dealt in the beginning of the game. During the game, players may influence what is the value of each question category at the end of the game - category's value depends on how many questions has been asked from that category. The game comes with eight question categories, from which five are chosen for each game. The player with the most points at the end of the game, is the winner!<br/><br/>Arvuutin offers a fast paced and fun trivia-experience for all people!

The tile distribution ranges from having all sides represent the same planet to having up to 6 different planets represented.   Players are randomly assigned exclusive planets that they need to score points for.  On their turn, they will first perform a preliminary action in which they place or rotate a tile.  Next, they perform a primary action by placing a tile and calculating the resulting score.  The scores increase exponentially as more planets are matched at one time.  Players discard one card at the end of their turn and then draw back up to the hand limit (3 for 2-4 players, 4 for solitaire).  The game ends when the planet tile draw deck is exhausted.

Star Fox was the first game to be equipped with the Super FX chip, which is used to create the 3D graphical style with use of polygons, which couldn't be done with the basic SNES Hardware.<br/><br/>In the game the player is Fox McCloud, captain of the four-headed Star Fox team. The team has to defeat the evil Andross, by fighting their way through the Lylat system to Andross' home planet Venom. While the player only controls Fox McCloud and his Arwing, the other team members take part in the battle as well, and request for help from the player sometimes.<br/><br/>The player can choose between three different routes from the home planet Corneria to the enemy planet Venom. These routes differ in difficulty. Some levels take place over a planet, others take place in space. All the members of the Star Fox team fly in an Arwing. An Arwing's main weapon is a laser beam-like weapon. This weapon can be improved by finding upgrades hidden in the levels. A secondary weapon are nova bombs. They are limited in supply, but can be found throughout the levels as well.<br/><br/>While the game is in many ways a Rail Shooter, the player has some freedom of movement. The main progress of the Arwing through the level is automatic, but the Arwing can be moved vertically and horizontally, which is needed to aim. Apart from that the player has the possibility to brake or accelerate. This can be used to dodge enemy attacks and flying objects, or to get certain upgrades. Bonusses can be received by flying through a series of gates or rings present in some levels.<br/><br/>The game has inspired sequels on Nintendo 64, Gamecube and Nintendo DS.<br/><br/>"}, "68991": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Live a Live", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"23364": "Super famicon version"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic723857.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2281": "Cyberpunk"}, "usersrated": "6", "average": "8.33333", "videogamegenre": {"2155": "RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4440": "SNES"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic723857_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/>One of Square's less known RPGs for the SNES; Live A Live was never released in the West.

Every five years the people would elect one of the Princes to lead the land for the next five years. Before the election, the Princes would hold a series of debates in which they would demonstrate why they were most fit to lead for the next five years. The debates were always reviewed by the three major newspapers and typically two of the papers' editors would agree that one of the Princes won the debate while the third paper's editor would choose someone else as the clear victor. In the end, the people would vote and a new leader would rule peacefully for another five years.<br/><br/>Election Day takes great advantage of the structure of the Decktet cards. There are 6 suits with 2 suits on each card. Each suit represents a prince. Each player plays one card face up on their turn until all players pass, ending the debate. The suit appearing most frequently during the debate keeps two of its highest point cards as influence points until the end of the game. The next most frequently appearing suit keeps one of its highest point cards until the end of the game. After all the debates, the influence cards accumulated are added up and the suit with the most influence indicates who the winning prince is.
