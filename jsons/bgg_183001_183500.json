The basic rules are 40 pages long, with charts, markers/templates, an example of play, and conversion information for 1/1200 scale. The Under Both Flags module is included and adds six scenarios, a scenario generator, and log sheets for the ships. There are over 1000 log sheets representing almost every ship involved in the American Civil War and a number of forts and shore batteries. Sets of 1/1200 scale counters in PDF format are available separately for use instead of miniatures.<br/><br/>Players may fight historical battles using one of the 6 scenarios provided or create their own using the scenario generator. Game length will vary depending on the number of ships used and scenario victory conditions. Most scenarios played at conventions with multiple players last 3 to 5 hours. <br/> The game uses D10s for resolving combat and other actions. Usually you will only need one or two dice but more will be required for most damage checks. D6 dice are used to record momentum for each ship. A player aid and a sheet of markers/templates will need to be printed out for use. As with most miniatures based systems any flat playing surface can be used and a ruler or measuring tape is required for checking range and movement.<br/><br/>The turn sequence is straightforward; it starts with writing speed orders for the turn (how fast the ship will go for the turn), followed by combat (cannon fire, musket fire, boarding/melee), then movement, and finally morale checks and repairs.<br/><br/>"}, "183031": {"rpgitemversion": {"283174": "First Edition"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "The Search for Grubba the Hutt", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2643864.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"1010": "Star Wars"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"162": "Science Fiction (Space Opera)"}, "rpg": {"28075": "Star Wars Missions"}, "rpgcategory": {"2136": "Solitaire Adventure"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2643864_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Grubba the Hutt is missing ... and Jabba the Hutt is angry.

The design of the cards looks similar to Bohnanza in this respect.<br/><br/>The difference is the way cards are distributed. The active player draws a hand of cards from the draw deck, drawing the number of players plus one. They choose an opponent and pass them a seed card face-down in secret. That player has three options: to either plant it face-up in their own field, or place it face-up in the Storehouse in front of the active player, or pass it face-down to another player who is still in the round (who then has the same options but cannot pass it back). Once a player plants a seed card in a field, they are out for the round. Eventually, all the other players will have planted a seed card, or added the seed card to a field with that crop. The active player is left to choose their seed card from what is left in their hand or what is in the Storehouse (which can store 2 cards). The remaining card is discarded. The turn passes left to the new active player.<br/><br/>If a player has their two fields occupied, and has to plant a seed which does not match the two crops, they must harvest one crop. As well as the seed cards, there are manure cards which act as Jokers. Planted cards are staggered to show how many are in a field, so any Manure cards go at the back of the stagger.<br/><br/>Play ends when the active player cannot draw enough cards to distribute. The player with the most money winds, ties are broken by owning the most of the rarest plants.<br/><br/>So whilst Tanemaki has obvious connections to Bohnanza, the game play is calculated and based on hand management from the card draft, and no bartering is involved.<br/><br/>The 2nd edition includes English rules.

ISIS intended to secure this border town to make it easier for their volunteers to enter Syria from Turkey. But, like many battles, it was a battle that need not to have occurred. ISIS volunteers had entered from Turkey from many crossing points but the one difference was its close proximity to the ISIS capital of Raqqa. It was that reason that ISIS decided to fight a more conventional battle this time. It seemed like a sure win as up to 4000 ISIS soldiers gradually descended upon the Kobani area along with some 25\u201030 AFVs from captured Iraqi booty when Iraq allowed the city of Mosul to fall. These AFV's, American M1 and T\u201072M were still formidable weapons even in inexperienced hands and add to this numerous artillery guns from war booty, and ISIS was almost assured a victory. But like at Stalingrad in WW2, where the Russians refused to be defeated, the Kurdish YPG Peshmerga felt the same. Kobani had been in Kurdish hands and as ISIS swept many Kurdish towns into their hands and slaughtered them, the Kurds decided to make a stand.<br/><br/>A map hex is 550 yards across. Each unit represents a 100 men and each turn represents one week. The game lasts from Oct 1 to Jan 15. Leaders represent a single person, while AFVs represent 5 five tanks. Artillery units represent one battery of 4-6 guns.<br/><br/>"}, "183161": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Legion (Issue 11 - Dec 2014)", "rpgproducer": {"17133": "John Foody"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2647842.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"1647": "Legion"}, "rpg": {"2775": "Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (3rd Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"283378": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2647842_t.jpg", "description": "Legion<br/>A Warpstone Publication<br/>Issue 11 - December 2014<br/><br/>"}, "183162": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Don't Look Now - The Extra Bits (Apr 2005)", "rpgproducer": {"16444": "Clive Oldfield"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2647844.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"1269": "Warpstone"}, "rpg": {"2775": "Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (3rd Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"283380": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2647844_t.jpg", "description": "From the issue:<br/><br/>The following text contains a number of sections from [rpgarticle=24846], the scenario we published in Warpstone issue 23.

Massive megacorporations dominate the economic landscape and incredible advances in technology make the most miraculous things possible, from genetic modification to medical nanotechnology and microfusion power generators. But the most earth-shaking development of the 21st century is one we're only beginning to see the ramifications of. As the 22nd century dawns, the inner and outer worlds of SlipSpace are opening up to human exploration, thanks to the development of the amazing vehicles known as SlipShips.<br/><br/>The bold explorers who pilot these vehicles are called DayTrippers, and they face a multiverse of physical and psychological dangers to bring back priceless knowledge and powerful artifacts from far-flung dimensions and times.

Included are the freedom bomber, an alchemist archetype with an explosive twist on the mutagen, and which specializes in using bombs and demolishing buildings to get his message across, the voice of the revolution, a bard archetype with glorious ideals of a free society, who proves that the pen is mightier than the sword with stirring declarations that can be spread throughout the populace to win their hearts and minds, the street fighter, a brawler archetype who incites widespread violence wherever he goes, and is always looking for a reason to get into a scrap, the minuteman, a gunslinger archetype with a militia background who knows how to strike fast and hard, and disappear before the enemy can regroup, and the face of the revolution, a swashbuckler archetype with a dashing flair and a heroic persona, which allows them to inspire the populace while at the same time avoiding retribution from those they fight.<br/><br/>Whether you're about to embark on a politically-themed campaign (such as the official Paizo adventure path focusing on revolution), or you just want a selection of exciting new abilities for passionate and freedom-loving PCs, this book has lots of tantalizing options to offer. Even GMs can get in on the fun, as several of the archetypes here are perfect for rebellious villains as well, and can make for exciting and memorable encounters.<br/><br/>"}, "183243": {"poll": {}, "name": "Lighthouse Adventure", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2653376_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"30463": {"name": "Marbushka"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2653376.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"283501": "Multilingual first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "The lonely dweller of the lighthouse was sailing back to his lookout packed with food when a huge, all-consuming storm started.

They have a few plots of land, an old crushpad, a tiny cellar, and three workers. They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.<br/><br/>The players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There's competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.<br/><br/>Fortunately for the players, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful.<br/><br/>Using those workers and visitors, players can expand their vineyards by building structures, planting vines (vine cards), and filling wine orders (wine order cards). Players work towards the goal of running the most successful winery in Tuscany.<br/><br/>Viticulture - Essential Edition comes with components for Viticulture, but adds some of the expansions from Tuscany, including 36 Mama &amp; Papa cards, Field cards (previously known as &quot;Properties&quot;), expanded/revised Visitors, and 24 Automa cards (solo variant), along with a couple of minor rule changes.<br/><br/>Card Totals<br/><br/>The Viticulture Essential Edition contains 154 cards at the 44 x 67 mm size and 88 cards at the 63 x 88 mm size.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"335706": "Brazilian first edition"}, "average": "8.17051", "name": "Viticulture Essential Edition", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "6430", "boardgameaccessory": {"156417": "Viticulture: Custom Metal Lira Coins"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5666": "Solitaire Games"}}, "183395": {"rpg": {"18223": "Broken Urthe"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Broken Urthe Creature Guide", "rpgproducer": {"8541": "Djeryv Tar"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2655010.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"283707": "PDF Version"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2655010_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>The Broken Urthe - Creature Guide is a supplement to the Broken Urthe role-playing game.

You have a stack of cards that represent coffee orders, several coffee &ldquo;ingredients&rdquo; and a playing area, which is a tablet on a dome shaped foot. The name part &ldquo;balance&rdquo; comes from the way it&rsquo;s played. You draw a card from the deck which tells you, if you need to place a straight coffee, a coffee-to-go, a Milk Coffee or one of the 2 Macchiato versions on the tablet. There is a grid on said tablet to determine the places where you can, but on a coffee to go you can stack another coffee if you like. Whoever tips the tablet over loses. Besides the usual red cards, there are also green ones in the deck. These give you the opportunity to order somebody else to place the coffee (with a green cup), of course on their own risk.<br/><br/>2.Speed Order Caf&eacute;<br/>This speed game needs at least 2 baristas and 1 customer. The customer shuffles the deck of cards and pulls 5 into her hand. She than reads them aloud to the baristas. After all 5 orders are read the customer gives the start sign, and all baristas start to assemble the coffees in order. Whoever is fastest stops the game.

In this first version of the game, you will have a warrior and a magician. Later, there will be several classes added to the game. When choosing your class, chose the one that most represents you as a character. Each class has its own completely unique combat style, that has some vital statistics which will influence the performance during battle.<br/><br/>Cards are the key element in Mastery: Become a Hero. Careful selection of the cards when constructing your deck will allow you to create complex and devastating strategies. Mastery cards belong to three types/categories:<br/><br/>1. Actions and Magic: these are the cards used to construct your deck, they characterize your characters combat style and skill.<br/>2. Objects: treasures that you will collect through out Mastery &ndash; become a hero. They influence your combat strategies but you cannot include them in your deck: they are placed, face down, beside the game table.<br/>3. Equipment: weapons and armor. They have special effects which influence your strategies. As with Objects, they cannot be part of your deck: they are instead placed, face up, beside the game table.<br/><br/>Each match round takes place through five simultaneous phases;  Turn's beginning &rsaquo; Card drawing &rsaquo; Movement  &rsaquo; Combat  &rsaquo; Turn's End. You have to choose you cards for the whole combat round in advance and your cannot change any cards after the round has started. In the world of Mastery, the deck is representing your character profile. Constructing your character profile is here summarized within these three rules:<br/><br/>1. The character profile must be formed by no less than 30 cards and no more than 50.<br/>2. You can only include cards marked with the class your character belongs to (exceptions are possible on some game variations).<br/>3. Object and Equipment cards should not be part of your deck. But you can choose and bring with you to a match 2 object cards, placed down beside the board. You can freely select Equipment cards as long as the total number of occupancy (parameter written on the Equipment card) for all the equipment chosen is equal to or less than 5.<br/><br/>The combat rounds continue until either of the champions has fallen and the winner has become a hero!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"283749": "First edition"}, "age": "14", "name": "Mastery: Become a Hero", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2664": "Deck / Pool Building"}, "average": "8", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "183416": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Unusual Townsfolk", "rpgproducer": {"65375": "Curtis Baum"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2651239.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"283750": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"28133": "Extras!"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2651239_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>There are common villagers and then there are unusual townfolk.

You control a team of highly-trained animals, from crocodiles to zebras, in a Kung Fu battle against your rivals. Who will be tonight&rsquo;s champions of the zoo? Grab some dice and find out!<br/><br/>In Kung Fu Zoo, players use six-sided animal dice to do battle in an enclosed arena. There are two gameplay variants: Cage Battle and Points Match. In either variant, players start with a team of dice-animals. But the similarities stop there. In a Cage Battle, players take turns flicking their animals into the arena. Your goal is to knock your opponent&rsquo;s animals onto their backs (stunning them) or through holes on the board (the &ldquo;cages&rdquo;). You win the match when all of your opponent&rsquo;s animals are stunned or in cages. The first player to win three matches wins! In a Points Match, players take turns flicking their animals into the arena. Your goal is to score 21 points before your opponent. Points are awarded at the end of each round, based upon the position of your dice that are left on the board.<br/><br/>"}, "183421": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3092906.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"73788": {"name": "Manny O'Donnell"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "99", "boardgamepublisher": {"221": {"name": "WizKids"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3092906_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"2650": {"name": "Aviation / Flight"}}, "description": "The Air Elemental Zephrylos is the competitive prize for Month 2 of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Attack Wing Organized Play Tournament, Elemental Evil.
