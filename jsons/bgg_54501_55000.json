Sure, the city has a history of attracting criminal groups, corrupt merchants, and politicians&mdash;to say nothing of subversive cults dedicated to insane and dreadful gods&mdash;but it's the pirates who infest the city and prowl the Serpent's Teeth that give the City of Adventure its dubious reputation. From its first founding as a haven for buccaneers and cutthroats, established on the pirate's code to attain an uneasy peace between voyages, Freeport has evolved from a filthy little town to a sprawling city of thousands. Yet in that time, pirates remain the most common and most popular of its citizens.<br/><br/>Buccaneers of Freeport returns to Freeport's roots and examines the colorful and disturbing rogues that roam the seas around the City of Adventure. Describing eight pirates, many new, some infamous, in lavish detail, each entry explores the rogue's history, his or her goals and agendas, while hinting at the curse that keeps them at sea and the treasures they guard. In addition, the pirate's key crewmen receive extensive attention, presenting them in all their cunning and brutality to breathe life into the thrill-seeking corsairs. Finally, the pirate ship, allies, and enemies round out the chapter, culminating with a campaign framework to help you build adventures centered on these various characters.<br/><br/>The buccaneers described in this sourcebook include:<br/><br/><br/>     Three Sheets Kimbal: An adventurous and courageous corsair famed for his curious relationship with Lady Luck.<br/>     Scarbelly: The dread orc captain of the Bloody Vengeance, despised and feared by all for his brutality and viciousness.<br/>     Alfhild: A renegade warrior-maiden turned pirate to escape an arranged marriage and the duties of her homeland.<br/>     Flynn the Quick: An ambitious privateer that seeks redemption by wiping out piracy in all its forms.<br/>     Get o' Yarash: A disturbing ship filled with crude and violent mutants and exiles dedicated to the bloodthirsty god Yarash.<br/>     Aesha Algosi&eacute;l: A beautiful but cruel elf maiden who scours the seas for lost relics of occult power.<br/>     Xian-Lei: Driven by vengeance and saddled with a dreadful curse, Xian-Lei prowls the seas waging war on those he blames for the death of his order.<br/>     Scevola Hest: Cursed to sail the seas for all time on the ghostly vessel named the Black Contessa, Hest and his spectral crew strike against any they please.<br/><br/><br/>Buccaneers of Freeport is a game sourcebook designed for all roleplaying games.

So, can you find the right balance between the ferocious partisan war of the wilderness and the more &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; style of war as practiced in Europe?  If so, then perhaps the Marquis de Montcalm, with his French battalions, can stave off his more numerous enemies to the south; perhaps New France can survive the tempest of war.<br/><br/>As the English, you, too, have a difficult &ldquo;balancing&rdquo; act to master; you must find a way to placate and protect your fiercely independent, but extremely valuable Colonials.  Without their numbers and forest craft, you stand little chance of besting the potent combination of &ldquo;unmitigated savages&rdquo; from the Lakes, Mission Indians from the St. Lawrence Valley, Canadian bush rangers, and French battalions which will be coming at you in waves.  Ask too much of the Americans; do too little on their behalf; treat them with disrespect; they will turn a deaf ear to your entreaties and allow the British Regulars to march off to certain defeat out there, at the hands of a foe who is covered &ldquo;by the universal forest.&rdquo;<br/><br/>And, facing both of you, is &ldquo;an immense uninhabited wilderness, overgrown everywhere with trees and brushwood, so that nowhere can one see twenty yards.&rdquo;  This vast, uncharted forest dominates the struggle.  Ultimately, victory will only go to that player who can conquer that savage landscape stretching out before him.

After a summons to Winterhaven, the characters find a land locked in ice, and an old ally in need of aid.

To do so, place a lemming card face down on top of your stack of bet cards; goal is to place winner on TOP of your stack (last bet placed).<br/><br/>The game ends when a lemming reaches the finish; place remaining lemmings in the order they are on the track. Mission cards score bonus VP if completed, or cost VP if failed. Then resolve bets: turn over your cards, then go through them getting 1 VP per card revealed until you get to winning lemming (max 6 VP).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"33354": "Dutch version"}, "average": "6.20403", "name": "Lemming Mafia", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "age": "8", "usersrated": "791", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}}, "54736": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Kids are All Right", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic544512_t.jpg", "average": "3", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"6557": {"name": "Vivid Imaginations"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic544512.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"119425": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1072": {"name": "Electronic"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "An electronic board game based on the BBC show of the same name.

All of these failed in the face of a country where it seemed every man carried an assault rifle, and the world surrendered Somalia to the whims of bandits and rogue militias.<br/>Did it have to end that way? Somalia gave the finest troops in the world the chance to make a difference, but they left the country as embattled as when they arrived.

At the end of each game, players with cards left in their hands receive 1 point per card.  When a player receives 15 points, that player is out of the game.  Once it is down to 2 players, the player with the fewest points wins (as the game is no fun with only 2 players, since you know what cards the opponent has).<br/><br/>"}, "54884": {"rpgitemversion": {"10579": "First printing"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Arkham Sanitarium", "rpgproducer": {"24511": "Elaine Fuller"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic545126.jpg", "usersrated": "9", "rpgsetting": {"2572": "Cthulhu Classic (1920s & 1930s)"}, "average": "5.94444", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"310": "Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpggenre": {"988": "Horror (Cthulhu Mythos)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic545126_t.jpg", "description": "From the inside cover:<br/><br/>While combating the forces of the mythos, investigators are often exposed to hideous horror and blasphemous secrets that drive them into the embrace of insanity.

The PDF rulebook is available for free download. The game consists of four pages of rules and a double-sided set of character sheets.<br/><br/>From a rough automated translation of the rules introduction:<br/><br/>&quot;For the first time in over six hundred years, there is an uncertain peace in continent Latvari. The two rivals Hohenstahl and Novrikia have put down their arms after a ten-year long destructive war. Both sides agreed that it had gone too far when their Orkish mercenaries were beginning to run riot in eastern Latvari, and decided therefore to a cease-fire and freeze of the front lines. For the first time in six hundred years guns, rifles and machine guns are silent.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Although neither side can afford to keep their armies in the field of peace and the majority of armies have been released, air fleets still patrol borders, oceans and colonies. In particular the old enemies Hohenstahl and Novrikia keep an eye on each other. The new air guns also have been released, which has put a bit of problem for the young, brave and noble pilots now have nothing to do. They entertain themselves instead of all sorts pastime as flight contests different kinds, and hits on flight clubs, hunting castle and other places of society, where they can abreact itself. It is also an excellent place for spies and agents to intermingle, and the center for the eternal intrigue in the social upper circuits. And there are plenty of both: in the fragile peace so is to provide gain as much advantage as possible.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;But there are concerns. Novrikia and Hohenstahl have not been released on garden, and both are looking for an excuse and an opportunity to fly at each other again. Elves and Dwarves think, as usual, not on each other. Kerosene depots are vital for all who want an air fleet or air force, and without air fleet and air force we have nothing to set against an enemy who has them. Kerosene is used to operate most aircraft, from Dwarven rockets to Orkish pulse jet engines and the usual aircraft. Even the large magnetic air battleship machines are powered by kerosene, but they can also be powered by conventional coal-fired steam turbines. Only the Elven flight beasts are not propelled by kerosene  - they eat meat instead. For all others, kerosene is a constant object for quarrels and fights.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The rumor that Eastern Orcs, dangerous, brutal and more skilled than their cousins in the West, have their own plans. Rumors say an evil to the east is being awakened again after six hundred years of rest.&quot; <br/> &quot;It is at this time, in 1906 in the Fourth Age, which our story takes its beginning.&quot;<br/><br/>And the original Swedish rules introduction:<br/><br/>F&ouml;r f&ouml;rsta g&aring;ngen p&aring; &ouml;ver sexhundra &aring;r s&aring; r&aring;der en os&auml;ker fred p&aring; kontinenten Latvari. De b&aring;da rivalerna Hohenstahl och Novrikia har lagt ner vapnen efter ett tio &aring;r l&aring;ngt och destruktivt krig. B&aring;da sidorna kom &ouml;verens om att det hade g&aring;tt f&ouml;r l&aring;ngt n&auml;r deras orchiska legosoldater hade b&ouml;rjar h&auml;rja i &ouml;stra Latvari, och beslutade sig d&auml;rf&ouml;r f&ouml;r att utlysa eld upph&ouml;r och frysa gr&auml;nserna vid d&aring;varande linjer. F&ouml;r f&ouml;rsta g&aring;ngen p&aring; sexhundra &aring;r s&aring; &auml;r kanonerna, gev&auml;ren och kulsprutorna tysta.<br/><br/>&Auml;ven om ingen sida har r&aring;d att h&aring;lla sina arm&eacute;er i f&auml;lt i fredstid och majoriteten av h&auml;rarna har hemf&ouml;rlovats s&aring; patrullerar fortfarande luftflottorna gr&auml;nserna, haven och kolonierna. I synnerhet de gamla fienderna Hohenstahl och Novrikia h&aring;ller &ouml;gonen p&aring; varandra. De nya flygvapnen har ocks&aring; hemf&ouml;rlovats, vilket har st&auml;llt till lite problem f&ouml;r de unga, modiga och adliga piloterna som nu inte har n&aring;gonting att g&ouml;ra. Dessa roar sig ist&auml;llet med allehanda tidsf&ouml;rdriv som flygt&auml;vlingar av olika slag och tr&auml;ffar p&aring; flygklubbar, jaktslott och andra societetsst&auml;llen, d&auml;r de kan avreagera sig. Det &auml;r ocks&aring; ett ypperligt st&auml;lle f&ouml;r spioner och agenter att beblanda sig, och centrum f&ouml;r eviga intriger i de sociala &ouml;vre kretsarna. Och det finns gott om b&aring;da: i den br&auml;ckliga freden s&aring; g&auml;ller det att tillf&ouml;rskaffa sig s&aring; mycket f&ouml;rdelar som m&ouml;jligt.<br/><br/>Men det finns orosmoln. Novrikia och Hohenstahl har inte sl&auml;ppt p&aring; garden, och b&aring;da letar efter en urs&auml;kt och en m&ouml;jlighet att flyga p&aring; varandra igen. Alver och dv&auml;rgar tycker som vanligt inte om varandra. Kerosindep&aring;er &auml;r livsviktiga f&ouml;r alla som vill ha en luftflotta eller ett flygvapen, och utan luftflotta och flygvapen s&aring; har man ingenting att s&auml;tta emot en fiende som har dem. Kerosin anv&auml;nds f&ouml;r att driva det mesta, fr&aring;n dv&auml;rgiska raketer till orchiska pulsjetmotorer och vanliga flygplan. Till och med de stora luftslagskeppens magnetiska maskiner drivs av kerosin, men de kan &auml;ven drivas av vanliga koleldade &aring;ngturbiner. Det &auml;r i princip bara alvernas flygbestar som inte drivs av kerosin &ndash; de &auml;ter k&ouml;tt ist&auml;llet. F&ouml;r alla andra s&aring; &auml;r kerosin ett konstant f&ouml;rem&aring;l f&ouml;r os&auml;mja och br&aring;k.<br/><br/>Det ryktas om att ostorcherna, farligare, grymmare och mer kompetenta &auml;n deras kusiner i v&auml;st, har sina egna planer. Det ryktas om en ondska i &ouml;ster som h&aring;ller p&aring; att vakna till liv igen efter sexhundra &aring;rs vila.<br/><br/>Det &auml;r i denna tid, &aring;r 1906 i Fj&auml;rde &aring;ldern, som v&aring;r saga tar sin b&ouml;rjan.<br/><br/>"}, "54959": {"boardgamedesigner": {"24643": {"name": "Miles Ratcliffe"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Judgment", "playingtime": "150", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic588964_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"24643": "Miles Ratcliffe"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"772": {"name": "(Unpublished)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic588964.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"190411": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "150", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "150", "description": "Judgment is a board game created by Miles Ratcliffe and, although some thought by Chaos Publishing Ltd. has been put into to publishing the game, it is not due to be published any time soon.<br/><br/>'Prepare to step into a whole new fantasy world full of magic and adventure as you battle your way through your quests like never before.<br/><br/>On a distant world, far from our reach, there was land full of magic and prosperity; where the just had ruled over the corrupt for many a millennia.

Some of them have hobbies that keep them busy, while others just stare at the ceiling.<br/><br/>Jhonen Vasquez&rsquo; comic Jhonny The Homicidal Maniac probably played into this a little bit too, especially with the imaginary friends. Anyway, this game is a &ldquo;solo RPG,&rdquo; which admittedly is kind of an oxymoron. But I figured that if I&rsquo;m going to make a game about antisocial shut-ins, it ought to be a game you could play by yourself. In this game you&rsquo;ll be rolling dice (you&rsquo;ll need plenty of ten-sided dice) and following instructions to generate events, making some choices about those and rolling a few more dice, and then writing a fictional diary entry based on the results. Out of necessity it&rsquo;s not as open-ended as a normal RPG, but then it&rsquo;s mostly a writing exercise. You can write on paper, type them up, or put them in a blog. Needless to say I&rsquo;m curious what the results will be like, but you can do whatever you want with them.<br/><br/>By default, the game ends after your character goes through seven unusually eventful days. One of the ways in which it&rsquo;s like a typical RPG is that there isn&rsquo;t any particular way to &ldquo;win.&rdquo; If you want your character to get out of his rut and rejoin society, or stay the same, or kill himself, or whatever, you can try to steer him that way, but a lot of stuff will come down to how the dice fall. The real game is turning all this nonsense into coherent writing.<br/><br/>"}, "54972": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Dragon (Issue 123 - Jul 1987)", "rpgproducer": {"17134": "Mike Cook"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic545873.jpg", "usersrated": "4", "average": "6.5", "rpgissue": {"1221": "Dragon"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"44913": "Arcane Lore: A new column of spells and enchantments"}, "rpg": {"191": "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (1st Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"10658": "Softcover Magazine"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic545873_t.jpg", "description": "Vol. XII No. 2 of Dragon Magazine.<br/><br/>Cover Art: On the night of a full moon, two youths forge a sword of great magical power - a flame tongue, perhaps, or a blade of elemental force.
