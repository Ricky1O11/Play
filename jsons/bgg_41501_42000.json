This is a game of story telling as well, because beyond the generic encounter the investigators will  be able to interact with the system in several ways: bribing, buying, paying, taking buses, walking, fighting, healing. Also there is the mechanic of Day and Night that make the encounters relevant both in information and in danger.<br/><br/>All the stories will be written so they lead to a thrilling conclusion and each event will have as much atmosphere as possible. Players will feel as their investigator is wounded and need to move to the hospital, or if they need to reach to someplace at a specific time of the day to retrieve some information. Still finishing a story won't mean to render that story useless. Since the puzzle the investigators have to complete is random, the replayability is unlimited.<br/><br/>The nights in the Twilight City are very dangerous but there is no time to waste for the evil forces are always plotting for the doomsday and if you take too much time you will certainly fail.<br/><br/>The board has generic places that will be referred in the events with their own names.

It is the Norfolk and Western, which on the Rail Baron board serves Norfolk, Cincinnati, and Columbus destinations. It is interesting that the present-day Norfolk Southern is one of the few &quot;Class 1&quot; super-major railroads coming out of the merger period, but the railroad it owes it's heritage to is the one missing in this game.<br/><br/>Rail Baron has 67 destination cities on the board and in the payoff table. Chattanooga Choo-Choo II has only 25 of those cities included in the card deck. The destination cards show which rail lines serve that city. Cities cards are dealt to the players at the beginning. The object is to collect railroads (by bidding for them) such that at the end of the game, the player maximizes the connections with his cities.<br/><br/>The cities chosen to be included are generally those larger hubs with multiple rail connections. Cities in Rail Baron that are only served by one or two railroads are eliminated in the Chattanooga Choo-Choo II deck.

Also missing is Dallas, the home of BGG.<br/><br/>Game components consist of printed adhesive labels (&quot;Avery&quot; type) stuck on basic face cards, one blue and one red deck, and a set of simple plastic chips that act as currency for the bidding.

When mankind gained the means to transit the vastness of space safely and quickly, a great human wave extended across the galaxy, and humans soon inhabited thousands of worlds.<br/><br/>Communities of worlds formed alliances; alliances became federations, and eventually a galactic empire was born. That empire existed for millennia, growing and consolidating, bringing most of the inhabited worlds under its control.<br/><br/>Despite its size and apparent success, though, all is not well in the Galactic Empire. There are rebels, usurpers, those who want to create empires of their own, and aliens of every imaginable form. Over the long millennia, even the form of man is taking a new shape with genetic engineering.<br/><br/>Struggle for the Galactic Empire is a solitaire science fiction game. You assume leadership of the forces of the Galactic Empire as it strives to maintain and expand its dominion while fighting off the forces of chaos that seek to destroy it. You make all the military, political, social and economic decisions to deal with the threats that arise, keep the far-flung empire stable, and still expand and bring new glory through discovery, colonization and conquest.<br/><br/>The map shows the entire galaxy divided into sectors of star systems. Production is carried out by nano-assemblers to create starships and world-sized weapons. Units include combat and colonization ships, control groups and leaders. Units have two types of combat values: weapons and morphogenetic systems. Weapons destroy the enemy, while morphogenetic systems change them into friends. Loyalties switch back and forth depending on the situation.<br/><br/>Threats are generated by over 100 randomly drawn chaos markers. They include: rebels, usurpers, independent empires, invaders and alien forces, as well as technological, economic, social, political and military events.

There are also 2 &quot;Intelex&quot; cards which act as jokers/wild cards.  Rules for 4 games are included:<br/><br/>Word Rummy: Deal 10 each for 2 players, 7 each for 3-4, 6 each for 5-6.  In a turn, a player draws 1 from the draw or discard pile, lays down words, adds letters to others' words, and discards 1.  The player who goes out scores the total of the letters' values in front of him; the others subtract the values of letters still in hand.<br/><br/>Discovery: Hangman for 4 players.  Deal out the whole deck (without the Intelex cards).  Each player makes a word out of his cards and lays them face down in a row, with his word spelled in order among them.  In a turn, a player repeatedly asks 1 other player if they have a specific letter; if they do, they expose all copies of that letter they have.  The turn ends when a request fails.  During a turn one may also guess what a word is: if wrong, he loses 5 point; if right, he gets the word's score and the guess-ee is out for the hand, which ends when all words are discovered.  One may bluff and have no word; if that is correctly the guesser gets 20 points.<br/><br/>Solitaire: Like Klondike.  Deal out 7 stacks of cards, of heights 1, 2 ... 7, the top card of each face up.  Move cards around to form words and word fragments, removing words as they are formed, exposing face-down cards as revealed, filling blank spots with letters or fragments.  Then go through the deck 3 cards at a time, combining letters as before.  The goal is to use up the whole deck.<br/><br/>Poker: For 2 to 7.  Deal 5 per player.  Each in turn may exchange any or all of their cards for an equal number from the deck, and make their best word.  Highest-scoring word wins.

Devacurse presents a universe rent asunder by the warfare of rival gods.  Once-calm seas roil with the venom of serpentine nagas, Yaksas leave villages burning in their molten wake, and fearsome Himmapan creatures bellow their fury at the world of men.  Noble heroes, stately Garuda warriors, cunning Monkey lords, and treacherous demons lead their forces into battle in this epic conflict drawn from the lush imagination of Southeast Asian mythology.<br/><br/>Read on to learn about Devacurse&rsquo;s setting, and what this ongoing journal has in store for curious English-speaking gamers.<br/><br/>Players take on the roles of Devas, divine entities commanding the elements of earth, wood, fire, metal, water, and wind.  You will need to master them to defeat your opponent, a god just as powerful and determined to rule as you.  Whether you incarnate directly on the battlefield as a hero or bombard your enemy from afar with devastating incantations, you will need wits as well as strength to survive.<br/><br/>Bless your warriors, summon allies, and commit your forces wisely in the ultimate contest of skill and intellect.  In Devacurse there can be no middle ground.<br/><br/>The winner will inherit a universe; the loser, cold oblivion.<br/><br/>Background:<br/><br/>Devacurse was born from the imagination of Dr. Eiamchan Srithanon and his design team, the 6 Devabrothers:  SrithaNa Eiamchan and Mr. Korn (rules team and card designers), Sarit Chareonpanichkul (art director and trophy model sculptor) and Veerawat Jangpetch (art director), Saranyu (story director and character designer), and Srichai Eiamchan (production).  SrithaNa, Korn, Veerawat, and Saranyu were still studying architecture at King Mongkut&rsquo;s University of Technology Thonburi (KMIT) at the time, and art director Sarit was brought in from outside to complete the team.  Dr. Srithanon and his friends had been avid card gamers for years, but after seeing fellow Thais playing endless Western and Japanese imports, they decided it was time to create a distinctively Thai collectable card game.  Their goal was amibitious - Dr. Eiamchan and his team wanted to create a card game that didn&rsquo;t just feature Thai themes or look Thai, but one whose game mechanics embodied Thai style.  Two years of development and playtesting followed, and in 2007 Devacurse came on the market with an initial base set release, Half Blood Deal.  This was followed in 2008 with the first expansion set, Vengeful Kindred.<br/><br/>Devacurse immediately impressed Thai players with its high production values, elegant design, and lavish artwork, with many comparing its high level of presentation to that of Wizards of the Coast&rsquo;s Magic the Gathering.  Currently Devacurse commissions work from over 30 professional artists in Thailand.  Once players learned the rules, they were impressed again by supple game mechanics that rewarded tactical planning and captured the essence of Thai culture.  Specifically, the game strongly recalls the fantastical world of the Thai Ramayana painted on the walls of the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, in the Royal Palace complex in Bangkok.  It also subtly incorporates elements of Thai Buddhist prayer and Samsara, the cycle of reincarnation, into the structure of play.<br/><br/>The Devacurse card layout incorporates elements of Thai Buddhist and Hindu cosmology.<br/><br/>Devacurse is a sophisticated and still-evolving piece of genuinely Thai pop culture in a country that is often swamped by Western and Japanese influence, imports, and imitations.  Dr. Srithanon and his team are committed to bringing the legends of their heritage to life in the game, and the results so far have been unique and beguiling.<br/><br/>Devacurse is currently published only in Thai, and has therefore been limited to Thai audiences.  This website aims to open up the world of Devacurse to English-speaking gamers and enthusiasts of Thai culture and Southeast Asian myth.  In the coming weeks and months I will be putting up a complete English translation of the Devacurse rulebook, followed by English translations of all of the current Devacurse cards (Half Blood Deal through Vengeful Kindred).  There will be an in-depth review of the game, and other articles on a variety of subjects (card spotlight, deck design, strategy, back story) will hopefully follow.<br/><br/>If all goes well, determined English speakers should be able to play and enjoy the Thai edition of Devacurse with the information posted on this website, until such a time as Devacurse is published in English.<br/><br/>Enjoy, and welcome to the epic world of Devacurse.<br/>............<br/><br/>more ....<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href='http://devacurseinenglish.wordpress.com' rel='nofollow'>http://devacurseinenglish.wordpress.com</a>  (English)<br/><br/>http:// <a target='_blank' href='http://www.devacurse.com' rel='nofollow'>www.devacurse.com</a>  (Thai)<br/><br/>"}, "41633": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Scarabeo Express", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Pattern Building", "Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Letter cube games"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic456805_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Editrice Giochi"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic456805.jpg", "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Travel", "Word Game"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "&quot;The fun of Scarabeo in twenty minutes!&quot;<br/><br/>Players roll letter dice and place them on a crossword puzzle-like grid to form words and score points.

The deck has 54 cards: 2 &quot;Sub&quot; cards which act as wild cards, and 52 cards with a letter and its value on each. Rules for 8 games are included:<br/><br/>1. Crossword Game: Deal 10 each to 2-4, 7 each to 5-7 players.  In each turn, a player lays a word from his hand to the table in a crossword fashion, the first word alone, other words intersecting the growing array.  If unable to play, a player discards 1 and draws 1 from the draw or discard pile. A hand ends when a player goes out; players add their hands' value to their scores; when a player reaches 100 the low total wins.<br/><br/>2. Word Solitaire: Lay all the cards face up in 3s, fanned so as to see all the letters.  Make and discard words from the topmost cards, though if a card is used in a word the letter just underneath it can also be used.  You win if you use all the cards.<br/><br/>3. Letter Patience: Like Klondike, deal 7 piles of heights 1-7, and turn up the top card of each.  Make and discard cards, exposing the new tops of each pile; empty spaces may be filled in with vowels.  Turn up the remainder of the deck one by one, and use the top letter of this pile with the others to make words.  You win if you use all the cards.<br/><br/>4. Crossword Solitaire A: Deal out 6 cards face up.  Use these cards to build a crossword array, one word at a time, filling empty spaces in the 6 from the remaining deck.  Then turn up that deck one at a time and continue -- you can only use the top of the turn-up pile.<br/><br/>5. Crossword Solitaire B: Similar to A, but start with a hand of 12 cards, which is not replenished; the deck is still gone through once, one card at a time.<br/><br/>6.  Anagrams: For 1-6 players.  Everyone is dealt one card.  In a turn, a player either: places his card in the center of the table; makes a word with that card and other cards in the center, placing the word in front of him; or adds the letter to an existing word, rearranging letters to make a new word, and taking the word if it belonged to someone else.  After the deck has been gone through, the player with the most points in front of him wins.<br/><br/>7.  The O-U-T Game: For 4-8 players.  All the cards are dealt face up.  In a turn a player places one card in the middle of the table, while thinking of a word of at least 9 letters that starts with all the letters placed so far.  Once such a word is finished, the player who does it gets a letter (O, U or T), the word is discarded and the process starts again.  On getting all of OUT, a player is out of the game.  A player may pass if they think they don't have a letter to add to the growing word; if someone else points out a letter and word he could do, he earns an E for excellence, which can cancel out one other letter.  Players may challenge a play that doesn't seem to lead to any word; whoever is wrong earns a penalty letter.<br/><br/>8. Guess-O-Gram: A type of hangman for any number of players.  One becomes the Thinker, thinks of a word, and lays it face down in order.  Other take turns guessing letters; if a letter is in the word it is revealed and the guesser earns 2 points per letter.  A player who guess the whole word or the last letter gets 2 points times the length of the word.

It seems likely that a certain English contempt resides in the adoption of the word hubbub from a Celtic source, which is probably related to ub ub ubub, a Scots Gaelic interjection expressing contempt, or to abu, an ancient Irish war cry. In any case, hubbub was first recorded (1555) in the phrase Irish hubbub and meant &quot;the confused shouting of a crowd.&quot; In addition to the senses it has developed, hubbub was again used, possibly in an unflattering way, by the New England colonists as a term for a rambunctious game played by Native Americans.<br/><br/>"}, "41696": {"boardgamedesigner": ["David Fisher"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Albert", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic463902_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["David Fisher"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unpublished)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic463902.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Print & Play"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "A free print and play game submitted to the &quot;four tile&quot; contest.

Its games are a slight twist on the usual rules of its rivals.<br/><br/>There are 54 cards in the deck.  52 of them have a letter and a value from 10 to 50 (the Q card actually has two letters, QU); there are also 2 jokers (wild cards) worth 100.<br/><br/>The words to 6 games are given:<br/><br/>Cross-O-Grams: For 2+ players (but if 4 or more, 2 decks are recommended).  Deal 12 each.  In a turn a player either makes a word on the table from his hand, or draws one and passes; if his hand only X, Y or Z he may discard one of those before drawing.  Words are at least 2 letters long, and after the first word, new words must intersect or extend previous words, crossword fashion.  A hand ends when a player goes out or the draw pile runs out.  The value of the cards in hand goes to the winner of the round, and the highest total wins after an agred time; or, players get their own totals in hand at the end of a round, and when one player reaches 500, the lowest total wins.<br/><br/>An-O-Grams: For 2-8 players, but use 2 decks for 4+ players. Deal 12 each.  In a turn, a player: plays a word of 3+ letters to the table in front of him; or adds 1+ letters to a word on the table to make it a new word (without changing the letters' order), taking the word to himself; or draws 1 card and passes.  Simple endings (-S, -ED, -ER) are forbidden.  The round ends when a player goes out or the deck runs out.  Each player scores the points in front of him minus the points in hand; a player who goes out before the deck runs out doubles his table points.<br/><br/>Casino-Grams: For 2-4 players.  Take out the jokers and deal 4 to each player and 4 face-up to the table.  In a turn a player plays one of his cards to the table and does one of the following: A) makes a word with it and other table cards, placing the word in front of him; B) builds toward a future word, combining 1 card with table cards, announcing the letter(s) he has that will be played later; C) steals a word from someone else by adding a letter to it and making a new word; D) leaves it on the table with the other table cards.  After the cards are played, 4 more are dealt to each player (but no more to the table), and play continues.  After all the cards are played, the one who made or stole the last word gets the remaining table cards.  Each player gets 1 point per card he has on the table; the game is won on reaching 100.<br/><br/>Cross-O-Gram Solitaire: Like Klondike, 7 piles are dealt out of height 1-7 cards, the top one exposed.  Combine the visible cards to build words into a crossword array.  When stuck, start turning the remaining deck 3 at a time and use those cards to continue.  (Or, do it 1 at a time, going through the deck only once.)  You win if you use up the whole deck.<br/><br/>Cross-O-Gram Double Solitaire: The solitaire above played with 2 players, with decks of different colored backs.  Take turns playing until you can play to the table.  The game ends when neither can add anything to the crossword, and the one with the most cards out wins.<br/><br/>Canister Solitaire: Deal the whole deck into 8 columns face-up, fanned vertically so you can see what's coming.  There will be 6 each in 4 columns, 7 each in the other 4.  Repeatedly make words only from the letters at the bottom of the columns, discarding them as they are made.

Crossword Card Game: For 2-7 players; deal 10 each for 2-4, 7 each for 5-7.  In a turn a player plays up to 4 cards to make a word (of 2+ letters) on the table.  The first word is alone, but all later words must intersect a previous word, crossword fashion.  If unable to make or extend a word, a player discards 1 card and draws 1 from the draw or discard pile.  The hand ends when a player goes out of cards; the rest add the sum of values in their hand to their running total.  When someone's total reaches 100, the lowest total wins.<br/><br/>2.  Solitaire Lettergrams:  Deal 6 cards face up, and place the rest in a pile, with the top card exposed.  Make and discard words from the face-up cards, filling in blanks from the deck.  You win if you use up all the cards.<br/><br/>3.  Lettergram Anagrams:  Spread the cards loosely on the table, face down.  In a turn, a player: draws cards (3 their first turn 2 thereafter), and either lays down a word (2+ letters), lays down a word fragment, or adds letters to a fragment, or adds letters to an existing word to make a new word.  When a player lays down a 2-letter word fragment he says what word he is aiming to make; any player may complete it.  Words that are completed or extended are placed in front of the player who did it, even if it was in front of someone else.  When all cards have been played, the player with the most words wins.<br/><br/>"}, "41732": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic459045.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Rachel Lowe"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "5", "boardgamepublisher": ["RTL Games"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic459045_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Travel"], "description": "Destination Animation takes you on a journey through the worlds of Toy Story, Monsters Inc, The Incredibles and Finding Nemo.

Kings of the Sea was developed with three major goals in mind:<br/><br/>The first of these goals was to bring House Greyjoy back into the LCG environment. From this perspective, the expansion consists of a Greyjoy deck that is similar to the out-of-the-box decks that you&rsquo;ll find in the AGoT Core set. With a mixture of both new cards and old school Greyjoy reprints (some modified and updated for the LCG environment), House Greyjoy can once again stand proudly alongside (or, if you prefer, against) Houses Stark, Lannister, Baratheon, and Targaryen in the LCG environment.<br/><br/>Secondly, I insisted on using the design of the Kings of the Sea expansion as an opportunity to address some of the context and synergy concerns noted earlier. In this product, you&rsquo;ll find numerous King and Queen characters, some new Kingdom locations, and a spattering of Military Battle, Intrigue Gambit, and Power Struggle plot cards. Additional use for crested characters is also prevalent (particularly Holy and War), and a major black hole in the AGoT LCG metagame, a realistic check on powerful locations, has been confronted.<br/><br/>Third (and not unrelated to the context and synergy discussion), we wanted this expansion to have something for everyone, even if they&rsquo;re not at all interested in House Greyjoy. Thus, each House gets at least 1 King or Queen, and the plot deck (with the exception of an important House Greyjoy only plot reprint) along with many of the neutral cards were selected as cards that could potentially be useful building blocks in the widest possible array of decks. So even a die-hard Lannister player (there aren&rsquo;t really any of those out there, are there?) should be able to find something of use in this set.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Brazilian first edition", "Chinese edition", "English first edition", "English Revised Edition", "French edition", "German first edition", "Italian first edition", "Spanish first edition", "Spanish first edition with resin house"], "average": "7.32922", "name": "A Game of Thrones: The Card Game \u2013 Kings of the Sea", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "347", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Customizable Games", "Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["A Game of Thrones LCG", "Living Card Game", "A Song of Ice and Fire"]}, "41812": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Demi-mot", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Recognition"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Habourdin International", "Waddington's Games, Inc."], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Word Game"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "The card bears syllables along their sides.

Using a shared deck of 55 Operations Cards, each player makes decisions concerning the deployment, combat and political-military operations in support of his forces and his general strategy. Orders of battle include all the historic corps/divisions (with some brigade counters) and all major generals involved in the conflict. The mapboard covers an area from Hamburg to Florence and Metz to Cracow. The system includes unique mobilization rules that reflect the difficulties of mobilizing for war while attempting to garner as many victory points before war is actually declared. Once war is declared, you must fight with the forces mobilized, so shrewd judgement is required as to what to mobilize, where those forces will operate and who commands them. Always waiting in the wings is the French 2nd Empire under Napoleon III, prepared to intervene if neither side appears able to clinch a quick and decisive victory. Other features include cavalry superiority, railroads, Prussia&rsquo;s mobilization advantage and coordinated attacks. 1866 includes two scenarios, the Mobilization to War scenario (the Campaign scenario) and the Seven Weeks War scenario (covering the post mobilization situation). The cards are sub-divided into Mobilization and War decks, which are combined after war is declared.<br/><br/>1866 is designed by John B. Firer (designer of Spartacus).

The U.S. player attempts to conquer Canadian territory and to compel Britain to sue for peace, while the British player attempts to do exactly the same against the United States, perhaps with the aid of some Native American allies. The fledgling United States are making a huge gamble. Can they drive the British from Canada and unify North America, or will the Empire strike back and put the upstarts in their place and end their dreams of &quot;manifest destiny&quot;?<br/>  Prominent military leaders, army strength points, Native American forces, and political concerns and conditions are all represented. Historically, British and U.S. forces, though sorely mismatched in terms of professionalism and leadership, fought each other to a stalemate. This game allows players not only to explore what conditions contributed to this outcome, but also whether the either might have been able to achieve a decisive victory that would have changed the shape of the North American continent. <br/> Played on an authentic early-19th-century map of the United States and Canada, 1812 includes both introductory and standard rules.

They are cloistered in the Nine Worlds (Earth and eight colonized planets) in a region called the Galactic Fringe. Even though space travel has been practical since the invention of the dual-axis hyperdrive in 2257, humankind's attempt to colonize &quot;Beyond the Boundary&quot; came to an abrupt halt in 2490. The &quot;Space Plague,&quot; a gargantuan epidemic caused by an organism of alien origin, killed more than half the humanoid population of the galaxy, threatened the extinction of civilization, and forever changed mankind's attitude towards space.<br/><br/>Now, a Space Patrol enforces the &quot;Boundary,&quot; that one-way border around the Nine Worlds in order to prevent anything like the &quot;Space Plague&quot; from ever happening again. Now, anyone may leave the area enclosed by the Boundary, but they may not return.<br/><br/>Thus far, the Boundary has proven effective in keeping ships from entering the Nine Worlds for three centuries, keeping humanity safe from the unknown. Of course, this does provide for a bit of stagnation, as well. After all, no new discoveries, no new challenges, and countless lost opportunities hardly seem compatible with a growing standard of living.

There is a deck of 52 Letter Cards -- 2 of each letter, except 1 J and Q, 3 As and Es.  On the front it has the letter and its value (1-5), and on the back it has its value and all letters of that value: <br/>1 - AEIOU<br/>2 - HLNRY<br/>3 - CSTVX<br/>4 - BDFGZ<br/>5 - JKMPQW<br/>There are also 7 Clue Cards - &quot;1st Letter&quot; thru &quot;6th Letter&quot;, and &quot;Any Letter&quot;.  The game board has 6 spaces for cards with an elastic to hold them in place, and a scoring dial.<br/><br/>A dealer is chosen, who thinks of a word of 4-6 letters, takes the Letter Cards that spell it, and places them face down under the elastics, showing the points and possible letters of each.  The Crypt-O Number for the word -- twice the sum of its letter values -- is set on the dial.  Each other player is dealt a random Clue Card.<br/><br/>In a turn, a player either: asks a general yes/no question, asks a yes/no letter question (&quot;is the 4th letter R?&quot;), guesses the word, or gives the dealer his Clue Card and peeks at the front of the card indicated.  The turn continues until a &quot;no&quot; is received or the Clue Card is used.  Whatever the answer, for each question the scoring wheel is decreased: for a general question, 1; for a letter question, the letter's value; for a wrong word guess, 2.<br/><br/>If a letter is guessed it is turned face-up; if the word is guessed or the last card expose, the round ends.  To score, if the word wasn't guessed, the dealer scores its Crypt-O value, other wise the guesser gets the value on the scoring wheel and the dealer gets the Crypt-O value minus that amount; and each player gets 5 points for each Clue Card they hold.  If the word is unknown to half or more of the players, the round doesn't count.<br/><br/>Rotate the dealer with each round; the game is won by the player who first hits 150 points.<br/><br/>"}, "41933": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1114682.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Robert K.

Perhaps inevitably, tensions rose between them. Each entered the imperialist race very late and had to content itself with the leftovers which the British and French had passed by. When the United States seized Spain&rsquo;s colonial empire in 1898, German jealousy raged hotly. Some German business leaders lusted for the Philippines and Puerto Rico, urging the Kaiser to purchase them from the Spanish before the war ended, or from the Americans afterwards.<br/><br/>German and American squadrons did not, as legend has it, almost come to blows in Manila Bay during the Spanish-American War &mdash; the British spread that story, eager to cultivate American public opinion. But the German and American admirals on the scene did cultivate an intense dislike for one another, and the feelings spread to the top on both sides.<br/><br/>Black Waters is a 64-page book supplement for the Great War at Sea series based on American plans to fight Germany. Most of the scenarios take place in the Caribbean Sea, but some actions are also placed in European waters.<br/><br/>There are 210 die-cut and mounted playing pieces, the same pieces that originally appeared in our now out-of-print U.S. Navy Plan Black.  The Americans get ships ranging from three examples of the South Dakota class through the first American dreadnoughts, the South Carolina class, and the last of the American pre-dreadnoughts, the Connecticut class. There are also a pair of light carriers based on American plans to convert big armored cruisers.<br/><br/>The Germans add three of the GK4531 battle cruiser design and three representatives of the GK4251 battleship. And of course Germany receives an aircraft carrier, the proposed conversion of the huge liner Imperator. Argentina and Brazil receive part of their fleets, and there are two hypothetical Mexican battleships and small contingents from the Netherlands, Venezuela and Colombia.<br/><br/>There are over two dozen new scenarios, including the &quot;War Plan Silver&quot; subset based on Woodrow Wilson's very serious threat to go to war with Italy in May 1919, plus revised versions of most of those originally seen in Plan Black.<br/><br/>This is not a stand-alone game; ownership of U.S. Navy Plan Gold is required to play most of the scenarios and Mediterranean, Jutland and U.S. Navy Plan Red to play all of them.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "average": "7.44167", "name": "Great War at Sea: Black Waters", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": ["130412", "75509"], "usersrated": "12", "boardgameaccessory": ["Great War at Sea: Destroyers"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Great War at Sea"]}, "41990": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Woudlopertje", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic464346_t.jpg", "average": "2.83333", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ado"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic464346.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Excitement and fun in the jungle for very young and old.<br/><br/>Who finds a path through the jungle first?

Players take turns either committing a vote (a disc) to one of the seven colleges, or permanently shifting the border between two colleges by one seat.  Once everyone has passed, dropping out of the game, the player with plurality in each college wins all the valid votes therein.  Tied players in a college cancel each other, so in a three-player game, a 50-50 split would give the college to the third player, even if she had no votes there.  Additionally, each player has a secret color to which they can play invalid votes, which will be removed before tabulation of the college.  This also means that those votes are not awarded to the winner of that college.  Finally, each player has a secret &quot;fetish stone&quot; in the inner ring.  If you win the college containing your fetish stone, you win two bonus votes.  The player with the plurality in final votes wins - respecting the same unforgiving rule for ties as is used for the colleges!<br/><br/>The High Druid is an official game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["Titanic First Publication"], "name": "The High Druid", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence"], "average": "5.99975", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: England", "Stonehenge Games"]}, "41998": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic180581.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Richard Garfield"], "statistics": [], "boardgamecompilation": ["Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game"], "yearpublished": "2007", "maxplayers": "5", "age": "0", "boardgamepublisher": ["Titanic Games"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic180581_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing"], "description": "Magic of Stonehenge is a bluffing game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game.

Winning the trick means placing an apprentice (disc) on (or just below, if occupied) the space on the outer ring matching its card.  Failing to win (without conceding) means taking the card you played as a penalty, which drags one of your apprentices back down toward 1, and ultimately off the board.<br/><br/>Once you have all of your apprentices on the board, you raise a trilithon and remove all your apprentices.
