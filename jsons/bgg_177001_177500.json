On the last day of your mission, your shuttle was destroyed. This left you stranded on a planet that is about to be transformed, killing you but terraformimg humanity's new home. At that moment, you realized the planet was already inhabited by a shape-shifting alien race, and it's natives won't give up without a fight.<br/><br/>The game is broken up into two phases, a morning and an evening. In the morning, players take actions to repair equipment and maintain the group's health and sanity. In the evening, players discuss a course of action. Those two phases make up a day, and players only have a few days to root out the aliens that have infiltrated the group.<br/><br/>The game ends when the shuttle is repaired and players vote to leave. If all people on board are human, humans win. But, if humans failed to test enough players, and even one hidden alien is on board... Aliens win.<br/><br/>And to make the game even more panic ridden, each in game location is in a different real world location. That means that every morning, things are happening in secret; and you have to judge for yourself if the other players are lying or telling the truth. Two humans may go to a location, but if one is a hidden alien, two aliens might come back. Without developing tests and merciless interrogation, you will never know.<br/><br/>Only trust what you've seen with your own eyes, because even the most helpful human might be an alien vying for a seat on the shuttle.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "5", "boardgameversion": {"272622": "First edition"}, "age": "13", "name": "Planet Hysteria", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "average": "6.11", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "177004": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Guns n Zombies", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"272623": "Windows/Macintosh Downloadable edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2659": "Zombies"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2339": "Action RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4729": "Macintosh"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Guns'n'zombies feature takes place in the post apocalyptic world.

Each Pilot and Robot has its own deck of Attack and Instant cards. Choose 15 of them to build your hand.

You never draw cards from a deck, so the combos and combat cycles you design are always at your fingertips.

It&rsquo;s simple enough to learn in 3 minutes, yet deep enough where you are discovering new strategies every time you play it. But best of all, it&rsquo;s always your turn.<br/><br/>Players start with a hand of 6 bids. Bids are valued 1 - 5 with the lower valued cards containing some game changing actions. Players chose a bid and place it face down in the ready position. When everyone is ready the bids are simultaneously revealed. The bids&rsquo; colors signify what you are bidding on. Red bids recruit gangsters with unique abilities, green bids buy various types of Contraband (worth victory points), and blue bids bribe the Cop, which protects your points and forces the competition to lose theirs. After 3 rounds the highest bidder for a given color wins the corresponding prize. Players take their winnings and reset the board for the next hand.<br/><br/>Player interaction comes from the actions on the lower numbered bid cards. Actions allow you to steal your rivals contraband, assassinate their mercenaries, and put the odds in your favor.<br/><br/>Each gangster has their own unique ability that is active throughout the entire game. Depending on which gangsters you recruit, different strategies will become available. For example, the Mob Boss gives you an additional Victory Point for each Gangster on your team, this card pairs well with the Recruiter who gives you a permanent +2 to your red bid total.

Each player is also given a random Loyalty card, which is kept secret from the other players. Most players will be Crew and will work together to complete repairs, represented by Goal cards. Crew members win the game when they have completed more goals than there are players, all Crew have at least one completed Goal, and any Crew member correctly declares victory on their turn.<br/><br/>One or two players will be Outsiders. Outsiders win the game if they declare victory on their turn and all Crew members are Doomed.

An addendum provides alternate rules for groups that find this too harsh or would prefer a more narrative ending.<br/><br/>The setting is gritty sci-fi with art by James Zark lending a cyberpunk flavor to the characters. The basic concept deals with a future where vessels move between universes to save time on space travel, with the occasional side-effect of crew members becoming murderous and paranoid, called &quot;Outsiders&quot;.<br/><br/>Outsiders are literally castaways from other dimensions. Having shifted between universes too many times, they suddenly find that they no longer recognized things that should be familiar. Torn from a discarded reality, their only option is to seize control of the ship and reverse the shifts in reality, dooming the rest of the crew in the process.<br/><br/>The game lends itself to a wide variety of strategies, and despite a small learning curve the basics come into focus pretty quickly.

If you encounter him, he may help you stave off the end of the world and let you peer into the future &mdash; or you may be attacked by demon horsemen and stalked by cursed followers.<br/><br/>Time is running out. When the Harbinger entered the realm he brought with him a prophecy of impending doom and a series of seven Omens to watch for: when the seventh appears, the end is upon you. Talisman (fourth edition): The Harbinger Expansion features four unique decks of Omen cards, each making manifest a different downfall. In one Omen deck the constellations align, threatening the extinction of magic. In another, the dead rise from their graves and battle to overthrow the living. In another, the time of judgement arrives bringing with it war, famine, death, plagues, and other forms of destruction.<br/><br/>In the fourth, the world shatters into many pieces and the terrain transforms unpredictably. New Terrain cards enter the game and alter the landscape, supplanting fields with barrens, deserts with floodlands, and cities with bogs. As doom draws nearer, more and more of the realm is transformed until the seventh Omen appears and all of Talisman becomes a deadly devastation.<br/><br/>In game terms, when the Harbinger is in your region, you must draw from the peril-filled Harbinger deck instead of that region's normal Adventure deck whenever you are instructed to draw cards. When you draw an Event, the Harbinger moves into your space, but has no ill effects upon you. However, you move into the space occupied by the Harbinger, you must roll a single die. The result could grant you a second turn, or let you look at the top three cards of any deck you choose. It might force you to populate your space with vicious enemies, treacherous followers, and unpredictable events. Worst of all, your result might cause the current Omen to be discarded, activating the next Omen and hastening the advent of the end times.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "0", "boardgameversion": {"272924": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.63436", "name": "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition): The Harbinger Expansion", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "195", "expands": {"27627": {"name": "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition)"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"26": "Talisman"}}, "177212": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1501": {"name": "Jeffrey Neil Bellinger"}}, "statistics": {}, "name": "TRAP!", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "17", "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2507892_t.jpg", "average": "3.79412", "boardgamepublisher": {"26024": {"name": "IDW Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2507892.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"272926": "English first edition (ninja)"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "poll": {}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "TRAP! is a fast-paced, deductive, dice-rolling, card game system for 2-4 players in which you're trying to ensnare the biggest sets of creatures over the course of five rounds.<br/><br/>Each TRAP! game is a standalone item, but they are compatible with one another and parts can be combined to create a personalized TRAP!<br/><br/>"}, "177213": {"rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Mines #1", "rpgproducer": {"37664": "Mark A.

Their foes come from the nine kingdoms of man across three separate continents- each with their own motivations and machinations. Ashara is a world of incredibly high mountain ranges that divide the continents, meaning that wars must be fought either from the air or by sea.<br/><br/>Ashara, being the known lands of the kingdoms of mankind is at war.  The year is 1448, being the 120th occurrence of the year of the Falcon in the Zodiac of Shen. Nations battle for conquest, glory, and power. Dragon riders, highly trained warriors and the pride of their nations, sit atop powerful dragons to do battle with one another and defend against threats from the skies, lands and seas of Ashara. Dragons fight with tooth, claws and their mighty breath weapons of fire, ice, lightning, poison, acid, wind or the mysterious life stealing power of the rend. Choose your dragon and the nation you defend as you take to the skies from the back of a young and agile drake or an ancient and powerful wyrm. Or, choose to register as one of the many mercenary wings, small bands of dragon riders fighting for the highest bidder or for your own personal crusade. The time has come for heroes and their mighty steeds to take to the skies. This is the age of the Riders of Ashara.<br/><br/>"}, "177225": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2508660.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"82098": {"name": "\u6797 \u5efa\u592a (Kenta Hayashi)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"82098": "\u6797 \u5efa\u592a (Kenta Hayashi)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"29708": {"name": "\u30a4\u30eb\u30ac\u30f3\u30b0 (Illgang)"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2508660_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "40", "boardgamecategory": {"1031": {"name": "Racing"}}, "description": "Publisher's summary:<br/>\u6191\u8005 (Tsukimono) is a Japanese boardgame from the doujin circle Illgang.<br/><br/>Get 3 YO-RIKI by attaching YO-KAI to the other players, and reach the mysterious mountain first.<br/><br/>\u96c6\u3081\u305f\u5996\u602a\u3092\u4ed6\u306e\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306b\u3068\u308a\u6191\u304b\u305b\u3001\u5148\u306b\u5996\u529b\uff13\u3064\u3092\u624b\u306b\u3057\u3066\u5996\u5c71\u306b\u305f\u3069\u308a\u3064\u304f\u3053\u3068\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059\u3001\u5371\u967a\u306a\u904a\u622f\u3067\u3059\u3002<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"272942": "Japanese first edition"}, "age": "8", "name": "Tsukimono", "playingtime": "40", "boardgamemechanic": {"2007": "Pick-up and Deliver"}, "average": "7.23333", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}}, "177226": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Mythic Desert and Ocean Giants", "rpgproducer": {"36376": "Rosa Gibbons"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2510180.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"272949": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"24357": "Mythic Mastery"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2510180_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Masters of Dune and Wave!<br/><br/>It is said that the desert and the ocean have much in common, with the rolling dunes of sand often being compared to the rolling waves of the sea.

They hand out quests, provide roleplaying, help the PCs and hinder them at the most infuriating moments.<br/><br/>But how can you come up with fresh new NPCs all the time?<br/><br/>It's hard making them interesting so your players don't call you out on boring gameplay.<br/><br/>And it's tough coming up with inspiration to populate your villages, cities and dungeons with great NPCs. Those places need dozens of non-player characters from shop-keepers to guards to flunkies.<br/><br/>Plus, it always takes time. I don't know about you, but I love NPCs and I just never have enough time to make all the ones I need because I have adventures to work on, maps to make, items to create....<br/><br/>And here's the worst part. When I do spend the time and energy to create a full NPC, the players just haul up and kill him! Or even worse, they ignore him completely. Why is getting ignored worse than getting killed? Hey, at least I got to play the dead NPC for a round. :)<br/><br/>Regardless, I learned a long time ago not to waste time detailing NPCs until they've proven worthy by surviving contact with the players.<br/><br/>Roleplaying Tips Presents....<br/><br/>So today I present you the perfect solution: 3 Line NPCs.<br/><br/>These suckers are not only fast to build &ndash; testers reported making a complete 3 Line NPC in 15 seconds, some in 10! &ndash; but they give you the essential ingredients you need to pull off awesome NPC encounters.<br/><br/>Even though these NPCs are just 3 lines long, they pack a huge roleplaying and story punch because of how they're constructed. One tester wrote:<br/><br/>&quot;The template was much easier to work with than I expected. It was great and useful, and it helped me return the focus to my stories, So yeah, I really liked it.&quot;<br/><br/>You see, we get stuck on the mechanics of GMing and forget one of the most important things about GMing: the story. We spend a long time detailing NPCs who may or may not survive minutes in the game, and we get a kind of tunnel vision. We lose our way fiddling with the game bits instead of making sure our game bits all help tell epic stories.<br/><br/>3 Line NPCs ensures you stay focused on what's most important to your game.<br/><br/>This book has three sections.<br/><br/>450 NPCs Ready to Go<br/><br/>One section gives you 450 instant 3 Line NPCs you can drop into your game right now. Use these for inspiration when creating your own NPCs, or just drop them into the game next time you need someone interesting for the &quot;suspicious looking guy&quot; you just made up on the spot.<br/><br/>Tutorials on How to Roll Your Own<br/><br/>Another section shows you step by step how to create your own 3 Line NPCs. It reveals the secret sauce that goes into each line that makes this method so simple yet so powerful for GMing great NPCs.<br/><br/>Several dozen Roleplaying Tips Readers tested out the formula and wrote back with tips and suggestions. I've added these into the book as well, to help you get even more mileage out of this flexible formula.<br/><br/>Killer NPC Generation Tables<br/><br/>Some readers let me know that thinking up secrets, motives, professions and other aspects of the NPCs was tough. They said once they had the seed generated, the rest flowed easily.<br/><br/>So I've added 7 killer charts to help inspire your NPC generation:<br/><br/>    d100 NPC Secrets<br/>    d135 NPC Side Plots<br/>    d50 NPC Goals, Motives &amp; Dreams<br/>    d1,000 NPC Traits<br/>    d40 Slightly More Verbose Traits<br/>    d50 NPC Fears<br/>    d65 Occupations<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>These will give you instant help when stuck making any kind of NPC.<br/><br/>Playtested &amp; Proven Awesome<br/><br/>In the making of this book, 109 game masters tested out the 3 Line NPC method. All of them said they loved the formula and found it easy to use. This technique has now been thoroughly tested. And it's been proven to work for everyone who tried it. This method will definitely work for you.<br/><br/>Any Game, And Genre<br/><br/>The 450 NPCs in this book are fantasy. The 3 Line NPC method itself, however, is universal. Use it for any game system and any genre.<br/><br/>If you need 450 instant NPCs to drop into a sci-fi game, then this book isn't for you. You'd need to switch out the fantasy elements for sci-fi, such as &quot;stormtrooper&quot; to replace &quot;guard&quot;. So, not so instant. But the inspiration tables and the tutorials are still valid, system neutral, and 100% cross-genre compatible. Because love, hate, jealousy, murder and surprises are universal.<br/><br/>"}, "177390": {"rpgitemversion": {"273198": "PDF version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Accursed Game Master Screen Inserts", "rpgproducer": {"21121": "John Dunn"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2512924.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"25110": "Accursed"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpg": {"286": "Savage Worlds"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2512924_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>This 4-panel Gamemaster screen (front and back) incorporates game rules and artwork from the Accursed RPG setting for Savage Worlds.

Each tries to maintain a delicate balance of resources, military power, and technological achievements as they explore the galaxy.  Game play is fast and fun with varied decisions to be made by each player during their missions.<br/><br/>In each game of Galaxy Command there are near and far systems that must be overcome in order to bring in new resources and wealth.  Near systems must be explored before attempting to reach far systems.  Some far systems require key technology to be reached with any chance of success. Near systems provide resources that can build your military strength and develop technologies allowing you to overcome challenges as you go deeper into space.<br/><br/>During a turn players reveal a system card (starting with near systems) on their mission path and try to overcome its obstacles.  Next they collect wealth and resources and build military strength and technology.  And finally a random event card is drawn that may affect one or all players in the game.  The event cards are also the timer on the game.  When the event cards run out the game is over.  The Galaxy Command (all players) saves or fails in its mission by reaching enough far systems to sustain its empire.  Each Galaxy Commander (individual player), provided the empire is saved, can be the best among peers by his contribution (score) to the overall mission success.<br/><br/>No two games will play the same as the systems you get, and the decisions you make will change game to game.The event cards affect different players during each game.The game plays in 15 to 45 minutes depending on the number of players and how quick they play.The game is playable for ages 8 to 800 (if you're from planet Cirius...).<br/><br/>Originally published by Robert as a print and play solitaire game with 19 cards.
