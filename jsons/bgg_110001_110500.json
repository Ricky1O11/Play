His kingdoms included not only Spain but both parts of the Low Countries, Italy and colonies in the Philipines and the Americas. Now two dynasties claimed the Spanish throne, the French Bourbons and the Austrian Habsburgs. Charles last will proclaimed that Philip, Duke of Anjou (grandson of Louis XIV) was to be offered the whole Spanish empire. However, the German emperor, Leopold I had launched his son the Archduke Charles as pretender to the throne. England preferred the Electoral Prince Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria who was Leopold&rsquo;s grandson. In February 1701 the 17 year old Philip was crowned in Madrid and was reluctantly recognized by England. In the same time French troops secured the Spanish Nederlands and cut of England and the United Provinces from Spanish trade. This resulted in the Treaty of Den Haag 1701 which formed the great alliance between Austria, England and the United Provinces and was later supported by Prussia, Hanover, Denmark, the Holy Roman Empire, Portugal and Savoy. The treaty did actually recognized Philip as the king of Spain but more important, it retained the Spanish trade, gave the Spanish territories in Italy as well as the Spanish Nederlands to Austria and formed a defensive alliance against France. On the other side Bavaria and Cologne supported the French in this upcoming conflict. When Portugal joined the great alliance the focus turned to put Archduke Charles on the Spanish throne.<br/><br/>The war now started slowly in Italy where an Austrian force commanded by Eugene of Savoy invaded the Duchy of Milan, one of the Spanish territories in Italy, which prompted a French intervention. Things are now set up for A Throne Vacant&trade; to begin.<br/><br/>The game:<br/><br/>A Throne Vacant&trade;( # 107-1 ) is easy to learn and is played in a fast phased manner. The units are blocks in regimental and army size for greatest flexibility in taking steps and differentiating the quality and strength of the troops, like in its sister game Pax Baltica. The high quality map is divided in territories which you have to conquer order to control it. This is made by taking each and every town in a territory. Navies will also play an important part in ATV in the sense that you have to keep the sea lines open to the colonies, and of course transport British troops to the continent. As this intriguing conflict covers the whole of western Europe the map covers a large area from the Atlantic coast in the west to Prague in the east, from northern England in the north to Oran in the south. Playable nations are England/Great Britain, France, Spain, Austria and The United Provinces. Other countries represented in the game are Portugal, Savoy, Bavaria, Denmark and The Holy Roman Empire.<br/><br/>So, why don&rsquo;t you enter the roles of some of the great military commanders of history, Marlborough, Prince Eugene, Villars or Vend&ocirc;me. Lead them to great victories and secure the Spanish crown for your pretender to the throne. We are quite sure that this game will bring a Machiavellian smile to your face.<br/><br/>The game, packed in a book case includes a 50 x 70cm-size full color map, 80 high quality wooden blocks, 4 dice, various markers and rules, including different scenarios.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"129911": "First edition"}, "age": "14", "name": "A Throne Vacant", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "average": "6.83333", "usersrated": "6", "boardgamefamily": {"6137": "Block wargames"}}, "110053": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Guild Companion (May 2001)", "rpgproducer": {"15394": "Nicholas Caldwell"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1112759.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"13464": "The Guild Companion"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"72548": "Against the Shadow Strategy Guide - Part Three"}, "rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpgissueversion": {"129912": "HTML version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1112759_t.png", "description": "This page does not exist.

It followed the failure of Winter Olympics: Lillehammer 94 and was the last &quot;Olympic&quot; video game released for 16-bit consoles (Sega's Mega Drive/Genesis and Nintendo's SNES and Nintendo's Game Boy.<br/><br/>It follows the already common button mashing techniques of previous (and future) games, with the usual exceptions.<br/><br/>It has 10 events (three more than Olympic Gold), but only two aren't based on track and field events, and unlike Winter Olympics, there are no major differences between each event on different platforms.<br/><br/>Graphics are considered to be either worse or only slightly better overall than those of Olympic Gold. While each nation (for a total of 28) has its own colour set, it was the only redeeming feature. The isometric view on most events meant that most times only grass was visible, and although some backgrounds were animated, on some a few sprites were out of proportion with others; the athlete in the pole vault looks too short when compared to the background objects while in the high jump the opposite occurs (and also looks smaller after the jump). The lack of competitive events outside the &quot;Olympic stadium&quot; also does not help to reduce the poor impression of the graphics, as it makes the game even more repetitive.<br/><br/>100 m sprint<br/>    110 m hurdles<br/>    Pole vault<br/>    High jump<br/>    Long Jump<br/>    Triple Jump<br/>    Javelin<br/>    Discus<br/>    Archery<br/>    Skeet<br/><br/>As in the previous titles, there are three difficulty levels and both Olympics and mini-olympics (here called custom game) modes; however, the points table was removed, and the only way to compare results is by the medals' table. In the sprinting events, there are two qualifying rounds, and only the winner (out of only four competitors) pass to the next round. On long jump, triple jump, discus and javelin each player has three attempts; the best 10 progress to the final and have three extra attempts. The best result overall wins. In high jump and pole vault there aren't qualifying rounds, the players jump in turns until missing three consecutive jumps.<br/>The difficulty levels are terribly uneven. While in the high jump they can break the olympic record in easy and miss the 5.80 m barrier at hard, in skeet at easy, top computer players hit 3, in normal 4 and in hard 5. This also leads at an incredibly long medal-awarding ceremony, with four or five competitors in the bronze or silver medal. It's impossible to break the records on archery and skeet events, as the best possible result in skeet is 25 (5x5, the equivalent of only one perfect day) while the record is set on 200 points, and archery with a possible result of 180 (6 arrows in 3 rounds) and 338 points as the record. The remaining records are perfectly possible to be beaten by expert players. The lack of EEPROM saving (which was already common in 1996) means the records are not logged inside the game, and as soon as the console is unplugged (rather than just reset), the default records return.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Olympic Summer Games (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "110065": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Operation Logic Bomb", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"129997": "Japanese Super Famicom edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1732206.jpg", "videogameseries": {"17069": "Fortified Zone"}, "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4440": "SNES"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1732206_t.jpg", "description": "Operation Logic Bomb, known in Japan as Ikari no Y\u014dsai (\u6012\u308a\u306e\u8981\u585e &quot;The Fortress of Fury&quot;) is a 1993 overhead action video game developed and published by Jaleco for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

Doing so, it was perfectly possible to someone win the gold medal in short track, and get few more points than other skaters (even not finalists) that got better qualifying times. This scoring method also meant that someone who won gold medals in six or seven events might fall outside the top 10 if is disqualified on the remaining three.<br/><br/>There are many differences between the versions released for each system. Although that could be explained by different hardware, as of 1993 it was possible to make a sprite-based video game on a 16 bit console using the PC version as a base.<br/>In this case, differences were due to US Gold's choice to use two companies developing different versions of the game separately and also to the development methodology of Tiertex, who used a different game programmer for each platform - each one programming in a different assembly language (no porting). Amongst major differences, freestyle moguls are different on the 16-bit versions, and overall the Super NES version is much more unforgiving than the Mega Drive/Genesis version, while the Master System version is the one allowing better control on alpine skiing events.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Winter Olympics: Lillehammer 94&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "110067": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Olympic Gold", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogameversion": {"129999": "North American SNES edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2369": "Sports - Track & Field"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4440": "SNES"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Olympic Gold is the official video game of the XXV Olympic Summer Games, hosted by Barcelona, Spain in 1992.

There are three difficulty levels (club, national and Olympic) with noticeable differences from each other: computer controlled athletes are actually capable of breaking world and Olympic records at the higher levels, while achieving only mediocre results on lower levels.<br/><br/>Scoring in the Olympic modes follow the results table by position, the gold medal giving 24 points, and then reducing one point for each competitor behind until the 12th and last receives 13 points. The game is easy for experienced players, except for the sprinting and hurdles events and the hammer, as the computer is able to break records quite easily in Olympic, and they also rely on a fair share or luck and random.<br/><br/>Diving, unlike more recent titles where the player simply has to &quot;click-a-long&quot; a predifined sequence of buttons actually gives the player to control their own jumps. This means that one could indicate a jump and make one completely different, resulting in 0.0 notes. However, with practice it's perfectly possible to reach marks above 9.0 even for jumps rated 3.5. The same happens with pole vault, as an experienced player is able to clear 6.35 m easily.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Olympic Gold: Barcelona '92&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "110068": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Sydney 2000", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogameversion": {"130000": "North American PlayStation edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"14140": "Official Summer Olympic"}, "videogametheme": {"2369": "Sports - Track & Field"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4433": "PlayStation"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Sydney 2000 is the official video game of the XXVII Olympic Summer Games, hosted by Sydney, Australia in 2000. Developed by ATD and published by Eidos, it was released for the PC (Windows), PlayStation and the Dreamcast. With a total of 32 countries and 12 events, it was the follow-up of Olympic Summer Games: Atlanta '96.  With good sales and mostly positive reviews, it won the BAFTA award for the Sports game of the year.<br/><br/>100 m sprint<br/>    110 m hurdles<br/>    Javelin (F)<br/>    Hammer<br/>    Triple Jump<br/>    High Jump (F)<br/>    Skeet shooting<br/>    Super Heavyweight Weight Lifting<br/>    100 m Freestyle Swimming (F)<br/>    10 m Platform Diving (F)<br/>    Chase Cycling<br/>    Kayak K1 Slalom<br/><br/>Although the button mashing-laden gameplay had not changed from previous games, the main competition itself become more complex with the inclusion of the Virtual Gym and a complete Olympics qualifying tour, composed by four stages, and the player can only run for the medals of the events he qualified for. While some of the events are the women's, each event is only set to one gender: it isn't possible to run the women's 100 m hurdles or the men's high jump.<br/><br/>Individually, there isn't much difference in gameplay from previous games: two action buttons control speed and there's a third for extra action: jumping, passing a hurdle, setting the angle and releasing the hammer or javelin, tough the wall, etc. All events rely on this formula, except diving (which uses &quot;click-a-long&quot; rather than the freeform jumping of Olympic Gold), Skeet and K1 Slalom. Chase Cycling also requires the player to pace himself, or the final cyclist will run out of long pace before the final sprint.<br/><br/>The biggest difference from previous games in the series lies in the Olympic mode: instead of starting in the Olympics, the player must improve and qualify an athlete for the event. Each event has four stages (Open Trials, Initiation Event, The Championship, Olympic Class), and for each stage the player must complete some minigames in the Cyber Gym that range from running on a treadmill, climbing a pole, squats or reaction training, for a total of 20 minigames. Completing a Cyber Gym game improves the athlete in one of the three ratings temporarily, and to earn the new capacities definitively, the athlete must complete an event with a certain score. After the player is happy with the athlete development, he can try to qualify for the next stage by running against other athletes at the same level. Although it's possible to compete in the Olympics as soon as the athlete reaches the Olympic Class, to get a perfect athlete (with 100% on all ratings) one must complete all minigames, including those on Olympic Class. As the game relies mostly on athletes' ratings, even players with lower button presses per minute can make World Record times without serious effort as long as they passed all the mini games. Other modes include a arcade mode, training and head to head, where two players can compete with their Olympic mode trained athletes. There are four difficulty levels altogether.<br/><br/>Although generally stable, the game lacks tweaking in some events: the High jump uses men's results, and while some events such as the 100 m sprint and triple jump are quite easy, others such as the javelin and hammer throw require lots of training.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Sydney 2000 (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "110069": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Torino 2006", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogameversion": {"275879": "Dutch Windows edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2546050.jpg", "videogameseries": {"14141": "Official Winter Olympics"}, "videogametheme": {"2371": "Sports - Skiing"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2546050_t.jpg", "description": "Torino 2006 is a video game about the 2006 Winter Olympics from Turin, Italy.

It was published in issue #9 (February 2002) of Ravage, a French miniature wargaming magazine.<br/><br/>Each mini has several stats describing its ability to move, shoot, fight and use &quot;Chi&quot; powers. The most important is Action Points (AP) which represent the character's life energy.<br/>A player's turn begins by choosing one of several tactics. Tactics influence how many figures can be activated, how many APs are recovered at the end of the turn and what figures can recover APs. The player then chooses which figures to activate, and expends the figure's APs to move, charge, use a ranged weapon or a Chi power. Each fight is duel; duel are resolved by secretly choosing a combat action for each combatant (which can give bonuses or penalties to die rolls), then rolling for initiative, then trying to beat the opponent's Armour score with 1d6 + the fighter attack score. Each damage point lowers the victim's APs, minis with no APs left must make a save roll each time they are wounded to avoid death.<br/><br/>The last player standing wins the game, also players are encouraged to create scenarios and alternate victory conditions.<br/><br/>The rules include two army lists with classic Japanese folklore figures (samurais, ninjas, shaolin monks, kappas, onis...), a set of markers and tactical advice for both featured armies (Light and Darkness).<br/><br/>Scale: skirmish (1 mini = 1 combatant, 1 cm = 1 m, a turn = a few seconds)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"130119": "Ravage magazine edition"}, "age": "10", "name": "Ha-Shin!", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"10634": "Country: Japan"}}, "110131": {"rpg": {"1235": "Books about Roleplaying Games"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Collected Adventures of Phil and Dixie", "rpgproducer": {"52792": "Greg Ketter"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1114222.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "rpgitemversion": {"130120": "First Printing, October 1991"}, "average": "9.5", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"185": "Comedy / Satire"}, "rpgcategory": {"2139": "Non-Game Book (but RPG Related)"}, "rpgseries": {"10417": "What's New With Phil and Dixie"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1114222_t.jpg", "description": "Chaotically Neutral Humor!<br/><br/>from the back cover<br/>Collected here for the first time from the pages of Dragon magazine, Phil and Dixie are your guides on a hilariously surreal look at the popular world of Role Playing Games.<br/><br/>Whether you're already an accomplished G.M. or a first level beginner, this early work from the demented mind of award winning cartoonist and author Phil Foglio will have you laughing out loud, no matter who's reading over your shoulder.<br/><br/>"}, "110132": {"rpg": {"1235": "Books about Roleplaying Games"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Phil Foglio's What's New 2", "rpgproducer": {"30910": "Robert Garcia"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1114243.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"130121": "First Printing, October 1991"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"185": "Comedy / Satire"}, "rpgcategory": {"2139": "Non-Game Book (but RPG Related)"}, "rpgseries": {"10417": "What's New With Phil and Dixie"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1114243_t.jpg", "description": "from the back cover<br/>Dragons and Dungeons and Weyrs, Oh My!<br/><br/>Phil and Dixie take us on a light-headed look at role-playing games, one of the world's most fanatically pursued pasttimes.

Lucidia is a living, high fantasy world manifested though a series of epic works. These epic works include a series of novels, graphic novels, short stories, board games and a role-playing game. The first of his works, Islandis: A World of Lucidia Boardgame, will be released in 2012 via Time Warp Games.<br/> Theme:<br/><br/>Entitled Islandis: A World of Lucidia Boardgame, this prologue will transport players to the humble beginnings of Lucidia, to a place far removed from the mainland, to a time before time, to the very birth place of life. <br/>Islandis is the largest and most populated island in the Tokelau Sea, serving as the cornerstone for the exploration and settlement of the Asazi Isles. The island is teaming with culture, beauty, bountiful sea life, a seemingly endless supply of resources, and all of the essentials for a growing populous.<br/>In time, through innovation and exploration, neighboring islands are discovered and populated. The new found islands introduce the Asazi people to previously undiscovered resources, thus giving life to a perpetual network of trade routes, and an incessant market place.<br/>Island life is sublime, until...<br/>Villages wake to the sound of chaos. The island pulses and cries with anguish. Families stumble out of their bungalows and into the night, only to find themselves dodging debris from the sky. Turning toward the summit, screams echo across the sea as bursts of lava erupt into the night sky. Dark clouds loom overhead, and no stars are watching from the night sky. Almost word for word, prophesy unfolds. This way of life is coming to an end,it is time for a new beginning.<br/>In Islandis, each player takes on the role of a great leader of the Asazi people. It is each player&rsquo;s charge to lead their tribe in this prophetic time.<br/>Each player has a whole host of strategic colors in his pallet. Some may decide to stay on the island and continue to gather resources, make trade, and nourish culture. Others may gather resources to build vessels, explore and settle undiscovered islands.  The most successful leaders will exhaust both of these options in perfect harmony. Whether choosing to make significant contributions in trade, develop high culture, or spread the seeds of their people across the vastness of the great sea, one common goal remains: To not be forgotten, to make your mark on the history of the World of Lucidia.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/><br/>At its core, Islandis is a 1-4 player, turn based worker placement game for ages 13+; however, due to the nature of epic works, players will find that Islandis is truly a set of mini games within the whole part. In accord with the worker placement mechanic, players will enjoy fending off sea creatures, making trade, exploration, variable player powers, dice rolling, set building, and empire building (including conversion sites, villages, monoliths, colossi, and temples).<br/>There are five primary building resources found on Islandis (Stone, Iron Ore, Gold Ore, Cotton, and Timber). These five resources, in many cases, will need to be converted into their more useful forms (Ashlar, Iron, Gold, Textiles, and Lumber). In order to upgrade resources, you will need to utilize your conversions sites, and workers. Dice serve as workers in the game and the results of a roll indicate the productivity of workers. Throughout the game players will find ways to &quot;inspire&quot; their workers to be more productive with the assistance of innovative tribesmen and women!<br/>In addition to the five primary resources, and their upgraded incarnations, players will find many uses for the four major imported goods (Copal, Bamboo, Dyes, and Fruit). These imported goods are earned by lending workers to the four neighboring islands as trade.<br/>Finally, and most important, players will need to feed their people! Players will rush for the opportunity to fish from the shore, however, due to limited space, most will be required to employ their sea vessels to earn fish. The most successful players will begin planting fruit trees early in the game to supplement the demands of fishing. <br/>During the game, players will be able to develop culturally, allowing for a variety of new uses for the 14 resources. These cultural advancements include heirloom recipes, jewelry, musical instruments, and more, each lending their tribes the ability to earn victory points through trading cultural goods.<br/><br/>Goal:<br/><br/>The goal of each player is to earn as many victory points as possible before Islandis is destroyed by molten lava. Victory points are earned in a variety of fashions: Trading resources at the markets, developing cultural items and trading at the markets, fighting off sea creatures, surviving deadly storms, building villages, monoliths, colossi, and temples on newly discovered islands.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"130180": "English first edition"}, "age": "13", "name": "Islandis: A World of Lucidia Boardgame", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2004": "Set Collection"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "110149": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Tinderbox", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"130182": "English/European ZX Spectrum edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2335": "Fairy Tale"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamecharacter": {"14274": "Tom (Tinderbox)"}, "videogamegenre": {"2168": "Text Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4950": "ZX Spectrum"}, "poll": {}, "vgcharacterversion": {"130557": "Tom"}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Tinderbox is a text adventure based on the fairy tale of the same name.

It is the third game in the Rushing Beat series, following Rival Turf! and Brawl Brothers, although the three games were localized as unrelated titles in North America. Presented in a &frac34; perspective, the game is a beat 'em up which was released for the Super Nintendo.  The manual of the North American release details the localized story. The game takes place in the year 2015, after the &quot;economic wars&quot; of 2011. The Deutchland Moldavia (DM) corporation rules most of the world and its resources, conducting mysterious genetic experiments. Four people affected by DM's research- Flynn, Echo, Al and Prokop -seek revenge on the corporation for its wrongdoings.<br/><br/>There are six selectable characters in the game; up to four players can play the main game mode simutaneously if the Super Multitap is connected. The game is a standard beat'em up game in which players face a slew of enemies, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The controls are the standard punch, special attack, taunt, jump and block. There are also super moves. The Peace Keepers has multiple endings with multiple branching paths, each path with its own boss fights and cut scenes. A versus mode is also available, in which two to four players can face each other.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The Peace Keepers&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "110165": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Guild Companion (Feb 2003)", "rpgproducer": {"15394": "Nicholas Caldwell"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1114504.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"13464": "The Guild Companion"}, "rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpgissueversion": {"130213": "HTML version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1114504_t.png", "description": "<br/>Contents:<br/><br/><br/>     Words from the Wise (Guys) - Nicholas HM Caldwell<br/><br/><br/>The Editor talks about his latest project - Construct Companion<br/><br/>     Alternate Coinage/Commerce System - Aaron Smalley<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>A supplemental article for the City of Archendurn module, including an extensive price list<br/><br/>     Playing MECCG - Hazard Play - Nigel Buckle<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The first in a seven-part series on how to improve your MECCG games through better play<br/><br/>     Rethinking Umbar - Chris Seeman<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Using evidence from the History of Middle-Earth, a new picture of Umbar in the Third Age is revealed<br/><br/>     Law and Order - Eric Brad<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Our irregular series for less-experienced GMs and players looks at crime in fantasy worlds<br/><br/>     Revised RMSR Stats and Categories - Denis Garnier<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>An Integrated System of Stats/Categories with new stats for Rolemaster<br/><br/>     Rolemaster Professions in the Forgotten Realms - Chris Adams<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>How to use RMSS/FRP Professions in the Forgotten Realms<br/><br/>     The Guild Companion: Crash and Burn - Two Sample Crews - Greg Schneider<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Ready to Run PCs from two privateer ships for Spacemaster.

Released first in Japan, it later appeared in Europe. Rainbow Bell Adventures is a side-scrolling platform game, the first departure in a series of mostly vertically scrolling shooter games.<br/><br/>Rainbow Bell Adventures is a typical side-scrolling platformer, in which either Twinbee, Winbee or Gwinbee must get to the end of a stage. All characters use their punch to attack, which can be charged to unleash a punch wave. They have two sets of weapons, one of them is either a short or long-ranged weapon (a hammer for Twinbee, a lasso for Winbee, and throwing rattles for Gwinbee), and the other one is a gun, which is a reference to Detana!! Twinbee's cutscene, in which Twinbee is shown with two guns on each hand. All three can temporally fly in eight directions by propelling via a rocket pack that must be charged, as well as hover.<br/><br/>Aside from their weapons, the major difference between the characters is the time they require to fully charge their punch wave or their rocket propeller: Twinbee has an average charging time; Winbee charges her rocket propeller the fastest, but takes the most to charge a punch wave; Gwinbee, on the other hand, fills charges his punch quickly, but takes a while to charge his propeller.<br/><br/>The bell power-up from the rest of the series also appears here, and it allows any of the characters to obtain various kinds of power-ups, depending of the color of the bell, such as the sets of weapons, the gun, speed, options and invincibility. Unlike other Twinbee games, the bells are obtained by defeating enemies instead of shooting clouds.<br/><br/>The game also features a versus mode, in which players must defeat their opponents for three rounds.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;TwinBee: Rainbow Bell Adventure&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "110177": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Guild Companion (Sep 2003)", "rpgproducer": {"15394": "Nicholas Caldwell"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1114497.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"13464": "The Guild Companion"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"71100": "Adventure Design Fumbles: Items"}, "rpg": {"1788": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"130231": "HTML version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1114497_t.png", "description": "This page does not exist.

Though relatively unknown, these conflicts, raging from 1739-1748, comprised the first &quot;world war&quot;. The primary naval actions took place in three theatres: the English Channel and Bay of Biscay, the Caribbean, and the western Mediterranean. Forces also clashed in India, along America's eastern seaboard, and in the Pacific. Each of the other games covers one of these theatres. Mistral covers the western Mediterranean, where Spain tried to keep her lines of communication open to her army in Italy, and France's Toulon Fleet continually harassed the British.<br/><br/>Mistral is a two player strategy game. You command either the British or Bourbon (French and Spanish) fleets. Orders are handed down to you from your Admiralty, and you must try to fulfill them within the framework of the wider war, which is represented by a set of events. Your opponent will have orders of his own to fulfill, but with his spare forces he will be attempting to foil your plans. Success will earn you Prestige (victory points), and may even have an impact on the land campaign. You must decide when and where to commit resources, where to feint and where to strike, organising your &quot;sail&quot; (ships) into squadrons, and your squadrons into flotillas commanded by leaders (commodores and admirals). Maintaining sufficient forces at &quot;battle readiness&quot; is critical, but very difficult, since ships constantly suffer wear and tear &ndash; a battle may be won and the campaign lost. Scenarios are one year (16 turns) long, playable in 3-4 hours (the number of counters in play is quite small). The campaign game consists of a number of years pre-chosen by the players.

The game was released in 1989.<br/><br/>It was ported by U.S. Gold for DOS, Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. The game was later renamed to Sega Soccer on the Mega 6 compilation cartridge on the Mega Drive removing the Virgin Mastertronic credits.<br/><br/>The game presents a top-down view of a simple version of soccer (there are no fouls, substitutions, or strategies). Players must dribble and pass the ball towards one end of the field and try to score a goal by forcing the ball into the opposing team's net. When the player's team has the ball, he or she can either dribble the ball across the field, kick the ball towards the goal, pass the ball in the air to another team member, or kick the ball forward in the direction that the player is currently facing. When the opposing team has the ball, the player can switch between different team members on the field, or slide kick their opponent to dislodge the ball from their control.<br/><br/>When the ball goes out of bounds, the game will switch to a full-screen graphical view for a corner kick or a goal kick. If the game ends in a tie and is not an elimination round match during the championship mode, the game will switch to a graphical penalty kick view.<br/><br/>To start a game, the player must first select which country they would like to be. Teams are rated on a scale from 1 to 5 (5 being the best) based on four different attributes (Speed, Skill, Defense, and Keeper). The best team in the game is Brazil, while the worst two teams are the USA and Japan. Games run for 90 minutes, where each minute in the game is actually 6 seconds.

NGR is a fantasy heartbreaker RPG; it does what you would expect out of a traditional fantasy role-playing game. While NGR will work as a complete game I have no doubt it will rarely be played as such; This game is designed expecting that you will most likely see things in this game you would like to remove and plug into your own game rather than playing it whole cloth.<br/>This game is designed to simulate low magic fantasy, but most mechanics are equally at home in a science fiction, action or post-apocalyptic game. The rules are designed to be as setting neutral as possible while solving commonly held gripes and bad tropes. In the writing of this game I used the following as guiding principles:<br/><br/>1.) Funny dice are fun on their own merits<br/>2.) Choices to make are better than problems to solve<br/>3.) You are already familiar with role playing games<br/>4.) You are not looking for gritty realism, but do enjoy the presence of the &lsquo;fourth wall&rsquo;<br/>5.) Gaming is meant to be entertainment<br/><br/>Designer's comment:<br/><br/>The game features many useful rules for plugging into your own game.<br/><br/>- Improved stealth and social conflict resolution systems that give equal strategic depth as combat in most games. This means it is not a one roll resolution and that all classes can participate.<br/>- An improved &quot;build a class&quot; section. Simple and easy to use its the &quot;Pie&quot; system.<br/>- A distinct difference between priest miracles and wizard magic. Both are better mechanically than what you will find in most role-playing games.<br/>- A simple and yet useful encumbrance system. Easy to plug into any game where you don't want players doing complicated math, but also don't want characters carrying everything.<br/>- An improved HP system<br/><br/>"}, "110228": {"rpg": {"14179": "Neoclassical Geek Revival"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Dawn of the Dork Ages", "rpgproducer": {"52824": "Zzarchov Kowolski"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1115488.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"130336": "PDF Version"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2622": "Quick Start / Fast Play Rules"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1115488_t.jpg", "description": "Subtitle:<br/>A quick start guide to Neoclassical Geek Revival<br/><br/>From the Introduction:<br/>Introduction<br/>So you or a friend of yours is looking to play a game of Neoclassical Geek Revival and don&rsquo;t feel like thumbing through 110 pages to get the feel?

You are one of these master artisans and together with your apprentice, you are competing with the other Masters to attain this elevated status in the town. To succeed, you'll have to impress the townspeople with your skills. How shall you do it? Will you acquire a specialist's mastery over certain material, or will you enlarge your workshop? Will you create a large number of smaller projects or will you build fewer, but greater, masterworks? That is for you to decide.<br/><br/>Zong Shi blends worker placement, resource management, project completion and special action cards. To set up the game, lay out the project cards (eight types, each with a special power) and masterwork projects (only three at a time) on the game board; draw goods randomly for the two markets; lay out the exchange tiles in the pawn shop; and lay out a certain number of Scrolls of Fortune and material tiles. Players take turns drafting Scrolls (which have one-shot abilities) and materials (needed to complete projects), then the first round begins.<br/><br/>In each round, players take one action with their master or apprentice, then take one action with their other figure. The possible actions are:<br/><br/><br/>    Begin a project &ndash; Master only. Pay the material cost, then place the master on the time track in the space shown on the project.<br/>    Go to the market &ndash; Hang out and shoot the breeze until the next phase.<br/>    Go to the temple &ndash; Draw one Scroll (or more if your master is at the temple and donates material).<br/>    Go to the pawn shop &ndash; Choose an exchange tile in the shop and place the exchange tile on your player board.

You can hold no more than five materials. Players then advance their master on the time track to represent work on the project. Refill materials in the market, pass the start marker, then begin a new round.<br/><br/>When a player completes his sixth project, players complete that round and one additional full round. Players tally points for completed projects, incomplete projects (which are penalized), number of townspeople visited, a full board of exchange tiles, completion of six projects and unused scrolls and material.

The discovery of gold, in one valley by the river in today&rsquo;s Yukon in Canada, had started the greatest gold rush ever related to Alaska wild-west. Get there as one of two to four gold- miners and experience one of two possible game variants this title offers. Each variant, based on different principles, stands as a complete game and offers a different gaming encounter&hellip;<br/>In the first game variant each gold-digger is in a search for the best parcels in his landscape to claim them for treasures to be gained. Golden nuggets bring victory points and rubies are to be possibly spent as resources for claim tokens in random and limited offer. In an auction player can smart out the others for strategic claim tokens or bluff them out of rubies as well. .. in other words checking on others might work a bit too! <br/>The first player, in a round based flow, who manages to dig through to the other end of his landscape, presented by four boards in a row, closes the game. However the winner is the richest gold-digger, a player with the most collected golden nuggets after the final VP count with possible penalties. <br/>The strategy and tactical decisions are made upon open information only.  The depth of pre-planning can lead to overwhelming dimension as well as it can be taken as a no rush family friendly play-style.<br/><br/>The second game variant offers exploding fun and whole different player&rsquo;s interaction. Being quick and cool headed, knowing a landscape to claim is a sure way, still outsmarting or bluffing the others might help in some cases! <br/>Winner is an experienced and ambitious gold-beater with the most popularity points for a council seat. Popularity is in relation to four down-town VIPs such as brothel madam, sheriff, mayor and horse trader. Each round player has a set of 10 unique tetris shape claim tokens to place them onto his set of four landscape boards. This happens in a race that starts with uncovering a random request card for this turn.<br/> The only closed information is the one before the moment of truth, when the picky requests of celebrities shall be satisfied.

Totality is a unique board game that combines the features of a card game with the mechanisms of a board game; it plays in the current era and simulates the total range of the human condition. The heart of the game is the deck of 64 unique and intriguing cards.  There are 4 suits of 16 cards.  These suits represent the 4 planes of existence - physical,  biological, cognitive, and social.  Each plane (suit) has 4 unique elements and a color.  Each card in the suit is composed of a combination of those four elements.  Cards have a number of elements from zero to four.   The mix of elements is shown on each card.  Each card has a game action line.  The game area (world) consists of a 4X4  array of cards laid face up and a space in front of each player to keep sets and action cards.  Players move through the world to gather cards.  Each player is represented by a marker or token.<br/><br/>Object of the game: to build the character with the most experience by gathering sets of cards while moving around the board (world).<br/><br/>Setup.  1)  Shuffle the deck; 2) Deal one card to each player.  The player with the highest card number goes first.  Players keep this card as part of their hand; 3) Then deal the 4X4 world face down.  Before play begins, each player, starting with the first, places his token in the world on a different location.  After the tokens are played, the location cards are turned face up; 4)  Deal 2 more cards to each player for a total of 3. The rest of the deck is placed face down as the draw deck (DD); place it so that the longer side of the cards is next to the world; 5) A discard (recycle) heap (DH) will be created during play; place it so that the shorter side of the cards is next to the world.  Cards are discarded face down.<br/><br/>Play.  Each turn consists of just one of the following actions unless there are effects in play that allow more: 1) Activate or remove a special effect.  The game line of most cards can create effects that change the play.  2) Move.  Movement is in a vertical or horizontal direction only (like a rook in chess).   At the beginning of the game, players can move one location per turn.  3) Gather a card from the world.  Players may gather the card under their token. 4)  Build or dismantle a set.  This is the heart of the game.  A player grows by playing sets in his character area.  Sets consist of one or more cards that satisfy specific criteria from set theory.  5.  Combat.  Combat may occur when a player (attacker) tries to move to or through a site occupied by other players (defenders), or attacks players at his current location. Combat involves betting; outcomes are governed by a simple table.  6) Open a trading session. Any player may  open a trading session his turn. Anything may be traded: token locations, sets, cards, seats, drinks.  There are two ways to end the game.  A player may end the game when he has sets with all 16 elements of the deck present.  Otherwise, the game ends instantly when the draw deck is depleted for the first time.<br/><br/>"}, "110302": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Switchblade II", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"130566": "English/European Amiga edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"14276": "Switchblade"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4415": "Amiga"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Two centuries have passed since Havoc's defeat by Hiro.

It is a trivia game with set collection and negotiation elements<br/><br/>The players' goal is to make and publish movies. Movies are made by collecting a set of matching Actors, Title, Director and Producer cards as well as enough money to produce the movie. Money and cards are collected by moving on the gameboard and answering movie-related questions. A player can only have one card of each type in hand, so if additional cards are collected (for example a second Director card), they can be either discarded or traded with the other players.<br/><br/>Movement on the board uses a roll-and-move mechanic, with a few tweaks, like no &quot;reroll&quot; spaces, and several spaces allow the player to move her game piece anywhere she wants on the board. At first players only have access to the board spaces that allow them to collect cards or money (provided they correctly answer a question). Once a player has at least produced at least one movie, she gains access to all of the gameboard, including spaces which allow players to collect cash from their produced movies.<br/><br/>Once a player has made more movies than other competitors, she can win the game by going to the &quot;Palme d'Or&quot; space and answering a special question.

No, we are not talking about your life, but about what you are up against in Infarkt (&quot;Heart Attack&quot;), a party game in which you want to be the last one left at the party &ndash; literally.<br/><br/>Each player has an individual player board on which she'll track her blood pressure, depression, lung health, weight and so on. Everyone starts out as healthy as possible, with some money ($1) in the pocket, too. Each round, a number of event cards equal to one more than the number of players is revealed. In turn, each player will choose an event card and suffer the effects of that card, moving her health indicators as needed. Did you run out of gas? Or have a bout of diarrhea? Man, life sucks.<br/><br/>Players then simultaneously deploy three action markers to indicate where they plan to go that day: the supermarket, the office, a pharmacy, a flea market, the gym, and so on. In turn order, players then execute all three of their actions in whatever order they desire. Maybe you'll hit the office to earn money, but at the cost of having your depression grow more intense. A trip to the supermarket will let you buy food, which you can then eat later at home or give to your neighbors who come to the party you throw. Force them to eat cake and get fat! If you have extra money on hand, you might want to visit the pharmacy to buy drugs; you never know what the pharmacist will give you, but if you don't like it (or the food you've acquired), you can hit the flea market to swap food and drugs &ndash; and maybe pick up some change in the bargain.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, you check your health levels to see whether your body is deteriorating without you even knowing. Get too depressed, for example, and the depression only gets worse; high blood pressure can affect your blood cholesterol level, and vice versa. If a health indicator rises to the tombstone at the top of the column, you've partied your last and are now out of the game. (Everyone else has to chip in for the funeral, suffering depression if they can't afford to pony up for a decent burial for a good friend like you.)

When a player mines for gold he draws one of the &lsquo;golden nugget&rsquo; cards and records the amount of gold found, on a score sheet.<br/><br/>During the game, the price of gold will fluctuate when players land on the &lsquo;gold rises&rsquo; or &lsquo;gold drops&rsquo; spaces, causing his gold to be worth more or less throughout the game.

Two players, X and O, take turns placing a bridge between any two of their adjacent pegs not blocked by an existing bridge. The first player to complete a connected chain of bridges between their sides wins. Ties are not possible.<br/><br/>Visavis is a Shannon switching game on the edges and belongs to the same class of connection games as Bridg-It and TwixT (and to some extend Trellis). Even though a trivial winning strategy has been found for Bridg-It (called Connexxions on the server) Visavis consists of a more complex system of overlaid triangular grids that allows richer variety of play, and no winning strategy is known.<br/><br/>Michail Antonow points out that different tactics must be applied when blocking an opponent's rightward path as opposed to a leftward path. The path can be abruptly cut by a single piece in one direction only; in the opposite direction a single bridge will only divert the path and two bridges are needed for a successful block.<br/><br/>The rules state that a bridge can be placed between any two adjacent pegs of the same colour. However since it can never help to place a bridge between the opponent's pegs, then it is assumed that all moves are made between the current player's pegs.
