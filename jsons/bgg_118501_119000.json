This version has been heavily updated compared to its predecessors. The game underwent location testing from October 21, 2006 to October 30, 2006 in game centers in Tokyo, Osaka, and Aomori, Japan, and was released on February 21, 2007. The international version was released in July 2007 which is named Initial D 4.<br/><br/>Unlike the older games in this series, which were revisions of the original title, Initial D Arcade Stage 4 has a completely new physics engine written by Sega Rosso for the Sega Lindbergh arcade system. This new system allows cars to actually slide, or drift, across the track when turning corners; this is a feature not present in the older games. Initial D Arcade Stage 4 features animated cel-shaded characters interacting with each other, while the cars and environment use updated, high-definition graphics. The cabinet has a 32-inch 16:9 LCD screen supporting WXGA resolution (1366 x 768). The gear shift has been relocated to a lower more realistic location. The Japanese version of the game supports connection to Sega's All.Net online play network, allowing players from different arcades to play against each other.<br/><br/>The player cards for saving gameplay data have been changed to IC cards like other Lindbergh games such as Virtua Fighter 5, and Power Smash 3. The player can store data such as their vehicles, modifications to vehicles, avatar customizations and time attack times. Additionally, unlike the past three versions of the game, in which the player is limited to one car per card, the player can now store data for up to three different cars. Additionally, the IC Card can be used for 150 plays, as opposed to cards for past versions which can only be used for 50 plays. Players will not be able to transfer data from versions 1 through 3 due to the changes in both the player card and the card slot. The modification system has been updated as well, as car upgrades are no longer automatic, allowing players to choose which parts to upgrade and how they spend their reward points.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Initial D Arcade Stage 4&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "118881": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Thunder Ceptor II", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"149851": "Japanese Arcade edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1561448.png", "videogameseries": {"17160": "Thunder Ceptor"}, "videogametheme": {"2280": "Crime"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2314": "Arcade"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1561448_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Thunder Ceptor II is a sequel to Thunder Ceptor released the same year in Japan.

The game focuses on team building, getting into the playoffs and winning it all. Title Chase Basketball should not be confused with a simulation. It is a game meant to pit players against each other and as such can be completed from the start of the season to game seven of the finals in about an hour.<br/><br/>The first half of the game is a card-driven game where you build up your team by improving positions, winning key games and gain ground in the standings. You will need to decide what teams surge ahead and which ones will fall by the wayside. Do you build a team of all-stars quickly and have a giant bulls-eye placed on their back for the other players to shoot at. Do you turn your team of journeymen into a solid-all around squad. Or maybe you want those one or two superstars that can guarantee you a deep run into the playoffs. The way that you build your team is up to you.<br/><br/>At the end of the regular season, the game switches to a full-on dice game using the teams you created during the regular season. Teams match up in best of 7 series where your dice are the ones you labored to improve earlier. As your dice are expended in each series, the games get closer and closer and often it comes down to one final toss of the die.<br/><br/>Although the game does not use hard and fast statistics and has no built in way to produce them, I find that it really scratches that sports itch that I used to spend hours on back in the day with Statis-Pro Basketball. With Title Chase Basketball Carla &amp; I can play it together even though she has only a passing knowledge of the sport. The game is meant to be played by players of all levels of sporting knowledge and still be fun.

The game follows the storyline of the book and film, albeit adding in new scenes to make the game more action-oriented, as well as changing the affiliation of the main villains. Additionally, it features many elements of earlier Bond films to recreate the feel of the era such as the jet pack from Thunderball (1965) and the Aston Martin DB5 that debuted in Goldfinger (1964).<br/><br/>From Russia with Love is the first title developed by Electronic Arts Redwood Shores to use an integrated game engine for the 3rd person action and driving segments. It was a new engine that was not based on any of the technology used for previous titles in the series but the result was similar to Id Tech 3.<br/><br/>The game was penned by Bond veteran Bruce Feirstein who previously worked on the film scripts for GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, and The World Is Not Enough, in addition to the script for the 2004 video game, Everything or Nothing.<br/><br/>The game's soundtrack was composed by Christopher Lennertz. Additionally, Vic Flick, best known for playing the original guitar riff in The James Bond Theme announced that he contributed to Lennertz's score.<br/><br/>Unlike in the 2004 game, Everything or Nothing, From Russia with Love features a third-person multiplayer deathmatch mode, however it lacks a cooperative feature that was present in Everything or Nothing.<br/><br/>One of the most obvious changes to the story for the video game is the absence of the villainous organization SPECTRE, who played a vital role in the film. Due to legal issues that have plagued the James Bond series of films since 1963, the organization was renamed as OCTOPUS and appears to lack a central leader in the same vein as Ernst Stavro Blofeld. The SPECTRE name was tied up in a long-running dispute over the film rights to Thunderball, between United Artists/MGM and the now-deceased writer Kevin McClory.<br/><br/>The game begins with a standard pre-title sequence in which Elizabeth Stark, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom's daughter, is kidnapped by OCTOPUS while attending a party. Fortunately, Bond was assigned to attend the party for just such an event, and he defeats OCTOPUS and rescues Stark.<br/><br/>Similar to the film, OCTOPUS has conceived a plan to embarrass British secret service agent 007 for the death of Dr. Julius No from the film Dr. No, in which No was an agent of SPECTRE. The plan involves the theft of a Soviet encoding machine known as the Lektor with the help of a defecting Soviet agent, Tatiana Romanova. Romanova, however, is being used by OCTOPUS to lure James Bond into a trap; their ultimate goal is to let him obtain the Lektor and then ambush him for it, killing him in humiliating fashion as well. Romanova is sent by Rosa Klebb, an agent of the KGB (in both the novel and film, an agent of SMERSH) who has secretly defected to OCTOPUS. Her immediate subordinate, Donald &quot;Red&quot; Grant, protects Bond through the first half of the game and attacks him in the second. The game ends with a final assault on OCTOPUS headquarters.<br/><br/>New characters:<br/>    Miss Elizabeth Stark: Stark is the daughter of the British Prime Minister, whom Bond rescues in the pre-title sequence.<br/>    Eva Adara: The driver and henchwoman of Red Grant. She is both a driver and pilot. She is ultimately killed in the level &quot;Octopus Base&quot; where she attacks Bond with a parked fighter jet. When it is damaged to the point where it is about to be destroyed, she flies down the underground runway at Bond who is using a jet pack. Bond easily avoids her plane which then smashes into the closed hangar doors at the end of the tunnel. Her role in the game was, however, minor.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;James Bond 007: From Russia with Love&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "118911": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Wizz Quiz", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogameversion": {"149905": "North American Arcade edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1549951.png", "videogametheme": {"2319": "Cartoon"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "6", "videogamegenre": {"2314": "Arcade"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1549951_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Wizz Quiz is a trivia game from Konami in the mid '80s.

It is the first Kamen Rider fighting game to be released onto the PlayStation 2 since Kamen Rider Kabuto. The game was released as part of the 10th anniversary of the Kamen Rider Series by Toei, TV Asahi, Ishimori Productions, and Bandai. The game spawned several updates for the Wii and PlayStation Portable consoles as well as an American version for the Wii based on Kamen Rider: Dragon Knight.<br/><br/>Combat in the game operates on a basic three-button system, encompassing Weak Attack, Strong Attack, and Special Attacks (such as the various Rider Kicks). In addition to this, each Rider has the ability to perform a Form Change once the Rider Gauge at the bottom of the screen fills, whether by dealing or receiving damage or by charging the meter. Form Change can be used as a counter or to extend combos. A number of Riders also have the ability to summon Strikers, such as Ryuki's Contract Monster Dragredder or Den-O's DenLiner. Also, each Rider has a unique finisher called Rider Finale. This attack can only be activated when the Rider Gauge is full and press the R2 button.<br/><br/>In Decade Mode, the player follows Tsukasa Kadoya's journey through the nine Heisei Kamen Rider worlds as Kamen Rider Decade, fighting the other Riders and attempting to prevent the destruction of the worlds. Decade Mode differs from standard gameplay in that Decade's Form Change and Special Attacks are customizable with KamenRide Cards and Final FormRide Cards earned as the player progresses. The missions in the mode are divided by three levels, with the easiest missions can be played in Level 1 while the hardest can be found in Level 3. Level 2 and 3 can be unlocked as the player progress in Level 1.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Kamen Rider: Climax Heroes&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "118918": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Thunder Cross", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"149912": "North American Arcade edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1561449.png", "videogametheme": {"2318": "War - Future"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2314": "Arcade"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1561449_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Thunder Cross is a scrolling shoot'em up from Konami.

A joint action between two players like a screen or a &quot;pick&amp; roll&quot;, a team tactic like playing in the zone or a man-to-man defense, faithfully recreating what happens in a basketball game. Thanks to its mechanic, mixes a great realism in the actions with high simplicity. Players move one by one alternating between attacker and defender, not the entire team at once, making play faster. This makes the duration of a turn variable, so you play four quarters like in a real game but not a predetermined number of turns in each quarter.<br/><br/>Passes, rebounds, fouls, two-point shots, lay ups, three-pointers, dunks, freethrows, blocks, pick&amp; roll, steals... any basketball action is possible in this game!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"150002": "English/Spanish first edition"}, "age": "12", "name": "Solo Baloncesto", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "average": "7.84048", "usersrated": "21", "boardgamefamily": {"23287": "Crowdfunding: Verkami"}}, "118965": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Envoyer (Issue 85 - Nov 2003)", "rpgproducer": {"19936": "Christian Fischer"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1216945.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"5242": "Envoyer"}, "rpg": {"310": "Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"150003": "Softcover"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1216945_t.jpg", "description": "This issue contains the adventure &quot;Bringt mir den Kopf von Elektra Jones&quot; for Cyberpunk 2020.

The players work together to solve the mystery by collecting evidence and eventually arresting the suspect.<br/><br/>Complicating matters is the fact that there may or may not be a corrupt officer that is being paid off by the murderer to suppress evidence, the same evidence everyone else is trying to uncover.<br/><br/>Players move around the city searching through randomly shuffled investigation cards for evidence in relation to the murder.  The number of investigation cards drawn depends on the character&rsquo;s rating as well as how many player cards are added by other players to boost the character&rsquo;s rating for the current &ldquo;search&rdquo;.  There are four decks of investigation cards (Interview Witness, Collect Crime Scene Evidence, Examine Body and Locate Murder Weapon) to be searched.  These decks are shuffled and placed in different locations.  So, a player might search the cards in one area and not find any evidence at all&hellip; or maybe the bribed cop, if there is one, did the searching and just said no evidence was found.<br/><br/>Players have to find all of the evidence cards from the investigation decks to be able to arrest the murderer.<br/><br/>At the end of each player&rsquo;s turn they draw an event card.  These cards represent growing crime and emergencies that are happening in the city.  Each one piles on top of the other, and if the cops don't stay on top of things, they will be buried in crime!  These Event cards are placed on the game board at the locations where they occur.  Some of them have &ldquo;unknown circumstance&rdquo; tokens placed face-down upon them, adding even more tension.<br/><br/>If too many criminals are located in one area, a gang is formed.  Each gang has its own power and can cripple the police efforts if not handled quickly and carefully.<br/><br/>So, not only are the players investigating the murder, but they must also arrest street criminals and handle emergencies.<br/><br/>Sometimes when a character successfully completes a task, that character is rewarded with a doughnut token.  These tokens can later be used to help with tasks.  However, if the character does not complete the task in time, the city crime track advances.  The track can also advance if street crimes grow so large that no more street criminals can be placed, when called for.  If the Crime Track advances to the end, the murderer escapes justice and the good cops fail the game.<br/><br/>To add to the tension even further, The good cops only have so many days to complete the investigation.  If time runs out, once again the murderer shall escape justice!<br/><br/>The pressure is great and the stakes are high!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"148712": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.03008", "name": "Police Precinct", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "1295", "boardgameaccessory": {"158832": "Police Precinct: Custom Dice"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"5496": "Thematic Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "118537": {"boardgamedesigner": {"57585": {"name": "Christian Diedler"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Fortress Sevastopol", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2021": "Area-Impulse"}, "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2383633_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"2674": "Andreas Bertram"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"570": {"name": "Udo Grebe Gamedesign"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2383633.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"148714": "Command & Strategy edition"}, "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "October 1941: After the initial success against the Russian &ldquo;Bear&rdquo; in the summer of 1941 the German advance slowed down. Hitler advised the commander of the 17th Army, General Erich von Manstein, to take the Crimean Peninsula and the important port of Sevastopol before the winter weather would set in.<br/><br/>After a quick successful campaign with the final conquest of the Crimea as its goal, the German Wehrmacht should have gained itself a good stepping stone for the next summer offensive to reach the most important oilfields of the Caucasus. Also the mighty Black Sea Fleet would be disloged to the far away port of Batumi...<br/><br/>But history took a different turn. The initial assault failed to take the fortress. The Russians counterattacked in the winter with some success. And so Manstein&rsquo;s final conquest of the mighty Crimean fortress lasted until July 1942 when there were no more Soviet fighting formations on the Crimea.<br/><br/>Fortress Sevastopol is a simulation of the German assault on the Crimean Peninsula. The Germans had to advance to Sevastopol as quickly as possible. Eventually the mighty fortress will have to surrender before the snow falls, which would be a great pleasure for the &quot;F&uuml;hrer&quot;. If not, you will have to wait until spring to receive more reserves and finally capture Sevastopol before the game ends.<br/><br/>If you play the Russian side: stay cool! Try to avoid losses in the initial onslaught. Collect units and reserves in the winter months for an eventual counterstrike at the German weak points. If this is unsuccessful, go for entrenchments and fight for every meter in Sevastopol til the end.<br/><br/>Fortress Sevastopol uses an easy to learn area movement and combat system. A similar system was already used in games like Breakout Normandy, Monty's Gamble - Market Garden, and Storm Over Arhhem.

Create a nation according to your political ideals and care for its people. Or deliberately oppress them. It's up to you.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>Jennifer Government: NationStates is a multiplayer nation simulation browser game. It was created by Max Barry and was  based loosely on his novel Jennifer Government. The game is expanded by users using off-site forums to construct centres of learning, discussion and play.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to lead a country in the way the player finds best. At the start of the game, the player chooses a few basic characteristics including country name, flag, motto, currency, national animal and style of government. Answers to the questions in the next page determine the initial ratings of the country's civil, economic and political rights. The nation's population starts at five million and increases every day automatically with play.<br/>Issues<br/><br/>Gameplay hinges on deciding government policies: the player is presented with automatically assigned &quot;issues&quot; and chooses a response from a list of options. Players can ignore issues by dismissing them, which has no effect on the nation. All issues have a peculiar characteristic, and no option is the &quot;correct&quot; one. Each usually has a positive and a negative aspect, although the latter is usually highlighted, and both are always exaggerated. Many issues are posed in terms of radical or extremist beliefs, and the accompanying opinions are rarely well-founded. This is for both humorous and didactic reasons: many opinions are extremely funny or ridiculous, and the player learns that there are no perfect ideas which will work in every case. As gameplay progresses, the user learns that each of the options provided for the proposed issues become more ridiculous and offer no stability to the nationstate. Although this is a simulation game of creating your own nation, the responses are often unrealistic and do not provide many middle-ground options to resolve the issues. Instead, the issues are used to drastically change your nation's economic, political, or social beliefs. As a whole, the issues do not directly relate to real-life situations but rather a more Barry-like nation-state as presented in Jennifer Government.<br/><br/>There are occasional &quot;Easter Egg&quot; issues, such as one that dealt with piracy on the high seas, released to everyone on International Talk Like a Pirate Day. Other special issues appear after nations have achieved certain population-growth requirements, allowing players to choose a leader, capital city and national religion.<br/><br/>The player's responses to issues (except for dismissals) affect the nation's status in three main factors: the level of Political Freedoms, Civil Rights and the strength of the Economy. Decisions can also affect other aspects of the nation, such as the crime rate, industry strength and public sector spending.<br/><br/>Based on the nation's personal, economic, and political freedoms, the nation is assigned to one of 27 government types, from Scandinavian Liberal Paradise and Capitalist Paradise to Corporate Police State and Psychotic Dictatorship. The &quot;other variables&quot; are used to compile the game's daily World Census Reports (formerly the &quot;United Nations Reports&quot;), which list every nation in the game in order of their rank in that day's chosen variable, such as Largest Manufacturing Industry, Largest Soda Pop Sector, Highest Unemployment, Safest Nations, Most Rebellious Youth, even Most Avoided Nations. The reports also group nations according to region, so a nation may be described on their main page as &quot;1st in the region and 94th in the World for Smartest Citizens.&quot;<br/><br/>The nation's main page briefly describes the population, government, economy, that day's World Census ranking and latest policy decisions resulting from the player's choices. The 'National Happenings' section at the bottom of the page shows ten of the most recent events, which includes World Assembly activities and changes to the nation's characteristics (e.g. Motto, Currency, etc.).<br/><br/>Each decision passed through legislature will eventually have an impact on each attribute. Nations tend to lean heavily on decisions that involve the country's economic status.  Unlike the benefits derived from higher Economy levels, having &quot;Excessive&quot; or &quot;Frightening&quot; Civil Rights is not necessarily a good thing, since the nation's government would be lacking control and requiring some kind of reform. World Benchmark would be considered the best ranking that can be achieved. The same applies for Political Freedoms.<br/><br/>Players may voluntarily join the NationStates World Assembly (abbr. WA), making their nations automatically affected by the decisions of that body. However, various players role-play disobedience. Discussions on draft/proposed resolutions take place on the forums, often home to all manner of political debate.<br/><br/>The World Assembly was known as the United Nations before 1 April 2008. On that day, the fictional organization was renamed in response to a cease-and-desist order from the actual United Nations.Though initially believed to be an April Fools Day joke, the legal complaint was revealed to be real the next day. References to the &quot;United Nations&quot; or the &quot;UN&quot; were universally replaced on the official website, but remained in old forum posts and some fan-operated websites.<br/><br/>Since May 2009, the World Assembly has had the power to &quot;commend&quot; or &quot;condemn&quot; specific nations or regions.  The new feature, apparently intended for out-of-character recognition of players rather than the nations or regions they play, has been criticized by players for &quot;breaking the fourth wall&quot; and thus running contrary to current rules dictating what proposals can legally be submitted to the WA.<br/><br/>Nations are grouped into regions. New players begin in one of five Pacific regions (and resurrected nations begin in Lazarus, Osiris or Balder) and may move their nations into any other region at any time, or set up their own. Many regions have an elected leader, or Regional WA Delegate, and some participate in complex regional governments, though some contain only a handful of nations.<br/><br/>Players occasionally attempt to collectively &quot;invade&quot; another region by entering it and seizing control of the regional Delegacy, though it may be hard to garner and coordinate support. Within the game, this process is called &quot;raiding&quot;. Some regions have password protection to stave off such attacks, but this presents a problem of getting new members to join the region and a small risk of a spy infiltrating the region.  Many multi-regional organizations have formed - either to organize invasions or to organize those who defend against raider play.<br/><br/>Invading, &quot;raiding&quot;, or &quot;region crashing&quot; first became prominent with a group of players calling themselves the Farkers (now referred to as invaders or raiders), who all arrived from links between the game and the website Fark.com. Steps have been taken to reduce region-crashing and griefing while regulating the more benign invasion types. In order for one nation to eject another from the region, it must have a specific amount of &quot;influence&quot;, which is partly derived from that nation's length of residency within the region. This helps ensure that invaders do not flood a region, install one of their own as WA Delegate, and then eject the original members from the region. These regulations have been heavily praised, although others greatly opposed it and claimed that it ruined the game experience.<br/><br/>NationStates' relatively simple simulation has given rise to more in-depth and freeform role-playing, with players using their nations' statistics to measure how their nations would fare in international trade, diplomacy, and war. Some players have even developed complex statistical calculators.  Part of the appeal of NationStates lies in the ability to create an unrealistic utopia (or dystopia) as the subject of conversation and political philosophy, without needing to worry about practical matters, like national defense, that might become factors in a more comprehensive simulation. Many players do tend to play realistically and maintain at least sensibly constructed economies.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Jennifer Government: NationStates&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "118574": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Superhero League of Hoboken", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"148802": "North American DOS CD-ROM edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2095463.png", "videogametheme": {"2509": "Comedy"}, "usersrated": "5", "average": "7.3", "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2095463_t.png", "description": "Superhero League of Hoboken is a computer game from Legend Entertainment, designed by interactive fiction designer Steve Meretzky.

By the early 1900&rsquo;s, many of these territories had been lost to Great Britain, however one of significant import remained: the East Indies, which would later become modern day Indonesia. Little Holland controlled the resources of an island empire of some 40 million people, rich in the resources &ndash; oil, rubber, tin and other metals - that would ultimately drive the industrial economies of the 20th century.<br/><br/>Covetous eyes watched the development of this region with interest. Japan made numerous inroads with trade missions, while more radical voices called for outright conquest, Germany expressed interest in obtaining island bases there (if not overall acquisition), while Britain stood by, intent that no other nation which could pose a threat to her interests should gain control the islands. Fears of Japanese aggression led the Dutch to consider a vastly expanded Koninklijke Marine with modern dreadnoughts to defend their prize.<br/><br/>Dutch East Indies is a 64-page book supplement for the Great War at Sea series, focusing on battles which could have and in some cases did take place in and around these islands over the period 1914-1917. Conflicts between the navy the Dutch considered but never built and Japanese invaders (and others) are explored, along with historical battles and hypothetical situations arising as the principal maritime combatants of the Great War, England and Germany, struggled for control of the seas. There are 35 scenarios, or separate game situations, as well as background articles presenting the history of this Dutch territory, the politics of the Great Powers around it, and the ships that fought or might have fought there. In addition, a campaign game is provided, for those wishing to examine the challenges and surprises that would have faced Dutch and IJN planners in a 1916-1917 Japanese invasion of the East Indies.<br/><br/>This supplement contains no pieces or maps; ownership of Pacific Crossroads, Jutland, Cruiser Warfare and the operational maps from Strike South (from the Second World War at Sea series) is required to play the majority of the battle and operational scenarios, while Mediterranean and Dreadnoughts are needed to enjoy them all.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"148980": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.38889", "name": "Great War at Sea: Dutch East Indies", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "9", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "expands": {"11694": {"name": "Great War at Sea: Cruiser Warfare"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"19898": "Cities: Jakarta"}}, "118591": {"poll": {}, "name": "Marketeer", "playingtime": "4500", "minplayers": "8", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "120", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "boardgameversion": {"149002": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "4500", "boardgamecategory": {"1016": {"name": "Science Fiction"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "4500", "description": "A &quot;persistent world&quot; multiplayer boardgame designed to be run continuously for at least 48 hours, preferably more.<br/><br/>Marketeer is a card-based sci-fi exploration, trading and combat game in a persistent board game universe.

Interceptor Doll HoiHoi-san), is a manga by Kunihiko Tanaka that spawned a PlayStation 2 game.<br/><br/>In the year 20XX, insects have become immune to all pesticides. To combat the rising plague of cockroaches and other household pests, the tiny, doll-like extermination androids known as &quot;Hoihoi-san&quot; were created. They can hunt down insects and kill them with such miniaturized weapons as minuscule machine guns and tiny combat knives. They can also (and at the same time) be treated as dolls, by dressing them up in costumes and buying accessories for them. The main robot of the anime wears a maid uniform and rabbit ears as accessories.<br/><br/>This third-person shooter game aims at completing levels and defeating hordes of various kinds of insects, all while avoiding collateral damage to furniture and other household items. Completing a level gives the player credits with which one can buy upgrades for the Hoihoi-san, ranging from the useful like missile packs, ammunition and weapons upgrade but also less useful items like new clothing and new voices.<br/><br/>In the game, the muzzle blast is about the size of the robot, which combined with an impressive rate of fire makes for a definite statement in the girls-with-guns genre. A modicum of style, finesse and Japanese tradition is retained by featuring a katana in the weapons selection. The game allows the player to use both a katana and a machine gun at the same time.<br/><br/>If the player acquires all Hoihoi-san accessories, the backdrop turns pink on returning home.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Hoihoi-san&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "118621": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Hummer Badlands", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"149174": "English/European PlayStation 2 edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2456": "Driving"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2154": "Racing"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Hummer Badlands is a racing game that involves off-road racing in a Hummer vehicle.<br/><br/>For single player, there are Extreme Off-Road Two areas: Granny Gear and Pike's Peak.

Abenteuer - Mitbringspiel.<br/><br/>In this game, a goblin has cast a spell on all the children in town, locking them in their houses and &ndash; more importantly for the game &ndash; making them forget who owns the dog Bronco. Your goal is to find out which child owns Bronco so that the pooch can go home, get something to eat, and perhaps even wrangle a bit a ear-scritchin' from his young owner.<br/><br/>To set up the town, lay out ten houses in a four-row grid, with intersection tiles placed between the houses. Shuffle the children tokens, then set one aside and place one next to each house. Shuffle the ten keys face-down, and place one on each house.<br/><br/>On a turn, you first roll the die, which allows a peek at a key or a free move of Bronco to any house, or forces the clock to advance an hour or the intersections next to Bronco to rotate, possibly cutting off access to nearby houses. The player then moves Bronco to an adjacent house, if desired, then reveals any key on the board. If that key matches the house where Bronco is currently located, that child is freed and the number of suspects as to who owns Bronco drops by one; if the key doesn't match, return it face-down to its previous location and advance the clock by one hour.<br/><br/>The game ends one of two ways: Either the players free all of the children and therefore deduce which child remains as the owner of Bronco, or the clock hits 12; in this latter situation, the children can make one guess as to who owns Bronco, then reveal the hidden child. If correct, they win! If not, Bronco heads to the pound to live out the rest of his life filled with sorrow and self-loathing...<br/><br/>Reimplements:<br/><br/>    Wer war's?

It's up to you to determine under which sheet the real spirit is hiding as well as which color candle it's holding. To do this, players must make use of the mirrors in the castle surrounding the figures as everyone knows that true spirits don't cast a reflection...<br/><br/>To set up for the game, each player receives a search tile showing a symbol, and 16 candle chips (each showing one of four colors and one of four symbols) are mixed and placed facedown on the spaces on the circular track. The mechanical doohickey in the game board &ndash; which lowers mirrors out of sight when one of the ghosts is used to crank a gear in the board &ndash; is set up. You secretly place one of the four colored candles in each ghost, then set them on the game board.<br/><br/>On a turn, you roll the die. If you roll a number, you move a ghost of your choice the number of spaces indicated to try to land on a candle chip. If you do land on one, you reveal it, keeping the chip if it shows your symbol and leaving it faceup on the board otherwise. If you roll a ghost, you can conduct a mirror test, take a joker move, or do both. For the mirror test, you take one of the ghosts, place it in the center of the game board, then crank the gear (as each ghost has a coglike thing beneath it). If the mirrors disappear, you've found the real ghost! If not, you'll see the ghost reflected in a mirror and the angle of the mirror allows you to see the candle color; announce this color to all players. For a joker move, you move a ghost to any space of your choice to try to collect the chip on it.<br/><br/>Once you have all four of your chips, you immediately test a ghost of your choice to see whether the mirrors fall. If they do, you need to then name the color of candle it holds. If you fail either test, you're out of the game and play continues until the next player tests a ghost.

Fortunately, being a peaceful people you have chosen not to fight over what little there is. Instead, you set out in your seagoing Wa&rsquo;a (canoe) to fish and gather crops from the many nearby islands. The fertility goddess Haumea has blessed these islands, and they are rich with fruits, vegetables, and spices. It is a matter of pride to collect the finest harvest for the village. Can you win the race against time and the sea, and prove that you are the best gatherer of all?<br/><br/>In Tahiti the goal is to collect crops (coconuts, taro, bananas, spice) and fish from the surrounding islands to score points with bonuses for making full sets and acquiring the most of their family favorites which are hidden from the other players.<br/><br/>The game starts off with just your home island and its immediate neighboring islands. Players build up the archipelago of fertile islands with the guidance of Haumea for the first part of the game until all islands are in play. Players seed the islands each turn giving them some control over where crops replenish. Once the archipelago is formed, the late season is triggered when crops start becoming scarce, with players occasionally stopping an island from producing altogether. Although the late season may not be as good for crops, fishing becomes easier with bonuses given to the waters around some of the islands.<br/> During all this the players travel by Wa&rsquo;a from island to island using action points to collect the crops they want or can get to before the others take them. As the Wa&rsquo;a fills, it becomes slower limiting the number of actions they have. There are also treacherous reefs around the islands that require you go around them or risk losing some of the crops aboard your Wa&rsquo;a.
